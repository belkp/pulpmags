  hlemper a hotel a saloon and
  gambling - house combined a
  mexican barbershop a stage

     	stable several stores and a
fringe of houses shacks and cabins the
town squatted in the pass between the
purple peaks witch-talk and rain-maker
looking out on the desert that stretched
leagues to the south in chains of mesquite-
cluttered below-sea-level basins barren
sun-rotted hills and wind-swept mesas

  uncle charlie hemper brooded in his
throne-like chair on the wide porch of his
hotel the hemper house his sockless
feet were incased in carpet slippers sized to
house a jackrabbit his vast linen trousers
annoyed him not his white shirt ever
collarless fitted him as easily as a blanket
and his pipe drew freely yet on his
florid face surmounted by a gray thatch
and seamed with tiny trails of humor was
an expression that betrayed a gnawing
inner irritation he rumbled deep disap-

proval as a dull thumping sound issued
from the upper precincts of the hotel
apparently some one was putting down a
carpet

  pap tuttle the oldest man in hemper
approached the hotel on his daily round
tick-tack of greasewood stick and whisper of
congress shoes a thin sigh and pap had
found a chair

  the landlord used pap as a word sink
one might shovel words into the withered
ancient for a fortnight and be sure he would
not resurrect them in the garb of gossip

  uncle charlie gave pap a gloomy side-
glance

  wont be any hotel left he grumbled
by the time things are in shape to suit that
niece of mine pap she wrote me that she
had to have a bedroom for herself and a
settin-room too then a bedroom for the

money my sister mary their mother
married a rich feller name of wayne both
dead now and them two children with
nothin to do but spend the intst on a
mountain of money

  he paused and glanced down the desert
road

 there comes king norn on his big
pinto-but as i was sayin that girl sure
wants things to suit her im all upset
with gettin ready for em pap im get-
tin too old for change and pullin and haul-
in but ill have to bear with them
the boys sick and theyre my own flesh
and blood

  pap took out a plug of tobacco cut into
little half-severed squares out of courtesy to
his toothlessness broke off a square and
placed it in his mouth for several mo-
ments he stared vacantly at the landlord
then his adams apple began running up
and down excitedly in a voice squeaky

from disuse he abruptly questioned-

  girl good lookin

  of course you old coot uncle charlie
fluiig-athim indignantly all my wimmin
folks were good-lookin my sister was the
finest-lookin girl in missouri

  fap arose at a slant and wagged his
head gloomily he helped himself to a
fresh quid and made a futile gesture as
though warding off some impending disaster
and scuffed away

  i hope muttered the unreasonable
uncle charlie virtuously i never get like
that-always a-lookin on the dark side of
things and a-gruntin if things dont move
along in the same old way

  chang the old chinese who ruled the
hemper house kitchen grunted hopelessly
as maria one of his assistants dropped a
dish indians were fat sleepy fools on
whom one might not depend even to boil
water maria ignoring alike changs glare
and the pottery fragments moved over to
the window and peered out shyly

  king norn looked up from tying his
horse and saw the round brown face
framed in heavy black braids peering at
him through the window

  he laughed at the quaint picture she
made he had known maria since she
was a roly-poly baby playing in the sun
and she held a warm spot in his affections
he held up a warning finger

 dont move close your eyes and
dont move ive a present for you

  she obeyed his instructions shutting her
eyes tightly and holding out her hands
he reached quickly into his saddle pocket
and brought to light what appeared to be a
ball of down this he placed in one of her
outstretched hands she opened her eyes
quickly startled by the warmth of the live
thing she held

  a young mocker i found by the road-
side take care of him maria and he will
sing for you

  she gently smoothed the fledgling the
while she gave the man little shy glances of
adoration he had thought of her bring-
ing to her who was named mocking bird a
little mocking bird she fully appreciated
the delicate compliment but though she
could speak three languages she could think
of no fitting words to express her joy she
could only give the man a full adoring
glance-a glance in which there was the
poignant pain of a womans love but
norn was blind to that glance she was
still the little brown one to him as he
smoothed the fledgling in her hands he
failed to notice how her fingers raised to his
as steel to magnet and the sharp intake
of her breath at the seemingly accidental
contact

  he patted her head admonished her to
take good care of the mocker pointed his
finger at her cocking the thumb as though
shooting at her and paused to see her smile
he had always been able to make her smile
then he whirled and strode toward the
front of the hotel calling out a hearty
greeting to uncle charlie and vaulting over
the side rail of the porch

  set down invited uncle charlie
fumbling for his tobacco hows things
goin on out to your place he did not
wait for norns answer but went on
hurriedly my niece and nephew are
cornin in on todays stage house all torn
up he aimed a wicked blow at a fly
missed and sighed resignedly your
rooms ready if you figger on stayin in
tonight	

  norn seated himself on the floor of the
porch drawing up his feet turk fashion
and looked up at the old man in the chair
a mixture of amusement and affection in
his eyes

  it will be good for you to have your
own flesh and blood with you the young
man said

  uncle charlie admitted the truth of
the survivor



norns statement with a nod but his
expression displayed little enthusiasm

  younguns take a lot of work and
always change things change always
bothers a man as old as i be although
gawd knows im as good as i ever was
i dont notice the time but its been quite
a spell since i unyoked my bulls in this
pass and your paw come over from the
ranch and give me the hand of friendship
your paw was a great man king i felt
like id lost a brother when he crossed the
big divide but everything changes
nothin stays yesterday this pass was
a mess of greaseweed catclaw and cotton-
woods today she holds a town and the
stage gets in regular tomorrow a railroad
will come along and the hemper house
wont be good enough for the soft ones that
ride on cushions perhaps ill be gone
then hope so

  norn settled his head back against a
pillar knowing that uncle charlie had to
do a certain amount of mental wandering
before striking the main trail of thought

  what i was goin to say the old man
concluded was that id like you to meet
my niece and nephew the boys sickly-
like-lungs i guess-and i may be askin
you to take him out to your ranch for a
spell as for the girl ive give up tryin
to jigger out what to do for her theres
nothin here for a girl

  no echoed norn sympathetically
there is nothing here for a girl

  the rancher thought of the life he led
free as that of any barbaric prince hem-
per would be a prison to a woman used to
crowds and light and laughter he could
only endure about so much of it and then
new york london or paris to become an
immaculately-garbed spectator of the thick-
flowing city life then weariness and
boredom and finally a swift winging
back to his beloved mountains and
desert

  but uncle charlies niece would have to
remain with her sick brother no pleasure
trips to break the monotony of life in a
mans town on the deserts edge must
be an unusual woman to make such a sacri-
fice still he did not propose to entangle
himself in the destinies of uncle charlies
relatives they might come out to his
ranch that sprawled in the lap of rain-
maker and hunt and fish but he wouldnt
clutter up his life with their troubles

the main street of hemper quick-
ened into life the stage from the
west was due in a few minutes
men came strolling toward the hotel look-
ing at their watches the arrival of the
stage from the west was a momentous
affair to the citizens of hemper though
they pretended to treat the event with
lofty indifference

  chance hardy the cold-eyed flat-
cheekboned black-haired proprietor of the
saloon and gambling-house across the street
strode over to the hotel porch greeted norn
casually and settled himself in a wicker
chair he lighted a cigar flicking out the
match with a supple white finger

  uncle charlie waddled into the hotel
office and secured a huge telescope steady-
ing the telescope against a porch pillar
he fitted the eyepiece under a shaggy brow

  then triumphantly-

   there she is-just cornin over the last
raise

  with a bear-like shamble he returned
to the office carefully replaced the telescope
on its ancient pegs and sought the kitchen
to spur chang to action breathing heav-
ily he returned to the porch running a
hotel was strenuous work

  old pat the stage-driver usually at-
tempted a flourish as he came into hemper
he cracked the long whip and halted the
steaming leaders on a line exactly even
with the porch giving himself the indiffer-
ent air of a conquering hero he was
king of the reins and not for gold or
precious jewels would he do anything but
drive the four the removal of baggage and
mail was the work of menials and he would
not demean himself by lifting a pound

   the stage door opened and a large fleshy
well-dressed man with a round dimpled
chin stepped down gingerly fearful of
getting dust on his shining shoes he gave
the loungers on the porch a cursory glance
and pushed his way past uncle charlie

  driver what have you done with my
baggage

   pat looked down at the big soft face and
drawled insultingly

  i got something else to do besides
thinkin about your baggage leastwise
i didnt eat it

  the fat man retired in confusion and
the loungers on the porch smiled grimly
old pat was a hard pill

  uncle charlie was giving various orders


adventure

to marias father who had come from the
rear of the hotel to care for the baggage
the old man was excited and sought to
conceal that unusual condition by bellowing
orders at the patient old indian

  norn still retained his seat on the floor
of the porch not deigning to look at the
stage he was not posing the arrival of
the stage meant nothing to him for he had
a vast stock of memories of cities and
strange places from which to draw comfort

  presently a thin boy in knickerbockers
descended from the stage

  dickie yelled uncle charlie seizing
the lad and lifting him from the ground
im your uncle boy

  dickie smiled politely the old man
gave his nephew a hearty smack and gently
pushed him toward theporch the boy
saw norn seated on the floor and smiled
faintly as the man gave him a friendly glance

  poor youngsterthought the rancher
he has arrived just in time

  uncle charlie thought at first he had a
touch of sun-stroke he had always
boasted that his sister was the most beau-
tiful girl in missouri but he was not
prepared for the vision of beauty that
descended from the stage assisted by the
fat stranger who seemed to have pre-
empted the part of cavalier then pride
of blood surged up in the old man this
calm gracious beautiful woman was his
niece

  uncle charlie she murmured and
slipped her arms around the old mans neck
and kissed him

 gone forever were uncle charlies
grumblings concerning the trouble that
relatives make an old man she stepped
fairly into his heart a rich emotion
welled up within him

  darned old fool i am dora im so
blind i cant see you he held her off
at arms length but all he could say was
oh girl oh girl

  the fat stranger attempted to escort
miss wayne to the porch but uncle
charlie gave him a terrible glare and put
a proprietary arm around his niece

 chance hardy arose and norn not
looking up but knowing that a woman was
present got to his feet the other men
stepped back awkwardly

  this is mr hardy uncle charlie
began proudly mr hardy my niece
miss dora wayne

  hardy raised his dark gaze to the cool
violet eyes of the girl and flinched inwardly
as he noted her loveliness the utter warm
womanliness of her his hands tightened
until his knuckles whitened he removed
his hat and bowed with a grace that sur-
prised those who knew him the girl
lightly acknowledged the pleasure of meet-
ing mr hardy

norn was the last to be presented
he bowed and then as their eyes
met he imagined that he felt a
sudden stab of pain in his chest-a pang of
the spirit that could hardly be distinguished
from physical pain he strove to speak
marveling at the fact that he a man of the
world was stricken dumb but he gath-
ered his forces and managed to remark-

  doubtless you have had a hard trip

  even as he spoke he noted the sickening
inanity of his words

 oh no she coolly returned i
greatly enjoyed it

  she was moving toward the office door
dickie had taken her hand and uncle
charlie was holding her arm the fat
stranger sprang forward to open the door

  each man on the porch cursed himself
for a blockhead not one of them had
said anything worth while and not one had
thought to open the screen door the
fat stranger clung to the happy trio until
they reached the stairway then he re-
turned to the porch and introduced himself
to the somber-faced hemperites as g
holden brown interested in the resources
of the country-ahem no one made any
comment and one by one the men of
hemper departed leaving the stranger in
possession of the porch hardy however
gave the fat man a deadly ophidian stare

  that fat stranger thinks well of himself
hardy remarked over his shoulder as he
and norn entered the saloon

  hardy norn thought was already at-
tracted by the girls beauty

  the bartender knowing the ranchers
habits set him out a glabs of mineral water
hardy joined him taking a cigar at his cool
invitation

  says hes interested in the resources of
the country sneered hardy g holden
brown hey g holden mush would be
better

  yes concluded norn hardy was inter-
ested in uncle charlies niece else why
the survivor



should he be annoyed at the prancing of
the fat stranger the hardy way with
women was cold utterly selfish and brutal
to the extreme a smile as cold as star-
light on snow crept into norns eyes
would that violet-eyed dark-haired full-
blown woman travel the trail of those the
gambler had discarded if that was the
hardy plan he would endeavor to block it
but why a man was free to seek any
woman again that pang-that curious
pang intuition told him that hardy was
about to comment on the girls beauty
he must escape before the gambler mouthed
her name didnt like the idea of talking
about any woman in a saloon yes that
was it-any woman

  he fairly flung himself from the saloon
and hurried to his horse he felt a desire
to get into the desert silence and classify
and brand the unruly thoughts milling in
his mind

  as he vaulted into the saddle he glimpsed
billy snake a piute renegade prowling
in the cottonwoods near the road the
indian as the rancher dashed down the
desert road stared after him with eyes
that flamed murderous hatred

  now billy being of mature age greatly
desired a squaw and had selected maria for
that honor but her parents being mis-
sion indians looked down on the vagabond
piute and refused him the hospitality of
their cabin back of the hotel kitchen

  billy had then threatened marias father
with various unpleasant deaths promising
lastly to cut out the old indians heart and
eat it raw a furious gabbling had ensued
uncle charlie hearing the clamor had
rushed back and incontinently kicked the
piute into the road

  and then to add to the black rage
bubbling thickly in his heart billy had
seen norn give maria the fledgling

  maria had prepared a nest for the mocker
in a cigar box resolving later to weave a
little cage of willow withes for the belpved
birdling she missed seeing norn depart
uncle charlie having sent her up-stairs to
begin her duties as maid to his niece

  doras beauty the richness of her garb
made the shy indian girl feel as though
she had been appointed handmaiden to
some divinity dora gently instructed her
in her duties which were light and simple

  mrs milliken a motherly soul whom
uncle charlie has secured to take charge

of dickie arrived and proceeded to win the
heart of the boy

  when dora had excused maria for the
afternoon the indian girl returned to her
fledgling and took it out to the step of the
cabin there with many murmured en-
dearments she wove for it a little cage of
willow withes

  billy snake crouched low in the shadows
of the cottonwoods maria could not see
him from where she sat but he could plainly
see her at her labor of love when the
time of reckoning came the gift of the white
man would be destroyed perhaps the
white man would follow the way of his
gift-

  billy had come to town with a message
from certain desert rovers to hardy tliat
message had been delivered and he had
been slipped his reward a quart of whisky
he would return to the desert and drink
the whisky the water of fire that gave
a man the courage to do and to dare any-
thing would tell him how to destroy the
white man and his gift-and how to secure
the squaw

   so thinking he sought his pony tethered
beyond the cottonwoods and sped back to
the desert

   the little cage grew in the deft hands of
maria ah he had remembered her-
had brought her a gift a living bird that
would in time sing to her sweetly and
her soul in anticipation of the bird-song
sang blithely within her

  old chang in the kitchen door shook his
head she an indian girl made too much
of the white mans gift but that was a
womans way like a child playing in the
sunlight all heedless of the coming of night

chapter ii

as norn struck the edge of the
desert down to which the pass
abruptly sloped he asked himself
the strange question was it possible for him
to become seriously interested in any
woman did they not all talk the same
talk knowing the love of one was to
knowr the love of hundreds but a recur-
rence of that curious pang wrung from him
the admission that this woman who was
named dora wayne might be different

   there was a sphinx-like air about her a
slumbering mystery she rested secure in
her beauty looking out on the world of


adventure

contending men serene and indifferent
here was no ordinary beauty merely skin-
deep doubtless many men had des-
perately endeavored to rouse her interest
she had traveled the world over she had
many memories of men she knew their
word-formulse their strutting egotisms

  what then admitting an interest in her
would a man have to do to attract her
attention long he pondered that ques-
tion perhaps a circle of danger drawn
around her would eliminate many men but
she could always give any man safe conduct
with her smile a man might encircle her
with gun-smoke and she could dispel it with
a little smile

  yes many men had come to her with the
old hackneyed phrases parading their self-
imagined virtues and beating the drum of
egotism

 what of the stranger-g holden
brown-whose well-tailored clothes failed
to conceal the lumps of superfluous flesh
uncle cliarlie had said nothing of his niece
having a business manager possibly the
fat anafifwas one of those blatant idiots a
gain or a stage acquaintance he gave
brown considerable thought knowing that
not infrequently a wise woman is won by
that glib persistent type

  then she might be engaged to be married
but no solitaire had warned no tres-
passing not that a ring would make
any difference he had always told him-
self that when he met the right woman
no bar of society would hold him back
providing she favored him

  granting then that no rival in the outside
world gripped her thought there remained
only the desert men the fame of her
beauty would travel across the wastes
with the mysterious swiftness of thought
hard-bitten bronze-jawed men would
travel through heat and dust to gaze upon
this aphrodite sojourning for a time amid
earthly surroundings having once viewed
the goddess they would think no thoughts
save the long thoughts of her

  but he anticipated only the strong
would have an opportunity to worship
at her shrine then he considered that
mysterious weakness of woman recalling
several wonder-women who had mated
with scrawny insignificant men and did
not dora wayne treat her weakling brother
with great tendei-ness

  norn rode straight into the desert basin

beyond the pass in which hemper cuddled
the basin was guarded on the south by
witch-talk mountain and on the north-
west by rain-maker

  witch-talk was so named by the indians
because of periodical rumblings within its
bowels at such times the savages de-
clared the witch was talking and
hastened to propitiate her with gifts to
the southeast from both peaks ran ranges
of barren desert hills

  witch-talk imposed his mighty bulk
between the ocean rains and the desert
but occasionally some persistent and in-
trepid cloud would creep around the
shoulder of the mountain and battle with
the sun only to be vanquished and retreat
in a mist of childish tears

  at such times a rainbow would smile
across the pass as though to comfort the
defeated cloud

  over that desert basin nature often
projected a moving picture of the moods
of every zone a storm raging on the peaks
rain and darkness in the pass a light
shower over the edge of the basin and to
the east a clear sky and a blazing sun in
the basin grew the semi-tropic wild palm
but in a few hours ride one could be in
deep snow amid giant pines to norn
there was a never-ending charm to the
desert basin that called him back from his
world wanderings again and again

  he headed for a lonely group of palms
that lifted their proud heads some twenty
miles from hemper there his riders had
constructed a board shack and a horse-
shelter there was always a little food
in the shack it was one of several camps
scattered about over his cattle range
beneath the palms a sort of salt grass grew
thickly and there was open water

  norn loosed his faithful pinto he had
not eaten since dawn and he was ravenously
hungry he shot a rabbit with his saddle
gun dressed it and soon had it sizzling in a
frying pan over a camp-fire in front of the
shack he made a sort of dough-god
of corn-meal and propped it up by the fire
he thoroughly enjoyed the meal though
he had sufficient money to have had a
sumptuous meal served him in that camp
he preferred the simple and primitive

  he threw several chunks of mesquite
on the glowing embers and then drew back
a little into the shadows

  what a friendly thing is a lire talking
the survivor



to one with little intimate whispers inter-
spersed with crackles of laughter how
many lonely weary adventurers have seen
from afar the beckoning flame of a friendly
fire and tightened belt and quickened pace
and how many incautious men in the
lonely places have forgotten that the little
fire innocently tells tales to those who
prey

  the desert night deepened and over the
black serrated crest of witch-talk the stars
seemed to be signaling one another with
pulsations of radiance

  some sense of an alien presence made
the rancher seize his rifle and leap to his
feet and back into the deeper shadows
through the mesquite he caught a faint
gleam of steel he eased his rifle forward
covered that faint gleam of steel and
waited finger pressing back trigger thumb
holding hammer

the lightning-like disappearance
of the white man disconcerted billy
snake who had been craftily ma-
neuvering through the low-hanging mesquite
to get a clear view of the mocking-bird-
giver and to close the account with one
shot perhaps norn who men said
was like a panther in the night was now
watching him waiting for the slightest
hostile move the indian was not equal
to the strain and suspense he arose
making a loud pretense of stamping down
the mesquite and stalked into the circle
of firelight

  drop your rifle twanged norn from
the gloom

  billy obeyed knowing that death beck-
oned

  then the rancher came from the shadows
seized the indians shoulder and turned
him around that the firelight might illumi-
nate his crafty countenance the white
man looked deep into the glittering eyes

  havent i always given you grub he
demanded

  billy snake nodded sullenly

  then why do you creep up to my fire
like a coyote in the night

  me come speak for bundy said the
piute me no see norn by fire me
look long time-maybe nudder man by fire
sabe

  yes i sabe said norn releasing the
savage but that is indian talk your
heart is bad against me

  billys eyes grew dull as a snakes in skin-
shedding time the white man was mock-
ing him trying to trap him with words

  bundy him come now said the indian
finally and seated himself on the ground
by the fire

  a moment later norn heard the clink
of spurs and rat bundy followed by
several members of his gang entered the
circle of firelight

  saw your fire bundy opened with
great pretense of friendship and billy
offered to come and see if it was you or one
of your riders

  norn gave the indian a chill smile

  billy snake slowly reached for his rifle
and having secured it backed away
mumbling something about watching the
horses

  bundy and his men all heavily armed
dropped down into various positions of
comfort around the fire

  norn remained standing holding his rifle
with apparent carelessness but in such a
position that it easily dominated his self-
bidden guests between him-and the
bundy gang of cattle-rustlers and man-
killers existed an armed truce it was
understood that in time of need the gang
might kill a norn steer but they must
not waste the meat or sell it this agree-
ment had come down to norn from his
father and the leader of the gang that had
preceded the bundy aggregation the
agreement had followed a battle between
the elder norn and the old gang in which
the former had been victorious to such an
extent that the remaining outlaws resolved
to patch up a truce with him

  the old gang had never broken the truce
and so far as king norn knew the bundy
gang had observed it faithfully the
bundy gang saw in king norn a more
relentless man than his father and had no
desire to risk the loss of members they
knew would surely follow an open break
they might kill king norn but the price
of his life was too high better eat his
beef and keep on friendly terms then
bundy was not the indomitable wolf of the
desert that the old gang leader had been
this latter fact coupled with that of no
visible degeneration in the norn stock held
the old truce intact

  thought we might drift into town
tonight bundy said lazily cool
ridin
io

adventure

  the rustler was attempting to make
conversation but norn gave him no
encouragement the rancher wanted to
be alone with his thoughts

  silence oppressed bundy he stirred
uneasily and proceeded to let his tongue
rattle

  billy snake come from town today
he says hempers folks come in

  norn was in no mood to discuss the
arrival of hempers folks with what he
considered desert scum bundy fumbled
for a twig to light his cigaret

  billy says and the outlaw leader
smirked broadly that the girl is ace-high
for looks he laughed coarsely as he
raised the blazing twig to his cigaret ill
soon have a good look at her good-
lookin fillies are scarce in this mans coun-
try im goin to- 

  you stand no chance cut in pete
bundys first lieutenant let her get one
look at that horned-toad face of yours and
youre through

  oh idontkjiow drawled bundy
good-fiaturedly i may not be pretty
but i got a winnin way

  pete snorted derisively

  winnin way he repeated several
times with infinite sarcasm i got money
that says you couldnt hold a mex senoritas
hand if she was asleep

  the other members of the gang laughed
hoarsely they were used to the bantering
between their -chief and his lieutenant
but in the patrician heart of norn seethed
a white rage these animals were dis-
cussing her he knew the sliminess of their
minds

  the blatant egotism of bundy regarding
his ability as a winner of womans favor
was now in full and noisy action

  he flipped his cigaret stub into the fire
and turned to taunt pete

  tell you what ill do pete bet you a
hundred gold agin your black hawse that
im the first man in this country to kiss
the new girl

  he unbuttoned his shirt and began
clawing at his money belt

  pete made no reply to the offer since he
was gazing fascinatedly at norn who was
bending toward bundy

  the outlaw leader looked up and what
he saw in norns eyes made his hand cease
its money-belt fumbling and stray down
toward his weapon

     in norns eyes was the cold
sheen of bayonets his nostrils flared
and his lips were parted in a terrible
smile the members of the gang were
absolutely motionless each man knew
that the slightest move would precipitate
deadly action norn might be killed but
several of them would die before he suc-
cumbed to the gangs lead

  pete had no illusions concerning his own
woman-winning powers and bundys weak-
ness filled him with contempt for the man
who held his leadership largely through the
dominance and power of a man who sat in
town-chance hardy

  rat snarled pete youd better lay
off that fool talk then to norn con-
ciliatingly rats head needs fixin

  bundy saw that his gang was not in favor
of precipitating a battle with king norn
and for some reason norn was displeased
with the talk concerning the girl probably
norns way he had heard the rancher did
not favor talk concerning any woman

  he raised his pale eyes shaded by sun-
bleached brows to norns deadly gaze

  no harm meant norn he half-apolo-
gized with a nervous laugh pete and
me are always drivin back and forth
like that

  norn backed into the shadows some
of the men arose and stretched pete
glanced contemptuously at bundy he
was a poor sort for men to tie to no policy
no mind to see down the trail some day
he pete would grow weary of playing
second to such a bungler and then the
voice of bundy would be heard no more in
the land

  there was now no good reason for pro-
tracting their stay at the norn camp

  well adios said bundy as they moved
toward the mesquite

  norn made no reply he watched them
as they made their way through the mes-
quite cursing the malicious thorns he
heard bundys coarse laughter as he
launched some ribald jest and the reproving
grumble of pete

  the voice of bundy insolent and raw
came drifting back to him

  the bet with pete goes as it lays yelled
back the outlaw chief

  then the dull plomp-plomp of hoofs in the
sand and at last silence

  norn made a vain attempt to analyze
his feelings why had bundys blatting
the survivor

ii

aroused in him the killing rage was it
solely because of his chivalry or was it
because that he was growing weak he
knew that the only true method was to
waste no time in rage or emotion but to
plan quickly and then act still now that
he was calm he could not blame bundy
so much the man was proceeding accord-
ing to his light

  it came to norn that were the kohinoor
lost in the desert and some slow fool found
it he would not long hold it he would
soon be destroyed and he who finally held
the kohinoor would be a man in whom the
will to live had the combined strength of
those who had died striving to hold the
jewel one at a time they would perish
until finally came the strong man they
who strove to hold the kohinoor might not
be blamed though one expressed his desire in
terms of filth and another in classic lan-
guage

 a jewel of a woman-a kohinoor of
beauty-had come to a little town on the
deserts edge but the kohinoor lacked
one quality the woman possessed she
could say who should be the guardian of
her beauty her word was final after
men had struggled suffered dared and
died she might say-

  away with them all

  but bundy and his ilk did not recognize
her power of choice in their thick egotism
they imagined that they had only to pursue
seeking the elusive woman they would
meet death face to face they did not
know that the high-caste woman must be
attracted not pursued

  the rancher flung himself down and
attempted to sleep a rattler buzzed
faintly and he arose hunted out the snake
and killed it with his quirt

  his warning brought his death mut-
tered the man the fool among snakes
what folly it was to think he walked
beyond the palms and looked out at the
gray waste and up at the paling stars all
his furious mental scurrying to and fro was
caused by a woman who was now calmly
sleeping he laughed harshly

  then he walked back to his horse and
petted it talking to it childishly he even
secured some wisps of grass and rubbed
down the animal

  dawn came with glowing bronze bars
across the eastern sky and rain-maker
shimmering in opalescent haze a light

breeze stirred the dry beards of the palms to
faint cracklings and elusive whisperings
then the thin querulous morning song of
the coyotes

  soon the keen smell of frying bacon and
aroma of boiling coffee arose to mingle with
the tang of greasewood and aromatic
shrub

  norn smiled though a mans soul
roamed the stars his clamoring stomach
must be appeased

  through a notch in the mottled hills the
red sun winked wickedly promising the
desert a scorching day norn mounted
and trotted back to the stage road that
twisted like a wounded snake across the
basin coming to the branch road leading
to his ranch he reined in hooked a leg
around the saddle horn and debated
then the final decision closed his lips in
a thin line and he turned and galloped
toward hemper

chapter iii

bundy was hardys choke and
therein lay the true source of the
bundy chieftainship the gang-
ling cattle-rustler was very pliable in the
hands of the gambler hardy knew that a
more positive character would not long
bring him tribute while he sat in soft ease
in the town

  hardy handled the money derived from
sales of stolen cattle and horses allowing
himself a liberal commission ultimately
the bulk of the money he turned over to the
gang found its way back to his safe via bar
and gambling-table

  of course like any feudal chief hardy
protected his men loaning them money and
paying their doctor bills men not oper-
ating with the gang but necessary to the
hardy welfare came in for a share of his
largesse among his partisans he num-
bered complaisant officers of the law who
instead of hunting down the gang spent
most of their time in hardys saloon ma-
king no move without consulting him
hardys saloon was the courtroom of the
desert country and to a large extent the
gambler was judge and jury

  but between uncle charlie and the
gambler existed an agreement as to division
of territory uncle charlie was to control
the hotel and not to be disturbed or an-
noyed by the hardy partisans hardy was


adventure

to keep his men under control and not per-
mit them to annoy the peaceable citizens of
the community or to disturb hemper
house guests uncle charlie though a wise
man in all other respects had a pet delusion
regarding his position in hemper he re-
garded himself as a sort of perennial mayor
of the place

  in this delusion hardy indulged the old
man consulting him on affairs of no im-
portance the desert men the gambler
knew regarded uncle charlie with the ven-
eration they might accord an old landmark
this combined with the fact that the old
man was no mean warrior held the hardy
policy close to the line of indulgence

  at times various members of the gang
made some pretense of working in the mines
or riding on the cattle round-ups but gen-
erally they were swinging back and forth
from the pass to the mexican border
heavily armed superbly mounted and in
search of booty there were other gangs
operating across the mexican border and
the cattle-rustling industry was fairly well
orgaiazectat times the gang would make
alittle side-venture and relieve some un-
wary travelers of their valuables but they
carefully avoided stage hold-ups and wisely
refrained from invading the thickly-settled
country west of the pass they had no
desire to bring a flock of san francisco and
los angeles deputies down on them

  bundy and his men racked into hemper
in the early morning leaving their horses in
the stage stable corral and headed straight
for the saloon where they expected to meet
hardy and receive some hard-earned gold
hardy however was asleep in his room
over the saloon and the gang dulled the
sharp edge of impatience with several
rounds of drinks billy snake who had
brought them the news of the gold being at
their disposal was handed a big drink
through the back window

  breakfast was next in order and they re-
moved their belts and secreted their guns
inside their shirts uncle charlies rules
forbade armed men entering his hotel and
they thus evaded any clash with the landlord

  that one big drink had elevated the
spirits of billy snake until he believed him-
self to be the equal of any white man
vaguely he recalled a certain disagreeable-
ness on the part of the old man who ran
the hotel but that was a small matter
he was hungry and would eat with the

man he served he joined the gang as they
clattered into the hotel office

  uncle charlie reached back of the table
that served for a desk and secured his old
buffalo gun an octagon-barreled sharpes
the great rifle called for a cartridge that
might pass as the offspring of a field-piece
shell a sort of brass bridegroom of death
with a paper collar around the bullet he
who was hit with a bullet from that gun
need not worry about doctor bills uncle
charlie claimed that he had killed seven
apaches with one shot from the old bel-
lower  the indians were in single file and
one bullet sufficed for the unlucky seven
according to the bland statement of the
landlord

  whats that injun doin in here roared
the irate old man i kicked him outn my
backyard once do i have to shoot him
out of this place now

  bundy turned and regarded billy with
well-feigned polite surprise

  well he drawled finally an injuns
got to eat same as white folks

  then send him around to the kitchen
door and see that he behaves himself any
shenannigins and ill unhook on him

  go around to the kitchen bundy or-
dered his runner and dont get funny
back there with the help

  billy snake retired sullenly his eye on the
muzzle of the great rifle

  move quick uncle charlie warned
him this trigger pulls easy

  the indian hastily retreated

  uncle charlie tenderly replaced his rifle
in its sacred corner

  ought to have got that injun he told
himself mournfully hes a bad one i
ought to have got him

  the gang clumped into the dining-room
and were soon immersed in trencher-toil
consuming vast quantities of bacon and
pancakes bundy looked about him
eagerly expecting to see uncle charlies
relatives enter and seat themselves at
the family table pete grinned as he read
bundys thoughts bundy would never
make good his boast of being the first man
to kiss the new girl

billy snake brooded for a time
in the cottonwoods and then
slowly approached the hotel kitchen
door maria was in the kitchen preparing
breakfast for dora and dickie which she
the survivor



would later serve in one of the living-rooms
up-stairs chang was the first to see the
indian in the doorway and his fingers
tightened on the bread-knife he held

  charlie say me get grub all right said
the indian to chang but with his burning
eyes on maria

  chang pointed at the clock and made a
gesture with the knife that told the indian
that the chinese would serve him in his own
sweet time

  the whisky fumes flared up in the in-
dians brain and he stepped into the
kitchen maria sidled back against the
kitchen table as she realized the paiute was
coming toward her his hand reached out
to clutch her she seized a pan of dish-
water and flung it full in his face chang
then sprang into action he dropped the
knife seized a ladle of hot grease and
sprayed it over the bewildered indian
billy beat a swift retreat howling like a dog
chang secured more ammunition and stood
ready to repel any attack the while he
emitted weird shrill chinese expletives

  the gang in the dining-room heard the
commotion and tipped over their chairs
and crowded into the kitchen they
surged out the back door in time to see billy
snake do a mad dance and tear his thin
shirt from his body they laughed bru-
tally and bundy indulged in such wild
mirth as to acquire a severe case of hic-
cups billy tore the last vestage of his
shirt from his body and then dashed toward
an irrigation ditch into which he plunged
and rolled uncle charlie had seized his
rifle and had broken all his speed records
in a dash to the back door of the kitchen

  ill have to kill that gosh-blanked injun
yet he bawled to the tittering hiccupping
bundy this is the second time hes tried
to get gay with maria ill sure bust him
next time chang give him a dose he wont
forget though

  the gang returned to their trencher-toil
laughing and commenting on billys intric-
ate dance steps

  i swear gurgled bundy that injun
stepped like a turkey on a hot iron i
wouldnt a missed it for a pair of new boots
first maria with dishwater and then the
chink with hot grease billy sure has
troubles with his courtin

  the gang leader interspersed his food-
shoveling with inane titters and explosive
hiccups

  uncle charlie returned to the office
rumbling disapproval of the whole affair
his face was a thundercloud as the gang
came from the dining-room and paid him
for their breakfasts

  the men drifted out on the porch and
paused to roll cigarets slowly they strag-
gled across the street to the saloon and
began gambling they would dip deeper
into the fleshpots of hemper when hardy
came with the big money derived from the
last sale of stolen cattle

  bundy however preferred whisky to
gambling and when hardy strolled into the
saloon the cattle-thief was pleasantly in-
toxicated taking a large friendly view of
himself considering all things possible
what he bundy desired to do he would
do nothing could stop him he had made
a certain bet very well in good time he
would win that bet but barring pete the
members of the gang had forgotten the bet
for bundy was prone to make boastful
declarations which  he sometimes made
good but more often later waved aside as a
mere joke among themselves ilfe-tagn re-
ferred to him as windy

  hardy called the gang into a card-room
and gave them their share of the cattle-
money in good red gold they immedi-
ately returned to the games

  bundy was oiling his physical and mental
machinery for an unusual effort several
times he sought the front door to inspect the
hotel porch no girl in sight yet a
drink and a dollar or twro on roulette
then he secured his cartridge-belt from the
bartender and performed a little dance
no one paid any attention to him he was
enjoying himself which was his sacred
privilege

  but bundy had failed to note the arrival
of king norn who had ordered a helper at
the stage barn to place his pinto in a stall
it was too early for the regular dinner but
chang at uncle charlies request and a
liberal donation from norn prepared for the
rancher what is technically known as a
short order

  while norn was eating dora and her
brother sauntered down-stairs and out on
the porch intending to take a little stroll

  bundy meanwhile had made his way
down to the stage barn corral and saddled
his horse he rode into the main street of
hemper noted the girl on the porch and
proceeded to show off he was drunk but


adventure

in full control of his physical machinery
the whisky had merely expanded his ego-
tism causing him to believe that he was all-
powerful and the cleverest creature ever re-
leased by kindly nature

  dickie was greatly entertained by
bundys cowboy stunts and frequently
called his sisters attention to the feats of
the rider bundy would fling down his
handkerchief whirl his horse and race
back leaning from the saddle to snatch up
the handkerchief then he would waggle
his head and look at the impassive girl on
the porch as though to say-

  look at me didnt i do that clever

  but the girl was not interested in the
riding and the cowboy stunts of the flam-
boyant creature with the wide mouth
she had wearied of buffalo bills wild west
show with its picked riders and she had
yawned when a cossack officer in moscow
had put his whole troop through its paces in
honor of her drunken bundy cheap and
sordid with his little tricks was of no more
interest to her than an organ-grinders
muujrtfpt

  she arose and murmured to her brother
that they would take a little walk dickie
linked his arm in hers and they walked
down the steps and turned toward the line
of cottonwoods beyond the irrigation ditch
norn came out on the porch as the girl and
her brother approached the ditch

  a few of the gang including pete had
been attracted from the games by bundys
street performance they stood watching
him hardy spoke sharply to pete

  better tell bundy to quit that he
snapped and returned to his little sanctum
at the end of the bar near the entrance

  as the girl and her brother strolled toward
the irrigation ditch bundy whirled his
horse so intent was he on handling his
horse properly and turning the trick neatly
that he failed to see norn near the side rail
of the hotel porch

  suddenly the girl was aware of the bulk of
a sweating horse and then a long arm
whipped around her waist whisky fumes
and a beastly face lowered to hers then a
form descended on the horses croup and the
beastly face was jerked back she caught
the flash of a gun as norn snatched
bundys six-shooter from the holster and
tossed it aside the girl staggered back
but dickie realizing that the rider had at-
tempted to seize his sister broke into shrill

boyish imprecations and strove to break
from his sisters detaining grasp

  norns left arm was now a rope of steel
around bundys neck the rustler in-
voluntarily spurred his horse and the ani-
mal plunged across the ditch and on
through the cottonwoods pitching and
bucking with his double burden bundy
lost the reins and both men were hurled
to the ground norn was up first and
jammed his knee in the small of bundys
back while he wrenched the rustlers right
arm back and up bundy answered with a
groan from the depths of his being

  convinced that the six- shooter had been
bundys sole weapon norn leaped back
from him bundy gained his feet and
stared stupidly at his assailant

  norn slapped him with his open hand

  fight snapped the rancher

bundy gave a wild squeal of rage
and charged down with fists swing-
ing like flails norn could have
knocked him cold but he wanted to save
him for punishment so he proceeded to
send in hard heart-shaking blows to certain
vulnerable parts of the bundy body
bundy followed the evasive rancher about
whining like a dog and cursing but norn
whipped in a terrible blow to a spot just
under the heart and bundy paused to meet
the agony that followed but he had no
more than met that agony when the norn
fist struck him dully in a point over the
short ribs and more agony followed this
was repeated many times then norn
began on the mans solar plexus sending in
blow after blow until it became a quivering
center of agony

  billy snake glowering over his grease
burns watched the fight with awe the
man who was his master could not touch
the mocking-bird-giver billy did not like
fist-fights they struck him as nasty work
a knife would be much quicker and cleaner

  bundy was now whistling like a wind-
broken horse and norn shifted his attack
to the mans face and head he proceeded
to batter the bundy features to a pulp
carefully refraining from striking the base
of the jaw then suddenly from the bloody
lips of the rustler broke the thin whine that
seeps from the innermost core and calls for
the mercy stroke

  norn shifted lightly to the left and swung
on the base of the bundy jaw with his full
the survivor



weight back of the blow bundy sank
slowly to his knees and then sprawled over
on his back

  norn returned to the hotel to find uncle
charlie resting his sharpes against a porch
pillar his old eye blazing across the sights
at a group of men in front of the saloon

  they were goin to interfere the old
man gritted but i sort of made em change
their minds did you whup him good

  norn made no reply but glanced at the
girl who regarded him coldly he went into
the hotel washroom apparently she had
no garlands to place on his manly brow for
having trounced the very life out of the man
who had attempted to kiss her well he
couldnt blame her much it was tiresome
disagreeable business and she was doubtless
disgusted with the whole male population
of hemper but he could not have done
any different whether she liked it or not
bundy would no more seek to attract her
attention he washed his face and hands
and removed the soil of battle from his
clothing

  i guess mr norn nearly laid that man
out remarked dickie if id been big
enough i would have laid him out you bet

  his sister smiled indulgently and then
sighed wearily after all that man norn
though greatly touted by her uncle was
like all the rest of them ever seeking to
show off his brute strength ever parading
his masculinity still it was a manly
tiling to relieve her of the annoyance of
the creature on the horse she was forced
to admit that norn had made no parade
following the fight he had merely glanced
at her

  she recalled the strutting italian officer
who had fought a duel with a fellow-officer
because he imagined that by such means
he could gain her favor the italian had
come to her after the duel boasting of his
swordsmanship and had been surprised and
crushed beyond measure when she dis-
missed him abruptly then there was the
new york clubman who had trounced an
imagined rival in front of her apartments
after the fight the clubman had come to
her expecting to be garlanded with her
favor instead she had told him that the
greatest favor he could show her would be
to remove his being from her presence for-
ever therefore she gave norn a small
credit-mark for not running true to the
usual masculine form

  uncle charlie was replacing his rifle in
the corner when norn came from the
washroom

  sleep said norn laconically and
sought the room uncle charlie always re-
served for him

  and she never even thanked him the
landlord marveled aloud what kind o
wimmin are they raisin these days

  the menace of uncle charlies rifle re-
moved pete ran out to inspect his chief
he found bundy on all fours making feeble
attempts to gain his feet

  pete returned and reported bundys
condition to hardy who was fairly boiling
over with rage

  bundys through rasped out the
gambler get him out of town and look
after things yourself dont let me see
him or therell be a funeral how often
have i told the- and here hardy affixed
certain descriptions of bundys ancestors
and general weaknesses- to keep off the
street and leave strangers alone

  but hardys rage was not caused by any
high-flown desire to keep intact-theace
of hemper but by the low-browed bundy
even daring to think of looking at the woman
that he hardy had selected for himself

  pete hurriedly jerked the gang away
from the games and the bar and drove them
to the corral there with much grumbling
and cursing they saddled their horses
they rode over to bundy who was now
wandering about like a sick burro

  pete reined in and surveyed the whipped
man disgustedly

  norn certainly done a good job on
you he jeered you look like youd
been run through a stamp mill here
jerry you and tom throw this mess on
his hawse

  he didnt fight me fair bundy sud-
denly began wailing when the two men
had heaved him into the saddle he hit
me with a club

  pete turned to billy snake who was still
clawing at his burns

  how about it billy

  no club declared billy quite em-
phatically for him hand dis way and
he pantomimed the action of striking with
the fist and grunted bundy him cry
like woman norn go way

  pete laughed raucously and gave bundy
a contemptuous cuff with his open hand
the while he flouted him
i

adventure

  so you squealed did you i always
thought youd squeal well youre through
and see that you keep your head shut
bundy did not resent petes open-handed
smack but lurched over the saddle horn
broken and cowed

  the gang lashed their former chief with
contemptuous glances and on reaching
the main camp at the foot of witch-talk
proffered no aid to the beaten man let
the squealer bind up his own wounds

  hand over that hundred pete de-
manded as bundy almost fell from his
horse hand it over or ill start in where
norn left off

  bundy fumbled at his belt but was un-
able to get out the money pete roughly
relieved him of the money-belt and milked
it of five twenties and threw it down at
the vanquished ones feet

chapter iv

hardy waited until uncle charlie
had replaced the buffalo gun in its
rortier anti resumed his throne on
-the porch slowly the gambler crossed
the street giving the landlord time to get
his pipe going the hardy mission was
one of peace he knew that the girls uncle
held him responsible for the bundy affair

  hardy wagged his head apologetically
as he reached the porch steps

  charlie im sorry about bundy both-
erin miss wayne i had no idea the
drunken fool would go so far

  uncle charlie began smoking in short
quick puffs and hardy noting that sign
of rising temper hastily added-

nothin like that will happen again
the landlord arose and menaced the
gambler with his pipe bellowing his answer
in a voice that could be heard the length
of the street

  youre right it wont happen again
if it does somebody gets a piu from my
old betsy he wont cough up chance
hardy ive got along with you for years
but when it comes to my folks i wont
stand no foolishness from you or no livin
man twas your whisky that made bundy
lay his filthy paws on my girl and if king
norn hadnt half-killed him id a done the
job myself dont curry me the wrong
way chance im old but my fingers
still steady on the trigger and dont you
forget it

  hardy affected a contrite air since he
believed a state of war between uncle
charlie and him meant the girls disfavor
it wrenched him to mollify the landlord
for to condemn bundy was to praise norn
and he was already secretly raging at
norn for having seized the leading part in
the little play

  i dont want any bad feelins between
us charlie i sent the whole bunch out
of town after this my bartenders will
cut em short

  the old man dropped back in his chair
and puffed moodily after all no great
harm had been done norn had given
bundy a lesson he would not soon forget
and hardy had apologized still the
landlord cocked a suspicious eye at the
gambler sensing insincerity but he finally
waved his hand as though putting aside
something worthless and rumbled-

   all right let it pass

  the gambler forced a smile of relief and
returned abruptly to his saloon

  dora as was her custom with disagree-
able memories had erased that of the
creature men called bundy from her mind
but thoughts of norn lingered irritating
her slightly surely she could not be ex-
pected to seek him and like some rural
heroine in a comedy drama thank him for
having come to her rescue she finally
flatly refused to consider any phase of the
affair and ordering maria to pull down
the curtains composed herself for a siesta

  in the evening after supper assisted by
maria she arrayed herself in a white dress
and threw a gold bespangled scarf over her
shoulders not that she had any inten-
tion of queening it on the porch but it was
pleasant out there and dickie liked to
hear the men talk also dickie needed
the fresh air

  the light from the big lamp in the office
streamed out through the double window
and softly illuminated the porch there
were big easy cane chairs and inviting
rockers uncle charlies chair reinforced
with rawhide to hold his weight was near
the side of the porch that the old man
might rest his slippered feet on the railing

  the gleam of the girls white dress and
the glitter of her spangled scarf were as
mystic magnets to the men of hemper
attracting them slowly but surely to the
porch they came with various flimsy
little excuses that made uncle charlie
the survivor



puffing contentedly in the shadow smile
knowingly

  but to the girl the men worshiping at
the shrine of her beauty were merely a part
of the atmosphere she rarely spoke
seemingly occupied with some mysterious
feminine introspection that made them
more desirous of attracting her attention

  g holden brown was ever in close at-
tendance the girl was aware of his
presence as she might be aware of some
handy automaton that opened doors for
her and now and then brought her a glass
of water

  abner twill hempers lawyer with
whom brown had held several mysterious
conferences now felt it necessary to eat
supper regularly at the hemper house
prior to the arrival of the girl abner had
limited himself to a sunday dinner at the
hotel his finances being at such a low ebb
as to hold him close to bacon and beans
cooked in the little room back of his musty
office but now he was splurging mag-
nificently a covetous eye on the girls
money a rich wife would lift him into
certain political strata in los angeles
where he might run for congress

  the lawyer as he eased his bony frame
into a rocker gave g holden brown a
little calculating glance brown was evi-
dently deeply interested in miss wayne
for various reasons he must not annoy
brown still he would hold his place in
the circle as a guest of the hemper
house he had a right to indulge in a little
light comment

  twill had a habit of punctuating his
remarks with knuckle-cracking he would
pull his long bony fingers until they popped
like firecrackers and when he delivered
a speech his joint-popping took on the dig-
nity of rifle fire

  a wonderful beautiful evening miss
wayne he breathed

  pop

  how balmy the air

  pop pop

  is not nature miss wayne glorious in
her calmer moods

  pop pop pop

  that last series of pops was too much
for uncle charlie

  suffrin moses ab bawled the old
man desperately leave your jints alonel
sounds like you was pullin yourself apart
makes me nervous stop it



  that silenced abner twill unless he
popped his finger joints he could not talk
unless he talked he merely occupied so
much space

  dickie stared fascinatedlv at the funereal
twill

  let him crack his fingers uncle char-
lie begged the boy its fun

  the lounging men laughed and poor
twill placed his hands back of the chair
out of the way of temptation

  g holden brown launched an alto-
voiced panegyric on natures moods wind-
ing up with some fragments of a lecture
he had been forced to attend to please
some san francisco friends

  feelingly he sighed-

  how often have i pondered upon the
metamor-

he checked himself cun-
ningham the hemper doctor had
just arrived and brown was not
sure but what the word he held by the tail
was some medical term so he-released
the struggling word and went on smugly-
at least we may be sure that to us the
allness is almost entirely without loquac-

loquacity-

  ive got a mighty good loquat tree
back of my shop interrupted bill watson
the blacksmith if thats what youre
talkin about

  doctor cunningham tittered neatly
old bill had innocently tripped up this
wordy stranger brown groped in a men-
tal fog and finally gave up the idea of
awing the hemperites with words and
thus attempting to prove to miss wayne
that he was a man of her own caste

  the doctor ventured to relate some medi-
cal experiences but no one evinced any
interest apparently the girl was not
aware of his existence and the physician
noting certain hostile glances from some
rugged males decided to return to the
companionship of the skeleton in his dreary
office

  having decided to call on uncle charlies
niece the reverend nittin wrestled with
himself in prayer he would interest her
in church work and would refrain from
any wicked personal feelings she was
beautiful beyond all power of words to
express and he must fortify himself with
prayer ere he wandered within the range
of temptation he was encumbered with
i

adventure

a peculiar egotism he believed that tempta-
tion lurked in the highways to pounce upon
the pure and good yes he would call
and interest her in church work and later
if she insisted he might make her his wife
her wealth would build a church and res-
cue him from starvation

  and so the little sheep man wandered
forth among the wolf and panther
men

  hardy had joined the worshipers on the
porch but had attempted no excuse
when the reverend nittin arrived with a
murmured good evening the hardy
brow darkened he had thought of giving
the little preacher some money to build a
church but now there would be none of
his gold forthcoming he moved into the
light and stared malignantly at nittin
norn refreshed by his afternoon sleep sat
in the shadowy corner of the porch farthest
from the girl he smiled at the effect of
hardys malignant stare

  i took the liberty of calling on you
miss tvvlavne-lh  eated the minister faintly
-sfmrng to wrest his fascinated eyes from
hardys hypnotic glare i feel that a
great deal of good can be accomplished

if-

  he seated himself gingerly

  hardy hitched his chair closer to the
minister and his dark eyes took on an
agate sheen

  how are you this evening mr hardy
baaed the minister his hands fluttering

  im well as usual flung back hardy
chill menace in his voice

  the minister with a desperate effort
wrenched his gaze from the gamblers
gleaming eyes and faced the girl

  i trust sister wayne-

  at this point dickie arose from his po-
sition at his sisters feet and faced the
minister truculently

  shes not your sister he asserted
shrilly shes my sister and dont you
call her your sister

  the boy seated himself on the arm of his
sisters chair and placed a jealous arm
around her neck

  the reverend nittin gasped but man-
aged to bleat-

  no no my little man i did not mean
she was my sister except in the sweetness

of our mutual-

  say miss wayne blurted out the
blacksmith if that saddle hawse youre

figgerin on buvin needs shoein bring him
down and ill fit him up right

  i believe the man who is to have the
care of the horse will attend to that came
the cool reply

  the blacksmiths turgid mind had la-
bored long on the proposition of shoeing
her horse blacksmithing was all he knew
if she wasnt interested in horse-shoeing
the trail to her favor was closed to him
heavily he arose and clumped away

  nittins pallid soul shriveled under the
gamblers burning gaze he made a piti-
ful attempt to give his call the semblance
of sanity but the panic of a frightened
fawn hurried his feet as he murmured to
dora so pleased to have met you and
fairly skipped off the porch

  a huge bearded prospecter wandered in
saw the girl and stopped short then he
saw norn in the shadow and noted hardys
questioning hostile stare

  evenin hank greeted uncle charlie
set down my niece miss wayne

  the huge man removed his dusty hat
and gulped-

  pleased to meet you

  he seated himself carefully and regarded
the girl blandly

 oh the power of woman to stir the
imagination hank under the spell of
her beauty recounted tales of lost mines
and desperate days he told of lurching
across treeless hells and the visions that
then came to him of limpid pools and cool
streams gurgling among the grasses he
made gestures that any orator might envy
and his deep voice took on the melody of a
chant as he recited his odyssey

  dickie listened open-mouthed and the
girl smiled at the lads interest

 hank suddenly realized that he was
merely amusing the boy his egotism
collapsed this was no place for liim a
broken-down prospector who reeked of
greasewood smoke and burro-sweat

  he too arose heavily

  tliank him dora whispered to dickie
for telling you so many interesting
stories

  the big man gulped at dickies thank
you mr hank gave the girl a hopeless
look and stumbled into the darkness

  jed holly a smart deputy sheriff under
the thumb of hardy started to relate some
deeds of heroism giving himself a careless
air but the hardy glare made him falter
the survivor



and uncle charlies thundering laugh
blotted him out completely

  to hear you talk jed boomed the
merciless old man a mand think you had
a private buryin-ground

  jed likes to see his voice bounce
sneered hardy

  muttering vaguely the deputy retreated
from the ever-narrowing circle

one of norns cowboys who had
had several drinks of cheering and
ego-inflating liquor caught the gleam
oi the girls white dress and paused in
front of the hotel entranced by the beauty
of her face he did not see norn in the
shadowy corner with chaps flapping
spurs jingling and six-shooter dangling
he strode up on the porch

  hows old uncle charlie he cried
boisterously

  dan

  the cowboy whirled as though a gun
had been fired at him

  oh its you he bleated foolishly as
he recognized norn

  youre drunk said norn in a low
voicc move along

  the cowboy slunk away

  you keep your riders well in hand
king complimented uncle charlie

  then john meeker the jolly rotund
keeper of the general store joined the
circle on the porch he had hurried to his
self-appointed tryst the light through
the office window gleamed upon his head
as innocent of hair as the ivory handle of
norns six-shooter

  uncle charlie could not resist the temp-
tation

  jumpin bull-frogs but youre gettin
balder every minute meeker

  the old man ran his fingers through his
own thick gray thatch and chuckled

  now the storekeeper was most sensitive
concerning the nudity of his dome for
him uncle charlies cruel remark carried
little poisoned insinuations that he was
passe and had no place among young and
vigorous men worshiping at the shrine of
beauty and he had put on a clean collar
and sprayed himself liberally with some of
his best perfume

  uncle charlie sniffed

  and youre all perfumed up too
whats this world a-comin to

  the old man emitted a bellow of wild

laughter even the girl smiled hardy
too relaxed his rather tense pose and gazed
at the storekeeper with amused half-
closed eyes

  meeker weakly attempted jocularity but
displayed a pitiful lack of his wonted snap
perhaps hemper was right he was old-
fifty-two last fall

  but he managed to mumble to uncle
charlie-

  i just dropped down to tell you that i
got them canned pears you was askin for
the other day

  then he wandered off the porch and
paused irresolutely on the sidewalk

  better come back and get your hat
uncle charlie called

  meeker started as from a trance then
returned and secured his hat

  whats ailin you john the landlord
twitted all het up and excited and for-
gettin your hat without a hat-why
youre plum naked

  the little mans only thought now was
to escape wildly he looked back -s he
started down the steps missed his fooling
and fell floundering about on the sidewalk

  dickie with the thoughtlessness of the
very young laughed shrilly uncle char-
lie made no effort to restrain his mirth

  the storekeeper was badly bruised
norn leaped down and helped him to his
feet in his fiounderings meeker had shed
some toilet articles a pocket comb a tooth-
brush a mirror as well as sundry keys
pencils and other articles necessary to a
man of his trade-rat habits these norn
gathered up and stuck in the pockets of the
bewildered man then aiming him in the
desired direction he gave the little man a
gentle shove meeker zigzagged toward
his store with the halting steps of a sleep-
walker

  gritting his teeth on a persistent grin
norn returned to his dark corner

  mrs milliken the nurse came and
bundled dickie off to bed

  presently uncle charlie yawned por-
tentiously and retired leaving the big
office lamp burning for the benefit of those
he called the night owls

  the girl moved her chair over to the rail
and looked out through the cottonwoods
into the mysterious country beyond

  norn saw a prospector across the street
whom he had grub-staked and walked
over to chat with him


adventure

  brown the persistent moved his chair to
a position opposite the girl and settled
down for a cosy tete-a-tete

  the girl turned her head with a little
gesture of weariness

  brown began babbling of riding horses
and of mountain scenery the girl raised
a silencing hand

  i prefer to be alone she said

  there was no acidity in her tones just
weariness she was tired of the g
holden browns she had known droves of
them

  but i assure you miss wayne-

  the girl arose and walked away from
him and off the porch brown looked
after her half-minded to follow but
hardys chill voice knifed that thought

  does it take a piece of lead before you
know youre not wanted

  browns reply made hardy stare at him
in wonderment what queer words the
fat man released

  your insinuations are uncalled for
saii jj--loftily

tltough brown had seen uncle charlie
in action and had noted the swift punish-
ment of bundy his hot-house egotism
blinded him to the fact that he was not in
a country policed and guarded where a
man might make cutting remarks and es-
cape physical injury he had come from
the east as the representative of a well-
organized band of land-sharks who re-
garded california with its confusion in
land and water titles a rich field for their
questionable operations he believed that
a man could do anything so long as he kept
within the law his mind was not con-
structed for noting primitive facts the
law would always protect him he did
not know that his reply to the gamblers
question was like the prattle of a child
playing with a rattlesnake

  i dont get your line of talk hardy
said after darkly studying the fat man for
several moments but i wouldnt make
any false moves around this camp if i was
you somebody might open you

  the man was getting personal again
thought brown happily unaware that the
hardy expression somebody might open
you meant quick merciless knife-work
he decided not to bandy words with a low
gambler and marched swiftly past hardy
and up to his room

  queer bird mused the gambler aloud

then to twill-what you and the fat
slug so thick about

  hes interested in the resources of the
country twill replied unctuously for he
feared hardy

  uh huh muttered the gambler

twill was thankful when the girl
returned to her chair by the porch
rail and freed him from the gam-
blers somber questioning gaze the law-
yer slipped up to browns room having
some unfinished business with that gentle-
man

  brown opened the door and yawned in
the lawyers face

  i thought wed better go over that
matter more carefully said twill with a
deaths-head smirk and edging past brown
into the room

  he popped a finger to get into action
norn has never thought it necessary to
file on the water besides as ive told you
the stream heads beyond the northern
boundaries of the old mexican grant se-
cured by norns father

  thats the one point that bothers me
brown admitted what maps ive had
access to show the water heading outside
the grant but there has been no govern-
ment survey of that country the old
mexican grant boundaries were designated
by natural objects hills and such tilings
and are very unsatisfactory from a legal
standpoint you say you have been over
the norn ranch and know the boundaries
yes yes lied the lawyer glibly his
mind intent on the fee brown had promised

  he was in desperate need of money and
was as devoid of conscience as a famished
dog

  well brown decided ill see for
myself what do you suppose norn will
do when he finds i have secured control of
the water

  twill licked his lips nervously and at-
tacked the main issue

  i have had some financial difficulties
he nimbly sidestepped could you see
your way clear to advance me say a hun-
dred dollars

  following twills departure hardy de-
cided to show his hand he seated himself
on the rail near the girl and began

  miss dora im used to speakin my
mind the girl stirred uneasily im
not a poor man i may not have as much
the survivor



money as some men but ive plenty
then in his ignorance of the type of woman
he was addressing he added impressively
and id marry you

  her reply held the tinkle of steel on ice

  you honor me i infer that you do
not usually make such a generous offer
but i have no interest in you or your
affairs mr hardy

  she arose and a little flicker of light
from the lamp in the office brought out the
carven beauty of her face a faint glimpse
of futility came to the dark-faced gambler
some realization that she was as far above
him as heaven itself

  as she turned to go she glanced back at
him impersonally

  it came to hardy that he was only one
of the many who had shattered their hopes
on the rock of her indifference he wanted
to strangle her but her cool impersonal
gaze held him motionless he watched
her enter the office and then fled cursing
madly

  returning to the plotters up-stairs
twills request for cash made brown wince
the lawyer had been of considerable value
to him but there was a predatory gleam in
the funereal ones eye that the fat man did
not like he put him off with many
questions but insistently the lawyer re-
turned to the main issue

  a hundred dollars is most necessary to
my welfare at this time was the burden
of the lawyers refrain

  finally the land-shark sighed resignedly
and removed a fat billbook from his coat
hanging on the bedpost he counted out
the money and passed the bills to the
lawyer then he yawned meaningly

  twill opened the door and stood there
for a moment there was a tiny lamp
burning in the hall but the lawyer failed
o see the dark little figure approaching
him maria saw the lawyer in the door-
way and paused back of him in the shadow
she was not eavesdropping it was just her
shy indian way the man would go in a
moment and then she would slip down to
the cabin back of the kitchen to say good-
night to her mother before returning to her
little room adjoining the bedroom of her
mistress

  norn hasnt a shadow of a legal right
to the water asseverated the lawyer
having in mind the balance of his fee

  maria when she heard the name of the

man she adored became tense and alert
she did not gather the full import of twills
words but she felt intuitively that the man
in the doorway meant no good toward the
man who had brought her the mocking-bird

  brown grunted a sleepy good-night
twill slipped stealthily down the hall
passing dora on the stairway

norn had returned to the porch
and as the lawyer shambled past
him he groped for the cause of
twills nocturnal habits what had the
lawyer been doing up-stairs

  then from the end of the porch a soft
voice hailed him he smiled as the light
fell on the brown earnest face of maria

  he sauntered over to her

  well little brown one what can i do
for you

  me come tell you twill him talk wiz
big fat man in room twill him say-
and she parroted the lawyers words-
 norn hasnt shadow legal right to water
me come down fast back stairs -then in
spanish the words were not good worcfs 

  she smiled up at him adoringly norn
seated himself on the rail and put his arm
about the girls shoulder he meant noth-
ing by the caress other than a simple ap-
preciation of the loyalty of a child she
was his friend

  as dora entered her room she missed
her scarf and called maria meeting with
no response she decided to return to the
porch doubtless she had dropped the scarf
there she was not sleepy and was half-
inclined to take another stroll

  softly she opened the office door and
glided out on the porch she halted
abruptly as she recognized norn and
maria and noted the position of his arm
and the indian girls adoration then as
she realized that it hurt her strangely to
see his arm about the girl she fled to the
bleak heights of puritanism norn the
wealthy cattleman was playing with a
simple indian girl the man was a beast
-and worse since he knew the tenets of
decent society

  maria was looking up in the face of the
pondering man with intense and worship-
ful earnestness

  ill never forget what you have done
for me maria he said slowly

  doras heart contracted in a spasm of
pain-pain for the trusting indian maid


adventure

but he would forget what the girl had done
for him a man always forgets

  then maria lowered her eyes and met
the cold accusing gaze of her mistress
she did not know that that cold accusing
gaze was for norn and she fled precipi-
tately to her parents cabin not daring to
return to her room dreading the mysterious
anger of the beautiful white woman

  pardon me for interrupting but i
dropped my scarf-

  norn faced her puzzedly what cause
had she to address him with such accen-
tuated hauteur

  he found the scarf and gave it to her
she thanked him coldly

  amusing yourself with a simple child
she heard herself say is hardly the part
of a man who pretends chivalry-

  norn raised his hand in a sharp quick
gesture and for the life of her she could not
go on neither could she meet his search-
ing gaze she had expected to see him
cower before the flame of her sarcasm
instead hejadiated an anger that appalled

  look at me

  his tone was like the whisper of a swift
sword

  slowly she raised her eyes the mans
face was granite in his eyes were dancing
points of light his lips were thin-drawn
and about the nostrils were shadows that
flowed up to merge with the shadows be-
neath the eyes giving his face the look of
a portrait done boldly in black and white

  fear came to her not physical fear but
the keen spiritual fear that leaves the soul
quaking with dread

  what had she said oh yes the man
was guilty of an offense against the rules
of decent society

  norn whirled abruptly and strode into
the darkness

  she sank into a chair struggling to re-
tain her foothold on the peak of puritan-
ism she would rescue maria lift her up
tenderly from the depths   but the mans
eyes-those frank terrible eyes perhaps
he wasnt guilty that tiny thought gave
her an unreasonable joy then back to the
bleak heights he was guilty had he not
voiced the ancient lying litany ill never
forget

  wearily she returned to her room sigh-
ing under an imagined burden of respon-
sibility she would rescue maria the

poor blind foolish child and treat the
man with silent contempt yet she was
forced to admit it would be difficult to
treat with silent contempt a man who
steadfastly refrained from entering the
trap of words to be treated with silent
contempt a man must intrude she could
not recall the slightest intrusion on norns
part then she realized that she was not
thinking clearly that one set of vague
thoughts were battling another set equally
vague and that she was very sleepy

  an hour later norn entered his room
and drew off his boots he was calm now
recognizing that his position was impreg-
nable she had judged him who was guilt-
less on flimsy circumstantial evidence
in time she would discover the wrong she
had done him and being what she was
would have to come to him to right that
wrong that would mean no small struggle
on her part and in the meantime she would
be thinking of him he would make no
move toward her speak no word he
would hold himself aloof confining himself
to action in the man-life

  there was g holden brown with his
water - grabbing scheme well brown
knew something of the value of water but
his education in that line was incomplete
it might be well to add to the fat mans
knowledge a more intimate understanding
of the preciousness of the fluid he smiled
peacefully as he fell asleep

chapter v

bundys camp at the foot of
witch-talk was sheltered from the
west wind that frequently howled
through the pass and was an eye-gladden-
ing spot to men coming in from the desert
wastes at the head of the canon at the
mouth of which was the camp a waterfall
effectually barred the way the stream
ended in a pool near the camp about the
pool wild grass grew luxuriantly and alder
trees offered shade and shelter

  the gang was full-fed having just gorged
on roast mountain sheep flavored with bacon
they were smoking and lounging about the
fire bundy lowered in the shadow sore in
heart and body

  while they were eating the members of
the gang had given bundy a short rest from
their cruel gibes concerning his lady-killing
powers and his marvelous fighting ability
the survivor

 

but now as they lounged about the fire
they resumed their prodding of their ex-
chief for pete had not omitted informing
them that hardy had told him to look
after things

  bundy overlooked a bet one declared
fislung for a laugh hes got a good pair
of legs and should have let norn take after
him then all hed had to do was to run
norn to death

  another suggested that bundy should
have dug a hole and pulled the hole in
after him and thus compelled norn to
work himself to death diggin him
out

  wonder what he was lookin for when
you found him pete a hawk-nosed hu-
morist asked innocently you said he
was down on all fours lookin around for
something

  tryin to find his courage-

  here here reproved pete now realiz-
ing that there was nothing to be gained by
rubbing salt into the wounds of bundy
let up bundys not the only one that
lost out with a girl

  yes thats right agreed the hawk-
nosed humorist billy there got a pan of
dish-water and a dose of hot grease for his
trouble

  pete laughed the indian was of little
or no value he now saw it would be poor
policy to antagonize bundy to the extent of
forcing him out of the gang he half-re-
gretted that he had not been more diplo-
matic in his treatment of the fallen chief
therefore his attempt to divert the fire of
caustic comment to the indian

  he proceeded to encourage them in the
bantei- j of billy snake who as he became
the targe for their gibes drew back sul-
lenly into the darkness

  yes he drawled billy sure has hard
luck winnin a squaw he knows that an
injun who cant get a squaw is no man a-
tall

  he finished with a loud raucous laugh
the hawk-nosed humorist twisted around
lazily and taunted

  hey billy youll be an old man before
you get a squaw whats the matter with
you-no good guess old changs got you
scared out

  their words bit deep into the savage
heart of billy snake so they thought he
was not a man because he couldnt get a
squaw and the yellow man had thrown

hot grease on him as a squaw throws rub-
bish on an intruding dog aye and the
squaw had dishonored him with filthy wa-
ter well he would prove to them all that
he was a warrior-a man who could get a
squaw

  discouraged by the indians silence the
gang left off chaffing him and returned to
the subject of bundys various weaknesses
taunting him despite petes grumbled ob-
jections until they rolled up in their
blankets

  when the last man was asleep including
the bruised and battered bundy who
groaned even in slumber the indian ex-
amined his rifle and slipped from the camp
he ran as swiftly as a coyote and three
hours before dawn stood among the cotton-
woods near the hemper house then like
a shadow he glided across the yard and
paused near the door of the indians cabin
listening intently softly he opened the
door the cage that held marias mocking
bird hung near the window billy snake
fumbled with the tiny door of-cage
presently he wormed in a slim handicmid
the bird and squeezed its life out

  his next move was to clutch the throat
of maria lest as she awoke her screams
rouse the white men the girl opened her
eyes as the lean fingers dug into her soft
neck her forlorn sob was cut short by the
tightening of the implacable fingers

  silence hissed the indian in spanish
the snake hath come for thee

  he punched her with his rifle threatening
her with death if she did not instantly obey
his orders she had lain down fully dressed
with the exception of her shoes and now
sat up on the edge of the bed shivering
with nameless terror billy stooped and
felt around for her shoes and placed them
in her trembling hands he jammed the
rifle-barrel against her breast she drew
on her shoes choking back the sobs that
reached her

  billy snake seized the girls arm and
dragged her to the door at that moment
marias father awoke and gave a startled
yell which roused the mother who immedi-
ately began screeching the desperate
savage dragged the girl back with him and
with venomous threats of death silenced the
old indians to quaking hummocks of flesh
beneath the bed covers

  then jerking the girl through the door-
way he punched her viciously with his


adventure

rifle and drove her ahead of him into the
night

  the indian and-his captive were far be-
yond the precints of hemper ere marias
father ventured to pull back the covers
from his face the fat old ivawia was not
made of warrior stuff being reduced by the
missions and civilization to a soft blubber
that dreaded the hiss of steel or the whine
of lead sucking in his breath noisily he
slowly turned his head and peered dread-
fully about the cabin then he touched
his mammoth squaw who lay in a dumb
sweating trance of fear

  snake has taken our child he bubbled
in kawia

  the squaw sprang from the bed with
startling swiftness and began running
wildly about the room screeching and wail-
ing the old indian added his vocal efforts
to those of the distracted mother and the
little cabin became a bedlam of yelps howls
and screeches

  norn ever a light sleeper awoke lis-
tener for n moment to the caterwauling is-
stfihfllioni the cabin and dressed hurriedly
he threw up the window which overlooked
the roof of the kitchen crawled through
slipped down the roof and dropped to the
ground

  out of the various yelps and screeches
emitted by the frantic indians norn man-
aged to gather that billy snake had
abducted maria he wasted no time in
soothing the distracted parents but raced
to the stable saddled his horse made sure
his arms and ammunition were in fit condi-
tion and racked warily into the desert

  uncle charlie was aroused by the clamor
of the indians and managed to calm
marias father sufficiently to get the facts
he noted the lifeless mocking bird and his
old mouth twisted wickedly

  an injun trick he muttered and re-
turned to tire hotel to array himself for the
trail

dora had been awakened by the
outcries of the indians but dickie
slept through it all she put on a
robe and hurried down-stairs where she
met her uncle

  billy snake that piute that chang
throwed the grease on has stole maria the
old man yelled before she could question
him killed her mocker too the red
hound

  why what does it mean she quav-
ered

  it means roared the old man impati-
ently as he clawed about for his shoes
that maria is started on the first lap of the
trail to hell

  what is to be done she gasped
done grunted uncle charlie tugging
at his shoes kill the injun or get him
and hang him then he cursed viciously
as a shoe lace broke

  why uncle gasped the shocked girl

   why uncle- bawled the now-

frantic old man is this a time for a
niece of mine to be namby-pamby gawd
help you girl with your pin-headed idees
go get my rifle limpin sufferin judas
where in the good dangnation did i put
them six-shooter shells

  dora found herself dragging the heavy
rifle from its corner she returned to her
uncle humble and wanting to be of service
he was going forth to trail down a desper-
ate savage

  norns already gone fumed the old
man struggling with a refractory belt
nornll get that injun if hes to be got
maria has been under that boys wing since
she was a baby regler big brother to her
-figgerin on sendin her east to school
now give me that gun

  g holden brown came to the foot of the
stairs

  hey you brown yelled uncle char-
lie as he came from his room in full war-
gear youd better come to the hardware
store with me and get a rifle billy snakes
stole maria and well need plenty of men
well really mr hemper suck

work-

  all right if your feet are cold uncle
charlie cut in wickedly stay iu lied and
keep em warm

  the old warrior waddled forth to gather
up a posse

  brown rolled into bed and tucked the
covers about him snugly the abduction
of an indian squaw was nothing to him
indians were mere animals anyway then
he remembered that he had not locked his
door he arose lighted the lamp and fum-
bled for the key it came to him that the
guest rooms of the hemper house were
destitute of keys and he placed a chair
against the door not that he was fearful
oh no he simply felt that doors were made
to be locked
the survivor



  gloomy specters arose in the mind of
dora to point accusing fingers at her cring-
ing puritanism and to mock the narrow-
mindedness that had hastened her sarcastic
and unsubstantiated condemnation of norn
now she knew the man was guiltless being
merely a friend and protector of the indian
girl even now he was risking his life to
save the little brown maid then the spec-
ters gibbered she was largely responsible
for marias plight her accusing look
meant for norn had frightened the shy
maria into sleeping in the cabin instead of
seeking her little room where she would
have been beyond the reach of the savage

  what must norn now think of her she
who had looked out calmly on the world of
men noting impersonally their struttings
their tricks their solemn buffoonery had
proved to be without wisdom considera-
tion or even that fine intuition supposed to
be womans peculiar quality

  there was only one path to follow the
way of humbleness she would at the first
opportunity explain all to him leaving
nothing unsaid however much it hurt her
pride or thorned her womans dignity

  as for maria she would pray for her-
what else was there to do and if-
what concentrated sorrow and suffering
that little word held-if norn rescued the
child she dora wayne would vie with him
in making smooth the path of maria the
indian girl would be educated and given
every advantage

  then helplessly she contemplated the
fact that all her humbleness all her good
resolves were due to the staggering blow
her faulty judgment had received she
was not naturally considerate or good
mercilessly she lashed herself she had
only a superficial knowledge of life she
had been a snob condemning snobs an
egotist condemning egotists oh what
must norn the cold-eyed and silent man
think of her

  she found that she could not sleep so
she woke dickie and told him of the
abduction of maria

  i wish i were a man-i just wish i
were he whimpered wagging his head
savagely id take a gun and bring
maria back to you i bet mr norn will
make that old indian feel sorry did
uncle charlie go too

  yes dear

  and mr brown

  no laddie mr brown was afraid
yes sneered dickie the courageous
hes too fat

  the girl smiled wanly thankful for the
dauntless soul in dickies weak little body

  mr norn will make that old indian feel
sorry dickie repeated solemnly

  norn thought the girl always norn
she bowed humbly before the god of action
norn did not talk he acted all thought
all word juggling all opinion-launching
were as so much gray dust before vibrant
glowing action king norn was action
personified even dickie could see that
the man was ever in motion not to be
halted not to be stayed this to her
seemed touched with dim shadow sup-
pose some woman should love him could
she-could she hold him

  suddenly she threw her arms about the
wondering dickie and hugged him close
the lad made a clumsy effort to soothe her

  dont worry sweet little sister he
comforted smoothing her hair mr norn

will bring maria back to you

  and so they waited for the dawh

norn knew that billy snake
would not take maria to any resort
of the bundy gang an indian
who steals a woman puts not his trust in
white men

  the indian might hold to the witch-talk
side of the pass and venture across the
basin to the desert hills or he might round
the shoulder of rain-maker and cross to
the hills in the vicinity of his-norns-
ranch

  norn decided to keep to the witch-talk
side until he came to the jutting crags that
protected the bundy camp reaching the
crags he would then ride back toward his
ranch by that time it would be light
enough for trailing meanwhile he must
face the chance of a shot from billy snake

  dawn found him swinging back toward
his ranch convinced that the indian had
kept to the rain-maker side of the basin
he struck the trail where maria and the
indian had crossed the ranch road and
headed scross the basin toward twenty-
eight palms a water-hole about four miles
from the desert hills he dismounted and
closely examined the tracks maria was
ahead billy was evidently driving her
her tracks were little troughs in the sand
indicating fatigue the indians tracks


adventure

were clean-cut he was not beginning to
tire and was yet able to travel many long
hot miles

  the rancher followed the trail with great
caution he knew the indian trick of
doubling back to ambush a pursuer

  at twenty-eight palms he found some
remnants of rabbit fur and skin the
indian to save ammunition had clubbed
a cottontail and eaten it raw billy snake
had one meal the better of it but that did
not matter

  norn resolved to turn his horse loose
billy was now probably snugly ensconced
in some safe look-out in the hills some
point of vantage from which he would be
able to sight the pinto horse at a sufficient
distance to cover trail or plan ambush
true the indian could see a man on foot
but not at the distance he could discern
the horse the pinto could find grass and
water near the palms lastly a horse was
practically useless in following a man on
foot through the desert hills

  as norn followed the trail toward the
the country became more desolate
great washes strewn with boulders de-
bouched from the hills here and there
barrel cactuses lifted hairy shapes that
seemed instinct with hideous intelligence
between the washes swarmed the cholla
green and flourishing drawing from some
mysterious source a vitality that mocked
the less-favored growths dead and withered
in that sun-baked waterless land

  the trail of billy snake led into one of
the gloomy canons that extended rib-wise
from the back of the desert range that
gradually rose to merge with rain-maker

  norn paused and considered the ways
of indians would billy follow the canon
he had entered and cross the back of the
range or would he cross over to the canon
on the south certainly the indian would
not turn toward rain-maker had he
intended to hide in the fastnesses of the
timbered mountain the indian would have
headed straight toward the peak he
concluded that billy snake would do the
most baffling thing follow the canon for
a short distance then turn up a rocky
tributary and cross over to an equally
rocky tributary to the canon on the south

  the rancher resolved to enter the south
canon and keep close to the north wall
if billy had not crossed over he would
follow the canon up to the back of the range

and turning north strike the indians
trail

  billy had done what norn had surmised
the indian had turned south up a tribu-
tary canon stepping carefully from boulder
to boulder forcing the girl to imitate his
trail-trickery as they reached the head of
the tributary billy halted and peered over
a shrub at the desert basin below him he
hissed a sibilant warning to the girl as he
glimpsed a man approaching the mouth of
the big canon to the south

  long he studied the approaching figure
noting a certain familiarity in the carriage
and dress then as the man entered the
canon the indian recognized him so the
mocking-bird-giver thought to wrest the
woman from him billys lips drew back
from his white teeth now was his oppor-
tunity to count as was the custom of his
fathers a mighty coup he had stolen a
woman from a hostile camp a deed which
the boldest warrior might recount with
pride now he would kill a white man
and give to himself the honors of a chief

  norn he mocked his victim seeks
the mocking bird that she may sing for
him but lo-and he patted his rifle-
this shall sing him to sleep

  the girl gave him a look of deathless hate
and then her tear-streaked face grew dull
void alike of hope or despair

  as norn disappeared in the mouth of the
canon billy snake punched the girl with
his rifle her skirt was in rags where it
had caught on cactus and mesquite her
back was a mass of bruises where he had
punched her with his rifle her waist was
tom from her shoulders and there were
marks as of claws on her breasts she had
passed through enough torture to kill a
white woman yet despoiled bruised and
bloody and hopeless she plodded on

  the floods had wedged in several huge
boulders at the mouth of the tributary
canon where billy hoped to ambush norn
the main canon smooth-walled turned
some twenty paces beyond the boulder-
clogged mouth of the tributary the
white man for that distance would be at a
distinct disadvantage

  the indian traveling a more direct route
than norn reached the mouth of the
tributary several minutes before the white
man hugging the north wall came to the
abrupt turn here norn halted recog-
nizing the turn as an ideal place for an
the survivor

 

ambush yet he must go forward
crouching low his rifle at the ready he
leaped around the turn

  at that instant maria calling on the
last shred of her strength sprang over the
boulders and threw herself toward the
white man screaming

 norn norn norn

  billy snake in a mad frenzy raised up
and fired from the hip at the girl even
as she slumped norns rifle mingled its
withering crack with the bellow of billys
old springfield and before the echoes -died
the indian fell his head in plain sight of the
white man

  norn leaped over the boulders to make
sure the indian was not shamming death
and then sprang back to maria

  she was alive but she would soon tread
the way of souls norn lifted her up rest-
ing her head against his knee he did not
examine the wound her face told him she
was doomed

  the mocking bird looked up into the face
of the man she had loved ever since she was
a solemn-eyed baby

  aye she sighed in spanish thou
thought to save me yet soon shall the
mocking bird fly far away from thee

  he patted her cheek reassuringly

  no no little one thou hast but a
scratch or two soon norn will carry thee
back to the madre who awaits thee are
not the arms of norn strong arms

  his heart sank as his hand came in con-
tact with her warm welling blood

  though the shadow of death was begin-
ning to dull her face she yearned up to mm
whispering

  the beautiful white one was angry
with maria- she moaned a little then
wilt thou not tell me-thou lovest me-
thou grand man norn wilt thou not
kiss me

norn looked down in the face of
the dying girl and read therein
the age-old yearn of the loving
woman he had been blind to the flight
of time deeming her a child who would
never become a woman why should he
not now tell her he loved her which in
truth he did though not in the way her
womans soul desired

so he pressed his lips to hers murmuring
endearments saying over and over again-
norn loves thee little brown one

  she strained up for a last look at his face
and saw his eyes bright with tears love
transfigured her face he was mourning for
her

  then the shadow crept over her face
she breathed a faint adios her head
drooped and she was gone

  norn eased back the bruised little body
and stood for a time a motionless somber
lonely figure

  there was only one thing to do-carry
that which once had been the mocking bird
back to twenty-eight palms he could
leave billy to the coyotes but not little
brown one there was no place in that
canon where the little form would be safe
from the desert scavengers

  tenderly he raised the dead girl to his
shoulder and with considerable effort
picked up his rifle

  it was a ghastly journey straining his
strength to the utmost he was soon
forced to cache his rifle and belt with the
burden on his shoulder the cactus and
boulders the treacherous ratjioles all
seemed leagued against him he
frequently talking to the dead girl assuring
that which had once smiled shyly at him that
he would somehow overcome all obstacles

  when he reached twenty-eight palms
he was near the limit of his desert-seasoned
strength he eased his burden to the
ground the last lap of the journey had
been made without rest and the engine
of his being was pounding furiously

  exhausted he sprawled out on his back
and lay motionless for a full hour

  the sunset was now flaming in the pass
fiery crimson bars across a sky of smoky
purple

  the rancher arose and prepared a bed
of palm leaves for the dead girl and drew
off his shirt to cover the vacuous face

  again he sprawled out he would sleep
for a few hours and then on the back of
his faithful pinto carry maria home

  a posse headed by uncle charlie rode
up to the palms shortly before midnight
they had combed the witch-talk side of
the basin and had come to twenty-eight
palms planning to make that point a base
camp

  norn was awakened by the scraping of
mesquite against boots and stirrups and
the voices of the rather incautious man-
hunters he was on his feet as they rode
beneath the palms


adventure

  there was a pallid half-moon and uncle
charlies searching gaze fell on the form
resting on the palm-leaf bed

  the boy saved lier the old man
shouted jubilantly shes all safe and
sound there she is-asleep

  yes said norn sadly shes asleep-
forever

  the men hurriedly dismounted and
gathered closely around norn bitter oaths
and furious exclamations broke from the
listeners as he reported the bald facts of the
affair in the canon

  well said uncle charlie as norncon-
cluded theres nothin left for us to do but
take maria home jack youd better get
kings rifle and belt we wont wait
for you

  at dawn the posse rode into hemper
marias father and mother were waiting in
front of the hotel to receive them

  as the mother saw the blanket-shrouded
shape in the arms of one of the horsemen
she slumped to the ground and lifted the
monrnintwflil fat pathetically ugly but
pwffhreress a heart-broken mother

  the father stolidly received the body of
his daughter and carried it into the cabin

  dora and dickie were on the porch
sorrowful spectators of the last act of the
tragedy

  uncle charlie hurriedly gave dora the
particulars of norns vain attempt to rescue
maria

   the girls eyes filled with tears as the old
man told of the tortures inflicted on the
indian girl and of her final sacrifice

  as uncle charlie concluded the account
norn who had been assisting marias
mother back to the cabin came up dora
tears gemming her dark lashes made an
impulsive move toward him contrite words
struggling to her trembling lips but the
man merely lifted his hat flashed her a cold
disconcerting glance and passed into the
office and up to his room

chapter vi

the man was always passing to and fro
swiftly she gave him many opportunities
to approach her and even resorted to the
ancient artifice of dropping her hand-
kerchief but to no avail norn merely
recovered the handkerchief for her and
passed on swiftly

  she saw him talking with men here and
there she saw him emerge from the barber-
shop freshly shaven and shorn she saw
him laughing at some story a grinning
desert-rat related but never once did he
turn his eyes toward her

  dickie however experienced no difficulty
in halting norn and worming from him an
invitation to visit the ranch in the lap of
rain-maker it seemed that any one but
she could attract and hold his attention
even brown was able to talk with the
restless man and receive an invitation to
look over the ranch

  she saw dickies face grow cloudy with
disappointment as brown hurried into the
hotel to prepare for the trip

  then she heard norn comforting the
boy with-

  you can go with me later-probably
next week

  despite her blind struggles against it
she was conscious of a growing admiration
for the mans indifference she was per-
fectly aware of the fact that men frequently
affected indifference to attract feminine
attention but this man was not acting
she had falsely accused him and he had
risked his life in a vain attempt to save the
indian girl she had so smugly planned to
rescue from his clutches certainly he
had a right to be indifferent to even look
on her with contempt to regard her as a
narrow-minded woman with no vision no
understanding of the good and true and
last of all to brand her a hopeless egotist
little wonder he ignored her existence

  desert jack norns foreman drove up
brown came up wearing a linen duster and
carrying a small grip as the men settled
themselves in the mountain wagon the
girl felt the prospect of dreary days of self-
reproach impel her to rush out and force
norn to listen to her but ere she could
move desert jack yelled at the dancing
ponies and they were on their way with
brown in the back seat frantically clutching
at his hat

  before they were out of the pass brown
concluded that the driver was a demon

in the days following the funeral
of maria dora saw norn fre-
quently but she was unable to
summon sufficient strength to penetrate
his reserve had he given her the oppor-
tunity demanded by her training and pride
she would have humbly asked his forgive-
ness for her puritanical outburst but
the survivor



who had no regard for human life norn
seemed to take the driving of his foreman
as a matter unworthy of attention the
ponies dashed around the shoulder of rain-
maker the wagon swaying drunkenly on
the edge of a sheer cliff the two friends
in the front seat conversed casually while
the light wagon skirted the edge of doom

  get into the collar there you roan
loafer desert jack yelled what in
sam hill do you think this is-a funeral
move there you black hawse what are
yeh-a tree

  and this on the crest of a steep incline
down which they raced like an insane
meteor

  when they reached the ranch brown
almost fell from the wagon he was
deliriously glad to get his feet on good
firm ground

  the land-shark could hardly believe his
eyes when his host ushered him into the
big living-room of the ranch-house there
were big easy chairs pictures and books
piano and a fireplace built of selected
boulders

  norn called a chinese servant who served
the fat man with several drinks of excellent
whisky

  and over the dinner brown could have
offered up prayerful thanks salad fried
chicken a gravy par excellence big red
strawberries and cold rich cream

  the dining-room was rich furnished
there was a touch of the medieval in the
beamed ceiling and the heavy high-backed
chairs norn with a white-garbed chinese
at his back held the quiet dignity of a
feudal lord forced through a twist of
circumstance to entertain some grubbing
commoner

  as the meal progressed browns en-
thusiasm rose to glorious heights

  a miracle he declaimed a miracle
out of desolation into green fields great
trees and all the comforts of civilization
and water is the magician that has worked
this wonder i shall not rest until i look
over your ranch

  im afraid ill have to leave you for a
day or two norn said staring up at the
beamed ceiling meditatively ive a pros-
pect over at poisoned spring i must check
up a couple of men are working on it
ill return by way of what we call the ridge
trail and then down the mountain to the
ranch i dont imagine you would care to

take a night ride i prefer traveling at
night to escape the heat

  brown pondered for a few moments

  do you ride all night he asked loath
to leave the comfortable ranch-house

  no no i take a pack-horse and camp
at midnight

  well and the fat man smiled blandly
what do you say to my daring the wilds
with you

  norns reply was pleasant enough but
to brown eager to avail himself of the
opportunity to view the ranch boundaries
it seemed tinctured with reluctance

  just as you desire mr brown but i was
a little fearful that you would not care to
sleep out

  brown expanded his chest and waved his
hand carelessly

  life is full of ups and downs as i was
telling miss wayne the other day a man
of my nature is prepared to take things as
they come

  splendid philosophy norn com-
mended did miss wayne agree with
you

  quite although she is not a woman to
talk a great deal but in the main she
agrees with me a remarkable woman-
a remarkable woman ill warrant you
that she will be surprised though when i
tell her of my adventures in the wilds

  it must be quite a trial to her norn
said this rough country and the people
with whom she has nothing in common
yes it is brown agreed confidentially
really i dont know what she would do
were it not for me im a life-saver to her
mr norn a mental life-saver

  very fortunate indeed murmured
the rancher then abruptly well if
youve decided to go with me well start
shortly make yourself comfortable and
ill have the horses brought up to the
porch

  the rancher followed his guest into the
living-room

brown smiled as norn left him
everything was working out as he
desired they would take a little
canter go into a comfortable camp and
then swing around to the northern bound-
aries of the ranch there he would casually
ask questions concerning those boundaries
and ascertain beyond a doubt if the water
was open to filing he wandered out 


adventure

the porch noting with secret satisfaction
the great fields of alfalfa once in control
of the water all this would be his at his
own figures

  norn was giving desert jack some
instructions

  im taking the white-faced bay the
black mare and old jim we may swing
around the mountain and go into hemper
in any event you take the buckboard into
town in a couple of days and wait for me

  desert jack grunted assent he had
been with norn since the latter was a baby
and had long since learned never to ques-
tion his plans

  at twilight the horses were brought up
brown insisted on tying his little black
grip to the saddle they mounted and de-
scended into the desert basin to ride for
hours through an interminable gray waste

  at midnight they halted brown heard
the rancher stamping brush and then saw
a tiny flame lick out through the gloom

  they were in a sandy depression en-
circled by ifitsquite at the far edge of
the depression was a great clump of water-
weed out of which emerged norn

  too bad reported the rancher the
holes dry as a bone lucky weve a big
canteen of water

  he kicked some brush on the fire

  brown gave no thought to the dry water-
hole being fully occupied with his physical
discomforts he was stiff and sore from
the hard ride and wanted to lie down
already he was beginning to regret leaving
the ranch he secured his precious grip
and stood a big straddle-legged figure
helpless and soft as some brobdingnagian
baby

  nora proceeded to unburden the pack-
horse then he disappeared for a time
apparently picketing the horses return-
ing he tossed the helpless brown a blanket

  put that under you he said tersely
and look out for side-winders

  side-winders echoed the fat man

  yes rattlesnakes

  brown quivered like a stranded jellyfish
what an idiot he had been-what a thrice-
dashed idiot-to leave the ranch-house a
miserable camp and rattlesnakes what
sort of a man was this norn who could
lie down so calpily in such a frightful hole

  the rancher spread his blanket and lay
down to sleep

  brown spread his blanket out full length

and seated hmself in the center of it
the fire died down and the gloom closed in
on the ghastly depression vainly the
snake-shy man attempted to sleep dur-
ing his shuddering watches he often thought
of starting a fire but was afraid to leave the
imagined safety of the blanket

  cheerfully norn greeted the hollow-eyed
wretch at dawn browns clothes were
wrinkled and rumpled with his sleepless
flounderings

  get a good rest asked the rancher
stretching his arms and arching his chest

  brown stared at him pathetically

  its all in getting used to it norn called
back as he disappeared in the mesquite

  presently the rancher sauntered back

  guess well have to do a little walking
he said carelessly horses got away

  what brown almost screamed

  nothing to worry about norn assured
him were both strong and healthy
we can walk over to my prospect in jig
time may have to camp another night
though

  but i did not anticipate a situation like
this brown whined

   life is full of ups and downs as you
told miss wayne norn reminded him

  the little camp was now flooded with
sunshine brown stood back from the fire
while norn cooked the breakfast the
heat gave the fat man a slight nausea

  they ate in silence the desert cruel
and implacable had stripped brown of his
affability and aplomb norn seemed con-
centrated on some vital inner thought

  the rancher proceeded to hang the
saddles up in the mesquite and to cache
the camp impedimenta they could not take
with them

  how far will we have to walk brown
whined as norn gave him the canteen to
carry

  oh i dont know the exact distance
we ought to reach poisoned spring some
time tonight

  the rancher led the way toward the
barren hills brown lurched after him
burdened with the little black grip and the
big canteen

  the desert now to the fat man was a
cauldron norn made no objections to his
guests frequent pulls at the canteen
brown found his weight of soft flesh be-
coming a burden that bore him remorse-
lessly earthward he removed his coat
the survivor

i

and collar and finally his shirt the sun
soon blistered his soft fat neck norn
swung on like a tireless demon

  slow up a bit the fat man finally
gasped

  well have to keep moving came the
merciless reply we cant lose time or
well be out another day

  brown was pouring the water down his
throat when a lean hand took the canteen
from him

  youre drinking too much for your own
good the rancher reproved ill carry
the canteen

  noon and a pitiless sun that made
browns fat sizzle they paused for a
short rest brown clawed frantically for
the canteen but norn restrained him

  too much water is not too good for any
man said the rancher men new to the
desert are apt to get water-logged

  please mr norn brown begged in a
thin little voice one drink i can scarcely
breathe

  help yourself then if you feel that
bad

  norn passed him the canteen

  no drunkard with every nerve screaming
for alcohol ever pulled a stopper with
greater haste than brown unscrewed the
l op of the canteen he drank steadily as a
child nurses a bottle

  has it ever occurred to you that i might
need a little of that water norn asked
though he had not even moistened his lips
since leaving the camp

  oh thats good brown was mumbling
ecstatically

  utterly immersed in self he did not hear
norns rather sardonic question

  the rancher smiled and took the canteen
browns eyes followed it lovingly

  norn resumed the march brown fol-
lowed because he wanted to keep near the
canteen

e they failed to reach norns mys-
terious prospect that night norn
built a fire and fried some bacon
brown lay groaning oblivious to the
menace of rattlesnakes for once he was
footsore his lips were swollen and cracked
and every nerve quivered with the frightful
exertion he had made norn passed him a
piece of bread and a rasher of bacon

  the sun behind bars of crimson and gold
and pale lemon sank into the sea beyond the

pass where squatted hemper twilight
settled on uie ashen desert hills

  well go on to the prospect tomorrow
norn planned as he ate his bacon and
bread well have to walk back if we
dont catch a freight outfit of course
if you dont want to go on you can return
to my place its only twenty-five or
thirty miles from here you should be
able to make it without water i have
walked it several times without food or
water by going a little out of your way
you could reach twenty-eight palms about
noon theres water there

  brown made no reply convinced now
that the man was insane the fool was
intent on reaching some mysterious point
in this god-forsaken land and for no good

reason a gold prospect- what did

the demon want with a gold prospect when
he already had a million-dollar ranch to
follow the insane creature would mean an-
other day of torture

  disconsolate and sodden-faced brown
waited until convinced thjtnorn was
asleep then his face brightened with a
cunning smile and he surreptitiously se-
cured the canteen the gug-gug of the
water was music to his ears when he
could drink no more he lowered the canteen
and looked down spitefully at his calmly
sleeping host

  norn had said that the mountains were
only twenty-five or thirty miles distant
that meant that twenty-eight palms lay
not more than a dozen miles from their
present camp he could walk it before
dawn rest in the shade of the palms
saturate himself with water and in the
cool of the night return to hemper which
he vaguely imagined lay somewhere be-
tween the two peaks

  a deformed moon was coming up over
the deserts edge and he could see the loom
of the peaks he would waken norn and
tell him of his decision no not that
norn was bent on retaining the canteen
then there was the matter of food what
arrangements had norn made for food
at the mysterious prospect doubtless he
had plenty of food and water there it
wouldnt hurt the rancher to go without
food and water for a day he was tough-
tough as rawhide he brown needed food
and water-especially water he would
explain to norn later-when he met him
in hemper it would be all right


adventure

  the miserable man was so intent on
escaping from the desert that all his land-
grabbing dreams had gone glimmering
he no longer thought of anything except
getting the fat body of g holden brown
where it would be protected from the
merciless sun and where it could fairly
wallow in water

  with infinite caution he secured what was
left of the bread and bacon and slung the
big canteen over his shoulder then he
picked up his grip and tiptoed from the
camp

  norn arose quietly glancing at the
star-strewn sky to get his bearings he
struck out in the direction brown had
taken

  brown stumbled along as best he could
at the camp he had soothed himself into
believing that his appropriation of the food
and water would meet with a careless smile
from norn now that he was actually
on his way he realized that he dreaded
facing the rancher but he must not think
of that w- -the all-important thing was to
readthemper-alive

  a point of panic glowed in some dark
recess of his mind he thought of the
north star and glanced up at the sky but
the sky was so thickly sown with stars that
he could not even distinguish the big
dipper his had not been a life of star-
gazing

  as he gazed at the sky his lightly-shod
foot struck a cactus agony intense and
keen followed he hopped about on one
foot whimpering and groaning then he
dropped his luggage and plumped down in
the sand to remove the tiny barbs they
came out of the cringing flesh with infinite
reluctance he was forced to set his light
jaws and jerk quickly

  when the last little barb had been jerked
out he was fairly dripping perspiration
for a time he sat motionless a rumpled
sweat-soaked manikin on the vast floor of
the desert

  he thought of time and took out his
watch and struck a match

  great heavens he chokingly exclaimed
its past midnight

  past midnight and no loom of palms to
mark a safe shelter from the merciless sun
that would soon rise to torture him

  he took a long pull at the canteen he
shook it and gasped as he noted how light
it was there came no heavy swing of

water only a light splash even as he
lowered the canteen something stirred
beneath his feet and he leaped back con-
vulsively dropping the canteen his blood
was chilled by the faint dry whirring
sound then he thought of the precious
water and fairly blubbered he lost no
time in striking a match for he was fearful
of picking up the canteen before making
sure that no gray rattler was within striking
distance the black stain of the wasted
water in the gray sand made him whimper
he snatched up the canteen miracle of
miracles there was a little water left

  the snake was buzzing in desultory
fashion brown after securing his grip
and the bacon and bread backed slowly
away from the menacing sound turned and
with mincing caution proceeded toward
witch-talk a dark spot or a piece of
vermiculated cactus stalk filled him with
sickening dread his light shoes and thin
stockings made him feel as though his
entire body were naked and defenseless

  two hours of wandering through the
gloom and no palms to gladden his aching
eyes he became conscious of a terrible
strain and suddenly gave way under it

  im lost he whimpered lost-lost

  then a comforting thought came to him
men traveled the desert at night he
would shout for help he raised his voice
in a cracked scream that seemed to profane
the holy silence norn heard that cracked
scream and smiled cynically

  brown listened until he heard the ooni
oom oom of his heart but there came no
answering shout again he whimpered-

  lost lost lost

  he wanted to drop down in the sand and
cry but the fear of snakes kept him erect

  as he staggered on he thought of dora
wayne she was doubtless sweetly sleep-
ing in the morning she would appear
on the hotel porch dressed in cool linen
she would sit there and calmly watch the
men of hemper what would she say if he
told her how he had escaped from the
desert-well he needed the water more than
norn norn was a hard man used to the
desert he made some attempt to picture
her welcoming him with soft sympathy
and bringing him water and bathing his
head but the picture was vague and un-
satisfactory

 then self-pity came to him norn
hadnt treated him fairly the rancher
the survivor



had dragged him out on an insane search
for some mythical prospect it was norns
fault that the horses had not been securely
picketed everything was norns fault
he would tell him so-when he saw him

  at last utterly fagged he resolved to
dare the snakes and rest he struck
several matches examined the ground
carefully and sank down breathing noisily
but he could not rest he felt that all the
creeping crawling things in the world were
headed toward him imagination rose like
some terrible jinnee toward dawn he
found himself shivering and began groping
for twigs with which to start a fire but
everything he touched presented im-
placable stickers and thorns and he moaned
and gave up that project

      the dawn was beautiful beyond

     compare in the east bloomed
jt banks of tender rose edged with
pale gold the air seemed to sparkle
with life but the man lurching to his
feet was oblivious to the ineffable glory
of the dawn his very soul slavered to
escape from the hades into which-and he
babbled in self-pity-it had been projected
through no fault of his own

  hen over the brow of the range of
ghastly hills rose the remorseless sun

  the man was appalled at the scene the
dawn disclosed gray interminable wastes
that reached to the ends of the world not
a house nor a human being in sight his
sight was not keen enough to note the
crouching figure in the wash a few rods to
his left

  the peaks seemed no nearer than they
had yesterday and there were no palms
waving gleaming green banners of welcome

  long before noon brown had drained the
canteen but he still clung to it as a sort of
mocking emblem of safety he had eaten
some of the bread and with difficulty
swallowed a piece of the raw bacon he
was afraid to stop even to broil a piece of
the bacon under the blazing sun panic
drove him forward he began to make
concessions if he reached hemper he
would not bother about norns ranch and
the water he would leave there   
but of the girl he attempted to vision
her marrying him and going to san fran-
cisco with him but the picture was blurred
but he could see himself entering a large
cool cafe in that city and having a respectful

waiter bring him an old-fashioned stein of
ice-cold beer he moaned as he thought
of the ice-cold beer

  the little grip was now a burden that
taxed his last shred of strength he halted
long enough to hide it securely as he sup-
posed in a clump of greasewood he made
no attempt to mark the spot but childishly
reasoned that he could later return in a
comfortable conveyance and secure the grip

  by noon he was within a few miles of
hemper his stomach was sagging like a
useless appendage and his tongue filled his
mouth like a dried sponge glittering
points of light stabbed his eyes his knees
trembled and his hands felt like bloated
sacks of blood

  norn salvaged the little black grip but
did not open it he followed the lurching
brown until he saw him disappear in the
grass and willows that lined an irrigation
ditch that purled across the road a half-
mile from the limits of hemper the fat
man was safe now and would remain for
some time at the ditch the raitchtt-paade
a little detour to avoid being seen by his
late guest and soon was seated on the steps
of the hemper house

  at his request uncle charlie hastened
to bring him a pitcher of water

  between sips norn told uncle charlie
of marias warning against brown and
twill and gave a humorous account of the
desert trip

  when he had finished uncle charlie went
up-stairs and brought down browns bag-
gage and set it out on the sidewalk

  theres no room in my house for a
sharper the old man declared grimly
as he returned to his chair good thing
though your land takes in all the water
or the fat hog might a caused you the
trouble of killing him instead of jes
runnin his fat off on the desert poor fool
he went by the old maps and didnt know of
the new survey what about twill

 i might speak to him norn said
softly

  just then a curious figure came in view
it weaved and wobbled like a scarecrow
suddenly imbued with life it gave vent
to weird sounds and lovingly patted a big
canteen it carried

  it came up on the sidewalk and then
as it saw norn stopped short and breathed
noisily through its nose like a frightened
horse


adventure

  how are you mr brown norn
greeted him kindly quite warm today
isnt it

  oh youre real-youre real screamed
brown staggering toward the rancher
god i thought-oh what did i think

  he started up the steps but uncle charlie
barred the way

  you cant come in here brown the
old man told him harshly set on the
sidewalk if you want id advise you to
take the stage out theres your baggage
out there

  brown dumb and fearful slowly re-
treated to the edge of the sidewalk and
dropped down

  abner twill came down the street and
noted the curious inert figure seated on
the walk when he recognized brown and
saw the cold gleam in norns eyes he
started to cross the street but norns com-
pelling voice halted him

  twill come here

  with the icy fingers of fear clutching his
heartrthe lawyer approached the rancher

  youre mixed up in some dirty work
norn accused and there was an expression
on his face that hinted of cold steel and
sudden death take the next stage out
twill could not quite lose sight of the law
and ventured to question-

  and if i remain mr norn

  youll not remain norn assured him
it was all too slow for uncle charlie
he must needs rush in and secure the old
sharpes

  ill take a hand here myself he
bawled twill when that stage comes-
theyre hitchin fresh hawses now-and
you dont board it youre a dead jackleg
ive always wanted to kill a lawyer

  the stage rattled up to the hotel uncle
charlie crossed his fat legs and rested the
old buffalo gun across his knee

  twill gulped looked around vainly for
some avenue of escape and then said some-
thing that stirred brown to groaning
action	u

  some grinning but mystified hemperites
tossed up browns baggage to the driver
but when an obliging youth came to the
little black grip he gave it too much power
the driver failed to catch it and it dropped
on the other side of the stage gapped open
and disgorged its contents the west
wind sweeping the streets of hemper
picked up sundry maps and legal papers

referring to the norn ranch and blew
them into weeds into cottonwood trees
and under the sidewalk the youth tossed
up the empty grip to the impatient
driver

  brown escorted by twill was too
exhausted to note the catastrophe that had
befallen his precious grip

  the lawyer helped his client into the
stage and stood for a moment debating the
feasibility of defying the two grim men on
the porch

  get in came the landlords warning
bellow and twill got in

  that makes this a pretty decent town
now said uncle charlie with a satisfied
air as the stage rattled away that ends
the jackleg and that ends brown

  yes norn pleasantly agreed thanks
to your persuasive powers that ends
brown but im out a good canteen he
took it with him

chapter vh

since that night dora wayne
had so coldly informed him of her
utter lack of interest in him or his
affairs chance hardys thoughts had trav-
eled many dark and devious trails but he
invariably returned to the fact of her in-
difference not only to him but to all men
rivalry would have stirred him to action
but her calm indifference to all had created
a democracy of unrequited loves this
baffled him there was no man against
whom he could proceed

  for a time especially following the van-
quishing of bundy hardy had regarded
norn suspiciously but as the days slipped
by and no words passed between the ranch-
er and the girl the gamblers suspicions
drew back into their subconscious lair

  with the passing of maria-the gambler
had declined to join uncle charlies posse
considering indians beneath his notice-
hardys suspicions had peered out only to
draw back before the fact of norns long
and friendly interest in the indian child
the rancher had not sought to impress
dora wayne with his prowess as an indian
fighter

  the brown episode might have caused
hardy to believe that norn had removed
the fat man because of the latters everlast-
ing dancing of attendance on the girl had
not a henchman brought the gambler one
the survivor



of the papers the little black grip had dis-
gorged the paper plainly indicated the
brown plot to secure by a legal twist the
water supply of the norn ranch

  hardy marveled at the mercy norn had
shown the fat schemer browns scare-
crow appearance following his visit to the
norn ranch and his abrupt departure from
hemper under the menace of uncle char-
lies sharpes evidenced a consideration on
norns part that was beyond the gambler
under like provocation hardy would have
killed brown with no more regret than old
chang accorded the beheading of a chicken
as it was the gambler had been tempted
several times to run the fat man out of town

  the gambler looked out moodily through
the barred window of his saloon he saw
norn on the porch of the hotel

  a stage barn-helper brought up a big
cream-colored horse and a black pony

  presently dora and dickie came out
the girl was attired in a riding-habit that
accentuated the gracious contours and lur-
ing curves of her perfect body her hair
hung in a thick dark braid and she wore a
cavalierish scarlet hat that sported a jew-
eled buckle

  dickie now beginning to show the bene-
ficial results of dry bracing air ran down
the steps and eagerly mounted his pony

  hardy noted that norn merely lifted his
hat to the girl a black flood of desire welled
up thickly within the gambler as he watched
her swing up and into the saddle from
where he stood he could discern the rose-
tint in her cheeks and the flash of her
white teeth she was radiant a flame of
womanliness that maddened him he must
possess her with face working and fists
clenched he turned from the window
there must be some way to force her to
come to him she would never love him
of that he was convinced but he would
dispense with sentiment if he could only
possess her yet there seemed to be no
way-she cared for nothing but and he
stopped short there was the boy she loved
him

  the gambler entered his little sanctum
and slowly seated himself a plan was
beginning to form in his mind-a dark and
desperate plan

  dora and dickie cantered down the desert
road

  as they descended the sharp slope of the
pass the cool air of the mountains gave way

to shimmering heat waves rising from the
desert basin

  we could have postponed our ride until
sundown the girl told her brother who
was for pressing on into the desert we
had better return now laddie

  as they turned their horses a lone rider
emerged from a great wash that lay a few
rods beyond them it was pete coming in
to discuss with hardy certain plans for a
wider range of activities and to fix more
firmly the chieftainship with which hardy
had so carelessly invested him

  bundy had been content to let hardy
plan the campaigns to simply obey orders
but pete was of a more individualistic
stripe a secret ambition for supreme
command now flowered in his heart he
felt he did not need hardy for a mental
crutch and unlike bundy he had no fear
of the man but he knew that the hardy
influence was far-reaching and that until
more securely entrenched in power and
prestige he must walk slowly in the gam-
blers shadow

  as pete racked up on his powerful-
horse dora rode ahead of dickie to let
the man pass pete rode up even with her
and slowed his gait to hers

  the girls face became a mask of haughti-
ness the intruder evidently intended to
preempt dickies place in a swift side-
glance she noted the heavy gun swinging on
the mans hip

  im in no rush pete opened with
such ingratiating friendliness that the girl
concluded to endure him

  her uncle had told her that western men
always spoke to every man woman and
child they met on the road after all
there was no good reason why she should
not be civil to him

  we were just taking a little ride she
said politely we found the heat oppress-
ive and turned back

  pete drew a deep breath he had seen
dora on the hotel porch but there had been
the width of the street between them
now close to her he saw that she was all
that he ever dreamed a woman could be
the superb elegance of her dress and
equipment her erect gracious form her
violet eyes shaded by the scarlet hat and
the thick gleaming braid that swept the
cantle of the saddle all formed a picture
that filled his hungry eyes-eyes that had
known only filthy under-sized mexican


adventure

women slattern white bawds of the border
and the flimsy girls of the desert towns and
camps

  yet pete was no fool to blindly throw
aside caution certain primeval desires
flamed up within him but he fought them
back she was the loveliest woman he had
ever seen but a saving streak of common
sense told him that she was not to be won
by any of the usual desert methods bundy
had tried one of those usual methods and
now bundy sat in camp croaking like a sick
crow then there were three men to con-
sider hardy norn and uncle charlie
his desert intuition told him that hardy
had a watchful and desirous eye on the
woman no woman as lovely as she could
fail to attract the gamblers attention as
for norn-well he had half-killed bundy
for simply attempting to kiss the girl
uncle charlie had many friends and might
prove if given cause as relentless as a
wounded bear

  no he would present his best side and
leave a pleasant impression later when
secure in his leadership of the gang he
would boldly enter the field

   yes i reckon tis hot to folks not used to
it he agreed widi a bland smile but
its cool up here to what it is ten miles down
manys the time ive left town with my
teeth a-chatterin and inside of two hours
ride be jes hot-yes maam hot as could
be

he expatiated on the climatic
conditions of the desert and gave
her an elaborate description of the
desolate country that lay back of them

   dora smiled at his earnest efforts to make
conversation then she glanced back at
dickie and frowned slightly

   ill ride on pete offered meekly if
im botherin you

   it doesnt matter she lightly returned
though i fear we are giving my brother
more dust than is good for him he is not
very strong

  hard lines for a boy to be sick com-
miserated pete glancing back at dickie
all right ill be siftin along

  petes eyes were now like burning topaz
shot with jet and about his mouth was a
drawn expression that accentuated the pred-
datory curve of his nostrils

  she reined in her horse the desert
rover strove to bid her an elaborate farewell

but the withdrawal of her presence hurt him
like the pulling of a barbed arrow from his
chest he could only turn in his saddle and
call in a harsh voice he scarcely recognized

as his own-

  good-by

  the girl did not answer pete rode into
hemper bowed over his saddle-horn as
though nursing a wound

   dickie rode up to his sister with loud de-
mands for spurs and a gun like that cow-
boy had he had been admiring petes
glittering mexican spurs and pearl-handled
gun

  you shall have the spurs dora prom-
ised but you are not old enough to have a
revolver

  mr norn will let me have a revolver
when i go out to his ranch the boy said a
little rebelliously i bet i could shoot one
right now im not afraid to shoot one

  dora wished that dickie had not men-
tioned norn the boy was forever talking
about the rancher always when she put
aside thoughts of norn came dickie with
his chatter of him to intensify her self-re-
proach for that puritanical outburst

  you seem to think mr norn a wonder-
ful man laddie she observed a trace of
irritation in her tone

   dickies response was disconcerting

   i like him cause he doesnt bother you

  you are not jealous of your sister
this in a low voice and with a vague reali-
zation of the truth of the old saw-out of
the mouth of babes-

   no-o-o the boy hesitated

  what then

  aw i just dont like men that bother
you

  then you havent much cause to worry
teasingly

  you bet i have declared dickie em-
phatically mr brown bothered you
didnt he

   the boy grinned like a young satyr

   the girl flushed uncle charlie had told
her of browns plot to secure norns heri-
tage and of the fat mans failure to meet the
desert test doubtless since she had toler-
ated the smug trickster norn now regarded
her as a feminine counterpart of the brown
type

   dickie ever restless suddenly proposed
that they dismount and build a camp-fire
and to his sisters astonishment proudly ex-
hibited three matches he had hoarded
the survivor



against just such an exigency to humor
him and to lighten her mental gloom the
girl dismounted and pretended that she was
a princess a loyal knight had rescued from
the cruel robbers and taken to his camp in
the forest she helped the enthusiastic lad
build a little camp-fire and played with him
breathing a deep prayer of thankfulness for
his returning health and strength

pete turned his horse into the
stage stable corral and entered the
hardy saloon through the back
door hardy immediately called him into
a card-room and proceeded to sound him
for loyalty and willingness to faithfully
obey orders

  ive been thinkin pete the gambler
said softly after satisfying himself of petes
loyalty that you and me should have got
together long ago bundy never had your
judgment and i was afraid to give him a
big job

  uh huh murmured pete haunted by a
memory of violet eyes beneath a scarlet hat
this girl-

  pete nearly lost his balance as he straight-
ened up in his chair then caution whis-
pered to him

  what girl he queried lazily

  why the wayne girl-uncle charlies
niece

  the gambler looked at his head man in
frank astonishment it were as though pete
had asked what moon or what sun
well what about her indifferently
shes got a lot of money said the gam-
bler in a low tense voice and leaning to-
ward the sprawling pete a lot of it
pete-thousands and thousands of dollars
of cold cash

  you dont expect us to hold her up
do you drawled pete surveying the gam-
bler indolently through half-closed eyes
them kind of people dont carry their
dinero around with them

  hardy cursed the dullness of the spraw-
ling indifferent man

  im no mind-reader pete grumbled
you have to tell me what you want in
united states english

  its just this and hardy drew closer
shes all wrapped up in that sickly kid
get the kid and shell let go of a load of cold
money to see him safe

  what next pete asked eyes on the
ceiling thumbs hooked in cartridge-belt

  ill tend to that hardy snapped
abruptly you-all will get a thousand a-
piece out of it all you have to do is to
corral the boy somehow send me word and
ill see that you get the money

  but how about uncle charlie and his
friends pete drawled thoughtfully

  theyll think the kid is lost the girl
wont say a word ill see to that

  then youll tell her that we got the
boy

  hardy nodded

  seems to me pete objected that
would make things sort o hot for us after
we throwed her back the kid taint likely
shed set still shed still have plenty of
money and a woman never lets up

  this was a delicate point hardy realized
the gangs sole purpose was to secure
money there was no section in its unwritten
by-laws pertaining to woman or kidnaping
but he was offering money-a thousand
dollars to each member of the gang that
should satisfy them and keep them in line

  hardy decided to lay his - carrf-
table faces up

  the bunchll get a thousand apiece and
ill sweeten you a little pete he said flatly
thats fair enough isnt it

  but why bother us with the boy
countered pete why not grab the girl
she-

  pete checked himself abrubtly he did
not want hardy to know for various reasons
that he had ever addressed the girl

  i come across country he went on
pretending thoughtfulness and i saw some
woman in the stage road she had on a red
hat and rode a light horse was that
her

  yes yes hardy assented eagerly
she rides a lot-her and the kid

  why then not grab her and not fool
with the kid

  i want her myself hardy burst out
with an intensity that left no doubt as to
his desires ill marry her shell have
to marry me or lose the kid after she
marries me she cant say anything

  was you figgerin on us blinkin out the
kids lift if it come to a show-down

  yes the gambler snarled his jaw
muscles bulging then his face cleared
and he shook his head but it wont come
to that shell do anything if she thinks it
will save the kid

  but i dont see yet why we shouldnt


adventure

grab her insisted pete seemingly thick-
headed

  hardy scowled pete was a good man
but there was a streak of mulishness in
him

  listen here the gambler snapped im-
patiently i say i want the woman im
not sayin you and the bunch wouldnt
treat her right and throw her over to me
but im free to tell you im takin no
chances money is one thing and woman
another i want this one and im ready
to pay any kind of coin for her-any kind of
coin pete and dont you forget it

  the gamblers tone made the nerves
tinkle in petes gun-arm but he merely
stared up at the ceiling and mumbled a non-
committal uh huh so hardy would
not trust him with the woman but never-
theless expected him to do the dirty work
hardy anticipated no trouble after the boy
was returned to his sister for the black
reason that the hardy brand would then be
on the girl pete debated the feasibility of
killmjtlardy then and there one light-
ifmnove and the gambler would be a dead
man and dead men have no influence or
power what then would hinder him from
doing as hardy proposed doing why
should hardy secure the girl and put him
off with a thousand dollars what was a
thousand dollars compared to such a
woman

  though there was nothing in petes ex-
pression to excite suspicion the gambler
vaguely sensed danger automatically he
moved back a little and let his hand fall
carelessly inside his coat pete knew that
hardy generally carried a short gun in a
shoulder-holster and decided to postpone
the killing until a more opportune time

  all right pete agreed crisply well
grab the boy the first chance we get and
send you word

  but the outlaws mind was busy with
plans that did not include meekly sub-
mitting to those outlined by hardy of
one thing he was sure he would kill hardy
before the gambler placed his brand on the
girl he would report the capture of the
boy collect the money and then kill the
gambler then he would force the girl to
marry him by threatening to do away with
the boy

  then its a go

  yes

  pete arose with his thumbs inside his

belt thus avoiding shaking hands on the
compact

  have a drink hardy invited

  no thanks stomach out of kilter

  hardy looked after pete somewhat ad-
miringly as the latter strode over to the
window a little thick-headed but a
steady reliable man who knew enough to
leave whisky in the barrel

  the gambler joined pete at the window
what he saw made his black eyes brighten

  dickie was being assisted by norn into
the latters buckboard

  theres our chance pete muttered out
of the corner of his mouth and hurried from
the saloon

  it was uncle charlie who left norn little
or no excuse for postponing dickies visit
to the ranch

  when dora and dickie returned to the
hotel after their little play by the camp-
fire the boy noted norns waiting buck-
board and shouted impulsively-

 now mr norn may i go to your
ranch

  take him out king uncle charlie
boomed itll do him good to get away
from being babied by these wimmin around
here

  dora came up on the porch with dickie
clinging to her arm and begging-

  let me go sis please

  she seated herself and drew off her
gloves

  but im afraid you will be too much
bother to mr norn

  she flashed norn a radiant smile which
brought no response her face clouded
would the man never give her an oppor-
tunity to tell him of her aching regret for
those silly prudish words

  ill look after you norn told the boy
avoiding doras mournful eyes

  very well laddie sighed the girl giv-
ing up all hope of coaxing norn into the
trap of conversation run up and tell
mrs milliken to get you ready

  norn found it necessary to arrange some
things in the back of the buckboard al-
though desert jack was there to attend to
such matters

  as they started dickie waved a wild
joyous farewell to his sister and norjj
touched his hat but whether the salute
was meant for uncle charlie or her the girl
could not decide she heard norn warn
jack to drive carefully and her heart
the survivor



warmed at the thoughtfulness of the man
dickie was safe in such hands

  after the buckboard had disappeared
down the desert road the girl turned to
find her uncle studying her

  whats the matter between you and
king norn the old man asked gently
king hasnt said a word to you that i
know of since you come somethin wrong
dora hes the friendliest sort of boy and
white as they make em whats wrong
i hate to hear that a niece of mine didnt
know a white man when she saw one

  oh nothing is wrong she faintly as-
sured him i presume that mr norn-
but she did not finish instead she went
over to her uncle patted his cheek and ran
her fingers through his thick gray shock
then she gathered up her riding-habit
whirled and almost ran up-stairs

chapter viii

pete on entering the camp at the
foot of witch-talk immediately
assembled the gang and told them
of hardys order for the kidnaping of the
boy and dwelt impressively on the gam-
blers promise of a thousand dollars to each
member of the gang as soon as the seizure of
the lad was reported to him pete stated
that he did not know whether hardy would
draw on his own money or force the girl to
pay the ransom

  but thats no truck of ours he urged as
some growls of disapproval greeted his
announcement as long as we get the
money we got no cause to ask questions
hardy guarantees the coin and no trouble
after the boy is throwed loose

  then he quickly launched the plan of
campaign

  the boys at norns ranch saw him go
out today my idee is to close in on the
ranch and pick up the kid so it will look like
hes lost if hes on the pony see that he
never hits the ground until hes in rocky
country well scatter and the man that
grabs the kid is to take him to coyote wells
i figger that no man could spot a trail over
that rocky country head north of twenty-
eight palms and keep to the ridges who-
ever gets the kid is to leave a cross of rocks
at twenty-eight palms just lay out some
stones in the shape of across well be drift-
in back and forwards from twenty-eight
palms to norns place as fast as you find

out that the boy is grabbed go on to coyote
wells the cross of rocks will tell you
whats what but cover trail-cover trail
norn is a bad hombre on a trail de-
mured jenkins the hawk-nosed humorist
who had been so free with gibes for the
miserable bundy hes a stayer and will
hang and rattle to a trail norns no fool
either besides he has some wolves a-
workin for him this looks like a man-
sized job to me

   suit yourself jack pete said indiffer-
ently if you dont want to set in on this
say so and youre off the list for the thou-
sand

aw im in on it jenkins hastily as-
sured him but im a little leery of norn
well sneered pete if your stomachs
weak youd better see a doctor this is no
place for sick men

   jenkins subsided and under petes quick
terse orders they began breaking camp

  bundy though he had made no ob-
jections displayed no enthusiasm for the
work he dawdled about camp nrte
and the other men were ready for the trail
ere he had saddled his horse

  you can watch big wash pete told
bundy impatiently well go on to
norns seein that youre goin to take all
day to throw on a saddle

   bundy made no reply and the gang rode
forth from the camp to be scattered out
under petes direction in much the same
fashion that a round-up boss sends forth
his riders the general orders were to
work in close to the ranch during the day
and make twenty-eight palms a night
camp

  bundy was sore and discouraged pete
had not consulted him and had given him
a minor part the boy would never come
down big wash

  the mountain stream that watered
norns ranch disappeared in the sands of
 big wtash a short distance from the canon
that wound back through norns little em-
pire up to where the stream disappeared
there was a heavy growth of willows along
the banks of the ever-deepening channel
from the willows the great dry wash deep
and wide enough to hide a marching army
wound across the desert toward the eastern
side of the basin

  bundy could reach big wash in a few
minutes ride he decided not to exert
himself he would obey petes order but


adventure

he would make no strenuous effort though
he wanted the thousand dollars he half-
hoped that hardys plan would fall through
for he now hated the gambler far more than
he hated norn norn had merely given
him a beating but hardy had without
good cause pulled him down from the
heights of leadership and made him a
cipher in the eyes of the gang he was
even tempted to slip into hemper and warn
the girl but he could not face the conflict
with hardy that such a procedure would in-
evitably bring hardy would surely kill
him at the first suspicion of treachery

  leisurely bundy rode out to big wash
and followed it about half-way across the
basin then he dismounted and rested and
smoked at nightfall he returned to the
camp at the foot of witch-talk

dickie was delighted beyond
power of expression at the oppor-
tunities the ranch offered to a wild
free rover norn gave the boy a steady old
safkiiiorse and let him run free over the
ranch warning him against all possible
dangers dickie was just a fair rider and
many tilings might happen that would re-
sult in breaking a leg or an arm then
there were the big mountain rattlers that
the lad might not see before it was too late
but it was impossible for norn to be with
dickie every minute and impossible to
keep the youngster close to the house
the boy had gained greatly in strength and
vitality and was bubbling over with cu-
riosity regarding the big canon that wound
up from norns ranch into the mysterious
fastness of rain-maker

  as the days passed dickie became
familiar with the canon and displayed
such an amount of self-reliance that norn
began to feel at ease when the lad came
in fairly yelping with excitement and dis-
playing the rattlers of a big diamond-back
norn congratulated him heartily on win-
ning the trophy

  i killed him with rocks panted dickie
my pony jumped back when he rattled
and i got some rocks and killed the snake
say mr norn he was a big one long
after i had killed him he kept moving i
had to hold him down with a stick and chop
his rattles off with another

  youre getting to be quite a desert-rat
norn complimented

  dickie straightened up manfully he

was showing norn that he was a regular
man

  i guess the boy can take care of himself
norn told desert jack that night hes
city-raised but he has plenty of spirit
there isnt a cowardly hair in his head
got a good brain too and clever beyond his
years

  dickie found the canon an attractive
playground but he often longed to dare the
mysteries of the desert tliat lay shimmering
in the sun far below the green fields of the
ranch

  one clear afternoon when there was just
the faintest hint of fall in the air dickie
rode up the canon he was an imagina-
tive boy and often amused himself by cre-
ating little dramas in which he took the
leading part this habit had been fos-
tered by ill health which forbade his taking
part in the usual games and pastimes of
strength-blessed youngsters also he had
read many stories of adventure and the
heroic characters of the frontier moved
through his boyish dreams invested by a
precocious imagination with god-like powers

  when he came to the stream that brawled
down the canon he recalled that his favor-
ite hero invariably threw the redskins off
the trail by riding down the center of a
stream immediately he preempted the
heros part listening smiling contemp-
tuously and going through the motions of
examining a rifle then continuing the
play he turned his pony and rode down the
shallow stream and unnoticed passed
through uie wide cordon pete had thrown
around the ranch

  the complaining voice of the stream was
soon stilled in the sands of big wash the
lad reined in wondering what a hero
should do when his stream disappears
then he discarded the idea of being pur-
sued by indians and decided that he was
an explorer lost in the wilds of africa the
great sunken smooth-floored way twisting
and turning mysteriously invited him on

  the pony too liked the smooth floor of
the wash and quickened his pace the
boy enjoyed the sense of power and free-
dom that a good horse gives a rider and
let the pony go his way unchecked it was
pleasant to rack around abrupt curves to
draw in deep breaths of the dry invigorating
air and to hum vague little songs

  then dickies stomach sent him a hunger-
warning he visioned the big dining-room
the survivor



of the ranch-house and decided that
a large bowl of bread and milk would be a
most satisfactory finale to a perfect day
with some misgivings he noted that the
sun was setting and decided to get out of
die wash he had a vague idea of cutting
across country to the ranch but to him
the sheer banks of the wash offered no
egress and he was half-minded to double
back over his old trail

	suddenly the wash flared out and merged
with another great wash beyond which
a mountain loomed dusk was settling
down and the desert lay shrouded in gray
gloom before the wondering eyes of the boy
completely turned around the loom of
witch-talk was to him the towering shape
of rain-maker

  recalling that one of his heroes had
trusted to the intelligence of his horse to
take him safely through the trackless wilds
he dropped the reins over the saddle-horn
and let the old desert pony go his way
but the horse had no intention of returning
to the ranch when there was water and green
grass within a few minutes canter in
other days he had often visited the sheltered
nook at the foot of witch-talk and was
now headed straight for that desirable graz-
ing-ground

  dickie saw a little fire winking through
the trees and imagined that in some miracu-
lous fashion he had returned to norns
canon

  the pony intent on reaching the water
racked up eagerly and it was with difficulty
that dickie reined him in near the fire

  whats wanted came a strange voice
from the darkness

  dickie looked about him this wasnt
the ranch

  i guess im lost he answered bravely
enough

  bundy approached the fire easing down
the hammer of his rifle

  dickie dismounted bundy seized the
lads arm and drew him over to the fire
the boy looked up and recognized the man
who had insulted his sister he jerked
free and drew back

  youre a bad man he shrilled if i
were big enough id whip you

  bundy laughed softly

  you scared my sister dickie accused
with a great show of hostility

  now kid bundy soothed youre jes
hungry ill get you something to eat

  dickie made a manly attempt to hold his
hostile attitude but weakened before the
insistent clamors of his stomach and the
mans friendliness

  bundy swiftly prepared a meal for the
boy

  there you are the man said when the
meal was ready throw that into you
and youll feel better thats mountain-
sheep itll make the hair grow on your
chest dig into it

  dickie seated himself by the fire and fell
to eating

  i know you got reasons for not likin
me bundy gently admitted but i didnt
mean to scare your sister my horse
started pitchin and i couldnt hold him

im sorry about it

as the boy ate he found it in-
creasingly difficult to regard the
man as an enemy food is the
open-sesame to a boys heart and then
had the man not said he was sorry a
gentleman according to- iwemes code
always forgave those who admitsake--
error of their ways

  when his hunger was appeased the boy
decided he would forgive the man he
was a little doubtful as to how to proceed
but decided that shaking hands would indi-
cate suspension of hostilities so he arose
and approached bundy who was seated
turk-fashion by the fire

  the boy extended his hand

  your pology is accepted he said
quoting one of his heroes

  bundy grinned and shook the lads hand
heartily

  youre a thoroughbred he said and
he held the boys hand a little longer than
was necessary

  bundy felt that his luck had turned
the gang was at twenty-eight palms and
would have to bear the brunt of the battle
with norn and uncle charlie the boy
was in his power and he proposed to in-
gratiate himself in the lads favor to such
an extent that the youngster would not
question his motives he would take the
lad to the desert lulls and follow the rocky
ridge of the range back into the fastnesses of
rain-maker norn would doubtless strike
the trail of the boy and follow it to witch-
talk

  bundy walked over to dickies pony
yes the horse was shod and would leave an


adventure

unmistakable trail but once on the rocky
ridge of the desert range even a shod horse
would leave no trail norn would follow
the trail to the desert hills but would lose
it on the ridge then there was the possi-
bility of the rancher clashing with the gang
before reaching the desert hills

  secure in some retreat among the crags of
rain-maker he would fit up a little camp
for the boy and prevail on him to re-
main there then he would take the horses
and slip down to hemper there under
the cover of darkness he would contrive to
get word to the girl that he had rescued her
brother from the gang but that the boy had
been weakened by the harsh experience and
was too ill to move he would tell the girl
that the lad was constantly calling for her
and that he believed the boy would die
unless she immediately came to his rescue

 he would demand that she secretly
accompany him back to the boy he would
tell her of hardys part in the affair con-
vince her that he had endangered his life
by coming into town he would point out
that fffe only thing for her to do would be
to safeguard the one man who knew of the
boys whereabouts if she threatened to
betray him he would pretend to wash his
hands of the whole affair if she asked him
why he had rescued the boy from the gang
he would indicate the fact of the gambler
having deposed him from leadership as the
motive for revenge and for good measure
pretend that he desired to make amends for
having insulted her to prove the truth
of his statements he would show her some
article belonging to the boy or he might
possibly prevail on the lad to write her a
note

  then when he had the girl in his power
he would work south by degrees and into
mexico perhaps after tiring of her he
would exact from her a heavy ransom and
release her

  he was uncertain as to what he would do
with the boy

  of one thing however he was certain
his revenge against hardy would be full
and complete pete too would have good
cause to remember him he would find a
way to get a mocking message to the gang

  ill show em all where i head in he
muttered as he returned to the fire

  feelin better kid he asked smiling
down at the boy

  yes sir dickie politely assented

  howd you like to have me take you
back to norns tonight

  id like it the boy said cheerfully

  well then you jes rest till i get my
hawse ready

  bundy led the way from the camp
veering south to strike the desert hills far
beyond twenty-eight palms it was a
gray night but the man knew every trail
and wash in the basin and without diffi-
culty entered the desert hills leading the
boys horse since dickie was beginning to
show signs of fatigue

  i guess wed better camp bundy told
the boy when they came to the head of
one of the rock-ribbed canons whose tribu-
taries led up to the barren ridge over which
he expected to swing north to rain-maker
theres water here and im kind o lost
besides youre tired aint you tired
kid

  yes admitted the boy wearily

  bundy helped the lad dismount and un-
rolled a blanket he had tied on the back of
his saddle

  lay down on this he said spreading
out the blanket

  all right murmured the stiff and weary
dickie sleepily

  bundy wrapped the blanket about the
boy tucking it under his feet snugly and
insisting that the lad keep his arms under
cover when the man had finished tuck-
ing in the blanket the boy looked like a
swathed mummy	

  dickie was soon fast asleep

  bundy though he had no blanket
sprawled out on the ground with a saddle
for a pillow and his weapons close at hand

  presently he too was asleep

for a long time the big mountain
rattler watched the huge recumbent
figure his snakeship had ventured
from a snug retreat not far from the
spring in quest of rats he had been
weaving along concerned entirely with
his hunger when suddenly before him
a huge mountain stirred immediately he
coiled and sounded his warning then
as the mountain failed to make any hostile
move the snake relaxed his tense coil half-
minded to crawl away but the mountain
moved again and he immediately resumed
his tense coil sounding his dry deadly
warning

  bundy was lying on his back but some
the survivor



irregularity in the ground made that posi-
tion uncomfortable and gradually the sub-
conscious mind became aware of that dis-
comfort and signaled the body to turn
over bundy turned over his right arm
extended then he thrust out his hand to
rest his arm full length on the ground
the rattler saw that hand approach him
in what he believed to be a menacing fashion
and struck out and hooked his fangs in a
linger bundy awoke with heart-shaking
suddenness to hear the low whirr of the
rattler he sucked in his breath as he
felt a dart of pain in his finger he grabbed
his gun and fired at the dark mound from
which ensued the dry deadly buzzing

  the roar of the gun jerked poor dickie
from slumber with a suddenness that nearly
wrecked his nerves he fought his way
out of the blanket whimpering and half-
sobbing the darkness and the strange
environment into which the bellow of the
heavy six-shooter had suddenly precipitated
the boy made mm forget for the nonce
that he was a brave man and he relapsed
into whimpering childishness

  bundy disregarding all caution found
a match and in feverish haste started a
fire

  he got me sobbed the man then
in a mad unreasonable rage he began
trampling the snake dickie stared at the
wild spectacle his little heart pounding
furiously against his ribs

  as bundy trampled the rattler he cursed
wildly and hopelessly there was a wail-
ing note of doom in his voice that made the
lads skin prickle

  the fire flamed up and the man saw the
boys white drawn face through a red haze
of rage and realized he was wasting tune
he leaped over the fire rasping out in a
choked voice

  come here boy-quick a snake bit
me you got to help me heres my knife
come now quick hurry boy or im a
goner

  slowly dickie approached the fire and
started at the mans hand

  right there on that finger-see-cut it
lengthways then across

  shuddering but filled with sympathy for
the man the boy took the knife awkwardly
bundy knelt and laid his hand on his knee

  im up against it son he told dickie
with forced calmness youre the only
one to help me

  the mans appeal gave the lad a new
lease on his courage and he tightened his
jaws and dropped down on his knees but
when he made the first gash in the finger
he cringed and averted his face

  bundy patted the boys shoulder en-
couragingly

  brace up kid now slash it across

  does it hurt dickie quavered shud-
dering

 - no roared the man cut it-

quick

  dickie made a supreme effort steadied
his hand and slashed the finger across

  now son explained bundy forcing
himself to speak casually lest the lad
succumb to the strain he was putting 
him ill have to ask youto suck the blood
out of that finger it wont hurt you be-
cause your mouth is clean i cant do it
myself because i smoke so much that my
mouth is raw so if you suck the blood
out you will take the snake poison with it
and save my life if you dont ill die here
pretty quick do you want me to die

  no gulped dickie his eyes wide with
the dread of death

  it was the supreme test of the boys
courage and will power the sight of the
blood nauseated him and his senses reeled
as he thought of putting the finger in his
mouth but he seized bundys hand and
faithfully obeyed the low-toned directions
of the man

  there thats good bundy said grate-
fully thank you

  youre welcome returned dickie his
nostrils flaring and striving to wipe the
taste of the blood from his tongue with the
back of his hand

  bundy drew a silk handkerchief from his
shirt pocket and tied it around his fore-
arm he broke off a piece of greasewood
and twisted the handkerchief with all his
strength then he pressed his arm against
his side to hold the tourniquet in position

  but the rattler that had bitten bundy
was old and the venom he had injected
into the veins of the man was like liquid
fire

  bundy realized that he must get to a
doctor or perish like most desert-rals
he had a contempt for rattlesnakes and
had never bothered about carrying an anti-
dote for snake-bite

  there was only one thing to do take the
boy and ride to hemper there he would


adventure

turn the lad over to his uncle and tell him
thathe had rescued him from the gang
that would of course require the connivance
of the lad which meant making a clean
breast of the whole affair to him and trust-
ing to his boyish sympathy

  listen son he began hurriedly we
got to get out of here and hit the trail for
hemper now i want you to play square
wi th me i want you to lie for me 

 the boy regarded him with round
wondering eyes

it is wrong to lie he stated emphati-
cally my sister says it is wrong to lie
the man bowed his head slightly as
though in mute obeisance to the clean
little soul confronting him

  yes i know son he admitted gently
it is wrong to lie but this is a case where a
lie will save my life you see boy i didnt
take you home as i said i would that
will make men in hemper want to kill me
or put me in jail but if you say i took
you from some other men and started home
with you that will save my life i got to
totlemper so a doctor can cure my snake-
bite

  ill lie for you to save your life dickie
promised solemnly

  but will you do as i say will you
tell everybody like this he took me from
some men and brought me home say it
yes sir the boy agreed and slowly
repeated-

  he took me from some men and brought
me home 

  shake on it

  for answer the lad laid his hand in the
mans huge paw

chapter ix

      he was known as the apache
kid though he had no indian blood
in his veins a childless squaw had
found him cooing and gurgling in a grub
box following a massacre of some foolhardy
argonauts she had taken the baby to
her heart and in the years that followed
he not only became versed in indian cun-
ning but acquired a snake-like quickness
with the white mans weapon the six-
shooter ere he had the suspicion of a
hair on his face he had killed his first
man

  killing followed killing until even the
most hardened desperadoes of the then

 lawless southwest came to regard the
 apache kid as the apogee of deadliness
 many gun-twirlers secretly longed to kill
 him not through any desire to benefit the
 general public but to acquire at one shot
 the kids red fame now and then the
 mexican border was reminded of the fact
 that he who let such ambitions goad him
 into action invariably departed this life
 ere a watch could tick a second

   now to the apache kid in the fulness
 of his power and playing a lone hand in
 the game of outlawry along the mexican
 border came luring accounts of a woman
 of wondrous beauty in a town a weeks ride
 to the north

   at first the kid had been indifferent
 deeming the report in line with those of
 fabulous mountains of gold in desert infer-
 nos but men continued to talk of the
 girl at hemper and gradually his interest
 was aroused money he could secure by
 playing cards with men who were afraid to
 win from him and killing had become more
 or less a routine there remained only
 woman and he was twenty-two

    stage-drivers off duty are generally a
 garrulous set and the kid found one who
 had seen the girl at hemper

   the driver was pleased to enlighten the
 youth since he knew that young mans
 uncertain temper and was aware the kid
 had killed men for no known reason except
 to see em kick

   theres nothing like her in this coun-
 try the driver declared fervently shes
 sure somethin you can rest your eyes on
  kid ive seen pretty wimmin in my time
 but she takes all bets i saw her once in
 front of the hotel her uncle runs and i says
 then says i there goes the finest-lookin
 girl in gawd-amightys world black
 hair kid with a glisten to it and a fig-
 ger-

   the driver paused unable to find words
 to express his rapturous thoughts

    but he went on finally it wasnt so
 much her fine looks as it was the way of her
 old as i be with my hair wore down to the
 rind that gals way called to me like a chunk
 of gold in the sun if i was a young man
 id try to win her and if i died a-tryin i
 wouldnt care she is sure the kind that
 calls to a man and i reckon theres many
 a man lookin her way but shes cold-
 cold as a diamond rich too and no scrub
 can get within speakin distance of her
the survivor



  whats she doin out here the kid
asked softly

  sick brother-con-sumpted i guess or
leanin towardit brought him out to get him
cured up jes a boy well i must begoin

  the kid leaned against an adobe build-
ing and considered the information given
him by the driver he admitted no inter-
est yet he was aware of a strange restless-
ness that night he drifted north thirty
miles and the next day killed a mexican
in a monte-game dispute the kid was
naturally irritable and the strange rest-
lessness had not tended to blunt the deadly
fangs of his temper

  again he mounted and drifted north
some forty or fifty miles in a little stage
station on a bleak mesa he met face to
face the brother of a man he had killed
in arizona the kid frowned darkly and
the brother of the victim of the killers
lightning lead passed on to strengthen his
nerves with strong waters

  always did he have to kill men thought
the kid peevishly in time this brother
of the man who had bowed to his lead
would come seeking satisfaction

  the kid did not have long to wait the
man maddened with vile whisky charged
from a doonvay firing as he advanced
the kids right gun barked briefly and the
man slumped to the ground

  that night the kid rode forty miles and
a few days later sauntered into chance
hardys saloon his fame preceding him

  hardy accorded the youth with the rat-
tlesnake jaw and restless bloodshot eyes
the utmost deference the gamblers atti-
tude deeply impressed certain officers of
the law who looked to him for guidance in
all matters then the kids appearance
did not belie his fame he looked bad
and his glance was like a knife-thrust

  hardy extended to the kid the hospi-
tality of his place the youth oddly
enough did not drink but he was an invet-
erate gambler hardy steered him to the
faro layout signaling to the pasty-faced
dealer to permit the visitor to win a rea-
sonable amount

  the kid was a nervous player and de-
manded plenty of elbow-room his deadly
darting glances soon cleared a space around
him and as he began to win he smiled his
curious mirthless smile

  suddenly he decided he had won enough
and cashed in the eyes of every man in

the saloon followed him as he sauntered to
the door he whirled on them with start-
ling suddenness and as one man the watch-
ers flinched he smiled comprehension of
their fears and edged through the doorway

  youll have to let me go if the kid
comes back the faro-dealer whined to
hardy id as soon deal to a rattler

  uncle charlie in his chair on the hotel
porch saw the kid approaching and turned
to dora with more excitement than she had
ever seen him display

  get up-stairs-quick girl he puffed in
heavy whispers

  what is the matter with you uncle
she exclaimed unable to see any cause for
his intense excitement

  then before uncle charlie could answer
the kids spurs jingled on the steps and the
old man gripped the arms of his chair and
stared fixedly at the intruder

  the girl saw an under-sized youth in his
early twenties bow-legged and slope-shoul-
dered from years of riding he was armed
with two heavy pearl-handled revolvers
but that struck her as nothing omwal
since her arrival in hemper she had seen
many armed men her feminine mind
unschooled in the signs of deadliness failed
to note the murderous cruelty deep-etched
in the face of the apache kid to her he
was merely some cowboy come to speak a
few words to her uncle

  she suddenly became aware of a deathly
stilness broken only by the jingle of the
strangers spurs as he deliberately ap-
proached her she could see men across
the street and there was an odd intentness
in their attitudes she saw hardy back of
the breast-high swinging doors of his sa-
loon and he too was intently watching
the youth who to her annoyance had halted
close to her and was staring down at her

  the kid having done as he pleased since
boyhood saw no reason why he should not
tell this woman of rare beauty the purpose
of his visit to hemper

  i come three hundred miles to see you
he told her in a low expressionless voice
and i dont think im goin to leave this
town loser

uncle charlie moved slightly
praying for the old sharpes and a
dead rest the kid flashed him a
glance of deadly warning the old mans
face turned a ghastly purple and in his


adventure

eyes came a look of dumb pathos old
slow and fat he realized he was as helpless
as an ox before this deadly youth whose
smooth-hammered triggerless guns hung
within easy reach of his supple hands it
was not fear that held the landlord motion-
less in his chair but his knowledge of the
mental processes of killers and the realiza-
tion of his own helplessness he knew that
such as the apache kid struck swiftly at
the slightest unusual move and he felt that
it would be sheer folly to throw his life away
unless the kid went beyond mere words

  for several moments the killer appraised
the beauty of the girl and then in that
same expressionless voice-

  i reckon im goin to like you

  this was too much even from a cowboy
who might be a friend of her uncle she
arose and being taller than the kid looked
down at him haughtily and then turned to
her uncle

  uncle she said in her coolest and most
impersonal tone this man is annoying me
will you please order him away

jtstkid lifted his upper lip in a wolf-like
grin it touched his vein of evil humor to
imagine a fat old man ordering him to do
anything he was half-tempted to kill
the old man just to impress the girl uncle
charlie read that murderous thought in the
dark face and twitching hands and held
himself motionless and mute

  her uncles failure to protect her hurt the
girl as well as sorely puzzled her she
would go to her room she turned to enter
the office but the kid blocked the way

  let me pass she commanded as though
addressing some insolent servant

  this amused the kid she was a thor-
oughbred and he would find much pleasure
in taming her apparently she was una-
ware of the identity of the man she was
addressing therefore to a certain extent
he would enlighten her

  that old man over there he said
softly darting an ophidian glance at uncle
charlie do you want to see that old man
die

  the girl grew sick with horror as she
slowly comprehended the threat of ruth-
less murder his question carried for the
first time she glimpsed his perverted soul
mocking her through dark bloodshot eyes

  sit down then the kid suggested as
an alternative likely to delay the demise of
the fat old man

  she backed toward a chair and seated
herself the kid came close to her and
one slim hand crept out and smoothed her
hair she shuddered at his touch her eyes
on his pearl-handled guns

  the kids hand strayed down her shoul-
der and arm and closed about her wrist
he lifted her hand and examined the white
smooth fingers curiously then his gaze
focused on a ring she wore a filigreed gold
circlet set with a cluster of diamonds and
rubies in a childish mood he removed the
ring and placed it on one of his own slim
fingers

  you must have plenty of dinero he
remarked his mood now that of a simple
savage playing with a gaud how much
it cost

  dora was now fully aware that the man
before her was more dangerous than a rat-
tlesnake any moment the murderous
mood might return she must humor him
it was not a nightmare but stark reality
a deadly stranger had threatened her un-
cles life and removed a ring from her finger
her uncle had drifted away from her and
was now vague and remote there were
other men within call but they seemed
frozen incapable of movement she was
alone-and helpless

  never before had she faced the terrible
fact of womans helplessness she was
no stronger than maria had been when the
paiute had roused her and drove her to her
death there had been a time ages ago
when her womans helplessness seemed a
charming attribute in that other world
where money ruled and police watched
every corner women prided themselves on
their helplessness in this world where
nothing counted save the ability to kill
swiftly there was no romance in helpless-
ness no charm in weakness here despite
her wealth her refinement and culture her
mind infinitely superior to that of the crea-
ture before her she was just a helpless
woman

  and there was no man to whom she could
turn for protection then suddenly a figure
took form in the mirror of her mind a sure
reliable dominant being who was all that
she was not to that figure her thoughts
turned with joyful relief it came to her
from some mystic source that that figure
would stand between her and all danger
yet she could not bring herself to name the
figure pride held her back she who had
the survivor



always been heart-free could not imme-
diately bow to love she who had remained
quiescent amused at the struttings of male
egotists indifferent to their love agonies
could not in one quick breath admit that
danger had stirred love to call up the vision
of the sure reliable dominant one

  how much it cost impatiently re-
peated the kid

  seven hundred dollars she answered
faintly

  the kid examined the ring with renewed
interest

  a bunch of yearlins in that he mut-
tered marveling that so tiny a thing could
be so valuable

  how many hawses would it bring he
queried turning the ring on his finger

  i can not tell you unless you tell me
what horses cost she replied praying that
he would take the ring and go

  say at fifty dollars a head

  it would then bring fourteen horses
she calculated mechanically

  the kid counted his fingers indian-
fashion

  ill keep it he announced coolly

  then the murderous mood returned and
he gave uncle charlie a malignant glance

  placing a hand under the girls chin he
tilted up her face and in a monotone as
dry and deadly as the whirr of a rattler he
voiced his evil plan

  tomorrow you go south with me ill
treat you right if you dont hang back i
come a long trail for you and im not goin
back alone

  he stepped back and stared at her with
a concentrated deadliness that gave her
the sensation of sinking sinking sinking
though her lips were mute her soul frantic
and utterly desperate called-

  norn norn save mel

  it was done her soul had named the
dominant figure of her visioning come
sorrow come agony come death she loved
king norn love and hope came and
drove back the shadows norn would pro-
tect her in time he would forgive her
forget that prudish outburst and stand be-
tween her and all danger she smiled wanly
touched by the mystery of love

  she was mocking him thought the kid
noting her smile she thought he had been
speaking vain empty words again he
seriously considered killing the fat old man
just to impress her his gaze fastened on

the heavy inert figure in the big chair he
half-drew his right gun and in a vicious
aside snarled at the girl

  you aint said youd go with me yet
do i have to kill that old man now

  ill go with you she cried weakly fully
expecting to see her uncle shot

  the kid lifted his upper lip in the wolf-
like grin and edged oft the porch satisfied
that she was thoroughly intimidated and
that on the morrow she would to save her
uncles life ride south with him

  as tiie apache kid swung across the street
with his lurching awkward riders stride the
watchers drew back lest they attract his
hostile attention hardy entered his little
sanctum shaking with jealous rage against
the kid but when the killer entered the
saloon he found the gambler seemingly en-
grossed in business

  the moment the kid passed through the
swinging doors of the saloon uncle charlie
almost hurled himself from his chair and
dragged the girl into the office

  get up-stairs he pantedand lock
yourself in here wait and take niy-sijfc
shooter

  hurriedly he secured the heavy revolver
and thrust it in her trembling hand and
pushed her toward the stairway

  that was the apache kid he yelled
as he seized his old sharpes a killer
whosas bad as a blind snake hell do as he
says get to your room girl and stay therel

  dumbly she obeyed him

  uncle charlie locked and barred the front
door of the hotel then he waddled back
and ordered chang to hold the kitchen at
all costs from the kitchen he plunged
into the alley back of the hotel and made
his way puffing and panting to meekers
store

  we got to get some men together he
shouted at the storekeeper the apache
kids after my niece-swears hell take her
south with him

  but hes a dangerous man demurred
meeker

  but you went out with me after billy
snake roared uncle charlie

  yes i know but that was just an in-
dian meeker side-stepped

  in a bull-like rage uncle charlie stormed
from the store calling the storekeeper a
yellow dog and a prune-countin skunk

  bill watson the blacksmith felt that the
apache kid was out of his class


adventure

  they say hes killed over twenty men
rumbled the blacksmith mournfully id
jes try to get him when he wasnt lookin
if i was you

  but the big iron-thumper carefully
avoided volunteering to assist in ridding
hemper of the killer

  from man to man waddled uncle char-
lie wheedling one cursing another but to
no avail he had supposed that the busi-
ness men of the little town would turn out
en masse but he was wofully disappointed
most of them that he approached had been
chilled by doras indifference to their self-
imagined charms and felt no call to protect
the girl she was stuck-up let her look
after herself

  the landlord believed that an appeal to
the lawless element controlled by hardy
would be a waste of breath dora had not
told him of hardys proposal of marriage
and so he counted the gambler a friend
and backer of the kid

  so he went his weary hopeless way
attemptiio drum up a vigilance commit-
itamong the so-called respectables but
respectability even in a lawless desert town
has a habit of carefully guarding its own
precious hide respectability never won
any wars or freed any slaves the fighting
is generally done by the men whom the re-
spectables warn their wives against

  true respectability had been represented
in the posse that had taken the trail of the
indian but when uncle charlie went over
the list he found the lawless ones the men
without property the partisans of hardy
had formed the majority of that posse

  the old man returned to the hotel
crushed and beaten but the feel of the
old sharpes heartened him he would
fortify himself in the office and defend his
citadel to the best of his ability

as he entered the saloon the kid
signaled to hardy that he desired
speech with him the gambler gave
a sawed-off shotgun reposing in the corner
of his sanctum a fleeting glance but having
no desire to die quickly set his face in the
gamblers mask and obeyed the summons

  i aim to tame that filly over there the
kid announced jerking his head in the
direction of the hotel and i dont look for
no one to set in on my game

  back to wall hands twitching close to
low-hung guns a restless ursine swing to his

  head the kid was not a being to my dear-
fellow into changing his mind or to salve
with flattery or to reprove in the ringing
tones of the stage hero

  words to the apache kid were unim-
portant save when they heralded gun-talk
he had made his announcement not out of
bravado but to ascertain if there was a
possibility of hardy disapproving of his
plan if he caught the faintest hint of dis-
approval on the gamblers part he would
kill him seize the girl and start for the bor-
der immediately

  the kid was a first-class killer but a
poor poker-player hardy read his face as
easily as he would the reflection of a card
in a mirror the gambler realized that he
must say the right words in exactly the
right way or be shot down further the
gambler knew the psychology of fear he
knew that it was entirely possible for a man
of the kids reputation to intimidate a whole
town to successfully attack this master
gun-twirler there would have to be a
leader ready and willing to die such a
leader was not to be secured in hemper
and the gun-fighters that might be bribed
into daring the kids lead were in the des-
ert watching for an opportunity to seize
the girls brother

  the gamblers answer was toneless and
impersonal

  a mans woman is his own business he
said flicking the ash from his cigar

  the kids searching gaze played recur-
rently across hardys mask-like face like
flashes of sheet-lightning

  a good way to look at it darkly com-
mented the killer

  then he looked down at the ring and
held up his hand for hardy to inspect the
setting but his right hand remained close
to his gun

  she give that to me he attempted to
grin with one corner of his mouth his eyes
half-closed she says its wuth fourteen
hawses a right purty ring-hey hombre

  this strained the gamblers self-control
close to the breaking-point volcanic rage
seethed within him and through a red haze
the glittering ring mocked him but he
held himself steady and no flicker of flame
in his eyes gave hint of the storm of rage
within him he even essayed a smile as he
lightly remarked-

  nothin like bein a favorite with the
ladies
the survivor



  he pretended to admire the ring his mind
groping madly for some sure method of
blotting out the man who had so calmly
muddled his plans if the gang captured
the boy it was plain that he could not
marry the girl until the kid was out of the
way then there was norn to be consid-
ered while the rancher evidently had no
interest in the girl he would hold himself
responsible for the boys safety with the
kid blocking the way norn would have
time to ascertain that the gang had cap-
tured the boy and immediately conclude
that they were holding the lad for ransom
norn would then come directly to him
knowing that he controlled the gang and
that meant gun-smoke

  the gamblers attitude of indifference
seemed to satisfy the kid for he resumed
his bucking of the faro game much to the
sweating agitation of the dealer hardy had
neglected to relieve but never for a mo-
ment did the killer relax his distrustful vigi-
lance he insisted that the rear of the
saloon be kept clear of men and his ever-
restless eyes traveled from lay-out to doors
from doors to the faces of the men lounging
against the bar and back to the lay-out

  hardy once was on the point of snatch-
ing up the sawed-off shotgun and taking
the long chance but he could not quite free
his soul of the awe of the kids red record
then a hanger-on slipped in and pretend-
ing to ask for money managed to whisper
to the gambler

  the kids goin to take the girl south
with him tomorrow uncle charlies penned
himself in and turnin everybody back

  hardy gave the hanger-on a coin and
waved him away

  this thought the gambler did not help
matters to force the girl to marry him
he would have to tell her of her brothers
peril now uncle charlie having noted
his friendly relations with the kid would
not permit him within speaking distance
of the girl while the kid might brave the
thunder of the old sharpes the gambler
admitted that he had no stomach for facing
the buffalo gun even if he could get to
the girl there was the kid still blocking his
game therefore the apache kid must
die ere the dawn broke

  perhaps the killer would relax his vigi-
lance then one desperate move and both
barrels of the shotgun but he must wait
until he had a perfect drop on the killer



if the kid caught him reaching for the shot-
gun the gun-master would kill him as he
had a score of men within the space of a
split second to be sure he must mve the
gun cocked and on the man before dis-
covered even then he was doubtful of his
ability to pull the triggers before the kids
magic guns hashed into action and there
was no record of the kid ever having missed
a man

  while the kid toyed with faro a town
character known as sunshine entered
the saloon stopped short at the end of the
bar and stared fascinatedly at the killer

  some men twitted sunshine concerning
the big rusty revolver he carried in a raw-
hide holster at first the kid moved
nervously under the gawkish stare of the
huge but harmless sunshine then the
killer noted that the big man was the butt
of various humorous remarks and classified
him as harmless

  sunshine did not intrude on the kid but
moved from one point of vantage to an-
other staring at him with round rabbit
eyes fascinated by the killers deadlinessr
the stare of the harmless sunshine amused
the watchers even the kid lifted his upper
lip in his wolf-like grin

  your heads open bantered the killer
look out for flies

  at this sally the watchers laughed as
courtiers laugh at the mildewed jest of a
king but sunshine continued to stare his
face empty as that of a hypnotists subject

  the laughter of the watchers caused the
kid to unbend further playfully he beck-
oned sunshine to him the big man came
with heavy dragging steps the kid re-
lieved him of his big gun and made a futile
attempt to turn the rusty empty cylinder
then he blew cigaret smoke in the muzzle
and with one lightning move tossed the
gun back into the rawhide holster sun-
shine looked down at his gun with the blank
astonishment of a country yokel in whose
hat a magician has discovered a setting of
eggs

chapter x

norn considered the canon a safe
playground for dickie the lad
on the old and cautious pony could
go no farther than the first waterfall and
only an experienced and resourceful rider
could negotiate any of the narrow game-
trails that zigzagged skyline-ward thus


adventure

when dickie rode away that balmy after-
noon the rancher felt no misgivings the
lad would return in an hour or two

  when dickie had disappeared in the wil-
lows and cottonwoods that hid the stream
from view norn resolved to inspect his
young apple orchard that set on some high
land back from the hemper road

  as he rode through the young trees the
rancher was puzzled to note that some
riders had recently crossed his orchard he
questioned the necessity of riding through
tiie plowed ground when there was a hard
road between the ranch road and the or-
chard he found that the mysterious
riders had on exiting from the orchard
turned toward the ranch and then doubled
back through the orchard gradually
black suspicion began to form in his mind
members of the gang were prowling over
his ranch why had they decided to
break the old truce

  the rancher circled the orchard and re-
turned to the ranch-house desert jack
reported that dickie had not returned

      decided to ascertain if the mysterious
riders had invaded his canon and at the
same time assure himself of the boys
safety he did not take the canon road
but followed a narrow trail along a big ditch
thal tapped the stream at the falls

  pete had several reasons for sending
pedro the only mexican in the gang into
the canon the mexican had worked on
round-up for norn and at times had been
given permission to hunt on the big ranch
thus pedro was most familiar with the
trails that led down the sides of the canon
if the mexican were discovered by norn
pete reasoned the ranchers suspicions
would not be aroused so quickly as they
would if he found a white man lurking
in his canon then pete believed the
mexican could be trusted to do as he was
told pete knew that pedro stood in awe of his
anger and was confident that the mexican
would not dare to play a crooked game

  pedro dragged his horse down a trail that
a goat would hesitate to follow and struck
the floor of the canon a short distance below
the waterfall he concealed his horse in
some alders and proceeded to watch the road

  norn screened from the mexicans view
by the trees and undergrowth rode up to
the waterfall there he turned into the
canon road and began searching for fresh
tracks of dickies pony apparently the

boy had not come to the falls the rancher
dismounted and led his horse some distance
down the road studying the old tracks
suddenly his eye caught the movement of
some creature in the alders he slipped
back and secured his saddle-gun venison
was always welcome with the utmost
caution he approached the alders

  the mexican was intently watching the
road beyond him and when norn spoke to
him he sprang to his feet chattering like a
startled monkey

  for a time the rancher studied the shak-
ing pedro and then abruptly ordered-
drop your rifle

 the mexican promptly obeyed norn
relieved him of his six-shooter and knife

  now demanded the rancher with a
deadly dominating note in his voice why
are you in my canon

  the mexican began babbling about hunt-
ing but norn silenced him

  you did not come to the house and se-
cure my permission you slipped into the
canon like a coyote did you expect to
find deer in the road why should i not
kill you as i would a coyote

  the mexican resumed his babbling
don keeng was a generous man who
had no thought for one little deer don
keeng was also a man with many things
on his mind and must not be disturbed by
a man merely desiring to hunt on this
magnificent ranch

  but pedros babbling was wasted on the
rancher

  walk ahead of me norn ordered

  he drove the mexican back to his horse
there he secured a rope and presently
pedro was bound hand and foot

  norn then took the cleaning-rod from its
hiding-place in the butt of his gun and
carefully screwed it together his next
move was to build a little fire

  as he laid the cleaning-rod in the fire he
observed with quiet assurance

  this will make you speak the truth
pedro in a little while you will have a
taste of hell

  norn knew every twist and turn of the
mexican mind if the gang had broken
the old truce and was plotting some sort of
devilment this was an excellent oppor-
tunity to get first-hand information

  the possible capture of dickie by the
gang did not enter his mind the boy was
probably at the ranch-house now the
the survivor



rancher was thinking of his herds was
the gang about to exact tribute from him
if so he must prepare for war he had no
intention of burning the mexican for he
was confident that pedro would speak the
truth when he felt the irons hot breath

  pedro on the other hand had only the
capture of the boy in mind he had been
watching norns every move with terror-
widened eyes when the rancher placed
the iron in the fire he sucked in his breath
ah the torture mother of god who could
endure the fire torture

  norn pulled off the mexicans boots
then he examined the iron and thrust it
back in the flames

  not hot enough he observed distinctly
for pedros benefit

  when the iron was red-hot norn sud-
denly jerked it from the flames and sav-
agely approached the mexican

  pedros soul sickened as he felt the hot
breath of the iron

  speak the truth thou dog gritted
norn in spanish or walk through hell

  by the cross the truth i speak howled
the frantic mexican the brother of the
beautiful senorita is sought by pete that
senor hardy may give to each man much
gold

  norn stopped short and then tossing
aside the iron swiftly unbound the mexi-
can and hurled him toward his horse

  to the ranch he snapped and pedro
gray with fear galloped ahead of him

  the mexican knew that he could not
now return to the gang pete would not
listen to explanations his safety lay in
keeping close to norn

  norn as he rode even with him read the
mexicans thoughts

  you will stay at my place pedro he
said your friends would kill you if i
sent them word that pedro answered when
the little hot iron spoke to him is it not
the part of wisdom to be my man

  si senor the mexican quickly agreed
breathing heavily it is the part of wisdom

  then i will forget what has passed and
will say that pedro had my permission to
hunt in the canon

the rancher had not neglected to
watch the road and when they
came to the place where dickie had
turned down the stream his sharp eyes dis-
cerned the tell-tale hoof-prints in the mud

perhaps one of the gang had intercepted
the boy and either inveigled or forced him
to ride down the stream he spurred up
his horse and with pedro galloping ahead
dashed back to the ranch-house

  placing pedro in charge of desert jack
norn hurriedly told the foreman of the
mexicans confession

  youll stay here the rancher planned
joe and the other three boys will go to
the bundy camp at witch-talk and wait
for me its getting dark right now and
no moon for trailing ill go to hemper
for more men tell the boys to search big
wash but to show no lights i should join
them before dawn tell them to scout
but to steer clear of a fight when i join
them well comb the country north to the
desert hills and guard the water-holes
ill send you word when we establish a main
camp

  norn secured his two made-to-order six-
shooters sweet weapons and perfectly bal-
anced and exchanged his saddle-gun for a
heavy hunting-rifle	

  the four men under desert jacks ordffrs-
were soon ready for the trail heavily armed
and prepared for any desert emergency

  norn mounted his spotted horse which
he reserved for long rides and racked down
the hemper road

  it was plain thought norn that hardy
knowing the girls wealth expected a heavy
ransom for the boy there could be no
other motive certainly the gambler would
not expect to win the girls favor by such
methods yet if the gang held the boy
hardy would be in a position to demand
almost any sacrifice of the lads sister
whatever his motive the gambler must be
placed under guard and held as hostage for
dickies safety

  to save the girl much unnecessary an-
guish as well as to avoid the reproach she
would surely heap upon him for his lax
guardianship of her brother norn decided
to exact a promise of silence from uncle
charlie until they had made every possible
effort to wrest dickie from the clutches of
the gang

  as norn rode into hemper he noted that
hardys saloon was ablaze with light but
that the hemper house was as dark as a
tomb he tossed the reins over the pintos
head and vaulted the rail at the end of the
porch immediately uncle charlie chal-
lenged him


adventure

  its norn-norn the rancher answered
impatiently open up

  uncle charlie admitted the rancher and
before norn could tell him of dickie the
old man began cursing the apache kid

  talk straight the rancher remon-
started calm yourself

  the landlord finally managed to give a
clear account of the events of the afternoon

  and he concluded the murderin
devil says hell take my girl south with him
in the mornin

  a white figure unseen by the men stole
down the stairway

  then said norn in a matter-of-fact
tone there is nothing left to do but stop
this apache kid

  thats it-thats it the old man eagerly
assented but a thought of the kids rec-
ord made him add nervously youll have
to use your head king the apache kid
is quicker than death itself i think wed
better try gettin the girl out of town
no norn firmly objected will you
let some cow-thief drive you to that

-tbut im old and slow groaned uncle
charlie lord man what can i do
stay here and stand guard ill take a
chance on the apache kid

  norn now thought to tell uncle charlie
of dickie but ere he could speak dora
glided over and touched his arm the
rancher whirled and the movement brought
him close to her

  you must not risk your life for me
she softly pleaded i overheard uncles
suggestion if you will assist me i can
escape dickie can follow later

  the rancher flinched inwardly when she
mentioned dickie but made no reply he
could not tell her of the danger that threat-
ened her brother and it was not his nature
to discuss a man he was soon to view
through gun-smoke

  his silence told her that her pleading had
been in vain her hands were now clutch-
ing both his arms must she make the final
appeal must she tell him that she had
more fear for his safety than for her own

  i do not want you to go she mur-
mured so faintly that he was forced to bend
his head and ask her to repeat the words

  i do not want you to go she repeated
and there was no mistaking the warm ten-
der note in her voice

  norns heart leaped madly he wanted
to sweep her to his breast to release the

pent-up flood of tenderness in his heart
but he held himself quiescent fearful that
she was laboring under a mere passing emo-
tion he so intensely desired her love
that he dared not show a glimmer of true
sentiment lest he meet with that indiffer-
ence that had wrecked the hopes of so many
men she must come to him calm and
unharrowed with emotion and give him the
sign that symboled her hearts desire he
would not pursue he would not babble
madly her love must flower naturally

  gently he drew away from her and started
toward the door

  oh she exclaimed desperately why
can you not see-

  see what he asked halting abruptly

  training pride the idea that the woman
must wait wait wait until the man speaks
held back the words she yearned to say-
three little words i love you

  then though her hands groped toward
him he backed swiftly through the door
and was gone

  norn did not forget that he was about to
battle with a first-class gunman and was
fully aware that the kid could under ordi-
nary conditions shade the gun-play of any
man in the desert country but he had
decided not to approach the killer under
ordinary conditions

  with feigned carelessness he approached
the swinging doors of the saloon and paused
for a breath to locate liis man he saw the
apache kid lounging against the wall in
the center of the saloon and even with the
kid stood the gaping sunshine staring at
the killer

  norn entered swiftly

  you sunshine he shouted with well-
feigned rage what do you mean by steal-
ing my horse

  poor sunshine stunned by the accusa-
tion and chilled with fear could only blink
and gape

  norn advanced a pace and pulled his
guns this movement caused the kid to
face the seemingly angry man and to drop
his hands on the butts of the low-hung
guns then realizing that it was not his
affair he relaxed pleasantly anticipating
bloodshed the killers hands dropped
away from his gun butts he took out his
book of cigaret-paper the fool had stolen
a horse and would soon die

  hardy was deeply puzzled why should
norn the silent and dignified stoop to
the survivor



frightening a town fool other watchers
grinned norn was merely indulging in a
little sport norn smiled bleakly yes
that was it the rancher was having a little
fun with sunshine even the kid saw
through the dramatic gun-play and frowned
disappointedly he had hoped to witness
a killing

  can you dance rasped norn say
you sunshine can you dance

  the big yokel essayed a few ox-like steps

  not fast enough yelled norn cocking
his guns

  the kid lounging against the wall
grinned at the clumsiness of sunshine the
fool was surely frightened out of what little
wits he possessed

  dance faster insisted norn then in
one swift sure movement he swung his
guns from sunshine to the kid and released
the smooth hammers

  in the infinitesimal fraction of a second
required for the lead to speed from the guns
to his body the kid caught norns cold
eye glittering across the gleaming barrels
automatically the killers hands sought
his guns but the lead shut off the nerve
connection between brain and hands ere
the fingers could close on the weapons

  the apache kid slumped against the
wall slid to a sitting posture and then
toppled over

  norn holstered one gun and leaped to
the side of the killer

  he rolled the body over with his foot and
pulled doras ring from the slim finger that
would never again circle a gun-butt

  sunshine as norns guns exploded gave
a good imitation of an insane kangaroo
he dodged and plunged and tossed his
arms and finally dived under a card-table
up he rose carrying the table with him
in a wild stampede for the back door
striking the door he fought the table for a
breath dropped it and gyrated like a
whirling dervish through the door in the
alley he launched himself forward and
striking barrels and boxes crashed through
them like a frenzied bull at last he got
clear of the obstructions and passed up the
alley in wild flight howling at every jump
he ran until exhausted and only slunk back
to the town when he had after much labo-
rious examination of his body assured him-
self that he was not mortally wounded

  hardy had been a puzzled spectator of
the baiting of sunshine but as norns guns

spoke and the kid slumped the audacious
generalship of the rancher stunned the
gambler who had been trying in vain to
think of some way to get the drop on the
kid he saw norn bend over the body
but the roulette-wheel prevented his seeing
the rancher strip the ring from the dead
mans finger then ere he could fathom
all the ranchers motives he found himself
staring into those same guns that had sent
the kid to his long sleep

  hands up norn ordered sharply

  the gambler read death in norns
glance and his hands shot ceilingward

the watchers did not interfere
though at that moment there were
many hardy partisans in the room
norn had killed the apache kid and no
one now dared to dispute his will

  norn holstered one gun and slipping
back of the gambler proceeded to disarm
him

  to the hotel norn ordered in a low
voice	

  the gambler feeling the pressure of a
gun-barrel against his spine marched as
ordered-across the street and on to the
hotel porch

  norn now proposed to tell uncle charlie
of the danger that threatened dickie and
turn hardy over to the old man as hostage
for the boy

  dora and her uncle had heard the shoot-
ing and were on the porch as hardy and
norn came up the girl could hardly re-
press the prayer of thankfulness that rose
to her lips she had heard the shots but
the intimate details of the passing of the
apache kid were not within the range of her
womans imagination she could only com-
prehend that norn was unhurt

  uncle charlie noted hardys raised hands
but asked no questions he held the buf-
falo gun at the ready and waited for norn
to speak

  to norn the ring symbolized his ability
to encircle the girl with his protection
holding a gun on hardy he fumbled in
hisshirt-pocket for the ring yet he re-
frained from even a hint of heroics and
quietly said-

  heres your ring miss dora

  the girls imagination then caught a
glimpse of the action required to take that
ring from the apache kid inwardly she
shuddered at the thought of taking that


adventure

which had encircled a dead mans finger
but the realization that the ring was a sym-
bol of norns willingness to risk his life in
her defense outweighed her qualms and she
stepped toward him hand outstretched
this move placed her even with hardy
whose right hand swiftly descended on her
shoulder and hurled her against norn

  in two bounds the desperate gambler had
reached the end of the porch and cleared the
rail uncle charlie slow and heavy swung
his sharpes but hardy had mounted
norns horse before the old man could get
the buffalo gun in action

  uncle charlie made a mighty effort to
reach the rail but crashed into a rocking-
chair and went down cursing and roaring
in some fashion the old sharpes was dis-
charged and the great slug whizzed across
the street passed through the front of the
saloon struck one of the big hanging lamps
passed through the back wall and then
through a covered wagon missing by a
hands-breadth the occupant thereof who
was sleeping off a days debauch

the mysterious shot created a panic in
the saloon and there followed a blind rush
for the doors the killing of the kid and
the forced departure of hardy had touched
the nerves of the habitues of the saloon
suspicion and old hates flamed up in the
mad scramble a half-intoxicated man
jerked out his gun and began firing the
chimneyless lamp blazed up and the sag-
ging cheesecloth ceiling caught fire the
fighting struggling men at both doors now
had no thought save to escape

  the jam at the front door finally broke
and its component parts separated and
lurched and stumbled into the street by
this time the fire had gained such headway
that those who had stampeded so blindly
from the inferno could only turn and
dumbly stare at the flames then it oc-
curred to one of the watchers that the
whole town might burn and he raised a wild
cry of fire fire eire this stirred the
paralyzed ones into activity and the
street was soon full of excited men rush-
ing hither and thither bawling conflicting
orders and acting not unlike a drove of
frantic cattle

  norn was near the edge of the porch
when hardy hurled the girl into his arms
one of her hands struck down his gun and
she fell heavily against him to save him-
self he staggered down the steps carrying

her with him before he could disengage
himself from her clutching hands and run
around the porch hardy was through
the cottonwoods and speeding toward the
desert

  the bedlam in the saloon following the
bellow of uncle charlies rifle checked
norn at the end of the porch he returned
to the girl to witness the stampede then
as the flames gained headway in the dry
shell he realized that he could not now
expect the men of hemper to join him in
the search for dickie the town was in
confusion and a posse friendly to him and
the landlord could not be raised until the
hemperites had regained some semblance
of calmness also uncle charlies account
of his unsuccessful attempt to enlist a vigi-
lance committee to dispose of the apache
kid indicated tliat the raising of a posse
to take the trail of the gang would be a
difficult matter even under normal condi-
tions

  uncle charlie having fought the rocker
to a draw began bellowing that the whole
street was doomed

  men came running with buckets and
made some attempt to save the saloon but
they soon fell back to concentrate their
efforts on the hotel side of the street

  uncle charlie summoned his help and
formed a small bucket brigade which kept
the front of the hotel drenched with water

  norn was loath to leave the girl while
the fire raged and waited until assured that
the hotel was safe as he watched the
fire he became aware of the girls close
presence and felt her hand slip into
his

   it was very foolish of me to accuse you
of deceiving poor little maria she hur-
riedly unburdened her heart fearful that
he would plunge into action before she
could voice her regret will you forgive
me

   i guess this side of the street is safe
now he observed pretending not to have
heard her

  yes i guess so she murmured for-
lornly and slowly withdrew her hand

  then uncle charlie came and insisted
that the girl seek the safe seclusion of the
indians cabin at the rear of the hotel

  when the old man had departed with
dora norn decided to postpone telling
him of dickie hardy was doubtless in
the desert now and when he heard of the
the survivor



destruction of his saloon would not
hesitate to recoup his loss by demanding a
staggering ransom for the boy the situa-
tion norn concluded called for immediate
action and he resolved to take the trail with
what men he had he would do all in his
power to recover the boy and if he failed
he would then send a man to town to sum-
mon aid by the time he and his men
now waiting at witch-talk had thoroughly
scouted the desert basin the friendly hem-
perites might be induced to listen to an
appeal for help

  norn found the proprietor of the hard-
ware store and quickly purchased a rifle
and ammunition at the stage stable the
rancher grumbled at the inferiority of the
horse he was forced to accept doubting
that the animal would last until he recov-
ered his faithful pinto

  cautiously norn rode into the desert
hardy might double back and ambush
him since the gambler had not only the
tireless pinto but the heavy hunting-rifie
left hanging on the saddle

 chapter xi

bundy as he began to reason
calmly realized that he could not
hope to reach hemper in time for
the doctor to save him from an agonizing
death he might however be able to get
to norns ranch but the problem was to
reach the ranch without being sighted by
the gang he knew that pete and his men
were now at twenty-eight palms and that
he could not slip past their camp before
dawn even if he turned the boy over to
the gang he could not escape the charge of
treachery they would instantly deduce
that it was the snake venom in his veins
that had brought him back to them and
no desire to play fair also no member of
the gang possessed any antidote for snake-
bite he had much to lose and nothing to
gain by returning to the gang

  despite the desperateness of his situa-
tion the mans mind was not solely occu-
pied with selfish thoughts vaguely it
now came to him that had he not been
bitten by the snake he would not have
carried out his program but would have
eventually taken dickie to the norn ranch
the lad had roused some latent parental
instinct in the man and he found himself
considering dickies welfare with a greater

concern that he accorded the ever-increasing
pain in his hand and arm

  with some difficulty he saddled the horses
and led the way up a tributary of the
canon finally coming out on the main
ridge of the desert range

  halting to adjust the tourniquet he told
dickie his plans

  well strike along this ridge till we come
to tunnel canon theres water at the
head of it and generally a hatful of water
in the old tunnel near the mouth well
then go on to norns ranch how you
feelin kid

  pretty good thank you dickie bravely
assured him though stiff and sore and ex-
hausted from the strain on his nerves

  game as they make em mumbled
bundy fighting back a curious drowsiness

  they moved on bundy found himself
bending over the saddle horn the ground
seemed a bed of black velvet that offered to
him heavenly repose only with the ut-
most effort could he hold himself erect in the
saddle he wanted to slump to surrender

  then came the strange sensation of his
body being attached to the arm instead of
the arm to the body the bodywas cold
and the arm aflame the body seemed
small and shriveled the arm huge and
bursting with blood

  then the drowsiness rushed his faculties
and he found himself seated on the ground
with dickie tugging at his shoulder and
whimpering

  you said you must get to a doctor or
youd die please dont die-please dont
die

  the man lurched to his feet and managed
to get into the saddle

  keep me movin son he mumbled
thickly keep me movin

  with the venom raging in his arm
bundys course up the ridge was erratic and
punctuated with frequent halts

  at times the fear of agonizing death
gripped the vitals of the man and he cursed
wildly to revive his sinking courage but
through his curses ran a thin note of despair

  we cant make it he blubbered and
almost fell from his horse

  the animal halted abruptly expecting
his rider to dismount

  bundy sprawled over the saddle horn and
slid to the ground

  go on he yelled hoarsely to the boy
who had quickly dismounted im done


adventure

  while bundy could stand hardship en-
dure hunger and thirst his mind could not
rise free and clear above the sljarp subtle
workings of the venom fatalistic thought
dominated him and threw wide the gates
of his physical being to the poison had he
firmly held to the idea that his blood was
clean and pure he would have no doubt
much lessened the pressure that aided the
venom on its work but he surrendered
his mind black with snake-thoughts poison-
thoughts death-thoughts his mind in-
vited the venom to do its worst and thus he
succumbed far more quickly than he would
had his every thought been against the idea
of surrender

  go on he repeated hopelessly im
done-mountain over there-go on-go
on

  dickie his childishness burned out by the
fires of harsh experience put his arms about
the man and strove to push him toward his
horse

 hurry panted the boy you are
very sick and must get to a doctor

  bundy sat down abruptly mumbling-

  no use-no use

  get up dickie screamed you told
me to keep you moving dont you see
im helping you-dont you understand

  but the man did not move

  the boy now realized that pleadings wrere
in vain he must keep the man moving-
but how perhaps insult would stir the
huge inert hulk before him he could
think of nothing but the small boy ana-
thema of-

cowardly cowardly custard

ate a cup of mustard

  this he shrilled close to bundys ear and
its effect was magical

  the boy was calling him a coward-a
small sickly boy was calling him rat
bundy leader of men a coward his mind
threw aside its black incubus of death-
thoughts what was a nip from a rattler
nothing he was strong and his blood
was pure he would survive he rose to
his feet jaws set and mounted his horse

  dickie never knew the terrible effort it
cost bundy to hold his mind to the thought
of survival the man now sat in his saddle
rigidly erect fighting battle after battle
against the insidious venom he was de-
termined now to reach the mouth of tunnel

canon from which point the boy could
plainly see the green fields of norns ranch

  noble thoughts for the boys safety
strengthened him he found that such
thoughts kept his mind clear and that
thoughts of self confused his sense of direc-
tion and weakened his resistance

  the tributary that led into tunnel canon
was clogged with cat-claws that forced
them to dismount and lead their horses

  the man holding firmly to the resolve
to guide the boy to safety floundered
through the implacable cat-claw oblivious
to its cruel hooked thorns but when they
entered tunnel canon the old thoughts
charged the citadel of his resolve and he
slumped down in the sand his shirt in
tatters his face hands and chest bleeding
from countless scratches dickie had fared
much better the man had broken a trail for
him

  the lad now saw that the man was again
losing courage and he repeated the small-
boy anathema which brought bundy to his
feet cursing himself for a spineless quitter
and once more he mounted his horse with
the venom singing a song of blind hate in his
veins

  tunnel canon though its walls were
abrupt was spacious and smooth-floored
the ponies racked on freely dickie leading
the way

  look fer tunnel-left-hand side bundy
warned not quite sure that he was in the
right canon

  then suddenly dickie discerned a black
blot in the canon wall and veered over a
little

  heres the tunnel he joyously ex-
claimed were all right now

  keep goin the man groaned as he
rode even with the boy keep goin

sspp there was now a pallid hint f
pidawn in the eastern sky the worn
and weary lad sniffed the aromatic
dawn-scents and felt his spirits revive
soon would come the kindly sunlight and
all would be well

  when they reached the mouth of tunnel
canon rain-maker had emerged from the
gloom and stood wreathed in shimmering
haze

  theres the ranch shouted dickie
see the trees and the house thats it-
thats it

  but the habit of resistance had now
the survivor



gained a foothold in the mind of the man
they were in sight of the ranch and there he
could at least secure whisky which was
supposed to counteract the effect of rattle-
snake venom he would fight his way
through the boy would not again have
to remind him that he was a coward

  he might have ridden on without a
break had he not thought to examine his
hand and arm in the clear morning light
the swelling gave his courage a severe set-
back he sagged forward and his horse
promptly halted he slid from the saddle
and stood his arms hanging over the horses
neck a hopeless sodden figure of despair

  come on please hurry dickie began
pleading

  theres the ranch bundy said mourn-
fully go to it im sick-sick-

  ill stay with you then the boy calmly
decided i wont leave you

  huh thought the man the kid was a real
friend who wouldnt leave him to die like a
poisoned wolf alone and forsaken the
boy was game and he a man was giving up
surrendering while he yet had strength
he managed to heave himself into the
saddle

  dickie led the way across big wash and
up to the ranch-house bundy now that
he had rcached the end of the terrible trail
slumped completely and would have fallen
from the horse had not desert jack caught
him in his strong arms

  he took me from some men and brought
me home quickly vouchsafed dickie true
to his promise then in answer to a
puzzled exclamation from desert jack
he excitedly poured forth a torrent of
words

  big rattlesnake bit him-i cut his
finger-then i sucked the blood out-then
he was going to die-and then-

  you look purty peaked yourself kid
interrupted the foreman as he beckoned
to pedro go to the house and lie
down

  dickie rode up to the porch and dis-
mounted now that he was free of all
responsibility weariness overpowered him
and it required a desperate effort for him to
reach the big divan in the living-room
there he sprawled out and fell into the
dreamless sleep of one who has fought a
good fight and won and to the end he
kept his pact with bundy

  with pedros assistance desert jack

half-carried bundy to the bunk-house
the foreman deeming whisky a sovereign
remedy for snakebite forced great swallows
of the raw liquor down bundys tliroat
then calling on the chinese servants for
assistance he bound up bundys hand
and arm in raw beef

  youd better hit fer town pedro
desert jack told the mexican when they
had finished poulticing bundys arm get
doc cunningham out here on the jump

  then the foreman thought of norns
orders the rancher would hold him re-
sponsible for any treachery on the mexicans
part but pedro was the only available
man a chinese could not be trusted
away from a house also the boy was
safe and the holding of pedro now was of no
importance

  as the mexican turned to go desert jack
warned him that a quick killin would be
the reward fer any greaser tricks

  the foreman stood in the doorway of the
bunk-house rifle in hand and watched the
mexican depart then he returned to the
pouring of whisky down the throat of the
hapless bundy

  bundy in his way had always been far
more considerate of the mexicans feelings
than had pete or any of the other desert
rovers who classified greasers with
indians and negroes the mexican was
not a stranger to gratitude

  desert jacks warning was unnecessary
in his heart of hearts the mexican was
weary of the rather lonely life his color had
forced him to lead he was a member of
the gang but none of the white men
barring bundy had ever shown him a
gleam of kindness or counseled with him
he would slip into hemper find the doctor
and then flee north far beyond the gangs
reach in sweet san gabriel he would find
his own people a guitar to strum and a
dark-eyed woman to make time pass quickly
aye he was fortunate to escape from the
hated gringos the ever-restless ones the
seekers of trouble

  though he gave a grunt of astonishment
at the havoc the fire had wrought pedro as
he entered hemper did not pause to inspect
the smoking ruins but trotted past the
hotel intent on reaching the doctors office
he reined in abruptly as he caught a glimpse
of the doctor coming out of the drug-store
and hailed the medico just as he paused at
the hotel steps to speak to dora


adventure

  bundy heem get snakebite you go
queek norn ranch

  all right snapped the doctor ill
start right away

  the mexican having paid his debt of
gratitude to bundy galloped around the
hotel and the desert country knew him no
more

  pedros display of graceful horsmanship
as he dashed past attracted uie girls atten-
tion and she vaguely recalled fragments of
his speech to the doctor

  snakebite-norn ranch

  some men poking in the ashes of the
ruins shouted to the doctor as he past
sped in his buckboard

  then the thought that dickie might have
been bitten by a rattlesnake plunged into
her mind with terrifying suddenness the
doctor was now beyond hailing distance
and she ran into the hotel to tell uncle
charlie of her fears

  while dora had slept a few hours the old
man had guarded his property all night
with no thought of sleep now he was pre-
paring to give his old body the rest it de-
manded and was in no mood to be alarmed
by unfounded forebodings

  dont be foolish dora he grumbled as
he tugged at his shoes if dickie was bit
theyd bring him in on the jump you
dont suppose that doc cunningham
wouldnt tell you if it was the boy that was
nipped i swear dora youre like most
wimmin-always a-borrowin trouble holy
cripes i never put in such a night in my
life now run along and let me sleep
but uncle she persisted it might be
dickie you know he is so daring and
impetuous

  well doc cunningham ought to be
back in a few hours and then youll know
now let me sleep

  slowly dora returned to the porch an
hour dragged by and then she saw one of the
stage stable helpers start up the street

  bring my horse please she called to
the helper and hurried upstairs to don her
riding-habit

  later as she cantered down the desert
road she amused herself with picturing
dickies surprise when she rode up to the
ranch her forebodings she now realized
had arisen from loneliness dickie had
been gone a long time it seemed to her and
she was merely lonesome

  the lad would have many stories to tell

her and norn would bring them back to

town

  hers was a mind that rarely long enter-
tained disagreeable thoughts or memories
she was on her way to dickie now
and would doubtless see the man she
loved

  also she had a good feminine excuse for
invading norns little empire she would
tell him calmly and without the quiver of
an eyelash she had heard that some one at
the ranch had been bitten by a snake and
that she had come to make sure the unfortu-
nate was not dickie then norn would
show her the ranch and in the quiet balmy
evening they would return to town

  she admitted a childish curiosity re-
garding the mans surroundings and manner
of living did he possess all those things of
which uncle charlie had hinted books rich
furniture piano and servants

  now that she loved a man she found she
could not reason calmly and lucidly her
mind toyed with pleasant externals and
refused to consider primitive facts

  the apache kid hardy the fire were
now vague memories falling back into the
shadows of obscurity before the irresistible
advance of love and hope

she was in the springtime of youth
the day was matchless and her
powerful horse was bearing her
swiftly to her twin loves

  of course the man had never spoken a
word of love to her but that did not matter
he might resist for a time but would
finally bow as she had bowed to the im-
mutable law she smiled as she thought of
any man attempting to resist the law of
love-the law that governed the universe

  she surrendered to tender thoughts of
norn what a restless being he was ever
in action yet all his deeds sprang from
his great unselfishness he had no thought
of self no small bickering egotism no desire
to parade his masculinity he was as
clean as a pine on the mountain top and as
sound and as strong the love of such a
man was worth any effort any sacrifice

  in time they would come to an intimate
understanding with none of the commonal-
ities and jealousies that marked the average
love they would go through life   

  here she paused in her dreaming and
laughed at herself surely she was taking
a great deal for granted she was building
the survivor



a beautiful air-castle that might fall with a
crash and bury her heart and its hopes

  a lean prospector overtook her but did
not attempt that bland smirking the average
male imagines paves the way to womans
favor he recognized her as the woman
for whom king norn had shot the apache
kid thus to him norns protection
walked before her a deadly menacing
shadow that warned

  for this woman i killed the killer of
twenty pause at your peril

  the prospector did not pause he
circled around her eyes to the front and
passed on omitting even the conven-
tional howdy maam

  the girl marveled a little at the mans
actions heretofore every man she had
met on her rides had volunteered much in-
formation concerning the weather and the
country and had favored her with wide
bland smiles

  presently she discerned a man approach-
ing he was belaboring a couple of burros
then as he saw her he turned the burro
from the road and pretended to be occupied
with straightening the packs she recog-
nized him as the shaggy raconteur who had
once sought to entertain her on the hotel
porch he did not look up as she passed
the other prospector had given him a
hurried account of the passing of the apache
kid the shaggy one heaved a sigh of re-
lief as she passed not for a panful of
nuggets would he have accosted her how-
ever harmless his greeting it might be mis-
construed and he proposed not to toy with
chance

  she met the westbound stage whose
driver and passengers had been fully posted
by the lean prospector the driver touched
his hat but the passengers of the coach sat
tight and refrained from the usual road
pleasantries

  dora was familiar with the main road
but had never ventured to explore the branch
that led to norns ranch but she antici-
pated no difficulty there was rain-maker
and the ranch lay in the lap of the mountain

  she turned into the ranch road confident
and happy dreamily she watched the
lizards speed through the sandy aisles be-
tween the greasewood and squat burro
weed she smiled at an inquisitive jack-
rabbit that raised up and stared at her with
round foolish eyes the sunlight redly illumi-
nating his thin ears

  the sweep and majesty of the mountain-
guarded desert intensified the naive sim-
plicity of thought that now seemed so
delightful to her all that cultivated re-
serve that chill aloof attitude of the specta-
tor those experiences with strutting mas-
culine egoes had faded into remoteness
she felt the kinship of nature and her
childhood called to her with a sweet insis-
tent voice she noted some stones set in
orderly fashion by the roadside and re-
called the play-houses built of sticks and
stones in the long ago she was tempted to
dismount and again build a play-house of
sticks and stones love demands natural-
ness and will have none of the artificial
none of the cold wisdom of experience
therefore children attract love with little
or no effort and when grown-ups come
under its spell they too see through the
eyes of children

  the girl recalled slipping her hand into
norns with no regret for her vanished
pride it had been a perfectly natural
move she would do it again she sliamelessly
admitted if he gave her an opportunity

  presently she came to a fork of the ranch
road that momentarily puzzled her she
decided to take the road most plainly
marked with evidences of recent travel a
freight outfit bound for the mines beyond
the desert hills had left broad wagon
tracks and the thick imprint of many hoofs
she rode on following the broad track of
the freight wagons she noted that the
road veered slightly from the mountain but
was confident that it would soon turn
toward rain-maker

  desert atmosphere and distances are
deceiving it now seemed to the girl that
she was approaching the mountain in
reality she was headed for a pass in the
desert hills between norns ranch and
tunnel canon she had not the faintest
conception of the vast proportions of the
mountain there it was apparently direct-
ly in front of her she crossed big wash
and rode on steadily toward the pass

  when a short distance from the mouth of
tunnel canon she glanced to the left and
glimpsed the buildings and the trees of the
norn ranch she was about to turn from
the road when she discerned a number of
riders approaching from the direction of
tiie great wash she had crossed they were
not riding in a compact group but were
spread out in a long line whose left flank
o

adventure

intervened between her and the ranch
some intuitive sense of danger prompted
her to turn toward the mouth of tunnel
canon

  immediately the riders changed their
course proving to her that she was the
quarry they were seeking the panic of
the hunted overwhelmed her and she
galloped recklessly to the foot of the ridge
whose eroded and crumbling side formed
the far wall of the canon a fearful back-
ward glance convinced her that they were
closing in on her frantically she urged her
horse up the slope of the ridge then as
she again glanced back she glimpsed a
spotted horse she pulled in abruptly and
laughed weakly how foolish she had
been to give way to such an unreasonable
panic norn always rode a spotted horse
and here he was with his cowboys trying to
overtake her and give her safe conduct to
his ranch

  but was it norn something unfamiliar
in the riding of the man on the pinto checked
the natural impulse to ride down the slope
to meet them the rider on the spotted
horse lacked norns easy grace and daring
she saw him ride around boulders over
which the other riders leaped their horses

  suddenly two riders broke from the ad-
vancing line and raced into the mouth of the
canon the other riders swung to the
right to intercept her should she attempt
to dash into the adjoining canon these
were plainly hostile tactics surely norn
would not order his men to surround her
simply to guide her to the ranch

  she looked about her desperately and
then sent her horse into a plunging gallop
up the ridge the crack of a rifle slapped
the silence of the canon and the whine of a
warning bullet made her gasp and abruptly
halt she could hear the shouts and curses
of her pursuers as they struck the foot of the
ridge she was trapped

chapter xii

       as the pinto carried him into the
desert the gambler groped through
a mental fog for some plan that if
properly set in action would remove king
norn from the world and leave chance
hardy free to follow his desires but in-
variably every thoughr-trail led back to tht
one impregnable fact the killing of the
apache kid and the method thereof

norns use of sunshine as a diversion from
the main attack proved him a thinker and
the gambler primitive led by emotions
dealing only with ignorant men inwardly
cringed at the thought of meeting a gun-
master who possessed not only a superior
body but a mind to plan to peer into the
future to make deductions and that
meeting if he remained in the hemper
territory was inevitable

  for hours he bitterly recalled he had
watched the kid hungering for the gun-
fighters life many times with compara-
tive safety he might have emptied the shot-
gun into the killers body but had been
held back by a nameless dread enter
then king norn the thinker to destroy the
kid with a little plan at that inevitable
meeting might not the thinker once more
put forth a little plan of which the kernel
thereof was death for chance hardy

  and back of it all was the woman what
a thick-headed fool he had been not to see
that king norn had been his principal rival
from the day of the girls arrival in hemper
inwardly he writhed as he realised how
norn had permitted him to clear away the
human trash around the woman norn
had watched him intimidate the little
preacher the doctor the men who shrank
back from danger the weaklings and the
riff-raff of the town

  men like bundy and brown requiring
special treatment had been honored with
norns personal attention the man dealt
not only in little plans but in great plans
made up of many little plans even the
killing of billy snake was a plan that
warned all men that those who rested in the
shadow of king norns friendship held the
right to call on his hearts blood for their
protection

  and back of it all was the woman the
gambler possessed the imagination that is
rooted in emotion and desire and he vis-
ioned her warm glowing beauty but
before her rose an ominous figure alert
terrible and with an eye reflecting lightning
thought

  norn he muttered bending low over
the saddle horn norn

  the woman seats herself in a luxurious
chair and looks out on the world of men
in her face is a maddening unfathomable
mystery an indifferent smile plays about
her scarlet lips and in her eyes dwells a lure
that draws eager fools to their doom
the survivor



  bundy with his drunken leer swaggers
up and the ominous terrible figure trans-
forms him into a battered bloody cowering
wretch brown the soft and fat mouthing
large words approaches with airy gallantry
only to be transformed into a sodden thing
bawling for water other men fall back
into the shadow then the apache kid
the killer of twenty presses forward and
in a flash becomes an inert piece of clay
and then many men fall back into the
shadow now another presses forward-
chance hardy

  the ominous terrible figure seems to pro-
ject from his eyes two fine wires that con-
verge in the heart of chance hardy the
guns flash and two bullets follow the fine
wires into the heart it is finished the
ominous terrible figure turns and extends a
hand to the girl - she rises and gives him a
smile of sweet surrender and slowly they
fade fade fade

  the gambler cursed and jerked himself
back into reality he now plainly saw that
there was only one course left for him to
follow and that led to pete and his men
under whose protection a campaign against
the rancher might be safely planned
norns actions indicated that he had either
foiled an attempt to capture the boy
or knew that the gang now held the
lad

  norn doubtless was trailing him now for
the rancher was conceded to be a wizard
in the desert hardy hauled the heavy
rifle from its scabbard pulled in the pinto
and listened suddenly he noted an omi-
nous glare in the sky over hemper fire
the town was burning his saloon would
be destroyed the old safe would probably
be looted as soon as it cooled

  the glare increased in intensity and
mounted higher the gambler groaned
the town was doomed

 then he realized that he was wasting
time norn would not let the burning of
hemper swerve him from his course the
rancher knew the desert intimately every
trail every cut-off every water-hole no
he must not think of returning to town
norn would surely ambush him

  though the gambler was a town man he
was familiar with the camps of the gang
he knew that twenty-eight palms was
closer to the norn ranch than the witch-
talk camp and that the gang would in all
probability choose the former camp for

their headquarters while lurking about the
norn ranch

  he followed the ranch road until the loom
of rain-maker warned him that he was
nearing the north side of the basin turn-
ing from the road he cut across country
progress now was slow his had been a
soft life and he found it difficult to hold his
courage in that gray waste he entered
big wash and was forced to ride far to the
south before he could find an exit from the
great sunken way the sun was above the
horizon before he glimpsed twenty-eight
palms

  pete snatched up a pair of battered field-

glasses

  holy smoke he ejaculated its hardy
ridin norns painted hawse

  hardy as he approached the camp de-
cided to withhold nothing from the gang
he was riding norns horse and they would
demand an explanation he woidd put
them on the defensive convince them their
safety lay in unity

  as he dismounted beneath the palms the
rovers gathered about him

  you didnt get the boy i see observed
the gambler with a dark glance at pete

  not yet that worthy returned optim-
istically but well pick him up in a day or
two but what you doin with norns
hawse

  norn killed the apache kid in my place
last night the kid took a ring from miss
wayne and norn come in and put up a
play against sunshine and then beefed the
kid then he throws his guns on me and
cleans me and then takes me over to the
hotel there i broke away jumped his
pinto and here i be you bungled the
deal somewhere pete norn must know
were after the boy

  but pete and his men were not impressed
by the accusation with which hardy finished
his account they considered only the red
fact of norn having killed the apache kid
hardys importance his power his ability
to reward shrank to proportions pitifully
small and insignificant

  pete the far-sighted voiced the general
sentiment when he grumbled

  you sure have fixed your own funeral
paws off for me if norns on your trail
then with a calculating look bring any
money with you

 why no faltered hardy how
could i


adventure

  thats right mused pete dryly you
couldnt gather it on the run

the gambler flushed darkly at the
insult and forced a smile that failed
to deceive even the dullest of the
rovers

  pete hooked his thumbs in his belt and
insolently looked the gambler up and down

  now that weve bungled the game as
you say whats your next move if norn
knows were after the boy he haint likely
to leave him hangin on a tree for us the
chances are he took him to town with him
and got him hid away safe and by this
time hes in the desert with a bunch of
men

  no i dont think that hardy soothed
i looked back and the sky was all lit up
looked like the town was burnin if it
was norn couldnt get men to leave-

  well then pete cut in quickly that
means your place is gone you wont be in
shape to deliver the money

  oh yes i will the gambler hastily
assured him ive got it in a los angeles
bank

  thats what you say muttered pete
and drew back to confer with his men

  the gambler shivered inwardly as he
noted that he was debarred from the
council they were treating him as they
would an outsider

  presently pete returned

  the boys dont jes like this deal as it
stands now he said slowly at the
start they was willin to take your word but
now they want to see the color of your
money before they go ahead theyre
thinkin of old man norn and the old bunch
he wiped out they was willin enough to
pick up the boy and hold him for you but
they dont want open war with king norn
if you want any kind of action now youd
better slip into town and drag back some
dinero the sight of real money might stir
the boys up a little

  in petes attitude was a thinly-veiled
insolence hardy to the raw-boned desert
rover was now a has-been who had
taken cover like a coyote pete knew that
money alone could not hold a man erect in
t lie desert country to survive he must have
the power to chill the hearts of men with
fear removed from his saloon with its
glittering display of bottles its roulette-
wheel and faro lay-out the gambler seemed

an insignificant man certainly with his
white hands and soft body he was unfit to
cope with the bronzed lean desert rovers
he had ruled them pete now saw through
their desires and not through any natural
strength of character whisky and gam-
bling had been the sources of his power
he had done nothing suffered no hardships
yet he had used them to gather money for
him they had been the peons and hethe
lordly don

  the dominant qualities that pete
thcough policy had held under cover now
sprang up virile hard and not to be de-
nied contemptuously he regarded the
man who had once ruled him sneering a lit-
tle at the fine boots the white vest and the
dazzling watch-chain a few days in the
desert and the fine boots would be in tat-
ters the white vest soiled and greasy and
the smooth hands blistered and sore

  lower and yet lower sank the gambler in
petes estimation by long rides by sweat
and toil he and his sort had kept hardys
hands white and had made it possible for
him to wear fine clothes and sport dazzling
watch-chains

  even now hardy was attempting to use
him to secure a woman why serve him
further since norn had stripped the
mask from his face the card-sharp was not
tp be feared

  hardy in a desperate effort to regain his
prestige sought to address the gang but
pete viciously checked him

  dont start no talk with the bunch
warned the lean leader the muscles around
his eyes twitching if you got anything to
say say it to me

  curbing his rage as best he could the
gambler forced himself to speak in regretful
tones

  pete ive been on the square ive
told you all i might have come out here
and kept a lot of stuff under cover but i laid
every card on the table do you think that
is the way to treat a man who plays a square
game with you you agreed to get the
boy take so much money and ask no ques-
tions i didnt think and i dont think
now that you or any of the boys would
kick out on the given word

  the little earnest speech impressed the
gang even pete was moved by it

  i could have said hardy went on
that norn loaned me his pinto but j
didnt i told you the facts he got the
the survivor



drop on me but that dont mean he is goin
to run me out of this country

  suddenly he turned to the gang

  is there a man among you that ever
come to me for a dollar or any kind of help
and didnt get it

  the answer was a chorus of negative
grunts

  then to pete

  lets get the boy now hes the high
card when you hold him norn cant
do a thing

  why cant he pete sharply ques-
tioned whats to hinder him

  he wouldnt want the kid hurt the
gambler said smoothly

  maybe so pete grumbled doubtfully
and squinted up at the sun

  wed better be movin hardy meekly
suggested its toward noon now

  but pete took his own time in getting the
gang on the trail there were the horses to
bring in and water and pete found that he
had to mend his saddle before he could
proceed

  hardy inwardly fretted and fumed but
made no effort to hurry the men his posi-
tion was too precarious for any display of
dictatorialness

  it was an hour past noon before they
mounted and rode slowly toward the norn
ranch

  well go over and have a look around
pete hedged maybe pedro will have
something to tell us i sent him into norns
canon

 wheres bundy hardy suddenly
queried

  watchin big wash near the camp
pete replied indifferently  that gives him
somethin to do and hes not in the way

  the gambler made no comment though
a vague suspicion regarding bundys mo-
tive in consenting to remain near the witch-
talk camp flitted through his mind

norn in the meantime had
joined his men at the foot of witch-
talk and had struck dickies trail
leading from the camp

  the tracks of the shod pony were not
difficult to follow and they soon came to the
canon into which bundy had led the boy

  norn discovered the dead rattler in the
little camp at the head of the canon and
carefully inspected the body of the snake
and the tracks around it

  looks like it had been shot and then
trampled he muttered a man doesnt
trample a big snake unless it has bitten
him

  closely he exmained the boys tracks
and the impression of the lads body in the
sand at  time had the snake been
within striking distance of the boy

 i think the man was bitten the
rancher concluded as he straightened up
if hes carrying venom his trail will be
short

  norn led the way out of the canon and up
the slope of the main ridge of the desert
range there just before they struck hard
and rocky ground they discovered that the
man had dismounted and leaned against his
horse

  this surely indicates that something is
wrong norn reasoned as he traced out
the tracks with his forefinger the tracks
are far apart and he evidently threw his
whole weight on his heels hes either sick
or carrying snake venom

  they rode up to the crest of the ridge but
the ground hard as flint gave up no trail-
signs

  norn decided to send his men south to
the nearest water-hole

  if you strike his trail at the water-
hole stick to it he ordered but in case
you dont drift back to the ranch by cir-
cling to the north ill cover the country
back to rain-maker

  the rancher rode slowly north dismount-
ing at times to closely scrutinize the ground
in a few hours his patience was rewarded
he discovered the faint impression of a
horseshoe he walked in ever-widening
circles until he struck the trail leading down
from the ridge into a tributary of tunnel
canon

  the trail now was as plain as a wa-
gon road the little sandy places be-
tween the boulders were as wax to hold the
imprints of hoof and foot

  when he came into the main canon he
found a group of tracks indicating a halt
apparently the boy now in the lead had
dismounted and returned to the man the
man was surely sick or hurt for the tracks
of the boy indicated that he had attempted
to move the man they were evidently
headed for the ranch with the horse fol-
lowing him like a dog the rancher stole
down the canon alert watchful rifle at the
ready

adventure

pfh pete was the first to sight the
gg woman hardy noticed his excite-
ment and then a man back of them
called out-

  that looks like a woman ridin a light
hawse

   wheres your field-glasses the gambler
yelled at pete forgetful of norn the boy
and lost prestige

  pete signaled halt to the men and
with a curious side-glance at hardy pro-
duced the field-glasses hardy frantically
grabbed for the glasses but pete swung
them out of his reach

   dont be in such a rush he coldly ad-
vised and gave the gambler such a malevo-
lent glance that the latter recoiled as from a
sudden lick of flame

  what pete saw through the glasses trans-
formed the habitual hard set expression of
his face into one of bland and eager interest
he even smiled reminiscently

   its her he said softly as he lowered
the glasses uncle charlies niece

  as he gave the glasses to hardy and
noted the gamblers eagerness petes face
resumed its old set expression though a
slight twitching of the corners of his hard
mouth betrayed some violent inner
agitation

  the magic glasses brought the girl full
into the gamblers vision long he gazed
while the horses moved restlessly and the
men muttered vague comments and glanced
at one another furtively

   yes its her hardy exulted reluctant-
ly returning the glasses to pete

  pete slowly replaced the glasses in the
worn case

  i dont reckon- he raised the flap of
the saddle-bag and dropped the glasses into
the leather pocket-we need bother-
his fingers fumbled the buckle- about the
boy now

  irritated at petes slothfulness and ap-
parent waning interest in the whole affair
the gambler burst out impatiently

  sure the boy dcjnt count now come
on youll get your money just the same

   he started to urge the pinto forward but
pete raised a detaining hand

  hold on dont be in such a rush
lets talk business

  but shes gettin away from us ex-
postulated hardy were losin time
what do you mean by business

  pete glanced back at the gang and smiled

grimly then he made a suggestive move-
ment with his thumb and forefinger the
money sign

  what do you want snapped the
gambler

  you keep your money in a los angeles
bank pete quietly replied i want your
check for twenty thousand dollars ill
make the divvy among the boys got a
pencil

  for a moment hardy considered the new
proposition twenty thousand dollars was
a lot of money but small change compared
to the wealth of dora wayne and there
was the irresistible magnet of her beauty
also in the event that pete attempted any
crookedness he could stop payment on the
check

  hastily he filled in the check and passed
the slip of paper to pete who immediately
passed it back to the gang for inspection
and approval

  taint like real money complained the
hook-nosed man as he returned the check to
pete but if you say its o k thats good
enough for me youll get the coin and
divvy will you

  thats the idee exactly pete assured
him we get the coin and chance gets the
girl come on

  they spurred their horses into a gallop
and plunged down the bank of big wash
some of them tobogganing their horses down
the steep declivity on the hard floor of
the wash they raced northward like jockeys
leaving the post

  pete contemplated no involved plot to
secure the girl for himself he would pick
a quarrel with hardy after the girl was
captured kill him and thus prove to the
gang that his will was not to be disputed
there were various channels through which
the check might be cashed and hardy
would not be alive to stop payment to
bind the rovers closer to him he would
divide his share of the money among them

  hardys only thought now was to sccure
the girl norn was a vague memory the
beauty of the woman called to him with in-
sistent sweetness this was the hour for
which he had yearned for which he had
plotted through gray days and black nights
she would soon be his to have and to
hold

  as they dashed from the cover of the
wash hardy shouted with an odd wild
anxiety
the survivor



  i dont want her hurt pete under-
stand she mustnt be hurt handle her
easy

  the gambler saw petes lips move but
caught only a faint mumble above the
thump of hoofs and the crackle of brush

  petes reply had the gambler heard it
might have aroused his suspicions by its
cryptic accentuations

  dont you worry she wont be hurt

they saw the girl urge her horse
up the ridge and at this point pete
detached the two riders who raced
forward into the canon to halt the fleeing
woman with warning shots then they
obliqued and swept up to the foot of the
ridge

  at the first warning shot they pulled in

 come on yelled hardy shes
stopped come on dont you see theyve
stopped her

  two more shots in quick succession made
pete frown puzzledly and hardy curse
wildly

  then the gang roared its surprise as the
girl whirled her horse and plunged down the
slide of gravel and boulders that formed the
wall of the canon as she disappeared
pete turned his horse and galloped toward
the mouth of the canon hardy and the
gang straggled after him

  pete pulled his horse back on its haunches
as one of the detached riders broke from the
mouth of the canon the man was swaying
drunkenly and would have fallen from the
saddle but for petes steadying hand

 somebody-one man-got poor abe
coughed the rider and took the girl in the
tunnel got me through the lungs

  his breath came in short whistles and
blood welled from his mouth

  the gang came up and two men eased the
wounded man to the ground

  somebody got abe and done up bill
there pete snarled to rouse the blood
lust of the gang whoever he is hes in
the tunnel with the girl shall we throw
down our hands now and let him have her

  no came the roaring chorus get liim
-get him

  everybody take cover ordered pete
dismounting and jerking his saddle-gun
from the scabbard well creep up and
have a look at the hole of that lone wolf

  a man placed a canteen of water within
reach of the wounded bill they crept

forward from boulder to boulder from
bush to bush until they came to a smooth
barren stretch of sand on which lay the
crumpled body of the luckless abe be-
yond die dead man stood his horse facing
two horses not far from the black slot they
knew to be the tunnels mouth

  cautiously pete raised up his sharp eyes
searching for some coign of vantage from
which lead could be sent straight into the
tunnel but the outlook for a long-dis-
tance attack was most discouraging

  facing the tunnel was a long smooth
barren slope offering no shelter at the
first visible bend in the canon rose a jagged
mass of quartz this offered shelter but
the lead would thud harmlessly against
the wall of the tunnel which had been driven
into another upheaval of a mighty ledge
that diagonaled across the canon beneath
the sand floor

  theres no use to figger on settin back
and smokin em out hardy remon-
strated feverishly somebody might come
along and carry word to hemper and norn
might come in on us from the south day-
lights goin too i tell you we got to
rush em and wind it up quick

  if youre in such a hurry be you ready
to take the lead

  petes sneering query held a cold
challenge

  hardy was silent the lean desert
rover gave him a contemptuous glance and

clicked-

  all right well rush em

  pete drew his men back and proceeded to
give them the plan of attack

  first well injun file until we- come to
the wall of rock then well bunch up and
rush the mouth of the tunnel the girl will
be in the cross-cut and the man will probly
be flat again the near wall we must try
and not get in each others way i thought
of callin to him to give up but dont think
that would be much use he got poor abe
and old bill is about done for and he
probly reckons on stayin to the finish
why not divide and rush both sides
hard suggested

  that would mean too much of a mix-up
at the mouth o the tunnel pete objected
no well rush em from this side

  i dont like tiie looks o this whined
the hook-nosed man that feller in the
tunnel is a bad hombre he got two of us
he may get some more


adventure

  petes lip curled back over his teeth and
he forced himself into an awe-inspiring
rage

 upon the hook-nosed man he heaped
every vile epithet known to the border

 you limber-jawed rotten-hearted
coyote you lousy son of a squaw were
the mildest of his smoking denunciations
are you afraid of one man and a bawlin
woman he spat forth as though the words
burned his lips you leavins of the scum o
hell

  the hook-nosed one seemed to shrink to
grow smaller to wither under the blast of
sizzling words he made a vague gesture
of submission to fate and pete suddenly
turned to the gang and swept them with his
verbal fire

  if any of you are scared to foller a man
go back to your hawses and ill take that
holed-up wolf alone whos the first
quitter

  a savage roar answered him and lest
they lose courage and fail him at the last
moment he bawled come on boys and
ran toward the slope down which doras
horse had plunged

  for a moment they hesitated and then
charged after him growling and cursing
working themselves into a blind rage
hardy was the last man to follow and as
pete reached the wall of rock he flung a
baleful glance at the man who took the
minimum risk

  they hugged the wall of rock until within
a few paces of the mouth of the tunnel at
a signal from pete the file of men coalesced
into a frenzied struggling mass that surged
to and fro for a breath and then rolled into
die black mouth of the tunnel

chapter xiii

norns actions as he turned
the bend in the canon and recognized
dora were swift and sure as the
leading rider fired the warning shot norn
caught him fairly in the notch of the sight
and pulled the trigger a fleeting glimpse
of a frantic horse kicking free of a dead
man and then the second rider in the notch
of the sight a quick pressure of the trig-
ger and the second rider clawed at his sad-
dle horn lost control of his horse recov-
ered and finally turned and galloped in an
erratic course from the canon

norn ran down the canon shouting the

girls name and halted a few yards beyond
the tunnel

  its norn he called and beckoned
imperatively

  she hesitated to dare the steep slope and
then with a quick intake of breath whirled
her horse and urged him down the decliv-
ity the animal slid down almost on his
haunches but lost his footing as he struck
the floor of the canon dora sprang free
of the floundering horse and into the circle
of norns free arm

  he half-carried her into the tunnel
scuffing tentatively for rattlesnakes he
guided her to the end wall of the left branch
of the crosscut and took up a position back
of the opposite angle

  youre safe in here he answered her
peering around the angle at the mouth of
the tunnel whatever comes do not
move

  i was so worried about dickie cried
the girl forgetful of the danger that threat-
ened her a mexican came in and told
the doctor that some one at your ranch had
been bitten by a rattlesnake i kept think-
ing that it might be dickie-

  no harm has come to dickie norn
happily interrupted piecing together the
evidence he had gathered on the trail

  the rancher knew that desert jack
would not release tlie mexican unless
dickie had returned to the ranch the
man who had taken dickie into the desert
hills was playing a lone hand bitten by
the rattler he had been forced to seek the
ranch the boy was safe and unhurt he
heaved a sigh of relief the gang had
failed to capture the boy it was now a
matter of straight fighting

  counting hardy the gang could not
muster more than ten men and he had ac-
counted for two then there was the mexi-
can and the man with dickie six men to
face and his father had with the support
of two cowboys wiped out a bakers dozen
of the old gang if they attacked the tun-
nel before dark he was confident he could
give them each such a hot reception that the
survivors would give up the fight

  if they attempted a night attack he
would have much in his favor coming in
from the gray gloom into the pitch-dark
tunnel they would for several vital sec-
onds be at a disadvantage he could prob-
ably empty the magazine of his repeater
before it became necessary to leave the
the survivor



shelter of the angle and for the girls sake
carry the fight to them

  if they merely besieged the tunnel he
would creep out before daylight and gain
the shelter of the rocky crest above the
tunnel from that point with the coming
of daylight he would make the stakes of
death so high that his enemies would be
glad to get out of the game

  again he thought of hardy and abruptly
queried-

  did you see a man on a spotted horse

  yes she answered and the rancher
smiled approval of her calm even tones i
thought at first it was you and was about
to turn back then with intense eager-
ness cant i do something in case they
attack us i can use a revolver

  her gameness forged another link in the
chain of love she was no sniveling whin-
ing helpless creature she was all that his
heart desired and somehow some way he
would survive and shield her from all harm

  you can help me more by keeping out of
harms way he said gently if they
come keep close to the wall and do not
move it will soon-

  norn never finished that sentence with
appalling suddenness the mbuth of the tun-
nel darkened with struggling men the
taller ones bumping their heads against the
roof

  the blast from norns rifle in that hole
in a rock was like the long roar of a titan
through a great megaphone the heart-
shaking bang of six shooters the zunk of
lead against the wall and the rifles blast
reduced the curses grunts and groans to a
hideous monotone

  norns first shot ripped open the jugular
vein of a wild rover and plowed a red fur-
row across the brows of a man back of him
down went he of the torn jugular spout-
ing blood under the heedless heels of the
gang the man with the red furrow across
his brows whirled and stumbled blindly
from the tunnel bawling for help he fin-
ally found his horse and fled

  norn was now only a few feet from them
they had only to rush forward and seize
him but the unending blast of his rifle
was as a fiery wall of death between them
and their mad desires

  the leg of the hook-nosed man was shat-
tered and he fell as though he had inad-
vertently stepped into a hole yet he was
of a tough breed and sprawling he man-

aged to raise his six-shooter him norn
killed then sent two bullets into pete and
slightly wounded the man next to him

  the rancher dropped his rifle drew his
six-shooter and leaped into the tunnel
the slightly wounded man put a bullet in
his shoulder paralyzing the arm pete
dying on his feet sent three bullets into
norns body breaking a rib inflicting a
severe flesh wound in the thigh and rip-
ping a long diagonal slash across the chest
norn shot the slightly wounded man in the
mouth and that left alive pete and
hardy the latter unscathed

  the gambler had hugged the side of the
tunnel close to the mouth striving to get
in action the heavy rifle he had found on
norns saddle now the gambler pulled
the trigger and the bullet grazed the side of
the ranchers head norn pitched against
the wall of the tunnel and sank to his
knees

   pete his vitals torn with lead turned as
hardy fired life was now swiftly becom-
ing a vague receding thing to pete his
dimming faculties groped for the cause of
that rifle blast to his ear norn-yes it was
norn-was dying only hardy was left
and hardy blocked some insistent desire-
some all-important attainment a picture
of a dark-haired violet-eyed woman flashed
before the inner eyes of the rover the
ancient primitive desire blazed up-she
was within his grasp-one more heart-
wrenching effort and he would be alone-
with her swaying and grinning the death-
grin he fired from the hip at the gambler
for a breath hardy stared at him blankly
and then suddenly slumped

  all down-all down mumbled pete
his legs spraddling uncouthly

  slowly he turned to look down at norn

the rancher clawing falling strug-
gling on the slippery slope of agony
fought his way back to conscious-
ness he saw two spraddling legs slanted
his six-shooter upward and fired

  pete received the shot in the abdomen
he turned casually enough and with little
slow steps walked from the tunnel draw-
ing on some desert-fed source of vitality he
strolled to the center of the canon and
paused as if to meditate on the mysteries
of nature then suddenly he collapsed and
pitched forward on his face

  norn was now crawling from the mouth


adventure

of the tunnel his arm gave way under him
and he moaned faintly-

  dora dora

  his thought was for her safety not for
the aid she might give him

  for ages it seemed to him he fought
againrft shadow fiends intent on pulling
him down into oblivion inch by inch he
raised himself to his knees and swaying
turned slowly toward the tunnel for a
moment he stared at the litter of dead men
and then toppled forward

  silence an inquisitive lizard appeared
on a rock near the mouth of the tunnel and
cocked his head and blinked at the still
forms

  the girl numb with dread removed her
hands from her ears in the silence hope
cowered in the dust

  prayer had been her only resource in
those terrible crashing moments and now
she sought its sustaining strength but the
silence mocked her flouted her prayers and
sneered at her fainting soul-

  he is dead and all your prayers can
not bring him back from the land of
shadow

  in sudden wild desperation she crept to
the angle of the crosscut and peered down
the tunnel the rays from the setting sun
slanted into the tunnel bringing out the
dead faces with photographic clearness
those once virile creatures throbbing with
life were now as fallen trees in the wake of
a cyclone-still forms deathly silence
and norn the restless the daring the re-
sourceful had fallen only she remained
that she might mount her horse and ride
quietly home the man had died freely
he had offered up his body to ghastly
wounds that no desecrating hand might
touch her

  a faint moan quickened hope to panting
life perhaps-perhaps he had survived
she ventured past the angle but when she
came to the dead men her soul sickened at
the sordidness of death its flat and flaccid
sameness

  when she reached norns side he had
fought his way back to full consciousness
immediately his mind began grappling
with the situation the nerves telegraphed
his brain that he was badly hurt and he be-
gan to individualize his wounds with her
assistance he raised himself to a sitting
posture and attempted to take stock of his
injuries

  im all right he murmured and then a
billow of darkness overwhelmed him

  she eased him back and looked about her
frantically what could she do blood
from his wounded head was trickling into
his ear blood was welling from his shoulder
and chest and from lis side and from ms
thigh

  what shall i do-what shall i do she
wailed

  norns lips were moving she bent down
to catch the whispered words

 get water-canteen-go ranch-quick
-wagon-jack

  but youll die wmle im gone she
sobbed i can not leave you

  she saw his face set saw him summon
his reserve of strength saw ms lips form
the words-

  i will live

  she glanced up at his horse standing near
the bend in the canon and ran to secure
the canteen hanging from the saddle
horn

  the water revived norn wonderfully
he managed to murmur something con-
cerning bandages she drew off her under-
skirt tore it into strips and working fran-
tically managed to bind up his wounds
her surgical knowledge was limited and
the bandages were very crude and clumsy
but helped to stanch the flow of blood
when the last knot was tied she paused
for a breath and then bent down and kissed
him he felt the pressure of her lips and
his soul set itself for the grim unending
struggle he must not give up-he must
fight fight fight

  her horse not being gun-shy was crop-
ping bunch grass not far away she
mounted and rode at top speed toward the
ranch heedless of bush and boulder

  her whole mind was now concentrated
on speed and the deep-lunged desert-bred
horse responded nobly he carried her
across the open desert dodging the cholla
and barrel cactus and finally struck big
wash just below the stream-fed willows
up the far bank he plunged slipped strug-
gled somehow gained the top and sped up
the long slope to the ranch-house

  desert jack appeared in the bunk-house
door and she called to him wildly dickie
came running from the house squealing his
delight but the boy was of secondary im-
portance now

  norn is badly wounded she gasped to
the survivor



the foreman i left him near an old tun-
nel he was unable to move

  desert jack whirled and returned to the
bunk-house at top speed

  get your stuff he bawled at the doc-
tor who was bending over the mumbling
bundy norns badly shot up at the old
tunnel

  the foreman lumbered toward the stables
in an awkward gallop to develop a magical
speed in harness-handling he did not for-
get to snatch a lantern from a peg on the
stable wall for he knew that it would be
dark before they could reach the tunnel
nor did he overlook his big canvas-cov-
ered canteen

  dr cunningham was not a time-waster
and threw his satchel and his instrument
case into the spring wagon just as jack
hooked the last tug

  im going with you dora called

  tell her to stay with the boy doc
grumbled jack a womans no use no-
how

  stay here yelled the doctor as jack
sprang into the wagon and the team leaped
forward

  they dont want you said dickie with
a little touch of masculine swagger jack
says a girl cant do much anyhow

  he is probably right she sighed wear-
ily recalling her clumsy efforts to bind up
norns wounds

  bitter against the restrictions and the
limitations of her sex she slowly sought the
porch to watch and to wait

  the ride to the tunnel was one the doc-
tor never forgot desert jack stood up the
greater part of the way when the wagon
struck a boulder the foreman would rise in
the air apparently float for a moment and
then return with a leg-numbing clump to
the wagon they rode on three wheels on
two on one

  desert jack drew heavily on his vast
stock of profanity and weird objurgations

  limpin weepin bald-headed moses
move you mud-footed hay-burnin ham-
mer-heads hot ham you move i say by
the weedin feet of the twelve a-postles so
help me judas h priest did you ever see
such zim-zam sons of so-forth in all your
zink-zank zip-zapped days

  and at last they clattered into the canon
the doctor leaped from the wagon lantern
in hand and ran to norns side

  the dry little surgeons specialty was

gunshot wounds with deft sure move-
ments and the eager but clumsy assistance
of desert jack he scissored away the blood-
soaked clothing and doras crude bandages

rafss norn was vaguely conscious that
some one was working over him
that deft hands were applying
soothing bandages and compresses to his
wounds ages ago soft lips had pressed his
heartening his soul to rise dominant and
supreme above the cringing flesh grip-
ping the slippery edge of the-will-to-live as
a man suspended over a chasm grips a
rocky shelf he drew strength from the mem-
ory of that kiss and inch by inch worked
back to full consciousness his superb
vitality conserved by a life as clean as that
of some creature of the wild responded
quickly to the doctors ministrations

  couldnt kill you with a club he heard
the surgeon say

  then above the pulling drawing pain
of his wounds he felt the sharp stab of the
hypodermic

  again the doctors voice as from a great
distance

  miss dora got us here in jig time
youre all hunkydory now well have you
home in short order

  norn wanted to speak-to tell them to
care for any surviving members of the gang
but the words would not come the pain
became blurred shadows of drowsiness en-
compassed him nothing mattered now

  well load him into the wagon the
doctor planned briskly and then have a
look at the others i gave him a shot of
morphia that would put a horse to
sleep

  when they had placed norn in the wagon
desert jack led the way to the tunnel and
swung the lantern over the dead as the doc-
tor expertly examined the bodies

  guess this bunch dont need no nursin
was desert jacks grim conclusion pen-
sively he added as though ruminating over
some pleasant memory i was with dad
norn when he cleaned up the old gang
this reminds me of it things ought to be
quiet from now on

  as they left the tunnel the callous jack
viewing death as a mere incident called
back

  good-by boys ill see you later

  the bodies of pete and the first rider to
enter the canon caught jacks eye


adventure

  theres a couple more he lold the doc-
tor pete and yuma abe

  the doctor made a swift examination of
the two bodies and shook his head

 come on growled jack weve
wasted too much time on these critters al-
ready

  there might be some more jack the
doctor gently reproved we wouldnt
want to leave a wounded man to suffer

  all right grunted the foreman i
spose youre right you chive and ill go
ahead with the lantern and see if the boy
collected any more scalps

  jack holding the lantern above his head
zig-zagged to and fro in front of the team
as they emerged from the mouth of the
canon

  heres another one he called to the
doctor who was carefully guiding the team
around the boulders and the clumps of
greasewood its bill sycom

  the doctor leaped from the wagon and
proceeded to snatch bill back from the
shadow of death the rover had pleaded
in vain for help from the man with the bul-
let-creased brows that worthy intent
only on saving his own hide had left his
comrade to die later that incident re-
minded bill that there was no honor among
thieves and drove him into the peaceful
trail of honest citizenship

  in time the rover his agony eased by the
hypodermic was stretched out by norns
side

 no more stops now jack savagely
proclaimed i promised that boys daddy
to always look after him and by the livin
lights o my mothers eyes ill do it come
on now no more monkeydoodle busi-
ness

  the little doctor made no reply to the
grizzled foremans outburst but seized the
reins and clucked to the horses

  with desert jack walking ahead swing-
ing the lantern and marking a clear trail
then- progress was necessarily slow but they
finally reached the ranch without mishap

  dora and dickie were waiting on the
ranch-house porch the girl shivering with
dread the boy awed into silence by his
sisters despair

  hes alive shouted the doctor as he
pulled in the team near the porch and
hell live till hes a hundred get those
chinese busy with a couple of beds miss
dora

  dickie you hold the lantern bruskly
ordered desert jack and make yourself
useful

dora choking with joy ran to do
the doctors bidding she drove the
chinese servants to distraction with
wild orders and was finally forced to pre-
pare the beds herself they brought norn
in first dora flew to his side but the doc-
tors frown of disapproval made her draw
back abashed fearful that she had unwit-
tingly broken some all-important medical
law

  better leave him be snapped desert
jack with brutal frankness you cant
do him no good

  norn groping back to reality through the
opiate fog saw the girls face as though it
were floating on air

  take her to town he moaned faintly
firmly desert jack took the girls arm
and led her from the room she was too
disconcerted to resist

  youll find plenty of beds in the house
he said gruffly get some sleep

  the old foreman was unreasonable in his
love for king norn he considered the
girl and her brother responsible for it all
if it hadnt been fer that kid the gal
would have stayed where she belonged he
muttered and if it hadnt been fer her
theyd a-never cornered king dawg-gone
a hoodoo woman anyhow

  when bill had been placed on the bed in
the room adjoining norns and dickie had
been sent to liis sister the doctor turned to
jack

  youll have to go to town tonight for
help lie said removing his coat and vest
and rolling up his shirt sleeves i need a
lot of stuff too well give them another
going-over before you leave ill give you
a list of what i need i didnt anticipate
three men to look after

  wonder if i hadnt better take the gal
and the kid to town with me jack de-
bated

  certainly snapped the doctor
weve enough to look after without both-
ering with them

  jack stepped into the hall and called to
the girl bidding her prepare for a night
trip to town faintly came her assentiye
answer and he returned to the bedroom to
reassume his role of assistant surgeon
when the last fresh bandage was in place
the survivor

i

the doctor straightened up and rested his
hands on his aching back but he per-
mitted himself little relaxation

  rapidly he scrawled a list of his medical
needs and gave it to jack

  well have to bring bundy in the house
he told the foreman then ill have the
three of them under my eye and can man-
age till you return bring the beckner
boys back with you theyre friendly to
norn and are good reliable fellows now
for bundy	

  they found bundy sprawled out on the
bunk inert and stupid and carried him into
the house

  then desert jack hitched a fresh team
to the spring wagon and called to the girl
she came out with dickie clinging to her
arm and silent and forlorn obeyed jacks
gruff suggestion-

  youd better get in the back seat

  these men she thought seemed leagued
against her even norn the moment dan-
ger ceased to threaten her put her from
him she had thought to make some at-
tempt to repay him for what he had done
for her by tender nursing by reading to
him by many little soothing attentions but
it seemed she was not wanted doubtless
the gruff and grizzled being guiding the
horses through the gray gloom was right-
there was nothing that she could do she
was only a responsibility a burden and
she had been wickedly selfish to rid her-
self of worry she had foolishily ridden into
the desert against the repeated warnings of
her uncle to norn she had brought noth-
ing but agony litue wonder they desired
to be rid of her

  when they were on the main road and
within a few miles of town desert jack
squirmed a little as he recalled his gruff
treatment of the girl

  you see miss he half-apologized over
his shoulder a woman that haint used to
shootin cant do much i dont say its her
fault but shes better off all snug and quiet
in town not that we dont want you and
the boy around but because its better fer
you to be where folks-er-r-r-dont
have to worry about you understand
yes i understand she replied sorrow-
fully

  desert jack noting her sorrowful tone
mentally concluded that explanations or
near-apologies were wasted on a woman
he wagged his head hopelessly and whipped

up the team holding them to a rattling

pace

  through the cottonwoods they saw the
lighted windows of the hotel office and then
the white-sliirted figure of uncle charlie

  the old man emitted a joyous bellow of
welcome and waddled down and swept
dora and dickie to his breast desert
jack taking advantage of the excitement
drove on to rout out the druggist

chapter xiv

almost imperceptibly the mild
desert winter faded into the inef-
fable but ephemeral beauty of the
desert spring the snow which had given
to the crests of rain-maker and witch-talk
the semblance of shattered marble disap-
peared with magical suddenness and the
mountains became murmurous with many
waters through the soft mists that
wreathed the peaks rainbow after rainbow
smiled back at the paternal sun

  but to the lonely girl brooding on the
hotel porch the smiling rainbow signaled no
message of hope desert jack a bi-weekly
town visitor had kept uncle charlie in-
formed as to the various stages of norns
convalescence but had offered none of the
intimate details for which doras heart
craved she could not then bring herself
to question the grim forbidding old foreman
who while friendly enough with her uncle
seemed intent on avoiding all contact with
her

  even uncle charlie offered little or no
comfort following his bellow of joy at her
escape he had at every opportunity plied
her with questions concerning the fight and
its aftermath until in desperation she had
begged him to permit her to forget the hor-
ror of that struggle thereafter the old
man had refrained from any reference to
the battle contenting himself with giving
her brief excerpts from jacks reports con-
cerning norns condition

  the girl sad and introspective took to
watching the desert road some day per-
haps he would appear vital graceful and
debonair as of yore

  but whispered despair what of it
he does not love you no word of love had
he ever said to you you slipped your hand
into his and he made no response you
kissed him and he was heedless

common sense struggled for a hearing


adventure

crying faintly he knew you were greatly
excited when you slipped your hand into
his and when you kissed him he did not
respond because he was fighting his way up
from the valley of tlie shadow of death be
calm be practical-

  pride cold and insolent pushed common
sense aside and pointed toward the east
saying

  return to your own land and forget this
place of sun and sand this place where men
die with curses on their lips where hard-bit-
ten souls press on to some nameless goal
why should you at whose feet many men
have groveled pine and fret because one
man does not send you a message what
is he to you return to your security
seeking the safety of your old aloofness
become the amused woman again the spec-
tator the watcher have done with this
foolish yearning this agonizing you need
no mans love

  then the voice of pride faltered before
the golden tones of love

  pride is an empty-headed braggart
quoth love calmly listen and i will
give you the wisdom of ages my favor is
cheap at any cost how can the man help
loving you since you love him go to him
speak your innermost thoughts be unafraid
cast aside encumbering conventionalities
for i smile on those who dare has not the
man offered up his body to wounds for your
sake what more could you ask why
require silly little words why cling to the
customs of weak faltering fools who always
lose in the game of life and of love

  well she would write him a letter she
locked herself in her room and began a
struggle with the greeting

  dear mr norn seemed too formal for
the eye of a man who had dared death for
her sake she tore the paper into bits
my dear king norn impressed her as
being labored and it went the way of the
first at last she decided to give a little
touch of bravado to the greeting and ac-
cordingly she wrote

dear sir knight

  your major-domo the redoubtable jack has for
some strange reason refrained from giving us the
details of your recovery the days and weeks have
passed and we have heard no word from you beyond
the bare fact of your convalescence we-

  the uss and the wes annoyed her
why was she so chary of that brave little
pronoun i

  she tore the page into very small bits de-
ciding to write what was in her heart just
to see how it looked on paper of course
she would not mail the letter she started
bravely enough but the effort was no prize-
winning composition

my darling

  i love you-

 humor came to her rescue and she
laughed at the school-girlish lines what
would norn the virile the reader of good
books the worldly-wise the far-seeing-
what would he say if his eyes fell on those
mawkish lines where was her mental
poise her calm serene outlook couldnt
she think of anything beyond my dar-
ling-i love you apparently she could
not for she tore the paper into infinitesimal
bits and sighed like any love-lorn maid

      norn his wounds healed reposed
in an easy chair on the sunny porch
of the ranch-house and hearkened
to the pleas of one rat bundyand a cer-
tain humble and chastened bill it seemed
the twain were very grateful for certain
favors they had received at the hands of
norn and entertained fond hopes of having
the slate wiped clean they were not as
yet able to work but would be in time-
barring the anniversary of the snake-bite
which according to the doctor would bring
a mild recurrence of the symptoms-yes in
time they would be fully competent as cow-
hands post-hole diggers-in fact they would
welcome any sort of labor that would give
them an opportunity to prove that their
hearts were rightly placed

  very well norn agreed go to work
when youre able

  the rancher like all fighting men cher-
ished no hatred senseless hatred spout-
ing black abuse and petty revenge seem
to be peculiar to the softlings who when the
guns begin the death-talk hurry home and
crawl under a table

  bundy and bill returned to the bunk-
house counting themselves norn men
thereafter they would serve him faithfully
and loyally-and they did

  norn looked out over his pleasant do-
main but his thoughts were not for the
green alfalfa fields or the fat cattle he
was debating a question of far greater im-
portance than his possessions could he
now with safety tell her that he loved her
the survivor



he had been convinced from the first that
the man who threw himself at her feet could
not hope to meet with favor much less love
to prize love she must be made to seek it
to suffer in the quest he had suffered-the
puckered scars on his body attested that-
and she too must learn that love despite
the poets treads no primrose path

  of course she admired him and was
doubtless grateful but he did not want ad-
miration or gratitude nor caresses born of
excitement what he desired was love
unprompted by anything save his natural
ability to attract and to hold it the smit-
ten yokel might pursue the maid of his
choice but he king norn would trust to
attraction if attraction failed he would
not murmur

  still love required certain little ameni-
ties perhaps a letter-a cheerful humor-
ous letter-to her would bring a welcome
reply and he might have desert jack
take her some roses surely such a gift
would not place him in the category of the
frantic egotists she had so calmly rebuffed
unaware of desert jacks brusk treat-
ment of the girl he presumed she under-
stood that in sending her back to town his
only thought had been for her comfort and
safety he did not know that the old fore-
man had largely by avoiding the girl sought
to convince her that norn was glad to sever
an acquaintance that had brought nothing
but danger and suffering

  desert jack came up to the porch and
rather shamefacedly gave norn a huge
bouquet of wild asters he had gathered on
his return from town

  norns eyes brightened at the old fel-
lows thoughtfulness

  thought you might like em jack
said somewhat sheepishly

  you old scamp norn exclaimed affec-
tionately and laughed

  jack dodged playfully and seated himself
at the young mans feet he lighted his
pipe and puffed for a time

  yeh huh he recalled softly your ma
always liked flowers recollect when you
was a little feller me and you would get her
the first flowers huh one thing brings
another jes such a spring day as this
you was born king i brung your ma some
flowers like these and she jes insisted that
i hold you your pa was there so tickled he
was cryin  i give you back to your ma
and your pa follered me out and give me a

handful of gold says he jack i aint a
drinkin man and on you depends the honor
o celebratin the arrival of the new owner
of this ranch go to town and turn it up
on its left ear maybe you think i didnt
foller directions ask any o the old-timers
and theyll tell you that folks marked time
by that celebration

  a long pause and then casually

  talked with uncle charlie jes fore i
started home he said his niece was fig-
gerin on startin back east fer keeps next

week-

  norn straightened up and winced as
though against a stab of pain

  whats up king jack exclaimed
with quick solicitude that side bother
you

  nothing-just a twinge go on you
said-she had decided to leave-next week
uh hull jack went on in gossipy fash-
ion boys well and strong now and
uncle charlie says shes sick of this coun-
try i told him that wimmin as a genral
rule were more responsibility than theyre
worth she was in the office and heard me
she come out and says she mr jack im
sorry if ive been a burden to any one
you can convey my regrets to mr norn
and bid him farewell for me thems her
very words and im bound to admit the
way she said em made me duck and dodge
uncle charlie seemed all rattled and shuck
up he tells me on the side every time he
opens his mouth he puts his foot in it
guess i got the same habit well anyway
shes goin and i reckon the country will

take a rest-

  jack sharply imperative

the old man dodged norn gave him a
long somber look then the rancher rising
abruptly dropped the flowers in his chair
and paced the length of the porch and back
hows my gait

  steady enough admitted the puzzled
foreman

  how do i look 

  not so bad little pale around the
gills though sunburns off you and id
say youre short fifteen pounds

  think id stand a ride to town-and
look like anything when i got there
why yes jack debated if you
take it easy and dont over-do

  then get spot and my best saddle
this with suppressed excitement that added
to the foremans puzzlement and


adventure

jack- over his shoulder as he hurried
into the house-dont talk so much

  jack gaped weakly and wagged his head
sharp words from a youngster he had
raised remotely his mind dulled with
long years of labor connectcd the girl with
norns unusual outburst

  dawg-gone a hoodoo woman he grum-
bled on his way to the stable cant she
see he wants to get shut of her

  carefully he curried and saddled the
spotted horse the animal had had a long
rest and as jack led him up to the porch
he gave vent to his spirits by little pranc-
ings and playful nips at the foremans arm
to norn he nickered a soft welcome

  ho-ho old boy laughed the rancher
im glad to see you

  he pressed his cheek against the velvety
muzzle he mounted and settled himself
in the saddle what a joy it was to feel a
horse between his knees again to look up
at the sky instead of a ceiling to recover
health and strength wonderful world

  the sunshine of gladness flooded his soul
he leaned from the saddle and gripped the
old mans shoulder

  i told john to put the flowers you
brought in water and jack forget what
i said-about you talking too much
good-by

  desert jack looked after the man who
held all the affection of his cynical old
heart

  same as he was when a boy he softly
soliloquized sorry the moment he hurt
your feelins-ready to say he was wrong
norn cantered down the hemper road
conscious that all his line of calm reasoning
had crumpled before the sweeping assault
of one fact-she was going away there
was now no time for further experiments
love he now humbly admitted could not
be reduced to a scientific basis nothing
possessed sufficient strength to either coax
or coerce love even the circle of danger
with which he had surrounded her was a web
of gauze to stay the coming or the going of
love

  what man worthy of love would pause
at any circle of danger though it were woven
of the fires of hell bah he had done too
much thinking love was heedless of
thoughts or words or even deeds delight-
ing in upsetting all the calculations of man
in nullifying his most carefully-planned
actions in snapping rosy fingers under the

nose of the philosopher in refuting all that
has ever been said or written since man rose
from the primeval slime

  despite his claims of dominance his per-
fervid announcements of superiority his
eager acceptance of the empty title of pur-
suer man when it came to love was com-
pared to woman a conceited numbskull a
passer of bouquets to self a half-wit fumb-
ling with the dynamite of destiny woman
loves trusted agent enjoyed plenipoten-
tiary powers rightly denied blundering man
she was versed in loves secret diplomacy
and she knew long long before the self-
imagined dominant one awoke from his
trance of egotism the winning moves in the
ancient game

  about all a man could do was to tell her
that he loved her-a fact no doubt of
which she was well aware from the moment
of their first meeting he king norn
ranked not one notch above one of his cow-
boys riding to learn his fate from the lips of
some giggling girl

  to plan to think to do anything save to
tell her that he loved her was futile if she
smiled heaven would be his if she was un-
responsive he could only return to the old
desert and suffer-and somehow survive

  suddenly weariness overwhelmed him and
he felt sick and faint he was not as strong
as he had supposed she must not see him
worn and faint he longed to see her but
pride insisted on an appearance of strength
he would rest a little and then as of yore
dash into town dismounting he noted
that the movement jarred him as he
stretched out by the roadside he drew a
deep breath of the perfumed air and then
relaxed nature working unceasingly to
restore energy whispered to him-

  sleep sleep sleep

  just a few moments of blessed repose and
he would press on to learn his fate but
the kindly mothering desert had a different
plan soothed by the murmurous voices of
spring warmed by the friendly sun he fell
asleep

       dora after her epistolary failures
had brooded for a few days and
then had resolved to make what she
considered a final desperate move she
would at the first opportunity get word to
norn that she had decided to return to her
eastern home if the man cared he would
bestir himself if he was indifferent she
the survivor



could find some surcease from pain in the
thronging city

  calmly she informed uncle charlie of her
decision he plumped down in his chair
nearly wrecking it

  my gawd dora you dont mean it he
wheezed whatll i do ill be so lone-
some ill want to die

  a grampus sigh and then meekly

  well i spose this town holds nothin for

you i had hoped though that youd-

  oh im not leaving today she inter-
rupted with a little teasing laugh some-
time next week-maybe

  maybe echoed uncle charlie clutch-
ing at straws

  she nodded brightly and left him to his
thoughts

  the next day fortune favored her plan
and desert jack as related became an un-
witting cupid she watched the foreman
drive down the desert road norn now
doubtless able to ride would have time
after desert jack arrived at the ranch to
ride to town before dark surely-if he
cared-he would come it was just a
chance and she shivered with nervous
dread

  reading was a bore there was no solace
in music even dickie oppressed her if
norn started hemperward-and the
thought made her heart leap-she might
ride out and meet him-accidently

  danger she snapped her fingers and
tossed her head proudly she had met dan-
ger face to face and had not whimpered
then though she did not name it she now
knew that norns spirit walked before her
as a lictor walks before royalty no more
she had not failed to note was she greeted
with bland insinuating smiles the men of
the desert now ventured naught but brief
respectful salutations seemingly intent on
passing her as quickly as possible

  hurriedly she donned her riding-habit
and was soon galloping down the desert road
when she came to the ranch road she
halted to debate what seemed to her a most
momentous question should she ride on

boldly and meet him or should she turn
about and permit him to overtake her
deliberately she refused to contemplate the
probability of disappointment

  she became conscious of faint plaintive
cries drifting down from the void above her
she looked up and smiled at a long v of wild
geese moving steadily northward no hu-
man bickering for them no false pride no
evasiveness their sure swift flight was
their answer to the ancient call they
swerved slightly and she lost them in the
glow of the sinking sun

  suddenly she was thrilled with wild re-
bellion against every tiling that kept her
from the man she loved what folly it was
to quibble with fate to exact conditions to
listen to the solemn pratings of pride she
would go to him-now even to the ranch

  she turned her horse into the ranch road
laughing excitedly

  when she saw the spotted horse and the
prostrate figure in the sand her heart almost
stopped beating she could not imagine
norn inactive or resting he was hurt

  but he had seen her coming after all-
and he smiled faintly-his theory of attrac-
tion held real values he blessed the weak-
ness that had prompted the siesta in the sun
and pretended to be asleep

  she fell on her knees at his side sobbing-

  youre hurt oh i know you must be
hurt

  there was no mistaking the poignant love-
note-the wicked dissembler-he rose as
though greatly startled then he laughed
softly

  despite her protest against his over-exer-
tion he assisted her to rise and then
scarcely knowing how it happened she was
in his arms and they were murmuring the
age-old nonsense of lovers

  came the purple evening with a sickle
moon attended by a single star hanging
low over witch-talks crest

  the desert is a paradise now sighed the
girl

  his reply was all that she could desire-

  with you-yes

affirmative reply iam yours truly

  miss somers waited gideon was slumped
in hip chair the bare suggestion of a smile
on his face he sat so a moment hands
loosely clasped across his rotund stomach
his lips moved in soundless syllables he
rose languidly

  thatll do for now he said as if he
thought of other things

  he gazed into the street below he
jingled his keys he turned and looked
at the picture again hulbert the fore-
man came in letting the din of machinery
through the door limes sighed impa-
tiently and walked heavily toward him

  and washington c kirk who should
have had his mind on the work before him

followed the corpulent walk until his em-
ployer had passed down between the rows
of bumping presses his blue eyes shifted
then to the small competent head of vera
somers and rested there for so tcnacious an
interval that the young lady looked up
from her note-book left off pattering the
keys of her typewriter and with her smil-
ing brown ones met them she flushed
her eyes flamed her trim shoulders trem-
bled and she turned back to her work
leaving toward him one smooth pink cheek
tempting to a degree

  just that but when kirk forced his gaze
back at the task before him he found that
it was a trifle giddy that the symbols on
bills and invoices were less prosaic and
could he have known the look that hinted
at loneliness which liad been in them for
four long months had almost disappeared

  for those four long months young kirk
had functioned as stock and shipping clerk
in the detroit factory of the g limes can-
screw works aqd during that span though
he rubbed elbows with those about him
he had lived in complete isolation

  limes the stodgy bachelor could scarcely
be expected to grow companionable with
the lowliest of his office staff puny
boggs who kept the books was not the type
to grow chummy with a youth hulberts
digestive disorders made it difficult for him
to handle the factory force let alone make
friends and miss somers the efficient
the intent had so impressed him with the
impersonal quality of her manner that from
the first he had told himself that hope of
familiar contact there was impossible

  but now when their smiling glances met
and struck response he knew that he had
been mistaken knew that behind the girls
office demeanor lurked characteristics that
were far from repelling and the realization
warmed him-even more than did the shaft
of sunlight now streaming full across his
desk

  his attention like his eyes persisted
in straying across the fitter before him
across the floor to vera somers desk where
they lingered speculating

hwhen the noon gong sounded
kirk whisked through the office
door and trotted the four blocks
to the one dingy restaurant the vicinity
afforded then back again after gastro-
nomic accomplishments of rather amazing


adventure

rapidity he knew that the girl brought
her lunch with her

  when he reentered the office that lunch
scarcely tasted yet was arrayed on a nap-
kin spread over veras desk she looked
up at the unusual intrusion a sandwich
half-way to her mouth-a mouth as red as
the glass of jelly staining the linen she
smiled and tossed her head a gesture which
was not at all like an intent executive so
girlish so gay

  he approached slowly not just certain of
himself and stood before her stiffly

  the sunshine he began sort of fogged
up our esteemed employers mind

  she laughed and bent forward quickly
poor old fellow she cried and wash
kirk thrilled at the lilt in her unbusiness-
like voice he gets that way every spring
when the first warm days come and he com-
mences to dream of fishing

  cant blame him said the boy still
uneasy not knowing just what to say to
this girl the boardmans a great stream
especially for browns

  oh are you a fisherman too

  she looked up quite amazed wash
kirk flushed her quick interest was as
pleasing as it was evident

  not his kind my homes in the trout
country and fishing is just like sleeping
well or eating with a good appetite mat-
ter of course we expect it

  you came from the country she
breathed incredulously isnt that fine
her brown eyes were wide and realizing
kirk felt his assurance mounting

  which coming from the country or
coming from the country

  oh just knowing it being a part of it
my how we city folks envy you

  his blue eyes searched her face at that
prying to find insincerity she sat relaxed
in her chair mouth drooping a trifle as
though she were tired she seemed a little
girl there wholly unlike the self-reliant per-
son who had awed him

  i guess you mean it he said delighted
leaning a hip against her desk ive heard
people say it who didnt mean it

  of course i mean it she replied se-
riously ive never seen the country except
at a resort at too many dollars a week
ive never known country people or any-
thing but city ways until i came here

  poor mr limes he isnt very graphic
and he never talks to me except on business

but sometimes i think i get more out of
the letters he dictates to his fishing pals
than i do out of anything else-about
the country hes awfully prosy but i
know how deeply he feels about rivers and
woods and sometimes when hes been send-
ing off letters about them or his vacation
plans or the fish he has caught i cant get
down to work for hours

  wash kirks manner changed the re-
straint left him he moved around the
desk seated himself on its edge heedless of
the way his coat threatened disaster to the
unconsumed meal and said

  thats funny here ive been on the
job four months with never a soul to talk
to about the open believing that you all
that you especially didnt have time to
think of anything but the city

  ive lost weight for loneliness you
see its horribly necessary that i stay here
a while a long while and i was just about
getting down to the ragged edge what
with being lonesome and not knowing any-
body whod agree with me about a city and
not being able to take my job or any of your
jobs as seriously as you people seem to take
them-i-gee whiz miss somers why
didnt you say something

  say something how was i to know
that anybody in this rackety place knew
about the tilings ive longed for

  and so they went on each revealing to
the other the one the eagerness to learn
the other the longing to re-live by telling
eyes warming intimately kirk hitching
along the desk closer to her as each freshly
discovered common interest delighted him

  you said she ventured in a pause
that it was necessary-horribly necessary
-for you to stay here

  yes well it is shaking his head
slowly you see my dads a queer old
bird hes the gaylord potato-planter
company which youve never heard of
if i stay here long enough itll be me

  my governor started that factory when
i was so big now its going to be pretty
much mine-maybe last year dad got
the idea that we had no efficiency no
modern methods all tliat sort of thing
so he sends washington g out into the
world to learn the manufacturing game

   go out says he stay a year come
back with a letter of recommendation that
youve won by hard work and enterprise
and the managements yours
a fish story about love



  fine understand but my dad hes
rock-ribbed if i should fall down-

  he whistled two little descending notes
of apprehension

  id have to take my chance in some
place like the limes can-screw works for
good-and then whered i be

  i dont amount to much he went on
after the silent interval which followed his
shoulder-shrug if i did id take this
years stunt seriously ive learned a lot
but somehow i like our little factory better
only ten men understand we call em all
by their first names and they do us my
mother is neighborly with their wives
when one of em wants a days fishing he
takes it and if were behind we all work
evenings we havent had a man leave
since i can remember

  its the usual tiling for country boys to
come to the city ive never wanted to
since ive been here ive wanted to get
back home-awfully why the folks here
re all pitiable to me poor old limes
with his eight per cent of the year fishing
and boggs think of a man spending his
life taking ledgers so seriously im not
under-estimating his importance but hed
be a lot better bookkeeper even if he took
limes advice and played a little

  hulbert-ill bet he hasnt laughed
since he saw his first automobile he thinks
the sun rises and sets among those machines
he doesnt even know parks let alone that
rivers run and winds blow

  and ive got to try to be like those men
for a year-gee whiz

  he told her of his home of the great cut-
over lands the plains of northern michigan
of fish he had caught grouse he had killed
the furs he had trapped for his mother he
etched cedar swamps under winter moons
and duck-shooting on houghton lake
he told of running white water in a canoe
of hiking through autumn woods he
talked of wild flowers and birds

  he enthused over his dogs the setter
the hounds over skating and skiing de-
scribed his runs on snow-shoes he dis-
cussed the fine craft of camping and went
into ecstasies over sunsets and storms she
listened eagerly to his stories of the lumber
camps of weather indications and without
consciousness whatever she leaned toward
him pointed chin in her hand eyes reflect-
ing her hunger for more

  but she argued finally all you have

to do is make good on this job and you can
go back to it think of us whove never
had a chance to know what you know who
dislike this racket and rush just as much
as you do

  yes make good on this job he inter-
rupted scowling absently i havent a
chance of going back unless i make good
my governors that sort so i will-ive
got to now then focusing his eyes on
her face-i think youre going to like it
very much up there

  oh she said with a catch of her
breath and started back

  nor did she allow him to kiss her-not
for three full weeks

      after they had made their pact
they decided quite originally they
foolishly thought to keep it wholly
to themselves for an indefinite time

  having it a secret will make it all the
better wont it he asked as several
million lovers annually ask

  walks in the parks followed and long
rainy evenings together reading aloud from
books and from one anothers faces and
no one else knew-not a soul

  one may morning after he called vera
for the first dictations gideon limes un-
wrapped a bundle from the printers it
contained big white boards with black
characters on them-

smoking positively prohibited

and while he sat there he wielded a heavy-
leaded pencil on one of the placards then
quite deliberately seriousness reflected in his
little gray eyes he held it up

  oh kirk said he tack this up where
itll do the most good

  in a flaming flush the boy read-

love affairs positively
prohibited

  limes tossed it rather indifferently to
kirks desk and began the days work

   at noon the lad said to his sweetheart
the old chump howd he find out
i suppose its his idea of a joke

  vera eyed him a long moment

  i wish i could think that dear you
see i know him so well and im sure he
didnt do it to be funny he meant it
the fact is hes come to depend on me for
so many things that he doesnt like to
bother with that hed have to do if i didnt
o

adventure

  theres no sentiment in his life hes
never been in love the only thing he
considers now is that hes in danger of
losing me hed be awfully mad if he
thought you intended taking me away
from here

  if it werent for circumstances we
wouldnt care a rap but you know dear
that if we fail to get our letter of recom-
mendation out of this office it means six
months lost-and six months is a terribly
long time

  kirk nodded grave assent

  a week passed the two particularly care-
ful to display no indications of affection and
limes looking over his fat shoulder grunted
a summons for wash

  ever fish much kirk he asked and
before an answer could be given-as tf
the reply were of no consequence whatever
-went on its my religion-fishing my
picture there nodding spend a month
near traverse city every summer

  most time to go now every time i
get ready to go i think about something
that happened a few years back

  had a rod wonderful rod moller
dry-fly special built for me four ounce
eight feet balanced like a watch great
for night fishing when you cant see your
fly could always tell by the feel just what
i was doing

  got so i depended on that rod it did
my fishing for me didnt realize for a
long time what its value was

  fella come up to our camp who didnt
know the game we fishermen dont take
to greenhorns much but he was a nice fella
and wanted to learn i lent him my rod

  he got a rise whipped back like a
greenhorn will crazy to get his fly on the
water in a rush again hooked the brush
behind him didnt think slashed down like
he was splittin wood put a set in that
rod of mine-strained it understand

  he looked at the photograph and blinked
then picked up a sheaf of papers

  ruined you know wriggling forward
in his chair ruined-ab-so-lutely 

  thats all kirk

  wash moved toward his desk puzzled

  oh kirk he faced about since
then ive never let my likin for a fella
interfere with my own interests keep my
tackle to myself now if a fella come
along and insisted on using anything i
depended on-id run him out of camp

  with a pencil he commenced checking
footings on the papers he held

  as they walked that night in palmer
park wash kirk related the incident and
after a silent hand-gripping moment vera
sighed

  itll go hard with us im afraid no
use shutting our eyes to it hes so set
in his ways that nothing can change him
he cant make himself think of giving up
an idea why the way he quarrels with
his best friends in letters is frightful

  if they catch more or bigger fish than
he does he raves if they disagree with
him about tackle he never forgets he
hasnt any use for anybodys opinions or
wants-except the men who win big-fish
prizes in the magazines he reads he almost
worships them but other folks-hes sure
to have his way at any price

  you see hes bound im not going to
leave him he thinks youre to blame-

and hell-hell-

  there dont fret he said scowling up
into the trees if he fires me i can start
again itll only be six months lost

  but im jealous of thosesix months i
want you all and i know you cant love
me your fullest until you take me away
so day by day they strove to be oblivious
of one another and not heed the cloud that
impended-a bald-headed gray-eyed cloud
which rumbled enigmatic thunder threats-
and the time grew shorter before their
months reprieve when limes would be
away

  if we can tide things over until then
wash said frowning at the water from
their deck seats on a belle isle ferryboat
we have more of a chance hes getting
restless the other day i saw him looking
into a fly-book on the sly and yesterday he
was discussing reels over the telephone
hell be shy on patience and the least little
things likely to spill our beans

  and if he does come back rested and
happy he may overlook what we fail to
cover up vera said slowly with the
procrastinating optimism of youth

junes first fortnight dragged along
dragged for the boy and girl be-
cause dread was on them with all
their happiness and dragged for gideon
because the call of the stream had fevered
his veins the last days were a furious
harvest of detail and never before had
a fish story about love



wash kirk realized how fully limes de-
pended on vera

  she was his memory his sense of cau-
tion continually beside him alert antici-
pating wants unobtrusively advising him
taking the initiative at other times the
two worked evenings and for a week the
lovers had little privacy that told on the
girl even more than the long hours and
kirk saw with great pride that she missed
him frightfully

  no wonder hes sore at me the boy
thought

  the last mad day suit case waders
rods hip boots tackle boxes creel land-
ing net piled about him like offerings to
some fat god gideon limes sat in his shirt-
sleeves glaring at the final barriers which
kept him from freedom vera vibrated
between him and her desk rattling off let-
ters with amazing speed eyes bright color
high nerves strained but now and then
she looked at wash kirk and the light in
her eyes softened her mouth lost its tensity
and she smiled most adorably

  noon-two oclock-an hour until train
time pen in hand gideon limes hur-
riedly read the final letters one by one
he scrawled his signature and put them
aside he gathered the last reading as
was his habit with moving lips

          acme brass foundry
          toledo ohio

                     washington dearest

  he put down his pen he turned pon-
derously to look at vera he kept on
moving until his gaze rested on washing-
ton g kirk he eyed the youth a moment
then gave that summoning grunt

  when the apprehensive youth approached
limes buttoning his collar said

  of course were sorry you have to leave
us young man i hope you can see your
way clear to staying on the customary two
weeks

  kirks mouth opened and closed twice
before words came

  but i dont want to quit mr limes
i want to stay-i-why ive been trying
my best there hasnt been a word said to
me i-

  remember my spoiled rod the fella
who used it did the best he could too

  oh boggs lifting his voice and turn-
ing away as with fat chin lifted and fat
e

fingers fumbling he contrived a knot in
his black tie

  when he had gone boggs teetering after
for a last word vera gave way and look-
ing into the sweltering street cried openly

  never mind sweetheart kirk whis-
pered putting his arms about her shoul-
ders ill hook on somewhere else

  if he were only like other men the
girl sobbed we might appeal to some
other side of him but he knows only
th-this and fish-fishing theres no way

to approach-ch him h-he-

  she looked up suddenly tear-filled eyes
peculiarly jilert

the valley of the boardman was
gathering its purple mists of even-
ing the sun had gone the cerise
bloom of the sky faded to a pink flush the
river gurgled contentedly in the quiet its
surface rosied in places polished ebony in
others and here and there flecked by silver
as a snag or ripple broke the even flow
a stranger in black relief was casting
across the stream and above the water hung
a myriad of insects wide gauzy-winged
creatures the caddis-fly born at dusk to
live its span of minutes and pass on

  gideon limes sat alone on the screened
porch of the uneedsumfish inn staring with
unseeing eyes out across that panorama
it was the hour above alt others to fish
by thousands the expiring flies settled to
the water and by scores the fish were feed-
ing no need for description you fish-
ermen need no words to breed the thrill at
memory of plopping splashing trout as
they break evening water to feed and you
the uninitiated explanation to you would
be meaningless

  gideon limes was aware of what tran-
spired and yet no enthusiasm stirred in
him last night-another such an evening
-the lunker had struck his fly hung a
frantic moment and tom loose but even
the prospect of having the great fish on
again did not stir him life on the river
had lost its keen taste

  he could trace the reason back to the
hour of his departure leaving the factory
under that stifling sense of being tied for
years he had worked with a perfect office
staff now it was ruined by a love affair
with a red-headed whipper-snapper that
had made him irritable his irritation he
found made inroads on his luck


adventure

  he did not have the necessary patience
to fish effectively his companion rivals
picked on him too and he writhed under
their jibes choosing now to sulk rather
than dominate by sheer bulk confound
love anyhow he thought as his mind went
back again to the office he stirred in his
chair swinging the landing net he held to
relieve the rancor in his heart

  footsteps coming toward him grasses
swishing against boots he looked up and
could barely distinguish the figure of a
fellow camper

  gid oh gid the man called and
he answered hustle somebodys got
your big fish on just below the bridge

  gideons discontent dissolved suddenly
he slammed the screen door behind him
and waddled across the open

  who is it he calledbut the other the
better runner did not hear

  the pink had gone from the west just
a silvered sky remained enabling the iden-
tification of figures not of faces and as
gideon neared the stream he saw his four
companions moving along on his side oilier
men across the water

  and in the river a man thigh deep ran
down the languid current in great floun-
dering strides heaping the black water into
phosphorescent mounds as he went his
right hand held the straining rod and his
left paid out line swiftly as he followed the
rush of the fish he had hooked as gideon
came close and started following the course
of the river the man slowed his pace grad-
ually dropping to a walk giving out line
more eagerly reducing his walk to a reluc-
tant edging along while the bamboo bent
and bowed mightily

  then the tip of the rod vibrated and
writhed and a hundred feet below them
the water was ripped in a gleaming gash
as the frantic fish charged across toward
the other bank gideon limes standing
still held his breath as in sympathetic
reaction he clamped his right hand and felt
the strain come to bear on the tackle then
gasped aloud as the fish broke water

  he burst through with a vigor which
told of superb strength of splendid fury
for an instant he was in silhouette against
the dead white sky full three feet in the
air a wonderful water-creature taking to
an alien element in his battle for liberty
then losing rigidity the fish crashed back
body slapping the surface with its full

length sending out a shower as of new
silver coins to spatter for yards about

  and as he went under the man took in
a length of line quickly deftly careful not
to bring up slack too suddenly the tip
of the rod bent and quivered again dip-
ping low before the strain stiffly pointing
out the direction of its quarry while the
man braced backward against the ripples
breathing in a low grunt to attest to the
tug yonder

  again the fish leaped again he crashcd
down limply as if to fall on the strand
which snared him and break with his
weight that which he could not part with
his pull again and again until he had
displayed himself a black blotch against
the western sky six times

  then change the water quieted the
rod stood straight out springing lightly
not an oimce of weight there

  gone by heck some one cried

  gone like- snorted gideon limes

look

  a ribbon of riffle showed moving swiftly
up-stream the man in the water watched
it go watched it pass him not a dozen feet
away and all the time his reel ate slack
yard upon yard he turned following
with his eyes the trail of the moving line
until he faced up-stream then com-
menced to walk to run leaning low against
the flow of water and when the trout did
strike resistance again his enemy was mov-
ing with him putting the strain on leader
line and rod gradually carefully skilfully
so that when the splints were again doubled
and a-tremble the tension had come on
them easily not of a sudden

  look out for those snags gideon cried
voice betraying his excitement snags
and jams all along the other side

  thanks

  in an ordinary tone quite coolly the
response came from the other as he slowed
to a walk and worked in close against the
bank to put himself across the stream from
the trout giving the necessary trifle of
slack and watching the moving flap of
water laid back by the ripping line as his
fish drove to and fro laboring toward the
tangle of logs

  man to fish fish against man fighting
that superb up-stream fight that the ger-
man brown makes giving taking each
wise in the ways of battle the fish close
to bottom in his three feet of water putting
a fish story about love



every ounce into the struggle toward safety
so near the man deft collected dis-
playing that fine repression of effort which
marks the master angler countering move
with move stealing a yard here yielding
a foot there scheming for a position that
would give him a cross-pull on the trouts
head to hold it away from its objective

  youll lose him drag him out a man
across the stream advised

  itll be my loss then evidently nettled
by suggestion from the clearly inexpert

  yet the man gave inch by inch moving
forward a step halting bracing until it
seemed as though something must snap
then surrendering another foot but each
time he made that stand it was for a longer
duration the back fin of the brown
showed above the water within a yard of
the jam that offered shelter where he could
tangle and break the leader another foot
the man granted another hands breadth

  minute after minute they fought in
silence now for those who watched spoke
but rarely and then in hushed voices oc-
casionally the man in the stream grunted
or muttered an indistinguishable word
the trout worked back and forth feverishly
and the man gave-when he did not want
to give-letting the creature wriggle closer
into the scant margin which was between
him and his haven the zig-zags became
shorter more frantic he burrowed for
deeper water and the rod segment became
more acute

  then with a foot perhaps to spare the
man braced himself on spread legs leaned
backward and swung the tip of his rod
straight upward it was the crisis and
gideon limes felt his heart slow with ap-
prehension would the tackle stop the
fish or would it set him free

  the man in the river strained with stilled
breathing pound by pound he applied the
upward pull considerate of his tackle yet
risking all against the resistance of the
trout risking it cautiously and wisely
deeper grew the dip of the tip the slender
whip of bamboo bent clear to the grip and
still the brown withstood the drag wrig-
gling sharply

came the telling moment the
rod vibrated the line was taut and
still as though fast finally to the
snag itself so for the space of a deliberate
breath and with a hissing gasp of relief

of triumph the man was moving with the
river for that last ounce had drawn the
fish to the surface turned him over with a
flop and a cuff of the broad tail and headed
him with the flow away from the dangerous
jams

  goo boy cried gideon limes brand-
ishing the landing net and jogging along
through the grass to keep abreast

  for an interval the man sloshed through
the water letting the fish go but holding
him just within control they rounded an
easy bend moving with the current

  hows the water below the man asked
not turning his head

  jam clear across thirty rods down-
shallow water-banks clear-look out for
hole to left-if he gets to that jam-water
awful deep-

  information rained on him and gideon
limes panting in his effort to make through
the brush that now covered the banks
dropped into the water splashing along a
dozen yards behind the fisherman forget-
ting the absence of his waders

  a whippoorwill sounded its lonely note
a nighthawk squnked as it swooped close
over their heads the gloom deepened
but the afterglow caught again and flung
upward by the water let them see

  below was down-timber clear across the
stream they could hear the laugh of the
water as it sported over that obstacle
and the man with the fish began to slow
once more by fine degrees looking from
side to side working out into mid-stream
where the water reached his hips

  he was deliberate in action now almost
hesitant always underplaying and before
the others realized he had checked the
flight of his trout was standing still stooped
forward from the waist resisting sturdily

  again the fish leaped not so high not
with so much verve and display of strength
and again the man stole slack as he crashed
back on the water he sulked working
sluggishly over to the right bank he
leaped again and a third time sullen
thereafter keeping close to the bank

  then he turned and veered for the other
side back and across again and again
twisting the rod until he threatened to
wrench it to slivers and to meet that
stress the man was again forced to move
on down each step bringing the water
higher about him to his waist-his
stomach-half-way to his armpits


adventure

  he stopped still and with indications
of finality below was deep water once
there no tackle could hold that fish so
again the man forced a crisis lay back
against the current lifted the tip of his
rod and applied that upward pull

  the trout showed a flash of his back and
his tail flung into the air to smack the
water once more the dark hump and
again the arc described by the tail time
after time end over end rolling like a hoop
head chasing tail tail flaying out in frantic
effort the fish in a hysteria of rage strove
to break down the mans strength

  it did not avail in a flash he was speed-
ing up-stream he reached the end of the
line hesitated an instant and swept back
with the current then across then up
once more that time near the other bank
while the man always facing his fish took
in a foot at a time satisfied to win slowly
never yielding now

  on the bank the watchers stood silent
jn the stream-gideon limes shivered un-
consciously from the night damp and let
mosquitoes feed on his fat neck without
protest his mouth was dry eyes aching
from the strain of following the fight

  you got him now he rumbled and
when the other did not answer repeated
you got him now here let me help
waving the landing-net

  stay out watch

  the other snapped out the words for the
fish had turned and back-fin showing
charged up the river he went beyond
his captor he passed gideon he swung
toward mid-current and limes floundered
stepping high as he felt the fine tighten
about his legs somehow he got free with-
out disaster panting audibly

  now if you can keep out of the way
the other said with stinging dispassionate-
ness ill try to land this fish

  gideon muttered something he did not
know what his thrill covered wholly his
humiliation

  another quarter hour passed the moon
was shining silvering the stream letting
them follow every tired move of the drown-
ing trout up and down in short spas-
modic flights devoid of sweep or power
he went now and then his yellow belly
flashed as he turned on his side at no
interval was he wholly submerged five
-ten minutes the man toyed with him so
adding caution to caution then reeling

in slowly confidently leading the fish
gently about at his leaders length he
dipped his net and waded toward shore
a dripping glistening weight in the mesh

  holy smoke what ai fish some one
cried come on to the shack lets look
at him in tiie light

  fighting it over again talking all at once
they trailed across the misty flat toward
the uneedsumfish inn and in their wake
gideon moved heavily reaction had set
in for years he had dreamed of taking
that fish and now he realized that he never
could have taken him it wasnt in his
mind or body to fish as this man had fished
he was not born to it he remembered
the sharp rebuke and suddenly he felt
quite inferior-inferior and depressed

  they were clustered about the lighted
lamp when he entered in its glow lay
the great trout wide-eyed gasping bright
yellow was his belly color deepening as
it swept up his goodly girth to his rich
brown back the darker spots on him
were big clearly cut and the red dots stood
out vividly from the more somber shadings
-a superb specimen crowding thirty
inches six firm pounds gideons little gray
eyes sparkled again as he gazed upon the
trout then he lifted that gaze to the
white elated face of the stranger

  his jaw dropped incredulously he held
out a hand

  kirk he cried kirk my boy when

the devil-how in-why-

 he pumped washingtons hand and
looked about into the faces of the other
admirers with rising triumph

  youre friends one of his companions
asked perhaps enviously

  friends-drawing himself up-why
hes my right-hand man in the office by
the lord harry it took somebody from
that office to show you fellas up to let you
know what real fishing is

  his vacation you see- looking at the
youth a peculiar flush on his own face-
hell stay until my times up well go
back to work together

  he slapjied kirk on the shoulders

  by the lord harry boy youve caught
my fish-and- meeting the blue eyes-
youve hooked something else of mine
but there re as good fish in the boardman
aseverve been caught and thats true of
everything-men and women-stenogra-
phers and all those things
the pearl of torres

                          hy louis esson

when ted jarrett of new york
city drifted into the pictur-
esque pearling village by torres
straits the monotony of life had
just been relieved by a little shooting af-
fair the chief actor was leon rod a
jewel-buyer who traveled between thurs-
day island and the scattered villages on the
coast engaging divers arranging outfits and
occasionally buying pearls he had engaged
two malays muda and tuah as divers for
one of the big fleet owners but when they
had signed the contract and each received
ten pounds in advance they formed the
plan to slip away to the aroe islands in
dutch waters that had not been fished so
much as torres straits

  this simple scheme miscarried because
one night the malays got so gloriously
drunk and talkative that they let out their
secret big bailey the police constable
arrested the culprits and locked them up
in the ramshackle jail the malays
promptly escaped and vtent to interview
rod who was smoking a cigar on the hotel
veranda in the midst of their vociferous
explanations rod suddenly drew a revolver
and fired tuah fell shot through the
heart and muda with a scream dashed
down the street and disappeared when a
crowd gathered round the dead body of-the
malay rod was quietly smoking a cigar

  it was his own fault he said indif-
ferently

  ted jarrett entered the little shanty a
wooden building with a galvanized iron
roof known by the grandiloquent title of the
cape york hotel just in time to pick up the
tag end of the story rod who was angry



at losing his commission declared that the
malays had run amok muda had not been
seen since he might have been in hiding
meditating revenge or perhaps he had
slipped away to the aroe islands after all

  the american ordered drinks for the
crowd the girl serving behind the bar was
a french girl from san francisco and ted
wondered how she came to be there in such
strange surroundings for there is no more
cosmopolitan crowd on earth than the
pearlers of torres straits

  a smiling chinese handed round the
drinks

  good luck cried the pearlers draining
their glasses

  good luck said jarrett

  in the bar-room were many races of
white men anglo-saxons danes russians
and different varieties of southern euro-
peans while in the streets could be found
chinese japanese indian mohammedans
singhalese malays kanakas filipinos
australian blacks and various nondescripts
white brown black yellow and every
shade between

  pearling is a fascinating pursuit and
draws adventurers from the ends of the
earth

  it had drawn ted jarrett from a lawyers
office in new york city and cast him into
the outer spaces ted was twenty-five
years old and already had been twice round
the world but each time on his return his
father gave him good sensible advice and
sent him back to the heavy law books which
he detested ted knew he would never cut
much of a figure in the legal profession so
on his fathers death three years before he


adventure

abandoned office work and spent most of
the little fortune he had inherited in a trade
enterprise in mexico but his heart was
not in the business and lie sold out at a loss

  ted was a big strong athletic young man
well educated and full of energy but too
good-natured to be a lawyer and too easy
going to make a successful merchant so
far he had failed in everything and evelyn
ward a young society beauty with whom
he thought he was in love told him one
summers evening after dinner at a stylish
broadway restaurant that unless he turned
over a new leaf and made a success of
something his attentions would be no longer
welcome

  teds face took on a sterner outline

  i suppose you think im a failure he
said

  the girl shrugged her shoulders

  what else can i think one cant live
on romantic dreams

  i was foolish enough to think that we
could ted replied with a dry laugh

  when they finally parted that night ted
had already made his plans though evelyn
had given him no definite promise she
would never marry a poor man for it
needed money and plenty of money to give
her the only life she cared about the gay and
brilliant life of new york society if he
failed there was no more to be said and if
he succeeded well he might take his chance
with the rest of her admirers

  next day ted put his affairs in order and
with a steamer ticket and a few thousand
dollars in his pocket caught the train for
frisco where lie meant to set out to seek
his fortune in the islands of the south

  for some months he knocked round the
islands making little more money than he
spent but enjoying life in his usual light-
hearted way but one night at suva in the
club he met a man who told him of the
pearling at torres straits and his imagina-
tion was so kindled that lie caught the next
boat for sydney and from there went
north past the great barrier reef to
thursday island a few days later he went
over to the mainland determined to fit out
a lugger and reap a rich harvest of pearls

  in the cape york hotel there was much
talk of sudden strokes of fortune good and
evil of thieving divers of the fatuity of
politicians and of the sin sweat and sorrow
of that particular torrid township

  the conversation like the crowd was

mixed but jarrett soon got his bearings

  he learned that on an average the shell
was as profitable as the pearls but every
man who went out in a lugger clung to the
hope that some unusually line pearls would
fall to his lot it was always the pearl that
might be not the shell that was that at-
tracted adventurous fieet-owners

  a dutchman from java and an italian
had a heated argument about the respective
merits of the aroe islands and torres
straits a good case was made for both
sides but an old queensland pearler main-
tained that the torres shell was the best hi
the world

  that will do for me then said jarrett

  but its harder to find remarked the
jewel-buyer

  all the more fun replied the young
american

  li the stolid chinese boy kept carry-
ing round the drinks

  the girl behind the bar who was called
suzette seemed to ted much too delicate a
picture for such a rough-set frame she
had an expressive face a clear skin tinted a
delicate olive by the sun eyes soft and
brown but with a merry laugh in them and
a great mass of blue-black hair her figure
was slight and graceful and ted could not
help noticing the good taste of her dress a
simple frock of some dark semi-transparent
material suitable for the tropics but with a
touch of coquetry in its scarlet belt that
matched the red flower in her hair

  leon rod a handsome middle-aged man
of unknown nationality-he might have
been anything for he had traveled the
world and spoke several languages fluently
-sat at a little table sipping a liqueur he
raised his glass to suzette

  a tes beaux yeuxl

  suzette wrinkled her dainty little nose

  rod walked over to the bar caught her
wrist and whispered something in french
suzettes cheeks blazed with shame and in-
dignation rod laughed and bent over to
kiss her when ted jarrett grabbed him by
the shoulders wheeled him round and then
pushed him violently to the door rod was
a heavy and powerful man but he was
taken by surprise by the americans quick-
ness and dexterity

  the crowd laughed at the little incident
but as leon rod stumbled out of the door
on to the veranda a revolver shot passed
just over his shoulder and buried itself in
the pearl of torres



the wall there was a rush to the door

  it was muda cried big bailey the
constable having a crack at rod

  there was a scene of disorder suzette
was forgotten the pearlers ran in different
directions but there was no sign of the
malay muda had escaped again

the lugger was drifting across
the glittering straits

  ted jarrett was now a full-blown
pearler it was a day of perfect beauty
and the thrill of the tropics fired his blood
pearling he thought was a splendid game
his money had gone but what of that a
good haul of shell would pay all expenses
and the pearls he found would be clear
profit

  he had leased the foreshore from a more
or less paternal government and used the
site for his own shack a shell shed and a
place for overhauling his boats

  ted felt rather pleased with himself
but what would evelyn think he won-
dered if she saw him in such a place and in
such a costume it would be difficult to
turn him into a society man again he
loved adventure untamed lands tropic
seas strange people and the big vague
dreams of the wanderer had he the soul
of a beach-comber after all

  this he bad to admit was the life that
suited him and though his financial position
was not exactly rosy he was in excellent
health and spirits his lugger was not yet
fully paid up and he was depending on a
haul to clear himself but he was a born
adventurer undaunted by circumstances
and buoyed up by the hopes of youth

  ted reveled in the pearling his lugger
fitted up with a dingey pump and diving-
gear had a small but resourceful crew he
was proud of utimaro a little jap who was
one of the most daring divers of torres
straits though slightly built utimaro
was strong and sinewy and there was no
question of his skill and courage he was
absolutely cold-blooded and if the prospects
were good there was no risk he would re-
fuse to take he was a silent little man
more respected than loved by the rest of the
crew why he had offered him his services
at a moderate wage was a mystery to
jarrett

  besides utimaro there was another jap
sato the tender whose job it was to
answer the divers signals and keep the

pipes and ropes free while he was under
water malays kept the pumps going
and the fifth man a levantine greek
who was no diver acted as cook and general
handy man

  the divers had struck a good patch of
shell utimaro returned from the bottom
of the sea with his bag filled and sat for a
moment enjoying the fresh breeze one of
the malays then stepped into the diving-
dress and was lowered down

  ted had admired the diving of utimaro
and his eyes still followed the little man who
went aft to the pile of shells he noticed
the jap had a piece of wire which he slipped
away quickly as ted crossed over

  whats that utimaro

   the jap looked up with a scowl

  whats the game

   the jap did not reply

   ted looked at the shells and found that
some had been stacked on edge in the sun so
that the oyster would open easily and allow
a big pearl to be fished for with a piece of
wire this was a favorite device with the
colored divers who have a good eye for an
oyster likely to contain a pearl

  thatll do utimaro said ted ill
open the rest myself

  now he knew why utimaro had been so
willing to work for him ted was a new
man at the game

  utimaro called one of the malays

   it was again the japs turn to dive

   utimaro looked over the ships side

   too deep he muttered at last it is not
the law

   there is a law against diving below a cer-
tain depth but utimaro had never been
known to refuse before his obvious in-
tention was to pay jarrett back for discover-
ing his tampering with the shells

  this is your last chance utimaro if
you quit now youll have to find another
job but the jap would not dive

  the shell was so good that ted jarrett
determined on going down himself he had
full confidence in his crew and knew the
malays would keep an eye on utimaro
when he got into the dress and the heavy
helmet was screwed on he felt far from
comfortable his cars buzzed then he
heard a loud bang caused by the com-
pressed air striking his ear-drums but
ted who had no thought of consequences
was going to see it through he stepped
down the ladder attached to the side of the


adventure

boat and then cast himself off he went
down to the bottom by the plumper which
along with the life-line was held by the
silent japanese bender

  when he reached the floor of the ocean
ted was dazzled by the enchantment of the
scene that looked as beautiful and unreal
as a fairy palace he saw the most ex-
quisite shells of every shape and color
trees made out of coral delicate fishes flash-
ing among the marine growths curious
flowers and ferns of the sea but he had no
time to indulge his sense of wonder he
kept his eyes fixed on one object only-shell

  overhead the lugger drifted dragging him
on and quickly he gathered the large oys-
ters and dropped them into his bag uti-
maro was right they had certainly struck a
patch ted filled his bag gave the signal
to be hauled up and rose quickly to the sur-
face sato unscrewed the helmet and ted
sat down exhausted eagerly filling his lungs
with the fresh air utimaro did not speak
but the malays grinned for the young
americans grit bad impressed them

  ted gave the word to return home lay
back exhausted on the deck and lit his pipe

  the lugger danced over the waves

  it was a day for dreams in the drowsy
tropic afternoon the scene was a picture of
delight with the burning blue of the sea
and sky the red beach at the foot of the
cliffs and the white roofs of the houses
peeping amid the vivid green foliage of the
coconut poinciana and the palm trees
the air was warm but a light breeze blew
across the sea

  ted sat up for some weeks luck had
gone against him there was not a pearl in
every shell ted soon discovered nor in
every hundred shells it was a gamble but
the lure was irresistible now he had dis-
covered utimaros trick his prospects
seemed brighter at any moment a man
might make a fortune

  with a flat thin-bladed knife he started
on the shells he had just dived for himself
the opening of every oyster was an exciting
experiment

  quickly he opened shell after shell put-
ting any gems he found into a little tin box

  he had suffered many disappointments
at first he thought that every oyster con-
tained a pearl of some kind and he mistook
every bright bubble for one often he
thought it was real till the knife proved his
error-the bubble burst

  the little box was half-filled with pearls
mostly baroques ill-shaped gems of com-
paratively small value yet serving to en-
courage the hope that the rare pearl
evelyns pearl might yet be found

  as he opened shell after shell finding
only a bubble or a baroque he would just
curse and tackle another pile

  better luck next time he would say

  as the lugger was nearing the shore he
picked up a big oyster inserted his knife at
the lip of the shell and cut through the
strong central muscle that bound the flat
and round sides together his knife
touched something that made his heart
jump with excitement

  it was a beautiful pearl it was big per-
fectly round with a smooth skin and deli-
cate iridescent luster ted could hardly
believe his eyes for never ijefore had he
seen anything like it there was no pearl
to match it in the gem-shops of thursday
island what was the worth of that little
sphere of nacre ted examined it care-
fully who could say a fine pearl is like
a fine picture it is something unique be-
yond price it becomes a matter of fancy
of artistic taste well if it were sold for
twenty twenty-five thirty thousand dol-
lars ted thought it would be cheap

  but he had no intention of selling this
pearl he had worked for it he had crossed
the world to find it he had dived for it him-
self and he felt proud of his efforts

  utimaro stood unobserved xhind him

  when ted looked up the jap was point-
ing to the little jetty the lugger was ap-
proaching

  at last ted reflected i have some-
thing to show a perfect pearl a queen of
gems worthy to hang as a pendant on the
white throat of a new york beauty

  the lugger touched the jetty

  ted hid the pearl in his belt

    i next evening as the moon was
rising ted jarrett stepped out
of his shack and ran down the
beach for a swim

  he told nobody of the precious pearl he
had found and he thought nobody knew
before going down to the sea he looked
carefully round the shack and slipped the
little leather bag containing the pearl
into a hole in the wall

  as he was enjoying liis swim sato the
japanese tender approached and when
the pearl of torres



ted came out of the water banded him a
note it came from new york and he
recognized evelyns handwriting

  as he hastily dressed he was surprised to
find how slightly moved he was new
york was very far away and somehow the
lights of broadway were less alluring than
the moonlight on the lonely sea

  he tore open the letter glanced at it
hastily and was about to return when
sato who had been waiting patiently
asked him a question about the lugger

  while he was reading the letter from new
york and giving sato some directions for
the next day a small brown figure which
had been hiding behind the low bushes at
the foot of the cliff crept into the shack
it was utimaro he went straight to the
hole in the wall opened the bag and took
out the pearl and then glided off into the
bushes like a snake into its hole he
wriggled along the sands till he reached the
cliff scrambled up the jagged rocks and
disappeared

  dismissing sato jarrett with the letter
in his hand returtied slowly and thought-
fully to the shack

  he threw himself into a low chair and
while the kettle was lxiling he again read
evelyns brief note it destroyed his last
illusions about her she took it for granted
that he was a failure as usual and would
never make a success of pearling shell
had fallen a hundred dollars a ton-she had
made inquiries she would be pleased
with a pearl from torres if it were a fine
one but fine pearls were rare and fortune
was not likely to favor him

  her light chatter of automobiles dances
and supper parties and the artificial plea-
sures that could be bought by wealth
jarred on the young man who saw clearly
that she was more interested in ms fortune
than in himself the pearl he had striven
for surely it was never destined for such a
cold and calculating woman

   as he sat dreaming for hours in the tropic
night he realized how strangely satisfied he
was with his lot he liked the life and the
motley adventurous crowd that gathered o
nights in the little shanty suzette who
was treated by the pearlers with a rough
but genuine courtesy seemed to take no
special notice of him after the incident
with rod he felt rather shy in her presence
keeping somewhat aloof with a chivalrous
care not to presume on her gratitude

   he often wondered at her refinement but
he learned that she was the daughter of a
cultured man though a neer-do-well a
french engineer who had traveled the
world seeking his fortune and at last come
to thursday island later he crossed to
cape york and opened the little hotel
though most of his time he spent pearling
one night his lugger went out but it never
returned that was two years ago su-
zette kept on the shanty saving her little
money so that she could return to her
mothers people in san francisco

   she was quite unlike the selfish super-
ficial evelyn she had known suffering
that was part of her charm the diamond
is struck from the hard inanimate rock but
the pearl is born of pain-that was the dif-
ference between them the new york girl
was hard cold brilliant a society beauty-
a diamond suzette was soft and subtle one
who had known suffering but with a depth
of color a delicate enchantment-a pearl

   yes a pearl he reflected the pearl of
torres

it was a quiet time in the cape
york hotel suzette was sitting in
a rocking-chair pensively knitting
when leon rod came in he seemed
greatly excited

  wine suzette he cried i must
drink

   suzette rose and brought a small bottle
of champagne the wine sparkled gaily in
the glass as he lifted it to his lips be
gazed boldly at suzette who flushed and
walked away

   leon rod laughed drained his glass and
called for more wine

   i have good news he said good news
cherie

  when suzette brought another bottle he
leaned across the table and spoke eagerly

  listen at last fortune lias been kind
to me i am going to leave this infernal
country i have seen enough too much
what have we here-fever heat flies dirt
-and as for the people theyre the very
scum of the earth bah its a terrible
life but im through with it do you hear
suzette i have my fortune and now
i go

   suzette watched him closely

  you have been buying pearls she
asked

  mais oui i have bought pearls


adventure

 where have they come from the
american has found very few

  leon rod lit a cigaret

  he has found very few he laughed
that is so

  you are much cleverer said suzette
moving away

  i am not a shell-hunter i am a con-
noisseur

  the jewel expert brought out a little case
from ins pocket he opened it and suzette
saw it was filled with a choice collection of
gems

  i am an expert he said these pearls
are small but very fine would they not
make a pretty necklace suzette

  rod was in an eager amorous mood and
suzette became curious as to his designs

  what are you going to do with the
pearls the girl asked

  i will sell them at the right time
  here

  no in the best market london paris
new york i have done with torres
how i have suffered in this hell-hole and
you must have suffered too suzette but
tomorrow i sail away singapore co-
lombo port said marseilles and then
paris paris-the boulevards the theaters
the cafes-paris think of that think what
paris means to a man of wealth that will
be my life will you come with me

  the girls eyes flashed

  the wine has gone to your head msieu
it is not the wine it is you ma belle
do you know utimaro

  oui msieu

  he too is one of my agents i have
fooled the american

  suzette trembled

  come let us have a glass together said
rod

  suzette hesitated a moment since the
night ted jarrett had defended her she had
thought only of him but her love was hid-
den deep in her heart like a pearl in the sea
she felt that it was hopeless yet now he was
being cheated she would risk anything to
find out rods schemes

  setting her teeth tight she brought a large
bottle of champagne and a glass for herself
she sat down at the little table opposite
leon rod who filled both glasses with the
sparkling wine suzette touched the glass
with her lips

  tell me about it she said it must
be amusing you are not drinking

  rod raised his glass

  gem-buying is an art he replied
jocosely it is much better than fitting
out a lugger i have the choice of the spoil
from many luggers and i buy very cheap
not always from the fleet owners you may
be sure it is a dangerous game now big
bailey is on the lookout but i have a little
arrangement with the best of the colored
divers

  ah that is how you manage said su-
zette with a little jerky laugh as she re-
filled his glass

  mais oui i love you suzette leon
rod leaned over the table trying to grasp
the girls hand tonight i am going to
buy one more pearl the finest of all

  who found it she asked

  leon rod winked knowingly

  utimaro he stole it from the ameri-
can rod who was now flushed with
wine whispered confidentially i shall meet
utimaro on the beach when i get the word
from sato

  is it a very fine pearl the girl inquired
innocently

  it is perfect i saw it only for a mo-
ment for the jap would not hand it over till
he got the money

  will you have to pay him a great
deal

  no how else can he sell it the
chinese store-keepers would know it was
stolen and give him little and nobody else
dares to buy from the colored divers they
all have to come to leon rod i am the
friend of the poor

  suzette was shivering with excitement
but she kept filling rods glass

  you will come with me he cried you
will voyage as my wife we will lead the
gay life ah paris paris

  at this moment sato came in handed
rod a slip of paper and then silently went
out rods eyes gleamed

  let me see cried suzette

  rod laughingly showed her the note
which was in code

  some of the pearlers were now entering
and suzette put away the champagne
glasses the men called for drinks and cards

  leon rod looked at his watch and pulled
himself together with a start he rose
crumpling the note in his hand and bowed
to suzette

  a demain he said significantly as he
left the room
the pearl of torres

i

  at once suzette called li the chinese
boy told him to look after the place and
then without pausing to slip a shawl over
her head she left the shanty and walked
quickly to the beach

the pearl of torres mur-
mured ted softly

his long reverie was interrupted by
a cry from suzette with loosened hair
and sparkling eyes she told her story rapidly
but clearly her pale hands flashing to and
fro in pretty and expressive gestures

  jarrett listened intently

  but i have the pearl he cried

  suzette looked surprised

  here it is he said taking the bag from
its hiding-place he opened it and started
the pearl was gone

  it is stolen cried suzette

  the young american smiled grimly so
utimaro had been spying on him but he
would recover that stolen pearl for it meant
something to him-now he looked at the
little french girl in admiration

  why have you done all this for me

  suzette seemed agitated

  i must go msieu

  as they were speaking they caught sight
of a small figure gliding along the beach
jarrett made a sudden move

  be careful whispered suzette

  ill see who it is said ted i want that
pearl

  keep to the cliff said suzette as she
hurried away adieu

  ted jarrett was too excited to notice how
she slipped off fixing his eyes on the small
brown figure whose movements were so sus-
picious he kept to the cliff walking behind
the bushes the man who was creeping
along the beach below by a familiar gesture
revealed himself to jarrett as the diver
utimaro

  it was before a cave in the rocks that
utimaro stopped and looked round in a
few minutes he was joined by another man
sauntering leisurely along and smoking a
fragrant cigar it was leon rod

  from his vantage ground on the cliff ted
jarrett could see them distinctly care-
fully he approached nearer hiding behind
some rocks and bushes till he hung straight
over the precipice the men had entered
the cave and were sitting on a boulder
for some time they looked closely at each
other but at last utimaro displayed the

 jewel and handed it over to the illicit
 buyer rod talked volubly offering a
 price but the face of the jap was set and
 stern

 it will not do he said

 but let me explain utimaro-

 no explanation

 rod held up the pearl

 it is big and has a good skin that i ad-
 mit-but it is not perfect i am an ex-
 pert

 i too said the jap with a scowl

 my best price is one hundred pounds
 five snapped the jap

 impossible my friend impossible
 utimaro remained silent then he held
 out his hand

 give me the pearl i no sell

 rod put it in his pocket

 listen utimaro he said holding out a
 bank note take your money

 no i will have the pearl it is
 mine

 listen

 the jap rose quietly

 we talk no more he said

 rod knocked the ash from his cigar

 the pearl cried utimaro making a
 spring but rod was too quick for him
 his hand was on his automatic and he
 fired

 utimaro fell against the boulder blood
 spurting from his throat

 when rod saw that utimaro was dead he
 left the body where it fell and stepped
 quickly out of the cave he threw the in-
 criminating weapon far into the sea and set
 out along the sand

 jarrett followed and as the beach made a
 sudden curve about a quarter of a mile from
 the cave he swung himself over the edge of
 the cliff and dropped lighdy on to the
 sand rod started as jarrett met him face
 to face

 what do you want he cried angrily
 my pearl said jarrett

 rod who though slower in movement was
 the heavier man closed with him and to-
 gether they swayed backward and forward
 each trying in vain for a successful throw
 at last jarrett broke away and met his
 opponents rush with a straight left some
 blows were exchanged and then jarrett
 making a feint tempted rod to smash in
 a heavy right but the blow fell short and
 jarrett making the most of his chance
 landed a well-timed hook on the point of the


adventure

jaw the big man staggered and fell
heavily

  jarrett waited for him to rise but rod
did not move his eyes were shut and
jarrett thought it was a knock-out blow
as he bent over and took the jewel from
rods pocket suddenly a knife flashed in his
face gashing his forehead it was a treach-
erous blow but the ruse succeeded rod
cautiously raised himself and picked up the
fatal pearl

  jarrett lay helpless on the sands and then
lost consciousness

back in the shanty suzette be-
came impatient the american
had not returned she confided
her fears to big bailey the police officer
who immediately made ready for action

  ive had my eye on rod for some time
he said this ilhcit pearl buying is turn-
ing too many good divers into thieves and
ruining the industry

  ill go with you said suzette

  come along then he growled in a
bluff good-natured way

  they left the pearlers drinking and play-
ing cards slipped out quietly and made for
the beach

  as they reached the cliffs they were
startled by the splendor of the tropic moon-
light that bathed the lonely sea and shore in
brilliant light the night was soft but as
dear as day and every object could be
plainly distinguished suzette uttered a
little cry her heart beating fast on the
sands two figures had been struggling she
recognized ted jarrett the young ameri-
can and leon rod kneeling beside the
body

  rod picked up the pearl and then rose
and walked quickly along the beach but
he did not go far a little boat touched the
shore a dark figure rushed out came be-
hind rod and plunged a kris between his
shoulder blades rod fell forward on the
sand and stirred no more

  it was a weird scene

  quick cried suzette

  as they stood on the cliff the dark figure
made for the sea it was muda the ma-
lay he seemed to know what he was
doing he got into his little boat and
pushed off across the glassy sea

  bailey helped suzet te down the cliff-side
the girl ran along the wet sand in her thin
little shoes she bent over the body of

 jarrett who opened his eyes and smiled

bon dieu exclaimed suzette with a
sigh of relief

 jarrett staggered to his feet he looked
 ghastly in the moonlight with his white face
 and his hair clotted with blood yet his
 wound was not so deadly as it appeared to
 suzette the knife had struck the bone
 but it had not penetrated it was an ugly
 gash but it would soon heal

big bailey was examining the body of
rod when ted jarrett leaning on suzettes
arm managed to stumble across the sands

 i sure knocked him out he said bewil-
 dered at the sight but dont say i killed
 him

 hes dead all right replied bailey
 but dont you worry we saw the
 finish

 suzette pointed over the sea where the
 malay was far out in his little boat

muda took a hand said bailey a
malay is a man of one idea and he has a
long memory muda waited for his
chance

jarrett picked up the pearl it was a
beauty as it gleamed in the moonlight

 how lovely exclaimed suzette

 it is for you said jarrett

 non non msieu 

 mais oui jarrett persisted but his
 small stock of inferior french soon gave out
 so he whispered something in her ear in his
 own language

 big bailey a diplomat in his way had
 turned his back on the pair and was looking
 across the sea

 the girl shook her head

you must keep this pearl of torres
she said you have fought for it and won
it

 you are the pearl of torres he said
 softly you are the only pearl i want

 suzette blushed

 well cried the americandesperately
 if you wont take the pearl will you take
 me

 suzette did not reply but the light in her
 eyes told him what he wanted to know

 big bailey half turned round remarking
 casually

hes making for one of the islands
guess ill let him go

 the night was calm the sea a mirror of
 silver the malays boat was now a speck
 in the distance muda had had his
 revenge

ttle pawnee village on -
the upper reaches of the ar-
kansas was preparing to pass
the pipe from left to right the
order observed in a medicine smoke and
black buffalo as murty the trader was
called a close companion of chief white
hair knew the tribal rules would not per-
mit his attendance so while white hair
and the priests and leading men filed into
the medicine lodge the trader rode down the
river trail to the sod-house he and joe clay
had used for four years as a tradmg-post
before leaving the village he promised
white hair he would return with whisky
after the medicine had been made

  in truth the pawnees on the arkansas in
the spring of  were in need of strong
medicine in the preceding fall they had
exterminated a small band of dakota
hunting buffalo on the republican and a
fear of reprisal had held the village back
from securing its own supply of meat it
was imperative that their maize and beans
and pumpkins return bumper crops this
year

  claiming all the territory from the niobra
on the north to the arkansas in the south
it resulted they were almost constantly at
war with the mighty siouan tribes above the
platte or with the osage comanche
arapaho or kiowa on the south and west
one or several of these tribes was repeated-
ly assailing them they returned blow for
blow and held their own till the white man
opened his long trail through their country
to the southwest when although they did
not yet realize it their fate as a warring
nation was sealed

  murty and clay were types of the fear-
less men who ventured far beyond the fron-
tier they risked their lives just as did
the half-wild mountain-men as the
trappers were styled but while the same
vital element of dauntless courage held
trader and trapper to their hazardous call-
ings the latter was often sustained by his
lust for adventure his love for penetrating
the unknown the trader was a sullen rock
stubbornly holding his place and risking all
for dross the only bond between murty
and his partner was their mutual love of
profits

  murty was a huge swart animal as cruel
and primitive as his boon companions the
savages clay was from new hampshire
and would always be an alien to the wild
environment of the arkansas he dared
all his partner dared without possessing
the latters brutal disregard for danger
murty found indian life and manners pe-
culiarly satisfying to his crude tastes he
had no visions of returning east and
sloughing off his wild ways clay frail of
physique was upheld by a fixed desire to
gain wealth for what it would purchase
hi the land of wooden houses he dreamed
much of his amiable native hills when
he fraternized with the savages it was
from motives of policy he did not like
them they tolerated him because of his
partner

  the lack of harmony between the two had
rapidly grown pronounced during the last
half-year clay insisted that by identi-
fying themselves so closely with white
hairs people they were incurring the hatred
of the other tribes more than once he

e




adventure

complained because murty took some part
in a daring raid bedecked and painted like
a pawnee a gay handkerchief concealing
the only attribute lacking in his appearance
-the peculiar scalp-lock standing erect
like a horn on such occasions of fault-
finding murty advised him to mind his own
business and continued spending his time
at the village

  for two years clay had planned to sever
his connections with murty and return
east a double motive restrained him
his greed for one more seasons profits and
his fear of attempting the long journey
down the arkansas alone murty appreci-
ating his uncanny genius for trade con-
tinually painted the horrors sure to over-
take him did he set out alone

  if it want fr me ye wouldnt last ten
minutes without a knife through yer ribs
he was wont to sneer when clay voiced his
desire to cjuit the soul-blighting vocation

  sometimes when half-drunk he dropped
more ominous words and led clay to infer
he was not even safe from the pawnees
once he broke off with black buffalo the
day he returned from the village to await
the end of the medicine smoke he drank
heavily and brought up the old subject of
clays withdrawal he was in an unusually
nasty mood clay suddenly declared he
would not spend another winter on the
river with a string of oaths murty
promptly retorted he would withdraw his
protection if he heard any more o that

  in desperation clay flared back

  you keep piling it on that if i want to
live ive got to agree to everything you say
be i your slave or not

  heretofore murty had taken care not
to goad his partner too far but the trade
whisky had destroyed his sense of pro-
portion and he roughly replied

  i reckon thats bout th size of it if
yere a free man strike out fr th settle-
ments

  clay made no response to this challenge
with sickening force the truth came home
to him throughout the day he silently
sat in the doorway while murty drank and
slept next morning murty was early
astir and galloping up the trail clay
cleared away the tin plates and sat down
outside the door and smoked and thought
he had shied away from the ugly fact now
he faced it he was murtys slave

  should he start alone down the river a

host of redskins probably led by his part-
ner would soon overtake him should he
by some rare chance win free to the settle-
ments he must go empty-handed all the
furs piled up in the post and cached in a
small cave across the river would remain
an undivided spoil for his partner a
great misery settled over his soul he was
home-sick for the east

  his yearning to go back home had been
uncommonly keen that spring he had
visited the village when the first rumble
of thunder initiated the series of sacred
ceremonies which the pawnees would keep
up till winter he did not go again that
season for four years he had stuck to
the post wearing his soul threadbare now
he was weary of it all weary unto death
on first coming to the country he had been
mildly interested in the practices and
beliefs of the indians

  white hair-so called because of a
streak of grayish-white hair through the
middle of his scalp-lock-was more astute
than the average savage but clay ab-
stemious by nature quickly sickened of
his drunken orgies with murty he in-
wardly derided as the priests proclaimed
the supreme power of tirawa his mind
though tainted retained its new england
poise it returned to the old order of
thought more insistently as the years
passed whereas he had laughed at the
heathenish nonsense now he hotly
spurned it

  when he first discovered his partners
credulity concerning the pawnee belief
hi supernatural animals he had felt amused
by degrees he came to resent it

  murty thought like an indian their
pagan beliefs found a quick response in
his crude mind he combined the credulity
of the child and the ferocity of the brute
his first serious quarrel with clay resulted
from the latters contemptuous comments
on a nahurac lodge-a place where the
pawnee believed animals met to hold
councils murty firmly believed white
hairs old father had been placed under
the protection and tutelage of bears when
a child which accounted for certain alleged
bear traits in his old age

  clay ridiculed such notions and absorbed
nothing from his savage environment except
a trick of throwing a sprig of cedar on the
fife when the tempest scoured the valley
of the arkansas there was no doubt in
the skidi feed the evening star



his mind but that cedar would turn light-
ning aside

  tie pocketed his pipe but continued
scowling at the wooded loneliness of the
river bank how he hated it not only
was he murtys slave but also the slave
of ever ash thicket and cotton-wood
growth of every indian whim and super-
stition he hated the somber wood the
emptiness of the river the earth lodge
behind him he even hated the tiny patch
of beans and pumpkins he had planted back
of the post

  -him im his nigger sure enough

he finally exploded aloud ive lost four
years of life just to live out here and work
for him if i make a break hell cut my
throat in a second ive got to wait here
till he dies

  he fell back from the sinister prompting
this last thought engendered yet the
idea persisted and fascinated even while
frightening him

  there was no doubt about it he pos-
sessed the power to terminate murtys evil
influence all he needed to do was to place
a fresh percussion cap on the rifle inside
the door there was never a minute when
they were together that murty was on his
guard and it was such a simple expedient
for five minutes the potentials of the homi-
cide braced him up and gave him an air of
dignity as he pictured himself the master
of his own fate murty stood between him
and a return home but murty could be
eliminated at any time

  an inner voice taunted-

  but how would you get away after kill-
ing him

  his vision of freedom flew to pieces to
kill murty would bring the whole pawnee
nation down on him and murty knew
this and knew his victim would not dare
rebel

  wouldnt do at all clay whispered
my hide wouldnt be safe a second after
hes wiped out

  however the notion of murtys taking-
off had found root in his mind and grew
sturdily even if like a weed it grew pur-
poselessly

  then there evolved from his fear and
hate another conviction some time murty
would decide to move on and when he did
he would take all the furs to avoid any
dispute with his partner he would kill him
yes siree he opines im nothing but

a slave hell use me then hell do for
me

  an hour later his last obsession had so
depressed him that he decided to break his
rule and ride to the village and observe what
murty was up to

nearly three hundred years be-
fore the pawnee people lured coro-
nado from new mexico across the
plains to this same country could clay
have looked ahead fourteen years as he rode
along the wild trail he would have seen
general kearney leading his troops along
the river path on his way to santa fe
and keamey was to find the region as
unsettled and primitive as had the con-
quistador the west stood unchanged for
centuries awaiting the white mans roads
to shatter the savage fastnesses and pave
the way for plow and homestead clay
would have scorned such a suggestion he
believed the west must continue barbarous
and repelling for further centuries vast and
un tameable

  he passed well-known bluffs and woods
and grassy intervals thickly dotted with
whitening buffalo skulls only now he was
sensing danger where before he had found
only monotony and heart-sickness so long
as he had considered murty a protection
against the fickle savages he had spleneti-
cally condemned the country but had not
feared his new angle of vision unraveled
all his former assurances of personal safety

  some cows and their calves headed by
an old bull crossed his trail to make the
river several white wolves slunk along
behind them it was a familiar sight
observed hundreds of times before now
it took on a new significance and seemed
to picture his own position he was as
helpless as one of the calves did the wolves
once get it alone he jumped from con-
clusion to conclusion till he convinced
himself murty had planned his death from
the beginning of their partnership

  he recalled the mans reticence to discuss
former trading ventures nor could he
remember he ever had mentioned a partner
and yet when in a genial mood murty
frequently declared that the ideal com-
bination was a man like himself to mix
with the indians and win their good-will
with another like joey clay to stick at
the trading-post and keep the accounts

  hell do for me sures lightning


adventure

muttered clay yes siree and hes
done for others before i met him i was
a fool not to find out something about him
before coming out to this gawd-forsaken
spot hes probably waiting till the moun-
tain men fetch in their next batch of furs
hell want me to handle the rush then
somethingll happen to j clay but if
something should happen to him first

- whats the use he knows im a

goner the minute he drops out of the game-
that is unless the pawnees wipe him out
and i have time and luck enough to git
away

  but the idea of the pawnees killing their
good friend black buffalo was too fan-
tastical to entertain still the notion
bobbed up at times if only to tantalize
his ingenuity by challenging him to imagine
some combination of circumstances wherein
such a wholesome solution might be pos-
sible the only thing he could think of
was a fight between murty and the chief
while drunk but they had been drunk
together many times and had never quar-
reled

  white hairs people were skidi pawnee
also known as the wolf pawnee and by
the french as the pawnee loup they
held the inside of the circle against many
hostile tribes only by great sacrifice of man-
power and by their ability to keep them-
selves constantly supplied with fresh horses
thus their means of defense-locomotive
power-was also a continuing cause for
new wars and they stole horses from the
black hills to the great range of the
comanche now the immigrants were
passing through their country they became
especially active in stampeding stocks from
the trains

  clay was shrewd enough to see the
pawnees were playing a losing game and
that his partner had done better had he
pitched his post among the powerful
dakota this also had been a stock
argument between them when murty
stripped to breech-cloth and moccasins
painted for war joined his red friends in
some raid murtys contention was very
simple the pawnees were great fighters
therefore they would hold their own for
many years

  what happens to em arter i croak
aint worryin me any he would conclude
the debate by saying

  just as a more important personage once

remarked he didnt care how heavily it
rained after his day closed

  now that clay viewed the pawnees as his
potential murderers he took notice of details
as he slowly rode into the village murty
was lounging before white hairs lodge
watching a procession of priests escorting
a comely woman about the village clay
remained on his horse as the little band
approached the chiefs lodge the woman
prompted by the priests asked for gifts
white hair listened to her gravely and
gave her a small bundle of painted sticks
the woman smiled and thanked him and
was led away murty discovered his part-
ner and without a trace of their morning
quarrel boisterously called out

  jest in time fr th fun joey hop
down

  clay dismounted thrilled by a wild hope
that he had misjudged murty the man
was hopelessly coarse and brutal but so long
as his soul was leavened by an appreciation
of the humorous he could not be wholly
evil murty stared after the priests and
the woman and exploded in a loud
laugh

  whats the idea murt genially asked
clay his narrow face twisting into a pro-
pitiating grin

  that fool squaw chuckled murty
shes comanche caught in a raid bout
a month ago she dont know th medicine
smoke warned white hair to sacrifice to
th mornin star mornin stars a man
joey so they allers sacrifice a woman to
him they dont do it reglar this is
th furst time since we opened th post
but ive watched em do it at other villages
afore i met ye a sure medicine to make
th corn grow ye know

  the last was said seriously as befitting
the expression of a self-evident truth

  but she laffed exclaimed clay in-
credulously

  thats th funny part of it she dont
know whats goin to happen she thinks
its all a game replied murty it has
to be done that way or th medicine
wouldnt be no good theyve treated her
bettern her own people did she likes
here bettern she did to home today
they dress her up an tell her to ask fr
presents at each lodge every lodge gives
her some dry wood she wont guess
whats up till they come to sacrifice her an
bury her in th cornfields
the skidi feed the evening star



  good heavens theyll kill her
gasped clay

  none o that ominously warned murty
from the corner of his mouth want to
make th chief here thinkin yere agin his
medicine theyve got to have corn aint
they

  but burying a dead woman wont make
corn grow expostulated clay his soul
sick and quivering

  th devil it wont growled murty his
brows growing black think all th real
medicine is made east o th mississippi
this village cant go north arter bufler
till th dakotas git over that last raid on th
republican if they raise a big crop o
corn they can trade it with some o th other
tribes fr meat this medicine is extry
sure i know what im talkin bout
you can stay and watch the devils
work but im going back to the post
muttered clay the sweat now trickling
down his thin face and he mounted his
horse hurriedly to be off before the terrible
ceremony began he paused onlyjlo say-
tell white hair ill give him two kegs
of whisky for the woman

  an git knifed fr meddlin with his
medicine snorted murty nothin but
a regiment o soljers could stop it i
shant be home fr a few days keep a
close watch fr dakota scouts

  clay rode like a mad man till far beyond
the village he had heard stories of the
skidi sacrifice to the morning and evening
stars but had accepted them as legends
just as he did the stories about the nahurac
lodges and children brought up by bears
the village never a prepossessing spot in
his estimation now became a foul murder
trap what would they not do with him
should murty give the word

five days passed before murty
returned to the post clay greeted
him warmly but studied him
stealthily murty was unusually bois-
terous in his bearing and yet he had not
been drinking he was effusively cordial
clay quickly decided this exaggerated
joviality was a mask every now and
then he betrayed himself by quick sidelong
glances each man was stalking the other
only murty was clumsy at it

  clay shivered as his partner began follow-
ing him about always keeping behind him
then without knowing why he should re-

  shape his suspicions clay concluded his
partner was acting thus in order to cover
up something murty talked garrulously
about his absence and took pains to dwell
on the fact he had been at the pawnee
village all the time

  hoping to induce him to betray himself
in some way clay took the water pails
and went toward the river once inside
the narrow leafy tunnel he halted and
watched till murty furtively appeared in
the doorway and after a searching scrutiny
of the woods hastened to the ash growth
back of the post

  dropping the pails clay swiftly circled
back and came upon his partner so un-
expectedly that only the latters abstraction
prevented a discover murty was kneel-
ing at the foot of a big boulder and fumbling
with moss and dry grass finally he rose
his fierce eyes ranging the surrounding
cover suspiciously for a moment then
he ran swiftly toward the post clay
knew his life hung in the balance should
murty continue on to the river and find
the abandoned pails but there was no
resisting the shivery curiosity alternately
freezing and burning his blood he crawled
to the rock and thrust his arm and hand
into a deep cleft

  he pulled forth a cross made of gold
beads several finger-rings of gold and a
handful of gold coins there were more
coins in the hole a small mound of them
something like a galvanic shock jolted
him the treasure trove was crushing him
with hideous suggestions

  restoring the stuff and carefully re-
placing the moss and grass he scuttled like
a frightened shadow back to the river
path breathless with fear he came to
the pails was murty behind him at the
post unsuspicious of his spying or had
he entered the path and found the pails
as clay sped on down to the river bank
he had no idea whether he was hastening
to his death or was safe for the time being

  he reached the bank and hurriedly filled
the pails expecting every moment to
behold murtys sardonic visage leering
at him from the undergrowth nothing
happened and he threw himself on the
bank and made sure the horse-pistol in
his belt slipped easily by degrees his
heart quieted and his breathing became
normal

guess hes been trading with the pawnee


adventure

on the sly for that gold hes holding out
on me

  there was a ray of hope in this reasoning
for if murty purposed killing him he would
scarcely bother to conceal any assets the
thought was vastly comforting till he re-
membered that murty had withdrawn no
goods from the post it was clay who kept
the accounts and who was in position to
abstract goods and trade on his own ac-
count murty had no more finesse in such
matters than a gorilla

  if he got the stuff from the injuns he
aint paid for it yet he concluded

  o-e-e jo-ey loudly called murty
and clays legs twitched convulsively

  ah right here i be clay bawled
back assuming a lazy attitude with his
right hand resting or his right hip

  murty clumped down the path whistling
imitations of bird calls

  ye aint been alone nough yet but
what ye want to sneak off an leave yer old
pard he chided with what was intended
for an amiable grin

  been watching something across in the
bushes grunted clay pointing his pistol
toward the opposite shore reckon its a
antlope

  yed never land him with that said
murty i dont see no signs

  right straight across tops of the
bushes moved mebbe its gone now
and he rose still toying with the pistol

  murty stooped and picked up the two
pails his head passing close to clays face
there was red paint back of his ears and
at the roots of his long black hair clays
heart skipped several beats

 what did you do after i quit the
village he carelessly inquired

  murty darted him a suspicious glance
and carelessly replied

  jest took it lazy an chinned with white
har he wants me to go on a bufler hunt
reckons id be big medicine agin th
dakota

  clay hesitated then forced himself to
ask-

 the comanche woman

  sure they got to have corn

  clay shuddered and shifted his thoughts
to the gold cross under the boulder murty
iied when he said he had been at the village
the paint and the unusual loot proved he
had been on a raid no indian possessed
such trinkets unless he had massacred

  whites an awful loathing of the swart-
visaged man filled the little new eng-
landers soul something horrible had been
enacted and the coins and the cross testified
to murtys complicity how easy it would
be to eliminate the man from all further
consideration by the simple process of
raising his pistol and pulling the trigger a
child could do it

  dont wave that gun so keerless-like
joey ye make me nervous remon-
strated murty

  clay colored and thrust the pistol into
his belt murty was dull of wit but he had
absorbed enough from the savages to be
abnormally intuitive

  to cover his confusion he faced the
opposite bank and regretted-

  wish i had my rifie and a antlope
would pop into sight

  he had scarcely spoken when the bushes
across the river swayed violently but
instead of an antelope the figure of a man
staggered down the bank and raised both
hands in supplication

  - yelled murty dropping the pails

and snatching the pistol from his belt

  hes white yelled clay knocking up
the weapon as it exploded derned fool
cant you see its a white man all tuckered
out

  for a moment murty glared murder at
his partner then hoarsely conceded
derned if it aint thought it was a
dakota scout

  clay passed over the clumsy excuse
the tattered figure would not deceive even
a greenhorn into thinking it an indian
at the sound of the shot the man fell to
his knees clay waved his hand and yelled
hi come across waters shallow a few
rods up-stream thought you was a hos-
tile

  the man lurched to his feet and made
for the ford murty watched him with
wolfish eyes his ups drawing back and
disclosing long teeth much as a beast
of prey views the approach of a victim
and clay watched murty

  the newcomer was barely able to crawl
up the bank he was dressed in tatters
and tags of homespun and had lost his
boots a scrubby growth of sandy beard
accentuated rather than concealed the
frozen expression of terror on his long
snuff-colored face

  save me he groaned and clay caught
the skidi feed the evening star



his arm and prevented him from falling
back into the river

 save ye from what who be ye
where ye from questioned murty

  wagon train jumped dog crick all
kilt wailed the stranger my names
bowls

  seems ye want kilt growled murty
when was ye jumped howd ye git
away

  two nights ago i was out arter a
stray hoss injuns at work when i come
back i kept low in th grass gawdfrey
such doins

  well well you aint hurt yet and youre
safe now soothed clay the horripilation
of his scalp subsiding only when he remem-
bered his pistol was loaded while murtys
was empty if the wretched creature
before him had displayed any fortitude he
would have believed him sent by providence
to be a companion down the arkansas
he had an insane desire to ask if any
women in the train wore beads in the form
of a cross

  you aint hurt and murty here my
partner is worth a whole tribe of injuns
murty worked his face into a less
ferocious expression and declared

  bet ye was jumped by dakota no
southern injuns up this way an th
pawnees aint stirred from their village fr
a long time yas joey its dakota work
all right that means ive got to hustle
to white hars village an warn him th
dakotas have come sit tight at th post
an keep yer eye peeled ill be back to-
night or tomorrer

  i could hear em swearin an screamin
th menn women mumbled bowls as
murty disappeared up the path

  many women folks in th outfit whis-
pered clay

th wagon-boss woman an th wives
o five missouri men im from ohio
thank th lawd there want no children
did they take the women prisoners
shivered clay

  not so bad as that returned bowls
pumping up each word with great difficulty
a bit of a pause and he ran on th
injuns passed near me me flat in thgrass
some of em had ripped burnin cloth from
th wagons an they kept wavin it as they
rode one o th injuns talked in english
clay seized him by the shoulders and
shook him till his head rocked

  never repeat that if you want to
keep on living never while on the arkansas
let on you was near enough to see the
injuns you heard firing and ran for it
and thats all understand

  i reckon muttered bowls but one
of em id know agin if i ever seen him
passed within twelve feet o me wavin
a parcel o burnin cloth had a queer
twisted face and his scalp-lock had a streak
o white paint through it

  clay caught his arm and stole a fright-
ened glance up the narrow path and softly
asked

  the injun who talked english would
you know him again

  no i couldnt tell him agin face
jest plastered over with red paint and
he wore a hanker round his head he
rode side o th injun with th streaked
hair

  clay drew a deep breath and warned
listen im your friend dont never
speak of it to my partner he gits excited
easy remember

  with that he took the pails and refilled
them and led the way to the post murty
had gone without a word clay took
down a rifle and loaded it and put on a
percussion cap and thrust it into bowls
hands next he thrust a pistol and knife
into the rope that served the immigrant
for a belt then he looked after his own
rifle and added a knife and second pistol
to his own belt

  now were ready to eat a snack you
look kind of peaked he said

pethe religious ceremonies of the
ntrr pawnees reflected their veneration
ess-jof cosmic forces and their worship of
the heavenly bodies tirawa father
held all power and executed his will through
the phenomena of lightning and thunder
wind and rain the universe was dual
masculine and feminine

  now the priests were declaring the stars
continued maleficent despite the recent
sacrifice of the comanche woman white
hair heard them with surprise for was not
the village much richer from the raid on
the immigrant train

  the dakotas are coming explained
the priest

  o-pit-i-kut has had a woman sacrificed
protested white hair

  the morning star is satisfied but the


adventure

evening star has had no sacrifice replied
the priest

  a man shall be sacrificed to her said
white hair

  red flesh will not please the flesh
must be white warned the priest

  white hair will bring white flesh was
the laconic assurance

  the chief spoke confidently yet he was
worried the dakotas traveled fast his
young men had been reporting their progress
ever since sunrise the sacrifice must be
made at once if the impending evil was to
be avoided he lamented his negligence
in not taking some of the immigrants alive
he had wished to do so but his friend
insisted there should be no prisoners and
it might be several moons before another
train could be surprised and captured

  the priest guessed his perturbation and
reminded-

  there is white flesh near the little
trader who lives with the black buffalo
i will tell black buffalo when he comes
he grows tired of the little trader

  our medicine says we must sacrifice
before the sun sleeps a second time
warned the priest send after the little
trader

  white hair sprang to a horse saving
the victim must not know he is to be
sacrificed till brought to the painted cross
i will go to the black buffalo and bring him
and the little trader back with me i will
ride outside of the trail and meet any
of our scouts who have seen the dakotas
since the first runners came in

  because of his slight detour toward the
open prairie white hair missed meeting
murty on the river trail and arrived at
the trading-post shortly after his friend
set out for the village bowls was first
to see the indian approaching and with a
squeal of terror crawled behind some
buffalo- robes clay advanced to the door
to greet the chief

 leaping from his horse white hair
strode to the door and pushing clay aside
entered expecting to find murty at the
bottle or asleep

  where is the black buffalo he de-
manded his sharp gaze noting the two
rifles and the weapons in clays belt

  on his way to little pawnee village
growled clay his pale eyes lighting venom-
ously at the overbearing demeanor of the
chief

  white hair reached behind the short
counter and found murtys bottle and
drained it clay was consumed with rage
this liberty violated all ethics of trade

  waugh grunted white hair smacking
his lips black buffalos friend will go
to the village now black buffalo wants
him

  you scum you just showed you dont
know where black buffalo is cried clay
in english then in- the chiefs tongue
if black buffalo wants me he will come
for me or send a talking paper

  the rank liquor registered quickly on
the indian and maniacal lights shone in
his black eyes a white man must be
sacrificed to the evening star the eve-
ning star was jealous and the dakota
were advancing were there no other
white man available the chief would have
sentenced black buffalo himself

  come he ordered and his crest of
black and gray hair seemed to bristle
the medicine pipe has passed from left
to right black buffalo says for you to
come

  you have not seen black buffalo i
stay here boldly replied clay

  with a guttural growl of rage white
hair seized him about the waist and was
carrying him to the door when a terrified
sallow visage emerged from behind the
robes and a scrawny arm shaking spas-
modically sought to aim a long-barreled
pistol clay held helpless and glaring
over the chiefs shoulder yelled

  git it closer git nearer

 with a puppy whine of fear bowls
crawled to his feet white hair caught
the alarm and dropping his captive spun
about

  th injun i seen shrieked bowls and
he closed his eyes and fired just as the chief
leaped upon him

  both crashed to the earthen floor clay
pulled his rescuer from the savage and
stood him on his feet bowls still retained
the smoking pistol and stared from it to
the silent figure sprawled out at his feet

  you done for him panted clay hardly
able to comprehend the miracle

  bowls dropped the weapon and whim-
pered

  th injun with th painted hair is he

dead

  clay by this time began to realize their
predicament with a snarl of fear he
the skidi feed the evening star



jumped to the door and glared up and down
the trail there was no one in sight
turning to the stupefied immigrant he
commanded

  help me git him outer here oh lawd
what wont they do to us if they find
him

  i knew him when i seen his hair
shivered bowls reckon i killed him

  catch hold of his heels you fool he
cant hurt you

  it seemed as if they never would cross
the narrow opening and gain the shelter
of the woods only by fearful imprecations
could clay hold bowls to the grim task
till they reached the river bank directing
him to procure some stones for weights
clay crouched beside the dead chief and
tried to think as his mind cleared he
could foresee the wild excitement and mad
search for the chief four years on the
arkansas had taught the trader many
things he knew the pawnees would quickly
trace their leader to the post and at once
read the signs on the floor and along the
river path

  they must have known he was coming
here he muttered essaying to make a
summary of all the evidence he come
to see murty so he mustapassed him on
the way the village dont know but what
they met murty wants to be shet of me
and the chief was going to take me to the
village  said the pipe had passed from
left to right theyve made new medicine
and i figgered in it some way by the
lawd harry theyll soon have a white
scalp for this streaked one murtys or
mine but the village dont know him
and murty didnt meet if they thought
the two met-

  he was still nursing his inspiration when
bowls staggered up with an armful of
rocks

  gimme that rope round your waist
clay ordered then go up the path and
watch if any one comes to the post dont
show yourself my partnerll be back
soon ive got a plan but it depends on
whether he comes alone or not if injuns
come with him we must both hide if he
comes alone ill see him but you stay hid
git

  after bowls departed clay sat for some
moments testing the edge of his knife
with his thumb and working himself up to
perform a very disagreeable task

murty arrived at the village just
as the priests and leading men
began another medicine smoke a
young buck informed him that white hair
had gone to the trading-post without
dismounting the trader galloped down the
trail he could not understand why he
had not met the chief an animal instinct
was telling him something was radically
wrong it was imperative that he find the
chief and arrange for a band of his braves
to swoop down and capture the immigrant
and clay at first he had thought to wait
and spare clay till after the fall season
closed but he fancied his partner was
growing suspicious a clean sweep was
best

  leaping from his horse he ran to the post
calling the chiefs name clay met him at
the door inquiring-

  what you yelling about

  white hair where is he

 come and went stirred up about
something drank half a bottle of your
whisky and then reckoned hed take a
package of presents back to his squaw
said something about you gitting moren
your share

  murty flushed beneath his heavy tan and
barked-

  the fools drunk

  of course turned down most a quart
i wouldnt let him have any presents till
you said so thought first he was going
to knife me but he cleared out a-yelling
how the devild be to pay if his squaw
didnt git them presents in a rush mebbe
i oughter give them to him most wish
i had after he quit and clay pointed
to a package of trade gee-gaws and squaws
finery on the counter fixed them up
after he went hellytowhooping according
to his say the dakotas will be here soon and
i guess well need his help or else take to
the timber

  murty swore fiercely he was worried
about the dakotas to run for it meant
the loss of four years profits and the
forfeit of the pawnees friendship what
with the danger of the dakotas and his own
private homicide plans he was rather un-
certain just what to do

  ive done nothing but miss the fool
he raved hes got to be found at once
hes got to lead his men agin th dakotas
an hit em hard afore they strike th
arkansas or well all be wiped out you


adventure

did right joey in not letting him have
the goods he mustnt git the notion he
can come an help himself but well
take them up to him yell be safer at
the village till we know how the game is
goin with th dakota git yer hoss

  if you think best meekly assented
clay passing over the parcel of gifts
but well be leaving bowls

  aint he round here cried murty
hes too white-livered to go far no we
didnt oughter leave him behind give him
a hoot

  clay rushed out and yelled the immi-
grants name repeatedly

  no use he puffed wait for me and
ill ride down the trail a piece dont leave
me alone

  this was a masterstroke for murty
wild with impatience to find the chief and
perfect a fighting unit to surprise the
dakota was no longer doubtful as to clays
eagerness to seek safety at the village

  find th pup an foller me joey he
directed ill send some o th young
bucks down to meet ye ye wont be in
no danger but i must put a fightin
heart into white i-iar without a minute
lost or our goose is cooked swing a leg
over yer hoss an th minute ye find him
come a humpin

  why cant you wait a bit clay began
to expostulate but now sure of his man
murty swung into the saddle and raced
away

murty smiled grimly as he can-
tered along the disappearance of
his partner had been a matter
rather difficult for him to arrange to his
satisfaction it had been less easy than
the proposed victim had supposed ques-
tions would be asked when he returned to
the frontier without him there were
several old mountain men who were still
curious to learn just how another partner
of his up in the medicine bow mountains
had died now with the killing blamed on
the hostile dakota the finale would be as
simple as it was agreeable

  cussed if it aint playin right into my
hands he exulted no matter whether
th pawnees win or lose ill jump this place
with what furs i can take an cache th
rest then i can look up a new partner
an move down green river way where no
questions will be asked

  he entered the village and drew rein
before white hairs lodge tossing his
package of presents to the chiefs young
squaw he raised his bull-like voice in a
demand for the chief to appear priests
and warriors crowded thick about him and
he was astounded to learn white hair had
not returned

  he went to black buffalos lodge
black buffalo must have seen him there
said a priest

  he had been there he was gone when
i went back the second time i missed
him going and coming replied the puzzled
trader

  he went to get the little trader the
evening star is angry with her children
the skidi

  wild suspicions shot through murtys
mind clay had said nothing about any
invitation from the chief to come to the
village

  send some of your warriors to bring
the little trader here he was to follow
after me with another white man who
escaped from the immigrant train bring
them both and let the evening star be fed
then find the chief-

  a staccato shriek at his feet caused him
to jump and lurch half out the saddle
what he saw bereft him of reason for a
moment and he could only glare with his
mouth open and his eyes bulging the
squaw had opened the pack and was now
holding up a gay handkerchief to which was
pinned a fresh scalp the streak of gray-
ish-black identified it beyond all question
it was the focal point for every pair of
savage eyes in the savage circle

  gawdamighty white hars top-knot
clay done fr him an put his har in the
bundle to do fr me babbled the dazed
plotter

  the black buffalo sells us to the
dakotas shouted the priest

somethin cornin aint in-
juns barked the night guard of
the trappers camp on the smoky

  they were employees of the american
fur company and were making for st
louis the rival of montreal as an outfitting
center

  white mans voice decided one of the
trappers as the faint cry was repeated

  mebbe a game to git us off our guard
grunted another as he rolled aside and
the roughneck



nursed his rifle injuns thickern wild
mustard

  they listened a moment then the cry
came again from the darkness sounding
near at hand but very weak

  help-friends

  yeh friends to honest men come
into th light ordered the guard dropping
on one knee

  two men stumbled into the firelight
and one glance at their despairing haggard
faces told the mountain men they were no
renegade whites acting as decoys they
were made comfortable by the fire and
provided with food they ate ravenously
bowls falling asleep with a buffalo rib half
raised to his mouth

  clay produced a pipe and after tobacco
had been given him he wearily explained

  men that feller have been running
from injuns moren a month lost track
of time he swears its two months but
hes been loony at times we was following
the arkansas and was chased away from
it by some pawnees we got clear of them
but didnt dare beat back to the river
then our powder give out then our
hosses stampeded one night we threw
away our rifles and went it afoot we
didnt dare travel much in the daytime
during the last two weeks as the country

seemed full of injuns making for the
arkansas guess if we hadnt hit your
camp weda cashed in dead tired talk
more tomorrer

  th injuns ye see was dakota tryin
to round up little pawnee village in-
formed the guard they tried it four
weeks ago an got a awful drubbin seems
ol white hars people fed a white man
to one o their star gods th night afore th
battle an their medicine was so strong
they licked bout five times their number
what dakotas escaped hustled back home
an now theyve come back with some eight
hundred yeh arkansas is a good river
to keep shet of till th troubles over
atween th two tribes

  the firelight struck sparks from clays
pale eyes half-rising from the buffalo
robe he faintly murmured

  white man eh happen to hear his
name

  yeh an it didnt bring any sorrer
growled the trapper skunk had a post
down th river kilt his partner an mur-
dered ol white har th pawnee chief
name was murty one of our men hap-
pened along th day follerin th fight an
larned all bout it better go to sleep

                                 author of no brains

 the job was thrown at big cap-
tain john riley in the first
place-tossed like a bone to a
-  - dog by a fat-jowled pig-eyed
shipowner with the manners of a wart-
hog and the soul of a shark who prided
himself on being direct and businesslike

 you piled up a good tramp steamer
and youve been stranded ever since
pointed peter f slemm the shipowner
youre in bad with the underwriters
youll take any job you can get thats
why i hired you and paid you beforehand
youll work cheap

 humiliated to his toes but desperate
for work the other bowed his elderly head
and spoke in soft measured words that
trembled queerly

  that is thrue he admitted with the
suspicion of a brogue ive a sick wife
correct agreed slemm rolling a
luscious cigar between thick lips now
then youll get a cheap crew and cheap
grub and just enough to get to vladivostok
at that the ship aint much-shes forty
years old dug out of the boneyard and
fixed up as a three-masted schooner-but
she came cheap thats the main thing

  this is a business venture you see
strictly business slemm condescended to
explain further if you get across ill
make something and maybe youll get
another chance if she blows up on the
way-im speakin frank-itll cost as little
as possible the cargo of explosives is
consigned to the export transportation
department of the roosian government
ill fix the business end youll only have

to work the ship thats fall i guess

  all right murmured riley huskily
as his big fists clenched ill take the
chance

  slemm did not offer to shake hands and
riley was glad of it for the trim gray-eyed
mustached mariner with the ramrod spine
longed to choke the cold-eyed owner and
scatter his fat carcass about the room
only the subsequent unemployment de-
terred hun-and he had tramped the streets
till his heart was sick within him

  oh a jewel of an owner riley mut-
tered bitterly as he strode toward the san
francisco waterfront a grand fine
shpecimen of a cold-blooded swine and
me once captain of a ten-thousand-ton
freighter oh well-mebbe ill meet
friends on the east coast its a gamblers
chance but im a gambler i have to be

  had the sailor known how an ironic
fate was shuffling cards against him he
might not have gambled at all desperate
as he was but like other humans he could
not peer into the future thus he found
himself a week later on the poop of a big
three-masted fore and after as she
pointed toward the horizon of the pacific
and rolled her soggy old nose into the while-
capped seas leaving the sentinel golden
gate behind her

  the ship gave rileys sailor-heart a
twinge when first he set foot on her for
cheap she was the hull was the worst
of the old hulks resurrected from oakland
estuary the graveyard of the pacific
the canvas rigging and sticks were patch-
work collected from everywhere the


on short allowance



interior furnishings were meager and old
there were no topsails topsails cost
money only the cargo was valuable and
that consisted of dynamite and gun-
powder packed in waterproof cases and
kegs in the hold till the old ship staggered
under its lethal load

  somehow riley collected a crew good
men were afloat in better ships and to get
a total of ten souls aboard the desperate
master had to take anything that walked
trusting to make the riffraff into sailors
later his last recruit was his prize it
came on a wharf where he was cursing his
schooner and whined for a job at sea

  gimme a chance pleaded the cringing
derelict jest a show to git away from
waterfront booze i wont be in the way-
gimme a chancel

  clad in a sweaty gingham shirt and faded
blue overalls the man was short stocky
snub-nosed blear-eyed and red-faced a
veteran alcoholic showing long allegiance
to john barleycorn he looked too worth-
less even for that ship but he persisted

  waldng to semi-consciousness in a quiet
gutter an hour before he had reviewed his
past life hazily felt deeply and senti-
mentally regretful and resolved on a last
effort to put himself out of temptation
thus he sought the sea where liquor is not
supposed to be

  when dynamite was mentioned the man
ignored it-or never heard it-and still
persisted the framework of his body
seemed fairly sound and his eyes held a
blurred sort of intelligence so riley signed
him on and hoped for the best the man
called himself whisky bill and was
shunted into the forecastle into the com-
pany of men scarce better than he

  before this riley had signed on a tall
dark-haired silent nondescript with the
sky-blue eyes found in visionaries con-
querors and fanatics and a part of a little
finger gone he acquired the name of
big frank the mans face and bearing
seemed dull and listless even mournful
but riley began to note otherwise on the
second day out when it was brought home
to him forcibly

  the crew kicks about the grub already
warned first mate blazon a swarthy lazy
product of the florida keys watch that
big frank he leads them

  on the shtart of the voyage eh then
well have to shtop it said riley quietly

ill admit the grubs dog-rotten but ill

shtand no slack from that crowd i dont
dare they dont know their work ye
gods what a crew and the master shook

anguished fists in the air

  later in his bare cabin riley thought
things over he pitied these men and had
planned to be an easy master he was
born to be friends with humankind but
now he resolved to exact the strictest kind
of discipline the food was enough to make
any crew restive there must be no slack
master on top of that

  furthermore the ship might be filthy
but riley would not be he understood
the influence of a spruce clean-looking
officer so the vessel saw him thereafter
in his old natty masters uniform with only
the insignia of his former line taken off
on that slattern schooner the trim mer-
chant-marine skipper seemed incongruous
but he had himself to please

  riley had no doubts about the loyalty
of the easy-going blazon or his second-mate
a swede named larsen but he saw they
had to toe the mark also otherwise the
master would have to impose his discipline
single-handed fie resolved to give them
an object lesson at the first opportunity
and thus on the fifth day when a scowling
greek at the mainmast obeyed the first
mates orders sluggishly riley was pre-
pared he leaped off the poop and grabbed
the man by the back of the neck while
noting that two other members of the crew
were watching

  what dye mean by that he bawled
when you get an ordher youll jumpl
and he shook the other till his teeth
chattered now continued the wrath-
ful master youll have a little dhrill
you see that cordage coiled along the deck
youll coil and uncoil it for one hour if
you loaf one minute youll get two hours
more now shtart

  from the corner of his eye riley noted
a giant form loafing almost behind turn and
whirled about suddenly it was big frank

  well snapped the master stiffening

  the other looked embarrassed and riley
pointed toward the forecastle

  go forward you he roared

  the other hesitated a fraction of a
second but at the first twitch of the peppery
masters muscles he shuffled toward the
forecastle and riley mounted the poop
again the mate had quietly taken in the
io

adventure

scene and smiled at him but riley was not
in that mood

  mishter blazong said the master
pointedly the next time youre not
obeyed inshtantly take action

  i was goin to start protested the
mate but you went too fast

  dont let any one beat you snapped
riley weve got to choke off throuble
before it shtarts with this crowd if there
was a man among em id praise the saints
but theyre too cheap that big frank is
the only one with muscles and if he shtarts
anything get him quick thems ordhers
without further words riley went to his
dingy cabin thinking of the sordid owner
who sent this foul old hulk to sea without
pity for those aboard and wishing he had
choked the fat scoundrel when he had the
chance sitting down to his tasteless meal
of suspicious canned beef and ancient
potatoes and brackish bread riley longed
for the choking still more back in his
consciousness he wondered what he would
do after he turned liis cargo over to the
russians another trip on a slemm ship
was unthinkable

but the next four weeks went by
quietly with the crew sullen but
outwardly falling in with rileys
taut discipline and the old dynamite-
schooner slatting and groaning westward
and northward across the seas rolling the
miles behind her then came a storm
mistrusting his ship riley stood by his
helmsman and was drenched and battered
for hours by whipping spindrift while
snarling seas leaped over the low bulwarks
and swept the deck a hundred times when
the storm subsided forty hours after it
started and the wind swung from the
north in a steady blow the tired master
turned into his bunk and let the big
regular waves rock him to sleep

  riley awoke suddenly in his dark bunk
a yell and the sounds of rushing feet on
the deck apprized him that something was
amiss jumping out of his bunk and
donning trousers riley sensed it was
early morning-before dawn

  the agitated clatter of feet outside
increased voices shouted frantically on
the poop above riley something heavy was
being hauled along the deck to port it
sounded like a boat being swung from her
davits a sharp voice boomed from above

then footsteps thundered down the cabin
companionway while the half-clad riley
grabbed a pistol from a holster and waited
till a near-by voice howled to him

  jump for your life shrieked the voice
it belonged to blazon the mate the
ship is afire forward

  the mans sea-boots clattered upward
again desperately

  rileys heart clutched and his hair
tingled at the instant of imagination that
pictured what would happen when the first
spark struck that cargo panic seized him
but only for a moment the next instant
he rushed to the deck pistol in hand

  forward a tiny glare showed through
the glass of the closed hatch above the
forecastle-a sinister flicker of light just
bright enough to throw the panting
shrieking men into shadow as they surged
about the poop and labored madly to cast
overside the bulky small boat the mate
was directing savagely with fists and curses
the quivering second mate was working
at the stubborn falls the prow of the
small boat was swung outward almost
meeting the heavy seas that leaped toward
the deck and near that prow spoke a
whimpering voice chattering with terror
and repealing its phrase automatically-

  he turned the lamp over-he turned the
lamp over

  rileys eye took in the scene in an instant
he glanced toward the wheel where the
helmsman had left to join in the general
panic then riley glanced forward the
yellow-red light seemed a little larger
and dynamite only a few inches away

  the cool dawn-wind was soughing through
the rigging laying the ship far over to
port and whistling about the hatch above
the forecastle where only a flimsy floor
stood between the flames and the cargo
above the stars were beginning to pale
far to the north but within easy small-
boat distance stretched the many islands
of the aleutian group like stepping-stones
from alaska to the orient alongside the
old schooner the sea was running high and
the vessel was quartering the giant waves
and just beginning to broach as it felt the
lack of the helmsmans hands

  in the flash that the practised eye of
riley noted all these things his mind was
made up he raised the pistol and strode
toward the mob firing into the air the
report half-paralyzed some of them
on short allowance



  off from that boat roared riley
get away

  for an instant the men hesitated and the
master leveled the pistol toward the mass

  go forward somebody he roared
get forward and open that hatch-quick
the man near the small boats prow
backed away from it and seemed undecided
but another man claimed the masters
attention

  no shrieked larsen the cowering
second mate are you mad it iss
murder no

  in the faint glow of the dawn the mans
face was grimacing and his voice whinnied
with fear but riley could not hesitate
he knew that each second a spark was
nearing the slumbering inferno in the
hold

  go forward he thundered and a gust
of wind took the full force of his voice into
the crowd go forward some of you
quick-before i kill you all

  instantly larsen jumped backward and
overboard equally quick the desperate
master fired but the bullet missed its mark
then big frank started frantically to ward
off the master but riley ignored him
something else had happened

 in that maddening second a chunky
figure had rushed away from the small
boats prow and off the poop while riley
sprang to the wheel the figure dashed
wildly across the deck one leap and the
man was up the forward steps another
brought him to the forecastle hatch a
quick tug and it came off and the heavy
north wind sucked down the open hole and
blew tiny sparks and wisps of smoke upward
and outward

 good work whisky bill-climb the
rigging shrieked riley as he twisted the
spokes of the wheel like a madman and the
other understood somehow and went up
the shrouds like a panic-stricken monkey
while riley swung the heavy ship around

  ignoring the maniacs by the small boat
with his heart in his mouth wondering
if his next moment would be in eternity
riley pointed his ship straight into the wind
with the lift of a giant wave the bow arose
till the deck tilted high and the old schooner
groaned with the extra strain then the
big wave swirled under the stern and the
bow lowered till riley felt as if on top of a
steep hill the next comber loomed in
front of him like a dark high wall

  hold on every one roared the master
hold for your lives

  the bowsprit dived straight into the
foaming seething wall of water that
crashed onward till it struck the edge of
the hatchway then vats and firkins and
tons of brine swept into the hold and the
lethal light snuffed out

  the big wave swirled aft in foaming
frenzy it slapped the mainmast with
mighty force it struck the break of the
poop and climbed up up till the feet and
knees and thighs of the master were under
cold water and he held to the wheel fran-
tically while the slavering mass of brine
and foam tried to suck him away from it
the small boat disappeared unseen then
gradually the heavy mass of water grew
lower about the skippers legs and the
awful pressure lessened the ships bow
and stern came up heavily and then the
old craft groaned and slumped down-
waterlogged

  that breathed the half-naked riley
as he began to swing the logy ship to port
and let the wind again catch the slatting
sails that is the way to put out a fire

five days and nights the pumps
were working till the porous-hided
old tub slowly came up out of the
water three men were gone-vanished
with the small boat or overboard-but
riley made up for that by peeling off his
natty brass-buttoned coat and pi telling
in himself setting an example to the hard-
driven crew the skipper watched that
crew closely ready for the first hostile
move but there was none perhaps his
set face forestalled it as he thought over
his situation thankful only that the cargo
was waterproof and hardly damaged he
said little but worked and waited until the
ship was right again

  on the sixth day all hands rested and
on the next refreshed and invigorated
blessed by a fresh wind that shoved the
old craft joyously along riley went on
deck prepared to thresh out certain ques-
tions relieving the mate he ordered both
watches on deck and soon they grouped
under the poop looking curious or em-
barrassed as the case might be then
with only five of his former crew before
him and with the mate sleeping below the
skipper began his formal court martial

  you he began pointing a forefinger
io

adventure

at whisky bill you said he tipped the
lamp over who did

  weak and wobbly front his alcohol-cure
and his recent labor bill was taken aback
blank-faced he tried to think while his
eyes swung toward the threatening face of
big frank and then away riley noticed
the glance while bill sparred for time

  who me he asked scratching his
head

  you said the master grimly

  did-did i say that

  you did replied riley his temper
rising tell me who tipped that lamp
lie thundered was it this man frank
quick now-shpeak up

  m-mebbe said bill nervously i
dunno i didnt see him

  and a focsle lamp hangin on heavy
chains was tipped over accidental said
riley sarcastically lets see who filed
the chains you frank shtep forward
there was a ring of something dangerous
in the irish captains voice and the sullen
sailor felt impelled to step forward while
riley half-descended the steps and smiled
at him peculiarly

  and why didnt ye jump into the
small boat with the others when the big
wave hit us asked riley softly the
boat was provisioned for a long cruise
wasnt it that was part of the big idea
wasnt it youd tip over the lamp and
then every one would have a fine excuse
to jump into the shmall boat and ride to the
aleutians them that wasnt in on the
plan would be frightened enough to go
into the boat anyhow it was a fine
genteel beautiful idea-but why didnt ye
go into the boat did ye fear thered be a
hitch

  the big mans eyes looked at the deck
and he said nothing

  well snapped riley shpeak up
what about it the second mate was
frightened enough to leave why didnt
you are ye too brave or- and his
voice was smooth as ice and deadly as
poison-did ye notice i was watchin ye
there was still no answer from big frank
and the rest of the crew watched him
some anxiously some in amazement the
amazed ones included only the cook and
whisky bill and rileys heart sank at what
he had to depend on-one lazy mate one
fat cook and one half-convalescent drunk-
ard but the thought only made the

master set his jaws harder come what
might big frank had to be punished

  jumping from the steps like a cat riley
smashed a fist straight into big franks
eye and followed it up with the other fist

  youll lead the crew to desert will ye
snarled riley youll blow the ship
because ye dont like the grub eh all
right you yellow sneak-try this

  the big sailor tried to spar off the blows
but the master was too eager and the mighty
fists crashed through his guard big frank
came to with a man slushing his face with a
bucket of water and the master standing
over his prone body

  youre awake are ye bellowed the
skipper noting that the rest of the men
were very quiet all right-get up
the wobbly sailor was helped to his feet

  now ruled the master youre due for
chains but im short-handed youll help
work the ship and at night youll be locked
in the afther lazaret ill take some o that
swagger out o you or ill kill ye here-
afther ill go armed the first wrong move
you make will be your last undershtand
yes then go help the cook

  thus passed the first big episode of the
trip across thereafter the ship bowled
along with riley watchful the mate
cautious the crew subdued and whisky
bill beginning to show tan in place of the
purple-red that once made his face livid
watching the mans awkward attempts at
sailor-work despite his awful physical
reaction and noting that he never com-
plained rileys heart warmed toward the
derelict though he avoided the slightest
appearance of favoritism and drove the
man with the rest gradually bills stag-
nant brain cleared the half-paralyzed
muscles whipped into shape and he ate
better slept better kept his sea-legs better
riley was getting proud of his liquor-cure

  whisky bills gratitude came on a sultry
midnight weeks later when the skipper was
sleeping in his bunk in the cabin the
mates bunk was opposite his but the mate
was on duty there were no partitioned
rooms for the officers it saved space for
more cargo

  the cabin door opened stealthily and a
tiny shaft of the lighter gloom outside
pierced the black darkness within not a
sound was heard yet riley sensed the thing
and awoke with a start noting the streak
of light he grasped the handle of a pistol
on short allowance



under his pillow and lay ready for action

  the doorway widened until more than a
foot of haze showed and a dark object
crossed the threshold then the door
began closing softly that was the mo-
ment riley was waiting for sitting up-
right he had that form exactly covered with
the pistol and his nerves were never icier

hands up he snarled quick
all right sir came a soft voice
in reply wait till i close the door
the voice was whisky bills and riley
grunted and pointed the pistol-muzzle
downward wondering what would come
next the door closed softly and foot-
steps pattered across the floor to the bunk

 well snapped riley what does
this mean

  i couldnt come any sooner apologized
bill im on duty and the rest is sort o
watchin me you see theyre goin d
blow up the ship

  at this calm announcement riley felt his
muscles tingle and his scalp itch

 again how who when he
rasped

  in them straits near japan i forgot
the name

  sangar the japs call it tsugaru
said riley well pass through to make
the japan sea thatll be about two
weeks from now how will this blow-up
business be done

  like last time therell be a fire an
everybodyll rush fer the boats only this
time there aint goin to be no heavy sea to
put the fire out the ships goin to blow
fer keeps

  um yes said riley sarcastically
and whatll i be doin while all this is
goin on-playin solitaire

  no youll go natural to the fire and
see what can be done thats what youd
do aint it well while youre lookin at
things the restll skip

  riley was thinking hard

  and how do you know all this he
asked

  me oh im one of them

  the statement was so cool and casual
that it made rileys brain buzz one
of them he echoed wondering whether
to hug this man or shoot him for safety

  sure i had to or else-blooey fer me
if i didnt stand in id be suspicioned so
i stood in-see im now the worst little

grouch in the crew exceptin big frank
i see murmured the skipper slowly
and is the whole crowd in on the plot
the whole gang-big frank an looie
the greek an changes the sloavk an me
all but the cook every ones sick o
weevil biscuits an four-year-old spuds an

condemn corn beef an-

  enough groaned the skipper irritably
im sick of it too but why should the
crew want to jump ship when were almost
across

  because its a grudge now sir the
other time they wanted to git away because
o the grub but the way you handled em
made em sore an big franks been jawin
an grouchin an stewin till theyre all
worked up and-the grubs still with
us

  i see murmured the thoughtful master
fingering the pistol carefully and was
the second mate-and the two other men
that left us-in on the first plot
naw replied bill they was plain
scared like they was expected to be
there was a long silence from the skip-
pers bunk for riley was thinking hard
thrust by fate into this worthless and dan-
gerous command and in trouble through
no direct fault of his own he was appalled
at the relentlessness of the men he had
counted in san francisco to make into
sailors and yet through his thoughts ran
a constant wonder at this half-cured
derelict whisky bill the man owed him
nothing except a job and that was the
poorest on the seven seas

  tell me said riley suddenly why
did ye come to warn me

  there was another long silence before
the mans uncertain voice answered
youre a white guy the rest of ems
tramps youre the only guy on the ship
that shaves an looks like somethin human
im an american

  although at first the skipper groped
he understood upon reflection it was the
call of caste and self-respect to a man
climbing up

  i see said riley putting bare feet on
the dark floor and i see i can thrust ye
but and his voice was speculative how
good could ye be in a pinch

  i dunno sir admitted bill soberly
sometimes me heart acts wrong but
mebbe i can be some good im billy
kenyon
no

adventure

  and whose he

  i stood off joe gans fer ten rounds
once came the reply not without pride
an then the booze come along thats
all sir

  i undershtand murmured riley with
pity in his voice but mebbe itll not
come to a fight ive another plan you
say youre one with the gang forward do
they thrust ye

  almost not quite

   tis well now listen barrin head
winds we reach sangar shtraits in just
under two weeks pray therell be no
throuble before then or well be up in the
air in more ways than one but youve
got near two weeks to prove yourself a
majestic conshpirator undershtand youll
be one of them-most valiant in cursin ship
an skipper then when the time draws
nigh youll volunteer to fire the ship while
the rest of the rats scuttle toward the whale-
boat on the poop

  riley heard his companion gurgle and
wriggle but proceeded calmly

  youll get the job theyll be lookin
for a sucker an mebbe theyll be glad to be
rid of ye now listen the fire will begin
in the focsle for thats the only place to
give every one time to run for the starbd
whaleboat while the flames are eatin
through the forward deck plankin if
the fire was tossed into the cargo hatch-
way- thered be no whaleboat now
when ye get the word youll see theres
much shmoke and little fire forward with
a bucket o water to put it out then
your job is done-unless somethin goes
wrong

  bill cogitated over this for some time
while from outside came the faint voice of
the mate shouting an order to his watch
riley was first to note it

  go before youre missed he said
better not take the door go up the
companionway mebbe the helmsmans
asleep and remembher what i told ye
ill not forget your coming here this night
now go

  obeying noiselessly bill groped his way
upward till the faint sound of a hatch lifting
and closing apprized the skipper that the
man had gained the poop then captain
john riley his mind at ease because he
knew what was ahead and when it would
come sank into his bunk and slept the
sleep of a man without care

twelve peaceful days followed
blessed by gracious winds that
made the old schooner heel over
skittishly like a sinful old crone dancing in
her second childhood riley cracked on
all sail and longed for topsails but even
as she was the old tub slapped her blunt
bows in the lively waves and lumbered along
with a foaming wake that gladdened the
skippers heart true the short-handed
crew had to work the pumps a bit every
day and the awful provender kept con-
tinuous nausea aboard but the master felt
that the worst was over and he waited for
the anticipated climax calmly

  it came on the hazy morning of the
thirteenth day when the old schooner was
loafing her way into sangar strait fifty
miles northward beyond the vague curtain
of haze that hid volcano bay lay the island
of yezo seventy miles straight ahead was
hakodate and forty miles southeast was
cape shiriya northern rampart of hondo
the mainland of japan between the in-
visible landmarks stretched the gray-blue
sheet of water clear to the western horizon
where a faint patch of dark smoke hung
low in the heavy air the old schooners
booms were slatting to port and starboard
sparring for puffs of wind and the three
jibs dawdled limply from the foremast
the ship was making bare steerage-way

  at ten oclock riley took his sight at
the blurred sun and established position
while blazon napped below big frank
lounged in the waist of the ship and the
slovak smoked lazily at the wheel whisky
bill and the greek were supposed to be
sleeping in the forecastle

  suddenly yelling at the top of his voice
the greek burst out of the forecastle door
with a faint wisp of smoke following his
shoulders big frank jumped toward him
and riley at the poop lowered his sextant
and knew the moment had come his
pistol was in his pocket but he kept it there

  fire yelled the greek breaking for
the steps to the poop fire forward
fire

  at the first shout big frank joined him
and started aft also yelling the speed
in their actions showed that quick develop-
ments were expected and out of the tail
of his eye riley noted that the falls of the
whaleboat were arranged for a quick
launching of the craft he knew the men
would jump up the starboard steps and
on short allowance

hi

rush for that boat and they did and the
helmsman joined them while from the dark
space beyond the forecastle doorway poured
a denser column of smoke

  riley sought the port steps and rushed
for the deck once there he ignored the
excited group at the whaleboat and hurtled
toward the forecastle where the smoke
became denser as he reached the door
another figure came out running head
down

  halt yelled riley

  whisky bill looked up saw the master
and stopped

  is the fire out snapped riley

  mostly said bill grinning what
comes next sir

  youll shtop laughin before them
thraitors on the poop see ye commanded
the irascible skipper laying a heavy hand
on his shoulder youre bein forced into
the flamin ruins by an overbearin and
heartless tyrant so theyll not wait for ye

  he heaved bill into the smoky forecastle
and tumbled in himself closing the door

  the light from the blurred hatch above
disclosed a strange sight to the coughing
skipper on the aisle between two rows
of aged and smelly bunks stripped of their
cheap blankets and quilts lay a pile of half-
blackened smoldering wet cloth and papers
leading to an oil can half-full of liquid ten
feet away arising from the floor whisky
bill started to tip the contents of the can
on the smoking embers riley jumped
and grasped his hand wrathfully

  dhrop that he roared are ye
crazy

  awright obeyed bill only its
water

  water

  sure thats my idea sir i told the
others wed better light the rags an run
a slow trail to the oil-can so shed explode
sure inside of a minute then the fired
be too big fer you to control when you got
here see they said i was one bright
guy so i poured the oil out o the can an
slipped water in then i stuck some oil
around under the bunks to make it smell
right see

  the revelation floored riley

  by all the saints he exclaimed slump-
ing against a bunk id never think it
was in ye youre a jewel me lad-a
jewel and he slapped the mans back
affectionately

  footsteps pattered on the deck outside
and a hand fumbled at the door-latch and
the two men straightened suddenly the
door opened and the round face of journet

the cook peered in owlishly

  i theenk i hear noise he explained
when he saw who was inside some men
they leave very fast in a boat sir what

is it

  its throuble said riley the crews
deserted here- and he handed the
astonished cook the pistol-take this and
see that no one comes aboard

  then riley turned to bill

  now that theyve gone well go out-
side he said go you into the cabin
wake blazong and bring up all the arms
you can get then go aft and wait orders
let no one come aboard undershtand

  bill nodded and accompanied riley on
deck while the bewildered cook stood and
fingered the unaccustomed pistol specu-
latively without a glance at the whale-
boat being rowed frantically a quarter-mile
away riley climled to the deserted poop
and took the wheel slowly swinging the
dynamite-ship back into her old course
and then looking past the three big masts
and the jibs rileys eyes widened

  coming on with a bone in her teeth and
a trail of black smoke pouring backward
from thick stacks was a narrow-beamed
gray warship she was still far away but
riley saw she was headed in his direction
and wondered if she had noticed the de-
sertion of his crew but just then as bill
and the sleepy blazon came up the com-
panionway and joined the skipper a puff
of wind whipped the waters toward the
schooner and caught the sails making the
old ship heel with renewed life

  thats what i wanted muttered riley
as he spun the spokes of the wheel now
well show them scoundhrels a little
dishipline

     obeying rileys hand the
schooner swung to port and began
vjifw tq overtake e laboring whaleboat
inch by inch foot by foot yard by yard
she gained on the astonished rowers until
the long bowsprit towered above them
and the big bows threatened to grind them
under then while the alarmed men in
the boat were standing up and yelling
and their oars began to slip out of the
tholes the master swung the schooner to


adventure

starboard passing them on the broadside
but keeping a few yards away

  toss out a line roared riley to blazon
and bill and they hurled a slim rope
toward the whaleboat as the big ship
lumbered by the greek in the bow of
the smaller boat looked at big frank in
the stern frank nodded and the greek
made fast while bill twisted the other end
of the line about a bitt by the stern of the
schooner as the rope tightened it whipped
the smaller craft under the stern of the
dynamite-ship

  that was the moment riley had been
waiting for

  now ye sneakin scum ive got ye
where i want ye-you threacherous
hounds he roared leaving the wheel and
shaking a fist over the stern youll shtick
in that boat and do penance across the whole
japan sea and then youll face a court-
you greasy swine one wrong move and
ill hang you all the first man that
thries to come aboard here will be shot
and if any of ye thries to cut the boat
adlirift-gawd help ye undershtand

  in the stern of the whaleboat big franks
right arm reached backward then the
skippers eye grew cold and he pointed an
automatic carefully while blazon and bill
stood ready to back him up big franks
arm came half-forward with a big blue
revolver with a shriek the slovak rushed
upon him and grabbed at his wrist

  faced at last with deliberate mutiny-
for a man in the crew had brought forth
a pistol against the master-rileys gray
eyes betrayed a flame that meant death for
somebody and yet his voice was soft

  throw that gun overboard he purred
or ill finish the whole boatload of ye
right now

  there was an instant of inaction the
upturned face of big frank was livid with
rage but his wrist was frantically held by
the terror-stricken slovak while the greek
cowered in the bow then sullenly big
frank released his fingers from the pistol
and it dropped into the foanjing wake of the
pitching tossing whaleboat

   tis well riley nodded to his com-
panions and now well take turns at
guardin the shtern while the others work
ship its short-handed we are-and gawd
help us if theres a blow-but praise be
were rid o them mutineers at last hello-
whats this

  looking forward the trio perceived the
gray cruiser nearing them off the starboard
bow with her clipper-prow slicing the
waves and her yards whipping backward
in the wind she created from her taff-
rail snapped a red sun-flag with numerous
rays-the ensign of the japanese navy
even as the three men watched her several
colored flags broke from the halyards over
her high bridge

  thatll be a jap patrol-ship said riley
his eyes feasting on the trim lines of the big
cruiser with its guns peeping from case-
ments along the main deck hello-
theres signals international code they
want us to shtop all right shtop it is
and he spun the wheel hard over

  the dynamite-ship swung into the wind
to starboard and the cruiser drew up until
the schooners men could see the blue-clad
japs lounging about its decks then the
warship forged by and stopped her wash
making the whaleboat bob up and down in
the water like mad

  five minutes later a dark-skinned sub-
lieutenant scrambled aboard the sailing-
ship from a launch followed by six natty
little armed sailors with the dignity
befitting the master of a better ship the
trim riley descended from the poop to
bow his visitors aboard and the japanese
lieutenant returned the bow coming to the
point without further parley

  i regret arrest this boat said the
officer bowing again in apology unutterable

  the blow took riley aback

  arresht he exclaimed what for

  the officer shrugged his shoulders and
pointed over the bulwark toward the
cruiser

  captain itsibuki talk eenglees he
suggested you go now

  though polite the request was so terse
and full of meaning that the baffled riley
wondered what his crime was his mind
reverted to the happenings of the trip but he
found no clue resistance was impossible
and unjustified though so riley deter-
mined to see this japanese navy captain
and have it out

  all right he sighed im ready as
soon as i get my papers and by the way-
theres some men undher the shtern that
need lookin after he pointed aft
watch em while im gone they bad
boys you savvy

  the japanese bowed and grinned
on short allowance



   savvy savvy  he rep ied  i wa tch um

  this done riley collected his papers and
started with whisky bill as companion
in the launch for the warship the mate
staying with the schooner all the way
across the master tried to conjecture what
it was all about and he kept wondering
until ushered into the sacred quarters of
the grizzled mustached japanese captain
then riley stood literally on the carpet
scenting the faint odor that permeates
every oriental habitation while the navy
man lolled in a swivel chair behind a fine
roll-top desk to the rear of riley stood
whisky bill and two japanese orderlies

  you are captain riley tolled off the
navy man in precise english you com-
mand the experiment schooner owned by
peter f slemm of san francisco you
left that port april second with dynamite
and gunpowder for the export transporta-
tion department of russia is that cor-
rect

  yes said riley what about it

  ah said the officer shrewdly we
shall see you worked for mister slemm
long

  this is my-first trip undher him and my
lasht

  the officers slightly slanted eyes looked
more interested

  what is that he asked softly

  the ship the grub the men and the
owner said riley im a sailor not a dog

  and then with tongue loosened at last
and his outraged temper up riley burst
forth into vituperation of slemm that
would have made that persons hair curl
while the officer smiled orientally riley
did not know what had taken him under
the eyes of a world power he only felt
himself a catspaw in some game that was
beyond his ken played by a fat wolf of an
owner without morals or scruples and the
skipper wanted to keep clear of its after-
math from the man before him riley
expected neither sympathy nor enmity it
was a naval officer on duty

  go on said the officer offering a seat
when riley had finished tell me about
your voyage across i think something
must have happened

  seeing he should tell the truth soberly

and without trimmings riley started at

the beginning and recited the whole story

at times he saw a peculiar light flashing

in the brown eyes of the japanese officer



but the latter said nothing until riley
was through then the navy man picked
some papers out of a pigeonhole and faced
the merchant skipper again adjusting
spectacles judicially

  you are sure the food caused all the
trouble asked the officer peering over the
spectacles and smiling

  why of course replied riley dis-
gruntled because his story was questioned
what else wasnt the grub rotten bad
if ye think different try it

  and your cargo was for russia per-
sisted the officer

  certainly said the irritated riley
dont ye believe it

  yes nodded the officer politely and
this man-big frank-tried to bum your
ship two times because of the food

csrjj the oriental officers faint smile
was bland but riley sensed the
 undercurrent and scratched his head
thoughtfully

  well what else can it be he hazarded
i do not know i am not sure there
was an agent who did certain evil work
for a hostile foreign power and he left san
francisco very secret in the first part of
april while american officers were looking
for him very hard it may not surprise
you but america is now at war with the
nation he worked for when you left port
it was not but even then the american
laws were very badly broken by this man
they thought he left on some ship but
they never found him

  now suppose and the eyes of the
japanese were thoughtful suppose this
man got on a schooner and then found
it was dynamite and gunpowder for russia
our ally would an agent for a hostile
foreign power want the cargo to reach
russia i think not i think he would
use any means to prevent it and suppose
the food was not good and gave excuse for
making trouble suppose he thought him-
self able to destroy your ship and get away
safely in a small boat

  with eyes opening riley caught sight of
dangers that might have engulfed him and
was staggered

  wow he gulped i wondher if its

thrue if it is-

  wait said the officer i can describe
this agent he has been looked for every-
where was he tall and with curly hair
u

adventure

and very blue eyes and a blunt nose was
he stooped somewhat in the shoulders
did he have a little linger only half as long
as it should be

  he did breathed the sober riley
its gawds truth thatll be big frank
to a hair and whisky bill echoed him

  the japanese officer allowed himself
another cryptic smile and without com-
ment opened a roll of paper and began
reading slowly translating oriental char-
acters into english as he went along the
subject was foreign to all that had gone
before and as the others listened they won-
dered what it was all about

  michael onstorff traitor to russia
murmured the reading officer born in
the baltic provinces and educated at
dantzig held positions in diplomatic
service until  when he went into what
you call the department of the interior
of russia in  he traveled in afghan-
istan and india in  he received high
position in the siberian service after that
certain shipments of explosives went in
secret from vladivostok to men very busy
with plots of enemies of the allies in british
colonies especially india michael on-
storff was caught at it and shot at vlad-
ivostok by the russian garrison on may
fourth while you were at sea and the
officer closed the paper with a snap

  gee exclaimed whisky bill while
riley scratched his head and wondered how
to figure it all out

  onstorff continued the imperturbable
japanese officer was the export trans-
portation department of the russian gov-
ernment there never was such a depart-
ment it was-what you call-a graft
on the side it sent out munitions to be
used by the enemies of england russia
japan and the allies

  rileys face lit with new vision as he
began to understand the real mission of
his ship but turning it over in his mind
he found one question would not down

  and peter f slemm the golden-
hearted shipowner-how about him

  i can not tell admitted the japanese
maybe he thought he was very shrewd
making big profit from the russians
maybe he did not know the truth very
few did

  then shouted riley excitedly big
frank didnt know it and double-crossed
his own people by trying to smash the ship

theyd paid for-the people whod gain by
receivin the cargo lord what a mix-up
he didnt know who the cargo was for
its the joke of the year-he didnt know it
he could not have known or else he
would have been the most obedient man
on your ship said the officer soberly
and now he added rising i have the
great regret to keep you under arrest until
the courts decide your case we will take
your schooner into hakodate for examina-
tion for yourself the arrest is only for a
time until the courts make a ruling i
fear no bad results for you for your story
seems to fit in every way and after the
way you saved your cargo the russian and
japanese governments owe you a very- deep
debt the officer bowed gracefully

  right murmured riley returning the
bow and preparing to leave and mebbe
some time ill command a real ship thats
not run so cheap

  the officers eyes met riley and the
officer understood

  there are five big full-riggers to be
delivered to english owners by the kobe
shipyards within a month and trained
masters are hard to find these days he
said bowing again i would be much
pleased to use my not small influence to
get you to command one

  that ended the interview and lightened
rileys heart till it sang within him for he
knew his work was not in vain thus he
went with his satellite up to the spotless
quarter-deck of the cruiser and lounged by
the breech of the big stern gun watching
a group of figures being shunted into a navy
launch from a slattern schooner near-by
one of the figures had its wrists bound and
squirmed in resistance but it hurtled into
the launch just the same

  that murmured riley judicially is
a result of cheapness-the cheapness of a
money-grubbin human shark in the first
place cheap ship cheap food cheap men
and i drew big frank because of it re-
member this all your life me lad-little is
good that comes cheaply

  yeh challenged billy kenyon whisky
bill no longer how about me

  you and the masters face became
soft as he faced the man thats right
youre different ill train ye for a mates
papers little is good that comes cheap-
but sometimes theres a pearl in the gullet
of a swine

the first part of the story quickly retold in story form

pate pulls the strings of human destinies and
the puppets at the ends of them move in ignor-
ance of the force they are elected to serve

  such a victim was james perry jr of norfolk
virginia convalescing from pneumonia he sailed
south and landed at cortina the seat of government
of zanhoria central america the early part of april

  by a darkened bedroom window in her home in
the calle dolores winifred brewer stood look-
ing out across the public park it was eleven
oclock the hour of retiring a mans white-flan-
neled figure loomed in the rays of a street lamp
as he passed a poinsettia thicket a hand shot out
the man fell hands dragged the body swiftly
into the bushes

  screaming the girl ran downstairs and out into
the street she did not stop for her father who
alarmed at her outcry had appeared in the hall
below in the street winifred ran into enrique
segovia together they searched the park and
found jimmy perry prone under some bushes
perrys head was bleeding from the blow he had
been robbed

  in walter brewers home jimmys wound was
treated he introduced himself to his host and
rescuers leaving the house enrique asked
jimmy if the latter remembered reading of a wil-
liam bowman a richmond real-estate dealer who
had absconded recently with a quarter of a
million dollars jimmy did

  apprehended by the police juan lopez jimmys
assailant disclosed information that lead officials
to believe the germans were trying to cause trouble
between zanhoria and the united states jimmy
and enrique planned with the aid of officials to
checkmate the conspiracy

  intent on calling on miss brewer jimmy was told
she and her father had deserted the house in the
calle dolores

at the banco nacional jimmy and enrique
conversed with senor morales the bank presi-
dent and were introduceed to miss mary taylor a

traveler and author miss taylor was the guest
of senor and dona morales having just arrived
from guatemala

  mopping the perspiration from his face sefior
morales flipped from his pocket a card bearing the
letters d-viii-k jimmy picked it up and
returned it to the banker

  from the bank jimmy went to the american
legation to call on the hon john henry lane
united states minister to zanhoria

  closeted with the minister jimmy asked him to
send in the official code to washington a letter to his
father mr lane granted the request jimmy ex-
plained what he had learned about the german
conspiracy

  in the street again jimmy saw winifred brewer
drive by in an automobile and stop at a pharmacy
he hastened to her and petitioned her and her
fathers assistance to foil the german plot she
pledged herself to the cause

  the brewers new home she told jimmy was at
the rafael fernandez hacienda on the santa marta
road

  shortly after president wilson made his speech
prior to the united states declaration of war on
germany jimmy enrique don luis valera secre-
tary of state and don emilio ortega state super-
intendent of police questioned lopez about what
he knew of the conspiracy

  lopez told of secret meetings of five mysterious
men at senor morales home from his descrip-
tion one of the conspirators was recognized as herr
adolph kaufman the german minister at this
juncture jimmy told of the card bearing the letters
d-viii-k

  ah said enrique it is simple d stands
for domingo sunday thus domingo-the
eighth-kaufman kaufman writes to morales
from arraca and sets a date for their meeting

  arraca was a german lumber camp on the rio
negro river

  zanhorias sympathies senor valera explained
were with the united states and the german




adventure

scheme was to overthrow president hurango of the
republic and place a german sympathizer at the
head of the government by this means kaufman
hoped to foment revolutions in central america
and thus divert a part of the united states forces
from her allies abroad

  the proposal to kidnap kaufman was then made
by jimmy he called on brewer to obtain the use
of the hacienda as a prison for the german minister

brewer consented while on the way to the haci-
enda jimmy met mary taylor who broached him
for a ride in his automobile he declined grace-
fully

  driving away from the brewer place jimmy
passed miss taylor out riding in senor morales
car she nodded to the american

  i lied to her and she caught me wailed jimmy
as he sped toward cortina

chapter ix

miss mary taylor passes

simmy returned the automobile
to the garage and walked back
to his hotel he was on the
point of entering when he heard
his name called he swung around and
saw enrique approaching

  i thought you were about due he said
as he came up hit it pretty close
didnt i

  youre a marvel jimmy told him
lets go to my room i need a tubbing
after that drive

  when they were behind the closed door
of the bedroom segovia put an eager
question-

  were you successful

  yes they will stand in with us tooth
and nail

  jimmy stepped into his bathroom and
turned on the water when he came back
he said

  ive got to do brewer justice enrique
he came to the scratch like a man con-
found it im sorry for him hes paying
an awful price for his liberty he
shows it

  did he suspect you

  i took good care that he didnt i
believe though miss brewer would be
glad to know that i knew its hard for
her to act a he the thing is eating her
heart out ill be with you in a minute
jimmy had slipped off his clothes while
he was speaking he went into his bath
and segovia lit a cigaret and waited he
took a newspaper from his pocket folded
it to a certain point and mused over a
short article his procedure had exposed
after a lusty splashing in his tub jimmy
came out

  i say old man he broke forth isnt
there another way to reach the santa
marta road than by the avenue alex-
ander

  yes only i thought-

  oh i saw the shack all right but it cost
me a fib and i got found out in it he
grinned at segovias puzzled look and
started dressing miss taylor he went
on was in front and i stopped and spoke
with her thats what did the business
for me i ought to have put on more speed
instead of slowing down

 what did you say in this newer
interest segovia forgot the paper he was
holding

  jimmy sketched the interview lightly
omitting as immaterial the incident of the
rose

 and by george he added i ran
plump into her as i was coming out of
brewers place she and mrs morales
were taking the air in the morales car
if she mentions it to you enrique tell her
i was just poking about the country prying
into more nooks and comers we dont
want to advertise the hacienda at tins stage
of the game

  segovia delayed his answer until it caused
jimmy to throw an inquiring glance at him
then it came

  why not tell miss taylor the truth
she is american you dont have to talk
with her long to find out her detestation of
german methods in this world war
jimmy in turn delayed his answer under
pretext of undoing a knot in his shoe-laces
at last he said

  do you know enrique i have arrived at
the conclusion that our friend morales is
a deuced shrewd old bird here he has
an american as an intimate guest in his
home who would suspect him of plotting
against american interests i wouldnt
if i didnt know what i do and i rather
think youd have hard work convincing
miss taylor of it if you succeeded she
couldnt stay on as morales guest and if
she left his house she would also have to
leave cortina or morales would get wise
to what had happened then good-by
to the plans weve laid

  segovia was compelled to admit the force
for the flag



of jimmys logic but he made a weak stand
against it

  i thought that if she knew she might
pick up some information for us she is

in a position-

  jimmy calmly interrupted him

  you didnt think any such thing
enrique you said that without thinking
to eat a mans salt and spy on him isnt
a job youd set for your sister if you had
one and im blamed sure you wouldnt
set it for miss taylor

  oh hang it jimmy lets drop it
exclaimed enrique reddening darkly i
hadnt thought of it in that light here
is something that will entertain you-in
la cronica our leading newspaper i
didnt see it until after youd gone

  jimmy could read spanish better than
he could speak it as he mastered the
interminable sentences of the little article
segovia pointed out his face crimsoned with
annoyance

  in brief jimmy was hailed as the only
scion of a powerful american millionaire
with connections of political importance at
washington he was a young man of
brilliant parts and promise and he was
now in cortina to visit his old college class-
mate in virginia the senor don enrique
segovia the two were to be the guests
at dinner on thursday night at the home
of the senor don manuel morales the
eminent banker where mr perry would
have the pleasure of meeting a fair com-
patriot miss mary taylor the distin-
guished author and traveler who was but
just arrived in cortina from an extended
stay in guatemala and who was the
honored guest of the senora dona morales

  great snakes sputtered jimmy who
the devil put this rot in the paper about me
i wondered said segovia mr lane
do you think

  lane hes not a fool snapped
jimmy who wants to be paraded in
print like this at any time and especially
at a time when one seeks to move about
with as little noise as possible lane
knows that this is some of morales
doings enrique he has made me a
marked man and under the cover of a
compliment a friend of the nephew of
the secretary of state-look out for him
its a warning to the anti-administration
crowd

  it does look like it agreed segovia

i wish theyd start something in the open
this waiting gets on my nerves

  and mine echoed jimmy im pray-
ing for kaufman to come back harder than
i ever prayed for a touchdown oh i say
i havent told you about the dandy bird-
cage ive found for our hun we got
shunted off from it

  he recounted the pertinent details of his
visit to brewer and described the strong-
room and the defensive properties of the
house they discussed the possibility of
a rescue party and segovia expressed him-
self as heartily in favor of arming the de-
fenders of the rural citadel he could
manage easily to get the rifles he would
speak to his uncle about it or to ortega

  of course i shall be with you jimmy
he declared when their conference was
ended i am a private citizen now and
can do as i please

  he glanced at his watch and got up

  of course you wont be with us con-
tradicted jimmy your place is here
in the city to ward off suspicion from the
farm if we both disappear along with
kaufman it will give his friends a twin clue
to follow

  it doesnt seem fair but i suppose you
are right conceded segovia reluctantly

  thats a good boy jimmy grinned
at him and added artfully-by the way
i forgot to tell you that the automobile
took miss taylors eye immensely-espe-
cially when she learned that it was yours
segovia tried to appear unconcerned in
the face of this announcement

  im glad she liked it he said carelessly
and that reminds me im due in half an
hour to drive miss taylor to the state
department to see my uncle she wants
to ask him questions about the country-
things like that

  jimmy clapped him  the shoulder

  go to it old man we are here today
and gone tomorrow in between weve
got to show some speed or we wont get
anywhere lets go down and have some-
thing with a lime and a straw in it before
you start im dry as a boneyard

after enrique had gone jimmy
cast about him for something to do
that would while away the time
it was twelve oclock

  billy smith he ejaculated amusing
little beggar ill have him to lunch


adventure

  he called up the legation smith of
pittsburgh himself answered

oh he said when he learned who it
was youre the powerful son of that
brilliant millionaire ive been reading about
gosh im all swelled up at knowing you
stow it jimmy bade him im

thinking of having lunch will you-

  a whisper broke in on him

  his nibs isnt here gone to the state
department business or something
by george thats funny spoke out
jimmy before he thought he pictured a
meeting with miss taylor

  a scream aint it concurred smith
john henry thinks hes working
confound you jimmy shot at him
see if you can listen to me ten seconds
without butting in i was up early and
im getting hungry will you come over
and have lunch with me thats what i

started out to say when you-

  say no more or you may take it back
entreated billy earnestly ill fix it up
with whittaker and come on the run and
ill think up the most expensive dishes on
the way what is money to the powerful

son of a-

  go to the devill jimmy barked at him
and hung up

  half an hour later they were seated
companionably by a wide shaded window
in the europas dining-room with a bottle
of moselle between them except for
themselves the place was deserted for the
hour was early for luncheon they had
finished their cold consomme when billy
remarked

  look here jimmy why is lane asking
for a warship off puerto mono oh you
neednt look innocent it was after your
jazz with his mightiness yesterday that he
sent the cable whittaker told me
jimmy answered him frankly

  i cant talk about that billy

  the others broad face beamed

  good for you i like you all the better
for it but i just want to observe that
im not as blind as a bat or as deaf as a post
and i know something is up what it is i
cant guess but if it comes to a show-
down and i can help remember please
my name and address i speak german
he supplemented with a knowing nod
there are one hundred thousand of them
in pittsburgh thirty thousand foreign-
born

  i wont forget jimmy assured him
warmly

  perhaps i ought to tell you added
billy with a half-defiant half-apologetic
air that my grandfather was a full-
blooded german-from wurttemberg his
name was wilhelm schmidt im the
americanized edition and if you ask me
ill say that im not ashamed of my german
descent but- he rapped the table with
his knuckles-im a yankee from my
gizzard out and ill fight anv man who says
im not

  jimmy reached over and seized- his
hand

  not me old chap we stand shoulder
to shoulder old glory forever

  both were on their feet with the words
old glory-god bless it responded
billy he drained his glass and snapped
the stem

  they went on with their lunch in new
good-fellowship and with an exchange of
those large views of life that are at once
the hope and hopelessness of youth then
came a sudden digression

  ha exclaimed billy i know that
girl with lieutenant segovia

  in the street immediately in front of the
window an automobile had slowed down
for a jam at the hotel entrance in the
waiting car were segovia and miss taylor
they did not chance to turn their eyes in
jimmys direction and they were gone
the instant after

  you say you know the girl jimmy
asked curiously

  i mean billy corrected that ive
seen her before i dont know her name
where did you see her

  in the canal zone i took a run down
there last week a little vacation i got
back monday it was at the gatun locks
i came across her sunday morning she
was off one of those jamaica boats i guess
she didnt see me i was only a wart on
the water wall to her but by jinks she
didnt miss anything about the working
of the locks she was in a regular trance
over it

  and did you see her after that

 no she went on to panama i
didnt ive a friend on one of the ships at
colon and i wanted to look him up before
my boat left

  jimmy toyed with his coffee-spoon

  do you know he said presently i
for the flag



think you are mistaken in this girl who has
just passed

  oh sure snorted billy aggrievedly
i wouldnt know a good-looker like that
after only five days id forget those cute
little curls and-and by gosh that sailor
hat with the harvard ribbon oh boy
ask me if i could be mistaken in my own
three sisters ive got at home id swear
to her in a million

  just the same you are barking up the
wrong tree my lad insisted jimmy
youve read that nauseous article in la
cronica well the girl youve just seen with
lieutenant segovia is miss mary taylor
what of it where does that put me
in wrong demanded billy

  why miss taylor has just arrived here
from an extended stay in guatemala the
paper says therefore she could not have
been at gatun last sunday

  billy leaned back in his chair and stared
at jimmy

  pinch me he implored if what you
say is so im dreaming i made that trip to
the canal

chapter x

the camp at arraca

at yoro on the line of the cortina and
puerto mono railway a branch line
strikes off to the southeast and after bump-
ing the unhappy traveler over thirty miles
of villainous road-bed brings him with a
final bump into the terminal station at
arraca on the rio negro back of the
town to the south and west the virgin
forest extends in a mighty area unbroken
save for the black deep waters of the river
which creeps through it and out finally into
the jungles of the coast levels and on to
the caribbean sea where it debouches
twenty miles below puerto mono

  the german syndicates timber conces-
sion lay on both sides of the rio negro
beginning at a point one mile above arraca
it was verboten to the townspeople and to
all strangers unless provided with a permit
from the intendant at the arraca road
gate the tract was heavily wired off in
the neighborhood of the town and rangers
saw to it that other points of access were
guarded from intruders

  for two years now the operations at the
camp had been as a sealed book to all but

those intimately concerned with them
rafts of valuable hardwood were floated
down the river to the sea and there loaded
on waiting ships this was public knowl-
edge for the rest no one knew what
went on but far in the timber there were
things to be seen worth while

  a great open square like a military
parade-ground bordered the river on
one side were the bunk-houses of the
loggers in each house behind a locker
door was a gunrack and each gun in the
rack was a well-oiled mauser on the
other side of the square a row of small
cottages sheltered the gangmasters-offi-
cers quarters they would have been called
elsewhere a large two-story structure
stood at the head of the square facing the
stream the lower part was used as a
commissariat and the upper part as a club-
house for those in authority in the com-
missariat in addition to the usual stores
was a battery of machine guns cloaked care-
fully from view

  down at the river a number of swift sea-
going motor launches were moored to the
landing-stage and in midstream a big flat-
boat for floating freight up from the sea
swung to anchor on the opposite river
bank were several huge metal tanks filled
with gasoline and petroleum

  all this paraphernalia with the exception
of the guns could have been plausibly
explained to a chance visitor but not so the
stout mast with its wireless antenna that
rose high above the surrounding trees back
of the club-house this apparatus was
assuredly an oddity in a lumber camp and
hence the curious and uncurious alike were
halted at the concession gate

  in the late afternoon of the day on which
jimmy perry in cortina was entertaining
at lunch his friend from pittsburgh herr
adolph kaufman the imperial german
envoy totzanhoria was seated in a room
of the club-house on the rio negro led-
gers balance-sheets and other business
records were spread out on the table before
him three men of a military carriage
bore the minister company they were
in fact reservist officers of the imperial
army though here in zanhoria they mas-
queraded as plain lumbermen kaufman
himself was anything but a martial figure
yet in his day he had served with the colors
he was short and ruddy with a paunch
a beard and heavy-lidded eyes under great


adventure

bushy brows-a coarse gross bowelless
product of beef and beer and overweening
racial self-sufficiency

  i think we have finished gentlemen
he said the affairs of the syndicate are
in satisfactory order and my inspection
of the property shows that it is being
worked to the maximum advantage our
quarterly report will read well i con-
gratulate you as for the greater matter
which engages us senor morales as i have
told you has had word from me to issue
a call to his committee for sunday night-
a final consultation after that it remains
only to hear from general peralta and
strike

  i suppose there can be no doubt of this
committee excellency in the test it
was a question from one who sat directly
opposite the minister

  if kaufman answered direfully i
should give hurango their names they
would be stood up to a wall and shot i
could do it and sit safe myself and they
know this yes captain karsch i am sure
of the committee-quite

  a gaunt towering man who had been
reflectively drawing on his pipe put it aside
and spoke he had the brusk manner of
one who is accustomed to being heard

  let us recapitulate general peralta
is off jamaica in his yacht sea bird with
fifty chosen men here at arraca we have
four hundred and fifty men and in the
capital we have one hundred and twenty
men detailed to strategic points at the given
moment ja wohl on the night of the
designated day i will dispatch by way of
the river to puerto mono one hundred men
in command of captain karsch to seize the
cable station and cover peraltas landing
with their machine guns

  i will leave fifty men to patrol the camp
and with the rest take possession of the
railroad cut the telegraph and proceed to
cortina on the pacific slope lieutenant
baer will take care of the cortina and
boaco railroad this will complete the
investment of the city before aid can
reach hurango we shall have peralta in his
chair-that is if morales and his people
do their part am i correct herr kauf-
man

  with two small exceptions colonel
ludolf

  and they are

  the zanhorian national guard for one

  pooji colonel ludolf blew the guard
into ineffectual fragments a mere
rabble

they are six hundred strong

i j in cortina said herr kaufman

    	quietly we are counting on de-
fections to peralta but not until he is at

the gates of the city

  pooi scoffed the officer again we
shall take the town by surprise under
cover of darkness we shall have the
arsenal what can they do against us
your other point if you please

  the designated day that is an un-
known quantity as yet and everything
hinges on it if the legation wireless had
not broken down i would have had news
from general peralta by this miss prietz
has undoubtedly arrived in cortina from
jamaica with letters from him-informa-
tion he would not dare wire from the sea
bird it may be that we shall hear at any
moment now

  the fourth man considerably younger
than the others had been listening in
silence he ventured a remark here a
pleasantry it seemed

  havent we in all this overlooked the
zanhorian navy excellency

  kaufman chuckled at the sally the
zanhorian navy consisted solely and wholly
of an antiquated gunboat-a relic of the
spanish-american war-mounting one four-
inch gun fore and aft and a secondary
battery of three-pounders

  our u will attend to the navy if neces-
sary karl he said but i am informed
by the peralta party at puerto mono that
they have admiral terrozas well in hand
they probably have promised him a second-
hand torpedo boat to add to his fleet

  the laugh that greeted this was checked
by a knock at the door

  come in called ludolf

  the wireless operator entered he
saluted tendered the colonel a code mes-
sage he had just taken and retired

  ha from cortina exclaimed the
minister

  no from the u announced the
colonel he deciphered the dispatch
kaufman looked his disappointment

  where is von kumpel he inquired
sourly

  at his base matina cay he asks
for oil

m
for the flag



  matina cay was a palm-grown islet forty
miles off the mouth of the rio negro
ludolf turned to the young man kaufman
had addressed as karl

  see to it lieutenant hecht-two hun-
dred gallons be ready to start at dark
show the usual lights when you have
cleared the river

  hecht left the room colonel ludolf
drew a sheet of paper to him and set about
answering the submarine

  have you any word for kumpel he
inquired of kaufman

  kaufman thought a moment

  i am returning to cortina on the evening
train and shall see miss prietz tomorrow
he said presently you might say to von
kumpel that he shall know the day it is
likely by tomorrow night

  colonel ludolf prepared his message and
requested captain karsch to see that it
was sent when karsch was gone he said
to the minister

  it is not possible that hurango is totally
in ignorance of our movements the thing
is unbelievable and yet you say there is
no evidenceof disquiet in his official family
i repeat it kaufman stated gruffly
our precautions have been such that not
a whisper has reached them if it were
otherwise there would be some stir in the
departments all is quiet as the grave
ludolf knitted his brows but he knew
kaufman argument would only irritate
him

  and the american envoy is he too
asleep he asked

  lane kaufman pursed his mouth
in a poof of his own he snores-ein narr
sein lcben lang 

  the officer smiled his recognition of the
phrase and rose

  if you must take that train mein herr
we had better be moving he suggested
the horses are ready

  herr kaufman lifted himself from his
chair in quick response

  i wouldnt miss it for tiie black
eagle he declared miss prietz will
have news for me a remarkable woman
colonel jat the best i believe that
we have on this side the water she has
done excellent work in all the isthmian
states they will fall in line if peralta
succeeds then we shall see-eh-the
united states of central america and
confusion at washington

  colonel ludolf came to a salute his
eyes glittered

  hoch dcr kaisert he intoned in his
heavy bass

  he marched to the door and stood aside
kaufman bowed and passed out before him
he walked with a slight limp

a man loitered along the platform
as the train for yoro and cortina
pulled out when it had bumped
around the curve beyond the water-tank
the man loitered on to the post-office in the
public square and asked for a telegraph
blank on this he wrote

   look for your package on arraca train tonight

  the telegram was addressed to a cigar
store on the plaza central in cortina

chapter xi

the woman in gray

jimmy and billy smith were lounging
over their after-luncheon cigars in the
rotunda of the europa when the hotel motor
bus deposited at the door a lone woman
guest a page received her suit-case and
conducted her to the desk she was an in-
conspicuous little body in traveling gray
as she passed them jimmy noticed that
she was not old and that her face was small
and dark and plain at the same instant
he was conscious of being swept in by
eyes-himself and billy and the entire place
-with one swift comprehensive glance

  german murmured billy

  no cuban spanish blood anyway
said jimmy

  cigars on it

  done

  they were too far away to catch her con-
versation with the clerk one mr ricardo
gomez who spoke half a dozen languages
with a reckless fluency that answered for
whatever shortcomings of construction it
betrayed but when at length the page had
led the lady to the ascensor to be taken up
to her room billy sauntered over to the
desk he came back after a few minutes
his short nose was twitching comically

  we both lose he stated

  what is she

  guess she is registered as mrs re-
becca isaacs of new york speaks english
ricky says as well as he does


adventure

  jimmy laughed

  ill buy just the same but i say this
is the train i came in on theres no boat
due to-day

  elders  pinsch line-freight from
jamaica billy told him good old scows
if you are not looking for speed well ive
got to toddle along or whittaker will be hav-
ing a fit any message for his loftiness

  only my love jimmy grinned come
on and have your cigar

  i guess not returned billy indignantly
if i do belong to the down-trodden poor i
can still manage to find the price of a smoke
for a rich friend i got it off of whittaker
before i came around here

  jimmy knocked about the lobby list-
lessly for a while after billy had left him
time hung heavily on his hands he had
no appointment with enrique for the after-
noon but it was likely he would look him
up when he returned from his outing with
miss taylor at night enrique was to dine
with him at the hotel

  jimmy yawned he wished now that he
had gone with billy to the legation lane
might have news of some kind to give him
he might have heard from washington
congress might have acted on the presi-
dents war message if it had lane would
of course get immediate word he glanced
at the office clock it was  no lane
probably was at lunch or possibly he was
still at the state department

  jimmy decided to go up to his room and
take a siesta later he would walk around
to the legation he had himself carried up
to his floor as he stepped from the eleva-
tor he saw issuing from the room across the
corridor from his the new arrival he lifted
his hat as they met and then stopped sud-
denly and spoke

  i beg your pardon-your glove

   it had slipped from her hand as she passed
him

  thank you ever so much she said and
proceeded to the waiting lift

  new york all right jimmy confided
to himself and not from baxter street
wonder what shes doing down this way
alone

  he made ready for his nap and went to
the windows to darken them as he stood
fumbling with the cords of the jalousies he
saw mrs isaacs making her way from the
hotel across the plaza he watched the little
gray figure indolently it took the path

leading to the northeast corner of the square
and disappeared in the calle commercio

  going to see lane has troubles of her
own surmised jimmy but shell have
to pass billy first id like to hear what he
says to her

  he smiled sleepily and turned to his bed

it seemed to jimmy that he had
barely closed his eyes when he was
awakened by a pounding on the
door the voice of billy smith came to him
demanding to know if he were alive or
dead

  i was half-way between contwist you
jimmy shouted to him irately cant you
let a man have hjs nap in peace

  he got up nevertheless and opened the
door

  nap burst out billy as he entered
if you started in when i left youve sawed
enough wood to build a house its five
oclock heres a cable for you it came
just as we were shutting up shop and say
the devils broke loose it looks like lane
got a hurry-up call from the state depart-
ment an hour ago and went off in a cloud
of fuss and feathers

  jimmy was reading his cable it was
from his father and it said

  satisfactory got a bet down on you

  good old dad he murmured affection-
ately he looked up at billy what were
you saying about lane

  billy rolled his eyes ceilingward

  i said he had a toothache and had gone
to have it out

  jimmy threw a pillow at him

  talk sense or ill drown you in the
bathtub what has happened

  if i knew id be at the department in-
stead of john henry its something whit-
taker even doesnt know his- prominency
got a dispatch from washington today in
the private cipher and decoded it himself
then he went to see senor valera now
hes gone again in answer to valeras s o s
its to do with that dispatch or im a hindu
the warship maybe what

  maybe said jimmy as he pulled on his
shoes they are getting up a dance ive
known men to go off their heads over a thing
like that

  you go hang retorted billy he
perched himself on the writing-table and
swung his legs to and fro you cant get
for the flag



by me with that sort of bunk youre
just as full of curiosity as i am to know
whats doing

  well yes i am conceded jimmy
but im going to keep the cork in until it
will do some good to draw it he added
with a tinge of seriousness- this war
we are in billy-or will be when congress
acts-is going to start a lot of things to
happening

  he plunged his face into the washbowl
billy regarded the broad shoulders turned
to him with schoolboy admiration

  yes and right here he remarked when
jimmy withdrew his face from the bowl
you said you wouldnt forget me and
take it from your uncle ezra mr ready-
cash im not going to let you i can shoot
swim sail a boat drive a car and i wouldnt
balk at an airplane if  was put to it
shi

  jimmy raised his hand he had heard he
thought a movement just outside his door
he strode to it and opened it a little
figure in gray was in the act of inserting a
key in the door across the hall her back
was to him and he drew in quietly

  what the sam hill ails you queried
billy

  jimmy softly lowered his transom then
he said with a lurking grin

  i have a neighbor a mrs rebecca
isaacs of new york

  oh so shes on this floor

  as i have said you had a call from her
this afternoon something tells me
something lies to you then rejoined
billy but he evinced interest in this new
topic queer i was going to speak to you
about this mrs ikev what made you say
that

  a little while after you left i saw her go
out she turned into your street there
are no shops up that way so i thought she
was going to you to have a grouch re-
moved

  billy grinned back at him

  wrong again she didnt stop she
didnt give us even a look she went
straight on to the german legation and
blew in i watched her struck me as kind
of funny an american going into that joint
i kept an eye open but i didnt see her
come out missed her i guess but she
couldnt have been there all that time-
hardly

  um grunted jimmy he was busy

with his cravat you said she came in
from jamaica he was recalling what
billy had surmised of miss taylor-that
she too had come from the island

  ricky said she did the boy replied
she might have come from anywhere on
the puerto mono road

  arraca

  the german concession aha i be-
gin to smell a mouse and that warship
look here jimmy is it because im in the
service that you wont let me in on what
is up

  partly

  the young fellow jumped down from the

table

  darn the service he yapped ill
cut it thats what

  not so loud jimmy cautioned ive
a neighbor please remember and further-
more my son youll stick to that job of
yours for a while anyway ive made you
a promise i mean to keep if i see a chance
to use you thats all youll get out of me
for the present will you be a good boy or
wont you

  ill be good vowed billy meekly

  jimmy put on his hat and with a cats
tread went to the door he opened it with
a quick jerk

  im going down come on he said

  when for the second time that afternoon
he liad parted with billy in the hotel lobby
jimmy watched for a chance to speak pri-
vately with the clerk he thought he had
seen mrs isaacs door close as he stepped
out from his room had she been listening
in the hall

  jimmy acknowledged that the incident
in itself was trivial he would not have
given it a thought were it not for what billy
had told him of the womans visit to the
german mission this nagged at his un-
derstanding the fingers of his mind twid-
dled with it irresolutely why should thifc
person on the instant of her arrival in the
city seek out the representatives of a nation
with which her own country was on the
brink of war it did not somehow look
right and yet what was wrong with it
her errand may have been simply to ask
information on a business matter-ger-
mans were active in business in all the cen-
tral american states

  deuce take it he grumbled i asked
that boy to lunch for entertainment and i
get a bunch of worries handed me he saw


adventure

miss taylor in the south when she came
from the north and he saw this mrs isaacs
hobnobbing with the huns when she should
have been gossiping with him i cant
make head or tail of it

  his opportunity came and he went over
to the desk

  i see you have another visitor from the
states he remarked casually to the mul-
tilingual ricardo

  si mr perree a lady with sorrows
sir from what i make intelligence un-tio
a hunkle who loses himself and she have
make to trace him by porto rico san do-
mingo cuba jamaica-di grado in grado-
and now enfin she achieve to this locale
oh she has heard of him then

  but a whisper mr perree some one
she have seen in kingston have remark him
in cortina at the german legation

  but she is an american a jew from

new york how is it that her uncle-

  ah i myself make question to her of
that con discrecion he is born in germany
he departs away before the war there is
property to divide un hermano who dead is
in chikkago her padre is enfermo and she
must come with herself toule seule

  and what did she learn at the legation
jimmy asked

  mr gomez shrugged his shoulders to
his ears

  no sc she have her key and do not
cease by me when she return

  i hope she finds him jimmy said and
walked away to himself he said jews
dont send their women-folk chasing about
the world alone it sounds pretty thin to
me

  he brought up with a grunt of surprise
segovia was coming toward him and his
air was anxious and harassed

  hello jimmy saluted him i wasnt
expecting you till seven

  segovia drew him aside

  the dinner must wait he said my
uncle desires to see you it is important
will you come at once jimmy please

  i certainly will do we drive

  no we will walk we must avoid at-
tention

  then laugh a little prompted jimmy
and well ease out of this as if we were
going on a lark and not to a funeral act
the part enrique

  he followed his own advice and segovia
made out to play up to him when they

were in the street they strolled west along
the square to the calle central here they
turned northward jimmy seized the op-
portunity when no one was within close
hearing to put the question that was clamor-
ing in him for utterance

  what has broken loose old man slip
it to me with a smile-the world is looking
on

  segovia endeavored to comply but his
smile was more of a grimace than a gladden-
ing twist of the features

  an important state paper is missing
from my uncles office he said a wash-
ington dispatch mr lane brought it
the devil of it is jimmy uncle luis missed
it only a short time after miss taylor and i
were there he sent for me but there was
nothing i could tell him of course how
could there be the thing is past under-
standing

  jimmy did not comment on this in-
stead he asked-

  do you know what the paper was
about

  my uncle will tell you segovia an-
swered but in a word it was a warning
to our government saying that general
peralta is in jamaica and is planning an
armed descent on zanhoria

  jimmy whistled softly

  so they got on to it in washington by
jove uncle sam isnt so slow as the ger-
mans think he is

chapter xii

the stolen state paper

they came finally to the plaza mayor
with the government buildings to the
east and west and the executive mansion
embowered in its gardens to the north

  we are going to don luis valeras
office queried jimmy who until now had
manifested no curiosity touching their des-
tination

  no segovia replied we are going
to see the president we will slip in by the
side entrance we are expected there

  um the devil is to pay sure enough
exclaimed jimmy to himself

   still pursuing their role of leisurely pedes-
trians taking the evening air they sauntered
across the great square with its bronze
equestrian statue of franciso zamora the
liberator and debouched at the east end of
for the flag



the white house of the zanhorian repub-
lic they strolled north along the low gar-
den wall as they came to an opening in it
segovia stopped a sergeant of police was
loitering toward them segovia spoke to
him a low-breathed word

  vayase he answered and passed on

  quick in with you segovia said to
jimmy and followed on his heels

  they were swallowed up in the shrubbery
and made their way swiftly to a door under
a small portico at the farther end of the walk

  they were as segovia had said expected
the door opened as they approached a
man in plain black who stood unobtru-
sively back in the entrance looked narrowly
at segovia bowed and noiselessly closed
the door after them he conducted them up
a corridor and across a colonnaded patio in
which a tinkling fountain made pleasant
music a lemon-tree grew by the fountain
and there were roses and jasmine in bloom
all about above the first stars were blos-
soming in the sky

  from the patio they entered another cor-
ridor and were invited into a waiting-room
overlooking the court their attendant
disappeared a moment later a young man
came in he bowed ceremoniously to
jimmy and went with extended hand to
segovia

  ola amigo como le va he exclaimed
cordially

  segovia introduced him to jimmy he
was the senor don leon machada presi-
dent hurangos private secretary after
a few courteous words he begged the young
men to follow him they passed down to
the end of the corridor and were ushered
into a spacious rose-tinted chamber where
advancing to meet him jimmy beheld the
hon john henry lane there were three
others in the room-don luis valera don
emilio ortega and a massive old man with
piercing black eyes and a lined strong face
he had risen as the secretary announced
the callers and with a friendly gesture to
segovia stood waiting his eyes intent on
jimmy

  mr lane had received a personal cable
that afternoon from senator perry it com-
mended jimmy to his care and he was glow-
ingly filled with the responsibility he con-
ducted his charge to the fine old man tower-
ing above his entourage

  mr president he said unctuously i
have the honor to present mr james perry

jr of virginia his father is one of our
very influential citizens and his uncle
united states senator allan s perry is
chairman of the senate committee on for-
eign relations

 president hurango shook hands with
jimmy

  you are very welcome mr perry i
speak your tongue but indifferently though
i am better i hope in the understanding
of it

  sir replied jimmy with an aptness
which astonished himself if i could say in
as good spanish what you have just said in
english i should consider myself a master
of the language

  a smile went the round of the room
mr lane swelled with pride the chief
executive was manifestly pleased

  thank you he said simply please
sit down mr perry

  the door was again opened by the private
secretary and a seventh man was shown in
he wore a wax-pointed mustache and car-
ried himself jimmy fancied a little pre-
tentiously he brought his hand up in a
military salute to the president this cere-
mony performed he bowed to the others of
the group and strode forward he was
jimmy learned when presented to him
general don alfredo barrios minister of
war and marine

  a silence settled on the company presi-
dent hurango motioned to don luis valera
who turned to jimmy

  this mr perry is a secret conference
to decide on a line of action for the protec-
tion of the state his excellency the presi-
dent has been made aware of your interest in
the events that are pending and the patri-
otic reasons that influence you it is be-
cause of this that he has requested the honor
of your presence he wished to be made
acquainted with you

  jimmy was in something of a flutter at
the attention concentrated on him but he
bowed his acknowledgment and don luis
proceeded

  we have come to a pass in which it is
necessary to abandon the pretense of official
ignorance of what you propose though at
tiie same time we must continue to main-
tain the appearance of it in short mr
perry our hand has been forced and yet
not to the point where we can take open
action against our enemies his excellency
the american minister will perhaps be good


adventure

enough to explain what has transpired to-
day

  lane not in the least unwilling to take
the center of the stage hemmed with for-
ensic momentousness and began

ess i received james a dispatch
mjgp from the state department at wash-
ington and was charged to transmit
it without delay to the zanhorian govern-
ment this disptach stated that informa-
tion had reached washington from a reliable
source to the effect that general frederico
peralta is in hiding on the southern jamai-
can coast with certain followers and is plan-
ning a descent on zanhoria in support of
this news was the further information that
a large white yacht has been seen standing
off and on in the neighborhood presumably
to take on the peralta party when they are
ready to launch their coup

  how about the jamaican government
asked jimmy as the minister paused do
they know this

  the crown governor has been informed
by washington lane replied and will
doubtless take steps to thwart the filibus-
ters if he is not too late peralta has
chosen no doubt an inaccessible point for
his rendezvous it is in view of these facts
james that we are met here tonight the
dispatch that i handed to his excellency
senor valera today is missing from his
office or rather one of the three copies
made of it by his excellencys secretary for
the various departments of the govern-
ment has disappeared

  i presented the note to senor valera at
one oclock we were in conference on it
until two between those hours-nearer
one than two i should say-senor segovia
and miss mary taylor called senor va-
lera sent out a request to his nephew to re-
turn later and- lane came to a pause
then he added-and that i believe mr
secretary is the extent of my personal
knowledge of the-ah-ahumph-calamity
that has befallen

  good lord thought jimmy wont
they ever get to the point

  it was on the tip of his tongue to put the
question that was once propounded by a
celebrated personage of his own country-
who do you suspect but he checked
the impulse these diplomats had their
ways and who was he to try to change
them

   senor valera took up the thread of the
 american ministers narrative

   my confidential secretary was at his
 lunch during the time of his excellencys
 call on me he came in shortly afterward
 and i instructed him to copy the note in
 triplicate meanwhile the deputy senor
 carrera from the province of puerto mono
 came in to see me his errand was of im-
 portance and we were in consultation for
 upward of an hour

   it was during our conference that my
 secretary placed the note and copies on my
 desk as the senor carrera withdrew my
 nephew and miss taylor were again an-
 nounced i invited them in with the inten-
 tion of asking miss taylors indulgence if i
 begged her to postpone our appointed in-
 terview to another day at this moment
 senor carrera reappeared at the door
 there was something he had omitted to
 say and i stepped outside to hear him
 the papers remained on my desk

   i was gone possibly five minutes when
 i returned i spoke with miss taylor briefly
 after which she and my nephew departed
 i went into my secretarys room to say a
 word to him and then made ready to de-
 liver in person a copy of the note to the
 president and another afterward to gen-
 eral barrios at the war department it
 was at this juncture that i discovered that
 one of the three copies was missing

   the room was still as don luis finished
 jimmy glanced at enrique he returned
 it with a somber look senor ortega jimmy
 observed was lying back in the corner of a
 small wicker canape his eyes half-closed
 the war secretary was fingering his mus-
 tache with ill-concealed impatience presi-
 dent hurango sat impassively in his great
 armchair so placed that it commanded the
 entire company he spoke

   i deemed it proper that you should learn
 in detail these facts mr perry i have but
 one question to ask-these friends at the
 rafael fernandez hacienda-you can rely
 on them

 they are americans sir said jimmy
 there was the flash of a smile in ortegas
 eyes at the response the president bowed
 and turning from jimmy addressed the com-
 pany in general

   we are not so much concerned at pres-
 ent with the identity of the person who ab-
 stracted the dispatch as with the effect the
 information it gives will have upon the
for the flag



 enemies of the state it will i am inclined
 to believe precipitate action on their part
 our consideration should be directed then
 to the specific means of circumventing them
 before they can strike

  the war secretary was not in favor of
secret measures it appeared

  i would suggest the immediate suspen-
sion of the civil authority he put forth in
spanish and with a fierce twirl of his mus-
tache

  your excellency it was segovia

  he was on his feet pale and greatly
stirred

the president motioned him to proceed
i can not consent sir segovia said
to sit on in silence under the imputation
that rests upon myself and my companion

of the afternoon-

  enrique don luis valeras voice rose
in stem protest the president has dis-
posed of that question and the countrys
welfare waits

  your excellency may i not defend my
honor before you-now while the lash
stings appealed the young man passion-
ately my life is my countrys but my
honor is my own can not my country spare
to me a moment for the defense of that
without which my life is an unworthy gift
to her

  the old man in the chair inclined bis head
to him in grave sympathy the hot blood
had once burned in his own veins and he
remembered it

  speak on don enrique he invited
though i will say that your loyalty has not
for an instant been in doubt

  then sir it is a question of probity be-
tween the deputy senor carrera and miss
taylor there were no other callers senor
valera accounts for the deputy i account
for miss taylor which of the two may i
inquire is accused-the deputy or miss tay-
lor his tone was derisive as he challenged
the faces before him

don luis turned from him with
an expression of severe intolerance
but the state superintendent of po-
lice from his corner on the sofa answered the
question with a question it was gently put

  you were seated don enrique while
awaiting the return of his excellency from
the door

  yes senor

  near the desk

  not far from it at the end facing the
door

  and neither of you moved

  segovia hesitated but it passed and he
said-

  i crossed the room to draw a glass of
water from the cooler in the corner

  for miss taylor-at her request

  it was senor superintendent there
was a strained sarcasm in the reply and
i will say-for it is that you are leading up
to i infer-that my back was not turned to
miss taylor thirty seconds if as much
the lady is distinguished as an author
senor not as a prestidigitator

  he sat down defiantly

  no slightest offense intended my dear
friend disclaimed ortega blandly and
when you left the department

  i drove miss taylor home

  to the senor morales house

  yes senor she is the guest of the
senora morales and i will call your atten-
tion to the outstanding fact that miss tay-
lor is an american and entitled to the pro-
tection of his excellency here the american
minister

  the hon john henry lane moved un-
comfortably in his seat to all except the
obsessed segovia the deductions to be
drawn from the superintendents inquisi-
tion were obvious ortega relieved the
situation he addressed the president in
mild regret

  you see sir the mystery remains un-
solved

  president hurango impassive as ever
made a motion of assent

  we will let it rest there until a more
convenient time what we must consider
now are the steps for our defense

  general barrios answered him

  i have had the honor sir to advance a
suggestion

  the president shook his head

  i am of the opinion general that the
better way is that with which i have ac-
quainted you no overt act lias been com-
mitted toparade our strength might check
but would not end this revolutionary move-
ment it would rise again to put it down
quietly by removing the agent provocateur
from the scene appears to me the simpler
method-and the speedier he turned his
penetrating gaze  minister lane are
you in accord with me sir

  the diplomat cleared his throat as if of


adventure

an obstruction that impeded a prompt re-
sponse

  er - ah - ahump - unofficially senor
 hurango i may say that-er-ah-i am

  the president let his eyes pass on to
 jimmy

  mr perry i have decided to adopt your
 plan if you succeed the unexpressed
 thanks of two governments will be yours

  a snort that was converted instantly into
 a cough proceeded from the direction of
 general barrios

  it is not my plan sir jimmy hastened
 to explain it is enriques he thought
 of it

  the old man looked at segovia and
nodded kindly

  yes i know and the hazard of it we
 shall do all that can be done to protect you
 openly we shall be obliged to disavow an
 act that is in violation of the laws of na-
 tions it is not an enviable position for us
 yet i am constrained for the reasons ad-
 vanced to accede to it

  a gentle tap was given at the door and
 machada entered

  a lieutenant of police has brought a
 message for the senor superintendent he
 announced

  he crossed to ortega and handed him a
 printed envelope

  with your permission senor president
 requested the superintendent

  he silently read the message-

  look for your package on arraca train tonight

  ortega glanced at jimmy though his
words were for the president

  your excellency i am able to inform
 you that the imperial german minister is
 returning to the city he will arrive at ten
 oclock tonight

  the guns enrique kaufman wont
wait for the eighth now cried jimmy for-
getful of the presence he was in

  enrique made him an assuring gesture
 he had recovered his poise though his eyes
 still gloomed president hurango rose

  gentlemen i will call this meeting ad-
 journed i think that we shall find refresh-
 ments in the adjoining room if you will
 honor me

  as they went in jimmy discovered or-
tega at his side jimmy addressed him
eagerly

  why not tonight senor

  tomorrow night said the other

  but i dine with senor morales tomor-
row night

  will you wager with me on that mr
perry

  what i say you dont think-

  if you will call at my office tomorrow
at eleven i will tell you what i think re-
plied ortega with an obscure smile in
the meantime shall we lay the wager-say
a ripe banana

  jimmy laughed

  lets be reckless make it two the
loser to eat all four

  but he wondered nonetheless what
ortega could have up his sleeve

chapter xiii

questions and answers

	 he little company dropped away as
they had come one by one and on foot
all with the exception of jimmy and sego-
via-they slipped away together the
police sergeant was loitering on the oppo-
site side of the street as they came out of
the garden jimmy caught a glimpse of
him under a spreading crepe myrtle

  theres don emilios man again piping
us off he observed solely in the hope of
promoting conversation

  enrique had held himself moodily aloof
in the dining-room

  ortega is an ass pronounced the zan-
horian acidly

  what kind chuckled jimmy theres
balaam his ass had better sense than he
had remember it

  segovia ignored the quip

  ortega is a stupid ass those ques-
tions he asked-a child wouldnt have been
as silly what did they lead to nothing
except that miss taylor in half a minute
could have grasped the meaning of that
dispatch stolen it hid it away and settled
back in her chair as cool as a block of ice
in half a minute it couldnt have been
longer

  they were passing under one of the plaza
mayor arc lights jimmy halted

  let us see how long half a minute ac-
tually seems he suggested he had his
watch out now

  segovia interested curiously by the test
pored upon the second hand as it traveled
its tiny orbit the movement was prepos-
terously slow
for the flag



  half a minute jimmy proclaimed at
last quite some time when you come to
count it

  he replaced the watch in his pocket and
they walked on segovia scowled at the
path ahead

  do you mean by that to impute-

  jimmy cut him short

  look here old chap im not imputing
anything to anybody but i want to im-
prove this chance to get something off my
chest and i wouldnt do it please remem-
ber if i didnt think a whole lot of you
shall i go on

  as you wish

  all right i wanted to say it to you
this morning but i couldnt see my way
to it then now i do see it enrique if
i were you i wouldnt get too thick with
miss mary taylor

  that is entirely my affair segovia an-
swered it can not possibly interest any
one but myself

  his tone was coldly forbidding jimmy
braved it

  but it interests me he persisted its
because i dont want to see you left in the
discard when this big deal we are in on is
over ill agree with you from the start in
everything you can say of miss taylors
personal charm shes handsome as a pic-
ture-all that-but when you come down
to bald facts what do you or i know of her
morales is a traitor to his country i
wouldnt believe such a man on his dying
oath why should i believe him when he
says miss taylor is for instance a distin-
guished writer

  she herself told us she was preparing
a series of articles for a magazine and
she told my uncle so today

  oh said jimmy what is her maga-
zine did she say

  we didnt get that far the interview
as you know was brief

  oh said jimmy again and she
hasnt mentioned it to you or anything
about her work

  no we talked of other things

  a rara avis by jove exclaimed jimmy
people let me introduce to your attention
a modest author the only one at large
he laughed though with a covert scru-
tiny of his friend segovia drew himself up
stiffly

  i think we have pursued the subject
far enough he remarked



  only one thing more jimmy inter-
jected miss taylor says she is just ar-
rived from guatemala billy smith of the
united states legation says he saw her in
the canal zone on sunday how do you
account for that amigo mio

  segovia stumbled in his walk caught
himself and went on jimmy could hear
the gasping breath he drew

  where please he asked with forced
calm has mr smith seen miss taylor in
cortina

  he lunched with me today you passed
our window in your car

  mr smith must have been mis-
taken claimed segovia with a desperate
hope

  he says hed swear to her in a million
jimmy told him and for myself ill
add that i dont think shes a born ameri-
can she has the lingo down pat but
theres a wee bit of an accent its been
puzzling me it may be swedish and
then again it may be german i dont
know

  bosh shot out segovia i havent
discovered any such thing you are letting
your imagination run away with you

  they strode on in silence for some time
nearing now the plaza central

  hang it old fellow jimmy exploded

keep mum about this thing you might
let something drop-not meaning to of

fully and theres the hotel come on
in and have an anisette frappe its the
edge of the evening

  he wished to be alone jimmy saw so
he said

wont forget about those guns will you
ive a notion we may need them sooner than
we thought

  it will be attended to segovia an-
swered absently

  with this they parted


adventure

      the young zanhorian proceeded
down the calle central on his way
home he walked slowly revolv-
ing in his mind the disclosure jimmy had
made to him of course smith was mis-
taken yet he cast back a little uneasily to
his conversation with miss taylor in his
car that afternoon as he recalled it-and
with a flush of self-vexation-the talk was
largely about himself his aspirations and
future plans the kind of stuff a sympathetic
woman auditor encourages a man to en-
large upon and too she had asked about
jimmy perry but there was nothing singu-
lar in that he was her countryman it
was natural that she should show an inter-
est in him

  he recalled further that she had inquired
casually if he thought zanhoria would side
with the united states in the war or remain
neutral and if there were not rumors of
trouble in the country she had heard
something of the sort in her journeyings
before coming to cortina was it true
or just political gossip

  it gratified him now to remember that he
had disparaged it had in fact conveyed to
her the impression that it was ridiculed by
the government on the other hand he
was unable for the life of him to attach any
sinister significance to her question there
were as every one knew rumors afloat of
trouble with peralta and if another had
asked his opinion of it he would have seen
nothing strange in it why then mistrust
mary taylor

  segovias thoughts traveled on to the
missing washington dispatch and a doubt
assailed him the devilish leisureliness of
that tiny hand on jimmys watch-dial it
could have been done in the time his back
was turned if one was skilled enough in such
things but mary taylor no no it
was inconceivable and then came a sav-
ing thought

 valgame diosi he exclaimed and
struck his fist triumphantly into his
hand

  they had only the word of his uncles
secretary that three copies were made
don luis had not said that he himself
counted them he was engaged with a
visitor at the time the secretary might
have made a mistake he might have
made only two copies or if three he might
have mislaid one in the mass of papers on his
desk it was possible-probable in fact

he would take the matter up with his uncle
in the morning

  segovia in these communings had come to
the avenida alejandrino he hesitated
and turned into it the day had been
warm mary might be out in front enjoy-
ing the evening cool he might indeed
have a word with her 

  as he came to the house he caught sight
of spectral forms in the loggia-the ghostly
white of sheer lawn dresses he stopped
hung on his heel then takiag hold of his
courage he started up to the door there
was a movement in the loggia the sound of
whispering voices the scrape of a chair on
the floor a man peered over the balus-
trade it was morales

  who comes he questioned

  the tone was not altogether friendly
segovia paused with the feeling that he was
an intruder and yet the hour was not late

  it is i senor morales-enrique sego-
via he answered

  for the space of a breath there was no
response one of the white-clad forms dis-
solved from view morales spoke again

  senor segovia ah oh this is an
unexpected pleasure senor a very delight-
ful surprise one moment please and i
will be down i regret to say that the dona
natalia is not at all well or we should have
you up with us

  a thousand commiserations senor and
i beg of you do not disturb yourself put
in segovia hastily he had no itch for an
exchange of platitudes with the banker
i was out walking he continued and
seeing as i thought the ladies in the loggia
i made bold to come in please assure the
senora morales of my very earnest sympa-
thies and miss taylor of my profound re-
gard

  he was turning away when a silvery
laugh rippled out to him it was followed
by a delightfully mocking voice

  and if miss taylor should choose to
receive the compliment at first-hand mr
segovia she is not at all indisposed her-
self shall she give you proof of it by com-
ing down

  i desire it above all tilings said sego-
via ardendy

  wait was the command

  there was silence overhead miss tay-
lor and likewise her host had gone in the
young man paced the transverse walk by
the door in high feather at his good luck
for the flag



   he was kept waiting some minutes but at
   last miss taylor came out and stood with
   him under the stars

     i have scandalized the dear people in
   there she laughed they are not ameri-
   can-taught as you are

     enrique slowly relinquished the hand she
   had given him

     its awfully good of you he stam-
   mered i dont deserve it

     that sounds as if you had been thinking
   unpleasant things of me she replied but
   you have been walking shall we sit down
   for the small time i have there is a bench
   somewhere-ah here it is now tell me
   what are these unpleasant thoughts youve
   had of me tell me

     the bench was beneath the orange tree
   under which juan lopez had concealed him-
   self pn a sunday night not long before miss
   taylor as she urged her question bent
   toward her companion trying to read his
   face in the dim light her breath caressed
   his cheek intoxicated him

     i have had no such thoughts he swore
   how could i why i walked up this
   way tonight just to be a little nearer to you
   i did not dare to hope for this

      her hand found his rested  it pressed
   it softly before she could withdraw it he
   had snatched it to his lips and covered it
   with kisses

     you silly boy she murmured it is
   only a few hours since we were together
   she disengaged her hand gently i have
   been thinking of our call this afternoon
   and your uncle we were horribly in the
   way-i could see that-yet he was cour-
   tesy itself we shall go again shall we
   not my friend and those letters he will
   give them to me they will help me so
   much with my work

      even in the swirl of his intoxication en-
   rique was penetrated with a ray of reason

 to confound jimmy forevermore he must
   resolve to nothingness the doubts cast upon
   this glorious creature one was already
   dissipated had she purloined the washing-
   ton dispatch she could never have spoken
   with such serene unconcern of her call on
   don luis and she wished to call again
   presto that doubt was gone

     of course we shall go he assured her
   i will remind my uncle of the letters
   what is the name of your magazine i
   dont think you have ever told me

     she appeared surprised

  why havent i its the north ameri-
can gazelle of philadelphia a dreadfully
dry old thing but amazingly respectable
i cant imagine you writing for it he
exclaimed joying in another doubt de-
stroyed if it was poetry now or ro-
mance-something delicate and beautiful-
i could do you know that yesterday
when i met you and learned that you were
so traveled i was really afraid of you at
first then i tried to think of something
touching guatemala to talk with you about
and i couldnt i had been to champerico
once-a yachting cruise-and all i could
remember of it was the smells wasnt it
from champerico you arrived here on mon-
day

  yes she said

  he thrilled with the certainty of this last
doubt dispelled his triumph was com-
plete

  and now-now you are going to stay
with us he exulted we are going to
make it so attractive for you here in cortina
that you will not want to leave you must

know my people-

  in full tide she stopped him lifting her
hand to his arm

  you forget that trouble may come that
there may be other things to think of than
pleasuring my dear friend

  trouble he echoed what trouble
i spoke of it today and you laughed at
me

  oh that wisdom returned and
nudged him the rumors you have heard
i can not weep over them though i will try
if you bid me

  she touched his arm again with a cer-
tain annoyed impatience now

  be serious please your uncle should
know is he not uneasy at these whisper-
ings something surely must have reached
him of them

  i guess he hears a lot of things the
point is you see the revolutionary wolf has
barked so often that nobody pays attention
to it he laughed teasingly youve
got to parade your wolf up to the very door
to make us believe hes going to come in
she did not laugh with him she leaned
his way speaking earnestly

  i cant stay longer but before i go in
i want to tell you that i have learned other
things since i saw you today-information
that may be of value to the state it is one
reason why i came down i am convinced


adventure

that your government is living in a sense
of false security either that or it knows
more than you are aware of

  he parried this

 learned things how from whom
you are a stranger here

  it doesnt matter how it came to me-
it came that is sufficient

 oh may i hope to know what this
information is im prickling with curios-
ity

  his tone seemed to jar upon her

  you still dont take me seriously senor
don enrique segovia so why should i
tell you i think-yes-i will write what
i have learned to your superintendent of
police he would know how to prize my
information i will do it

  she was mocking at him segovia felt

  but i would value it as much he
asserted

 no you would only laugh at me
again and we should quarrel

  she rose from the bench

  dont go he implored i may have
laughed at your fears but at you-it is an
impossibility

  she shook her head

 no i must go positively senor
morales will be calling to me and im
displeased with you im a woman and
you dont talk politics with women isnt
it so you think i wouldnt understand
still  will tell you something listen
she swayed alluringly toward him her
ups touched his ear you are after all
a dear boy and im glad to have you for a
friend

  she ran away from him into the house

  segovia walked home on air all that
mary had said squared with his belief in
her he would let jimmy know how he had
traduced her as for smith he was a plain
blind fool

i i jimmy sat up late that night read-
ejy ing a novel he had begun on the
 boat and had forgotten in the rush
of events he was plumped into it was one
oclock when he laid the book down and
sought his bed sleep did not come to him
he was thinking of the meeting with the
president of zanhoria of kaufmans re-
turn of his appointment with ortega
in the morning of all the happenings of
the day

  it might have been half an hour later

when he heard through his transom a faint
squeak it was the door across the hall
was mrs isaacs coming out or going in
and in either case why was a solitary
woman prowling about at this hour of the
night

  jimmys curiosity whetted by the half-
formed suspicions he entertained moved
him to an act of espionage which under
other circumstances he would have scorned
he got up and opened his door cautiously
to a crack he widened it gently and
peered out into the dim twilight of the hall
mrs isaacs in a long kimono was in the
act of passing through the last door on her
side of the corridor there was the flash
of an electric torch as she disappeared

  it was a rule with jimmy to know his
whereabouts in a strange hotel in the event
of a fire and he knew that the door mrs
isaacs had vanished through gave upon
a flight of stairs to the roof he drew
back into his room mystified and a little
frightened

  great heaven he ejaculated are we
going to have a suicide is she going to
jump off into the street

  he thought of giving an alarm and
thought tetter of it if the woman wanted
to kill herself there were a dozen less ter-
rible ways than that perhaps she was
going up for the air perhaps she wanted
a view of the city by night perhaps 

  oh blast it he scolded himself a
woman is apt to do any fool thing that
comes into her head if she wanted to die
there was the whole caribbean sea she
crossed lots of water and no fuss or
muss

  he went back to bed how long he lay
staring up at the shadowy ceiling he could
not have told but after a time two strokes
of the great bell in the church of our lady
of charity pealed on the night the echo
had scarcely died away when the slightest
of sounds came to jimmy from the end of the
hall a moment or two later the door op-
posite squeaked mrs isaacs had returned
to her room

  keeping me awake like this jimmy
grumbled what the devil was she doing
up there all this time id like to know
looking for that lost relative perhaps
huh

  he turned on his side and with the ques-
tion still begging an answer grumbled him-
bled himself off to sleep
for the flag



chapter xiv

  with the superintendent of police

in the morning before going down to
breakfast jimmy climbed the stairs to
the roof it was sheer inquisitiveness that
impelled him he hoped to find some evi-
dence of mrs isaacs visit to the spot

  he looked about him with the excep-
tion of odds and ends of old newspapers
the street tourbillions had sent wheeling up
through many weeks there was nothing on
the roof to excite comment he walked to
the north parapet and looked over the
plaza central was spread out before him
beyond in the distance were the govern-
ment buildings and the presidents man-
sion between these and the business sec-
tion of the city was a checkered map of
many-tinted dwellings

  jimmys gaze returned to the square at
his feet an automobile was stopping be-
fore the banco nacional he recognized
morales alighting from it and that was
miss taylor with him jimmy could not
mistake that erect elegant figure

  a busy day for you senor renegado
he muttered i wonder how you will get
that dispatch to kaufman you cant
telephone him for fear of somebody listen-
ing in you cant take it yourself and
i dont think youd risk trusting it to the
mails-not now a messenger perhaps
but not miss taylor that wouldnt do at
all

  the car drove off it drew up at the
post-office on the east side of the square
and miss taylor got out and went in
jimmy grinned derisively

  sending a story home to her magazine
maybe interview with the secretary of
state great stuff

  he was turning away when in the direc-
tion of the calle comercio he saw a thing
that arrested him it was the imperial
german standard fluttering up to the peak
of its tall staff he could see the man at
the halyards la caridad was striking the
hour

  nine oclock they are on the job early
there jimmy soliloquized we dont
take down our shutters billy said until
ten they are always on the job these
germans

  the little frowning knot popped out be-
tween his eyes as he stood surveying the
flag his thoughts returned to mrs isaacs

  i wonder if that had anything to do with
her trip up here  wonder if she sig-
naled-

  -ie broke off with a curt laugh at him-
self it was black night when mrs isaacs
made her visit to the roof

  jimmy suddenly crouched down behind
the parapet his eyes had lighted on a
small figure in gray crossing the plaza from
the east it was mrs isaacs he watched
her from his hiding-place she was at the
bandstand now here she stopped lin-
gered a moment and went on but with a
sharp turn to the north it would bring
her out at a point directly in face of the
banco nacional

  hello jimmy exclaimed she is going

there

  even as he voiced his surprise mrs
isaacs crossed the street and entered the
bank jimmy again mocked at himself

  what of it what did i go there for
what do hundreds thousands of people go
there for bah im making mountains
of molehills to the deuce with mrs
isaacs im going to get some breakfast

  on the point of leaving he cast another
glance at the post-office the morales car
was gone he swept the four sides of the
square for a sight of it but in vain where-
upon he retraced his steps to the hatch
before going in he looked off to the south
where the piled-up mountains drew a
blurred blue wave-line across the sky

  that highest peak must be borazo the
sleeping volcano from the top of which
winifred brewer had said the pacific could
be seen he could vision the girl as she
had stood beside him in the bungalow out-
side the old stone house it was a picture
he had summoned up more than once in the
past twenty-four hours and each time from
a new angle of discovered charm

  he went down the stairs and to his de-
layed breakfast subsequently he loitered
about the lobby impatient for enrique to
arrive and tell him that the guns were
ready he would start for the hacienda
immediately after keeping his appointment
with ortega at eleven it was past ten now

  a young man came in from the street and
spoke to the clerk jimmy happening to
look that way saw the amiable mr gomez
pointing him out the young man came
over to where he was standing bowed low
and tendered him an envelope monogramed
in gold


adventure

  tengo el honor de presentarle urn carta
del senor don manuel morales  he said
and bowed himself away

  jimmy thought of calling him back but
reflected that were an answer desired the
messenger would have waited he found
a chair sat down took out his penknife
and slit open the envelope whatever
senor morales proficiency in oral english
he evidently was not sure of himself with
the written word the note was in span-
ish jimmy made rather heavy weather
of it but finally mastered the contents
stripped of a maze of flowery superlatives
and reduced to bald terms he was informed
that senora morales was seriously ill and
the dinner invitation was recalled

  that dispatch of course he specu-
lated this is what ortega expected
his mouth widened humorously ive got
to eat four bananas and i hate the sight
of the darned things

  he sat on hoping for segovias appear-
ance was there any hitch about the guns
no there couldnt be he had the govern-
ments secret sanction at his back what
the dickens could be keeping him then

  at ten minutes of eleven jimmy aban-
doned hope of segovias coming he went
to the desk and asked for a sheet of paper

  you will find me with e o after
eleven he wrote

  he sealed the note and charged the clerk
to give it into segovias hands if he looked
in then he set out to keep his engagement
with ortega

he turned south from the plaza
into the calle central walked two
squares and came to a long ram-
bling structure pierced with an archway
that led into a great paved quadrangle at
the farther end yawned the mouth of the
municipal prison around the quadrangle
doors opened into various administrative
departments-the lower courts of law
mayors office city police and what not
also here was to be found the office of the
state superintendent of police the posi-
tion was in effect a cabinet one though it
was not so dignified in the zanhorian con-
stitution

  jimmy passed in under the arch he
knew his way thus far for it was here he had
come on monday night with enrique a
man whom he accosted conducted him to a
door to the left and into a waiting-room

here his name was taken in to an adjoining
room and almost instantly thereafter he
was ushered into this sancum the super-
intendent was standing at his desk to greet
him they shook hands

  i should have told you ortega said
of my private entrance from the street-
that he indicated a door at his back
it would have relieved you of this trouble
im afraid ive kept you waiting
jimmy apologized i was hoping to see
enrique segovia and hung on till the last
minute those guns you know

  ortega placed a chair for him and re-
sumed his seat

  did not senor segovia mention it to
you he asked i arranged with him
about it last night at supper the guns
went out early this morning in a cart-
four mausers and as many colts my man
was instructed to say that they were from
you

  oh said jimmy

  he was disappointed

  ortega gave him an exploring glance
jimmy felt his face grow red under it

  i expected to take them myself he
murmured its all right of course he
summoned a laugh and remarked i reckon
youd better send out for some bananas
im due to eat a few

  yes

  yes if my head wasnt stuffed with
wool i would have known that morales
would have other things to do tonight than
to give a dinner-party

  ortega idly scanned the note jimmy
passed to him and laid it down since he
was acquainted with the essence of it the
manner did not concern him

  i imagined you would hear from him
was his only comment

  i say senor superintendent exclaimed
jimmy as a sudden thought visited him
what if those two held a meeting last
night they cant let the grass grow under
them now

  the other shook his head

  if morales knew of kaufmans return
and that is not certain he would have had
difficulty in seeing him his excellency
arrived three hours late an accident the
locomotive blew out a cylinder head after
leaving yoro kaufman went directly to
his house in the calle rosario and to bed
i judge for he did not come out at mora-
les house there was but one caller last

for the flag



night-our afflicted young friend don en-
rique segovia

  jimmy bounced in his chair

  the deuce when he left me he said
he was going to bed

  the superintendent was silent for an ap-
preciable time he was leaning back gaz-
ing at a picture on the wall over the desk
jimmy wondered what was coming at
last ortega spoke

  sometimes when a man receives a hard
blow-on his head let us put it-he loses
his sense of perspective for a period then
if he is fortunate he gets another blow on
the same spot and is himself again in
the interim hes a trial to his friends

  i know who you have in mind said
jimmy bluntly but i think i gave him
an eye-opener last night

  he told of his talk with enrique of billy
smiths positive identification of mary tay-
lor and of his own conclusions regarding
her

  and it seems appended ortega quietly
that don enrique could not sleep until he
had seen the lady and assured himself of
her unblemished innocence let us pray
that his frenzy did not whip his tongue to
say things that we shall all regret

  great grief cried jimmy aghast he
wouldnt do a thing like that

  he is in love commented the official
dryly i think we will look for another
driver for your car tonight

  i have him submitted jimmy promptly
billy smith of the american legation and
he speaks german

  ortega was interested

  you can be sure of him he inquired
id trust that kid to hades and back
declared jimmy ill have him on hand
when you say so it is to be tonight

  he leaned forward eagerly

  yes moralesnote was the one proof
i needed kaufman will meet with him at
his house tonight at the usual hour i
assume he smiled our good friend
juan lopez has been of service there
lopez jimmy was puzzled

  i let him go home this morning con-
tinued ortega and it happened that
shortly afterward there was trouble with
the lighting system in senor morales house
marica juans woman discovered it there
is a cellar in which the kitchen stores are
kept it is dark marica found that the
lights would not burn investigation

proved that the entire house system was
affected the power company sent a man
to make repairs and we shall have installed
presently a detectaphone under the side- -

board in the dining-room-

  with the other end in the cellar cut
in jimmy his eyes aglow i get you
don emilio but if they dont use the
dining-room what then

  ortega spread out his palms

  it is a chance but lopez says they
have used it heretofore he has seen a
thread of light under the windows on those
other nights

  i suppose advanced jimmy diffidently
theres  danger of this fellow lopez
giving you the double-cross

  giving me the what

  don emilios english comprehensive
though it was failed him here

  go back on you turn traitor jimmy
explained

  he wont said the other with cold
emphasis we have an understanding
and he will answer for marica

it occurred here to jimmy
that it might be well to confide in
don emilio his suspicions of mrs
rebecca isaacs he did so the super-
intendent listened with tranquil composure
he said when jimmy was through

  if we are right about miss taylor it
would seem to preclude suspicion of this
mrs isaacs two german intelligence
people-and both women-working in one
small city is hardly probable i wont say
it is impossible-the term is obsolete-but
it is uneconomic a crime in german eyes
the womans mission may very well be
exactly as she has stated it

  but the visit to the roof-at two in the
morning argued jimmy unconvinced
that is what stops me

  if i had time i could evolve a dozen
reasons for it returned the other his
gray eyes twinkled when you have lived
to my age you will know that the thing you
least expect a woman to do is precisely the
thing she is most likely to do but we are
straying from our objective i will ask
you and mr smith to stay close to your
hotel after nine tonight keep to your
room i shall know then exactly where to
find you you will be sent for when the
time is at hand my special reason for ask-
ing you to come to me this morning has


adventure

been satisfied-the word from morales
have you a pistol

  i pack one in my grip answered
jimmy i wish he added i could have
a look at kaufman to size up his man-
power dont you think it likely that hell
show himself today at the international
just to make people think theres nothing
in the wind i can get mr lane to take
me there to lunch

  ortega nodded

  i think it is likely mr perry un-
less-

  oh i say don emilio just call me
jimmy ill be proud to have you youre
a mans man sir its good to know you

  the superintendent acknowledged this
gravely under the surface he was im-
mensely pleased for he liked this young
american

  to me the honor jimmy yes unless
he has a better reason i think it is likely
that herr kaufman will show himself at
the club today

  his last appearance grinned jimmy

  a little scraping sound caused him to
look toward the outer door he noticed
that there was a steel box attached to it

  the post said ortega he got up
fitted a key to the box and took out a letter
he returned to his desk and studied the
superscription a moment with an ex-
cusatory gesture he opened the missive
the news it conveyed was sensational but
his face gave no indication of it he looked
up at jimmy

  i will read you this he said it was
mailed this morning by the postmark
spanish and unsigned hand disguised
i should say

   he translated the note

   there is a secrct wireless plant at the german
legation watch the flagstaff after midnight

  mrs isaacs popped out jimmy

  but immediately his countenance fell
the warning did not fit in with his theory
of the woman for in spite of ortega he
believed she was a german spy

  the superintendent stroked his chin
softly he was deeply interested in this
intelligence he had received it was only
since juan lopezs revelation that he had
seriously connected kaufman with the plot
against the state he had not in the in-
terim turned his thoughts to the german le-
gation they were with kaufman at arraca

 ah he murmured i am beginning to
 understand they have a wireless at the
 lumber camp and the yacht mentioned
 in the washington dispatch has one-of

 course

   if it was not mrs isaacs who do you

 think sent the note jimmy asked some
 resident of cortina who has stumbled on
 the secret

   i am not thinking of the sender my
 good friend replied ortega it is the
 verification of this advice that i am con-
 cerned with afterward-

   some one tapped on the street door
 ortega quit the desk and consulted a win-
 dow mirror artfully placed to reflect through
 the jalousie any one who stood without

   it is enrique segovia he announced

   i left a line for him saying he could find
 me here jimmy told him

   ortega shrugged resignedly

  in that case-

   he did not finish but opened the door

   segovia strode in his face was flushed
 and his eyes were clouded with an expres-
 sion that was anger irritation despair and
 sullen defiance welded into a gloomy whole

chapter xv

making ready

 segovia exploded into rapid-fire span-
 ish the moment the door was closed
 it was a natural reversion to his native
 tongue in an hour of stress but he caught
 sight of jimmys bewildered face and
 changed to english

   i am just from my uncle he said
 savagely wejiave had words-a quar-
 rel he will not believe but stay i
 must tell you what went before

   he did not go on right away but walked
 nervously about the room ignoring the
 seat ortega indicated to him the super-
 intendent said nothing and waited sego-
 via suddenly stopped in front of jimmys
 chair

   you have told don emilio of our talk
 last night he taxed

   briefly yes jimmy answered steadily
 i thought that he should know

   he expected an outbreak of reproaches
 to his surprise segovia received the avowal
 with an appearance of relief

   that makes it easier he said and went
 on without pause i did not go home
for the flag



when i left you instead i called on miss
taylor and- his voice rose to a pitch of
triumph-and i learned from her lips
that all these imputations that have been
brought against her are absolutely without
foundation

  jimmy stared at him unbelieving of his
own ears the fellow had indeed gone
stark mad ortega made no sound

  i did not see my uncle at breakfast
segovia proceeded i overslept but i
went to his office he acknowledged to
me that he did not count the copies of
that dispatch when they were laid on his
desk-he did not have the opportunity
but the secretary claims that he made
three copies he swears that he did and
on this one mans word alone rests the
charge against a womans honor i say
that he is grossly in error or that he lies
he may be getting german money how
do you know that he isnt

  jimmy threw a startled look in the super-
intendents direction here was a possi-
bility they had not reckoned with the
man at the desk held his imperturbable
pose he knew valeras secretary jimmy
turned to segovia he was continuing his
story the angry blood boiling in his face

  i submitted to don luis the facts i had
learned he met them with total in-
credulity with insulting doubts of my
sanity with aspersions on miss taylors
character that were monstrous after what
she had told me he-

  jimmy caught him up with a burst of
exasperation in which alarm for their cause
was mingled

  in gods name man what did she tell
you he shouted

  what shouted back segovia that
she wanted to call on senor valera again
at once if possible to talk with him about
her work would that be the desire of
a thief oh i can see what you two are
thinking-that i played the fool-that i
brought up these charges one by one
and asked her to explain well i did noth-
ing of the sort i did not give her the
fraction of a hint that she was suspected
we talked of many things and my ques-
tions were slipped in here and there-
naturally-as well as don emilio could
have done it i wanted the truth-do you
understand i had to have it for if she
had been deceiving me all along i-

  his utterance choked and ceased all

the latent turbulency of the mans nature
was revealed in this one flashing instant
jimmy sought to restore him to himself

  go on he said in a cool even voice
how about that magazine-the name
of it

  ah segovia exhaled noisily it is
the north american gazelle published in
philadelphia an old-established periodical
of the highest order he laughed bitterly
my uncle desires to see her credentials-
a ladys word is not sufficient i shall be
asked next to make her prove that she
arrived here on monday from champerico
she told you that-that she came from
champerico

  she did

  go on said jimmy sententiously
what else is there to say retorted
segovia i have proved my points
smith was mistaken-all of you mistaken
you have traduced a perfectly irreproach-
able girl defenseless except for me
neither jimmy nor ortega spoke
segovia had resumed his caged pacing of
the room

  there is another thing he broke out
miss taylor has heard these revolution
rumors that are afloat she mentioned it
yesterday while we were out driving

  oh lord groaned jimmy

  i made light ofthem-denied them
segovia shot out fiercely do you think
i am a fool she knows nothing of this
kaufman business she knows only what
everybody knows you may form a dif-
ferent opinion of miss taylor after this

dinner tonight-

  the invitation is withdrawn put in
jimmy read this you will find its
counterpart no doubt waiting for you at
your house

  segovia read morales note chagrin
was written on his face

  the dona natalia was ill when i was
there last night he muttered

  in preparation for this of today ob-
served jimmy ironically miss taylor
never expected to see you tonight kauf-
man will be there

  segovia swore a wicked spanish oath
enough he cried i will hear no
more against her ha

  he thought he saw his way to over-
whelming them with the convincing proof
of their blind stupidity he came over to
where ortega sat


adventure

  miss taylor told me last night that
information had reached her of value to the
state she refused to tell me what it was
but said she would communicate it to the
superintendent of police if she does this
don emilio what shall you have to say
then shall you he sneered regard it as
an enemy act

 by george sir gasped jimmy at
ortega that note you just got i saw

her go into the post-office-

  he checked himself at a slight movement
from the superintendent but too late
segovia pounced upon his words

  ah you have heard from her senor
ortega now will you believe

  ortega turned to jimmy

  when he asked

  while i was on the roof it was striking
nine

ortega examined again the post-
mark of the envelope on his desk
the hour was  am as he
knew this was the time they began to make
up the mail for the second city delivery

  well am i not to see what miss taylor
wrote demanded segovia if others
have seen it i presume i may

  don emilio quietly handed him the
note

  why it is not signed he exclaimed
as you see don enrique yet per-
haps you are acquainted with the ladys
writing yes

  no confessed segovia i am not
acquainted with it

  then there is no certainty that it is from
miss taylor this information

  but she said it was of value to the state
and this is one can hardly call it a coin-
cidence argued segovia i shall find
out i shall ask her

  ortega put his hand out and touched the
fiery young fellows arm there was some-
thing placating something paternal in the
gesture

 tomorrow my boy he said we
will call judgment suspended until then
i am willing to make all amends if i have
suspected the lady unjustly but today-
tonight-i have work laid out for you
enrique i have selected you to put this
radio plant out of business kaufmans
people must not send that dispatch abroad
tonight

  jimmy admired the simple ease with

which the police head was disposing of a
difficulty

  but-if you are right-if kaufman
does go to morales-i am to drive the car
for jimmy protested segovia

  i have arranged for that ortega told
him this that i have for you to do is
vastly more important it requires proved
courage you are the man for it my
choice

  segovia was almost normal again and he
was flattered by the superintendents esti-
mate of him

  what am i to do he asked

   watch the flagstaff  ortega quoted
from the note that can mean but one
thing they raise a wireless antenna on
it some time after midnight the sending
apparatus is in the cellar of course and
you cant get at it but you can disable the
antenna you will be stationed on the
adjacent roof some one it is natural to
imagine will be on guard on the legation
roof you are to overpower that man and
cut the wire

  segovias eyes had kindled as he listened
mary taylor receded into the background
of has thoughts and a healthy reaction
followed it was the stimulus of adventure
flowing in his veins he spoke with
alacrity

  ill do better than that ill cut down
the flagpole he laughed now they
may complain to the police tomorrow don
emilio its an invasion of extra-territorial
rights

  they can not complain they are
operating a secret wireless in contravention
of the public law returned the superin-
tendent y will report to me here please
at half-past ten tonight for instructions

  jimmy felt that the interview so far as
he was concerned was at an end it was
nearly twelve and he remembered that the
negro sam brewers chauffeur would be
at the post-office at twelve he would send
a word to winifred by sam

  i think i will be going don emilio
he said i have taken up enough of your
time

  and i i will be going too unless you
have something more to say to me
segovia added

  ortega rose

  nothing more this morning just keep
alive until tonight he smiled go out
the way you came jimmy if you please
for the flag



it will excite less remark than if you both
leave by the same door should any one be
passing

  as jimmy a few minutes later issued
from the archway into the calle central
he looked about for enrique he glimpsed
him going down the street away from the
plaza jimmy drew a breath of relief
he had felt there in ortegas office a sense
of constraint with enrique and that the
feeling was mutual enriques present action
evinced he had not waited for him
jimmy was sorry that this cloud had arisen
between them for he liked the young
zanhorian whole-heartedly

  oh well it wont last he reflected
when enrique gets over this mary taylor
fever hell be worth while again his
brow wrinkled as another view of the situ-
ation obtruded itself suppose after all
he should be right about her-where would
i get off at the wrong stop by jove
confound women anyway

  with this sage conclusion he hurried on
to send a message to winifred it had been
his intention to drop into the hotel and
scribble a few lines advising her that the
attempt was for this night but he aban-
doned it the noon hour was booming out
and he was afraid that sam might not wait
the prescribed fifteen minutes

  he came to the square and cut across it
to the post-office sam was already on
hand and jimmy noted with approval
that he had placed his car some little way
down from the office before a house-renting
agency he gathered from the sign in the
window jimmy felt that he would not be
quite such a conspicuous target for the
curious eyes of those going in and out of
the public building when he spoke to sam
it would be but a word for he knew from
much experience with negroes their inability
to carry straight a verbal message

  jimmy lounged indifferently up to the car
he saw that the tonneau was piled with
packages and boxes things to eat he sur-
mised the delivery of the guns had
perhaps prompted brewer to lay in stores
against possible eventualities within
touch of sams elbow jimmy stopped and
maneuvered to light a cigaret he spoke
to the man under his breath

  sam i am mr james perry sit still

  yessuh

  the black remained quiescent as a block
of ebony jimmy continued

  say to miss winifred this lookforme
late tonight 

   look for me late tonight  repeated
sam

  good you have earned five dollars
jimmy said and walked on drawing  his

cigaret

  something-the nudging of a sixth sense
it might have been-impelled him to glance
behind him sam was starting off stand-
ing in the door of the renting-agency was
mrs isaacs the machine moved away
and she came on jimmy hastily turned to
front again

  where did she spring from he asked
himself irritably it will be getting so
pretty soon that ill be seeing her in my
sleep i wonder if she caught on to it that

i	was talking with sam i wonder-great
guns-if she was taking in the number
of the car he laughed shortly oh
bosh im a regular old maid ill be look-
ing under the bed for burglars next

  nevertheless he did not go directly up
the calle commercio to his legation as he
had intended but stopped in at a tobacco
shop on the corner here he spent ten
minutes selecting a box of cigars it helped
him to dodge mrs isaacs and besides he
would want something to smoke at the
hacienda

jimmy received a distinct shock
as he approached the legation
morales car stood in front of it and
the hon john henry lane bareheaded
was escorting out to it no other than miss
mary taylor jimmy was still some dis-
tance down the street and he slipped into a
doorway to recover from this midriff thrust
at his suspicions of the girl

  ill be shot if this dont get my goat
he inelegantly remarked

  he heard presently the grunt of the
mechanism as the clutch was let in and
he recollected that the car was pointed his
way as he was not of a mind to be de-
tected skulking in a doorway he stepped
forth and proceeded leisurely up the street

  miss taylors quick eye singled him out
she spoke to her driver and the car slid up
to the walk precisely at the point that
would intercept jimmy

  how do you do mr perry she called
out to him

  he paused apparently surprised and de-
lighted


adventure

  why how do you do he returned
im beginning to believe that i wa bom
to good luck this is the second time i
have had the happiness of seeing you
today

  she widened her wonderful eyes at him
  indeed and the first time

  you were going into the post-office
and you wouldnt stop and speak
oh i was too far oil and i was late
for my breakfast

  that she said with a radiant smile
is the cleverest excuse you could offer

	is so entirely satisfying if i had robbed
you of your breakfast what would you have
thought when you learned that i was also
to deny you your dinner-or that senor
morales was viene  ser lo mismo you
have his apologies-yes poor dona na-
talia she is really wretchedly indisposed
please convey to her my sympathy and
to senor morales jimmy entreated with
becoming concern for myself i have
lost beyond recall a pleasure that senor
morales kindly intimated was simply de-
ferred i am leaving cortina very shortly
her face expressed polite regret

  you are going away for good

  or ill-one never knows

  you mean that you are going home to
fight the germans i suppose
eventually if not now just at this
moment i am on my way to a luncheon
appointment with the american minister
he grinned at least i am reasonably
sure of that one meal i have it here

  he touched the package under his arm
  she laughed in real amusement

  mr lane she exclaimed i am just
from him i came down on some errands
dona natalia forgot to mention to me this
morning we chanced to pass through this
street and i saw the flag-old glory
she clasped her hands as might a saint at
prayer i just had to go in and register
and mr lane such a charming man
so-so- her eyes were ecstatic-beauti-
fully impressed with the responsibilities of
his eminent post i adore him

  hang it shes making fun of him thought
jimmy ill risk a shot at her he said
you found the key to his weak spot
i perceive yet really lane isnt such an
ass as he seems-he can see through a mill-
stone with a hole in it as well as the next
one especially if theres a pretty woman
at the far end but im keeping you

he held out his hand enrique has told
me of his call on you last night he imag-
ined he felt her fingers flex slightly poor
chap you have bewitched him and he
doesnt know it or might it be proper to
say lucky chap of one who is under a
spell he laughed good-naturedly and
rattled on i wont say good-by its
bad medicine ill say-how is it in
german-auf wiedersehn anyway i
mean i shall exist only in the hope of seeing
you again

  she bit her lip for he had bowed and
moved away before she could frame an
adequate rejoinder she bade the driver
go on and leaned back with a delicate
frown penciled between her sea-blue eyes

  the car was turning into the calle
grande on the north side of the plaza when
the driver brought it to a stop at an earnest
signal from a little woman in gray who was
standing just around the corner

  what is it gaspar inquired miss
taylor

  the drivers answer was forestalled by the
appearance of the little woman at the door
of the machine

  how do you do miss taylor she
smiled in a quick undertone she added
something that caused miss taylor to
accept the extended hand to passers-by
here were two friends pleasantly met
gaspar at the wheel cocked his ear hoping
to hear what was said but the voices were
pitched too low for him and in a language
he did not understand

  the two talked in rapid questioning
sentences for a brief period then fol-
lowed another exchange of handshakes
and mrs isaacs stepped down from the
running-board at a word from miss
taylor the car continued on its way her
face was thoughtful

  mrs isaacs crossed over to the renting-
agency below the post-office in ten min-
utes she was out again on the street she
waved back the man who had accompanied
her to the door he expostulated defer-
ence in all his manner but her negation was
positive and with a shrug and a bow he
returned inside these americans one
knew not what to expect of them they
would walk in the heat of the day to inspect
a residence when an automobile was at their
disposal madre de dios

  mrs isaacs walked sedately south on the
calle commercio until she came to the
for the flag



caue dolores a dozen blocks from the
piaza she turned west on this and began
to scrutinize the houses closely they
were detached each in its own plat of
ground finally she paused at no 
drew a key from her pocket and let herself
in it was the furnished house walter
brewer had so hurriedly departed from on
tuesday moming

  it would appear that mrs isaacs search
for her lost relative was taking on curious
angles of endeavor

chapter xvi

in aid of the cause

tilly smith looked up with a broad
grin when jimmy entered the legation
got news for you sport he cried

  no you havent jimmy countered
ive been speaking with her down the
street saw her coming out of here

  its my panama pet declared billy
emphatically if it isnt its her twin
sister gee his nibs fell for her hard
listen you can hear the echo yet

  shut up jimmy barked at him
bring out the visitors book i want a
peek at it

  shes in it all right billy assured him
miss mary w taylor minneapolis min-
nesota i guided her dear little hand oh
boy aint she a dream the kind they
rob the banks for

  while he was chattering his nonsense
billy had produced the register jimmy
studied the entry

  darn it all he mumbled i wish i had
that note this looks something like it-
the w in watch the flagstaff but
ortega said the writing was disguised im
up a stump

  he banged the book shut impatiently
whats the excitement inquired billy
who was scanning him expectantly

  got an american newspaper directory
in the archives of this mausoleum de-
manded jimmy

  an old one

  get it out-not now but while im in
with lane-and see if theres a magazine
published in philadelphia called the north
american gazette

 what the-

  and say sonny you ought to be home
in bed youve got a fever coming on

your eyes are not right ill mention it to
lane a complete rest is what you need
three days longer maybe

  aha billys nose twitched violently
you havent forgotten your promise
you are going to let me hefp

  jimmy nodded

  tonight do you know the fernandez
hacienda on the santa marta road

  like the way to dinner been by it a
million times

  all right get some sleep and come to
the hotel at nine sharp-my room wear a
cap do you own a pistol

  you bet an automatic

  billys voice changed to a feeble moan
and he dropped limply into a chair he
had heard a hand on the door of the next
room it was mr whittaker the secre-
tary coming in

  smith he began morosely but at sight
of jimmy he broke into glad acclaim its
mr perrv how are you sir you have
called to see the minister he will be
delighted he turned irritably on billy
in heavens name smith what has over-
taken you what are you making those
horrid sounds for

  hes not well put in jimmy i re-
marked it when i came in a touch of
fever i should say

  mr whittaker gazed through his spec-
tacles in acute astonishment at his assistant
not twenty minutes before in the presence
of the departing miss taylor he had been
as vivacious as a monkey

  im feeling awful bad whimpered
billy it struck me all of a sudden

  go home and to bed young fellow
call a doctor jimmy gave whittaker a
friendly tap on the shoulder you ought
to let him have a few days off an ounce
of prevention-what

  the pale-faced secretary tingled with
pleasure at the plutocratic touch

  certainly smith certainly he
sparkled stay till monday ill look
after your end dont worry shall we go
in to the minister mr perry

  billy cautiously recovering stared at the
door that closed on them

  huh talk about love making the world
go round he gibed its grease the
kind jimmys got in barrelfuls i wish i
was good and plenty smeared with it

  he left his chair and hurriedly consulted
the newspaper directory he did not want


adventure

whittaker to come back and question him
he made a mental note of his finding
grabbed for his hat and scampered to the
door he pulled up as he reached it

  gosh he exclaimed i forgot to
tell jimmy that mrs ikey was here this
morning and slipped away without regis-
tering hell get it first from the old man
now

  he went out grumbling at himself for
overlooking this extra morsel of legation
news

  jimmy found the portly envoy in excel-
lent spirits good humor played upon his
brow and peeped from his eye

  ah james my dear boy how are you
today he caroled i was rather expect-
ing you to drop in and talk over the pro-
cedure of last night a little sooner james
and i could have given you a surprise

  he rubbed his hands and wagged his
head with ponderous cunning

  a surprise said jimmy innocently
what sir

  a lady my boy one in whom we are
all deeply interested

  not miss taylor

  herself james and egad sir i cant
bring myself to blame senor segovia for
his flair in that direction a beautiful
woman captivating as grateful to the
eye as a-ah-ahumph-young gazelle
great scott he certainly did fall for
her ejaculated jimmy inwardly aloud
he said you have surprised me sir
this i would have imagined is the last
place miss taylor would have ventured in
a remarkable woman james it was
a treat to visit with her gabbled lane
it removed the last doubt i entertained
of her would a person who had stolen a
state secret come to the-er-ahumph-
nest so to speak in which it was hatched
no certainly not would the accredited
correspondent of the-whats the maga-
zine

  philadelphia north american gazette
she says

  oh yes to be sure lane scribbled
on a pad before him i know it would
the correspondent of that pre-eminent
periodical be guilty of-ah-latrociny shall
we call it most assuredly not

  jimmy stared at him first enrique
now lane could it really be that he was in
the wrong and ortega-was he too as
badly misled as he thought back on it

ortega had seemed to waver in the last few
minutes of his talk with enrique this
morning

  look here mr lane he blurted out
im beginning to think that dispatch
wasnt stolen at all theres a mistake
somewhere enrique segovia claims that
it lies with senor valeras secretary there
is no one else to lay it to if we eliminate
miss taylor unless of course it happened
that senor valera chewed the paper up and
swallowed it in a fit of absent-mindedness
he laughed but without mirth

  lanevas silent he was leaning back
and twiddling his thumbs and smiling so
it seemed to jimmy at his own senile
imaginings of his late fair visitor

  i say mr lane he persevered
morales has recalled his dinner invitation
senor ortega says it means that kaufman
is going there tonight and its my chance
to get him but if the dispatch was not
stolen what reason have we to believe that
there will be a meeting tonight instead of
sunday the situation is beyond me
lane still smiling tapped his temple with
a long white finger and spoke his answer
was so astonisliingly at variance with the
question asked that jimmy gaped at him

  she has brains sir as well as beauty
it is why she came-the act of unconscious
innocence walking on the edge of the mine
without fear of harm no one but a beauti-
ful woman with brains would dare the thing
that might destroy her

  jimmy was sensible of the contradiction
of the ministers words and a variety of
expressions succeeded one another on his
face but he said nothing lane was not
through he saw

i enjoyed it immensely her
call lane continued i am still
enjoying it she approached me on
my blind side-oh it was rarely done as
sweetly as a child at play with its doll
i am letting you see james as i have no
doubt you have already seen that john
henry lane is a poor fool for vanity and
delights in incense burned at his feet of
clay it is only in a moment such as this
that i will confess my weakness-when
i have been properly made aware of it
oh why should the spirit of mortal be
proud when teetoodledum teetoodledow-
or however it goes perhaps you can sup-
ply it james but no matter i did
for the flag



heaven help me bathe in that lovely
creatures homage-and she went away in
the moral certainty that i had not the
remotest suspicion of her object in coming
the hon john henry sat up in his chair
and chuckled at the sport he had been
having with his young friend jimmy
heaved a huge sigh of restored confidence
in his own judgment

  you had me going sir i didnt know
where you were coming out he acknowl-
edged with a grin then you do believe
that miss taylor stole the paper

  did i not say that her call removed the
last doubt replied the minister his eyes
twinkling he turned serious james it
has helped our-er-your plans if im not
in error the woman thinks now that the
copy has not been missed and they will
proceed in this assurance you can depend
on it that herr kaufman has the dispatch
in his possession and will act quickly in

fact i can say-

  jimmy waited for him to go on but lane
seemed to have become absorbed in a
search for his box of cigars it was not in
the usual drawer he found it shortly

  help yourself james he invited i
need something for my nerves after what
i have been through this morning

  his eyes were twinkling again

  by the way sir jimmy said when they
had lighted up another woman has come
to own who has got me guessing a little
shes at the europa registered as mrs
rebecca isaacs of new york

  lane glanced at him and puffed out a
cloud of smoke he said negligently

  mrs isaacs oh yes ive had a call
from her shes in trouble hunting for
a friend i was sorry but i could see no
way to aid her what has she done to
occasion remark this mrs isaacs she
appeared to be an inoffensive little soul
jimmy related the series of incidents
that had come under his notice as he did
he realized how trivial they really seemed

  it does sound rather silly sir he con-
fessed if it wasnt for that roof business
i dont suppose id have given her a second
thought that looked a little queer to me
lane nodded but offered no comment
jimmy drew on his cigar a while

  hang it he volleyed out all at once
im stumped again he informed lane
rapidly of the anonymous note to ortega
and enriques belief that mary taylor

had sent it if she did he concluded
we are wrong about the dispatch she
wouldnt help kaufman with one hand
and strike him with the other its not in

reason

no said lane laconically it isnt
he did not appear to be greatly surprised
at the news of the wireless possibly because
he had come to suspect kaufman of some
secret means of communication with arraca

  well decided jimmy im not going
to bother my head about it any longer
what i came for principally sir was to
ask you to renew that luncheon invitation
of the other day i want a sight of kauf-
man before i come to grips with him
the lunch-most assuredly my boy
but herr kaufman-i have heard that he is
confined to his room with a bad cold the
result of his trip

  jimmy stared at him

  why then perhaps he wont come out
tonight he cried disappointedly

  perhaps lane smiled it is to conceal
his activities this dispatch means work
for him his wireless james will be busy
tonight

  maybe it wont declared jimmy
much relieved segovia is going to attend
to that and that brings me to a favor
i wish to ask segovia was to drive my car
as he is assigned to other work i want to use
billy smith i may want to use him for
several days

  the american minister threw up both
hands his face was a picture of con-
sternation

  impossible he gasped we are on
neutral ground the acts of a pleni-
potentiary are the acts of the nation he

represents it would be-

  jimmy impolitely cut him short

  oh i say mr lane with kaufman
planning to violate zanhorias neutrality
and compel the united states to intervene
weve a right to checkmate him its a
duty by jove

  yes yes but to give open aid-

  call it secret aid then interrupted
jimmy again president hurango is giv-
ing it and so can you anyway billy smith
is gone hes sick i told him he was
and mr whittaker sent him home he
wont be around till monday and you
neednt know what hes doing hi the mean-
time

  the harassed envoy had risen and was


adventure

striding about the room in a stew of per-
plexity but it was subsiding he could
see his way out he brought up at the
desk as jimmy finished and said with a
severity hiseyes belied

 smith is discharged-ah-ahumph-
resigned i should say it dates from this
morning he is no longer connected with the
legation it isnot responsible for his acts
jimmy drew down his mouth in a lugu-
brious grimace

  i am pained to hear it he murmured
mr smith impressed me as a young man
with a future in the diplomatic service
shall we go to lunch sir i think i could
circumvent a tortilla con camerones

  you everlasting young rascal sput-
tered the minister you have ruined my
appetite with this scrape you are leading
me into but come on i hope your
omelette will choke you

  the laugh that had been bubbling under
the surface brimmed over with this dire
invocation and the hon john henry
gave way to it jimmy joined in and upon
this scene of mirth the pale face of mr
whittaker looked in

  a cable sir-personal he announced
ah-ahumph the minister grasped
at the tatered ends of his official dignity
and drew them about him thank you
whittaker and-er-whittaker mr
smith has resigned from the staff he is
no longer with us

  the secretary gulped this news was
near to strangling him

  s-sir he stuttered why i-do i

understand-

 you do he has resigned make an
entry in the records to that effect please
the minister waved him away and took
his seat at the desk to decode the message
jimmy watched him he raised his head
presently and wagged it at him solemnly

  my boy he said your uncle must
have done tlus its the quickest thing
ive ever known

  what is asked jimmy mystified
the gunboat lincoln lieutenant norris
is ordered from colon to puerto mono
and it was only tuesday that i cabled the
request it-why damme james its as-
tonishing i didnt look for action under
a week at the soonest

  jimmy snickered at his thunderstruck
expression he couldnt help it

  i reckon its the war sir not uncle

allan theyll be cutting lots of red tape
up there in washington before we get
through with these germans so whats
the use in wrapping ourselves up with it
down here

  that said lane quickly is an
altogether different matter those shears
they use can clip off heads as well as tape
and im not anxious to see mine rolling in
the basket no ive given you smith
make the best of him it is all you will
get out of me james

  jimmys teeth showed in a joyous grin

  not quite all your excellency-unless
you are going to renege on that lunch he
remarked

billy smith like a good soldier
followed instructions to the letter
nine oclock was striking when he
knocked on jimmys door but all the
afternoon he had been burning up not
with fever but with a consuming curiosity
to know what the project was for which
he had been drafted

  he found jimmy sitting by the window
smoking a cigar and looking out on the
lighted plaza and the people taking the
cooling air the room was dark except for
such illumination as came from the hall
transom and from the square below

  jimmy smiled at the picture that pre-
sented itself

  poor lane she must have bored him
horribly

  he had his compensation later giggled
billy peaches and cream oh boy
they talked on for a while gradually
running down until finally they lapsed into
a hushed companionship of waiting ten
oclock had rung out from la caridad long
since now it struck eleven billy re-
marked on it lazily

  sounds like some big old buoy bell

  a correlation of ideas brought to jimmys
mind a thing he had forgotten to mention
to billy he said

 the trail at landry 

ty ncvil ghenskw

author of the killer the kid and the bad man for france etc

i   iftts is an age of wholesale con-
i  i  i version in the cities of the
i east and west noted evan-
  gelists herd thousands into has-
tily constructed tabernacles and by dint
of fiery words and still more fiery gestures
invoke their religious zeal thus when the
blaze of fervor burns its fiercest an end is
accomplished-an end involving an open
profession of faith sealed by means of a
handclasp with no less a person than the
evangelist himself this in the present
jargon inevitable to all movements of mag-
nitude is known as hitting the trail

  in the french or cajun parishes of
southwestern louisiana noted evangelists
are unknown there the people are for the
most part of one creed so that the congre-
gations of the various curts form a fairly
complete census of the population yet
even here certain spiritual slackers turn a
deaf ear to the voice of duty causing the
good fathers to labor mightily in their
effort to set these wayward feet upon the
trail

   all of which brings us finally to the affair
of old man polyte greig

i

it was the feast of all saints
and in the words of landry folk
old man polyte was at it again
he stood upon the porch of the coffee-
house his body flattened out against one
of the broad supporting pillars his right
arm rising at regular intervals to the ac-
companying kick and crash of his ancient

heavy revolver outside in the live-oak
grove that shaded the village square the
varo brothers wove their ponies in and
out of the protecting tree-trunks as they
pumped their answering shots into the
echoing emptiness of the coffee-house porch

  inside the bar such unfortunate patrons
as had been cut off from an escape to the
rear crouched low in their comers voicing
a general complaint that old man polyte
should have chosen the pillar in line with
the open front door and from behind the
bar itself came a wail of anguish as savoy
the proprietor hearkened to the havoc
wrought by stray bullets amid his carefully
arranged bottles and glassware

  the origin of the trouble dated back some
two years before then there had been
three varo brothers paul jules and bebe
following a quarrel between old man polyte
and paul the number had been reduced to
two this should have ended the affair
especially as the grand jury in the near-by
city of mouton had returned a verdict of
self-defense in old man polytes favor

  the remaining varos however had been
dissatisfied with this verdict hence there
had developed a species of guerilla warfare
involving numerous pitched battles each
of them staged at landry also since your
cajun dearly loves a fight there had been
no attempt at interference

they were something to look forward to
these clashes that occurred whenever the
varos rode in for a feast-day there was a
quality of unexpectedness about them that
was fascinating the varos chose no par-
ticular time for their onslaughts it might
the trail at landry



be morning or noon or the edge of twilight
when a thudding of hoofs and a shouting
of profane challenges would announce their
arrival then old man polyte would arise
from his interminable euchre to bang away
with his venerable colt until such time as
the varos chose to take their departure

  now whereas these combats might ap-
pear to possess a certain inequality in point
of numbers this inequality was made up
for by the mode of attack for if old man
polyte fought one man against two he also
fought on his feet with his weapon at rest
while his opponents sought such meager
results as could be obtained from the backs
of their wildly cavorting ponies indeed
if there existed an advantage this advan-
tage was probably on the side of old man
polyte at all events it was considered
fair fight at landry which was enough

  thanks to this method of warfare the
combatants had thus far emerged un-
scathed or at most with trifling wounds
it was held however that such a condition
could not prevail forever sooner or later
a serious injury or even a death would
occur invoking the law at mouton

  accordingly the present affair was fol-
lowed with especial interest by such of the
inhabitants and visitors as were in the
rear or safely out of range they watched
with the intent yet pensive air of folk who
await the curtain upon some well-known
and long-cherished drama

  for a time the conflict ran true to form
shouting whipping firing the varos dodged
about the grove amid the frenzied shying
and bridle-snapping of the various teams
that were hitched about them from his
stronghold old man polyte replied delib-
erately and mechanically as one who per-
forms an oft-repeated public duty nor
did he so much as flinch when an occasional
well-aimed shot smacked into the pillar
before him they built well at landry
and inside the hollow square was a sup-
porting round of solid cypress

  the watchers observing this well-ordered
procedure took heart of grace perhaps
after all the next feast-day would not lack
its usual excitement

  it was precisely at this moment that the
long-dreaded catastrophe occurred who
fired the shot whether jules or bebe varo
was never determined it was only known
that the bullet struck an edge of the pillar
and then by some abominable freak of luck

  glanced off and around to enter the body
of its lone defender

  with a grunt of pain old man polyte
dropped his weapon and swung out to the
edge of the porch here he stood for a
moment fumbling at his chest his expres-
sion changing trom vague uncertainty to
startled realization

  behold i am killed he announced
thickly

  then all of a sudden he collapsed
plumping over in a heap upon the ground

  as for the varos so great was their sur-
prise that they would have proven easy
prey for any who might have wished to
apprehend them but there was no estab-
lished law at landry and so having re-
covered themselves the brothers wheeled
about and loped rapidly out of town

ii

all this time pere martain the
cure of landry had been looking
on from his churchyard beyond the
live-oak grove he was a small man very
old and fragile yet in his pale quiet eyes
there shone a light of unconquerable cour-
age and determination with the departure
of the varos and the surging forward of the
crowd he too hurried across the square

  at the coffee-house he found all in con-
fusion men hurried this way and that
calling for a doctor a priest while others
realizing the gravity of the affair set out
to inform the authorities at mouton push-
ing his way through the excited throng
upon the porch pere martain entered the
bar and bent over the wounded man

  at sight of him old man polyte moved
uneasily

  that is all right mon pere said he in
a low stubborn voice i will go as i
have lived i am not one for a death-bed
conversion

the priest made a gesture of impatience

  do not be ridiculous hippolyte he
reproved i am here firstto inquire into
the seriousness of your wound when that
is determined it will be time to speak of
death-bed conversions

  again pere martain bent to his task
while the crowd looked on with respectful
attention he knew something of wounds
this little priest who had been chaplain of
vigilantes during the bitter days of the
reconstruction until the doctor arrived


adventure

and most probably afterward his verdict
would be accepted as final

  it is only the shoulder and high up at
that ilippolyte he now announced
thus you are denied your desire for an
impenitent end

  having made his point pere martain
did not linger at once he departed out-
side where there closed in upon him cer-
tain of the inhabitants who sought to
prolong the fast-waning excitement by re-
counting the affair to each unfortunate who
happened along thus pere martain was
forced to submit himself to a personally
conducted tour of the scene which began
at the exact spot occupied by old man
polyte behind the pillar and ended with
the depression made by his fallen body
amid the rank grass at the edge of the
porch

  it was while exhibiting this depression
that prejean the baker made a discovery
catching a metallic glint beneath one of
the grass tufts he drew forth a small flat-
tish object which he held up between a
thumb and forefinger

  see it is polytes saint he exclaimed
evidently it fell from his pocket when
they were carrying him inside

  at this pere martain exhibited an inter-
est that had been wholly lacking before
taking the object he discovered it to be
a small metal case which when handled
gave forth a faint rattling sound next
opening the case pere martain up-ended
it and dumped into his palm a leaden image
the image was squat and heavy and its
features suggested a grotesque and impish
mirth

  so mused pere martain then this
is hippolytes saint you are quite sure
absolutely replied prejean it goes
with him all the time

  then said the priest as he turned
away this is a matter in which i may well
take a hand

  that night pere martain got the image
and studied it long and carefully by the
light of his lamp being more or less of
an authority upon saints he entertained no
illusion from the first yet he felt that here
was an affair in which he must not trust
entirely to his own judgment all along
he had struggled with the impiety of old
man polyte and such a thing as a possible
advantage was not to be treated lightly

  in the end pere martain determined that

he would take the image to mouton there
he would show it to his friend monsieur
decourt in his position of notary mon-
sieur decourt was supposed to know every-
thing that was worth knowing at all

ill

four days later pere martain
pocketed the image and set out for
the dilapidated hut that old man
polyte occupied upon the edge of the vil-
lage as he trudged along the good priest
considered how best he might make use
of his discovery for years he had striven
with this particular sinner only to abandon
him as hopeless now it appeared that
there might be some chance for his redemp-
tion

  a man who carried about a saint could
not be wholly without belief inside him
must glow some spark of faith which if
properly fanned would kindle the fires of
devotion

  thus pere martain argued with himself
but as he did so he remembered that old
man polyte was a master of craft of subtle
evasion if given a chance he would be
quick to smother this spark of belief beneath
the ashes of deceit he must be ap-
proached warily and with an abruptness
that would defeat his powers of evasion
a victory could be accomplished only
through the element of surprise

  as he had expected pere martain found
the wounded man well upon the road to
recovery indeed he was already propped
up in the narrow bunk that was nailed to
one side of his small stuffy room his
greetings over pere martain seated  him-
self upon an empty box that did duty as a
chair

  well hippolyte he began and so
you have not made your expected go after
all

the sufferer grinned a trifle shamefacedly

  all the same it is no fun this getting
a bullet in ones body he replied at
first it is like the end of everything

  yet believing this you refused salva-
tion said the priest sternly hippolyte
i am ashamed of you even though you
care nothing for your own soul you should
at least consider the example you set to
those about you

the listener squirmed uncomfortably
while a dull harrassed look came into his
the trail at landry



eyes evidently he was intensely bored

  what is the use of going over all that
again mon phre he complained as
i have told you many times i would be-
lieve if i could since i can not there is
nothing more to say

  bien agreed the priest if you can
not believe if you can tell me truthfully
that you have no spark of faith however
small there is indeed nothing more to say
i have already said it returned old
man polyte for the rest how would it
profit me to lie to you

  pere martains moment had come he
was very sincere yet he could not resist a
dramatic flourish as he drew forth and
held out the image

  then what have you to say to this
he demanded

  to his surprise old man polyte betrayed
no consternation rather his expression was
one of relief while in his eyes shone an un-
doubted light of recognition

  my saint he exclaimed i knew
that sooner or later it would come to
hght

  then-then you admit that it is yours
questioned pere martain uncertainly

  and why not since i have carried it
ever since my wife gave it to me coun-
tered old man polyte it was this way
my old woman bought the saint at the
fair at mouton and always she treasured
it for the man told her that with it would
come good fortune when she was dying
she passed it on to me take it polyte
even though you have no faith she said
carry it about with you and it will keep
you from harm it was a little thing and
i have obeyed her wish that is all

  pere martain sighed resignedly he
saw that for this once at least the other
spoke the truth the mystery was ex-
plained there had been no spark after all

  so hippolyte said he i under-
stand also i commend you for thus re-
membering your dead wife perhaps as
she said the image will keep you from
harm he paused and added hopefully-
perhaps it has done so already

  old man polyte shrugged he now spoke
as one sure of himself

  my old woman was like that he re-
plied as for me i can only judge by
what has occurred in that last fight
my saint was with me all the time yet here
i am struck down by a bullet

  and what of those other fights ques-
tioned pere martain

  old man polyte shook his head

  it is this way said he a thing
works or it does not work as you see
the saint has not worked if ever it does
i promise that you will hear from me

 pere martain rose at once coming
from old man polyte this was all that
could be expected

  it is a bargain hippolyte said he
quickly when the time comes i will
hold you to it wait and you will see

  thereupon pere martain departed in a
state of mind not altogether unhopeful
he had great faith and despite his faults
old man polyte was always as good as his
given word

iv

rorji in six days more old man polyte
jjll was up and about his affairs as

      for these affairs had they been
separated into two grand divisions these
would have comprised pot-hunting and
euchre when in need of money old man
polyte slaughtered the ducks that infested
the lake near landry at other times he
might be found at the second of the three
card-tables in savoys coffee-house

  upon returning to the life of the village
old man polyte made a most pleasing dis-
covery he found that during the brief
space of his confinement he had become
a sort of hero yet this rise in the esteem
of his fellow men appeared to be due less
to his personal achievements than to the
events consequent upon them

  thanks to the supposed gravity of his
wound the law had appeared at landry
the sfieriff had ridden out to arrest the
varos afterward there had been an in-
vestigation during one whole day offi-
cers had galloped about creating an excite-
ment that would be spoken of for months
to come in brief landry had been put
upon the map of the parish and as all
agreed old man polyte had put it
there

  be it said of old man polyte that he made
the most of his opportunity where another
would have boasted his way into speedy
disfavor he preserved a most gratifying
and profitable silence upon being ques-
tioned as to his now historic behold i
am killed he merely shrugged as one who
would say that is my affair


adventure

  following which the inhabitants attrib-
uted to him a most amazing foresight

  he is a keen one that polyte they
said whether he imagined himself killed
or not he saw and grasped the opportunity
that has made us prominent

  after this old man polytes position was
secure finding both friends and credit at
the coffee-house he established himself
permanently at the second of the two card-
tables leaving the ducks to fly unmolested
above the marshes of the lake it was a
period of peace for the former hunter a
period unmarred by any bothersome de-
tails of finance

  if he won at his euchre he was that much
ahead if he lost he merely gave his
friends a chance to further expound the
beauties of civic gratitude as for the
drinks-just now old man polytes pres-
ence meant business so long as this con-
dition prevailed savoy would continue to
serve them

  yet for all this old man polyte was not
long in finding the inevitable fly in the oint-
ment of his content or rather it was two
flies personified by the brothers varo

  following old man polytes recovery the
authorities had dealt promptly with the
varos also they had dealt severely per-
haps the authorities felt that they had been
tricked into making a great deal of fuss
over a very ordinary brawl perhaps they
were simply wearied by the continued law-
lessness at landry be this as it may they
sentenced the varos to six months work
upon the public roads

  now to the varos this sentence was un-
supportable far more would they have
preferred the penitentiary or even the gal-
lows in that event their punishment
would have partaken of the heroic to
their friends they would have appeared as
martyrs

  but six months of shoveling ahead of a
ball and chain it was as ridiculous as it
was disgraceful they had shot a man
and they were treated like chicken-thieves

  yet strangely enough the varos bore no
resentment against those responsible for
their degradation they placed the blame
wholly upon the aged shoulders of old man
polyte it was all his fault they declared
he should have died as he said he would
or at least have made a poor recovery
then they would have been punished in a
manner befitting their endeavors

  but thanks to a merciful providence
the matter was not past mending as old man
polyte should presently learn they would
get him the moment they were out again

  all of which being duly reported at lan-
dry caused old man polyte to enter upon a
period of uncomfortable reflection how-
ever he consoled himself with the thought
that six months was a long time and that
the game of getting was one at which
three could play as well as two

  so the days slipped by while the ancient
sinner prospered a worse example than
ever before so pere martain waited grip-
ping hard to his faith assuring himself that
in the event of success his victory must
now be all the greater so the public
gratitude grew worn and threadbare as if
given time public gratitude always will

  then one day when old man polyte sat
down to his euchre the end arrived

  one moment polyte said the others
at the table have you any money
otherwise there is no place for you already
you owe us more than we can afford

  a little later upon the demand of a
drink savoy replied

  this time yes polyte but afterward
you must pay i have worn out no less
than two pencils in keeping your score

  old man polyte saw and understood
also he accepted with good grace he had
had a good time and he knew that good
times could not last forever besides it
was friday-always an unlucky day

  that night old man polyte cleaned his
huge muzzle-loader and took count of his
powder and shot daybreak found him
behind his favorite blind far out in the
heart of the marsh

  thus old man polyte missed a most
startling piece of news that was brought
in by the first early arrivals at the coffee-
house this news came from mouton and
concerned the varos the previous after-
noon they had overpowered their guard and
having taken his pistol had escaped pre-
sumably into the impenetrable cypress
swamp that encircled the parish upon the
east

v

it had been a good hunt and old
man polyte was satisfied he had
bagged a nice bunch of duck and
during a slack in the flight shortly after sun-
rise he had managed to slip aside to a
the trail at landry

near-by burn and gather in quite a respect-
able string of snipe therefore shortly
after noon he decided that for several rea-
sons he would be justified in calling it a
days work

  to begin with he had hunted the farther
marsh which involved not only the tramp
to his boat but a long row across the lake
then he must dispose of his game with
poor luck there might be no euchre before
night however the next day was sun-
day and sundays were always long and
pleasant at the coffee-house

   it lacked but a little of two oclock when
old man polyte broke through the marsh
rim at the point where he had left his boat
the going had been bad and the long string
of game had become an intolerable burden
as he pushed off old man polyte wished
that he had a pirogue instead of his clumsy
heavy skiff but pirogues held little and
were most capricious in the matter of over-
turning also the waters of the lake were
cold and deep

   it was shortly after he had left the bank
and had settled down to a steady pull that
old man polyte saw a pirogue slip out from
the bank a short distance above his starting
place two men were in the pirogue and
as they paddled swiftly out they held a
course that would bring them directly
athwart the path of the skiff observing
which old man polyte rested his oars in
anticipation of some friendly demand or
greeting

   when it was still quite a distance off the
pirogue halted abruptly and a voice shouted
a challenge across the intervening stretch
of water it was a slow unsteady voice
thick with suppressed excitement and a
too liberal indulgence in stolen brandy yet
old man polyte had little difficulty in recog-
nizing it as the voice of bebe varo

  for a moment old man polyte was over-
come by his absolute amazement he
could only falter weakly in reply-

  and so-and so-you are out again

  as you see came back the voice we
are on our way to safety but first there is
your little account to settle

  to this there seemed but one logical
reply snatching his gun old man polyte
emptied both barrels at the speaker his
intentions were good but his opponents
had chosen their distance carefully save
for a wild scatter of water several yards out
from his mark old man polyte found that

he had only wasted two charges of his wo-
fully diminished powder and shot

  the varos took their own good time in
answering him indeed so long was bb
varo in steadying himself and aiming his
pistol that old man polyte had a brief hope
that his enemies had run out of shells and
were merely trying to scare him but when
a moment later the bullet came whining
above the skiff old man polyte ducked and
considered his situation he was out-
ranged and his enemies had the whole
afternoon before them the outlook was
anything but encouraging

   after a second shot which splintered the
skiffs rail old man polyte seized his oars
and rowed blindly out toward the middle
of the lake the varos followed leisurely
until realizing the hoplessness of his flight
the fugitive came to rest again thereupon
the varos followed their former tactics only
this time it was jules who shot his bullets
going wider than those of the more accurate
bebe

  from this old man polyte deducted that
his enemies had but a single weapon be-
tween them yet the discovery brought him
little comfort evidently they were well
supplied with shells and one pistol was
amply sufficient for their purpose

  in the intervals between ducking and
dodging below the skiff edge old man
polyte emptied his gun twice in the direc-
tion of the pirogue he did this aimlessly
and half-heartedly more from the desire
to be doing something than for any other
reason then finding himself reduced to
a bare four loads he crouched low and began
to consider his plight to its final detail

   he was in a tight place and so far as he
could see there was little prospect of his
getting out with a whole skin any thought
of a rescue he dismissed at once the lake
was wide and lonely and a chance passer-by
would not be allowed to interfere the
varos would see to that escape was
equally hopeless the pirogue could over-
haul him without effort and once across and
in the heavy going of the marsh his oppo-
nents could easily pick him off from their
firmer footing ashore

  true if he could hold out until after
sunset he might get away under cover of
the darkness but this was hardly to be
expected evidently the varos were only
playing with him while their pursuers
scoured the swamp with the coming of


adventure

night they too would be faced with the
necessity of escape before the light failed
they would most certainly risk a dash inside
the dead-line but even the chance of this
was remote sooner or later they must get
in a lucky shot that would render their
finishing the affair a mere matter of pad-
dling alongside

  the next half-hour was the longest and
hardest that old man polyte had ever
known the prospect of violent death
was bad enough but worst of all was the
grim silence of the varos if they had
reviled him if they had taunted him it
would have been easier then infuriated
by their jeers he might have achieved a
state where he would have been wholly
reckless of the consequences

  but save for their first challenge the
varos hung on sullen and wordless per-
haps they counted upon the effect of their
muteness perhaps they realized that this
was no light-hearted duel but a matter
of cold-blooded assassination at all events
they uttered no heartening gibe or oath even
lowering their voices to an indistinct mur-
mur when they spoke between themselves

  jules who steadied the pirogue would
occasionally refresh himself from a bottle
which he raised with his free hand bbe
displaying a truly remarkable self-denial
touched never a drop however as he had
taken over the shooting entirely the cause
of his abstinence was only too plain

  as for old man polyte he could only sit
and watch for the next attack then it
was squirm and twist and flounder until
the fusillade was safely over

  shortly after three oclock a bullet grazed
the fleshy part of old man polytes right
arm the wound was trifling but its sig-
nificance was great each time now bebe
shot closer also emboldened by their
success the varos pushed in for a distance
of several strokes firing an experimentary
shot old man polyte found that his charge
just managed to rattle lightly against the
pirogues side at this the varos broke
their long silence with a laugh evidently
the end was close at hand

  realizing this old man polyte cast a final
sweeping glance about the lake far away
asailboat was tacking close inshore and he
waved at it frantically but either the
crew misunderstood or felt no desire to
become embroiled in anothers quarrel the
boat tacked on

  thus for the first time old man polyte
began seriously to consider the question of
a future life he thought of prayer and
wondered vaguely if it would do any good
then he remembered his saint and a flash
of sardonic humor caused him to withdraw
the case and tumble out the image upon his
leathery palm a moment he glared at the
tiny figure answering its grin with a fierce
malevolent snarl

  you are a fine saint he growled as
a protector you are no more good than one
of bebs bullets bien you will go where
you belong overside

  with his arm upraised and ready to
throw old man polyte had another idea
it now occurred to him that the image was
like a bullet in still another way it was
round and leaden and heavy-a very
proper slug in fact if he loaded it and
shot straight enough he might get bebe
varo afterward the rest would be easy

  with one eye upon the varos old man
polyte began to load the empty barrel of
his gun he worked feverishly yet he
took care to put in an extra heavy charge
of powder next he tinkled down the
image ramming it home with a thick wad-
ding of newspaper

  his enemies looked on derisively not
only had they moved in to improve their
range they had also hoped for just this
final expenditure of their victims ammuni-
tion of the consequences they had not
the slightest fear they knew that had
old man polyte been possessed of anything
heavier than birdshot he would have used
it at the start

  his loading finished old man polyte
leveled his gun steadying it upon the edge
of the skiff very carefully he shifted the
barrel until it covered a spot directly in the
center of bebe varos chest then before
he pulled he invoked the image pleading
with it in a muffled undertone

  come saint come he muttered
you can do it if you will

  at the report bebe varo jerked suddenly
to his knees there he swung for a mo-
ment uttering a strange guttural cry that
was not unlike the croak of a frog then
he pitched forward capsizing the pirogue
in a smother of icy water

  this much old man polyte saw as he
snatched his oars an instant later when
he straightened up again bebe varo was
gone jules shivering and gasping pawed
the trail at landry



desperately at the slimy bobbing bottom
of the overturned pirogue he was so close
that had he wished to the watcher could
have reached him by shoving out an oar

  good saint murmured old man polyte
as he picked up his gun and while cocking
it my old woman was right

  emulating the varos he took his own
good time with the second barrel he felt
that under the circumstances the least he
could do was to make a good job of it

vi

at nine oclock the following
morning old man polyte knocked
upon pere martains front door
in his eyes there was a furtive hunted look
yet the outthrust of his lean jaw suggested
a stubborn determination

  answering the summons himself pere
martain came out upon the porch

  well hippolyte said he

  old man polyte uncovered answering the
greeting with a brief downward jerk of his
head

  you have heard mon pere he ques-
tioned

  i have answered the priest that
is why i sent for you

  old man polyte glanced up then down
he seemed terribly ill at ease

  about the saint he muttered i am
sorry mon pere i hope that it was not
sacrilege

  if pere martain felt inclined to smile
he betrayed the fact by not so much as the
twitching of a muscle

  no it was not sacrilege he replied
besides there was nothing else to do

  so said old man polyte his tone hint-
ing at dejection rather than relief

  well hippolyte repeated the priest
this time in a voice that could not be
denied

  there fell a pause during which old man
polyte was swayed by indecision just
behind him lay the coffee-house with its
warmth its snugness its never-ending good
cheer there he would be more of a hero
than ever a seat of honor awaited him at
the second of the three card-tables in
front was the church with its cold interior

its hard kneeling benches its long scourging
sermons that were delivered against just
such sinners as himself

  old man polytes look was piteous then
it became dogged

  bien mon pere he answered as be-
fore you will find me as good as my word

a little later after the ringing
of the second bell pere martain
stood watching as the last of the

congregation entered his church beside
him prejean the baker held forth upon the
all-absorbing event of the day before

  it is incredible mon pere ran on
prejean of course nothing will be done
since the varos were fugitives and began
the affair themselves it was all seen by
those upon lartigues boat but consider
polyte here he has destroyed three
brothers-two of them with a saint

  this time pere martain permitted his
smile

  it was not a saint prejean he replied
i myself took the image to mouton where
monsieur decourt recognized it and ex-
plained it is what you call a billi-a
billi-but i can not remember the name
i can only tell you that it is a toy the pos-
session of which is supposed to bring good
luck

  just the same we all thought it a saint
polyte the most of all persisted prejean

  pere martains tone became patient

  my friend said he the workings of
providence are beyond us but of one thing
we may be sure always they result in
good use your eyes and you will see

  by now the last stragglers had entered the
church all save one this straggler tall
ancient and weatherbeaten moved gin-
gerly forward treading the worn wooden
steps as if they were a ladder of swords
upon the church porch he hesitated half-
turning as though for a backward look
across the square then with a sudden
desperate twist he lurched inside

  there was no famous exhorter no mon-
strous tabernacle no vast choir of a thou-
sand singers only the fragile priest the
tiny church the few untrained voices

  nevertheless old man polyte had hit the
trail

author of clean crazy monkeying with ancestorsetc

i - ind for the support of this
a declaration with a firm reliance
i on the protection of divine
i providence we mutually pledge
to each other our lives our fortunes and our
sacred honor

 hank padden shifted his seat on the top
pole of the corral and marks the place with
his finger

  now says he shall i orate the names
of the men who signed it

  never mind replies old man whit-
taker we dont know none of them per-
sonally so well let what youve already
read be sufficient and plenty after listen-
ing to all youve read out of that book
hank im of the impression that shes a
fitting day to be celebrated what do you
think hen

  shes worth a passing memorial says i
and scenery sims the fourth member of
our committee nods his head

  she sure is gents i never cared for
kings except in jack-pots and our glorious
forefathers sure did proclaim their feelings
im with yuh from the hondo to the saddle-
horn

  that makes it unanimous the night
before theres a meeting in paradise and
they appoints me and scenery hank pad-
den and old man whittaker as a committee
to investigate the reasons and so forth of the
fourth of july and whether in our own
minds shes of sufficient import to consider
a celebration

we finds that she is hank padden reads

us the reasons out of a dictionary while
we sets there on the corral top at the
cross j

  old man whittaker owns the cross j
hank padden the seven a and scenery
sims is the possessor of the circle s outfit
and the squeakiest voice ever anchored in
the throat of a human being every time i
hears scenery start to talk i pray for cyl-
inder oil or chloroform me im henry
clay peck i work for old man whittaker
i aint got nothing but a conscience a heap
of respect for the truth and the feeling that i
lowers myself when i punches cows

  we has just arrived at our conclusion
when muley bowles saunters down to the
corral climbs up beside us and bends our
seat all to pieces we four moves to the
next section for safety muley weighs so
much that he has to bandage his broncs
legs with splints to keep it from being bow-
legged the world lost a cracking good
poet when muley essayed to punch cows
he dont look the part not having soulful
eyes nor emaciated ribs but when it comes
to making up poetry hes got em all lashed
to the snubbing-post

   has the committee arrived at a satisfac-
tory conclusion he asks puffing hard on
his cigaret and shaking out a new rope

  when the facts is made public well let
yuh know with the rest squeaks scenery
who dislikes muley a heap

  whos talking to you demands muley
scenery you takes too much upon your-
self i been thinking of a sweet little rhyme

a prevaricated parade



what sounds like this and i gives yuh three
guesses who i mean

      he had a squeaky little voice

       a skinny little frame

      he lived in gods own country

      but the country want to blame

      comparing him with growed-up men

      who rode the sawtooth hills

      he looked like a pewter nickel
      in a bunch of green-back bills

  yah-h-h-h shrills scenery youre
sore cause you wasnt elected to the com-
mittee lard

  scenery puts all the venom in his system
into that last word and at the finish his
voice would have split a cigaret paper as
he makes his greasy statement his right
boot snaps up to horizontal and muleys
loop gets him around the ankle

  it sure was one beautiful and speedy piece
of rope work and the next minute scenery
is on his shoulders in the corral with his
right foot snubbed high and handsome to
the top of a corral post

  muley lights his cigaret and climbs down
the other side

  the committee will have to turn him
loose he states i wont pollute my
hands by touching him i reckon the acid
in his measly little carcass will ruin that
metal hondo before he gets loose but its
worth it

  muley peers through the poles of the cor-
ral and grins at scenery

  next time yuh opines to speak of a by-
product of your family scenery dont look
at me he states

  our nerves are rasped considerable before
we gets scenery calmed down but we finally
pacifies him and all sets in judgment on the
fourth of july again

  now that weve decided to celebrate-
howll we do it asks hank she ought
to be did befitting the solemnity of the occa-
sionhadnt it whittaker

  she deserves it agrees the old man
well have a salute at sunrise wont we
then whatll we do

  we got to have a pe-rade squeaks
scenery them is necessary adjunct to
celebrations i was down to cottonwood
last fourth and they sure had a humdinger
of a pe-rade had a feller all dressed up in
a fancy hat and a sash riding in front and
then comes a lot of dress-up wagons what
they designates as floats they has a
beautiful gal all dressed up to imitate miss
columbus and-

  whos she asks hank

  dont you know who columbus was
asked scenery and hank nods

  well dont ask fool questions then
squeaks scenery they has hoss-races

foot-races and-

  they didnt have nothing that we cant
have pronounces hank

  we can have all that ill ride at the

head of the pe-rade and-

  that aint unanimous interrupts sce-
nery why you any more than me hank
next thing we know youll want to be miss
columbus

  hang on to yourselves advises whit-
taker you fellers elects yourselves to
everything-seems to me a leading man
in a pe-rade ought to dress the part i
reckon when i lives in great falls im
elected as a ornery member of a organiza-
tion it had something to do about wood-
craft and we dresses up like a plush hoss
when we meets i still got my war-bonnet
and pants left some son of a gun stole
the coat i still got my ax too

  you still got the ax squeaks scenery
wonderful go home and cut some wood
i think your fires out

  while you old spavs are fighting for
honors whats the matter with considering
me i asks youre all so danged old
and stove-up that youd have to lead it in a
lumber-wagon look at me and step back

in the ranks im young handsome-

  pause yelps scenery pause hen
it takes brains to lead a pe-rade

  then lets not quarrel says i we
aint elegible lets settle these little de-
tails later and in a place what aint so dry
it wont be the fourth of july until day
after tomorrow so lets adjourn

they agrees scenery and
hank goes home and i goes up to
the bunk-house where telescope
tolliver and muley are playing pitch

  hen what has the committee decided
to do askes telescope

  i tells him what our plans are so far and
while im telling in comes chuck warner
the prize liar of yaller rock county
chuck punches cows with us for a living
and carries the greatest assortment of pre-
varications on earth as a side-line i been
with him so long that at times i shades tiie
truth a little too

  they cant all lead the pe-rade thats a
adventure

cinch states chuck i seen a pe-rade

down to new york one time that-

  you never was in new york states
telescope

  i was born there declares chuck
wiggling his ears

  in pima county arizona says tele-
scope i know when too chuck
dates dont count telescope i said i
was born in new york and its my business
if i wants to stick to my statement now
telescope if you said you was born in a
teepee on a digger reservation i wouldnt
argue with you for a minute id take it as
gospel a feller has a right to a birthplace
and i takes new york

  that argument shows chuck warner in
his native state hes got a face like a
bronc shortest legson earth and can wiggle
his ears like a burro the only time he
cant look yuh square in the eye is when hes
telling the truth

  yuh ought to get somebody with a little
style to lead that pe-rade hen opines
muley

  might get pole cat perkins or hare-
lip hansen laughs telescope have
harelip ride one of his goats and have pole
cat walk slow behind him leading a skunk
have the goat wear the old mans striped
pants and put scenerys hat on the skunk
you fellers ought to be on the com-
mittee says i sarcastic-like yuh might
get up your own pe-rade

  thats a good scheme agrees chuck
well form a offensive and defensive
alliance

  offensive is right says i and then i
goes up to see the old man

  the next morning me and the old man
goes to paradise and goes into executive
session with scenery and hank in the rear
of dug chaffins saloon hank pounds on
the table with his boot heel and calls the
roll were all present

  gents asks hank who is going to
lead the pe-rade

  we looks at each other and then the old
man clears his throat

  i looked up them lodge raiment and
theyre dazzlers

  i still got that hard hat that i wore to a
dimmicrat rally down to silver bend ten
year ago orates scenery she looks a
heap dignified and its too small for any of
you fellers i got a sword too-in a
holster

  to lead a pe-rade a man ought to
look dignified-not his clothes proclaims
hank

  this here glory thing is going to cause
hard feelings says i i moves that we
does like this well all be here before the
pe-rade is ready to start and well let some
uninterested party pick out the suitable per-
son for to lead it dress for the part and
if yuh dont get picked be a good sport and
pe-rade anyway

  thatll keep the mortality down to a
certain extent agrees hank and the other
two nods

  now says hank how about this per-
son to be miss columbus

  i got her picked states scenery i
nominates miss eulalie mcfee

  sheriffs daugher eh laughs hank
shes so danged thin that if she stood edge-
ways yuh couldnt see her scenery i
nominates miss maggie smith niece of
doughgod smith who seconds the mo-
tion

  miss columbus ought to be a danged
sight better-looking than maggie smith
states the old man who ever heard of
miss columbus with crossed eyes and
freckles i marks x at the top of my
ticket for miss clarice chaffin daughter of
dug do i hear an agreeable voice
haw haw roars hank clarice
chaffin  this contest aint for no animated
flag-pole whittaker hows your senti-
ments hen

  i leans toward mrs genevieve saun-
ders widder of the late slim saunders
shed fill the part

  it would be danged small if she didnt
scenery she weighs at least two hun-
dred and-

  scenery says i some day im going
to hang a pebble on your neck throw yuh
into a tin cup of water and drown yuh
lets vote on it suggests hank

  it dont require no vote replies whit-
taker if hen wants to drown scenery
im-

  i mean vote on the lady snaps hank
we did we each cast a vote for our
choice and it starts a argument thats a
humdinger and before we leaves the coun-
cil-chamber were mentally wallering in
each others gore

  paradise is busy fixing up floats and dec-
orations and were asked a lot of questions
that we dont dare to answer
a prevaricated parade



  who is going to lead the pe-rade
whispers doughgod to me and i whispers
back-

  i am

  he follers me for a distance and whispers
once more-

  hen who is going to be miss colum-
bus i answers-

  the widder saunders

  hank told me that my niece maggie
was going to be her

  hanks a liar says i and doughgod
nods and walks away

  im over at the rack cinching up my
saddle when here comes dug chaffm

  henry im looking for information that
i cant seem to get from any of your co-
horts who is due to be miss columbus
tomorrow

  the widder saunders thats settled
dug

  do you know that old man whittaker
is a liar he asks and i nods yes hes
a liar declares dug he said hed
stick for clarice till hell froze over

  he got cold feet says i and dug goes
back to his palace of sin in a unhappy
mood

  i gets on my bronc and points toward
the cross j im sick of being on a com-
mittee and having to hurt peoples feelings
paradise aint no safe place to cause discord
in theres a sentiment in that place that
leans towards shooting first and asking
questions afterwards theres only one
thing the whole place will agree on and
that is this yuh cant have a royal flush if
your opponent lias four kings

  stuttering stevens thought hed es-
tablish a precedent by holding one against
kings and sevens in one hand and kings and
eights in another the coroner said that
either shot would have been fatal stut-
tering must a been guilty cause no
man would steal kings to make up two
pair

  i hammers my bronc along down to
where the cross j road forks with the one
from silver bend when i hears a peculiar
noise sounds to me like a threshing
machine with st vitus dance my bronc
shows signs of nervousness so i gets off
pretty soon it comes in sight and i recog-
nizes it as being an autymobile the same of
which aint been in this country since the
one belonging to scenery sims runs over
some dynamite at piperock and evaporates

my bronc drags me off into the
mesquite for a ways until i can
get my rope around a bush and
stop him and then i pilgrims back to the
road at first i dont recognize the in-
habitant of that carriage i looks him over
careful-like and then he grins and betrays
himself its old calamity carson i
aint seen him for five years and i shakes
his hand industrious-like after we gets
through pumping elbows i leans back and
surveys his equipage

  some vehicle eh henry he says with
a dusty grin surprised to see me
well not exactly calamity we been
expecting yuh

  expecting me he wonders aloud i
suppose tellurium had to go and tell
everybody

  uh-huh i agrees tellurium woods
never could keep still

  so far as i know tellurium aint been in
paradise for six months but hes as good as
anybody to blame it on him and calam-
ity used to be pardners

  well well says calamity brushing
the dust off his mustache and giving his
cigaret a chance to burn hair freely here
i been figuring on surprising the old-timers
and i been told upon by a friend henry
peck i done sold out my property over in
the little rockies and now im rich

  i got more money than a dog has fleas
but i aint enjoyed it none i opines to
throw a surprise into paradise so i buys
this gasoline buckboard has her shipped to
silver bend and here i am shes worse
than any outlaw bronc that ever flinched
under a saddle henry and im older by
years and years than i was a week ago when
a man teached me how to drive it i dont
know what makes her run all i got to do
is put gasoline in her twist her tail a few
times pull the designated levers and point
her away from the stumps she sure makes
enough noise

  you figured the time right calamity
says i paradise sure is doing itself
proud in your honor

 in my honor whats the idea
henry

  well yuh see it aint often that a town
can have a former inhabitant come home
rich and distinguished like you are the
public sure admires a man with a chunk off
the root of all evil calamity weve dec-
orated in your honor and tomorrow we
adventure

parades before yuh to show our admiration
and respect sabe

  my gosh henry he snorts this is
too much

  its considerable calamity but look
who you are

  thats a fact henry-it sure is well
well

  he sets there with a far-away look in his
eyes and that cigaret sizzling on his mus-
tache and sudden-like he reaches under the
seat and hauls out a jug

  henry peck i been saving this for my
old friends-tellurium doughgod half
mike smith et cettry but you qualifies
henry your oration sure puts joy into
my old heart go as deep as yuh uke

  i sets there in his gas go-devil and we
swears allegiance to each other we cele-
brates our new-found friendship and re-
gales each other with anecdotes i tells
him all the neighborhood gossip and we
toast each and every one he tells me
about his property in the little rockies
and we drinks a toast to all the little
rocks

  my bronc gets the rope loose and passes
us on his way home we toasts the cross j
and my pinto

  who did yuh say was going to lead the
pe-rade in my honor asks calamity

  i am being your best friend calam-
ity im elegible ill ride that pinto bronc
at the head end of that great conglomera-
tion howd yuh like that old-timer

  i got a better idea says he solemn-
like ill teach yuh how to run this here
contraption and you lead her in this
howd yuh like to do that henry

  sounds to me like the voice of angels
what yuh packing in them two cans in the
rear

  gasoline twenty gallons i shipped
with the car all yuh got to do is to twist
that front crank until she starts humming
sabe then yuh get in and let this here
brake loose you get out and give her a
twist henry thats the first lesson

  i falls out and ambles around to the
front i grasps the crank in both hands
gives it a man-sized yank slips with both
feet and that juggernaut runs right across
my floating ribs she sure squashes me a
plenty and  dont more than start to get
up when here she comes right back to run
over me again calamity stops her just in
time

  you forgot the e-mergency observes
calamity scared-like over the back of the
seat

  maybe says i i forgot my name
and address too if thats anything to snort
over what are yuh supposed to do-put
her against a rock to start her

  its a simple thing hen

  yes so is a stick uh dynamite says i
rubbing the kinks out of my hide lets
not call school right now calamity well
go up to the cross j where prying eyes can
see us not and there yuh can show me all
things anyway yuh dont want to show
up in paradise today everybody is busy
getting things ready and if you was to go
down there now theyd drop everything
sabe

  popularity warmeth my cold heart says
he being of the committee henry
peck i bows to superior wisdom well
proceed to the old cross j and take a
lesson

  we stops at the seeping springs and has a
nice drink-out of the jug we starts out
merrily along the road when all to once
calamity starts to tell me a story calam-
ity must have french blood in his carcass
cause he talks with his hands

  at least he might a picked out a flat
place to do his gestures in but as it was we
hops off the road down a hill and pokes
the front end of that machine into a mes-
quite bush what part of it didnt plow
through the bush jumped over

  i untangles myself from the brush and
wanders over to the wagon she dont
seem hurt much but her heart has quit
beating

  hyas cultus chuck chick states a voice
and i turns to see old running wolf a
piegan squatting on his haunches looking
at that machine

  hes got a look on his face that colum-
bus might a had when he first saw the
shores of our fair country

  what did he say asks a weak voice
and calamity appears from the other side of
the car

  he said its a mighty bad wagon 
i interprets and calamity nods his head

  that injun aint no danged idiot
henry wonder if hed like to take a
ride

  mesika klataiva kopa chick chick i
asks but the old redskin puts his thumb up
to his nose and wiggles his fingers at us
a prevaricated parade



 nah-h-h-h-h he gargles and points at
 his moccasins

 we manages to get that wagon back on
 the road we drinks a toast to our good
 luck and to honest and cautious injuns and
 plods on up to the cross j i reckon our
 toasts covers too much territory cause
 when calamity opines to have me read his
 book of rules all i can do is sing

 its almost dark when i wakes
 up beside me on the bunk is
 calamity snoring like a shepherd
 so i sticks my boot into his ribs

 thanks says he after a look around
 thanks henry i was having a autymo-
 bilemare

 just then in comes old man whittaker
 he looks around sort of mad-like and
 glares at me and calamity

 they dont seem to be here-gol dingle
 dangle it he yelps

 me and calamity looks around and
 shakes our heads

 no says i they must a left

 they never went alone he howls
 that fancy lodge war-bonnet and them
 striped pants never went away alone i
 reckon i got to kill somebody

 he slams the door as he goes out and
 calamity looks at me

 whats the matter with him he asks

 - he never recognized me and ive knowed
 whittaker for years and years

 crazy says i he went crazy over
 fancy clothes he dont know anybody
 any more calamity

 pshaw i knowed he wasnt-

  we hears a voice at the door and i yells
  come in and in ambles pole cat perk-
  ins hes got a bundle under his arm and
  he sets down on the bunk and grins at me
  and calamity

 huh-hen im after your permission
 says he

 youve got it pole cat what yuh
 going to do with it

 he unrolls that bundle and produces a
 valler stove-pipe hat dented and moth-
 eaten and an old rusty sword he bal-
 ances that old hat on his ball-shaped head
 and runs the sword along the palm of his left
 hand

  do i qualify mister peck he asks

 for certain places pole cat whats
 the idea

 chuck gives me these habiliments and

tells me that ill have to get your permis-
sion to lead the pe-rade tomorrow i ad-
mires the chance so much that  aint lost
no time in coming do i get it

  pole cat says i solemn-like you
probably will let your judgment be your
guiding star

  thanks henry i bids yuh good after-
noon

   better make it farewell says i

   loco crop must be flourishing up here
observes calamity some smells worse
than others henry

   this one is named after his associates
says i and just then somebody rides up to
the door and i hears harelip hansens voice
get behind the bunk i hisses at calam-
ity if harelip sees you up here he never
will leave

  howdy henry says harelip im
glad to see yuh

   im pleased to know that the sight of me
makes folks glad says i what yuh got
on your mind and under your arm

   he unrolls enough for me to see that hes
got whit takers lodge clothes

   chuck told me i could wear these at the
front end of that pe-rade tomorrow but id
have to see you first

  what do yuh reckon to have me do-
dress yuh i asks and he grins all over his
homely face

   itll be all right will it he asks and i
nods and replies

divinity that shapes our ends

  uh-huh i gives you thanks henry
ill take em harelip says i  may
never have any use for them but it will be
something to remember yuh by old trailer
i watches him climb on his flea-bitten
cayuse and jog off down the road calam-
ity is looking over my shoulder and as
harelip drifts out of sight he yelps

  wheres my aulymobile henry we
left her right out there didnt we

  we goes out and looks around theres
the tracks we made when we came in and
theres the tracks where it went out and
back down the road calamity scratches
his head and hitches up his pants

  henry says he im sorry what
yuh going to lead that pe-rade in now

  i simply shakes my head and says to
myself

   thats going to be a wrcll-led pe-rade
shes already got two front ends
io

adventure

  henry says calamity pointing at the
dust they just missed that gate-post as
they goes out and they didnt get on to the
road for a hundred yards id opine that
they aint familiar with the thing

  was there anything left under the seat
i asks

  one two-gallon jug henry-and what
was left in ours

  there is much to look forward to ca-
lamity says i maybe we better take a
shovel along i hope they dont bust up
your machine

  dont let that molest your heart strings
henry i been thinking for several days
thay maybe shes going to be a fatal fad
of course its going to spoil my entry into
paradise a person of my financial stand-
ing hadnt ought to enter his old home
town except in a fitting equipage aint i
right henry

  well says i since the old man left
with his buckskin team and rattle wagon
and some heartless hombre has turned loose
every bronc on the place there aint no
mode of locomotion in sight except them
two burros up there at the cook-shack
are yuh too proud to straddle a jackass
calamity

   tll soon be dark henry many a man
has done tilings in the dark that he wouldnt
do in the light lets equip the shameful
things and be on our way

  we puts saddles on them long-eared
things and pilgrims off down the road in the
dusty dusk when we comes opposite the
saunders place i pulls up

  whow says i i got a mission to per-
form we got to have a miss columbus
for your pe-rade calamity and i got to
bear her the news

  we goes up and knocks on her door and
informs her of the fact

  my gosh henry says she i aint
got nothing to wear

  maam says calamity bowing low
dont you let that worry yuh a figure
like yours dont need no clothes

  the door shuts off the conversation and
we wanders back to our trusty steeds

  calamity you been a lot of help to me
this evening says i you sure cut our
cinch with the widder saunders

  im prostrated with grief orates the old
pelican anyway i dont see what co-
lumbus has to do with my home-coming
henry

  i cant explain it to yuh calamity
youd have to see it for yourself

  we pilgrims down to paradise and ties
our steeds on a side street theres a
scarcity of rolling stock in sight and it
makes me wonder a heap usually yuh
can see broncs tied all over town when a
celebration is in prospect

  we pokes along up the street to mike
pellys saloon and goes inside mike is
alone in there setting at the end of the bar
with a shotgun beside him

  whats the matter with paradise i
asks

  civilization says mike

  are we welcome asks calamity ta-
king in the attitude of mike and sizing up
the place

  you are replies mike this place is
neutral id advise you to get out of line
with that window the town is divided
against itself

  what causes the divisions i asks ta-
king mikes advice

  mike bites off a fresh chew and settles
back in his chair

      numerous and sundry tilings
henry old man whittaker is set-
-c- ting up there in hendersons bar-
bershop with a winchester swearing hes
going to perforate harelip hansen who is
across the street in dug chaffins corral
nursing a peeled nose and a six-shooter
the old man swears that harelip stole his
clothes

  pole cat perkins is behind my place
here trying to jam some lead into scenery
sims before scenery can slip some to him
it seems that their trouble grows out of a
clothes controversy too pole cat avers
that hes going to slit scenery with a rusty
sword

  doughgod smith seems to be seeking
hank paddens gore over something about
columbus daughter and dug chaffins got
the same thing against old man whittaker
and orates his intentions of puncturing the
old mans hide for prevarication bill
mcfee refuses to arrest anybody except
scenery sims and his feelings seem some
rasped over this same columbus thing
who in-is miss columbus henry

  i dont know

  you dont eh laughs mike the

-yuh dont you sure ought to henry

yuh sent notes to both of the mudgett
a prevaricated parade



sisters to hulda peterson cook at the tri-
angle annie schmidt at the seven a and
to mrs breezy benson asking em to fill
the part every one of them has been
down here looking for you today accord-
ing to what i can find out there cant more
than one be it and that seems to cause a
heap of dissatisfaction henry abe mud-
gett and breezy was here today and they
are wishful to see yuh

  henry says calamity youve over-
done your duty

  it would look thataway to a innocent
bystander i agrees wheres all the
broncs mike did everybody walk in
today

  thats where the civilization part comes
in a autymobile invades our fair city
today and she swept us clean of hossflesh
out on them racks is fifteen pieces of rope
flopping in the breeze old man whit-
takers buckskin team was in the lead the last
we seen of the race thats why nobody is
leaving theyd rather be shot at than
walk

  who had the autymobile asks ca-
lamity

  nobody knows it went too fast for us
to see

  hoo hoo comes a voice from outside
and we all ducks hoo hoo she comes
again and then we hears a female voice
is mister peck in there

  go out and see who it is i whispers to
mike but he shakes his head

  not me she wants you henry

  she can take it out in wanting i dont
take no chances you go out calamity
nobodys got a thing against you
calamity thinks it over and then goes out
all humped like he was suffering from kidney
disease me and mike lays low and pretty
soon calamity comes sneaking back

  it was that female person we went up to
see he states she wishes to forgive me
and wants me to tell you that shell take up
your offer henry shell be miss co-
lumbus

  another victim grunts mike youre
a bigger liar than chuck warner

  he done it for me defends calamity
henry wanted to make my homecoming a
complete success and it aint all his fault if
it dont exactly work out when a man
has a pe-rade given in his honor he cant
kick if some of the details do get a little
balled up



  in your honor wonders mike out loud
are you fourth of july mister

  fourth of july calamity looks at
me and mike and then seems to dig deep-
like into his memory for buried information

  while he seems to check off some num-
bers on his fingers i edges toward the back
door he nods sort of agreeable-like
chaws one side of his mustache and fingers
his waistline where his gun makes a bulge
fourth of july he mutters uh-huh

thats right henry peck told me-

  i opens the door easy-like and misses the
rest of the complaint

  now says i to me youre branded as
a liar henry peck the best thing you can
do is to get your little jackass and go home
your forefathers never fought for glorious
freedom so there aint no use of you cele-
brating the happy event the men who
were responsible for the pecks family tree
was all hung for lying and stealing long be-
fore the declaration of independence was
signed

  with these few cheering words ringing in
my windpipe i ambles around the corner
and down to where we left them burros i
gets there just in time scenery sims is
untying one of my trusty animiles so i
quickens my pace and shoves a gun in his
ribs

  unhand that charger i roars in his ear
and scenery wilts against the hitchrack
you danged burro thief i hisses if
you wants to lead that pe-rade-go get
your own rolling stock

  i-i-i dud-dont want to le-lead noth-
ing but the sus-simple life he stutters i
want to go home henry pup-pole cat
shot the back out of my suspenders and
stuck a bullet into the cylinder of my gun
so she wont work im through hen
you lead it

  here comes somebody down the street
toward us puffing like a bronc with the
heaves he lopes up to us sticks his heels
into the ground and skids around to the op-
posite side of the burros it is old man
whittaker

  quick he pants im rushed to
death

then he begins to fuss with a tie rope
is speed essential i asks and he
snorts you know it is im out of shells
-got more at the ranch dang the man
what tied this rope

  just then somebody fires a shot up the


adventure

street and i dont hesitate i hops on to
that rocky mountain canary sets my spurs
into his hide and down the street we goes
frog-hopping high wide and handsome
a bullet plows under my steed and he sails
out of paradise faster than any burro ever
did before or since

  we keep up that speed for about a mile
and then slows down to a amble i know
where a pack-trail leaves the main road a
mile or so above where the road does so i
opines to take the shortest route to the
cross j i leads my animile while i
searches for the trail in the dark and all to
once  hears voices down the road i hears
muleys bass and chucks baritone a cross
between a greaseless wheel and pneumonia
raised in song-

   it was at aunt dinahs quilting

partee-e-e-e- 

  then telescopes tenor rings in-

   i was see-e-e-e-e-eing nellie-e-e-e-e
home 

  thas harmonee i hears chuck opine
les all shing holy city lash night as i
lay shecping-shay teleschope why dont
this machine go on eh

  how do i know replies telescope
shomebody light nother match so i can
read the reashon in the little book

  aw who cares asks muley lets
have more cheer-listen

          i love a little lager beer

          i love a little wine

          a little bit a alcohol
          makes my heart feel fine

         but when i want a reglar drink

        to make my feelings hug

          i take a little snifter
          from the old brown jug

  i sets there and listens to that kind of a
conversation for a while they tries to sing
another song but she dont finish and after
a while i wanders down and looks em over

chuck is in the bottom of the
machine with his boots hanging
over the dashboard while telescope
is doubled up in the seat with his feet on
chucks head muley is on the ground
with his head through a space in a front
wheel where some spokes are missing and
hes snoring by note

  i rolls him away from the machine i
gives telescope a gentle shove hangs on to
his leg so he wont hit too hard and deposits
him along with muley chuck is wedged in

there pretty tight and when i opines to
loosen him a little he orates something
about wanting his maw to wake him up
cause hes going to be queen of the may i
never did like to ride alone so i lets him
stay it pains me to see the flower of young
manhood in the gutter of alcohol thataway
i finds the jug and am glad to see that part
of it is still there

  i drinks what would measure about three
inches in a wash-tub before i remembers
how calamity runs that machine but all to
once she comes back to me i sets that
brake gives her a mighty twist and away
she goes whirrup whirrup whirrup zuz
zuz zuz zuz

  ive rode a lot of broncs that didnt sabe
the meaning of a bit but that thing was less
bridlewise than anything i ever seen we
grinds back toward paradise smelling of
burnt grease gasoline and so forth i takes
another look into that jug and feels so ele-
vated that i puts my feet over the dash-
board somehow that seems to give the
critter more freedom and we goes faster

  i gets so expert right away that i can
drive one-handed and i discovers a little
jigger on the handle that will make her
prick up her ears at a touch i gives her a
few touches and marvels at how fast the
mesquite goes past when all to once i hears
a yelp and we hits something or somebody
and when i stops im cross ways of the
road

  my machine is as dead as a nail pretty
soon i hears a rustling noise in the dark
and then old man wliittakers voice

  who run into me gol dingle dang yuh
blasted mule couldnt run faster than i
could hey you feller with a autymobile
aint yuh got no sense gol dang your
soul ill show yuh how yuh can run me
down bang

  he cut loose with that six-gun and i drops
out the other side and sneaks behind a tree

  i hears the old man cussing some more
and pretty soon he finds the machine and
strikes a match he has to light the second
one before he finds what hes looking for
he holds the match above his head for a
minute and then wails

  gol dang yuh chuck why didnt yuh

speak aw - chuckie where did i

hit yuh cant yuh speak to a feller are

yuh dead my-

  hes silent for a spell and then he
starts again
a prevaricated parade

  wheres that danged slow-footed mule
here yuh are yuh long-eared snail got to
get a doctor self-defense-nope acci-
dent whoa maybe his neck is broke
too aw this aint no way to celebrate
nohow

  he pilgrims off up the road complaining
about everything and cussing that mule for
taking him all over the state instead of
straight to the cross j id opine that the
old man was so excited that hed taken the
wrong road out of town

  i hauls the front end of that machine
around again and winds her up if that
front end hadnt been against a rock my
obituary would have been written right
there in the dusty road cause shes wide
open with no brake set shes backing and
filling when i hops aboard and we begins
our merry ride once more

  i rubs my heel on chucks ear and yells
chuck youre dead old man whit-
taker shot yuh

  thas good he replies same to you
and many of em

  we runs slow-like to paradise and i
bumps the front end of the machine into
mcfees corral to stop her i gives chuck
an alcoholic anesthetic and leaves him
there i ambles over to the town and finds
a crowd in front of mikes place i moves
up closer and hears the conversation

  it was deplorable i hears old man
whittaker state with tears in his voice i
loved chuck like he was my own son it
was a accident bill-just accidental you
dont think id kill him with malice afore-
thought do yuh bill

  we can tell better what yuh killed him
with after we sees the re-mains replies
bill i cant help jailing yuh whit its
the law if youre innocent yuh aint got
nothing to fear i got scenery sims down
there now so yuh wont get lonesome
what did scenery do asks the old
man

  disturbed the peace this place is law-
abiding if yilh asks me just for the looks
of the thing well take doc milliken along
while we gets your victims body where
did yuh say this here dastardly deed was
done

  it wasnt dastardly whoops the old
man it was accidental i tell yuh it
happens near where the old pack-trail leaves
the main road you know where that
is

  i know wait a minute fellers and
ill be with yuh

  he takes the old man and goes off down
toward the jail and when he comes back
they all gets in that wagon and rattles off
down the road the old man must a been
rattled cause it happens a long ways this
side of the pack-trail end thats where i
leaves muley and telescope

  mike and calamity stands there on the
porch as the wagon leaves and i hears mike
yell at bill

  hey bill be sure and get back before
sunrise on account of them salutes

  what salutes is them asks calamity
bills got em down in the jail hes got
five ten-gallon kerosene cans full of water
down there and in each can is six sticks of
dynamite wrapped in canvas and covered
with axle-grease theyre all ready to
touch off some salute eh now if
bills late we wont have our sunrise sa-
lute

  they goes back inside i looks at my
watch and sees that its danged near morn-
ing and at the same time i gets a happy
idea i ambles back to the autymobile
and finds chuck setting on the seat holding
his head in his hands

  henry says he how came i here and
why am i so dry

  i brought yuh here chuck and i hid
the jug under the wagon

  i gives him a shock and he gets en-
thusiastic

  chuck says i would yuh like to hear
a big big noise

  thats the idea henry-a great big
noise cant be too big where yuh going
to get it

  i tells him about them loaded cans down
at the jail and hes for me we enthuses
over the jug a little more and then goes
down to the jail i posts chuck about a
hundred feet from the jail and tells him to
watch for anybody coming from town

fwhnnrl the paradise jail aint much
its one story mostly dobe and
stands way out from any other
shack a grim reminder that there still is law
and order-at times a strong man might
kick the walls loose if they wasnt afraid the
roof would fall on em i takes a rock and
busts the padlock theres only one cell in
the place and when i lights a match i sees
the faces of scenery sims and the old man


adventure

i busts the lock off the cell door and lets em
out

 vamoose i whispers get a-go-
ing we dont want no lynching in para-
dise on the fourth of july

  but henry- squeaks scenery

 no time for argument i snaps
youll find out later go fast and far
sabe

  ill make this right with you henry
says the old man earnest-like and i nods
in the dark and says to myself-

  youll likely try

  they slips out together and in about a
minute i hears chuck come up to the door
and he seems peevish over something

  hen he whispers aw hen henry
peck

  i dont say nothing and pretty soon he
remarks sad-like

  drunk saw two henry pecks go away
from here must be drunk as a boiled
owl

  he goes out of hearing complaining to
himself about the effects of alcohol on the
optic nerves

  i takes the dynamite out of them cans
and puts it in one pile on the floor bill
must a been afraid of that stuff cause hes
got about ten minutes worth of extra
fuse

  i runs the fuse out the door puts the pad-
lock back in place and touches her off i
goes back up to mikes place but dont go
in mike and calamity are playing cards
while they waits for chucks body to arrive
so i goes over and climbs up on the hitch-
rack i gets up there and gets right down
comes a rumble and a shake the town is lit
up for a second and then it begins to rain
pieces of jail all over town thirty sticks
of dynamite is some little dwelling-mover

  mike and calamity staggers out on the
porch and gazes at the world

  what do yuh reckon it was gasps
calamity

 dynamite yells mike theres-

to pay and no pitch hot

  billmcfee insisted on leaving that stuff
in the jail until it was time to touch it off
and he done put old man whittaker and
scenery sims in there-and-they both
smoke

  gosh all hemlock wails calamity
there aint a tiling we can do is there
mike

 nothing when youre near thirty

sticks of dynamite and she goes off there
aint notliing that anybody can do-not
even the coroner

  they dont much more than get inside
when i hears the rattle of wheels and into
paradise comes the ambulance they
swings around in front of the place and
stops out comes mike and calamity

  was he dead asks mike and we hears
mcfee snort

  old man whittaker must be crazy
we couldnt find chuck nor the autymobile
all we found was muley and telescope set-
ting along the road trying to sing they
dont know about no shooting scrape
whittaker is a danged old liar

  dont speak disrespectable of the dead
advises calamity no matter how a man
acted in this vale of tears yuh hadnt ought
to besmirch his memory with recrimina-
tions

  he aint dead i tell yuh yelps bill
well says mike if he aint hes
made of iron no man can stand a shock
like that and ever be the same

  shock who do yuh mean-chuck
no says mike sad-like i mean
whittaker

  and scenery sims adds calamity re-
moving his hat they must a threw a
match on to a fuse the padlock came
through the back door and is sticking in
mikes bar

  theres complete silence for a while and
then mcfee gasps-

 my-

  he yanks the team around and away he
goes rattlety bang down toward the jail
while the crowd races along behind him
muley and telescope sets there on the steps
and finishes up their song

  ret-ret-retribution pronounces tele-
scope the old man kills chuck and then
gets hoist with his own petard

  hoisted corrects muley i never
heard dynamite called petard but a rose by
any other name would smell as sweet some
celebration eh telescope i wonder if
anybody has yet killed henry peck this fair
morning

  the day is yet young so why worry
says telescope i fain wouldst look upon
the red when it is wine lets tend a little
bar muley

  i wanders around back of mikes place
i feels weary and when i notices mikes
little barn i gets an inspiration why not
a prevaricated parade



sleep until celebration time i climbs into
the loft and sprawls on the hay

  all the comforts of home says i out
loud

  hey henry comes a whisper was
chuck dead

  uh-huh says i is scenery with
yuh

  he is squeaks scenery what was
that explosion henry

  they say that harelip and pole cat
blew up the jail i dont know how much
truth there is in it 

  henry quavers the old man you was

a friend in need ill-

  just then a faint voice begins singing
somewhere in the hay its a voice that
nobody ever heard and forgot cross be-
tween a greaseless wheel and pneumonia

  rockuhvages clef for me-e-e le me

hide myself- 

  we listens for a few seconds old man
whittaker gathers his legs under himself like
a rabbit and shoots out a that hay-loft like
a swaller we hears him hit the ground
and gallop out of range scenery dont say
a word he yawns crawls over to the win-
dow and lets himself down easy-like and
sneaks away

  henry says chuck did i hear your
voice

  you did

  stop talking to yourself you shepherd
and let a man sleep i had a awful dream
henry dreamed that the world blowed
up it hit me and-ho hum-m-m

  ho hum-m-m-m says i and goes to
sleep too

when i woke up the birds were
singing and the sun was shining
through the cracks in the loft
chuck is still snoring so i climbs down
alone im as dry as a drouth in arizona
so i pilgrims into mikes place regardless of
consequences

   the place is fairly filled and sadness is the
prevailing color scheme on the bar stands
scenerys old stove-pipe hat with a wide
band of black cloth around it and mikes
mirror is hung with the emblem of
mourning

  mcfee is standing there with bowed head
and sadness fairly drips from his lips

  its a most awful situation he orates
if we could only find a single piece of em
there aint nothing left-nothing

  there aint nothing left of poor chuck
either tolls muley poor old chuck
he was a gentleman and a scholar id love
to gaze upon his face once more

      hes went away and left us
         in the prime of his young life

      hes gone from this here vale of tears
         with all its joy and strife

      no more well see his banty legs

          nor hear him tell a lie

      hes vanished from old paradise

        and we never said good-by

  thats a mighty pretty thing muley
applauds pole cat cant yuh think of
something nice to say for old man whit-
taker

   the rest of you fellers stand back from
pole cat and harelip and old man whit-
taker will say something for himself states
a voice at the door and there stands the old
man with a shotgun which he levels at
pole cat and harelip

  the crowd obeys bill mcfees legs
get so weak that he sets down on the
bar-rail where he gasps like a fish out of
water

  you danged pair of dynamiters snaps
the old man with the shadder of the
gallows staring me in the eye and chuck
warners ghost haunting my dreams i
comes back to show yuh that your das-
tardly deed failed when yuh blowed up
that jail yuh didnt get me and scenery
sabe shut up he snaps as harelip
starts to say something dont try to
deny it harelip i can prove it by the
heero what let us out there he stands
gents henry clay peck he busted the
lock and liberated-

   the crowd turns to look at me but i dont
seem to be the point of interest at that
they looks right past me old man whit-
takers gun slips from his hands and clangs
on the floor i twists my neck and looks
behind me and there stands chuck he
yawns and leans against the pool-table

  well says chuck in a dry voice
aint somebody going to set em up
sleeping in timothy makes a feller dry

  bill mcfee looks at chuck and back at
whittaker and the tears of joy runs out of
his eyes whittaker leans against the door
and tries to laugh but he cant

   haw says harelip but thats as far as
he got

  chuck ambles up to the bar and looks
em over
adventure

  holy henhawlts he snorts have
yuh all gone loco

  aint-aint yuh dead chuck stutters
the old man

  almost-from thirst

  bill mcfee has been looking steady-like
at me for some time and when he gets on his
feet he sort of starts edging toward me i
edges the other way sort of unconcerned-
like and bumps into calamity hes got a
billiard cue in his hands

  henry he whispers you lied to me
i nods kicks his feet out from under him
and goes out of that back door like a shot
i races around to the front and runs into
something theyre grouped and im into
em before i has time to think

  theres the two mudgett sisters hulda
peterson annie schmidt mrs benson
maggie smith clarice chaffin and the
widder saunders the male members of
the vigilance committee is abe mudgett and
breezy benson

  weve been waiting for you henry
states the widder sort of belligerent-like
and the chorus sings the last four words

  were looking for a little explanation
from you states breezy benson and abe
nods-

  we desires the same

  exactly says i in the course of

human e-vents-

  grab that dynamiter yells mcfee
from the front door and breezy tried to foi-
ler instructions anybody that reaches out
to grasp old man pecks loving son henry in
times of stress is in continuous danger
breezy got it on the jaw and yours truly
went away from there with the enraged citi-
zens on the trail

  never again do i sic a pack of hounds
after a coyote what few broncs are in
town are immediate and soon rode after me
and i sure have a plenty to attend to i
got a good start but i know i cant keep it
forever im hopping oh down a washout
when i happens to see mcfees corral i
gets an idea right there

  the gang is quite a ways behind me try-
ing to make me come out of a old shack so i
takes a chance and races for lhat corral
the autymobile is pointed the wrong way
and i aint got no time to turn it around i
yanks the front wheels around sets the
brake grabs the crank and prays bingo
she took it the first turn i yanks off the
brake and away i goes straight for the
posse

  i yanks the little jigger down and we sure
hits for paradise in a hurry they scat-
ters at my approach swings in behind me
and up the main street of paradise we goes
strung out for a quarter of a mile and
stretching all the time

  that machine was a humdinger as long
as im in danger but when i leaves em far
behind she lays down and quits like a yal-
ler pup i sets there and looks around and
out into the road wanders three saddled
broncs i ducks thinking theyre some of
the posse but a second look tells me that
theyre some of the broncs what left para-
dise yesterday when the autymobile first
came in

  one cross j bronc has a long rope drag-
ging- so i catches him and then ropes the
other two i strings out across the hills
toward home puts em in the home corral
and goes to bed i reckon its almost morn-
ing when the cross j bunch gets home

all comes into the bunk-house but they
dont see me

  ho hum-m-m-m yawns the old man

had a pe-rade that well date time from
we had eight miss columbuses and-

  who-who led it i asks

  hy royp churchill

author ofthe welding a shift ituo reverse etc

       s the steam-launch shoved off
from the protecting sides of
the cruiser glouster the fog
	swallowed her up in a couple

of boat lengths but failed to soften or hide
the growing enmity between two members
of her crew kirk morton the coxswain
stood with his hands on the steering wheel
and his eyes on the dancing needle of the
compass as he guided the launch through
the ghostly vapor which shut the little
boat and its crew of five into a world apart
outside on the boats small deck in the
bowmans place singleton smith until
recently known as hobo smith balanced
himself on bare widespread toes holding
his boat-hook with one hand and the
launchs canopy with the other while he
peered forward into the gray wall ahead

  but the thoughts of these two men were
little taken up with their work their
closeness to one another despite the duty
in hand was almost an overwhelming
irritant kirk morton was a master hand
at the wheel of the steam-launch-nick-
named the jumping jack-and he had
brought her out when waves threatened
to drown the fire by way of the smoke
stack and maneuvered alongside the ship
when an error of an ounce of pressure on
the wheel or a second of time would have
smashed her like an egg against the side

  but coupled with this expertness was a
certain habit of smuggling aboard a couple
of bottles of native drink for the useof
himself and friends this morning on

account of it he had been compelled to ask
for a relief bowman and as usual smith
had been detailed

  cant you give me some one else sir
he complained to the officer of the deck as
the cargo was loaded this fellows no
good and the officer had looked at him
coldly without reply

  and the dog too grumbled morton
pointing to the first divisions mascot
already curled up on one of the boxes in the
stern sheets

  yes said the officer in a tone which
meant that morton had gone as far as he
dared shove off and lets hear no more

  so it was that kirk morton not only
carried hobo smith but smiths dog arab
a full-grown shaggy airedale whose home
from puppyhood had been the forecastle
of the glouster and whose friends were
smiths friends in the exact ratio of that
relationship for true to his breed arab
was loyal and smith was master supreme
he lay now between smiths widespread feet
with his head on his paws and his alert
brown eyes searching the fog bank ahead with
every acute instinct smith raised one of
his feet and stroked across the shaggy head
and arab smiled up at him with a wave of
his tail

  unconscious of the obtrusion the end of
the tail settled back across kirk mortons
view of the compass and with an exclama-
tion of anger he struck down across it
cruelly with the hard edge of his open hand
he had expected a yelp of pain but arab


adventure

did not cry out instead he reversed in-
stantly and his long-jawed wicked muzzle
appeared in mortons face the dog knew
his enemies as well as his friends and his
lips were drawn back from his white keen
teeth and his soft brown eyes had become
bright points of yellow flame

  morton jumped back as smiths restrain-
ing hand was laid on arab one vicious
snap of the jaws had come uncomfortably
close to his face

  youd better hold him he told smith
and turned to the fireman behind him
give me that short slice bar ill fix this

-pup so he wont be so anxious to take a

bite out of a fellow what he needs is a
few manners

  let the dog alone said smith leaning
over and putting his head under the canopy
wliat did you want to pinch his tail for
he wasnt hurting you

  one of the hardest things that arab had
to learn as he grew to full strength was
that his friends and even his master
preferred sometimes to fight without help
from him this was one of the times
smith had dragged him back and told him
to lie on the deck waves of hatred surged
through him and kept the hair on his back
in a bristle but to make doubly sure that
this time he was not to interfere his master
called to the sternman on the launch-

 keep arab out of this will you
jimmy

 at the same time kirk morton was
saying as he rang to shut off the engine
and climbed out on deck

  well settle this thing now the dog
gets a licking and it just suits me to start
on you shut in by the fog and safe
from interference it was mortons oppor-
tunity to show smith his place ill make
this boat too hot a place for any trimming
upstart to light on trying to take a mans
billet away from him

  this was mortons real grievance smith
had been the joke of the ship a dirty un-
redeemed tramp and after a bitter struggle
helped immeasurably by the airedale
puppy he had fought back to manhood
mortons words brought the hot blood
to smiths face it was not his fault that
the coxswain was becoming unreliable and
to be called a trimmer-an officers pet-
was deadly insult to any sailor he took a
step forward with fists clenched and
morton met him with a blow

  the two men were evenly matched in
size but morton had the advantage of
having his back to the canopy and the
comparatively secure footing of the widest
portion of the small deck while smith had
to balance himself further forward where
one step either way or behind him would
put him overboard thus it was that he
could not well dodge mortons blow so he
parried and clenched to keep from being
forced off the deck straining and whirling
locked in each others arms the two
stumbled over smiths discarded boat-hook
and fell to the deck morton on top

  arab whimpered under the restraining
hand of the sternman but knew that until
his master called him he must keep out
with a mighty heave smith strained up-
ward to get the advantage and the men
rolled back to the wide part of the deck
just over the steering wheel

  look out you two yelled fatty
walters the engineer and made a frantic
grab for the compass

  he was too late the instrument was
upset rolled to the side of the boat and fell
overboard

  for several precious seconds they con-
tinued struggling while walters secured a
boat-hook and made ineffectual jabs which
only succeeded in turning the compass over
and sinking it lower in the water as still
alloat in its small wooden box it bobbed out
of reach and disappeared in the fog for the
launch was still going ahead of its mo-
mentum

  cut it out appealed the engineer
turning his boat-hook on the fighting men
youve kicked the compass overboard

  with the full meaning of the loss gaining
a place in their wrought up minds smith
and morton sat up

  itll float said morton between pants
as he scrambled back into the cockpit and
rang for full speed well pick it up
which way did it go

  the fireman pointed and turning in a
swift arc the launch cut back into the fog
after five minutes of fruitless circling
morton was ready to give up

  its gone down he announced sullenly
well have to go on without it

  we ought to signal the ship with the
whistle and go back to her for a new com-
pass said smith

  im running this launch said morton
keep your mouth out and he turned
off the course

the boat in what he thought was the general
direction of the shore and went ahead at
full speed

  yet smiths protest had been well taken
for the boat was loaded to her full capacity
with rifle ammunition for the landing party
ashore and the search for the compass was
enough to bewilder any sense of direction

cscp the landing force from the
 glousler had first taken possession
  of the haitian ports custom house
and gradually widened its sphere of influ-
ence until it controlled the bay on which
the town was built but this bay was
divided by a point of land from a smaller
one which had only a rude cluster of native
huts on its protected shore-line but which
was still in command of the revolutionists

  the sides of this bay were mountainous
and thick-grown with jungle vegetation
and after a couple of attacks when the
landing force had found the houses deserted
by all except the women and children the
sailors had adopted the easier policy of
letting the remnants of revolutionary bands
driven from the larger town gather there
unmolested to grow tired of the unequal
struggle and return to peaceful pursuits
cut off as they were from all supplies par-
ticularly ammunition

  but kirk morton knew that the blame
for the loss of the compass would rest on
him even though it had been smiths foot
which had sent it overboard for he was in
charge and had started the fight but he
hoped to have this offset somewhat if he
could deliver his cargo without delay and
so he meant to take a chance

 after a time smith spoke again he
was standing as far forward as he could
balance himself peering intently ahead and
the airedale stood at his side with every
muscle and nerve alert

  it dont sound right he said and
despite the anger which leaped over him
at mortons sneer he continued we would
be out of luck if we hit the upper bay
instead of the one we control you know
the shore is steeper on that side and it
would make the engine sounds different
the other men of the crew were interested
if morton was not and smith kept on

 look at the dog see how hes all
bristled up he senses something strange
about where we are

  bosh scoffed morton and kept ahead

beginning to be worried under his mask of
indifference but too proud and too con-
temptuous of hobo smith to acknowledge
that he might be wrong

  the fog seemed to be thicker than ever
and stubbornly the coxswain drove the
little boat on through it his first warning
of the seriousness of the boats danger
was seeing hobo smith and arab as they
stood on the bow go plunging forward over-
board as the boats keel scraped on the
first outlying branches of a coral reef and
came to a sudden stop among the spongy
dripping mass being not seriously damaged
and almost on an even keel but stuck hard
and fast

  and then kirk morton in a moment of
panic did a very foolish thing he ordered
the engineer to back her at full speed and
the continued thrash of the screw in its
ineffectual attempt to pull the boat off
made noise enough to be heard on the close-
lying shore and advertised that the boat
was in trouble

  pull the whistle cord advised smith
perhaps the ship will hear us

  well lie still and see where we are
first objected morton who knows
whether weve hit the upper bay or not
he had dropped his voice to a hoarse
whisper and continued theres been too
much talking in the boat keep quiet all
of you

  morton was so anxious to discount any
suggestion of smiths that his own judgment
was warped

  at the end of ten minutes the engineer
whispered a protest

  the tides going out and were getting
stuck harder every minute the fog looks
like its good for a week lets do some-
thing

  but morton shook his head

  you fellows give me a pain he said
if were in the upper bay blowing the
whistle will only bring the rebels down on
us and if were on our side we will be
laughed at for a bunch of boobs be game
and stick it out

  thus appealed to the engineer gave up
and went back to wiping his engine with a
piece of waste

  keep that dog quiet or choke him
ordered morton as arab strained forward
over the bow with a low growl

  the dogs keen ears had caught the sound
of a stealthy oar and fifty yards in front


adventure

of them the ghostly shape of a native
dugout appeared after being challenged
and allowed to advance under cover of the
crews revolvers the boat contained only
two harmless-appearing native women with
a scanty assortment of fruit which they
held up for sale

  just like i told you said morton
with assurance weve hit shore some-
where inside our own bay and you fellows
all excited wanting to blow the whistle
and raise ned generally

  then with signs and his scanty supply of
native jargon he bought some of the fruit
and asked that help be sent out from shore
to pull the boat of the black beady eyes
of the two women took in every detail
of the boats predicament and the nature
of its cargo while they shrugged and chat-
tered and seemed to try to make out
mortons instructions then abruptly they
disappeared in the fog

  morion was well pleased with himself
there seemed a good chance now of getting
the boat off the reef and the cargo safely
ashore without having to ask for help with
its embarrassing explanations from the
ship but the rest of the crew were not so
optimistic smith at least was uneasy
for arab gave almost constant signs of the
presence of enemies

  smells some dog ashore said morton
but smith did not answer the thrust
for arab had run to the other end of the
boat away from shore and seemed puzzled
and disturbed as they watched from near
at hand in the fog bank came a dozen rifle
shots and two of the bullets went through
the launchs canopy a few seconds after-
ward from the other side of the boat but
further off came a like fusillade of shots

  theyre all around us said fatty
walters as he and the fireman strapped on
their revolver belts and crouched down in
the waist of the boat the other members
of the crew were already armed guess
theres no argument now about where we
are or what were up against

  theyll hear the shots out on the ship
said morton hopefully

  youre a bum guesser said the engi-
neer get busy with the whistle cord
like you should have long ago firing dont
mean anything to the ship somebody is
always doing a little shooting on shore
smith and arab had taken their places
for defense in the stern of the boat behind

the ammunition cases with jimmy wood
the sternman while the coxswains place
was in the bow

  as morton took the whistle cord to
commence his belated signaling the first
of the attacking canoes was so close in to
the bow that he had to let go and crouch
in the cockpit again as he emptied his
revolver to repel boarders two natives
armed with rifles fired rapidly from the
small boat while their craft was sent
swiftly along by two other men at the oars
canoe after canoe did this

  the launch crew would catch a fleeting
glimpse of a boat as it came in sight and
vanished in the fog and get in a few shots
at each moving target some of which were
hits while the natives seeing the larger
bulk of the launch better riddled the
canopy and smokestack and upper sides
with bullets

  one of these shots going too high to do
any damage to the boats crew proved a
luckier chance blow for the attackers than
if it had struck a man for it took overboard
the small brass steam whistle secured to the
smokestack and destroyed the launchs
only means of communication with the
gloiister the fireman cursed mortons
stubbornness in not using the whistle sooner
as he shut off the valve to stop the escaping
steam and at the same time the natives
changed tactics and rushed the launch from
all sides at once

  despite the best efforts of the defenders
they seemed determined to take the boat
by storm thinking perhaps that the quick
move of the fireman and the hiss of steam
meant disaster but at close range the
deadly automatics of the five sailors were
terribly effective as they stood up at their
places and emptied the revolvers as swiftly
as they could push in the fresh clips

the attack collapsed but not until
the defenders had paid their toll as
well jimmy wood had a bullet
in the left shoulder morton had a nasty
head wound from a splinter of the deck
planking and a bullet had plowed across
the engineers cheek in a deep painful
furrow smith and the fireman had es-
caped

  i dont want many more like that
said walters as he sank wearily into his
seat by the engine and let the fireman tie
on a first-aid bandage
off the course



  smith was busy with wood while morton
managed to bandage his own wound

  the ships bound to miss us and send
a rescue party said the fireman hopefully

  sure answered the pessimistic engi-
neer shell wait an hour at least for a
report from shore and then shell wireless
in after that when they locate the co
the landing party will make a report then
theyll begin to get busy and then get ready
and then start where do you think theyll
go whos going to put them next to
where we are in this fog theyll have to
find us before they rescue us

  weve got to hold on said morton
until they do come

  you can bet its hold on agreed the
engineer you know what happens to a
poor boob thats captured by these spig-
goties

  we might signal with revolver shots
suggested smith maybe they could pick
the shots out now that its quiet again
its a bright scheme said morton
sarcastically what made it take you
so long to think of it but jar your brains
a little at three miles the sound would
be mighty faint even if they caught it at all
and we would have to repeat it over and
over and not be interrupted by any shots
from another point while we were doing it
then you know he continued making the
explanation childishly simple so that smith
would get the full back-kick from his
blunder even if the stern sheets is full
of ammunition you dont see any rifles
aboard do you and all the revolver
ammunition we have is whats left in our
belts any more brilliant suggestions

  a soft bump against the launchs side
interrupted further talk the men leaned
over the side with pistols read but only
an empty native boat had bumped along-
side it was a third full of water and its
blood-stained thwarts gave evidence of what
had happened

  i didnt think they would tackle it again
for awhile said morton with relief as he
dropped his automatic back into its holster

  i remember that boat said the fireman
as the dugout began to drift away because
it was such a small one one man was
firing and one rowing they got in close
and jimmy wood got them both before they
fixed him

  smith took a boat-hook and pulled the
craft alongside the boat seemed un-

damaged and this discovery had suggested
a plan he ignored mortons growl to let
the boat alone and turned to the fireman

   what do you use for a bailer he asked

  whatre you up to challenged morton

  wait and see said smith turning on
him furiously but dont try to stop
me

  morton had provoked his temporary
bowman to the limit and the same smith
who had come to the defense of his dog
and who had refused to let the coxswains
sarcasm and criticism keep him from making
suggestions for the welfare of the boat faced
him now defiantly ready to fight if he had
to to carry out his plan

  im the boss here temporized morton
im the coxswain

  lets not argue cut in smith it
was your pig-headed stubbornness in going
on without a compass that got us into this
fix im going to bail out this boat and
go after help its the quickest way to tell
the ship that were in trouble and where
we are

  with the firemans tin bucket which he
used to scrub clothes smith let himself
carefully down into the small boat and
began to empty it of water

  let him go said morton to the engi-
neet these spiggoties are all around
us thick laying for a move like this what
the coward is thinking of is a chance to get
away with a whole skin himself

  smith had straightened up his task
finished and heard the last remark

  you go then he offered morton re-
straining the hot words which came to his
lips but leaving his fists clenched cant
you see that if we dont use this chance to go
for help it means not only death to us but
to dozens of our shipmates if the natives
capture the ammunition who goes doesnt
make any difference just so somebody
does go

  his earnestness had an effect on morton
who answered sullenly

  the chances are better here theyre
sure to get anybody that makes a dash for
the ship your best chance is to stay and
fight it out with us

  ill go then said smith as he un-
strapped his ammunition belt and handed
it over ill keep whats in the gun
he said

  then giving the word to the eager
airedale who jumped down beside him


adventure

smith took up the paddle and shoved
silently off into the gray wall of fog

  in half a dozen strokes the launch had
disappeared and paddling silently smith
headed in obliquely toward shore his
plan was to let the shore-line guide him to
the outer point and from there head for
the ship letting the run of waves outside
determine his general direction and hoping
by this means to strike somewhere near
enough to hear some sound from her like
the striking of the bell or the calling of an
order watching for a glimpse of the
steep sandy beach or the faint outline of a
tree or shrub smith failed to give enough
attention to the growing uneasiness of arab
a growl warned him and he looked aside to
where the dogs muzzle pointed

  out of the fog came a native canoe a
large one with four paddlers and two rifle-
men they saw smith even before he
saw them and a challenge rang out for
the fog had turned both natives and white
man into gray shapes without identity
smith was afraid to answer for fear his
voice would betray him and as if he did
not hear he kept on obliquely past the other
canoe but the challenge was repeated and
the larger boat moved forward to block
his course seeing that discovery was un-
avoidable smith opened fire sending the
six shots from his automatic into the center
of the crowded boat and then paddled
ahead feverishly

  the natives had not been sure that the
small boat contained an enemy and were
anxious to save their scanty store of ammu-
nition besides not wanting to betray their
position in the ring of boats that encircled
the launch the heavy revolver fired at
close range killed the rifleman in the bow
who fell forward across the gunwale giving
the boat an ugly list wounded two of the
paddlers and so confused and handicapped
the second rifleman that smiths boat was
disappearing into the fog before he could
free himself from the body of the paddler
who had fallen backward acrpss his legs
put his weight on the light side of the boat
to keep it from capsizing and fire

smith was bending low paddling
with all his strength a bullet came
through the thin side of the boat
just above the waters edge and another
seared his back like the stinging cut of a
vicious whip the native for a rarity

was a good shot and only the fog saved
smith as he whirled the boats head
into a new course to offset the riflemans
aim he realized that the man could no longer
see him or the boat and hurried away from
the angry smack of the bullets in the water
around the spot where he had disappeared

  the native boat with its dead and
wounded and a hole in the bottom the size
of a mans thumb where one of smiths
bullets had been deflected and tore end
over end instead of boring through could
not give chase and following the shore-line
smith made the mouth of the bay and
headed for the ship

  fortunately for his cockle-shell the sea
was smooth there only being enough
motion in the gentle swells to give him
direction there was no wind the fog
still lay a damp enveloping pall over every-
thing from his watch smith knew that
he had been away from the launch less than
fifteen minutes and since there had come
no sound of shots or of a struggle behind
him he knew that the jumping jack with
its crew and cargo was yet safe

  roughly from the point of land to the
ships position was about two miles and
paddling steadily smith took up his muscle-
and-nerve-trying task not only must he
paddle with all his strength but to keep
his direction he must watch constantly the
roll of the sea and pay no attention to the
disconcerting influence of the fog he
hoped to make it in half an hour he must
make it he told himself or it would have
been better if he had stayed to help in the
defense of the launch

  at the end of fifteen minutes he stopped
to listen weirdly and faintly as if it
might be imagination he caught the strik-
ing of five bells

  were going back to the ship he said
to the dog do you get me arab old
man

  in answer the dog whined understand-
ingly and thrust up his nose to take
smiths caressing strokes

  wheres the ship arab said smith
an idea coming to him and the dog ran to
the bow and leaned over letting out a little
yelp of eagerness good boy said
smith and repeated back to the ship
arab back to the ship as he took up the
paddle to commence his work again

  the crease across his back was beginning
to burn and stiffen and from behind him
off the course



shoreward had come an intense outburst of
firing but whether from the vicinity of the
launch or from some other point ashore
he was unable to determine then came
a danger which he had not counted on
the next native boat in line from the one
he had run foul of had rushed in at the
sound of firing found the disabled boat
and followed from where he had disap-
peared in the fog

  not the zigzag course around the shore-
line but straight out to the mouth of the
bay to head him off in his dash for the ship
by chance he had eluded them there
but knowing the direction of the ship and
thinking that the sailor would now take a
straight course they came swiftly after
being guided finally by the sound of smiths
inexpert paddling

  arabs stiffening bristles and his interest
at the stem of the boat warned smith of
the presence of enemies soon he as well
as arab caught the sound of the pursuing
boat so close that it was only a question
of minutes until it would be near enough
for the natives to see him smiths only
chance to dodge was while still hidden
in the fog and dipping his paddle with as
little noise as possible he turned abruptly
to one side and after a dozen strokes quit
paddling to listen

  the native boat went by so close that he
could hear the suck of the paddles and the
slap of the bow against the water and then
no longer hearing him as a guide ahead
of them smith heard a half-toned order
and the native boat stopped also so that
the keen ears of its occupants could pick
up the trail again

  smith was afraid to paddle afraid almost
to move and arab stood motionless beside
him restrained from all soimd by his
masters stroking hand his presence gave
smith a plan of action with the point
of his jack-knife he scrawled on the dogs
brass collar help launch upper bay
and that done he bent over and putting
command and faith and entreaty into his
tone whispered softly into arabs ear-

  go to the ship

  the dog seemed bewildered for a moment
and so smith lifted him carefully and placed
him over the side into the water then
he pointed and again whispered his order
commandingly almost harshly and the
dog with one glance backward to make sure
commenced swimming ahead

  go to the ship repeated smith with
his lips and arab looked back one more
time to catch his masters hand waving
him on

  then-noisily smith took up the paddle
and commenced to row in the other direc-
tion immediately from the fog came the
answering swish of water as the native
boat came after him

  smith knew that free from interference
the dog would make the ship and he pad-
died shoreward long enough to make sure
that arab was not discovered before he
dodged again this time the natives were
close enough to see him he turned the
little boat swiftly and by a desperate effort
regained the shelter of the fog the
natives were too close to the ship to risk
the alarm of gun-fire and preferred a more
silent method of disposing of the mes-
senger

  smith felt this and with the growing
distress from his wound knew that he
could not hope to dodge the larger boat
much longer so while still hidden he aban-
doned the boat preferring to take his
chance by swimming and floating with the
tide toward the ship than to fall into the
hands of the natives

  to help keep afloat he took both the
boats paddles he was just in time for
safe in the fog bank he heard the two
boats scrape together and the contention
of excited voices the firing on shore
had broken out afresh smith floated on
his back afraid to make strokes for fear
the splashing would betray his position
and planned to dive under the surface
if he heard the boat coming nearer the
argument continued

  part of the natives wanted to con-
tinue the search for the swimmer while
the others stimulated by the shots ashore
and disgusted with the fruitlessness of
their chase wanted to get back into the
attack on the launch

  this faction won out and smith heard
the sound of a hatchet as the bottom of
the small boat was smashed in and then
the sound of paddling growing fainter as
the boat went shoreward cautiously he
swam back toward the wrecked boat and
after a search which left him exhausted
threw his tired body across its sunken edge
for though destroyed for the use of a paddle
there was enough buoyancy left in the wood
to keep him afloat


adventure

dick reasoner was seeing to
the adjusting of a side-cleaners
stage when a moving spot out on
the fog-wreathed water attracted him he
rubbed his eyes and beckoned to slim
higgins

  whats a seal doing six thousand miles
away from home he demanded

  where asked slim trying to follow
reasoners pointing finger and then dic-
tionary dick made a wild dash toward the
gangway

  its arab he flung back over his
shoulder and swimming with just his
nose out like he was about done for

  a moment later he was helping the dog
aboard where safe on the lower platform
arab stood up and shook himself before
he followed dictionary dick up the ladder

  whats up old boy asked reasoner
stroking his wet head something wrong
with the launch

  arab turned back toward the gangway
and spoke the only language of entreaty
he knew-a low whine

  if smith sent a message arab must
have lost it said higgins nothing is
tied to his collar

  maybe theres something under it
answered reasoner and unbuckling the
iet leather he took it off for a closer look
the fresh scratches on the brass name plate
attracted him

help launch upper bay

  meanwhile the first lieutenant had
become uneasy at the launchs late return
to be half an hour-late from slow running
to and from shore in the fog was reasonable
but when the launch was an hour overdue
he wirelessed an inquiry ashore to make
sure there was no mistake each person in
authority including the commanding offi-
cers of the blue-jackets and marines and
their supply departments was notified
before a reply was made and when it did
come bearing undeniable proof that the
launch had gone astray the first lieutenant
consulted the captain and then ordered
the reserve landing party called away

  the bugles commenced their shrill calls
to cast loose and provide lower all
boats and away landing party just
as dictionary dick made his discovery of
the message on arabs collar

  good cried the first lieutenant as
reasoner handed him the collar this

tells us where to go at once without any
blindmans buff in the fog the dog
ought to have a medal grab a squad out
of the first and second divisions well
take the second steamer and let the slower
boats follow as they get away get me
the compass course for the upper bay
he told the officer of the deck and see
that every boat has it before they shove off

to the men on the launch the
second attack had come and failed
but had left them with only the
revolver ammunition which their guns held
the unlucky jimmy wood had received
another wound but propped among the
ammunition cases he refused to give up
the second attack had been better planned
than the first and the natives had kept
further away so that they had suffered
less while the launch crew used more
ammunition and made fewer hits

  here comes one of them with a white
rag on a paddle announced walters
what do you say i take a shot at him
i dont trust these fellows white flag or
not

  let him come on advised morton
and the native boat came close enough for
conversation

  from a quick flow of words from this
native morton interpreted the command
vamose no kill or words to that effect

  i dont get you said morton in the
native tongue

  with gestures the native repeated his
offer

  he wants us to beat it and leave the
ammunition interpreted the engineer
he says theyll let us go away safely

  nothing doing said jimmy wood
i dont trust him and what are we going
to get away in anyhow you know what
they did to the marine sentry they caught

  i dont know fellows hesitated mor-
ton it looks as if it might be our only
chance if theyd furnish us boats theyre
bound to get us-

  he was interrupted by an outburst of
firing and bullets began to screech and
sing through the canopy as the men dodged
down with their attention directed to
the man with the flag of truce it was too
good an opportunity for a surprise attack
for the natives to miss

  i got that one anyhow said jimmy
wood as the man with the rag on his
off the course



paddle stooped to pick up a gun from the
bottom of the boat and lurched overboard

  from all about them the attack developed
with new fury and the sailors carefully
hoarding each cartridge fired only when
an actual hit seemed probable with the
slacking of resistance the attacking boats
grew bolder and came in closer riddling
the upper part of the launch with bullets
while the sailors crouched on the bottom
with almost empty revolvers waiting for
the rifle-fire to cease and the end to come
morton had rifled the boat box for the ax
while the engineer put his trust in a heavy
wrench and the fireman in a short slice bar

  here they come cried jimmy wood
taking a firmer grip on the heavy spare
tiller which he had taken from its rack
under the seat and firing the last of his
cartridges at the leading boat

  echoing his words came the shrill call
of a steam launchs whistle and the despera-
tion in woods tone faded out instantly

  shout he cried all together its
help from the ship

boat ahoy the men called and were
answered by another blast from the whistle

  the natives fired a last scattering volley
and at a command from the leader paddled
shoreward to where the fog bank let down
its sheltering wall again the launch sig-
naled and guided by shouts from the
boats crew soon came in sight

  were on a reef cried morton dont
get too close

  a few minutes later the boats under oars
began to arrive and while some of them
guarded against another attack the launch
was lightened of its load of ammunition
and pulled off the reef by a line from the
other steamer then the belated cargo
of ammunition was sent around the point
to its destination the guard boats were
called in and the rescuing expedition
started back to its ship

  dick reasoner was worried about his
friend singleton smith he had con-
fidently expected to find him in the rescued
launch and jimmy woods story of what
had happened did not reassure him

  we heard shooting soon after he put
off said wood thats when they done
for him but its a blessing he was game
enough to send the dog on to deuver the
message a few minutes more and that
bunch of spiggoties would have had enough
ammunition to last em a year besides

he smiled grimly the glouster would have
been shy five men instead of one

  well fan out as we go back instructed
the first lieutenant im hoping yet we
will find smith alive and if we do hes to
be coxswain of the launch im disgusted
with morton

  reasoner was afraid to hope the
chances against smith looked too big
but he remembered now the queer actions of
arab as the second steamer came ashore
the dog had been all eagerness and yelped
with joy from his place on the bow as they
started but when a few hundred yards
away from the ship had suddenly leaped
overboard on an errand of life and death
the boat had no time to stop for him

  hell make it back to the ship said
slim higgins hes all worried because
he cant find hobo

  the boats reached the ship with the
problem unsolved and there found single-
ton smith safe in a cot in the sick bay with
aral stretched out on the deck beside him
sound asleep to the dogs keen instinct
smith owed his life for lying across the
sunken boat paddling with his hands in
the direction of the ship-he had lost the
paddles-he was so near unconsciousness
from exhaustion that when the launch
passed near him on its way ashore he could
be heard by the men

  but the supersensitive ears of the dog
had caught his masters voice and the
coming of arab gave smith fresh courage
as they drifted and paddled nearer the ship
arab barked loudly for help and finally
guided the dingey to them when rescued
arab stood up to his neck in the hollowed-
out boat and smith was barely breathing

  dictionary dick tiptoed to the sick bay
door with a blanket over his arm it was
unneeded for the hospital apprentice had
already wrapped the wet airedale in one ol
his own and reasoner went away wiih his
finger on a word in his little dictionary slim
higgins caught him scratching his head

  reward he said grinning whats
the matter with that

  fine said reasoner but where does
arab come in how are we going to
reward him

  thats carrying the thing too far
said slim higgins try him with a piece
of fresh meat doggone the dictionary
if it aint practicable arab would say him-
self if he could talk
the twelve
padlocks by

carroll kmickener

author of the woman of the desert

t he carleton had a habit of
being crowded at the dinner hour
so at tiffin i bribed the blue-
gowned no x boy to reserve me a
table i am fussy i confess i do not like
to wait for a table and i do not care to dine
vis-a-vis with a stranger who perhaps takes
his soup in an unpleasant manner this is
the result doubtless of being pampered too
long by the obsequious orient

  but i found my table was not reserved
for me after all the stranger who was
established there had without question
outbid me in the matter of cumshaw which
is the chinese name for the species of
brigandage we denominate the tip
boy i inquired in exasperation why-
for you no have reserve table

  yes mahstah no have reserve he
responded smilingly with characteristic
chinese indirectness

  why-for-why-for i persisted though
i knew well enough how futile it was to
expect a direct answer

  not on account of any reason mah-
stah the boy assured me seriously leav-
ing me to adjust myself if possible to the
situation and to the stranger

  queer fish these chinks volunteered
the man at my table he was irreproach-
ably though unpleasantly because of my
irritation partaking of his soup his
accent advertised him for an american-in
fact i should have known him for a fellow-
countryman by no more than the cut of his
clothes and the angle of his chin he had
the weathered look of an ex-soldier combined
with the appearance of having been long

ennuied by the exotic life of the east

  there was a subtle quality about his eyes
that seemed to reflect evidence of much
travel in many and diverse lands that un-
mistakable quality lurks somewhere about
all much-traveled persons there was a
trace of dissipation in his face-or perhaps
it was only the souvenir of oriental fevers
he looked withal well seasoned to the
east

  i made no answer to his introductory
remark i was feeling much too uncivil
but apparently he took no notice there
are people-born salesmen they must be-
who cannot be rebuffed he talked on
until i was compelled either to reply or beat
a retreat and in the end he won me over

  of course he was saying it was all a
matter of cumshaw i offered him more
than you did he could not foresee any-
thing like that when he promised to reserve
the table for you therefore he would
argue-if he could argue-that he could not
be expected to hold to an agreement that
turned out to his disadvantage not
anglo-saxon logic is it but what interests
me more is the chinese habit of indirection
they wont approach any subject in a
straight line

  you heard the answers the boy gave you
neither one responsive ah theyre diffi-
cult to understand-and crafty but
theres another characteristic-their super-
stition-that knocks their craftiness clean
out we foreigners never will fathom the
chinese well enough to beat them at all
points of the game but we can always get
them on this weak spot-their superstition
the twelve padlocks



i happen to have a case in mind that fits
the theory-

  he paused to glance at me apprehen-
sively

  youre not bored he asked so
many people out here are bored you know
one never knows youd rather not hear
me chattering

  i could see that his inquiry was made not
so much with an eye to my real convenience
as to insure my attention i gave him a
shake of the head and he went on at once

  im from inland you know-and i must
talk we chaps from up-river have to talk
to a white man occasionally or wed go
insane think of it man months in a
reeking interior city without railroads
without electric lights without any visible
reminder that youre in the twentieth
century and not in the sixteenth no white
face for months at a time

  when we get a furlough-and the com-
panys none too generous on that score-it
usually comes just in time to save our
sanity we take the first boat down-river
for the coast now here i am just in an
hour ago on a steamer that carried four
hundred and seventy-five chinese farmers
their loquacious wives their bleating goats
their quacking ducks and their enormous
bundles

  there was only one other white man on
board and we talked each other completely
out we probably would have done some
mutual knifing over our own beer in another
night on board and now that im here ive
got to talk to some one-to a white man
thats what ive come eight hundred miles
for after a penal servitude or solitude of
eight months

  but i started to tell you about these
crafty chinese their only weak point is
their superstition i maintain and thats
how a clever white man can get the best of
them this case i have in mind is a queer
one a fiction writer might make it into a
story he could call it the twelve pad-
locks its about a friend of mine-well
call him andrews-and a bunch of very
clever but very old-fashioned chinese
merchants i believe there was even a
magistrate among them it cant do
andrews any harm to tell you this even
though hes an american and you are in the
consular service

  oh i dont need to be told that-i
would have guessed it even if the no  boy


here hadnt told me but the case probably
hasnt been brought to your attention it
probably wont be the crafty old chinks
that lost their four hundred thousand dol-
lars to this andrews chap arent going to
lose a million dollars worth of face by
taking their troubles to the american con-
sular service

  i suppose youve been out here long
enough to discover how suspicious and dis-
trustful the chinese are no one really
trusts anybody the son mistrusts his
father and father suspects son business
partners dont trust one another of course
this characteristic is being modified con-
siderably in the treaty ports where the
chinese come in business contact with
foreigners thats evident from the growth
of the native banking business but there
are still big communities in china that
wont keep their money in a bank

  this was the case with the merchants in
a walled city where andrews was stationed
by his company-british-american tobacco
you may have guessed there was a big
chinese hong there-pottery firm-that
must have had an annual income of half a
million do you suppose the directors
would do business with a bank they
would not the twelve fat whiskered
silk-coated old rascals kept the company
funds in a huge iron box locked with
twelve old-fashioned padlocks each had
his own padlock and business couldnt
be transacted unless all twelve were present
to perform the rite of opening the safe

  i had mellowed a bit toward the stranger
or rather i had become resigned to him
at this point i even asked some more or less
intellingent question by way of expressing
interest

  i suppose he explained its a good
deal like this these twelve old boys were
all honest enough-with one another
they must have been or they wouldnt
have hung together for so long but the
collection of padlocks was designed not so
much for protection against one another
as for protection to themselves from all
suspicion of dishonesty

  in a country where every one suspects
some one it is necessary to take even such
a ridiculous precaution as that to avoid the
finger of suspicion if the safe was robbed
they figured no one of them could be
blamed since it would have required all
twelve to get it open
i

adventure

andrews shared warehouse
space with the pottery hong in
fact his offices were practically iden-
tical with those of the chinese outfit the
big iron box with the twelve padlocks stood
in a room where it was always visible to
andrews it was so large-so he told me-
that the room must have been built around
it the door was not large enough to have
let it through

  no great attention was given to guard-
ing this treasury there were watchmen
on duty at the warehouse but i fancy the
twelve directors put their faith largely in
the great strength of the box and in the
imposing cluster of padlocks

  id better tell you something about this
andrews i guess cant do him any harm
because andrews is not his real name and
theres probably lots of salt water by this
time between china and the place where
hes enjoying that cool four hundred thou-
sand andrews was a reformed yeggman
youll agree with me such a thing is
possible not the ordinary sort-dont
think of him as the lingo-talking jailbird
kind you read of in the fiction

  he had an education and what he
didnt get in school he got from a woman-a
decent woman what put him into the
yegg business theres no good asking
probably hes not telling why should he
he worked mostly along the california
coast the san francisco police would re-
member him yet for several little jobs
theyve never been able to clean up but
andrews squared for them in a way by get-
ting into a uniform in the spanish-amer-
ican war he served in the philippine
insurrection and later in the constab-
ulary

  then he drifted about the china coast
for a while in various more or less respect-
able occupations-all of them at any rate
just short of his old vocation of lock pick-
ing there were times when he might have
gone back to it but he managed to stick his
reform resolution out

  well you can see what a trial that old
iron box in the pottery hong was for an-
drews it offered so easy a job it was
ridiculous in twenty minutes he could
have filed a master key that would unlock
all twelve padlocks he hadnt cracked a
safe in a mighty long time and his ethics
were pretty good but that strong box was
a cruel temptation he wavered many a

time and twice he filed keys that would

have done the job

  once he went so far as to open the box
while the chinese watchman dozed outside
in the compound he fingered the packets
of chinese bank-notes curiously these old
merchants pinned their faith to banking
currency though they avoided the banks as
depositaries two things at first helped
andrews over the temptation genuine
honesty and a bit of wholesome fear on
the one hand the habits of his recent years
of semi-decency held him back and on the
other hand his knowledge of how difficult
it would be for him to get away with his
booty

  there were several hundred miles of
slow river travel between him and the coast
his sudden departure would put him under
suspicion and concealment of the money
would be next to impossible nothing can
be concealed among the chinese there
are no secrets if he should carry off the
contents of the box the robbery would be
discovered a few hours afterward when
the directors gathered for the daily cere-
mony of removing the twelve padlocks
then the hue and cry would be down upon
him

  andrews used to tell me how comical
it was to watch the twelve directors
assemble for the unlocking ritual it
was better than anything hed ever seen
in comic opera but its very openness-
its childish simplicity-seemed to be the
greatest security of the strong-box system
a chinese yeggman might have been equal
to the situation but andrews wasnt

  but by and by there came a sudden
event that made it very easy for andrews
to fall one of the twelve directors died
custom decreed that a new director could
not be elected until after the funeral of
the deceased it was the superstition
that if the deceaseds key should be used
before the formal election of a successor
the spirit of the dead man would be jealous
and cause the users death do you see
how it was the strong-box on that
account had to remain closed and business
be hanged until after the funeral

  no man could possibly be found-least
of all among the directors-who would
have braved the superstition of meeting
death if he grated the dead mans key
in its padlock the best the directors
could do would be to consult the taoist
the twelve padlocks



priests and bribe them into picking an
early auspicious date for the funeral
you know how those things are arranged
the priests if they were greedy enough
might hold them up for many days before
they completely exhausted the directors
patience

  andrews knew all this and he wasted
no time in listening to his conscience
the funeral he figured couldnt take place
decently inside of two weeks robbery
of the strong-box therefore couldnt be
discovered until after the thief was too far
away to give chase

  well to be brief about how the affair
turned out the doubled guard posted
that night at the warehouse saluted him
respectfully and without suspicion as he
left late in the evening after burning much
kerosene over ostensible office work care-
lessly protruding from under his desk was
a suitcase into which he had transferred
all the portable valuables in the iron
strong-box he left thet welve ridiculous
padlocks dangling from the bolt of the big
safe just as if they never had been touched

  two days later while the eleven sur-
viving directors were still engaged in
frantic negotiations with the taoist priests
for the setting of a date for the funeral
andrews pulled the suitcase from under his
desk and boarded a river steamer for
shanghai

  of course ive never heard the end of
the story we can only imagine that

   picture the old silk-capped pottery mer-
chants escorting to the strong-box with
its silly padlocks their newly-elected asso-
ciate entrusted legally with the deceaseds
key imagine them opening it up and
finding nothing inside but a few bars of
silver too heavy for andrews to pack away
delicate isnt it

  the stranger chuckled at this thought
he seemed tremendously pleased-more
so than he ought i reflected-over this
moral lapse of his friend for my part
 could see nothing extraordinarily clever
in andrews coup it was very simple
i thought and said so

  the stranger was silent for a moment
regarding me anxiously he wore the
expression of a child that has been cutting
capers for admiring applause only to
receive the reproving and unflattering
glances of his elders before he could
reply a hawaiian orchestra struck up one

of the plaintive tropic-island melodies
and my companion directed his attention
eagerly to the performance a look of
unmistakable nostalgia came into his face
as he listened

  that music has a great effect on me
he remarked when the orchestra had
finished it always makes me homesick
ive seen a good deal of the islands coming
and going theyve come to mean some-
thing peculiarly like home to me though
ive never lived there i suppose its
the sort of homey melody of the hawaiian
songs that does it they make you think
of old times and old places how does
the poetry go about that old unhappy
far-off things and memories long ago
that isnt correct i know but thats the
general idea have you ever felt that
way

  he enlarged on this point almost to the
degree of irrelevance and then suddenly
reverted to the padlocks

  what do you think-tell me frankly
he asked of andrews little stunt do
you blame the poor fool very much
remember all ive told you about him
there he was marooned among a lot of
yellow aliens thousands of miles from
home-if he had any place he could call
homeland thats it you see-he was only
a poor bit of driftwood likely to end his
days with a touch of cholera or by means
of strong drink in some odd corner of this
dirty old country

  do you blame him very much for falling
down on his good resolutions for violating
the best traditions of the service and
taking a chance that would put him forever
beyond his miserable existence here he
could go home you see-probably has
he could settle down to an honest life for
the rest of his days

  he could afford that i remarked with
unnecessary dryness i suppose

  i guess youre right the poor fool
would never even be able to justify himself
to himself he has been in the service
hes been a soldier you understand what
that means and hes had these few years
of honesty since then all that would make
it hurt more his conscience would be a
hell for him-it would be damnation
and i suppose even now he has begun to
find his money a burden

  hell be careless with it hell gamble
probably and drink thats the worst
lt

adventure

of it he couldnt enjoy it soberly hed
have to drink it up maybe something
worse-hop for instance its sure to
ruin him in the end hell never get any
good out of it the poor fool-the poor
imbecile

the orchestra was playing again
a medley of familiar home songs
the stranger forgot his food in the
intensity of his listening then at the end
of the medley came a strain of dixie
and the star-spangled banner there
was only a bar of the latter but with a
clatter the stranger got to his feet standing
straight and grave until the notes of the
national anthem ceased i stared at him
scarcely comprehending at first we
civilians before the great war were
insufferable clods in the matter of inatten-
ion to simple courtesies to the flag and
the national air

  others were on their feet in the motley
assemblage that filled the cafe it was a
good deal of an american rendezvous
among them was an officer of the navy
and with him a figure in khaki the
strangers eyes rested on these men with a
proud glow he made a half-movement
to approach them then subsided into his
chair	

  we said no more of andrews but talked
of things nearer to the hour and to his
starved interest we left the cafe together
almost as if we were old acquaintances
my irascibility seemed to have vanished
under his dogged friendliness i would
have taken him to the club or to my rooms
for a cigar and a liqueur but he seemed to
be in haste perhaps  only fancied it
but his hurry seemed to be stimulated by
an incident at the door

  a well-dressed chinese entered as we
came out jostling clumsily against us he
looked keenly at my companion-in fact
he stared apparently the chinese fancied
an acquaintance which was not recognized
by the stranger for he turned away and
stepping hastily into a rickshaw was
whirled away into the confusion of the
street the chinese called out to a man
waiting in the shadow of the doorway
and after a moment of voluble instructions
entered the cafe leaving the other to dash
into the street in the direction taken by
the strangers rickshaw

  i suppose i spent the remainder of the

evening at the club at any rate it was
late when i reached my rooms in the
consular building i stumbled over a
suitcase that stood just inside the door
evidently it had been left there by mistake
for it was not mine it was closed but
not locked and the catches seemed to invite
examination curiosity overwhelmed me
i laid the suitcase open on a table and for
a full minute stood whistling before its
contents it was filled to the brim with
trim packets of chinese bank-notes

  there was no name on the case and i
could find no clue to the mystery of its
presence in my room was it unlikely
that this was the four-hundred-thousand-
dollar loot of the man andrews still
further was it unlikely that my dinner com-
panion at the cafe was himself this an-
drews

  i called my no i boy he shuffled his
way into the room blinkingly and pro-
fessed entire ignorance of the suitcase
he roused all the servants but they were
ignorant likewise i gave them up in
exasperation doubtless some of them
knew all about it but true to character
professed ignorance lest in some way they
should be involved in unpleasantness it
was a sort of first cousin i thought to the
kind of suspicion that inspired the pad-
locks

  i pored over the contents of the suit-
case four hundred thousand dollars
there was no doubt after a rough count
lay before me as i fingered the packets
i began a busy mental process of working
out an explanation it seemed a reason-
able theory that andrews and the stranger
in the cafe were one and the same but
could the presence of the suitcase here
mean a sort of repentance a strange method
of reparation what was i to infer

  should i imply that to me had been
intrusted the task of restoring the loot-
a task that probably might be both dan-
gerous and impossible to him or had he
on the other hand simply put the money
in my temporary keeping intending to call
for it later perhaps he was the subject
of a pursuit-perhaps in danger of capture
or detection he adopted this fantastic
means of hiding his booty in effect then
he made me an accomplice should i
accept such a role or shoidd i return the
money at once to its owners an inquiry
through the consular service doubtless
the twelve padlocks



would discover for me who these owners
were

  on the whole i was inclined to the belief
that andrews repentant had given me this
wordless implied invitation to act as the
purifier of his conscience

  it was too late to trouble the consul
it was too late even to carry the money
to a place of greater security i deter-
mined to sleep with one eye open and
conceal the suitcase beneath the bed

  i slept well over so much treasure but
with both eyes shut it seems in the
morning i found that even the cord with
which i had innocently tied the suitcase
to one of my hands had been snipped
without in the least distracting my slumber
as for the suitcase it was gone

  of course i raged at the servants in a
thorough foreign-devil fashion my
words were such as to express suspicion
the servants grew very sad and patiently
indignant i even went so far as to
threaten dismissal of them all a thing
that did not seem remotely probable
either to me or to them to dismiss
them undoubtedly would be to get a worse
set of servants to keep them might
eventually be the means of solving the
riddle

  it did not appear to me on reflection
that there was anything in particular to be
done about the matter i could only wait
further developments from some source
or other probably from andrews if he
had meant to make me only a temporary
receiver for his loot he would be back again
for it if he had intended its restoration
i probably would see no more of him in
that case i was at something approaching
conscience-clear but if he should return
demanding an accounting of my steward-
ship what sort of conviction would my
explanation carry would he have his
revenge upon me

  it was not entirely in an easy frame of
mind that i dined that evening at my
accustomed table the stranger was not
present nor did he appear while i was
there though i loitered in the uneasy hope
of seeing him

   had begun a stealthy investigation into
the truth of andrews story through
means at my hand in the consular service
it seemed likely i should eventually learn
the remainder of the story of the twelve
padlocks as an afterthought when i

returned home that evening i administered
a bribe to the no i boy it was not a large
bribe and i should not have expected a
large return for it in fact it brought only
another mystery-a pale one scarcely rec-
ognizable at first as anything but accident

  while i dressed next morning i found on
my table a large iron key it was of an
old-fashioned character and bore the
curious trademark of some english maker
i asked the room boy about it but he was
able to express only a mild interest he
either could not or would not venture an
opinion as to its origin or as to the reason
for its being there

  doubtless i should have thought no
more about the key if another had not been
beside it when i arose on the following
morning on the next morning there was
a third and on each succeeding day an
addition until i had half a pound or so of
the clumsy bits of steel and brass cluttering
my table once i bundled them up and
hurled them into the courtyard exasperated
at the mystery they represented the next
morning i was rewarded by finding them
all back again with the usual addition

  suddenly the collection ceased to grow
and of a sudden cursing myself for my
stupidity a solution to the mystery of the
keys flashed upon me i counted them
and as i suspected there were twelve
here then were the keys to the twelve
padlocks

  but this far and no further would the
solution go i had a daily desire to
commit medieval cruelties on my smiling
no x boy who i felt certain knew the
answer to the puzzle i was torn between
this irritation and an impulse to meet his
undoubted terms-a handsome cumshaw
also i began to fear this crafty servant
somewhat there was somewhere in all
this business of the keys and padlocks a
lurking menace-perhaps tragedy

  my inquiry through the consular service
yielded me nothing i could not find even
the habitat of the twelve gray merchants
of the iron strong-box neither did i
encounter andrews nor could i find trace
of him among the numerous haunts of
white men in either the foreign or the
chinese quarters i found those who
knew him but none who had seen him
recently

  at the offices of his firm they had no
knowledge of his arrival from up river


adventure

doubtless i thought he had sailed away
fear might have sped him to this disappear-
ance but i was inclined to stick to my
theory of an eleventh-hour repentance
i had conceived a certain respect for him
that could not wholly be discounted by
his own recital of andrews  moral lapse

the hot season was just coming
on and i slipped away for a week
or two into the hills at mokanshan
when  returned  had almost forgotten the
mystery of the twelve keys i was not
thinking of it at least on the morning i set
out on one of my numerous jade-collecting
excursions into the native city for an
hour or more i browsed about among the
shops of a quarter with which i was familiar

  i was growing a bit tired of the heat the
sweating coolies the stench of sewage and
the ruck of so much crowded unlovely
humanity and would have returned to a
comfortable lemonade and tiffin if it had
not been for the chinese guide that stepped
up and wheedled me into following him to
a new jade shop of which i never had heard
i followed him though i did it reluctantly
for he led me some distance beyond the
streets with which i was familiar he was
a guide i did not recall seeing before and
this did not reduce my reluctance

  we were jostled in the narrow thorough-
fares by shouting coolies assailed by the
cries and stares of filthy street urchins
and followed by the insistent choruses of
disease-scarred beggars we passed down
a long shaded street of violin-makers and
then delved into alleys broken by frequent
puzzling traverses designed to obfuscate
chinese devils that can proceed only in
straight lines at last we came to the
ocher-colored wall of a chinese temple
looking more ancient even than its un-
doubted years because of its leprous
splotches of saltpeter

  i was not surprised to have the guide
lead me inside the temple grounds for
such inclosures usually are lined with shops
but i was disturbed to find the temple yard
deserted weeds grew rankly between
the flagstones of the court and the temple
buildings were in a state of unusual decay
the sun beat down into this desolate
enclosure and the sounds of the teeming city
seemed suddenly remote i had a feeling

of apprehension that made me clutch tenta-
tively at the little revolver i carried-quite
needlessly my friends told me-on such
excursions

  the guide led me rapidly along the shaded
pavilion of vacant shop-fronts to an inner
court here was a slimy green basin that
doubtless once had boasted of being a lotus
pool it seemed to be fed from the tide-
water overflow of a canal the place
recked with heat and miasma i felt sick
and dizzied by the frightful breath of
sewage and the gusts of noon-day sunlight
reflected from the gray tiles of the temple
roofs

  the guide paused significantly and i
followed his gaze to one end of the green
basin where there was visible half in shade
and half in sunlight the iron bars of a
curious enclosure i moved nearer in-
spired by a rising curiosity over something
that moved sluggishly behind those bars
not until i had gazed a full minute upon
the horrible creature visible there did the
meaning of the thing come to me

  i was stupefied by the filth that sur-
rounded him and made his features hideous
by the uncomprehending look of senility
and disease in his vacant eyes by frag-
ments of meaningless parrot-like english
words that dropped from his imbecile lips
the creature was the relic of andrews my
companion at the dinner-table for that
he was andrews i could no longer doubt
from the circumstance of the twelve ugly
padlocks that fastened the iron grate
behind which he rotted

  the guide disappeared i found as with
a murmur of rage-and i will not deny it
of fear-i rushed back through the outer
courtyard in mad haste to bring the keys
that would give liberty to poor andrews

  he still is in the sanatorium in japan
where his tobacco firm generously sent him
but the doctors do not see great encourage-
ment for him his eleventh-hour repent-
ance in the matter of the twelve padlocks
seems to have come-or at least so the
chinese devils appear to have decreed it-
a moment or so too late and i have an
idea that whatever devils were concerned
in the business of clouding his mind had
a fairly intimate working agreement with
the twelve crafty merchants whom andrews
commiserated for their fatal superstitions

hphese are only four out of many of
our writing comrades who are in our
countrys service i often wonder how
we are able to go on getting stories up to
our standard in numbers sufficient to our
needs on the face of things it looks im-
possible but our magazine has been growing
not only in circulation but in the number
of writers who send us stories enough it
seems to keep things nearly normal in spite
of the fact that our writers are particularly
of the type which furnishes men for war
i have no facts for comparison but venture
that our writers have furnished an un-
usually high percentage of men in service

  a nd meanwhile here is that fishing story
we have need in these times of tension
of amusements that temporarily relieve our
minds and nervous systems of the strain
under which labor all of us not too dull to
understand the world-crisis slowly develop-
ing day by day that is why our magazine
is buying even fewer stories with the
atmosphere of the present war than for-
merly so far as we can be of service the
more closely we keep our minds on the war

thebetter but when we have time for
deliberate relaxation and amusement the
more relief we get from the war-strain the
better able well be to carry our end of it
when we turn back from relaxation to work

 at our camp-fire it would be both
foolish and wrong to bar discussion of the
war but we make up the magazine well
ahead as you know and events move too
rapidly for current topics to be still current
by the time written words have reached
you in print what im writing now will
reach you in june but im writing it in
april while all the world is trembling on
the issue of the great hun offensive now
under way yet though its hard to think
of anything else there is nothing i can say
that would have any interest two months
from now no man now knows whether
the germans will be held and bled to death
or whether they will be able to pound their
way through to a victory that would damn
the world for generations and doom it to
years more of warfare on our own soil as
well as on many other bloody fields
probably you will know when you read this
no one knows now what a vast gulf two
months can be

a nd while destiny unfolds we must keep
our balance by meeting the strain
intelligently working as long as we can work
effectively resting and relaxing when we
need to rest and relax for the sake of the
work itself so it is good to go fishing with
harold titus forgetting war a while so
that we may come back rested refreshed
and better able to do each his own part in
the grim task lying to our hands as the
author of this story is himself doing

  i suppose my home town traverse city michi-
gan is the fishingest place they could find with
a search warrant we are located on some of the
best trout water east of the rockies in fact the
boardman river which flows through the town
itself has been one of the remarkable streams of
the great lakes country and we are within easy
	adventure

reach of innumerable rivers that offer splendid
sport a big proportion of the population fishes
too i believe that some of the best fishermen
that ever wore waders call this particular place
home you see we have men here who have
followed the sport through all its phases from the
days when grayling were plentiful until now
when those varieties of trout that will survive warm
waters are being planted in streams which drain
settled country to keep them from being fished out

the catch which i describe in this story is one
which was made by my friend pat hastings
who has hooked his share of em its a dog-gone
good fish story his i mean and may seem a bit
incredible to a novice who reads it but ill vouch
for its adherence to fact two changes i must
mention however the first is that i have moved
the time of the catch forward three or four hours
for the purposes of the plot the other is that the
fish actually taken was not quite as large as the
one in my yarn six-pounders and larger are taken
from this water occasionally but a fact which i
have never had clearly explained is that these
big fish caught after dark do not fight with any-
where near the vigor they display when hooked
in daylight

  it is during the hatch of the caddis fly that the
big browns arc taken from the boardman river
in the greatest numbers the best water is within
fifteen minutes from town by automobile and each
evening during the hatcli of this insect youll see a
representative gathering of liars and fly-fishermen
strung out along the stream trying to get the big
one of the season

fhis river by the way demonstrates what
can be done by restocking to a large
extent it flows through relatively newly-settled
country fifteen or twenty years ago it was alive
with speckled trout but as the timber was cut off
the water warmed and the number of fishermen
increased these fish fell off rainbow were
planted and did fairly well but even then the
sport was mediocre then the state commenced
sending up german brown spawn and now the
boardman shows every sign of reviving and some
regular old-time catches were made last summer
we know that the speckled trout like the grouse
can not stand up under civilization many men
do not like the rainbow although its a sporty
fish the brown however is a noble fighter good
to eat and seems to withstand the clearing up of
streams propagating this variety in quantities is
going to keep rivers stocked indefinitely it seems

ne attractive feature about this part of
michigan is the diversity of water and country
offered we have pond fishing in many places
there are trout streams like the boardman
almost in your dooryard again given a ford
and three hours you can slrike streams like the
manistee or the au sable that last will take an
hour or so longer which run through country as
desolate as any white man could ask for the
upper waters of the manistee are still well stocked
with speckled trout than which no better fish ever
rose to a fly and many other rivers still offer this
particular kind the rainbow predominates else-
where and the brown is fast appearing in waters
hitherto strange to it another interesting fact

is that you can fish say one day in the little platte
river where the speckled trout has a bright steel-
blue cast the next in the rapid where they color
a rich orange with lots of red on the fins and again
in streams farther to the eastward where they get
the pink tint on the belly

  lots of bass too in this country but most of the
natives go nutty over trout and the bulk of the
bass fishing is done by men who come especially
for it-harold titus

od knows where lieutenant dwyer
will be by the time your answer to his
inquiry of january could reach him but if
you know what he asks write him in our
care and well forward to the best of our
ability he was in a u s camp when he
wrote perhaps it would be safer just to
print the answer in the magazine

  wherever i have been among tropical tramps
there is one poem always known it begins thus

     so so youre come to the tropics

    was to be in the shade in a coconut glade
    while the dollars rolled in to you

    you dont go down with a short hard fall

      you just sort of shuffle along
     and lighten your load of the moral code

      till you dont know the right from the wrong

thing may be obtained-richard m dwyer

not the least interesting part of hugh
pendexters stories about our old
indian frontier days is the little chat from
him at camp-fire concerning the history
and real indian customs upon which all his
tales are based

norway maine

  the skidi a tribe of the pawnee confederacy
believed in supernatural animals and located their
underground dwellings or nahurac lodges in the
valley of the loup river nebraska in this belief
of mythic animals holding councils they will remind
you of the cherokee myths guide rock in
kansas was another nahurac lodge

txhen the siouan tribes entered the platte
valley they found the pawnee there hara-
hey was the name of the province which the pawnee
told coronado contained much gold the wichita
country of east-central kansas the confederacy
had no totems and descent was traced through
the mother each tribe had several secret societies
each based on the belief in supernatural animals
one writer gives the time of the last skidi sacrifice
of a human being as  during the first quarter
of the nineteenth century petalesharo a skidi
chief rescued a comanche woman who was bound
to a cross preliminary to being sacrificed and
the camp-fire	

carried her back to her people some four hundred
miles this chief was one of the signers of the
treaty at grand pamee village on the platte in
nebraska october   by the terms of which
they ceded all their lands to the united states
south of the platte river one authority powell
states they were least understood of any of the
important plains indians and this perhaps
because during the seventeenth and the greater
part of the eighteenth centuries they remained
outside the spanish-french sphere of influence
their prowess as warriors is established by their
successful warfare against the many surrounding
tribes-pendexter

when we read on short allowance
i queried mr pladwell about several
points in it in order to be on the safe side
as we often do on our stories my queries
are of no present interest but mr plad-
wells reply to them is worth listening to
the queries can be gathered from the
context they were intended to make sure
of points that might disturb the average
reader not as comments from one wise in
all the technicalities of nautical lore

oakland california

  in the first place the story was a growth of a
query i saw some rotting tubs in oakland
estuary i wondered what might happen if one
of them took a long trip i got some yams from
old salts hereabouts and gradually i evolved the
yarn pieced out of the other yams then when
it was finished i took it to some of the veteran
mariners i have mucked around the water a lot
myself but never on a three-masted schooner so
i needed criticism

  the mariners helped me much and yet not one
of them saw the points that you saw they are
i think debatable

vou will note on the map the long series of
islands of the aleutian group stretching
across the north pacific these islands as a
general rule comprise the northernmost ixmndaries
of the average sailing-ship course across uie western
ocean sometimes prevalent winds drive the
windjammers very dose to the aleutians often
in sight of them the aleutians are bare bleak
islands populated by sea-fowl aleuts beach-
combers seals and occasional wanderers many
a ships crew has deserted to take a chance on
picking up seal illegally around these islands and
while there is not a real settlement on any of the
islands except i think one lone mission church
a crew getting there in a small boat has easy chances
for survival and possibly for profit

for willingness to try such an alternative
the schooner in the story is cheap the food
is awful the master is a martinet the men are
scum with not a first or second class seaman
among them a few days of cheap food and un-
welcome work is enough to make such a collection
of men i think willing to take a chance especially
when a glib-tongued person is stirring up trouble
and putting ideas in the mens heads to make
it more logical i might have put in something saying

big frank had hinted at seal-poaching but as i
said the mariners who saw the story took tliis
desertion so much as a matter of course that it is
safe to assume there is nothing new about leaving
a cheap ship for the thrills of the islands chances

qften in the dreary reaches of the night one
can find helmsmen dozing at the wheel when
the weather is calm why not there is something
about the sleep of a man on the job that does not
let him make many bad slips i have often dozed
myself at the tiller or the wheel but the instant
the boat slewed off her course i set her right auto-
matically she can not fall off very badly without
your knowing it the motion of the ship tells you
now in the story the crew is desperately short-
handed in such a case it would be peculiar
perhaps if the helmsman were not taking a cat-
nap especially with the weather calm at least
he might not be wide-awake enough to observe a
man sneaking up a hatchway from the after-cabin
on a liner a tramp or a big four-master such a thing
as a sleeping helmsman might be serious but not
on that old tub

pvkn on the old scows sailing around san
francisco bay the masters lone helper uses
the sir to the blowsy old bird who happens to
run the tiling but there again my story skids
off the usual with so much to contend with
could the average master induce such a crew of
landsmen to observe this matter without possibly
starting more grief aboard they are landsmen
not sailor-men and yet toward the end of the
voyage i think he would i believe that a few
sirs might not hurt the story and yet ive seen
a drill sergeant in the united states army work
three weeks to make a bunch of rookies say sir
its the hardest word in the united states language
i think-e s pladwell

one of our comrades at the camp-
fire one of the writers of our
stories will no longer gather with
us at our meetings william a shryer is
dead and i know that our sympathy goes
out to the wife and little son he has left
behind him

  born in terre haute indiana mr shryer
has made his home in detroit well
known as a writer on business subjects he
was equally successful with fiction and it
was in the quest for material for future
stories that he met his death the news
came to me from honolulu following by a
few weeks a cheerful letter from him en-
closing a newspaper clipping telling of a bad
fall he had had in the crater of the volcano
march tenth he had preceded his family to
a temporary home taken on the glenwood-
volcano road met them at hilo and on
the return trip met his death in an auto-
mobile accident due to a nut that had
worked loose in the steering gear sending
the car over a sixteen-foot embankment
adventure

  his wife and their japanese maid were
severely injured the boy escaping unhurt
mr shryers neck was broken and he lived
only long enough to tell his wife that he was
done for the body was brought to
honolulu from hilo on the mauna kea and
was cremated

  let us stand and salute him our comrade
for a life bravely lived then wish him god-
speed on the long trail over which we all
will follow

louis esson whose tale the pearl
j of torres you will find in this issue
introduces himself to the camp-fire ac-
cording to our custom

   most australians are wanderers and adventurers
this roving spirit is a racial characteristic for if
their forebears had not possessed it there would
never have been any australia all my prople are
scottish but though i was bom in edinburgh i
was taken to australia as a child and my first
memories are of the big bush an ideal playground
for boys there is an abiding fascination in the
life of the bush with its great spaces its sheep and
cattle and the quaint characters that meet in the
township on market day or for some great sporting
event-a wood chop or race meeting

t dutifully did an arts course at the

  melbourne university studying latin and
philosophy but this brought me little credit with
billy smith the stockman who refused to take me
seriously at cattle droving or even riding--subjects
unfortunately not included in my academic cur-
riculum i wasnt up to the bushmans standard
so  drifted into journalism thence the easy
descent

  i have written for most australian papers and
magazines and worked for a year in london beside
publishing a volume of verse and having a play
produced in melbourne but my best performance
in this line was editing a little daily newspaper on
tie edge of beyond strange types would drop
into the office--we called it the office-drovers
and shearers setting out for far back stations
miners from the coal fields selectors and cockatoo
farmers politicians and what is called the scrub
aristocracy it was an exciting life especially
when the worthy president of a wayback agricultural
society dropped in to interview the staff with a
horsewhip  usually referred him to the manager
a burly man who had been an amateur pugilist in
his early days

t ater on journalism sent me to asia where
i had my fair share of adventure wandering
through many fascinating lands from ceylon to
japan i have seen the dawn rise near darjeeling
over the sacred katchenjunga i have been turned
back from the khyber pass for my own good
i have been in peshawar after a raid by the afridis
and i have seen the beggars and jogis round the
temples at benares the sacred cows and monkeys
and the burning of a body at the burning ghat by
the ganges

  once i traveled from moulmein to bangkok
through burma and siam my traveling com-
panion a forest officer who was going northwards
left me in the middle of siam with much diffi-
culty i obtained a boat and a lao crew who prom-
ised to take me down the menam to paknam-po
this was a terrible journey none of the crew
could speak a word of english and river traveling
was slow stores ran out and for three days there
was no food except what the laos had-gigantic
bananas rice suitable perhaps for elephants frogs
and larvae of bees-impossible even curried at
paknam-po i discovered a friendly englishman
who put on a dinner that would have done no dis-
credit to delmonicos

jyf any australian journalists are scattered along
the asiatic coast from singapore to yoko-
hama among others i met at hong-kong pratt
who has since drifted to bangkok and donald
now representing a new york newspaper both
acknowledged authorities on asiatic affairs

  all australians are deeply concerned in the fate
of the northern territory that lies close to asia
and is perhaps the largest unoccupied territory
in the world today this is our land of romance
a land of pearl and gold of the mirage of our
strange aboriginals a more interesting race than
is usually supposed and of the great bushmen and
adventurers from all the ends of the earth my
half-brother frank brown at present in meso-
potamia chasing turks has been thrice through
the territory studying the elaborate native customs
and making explorations in uncharted country
i have been through it only once but  can never
forget its subtle spell

vet after all there is always romance at home

    before going to new york and london i
spent two years in a cottage only forty miles from
melbourne but the little clearing was cut out
of the virgin forest huge fallen trees and stumps
were round our door and down by the creek an
old man the last of the fossickcrs was still puddling
for gold this bush homestead is at present
occupied by vance palmer who is not unknown
to readers of adventure-louis esson

t y this time-i am writing in may-
i had expected to report considerable
progress by the american league for citi-
zenship inc but ive been ill during most
of x so far and not able to be on my
regular job all the time so work on the
league has had to tread water

  but the prospects are promising and i
expect to have things moving before long
it wa never intended that they should
move rapidly slow and sure and safe
is the better method there need be
no doubt as to their moving when the
time comes i make no other promises
or predictions but before long i hope
to be able to report practical accomplish-
ments	i

employment in india

  question-i am interested in india burma
and tibet can you give me some information on
darjeeling can you give me the name of a news-
paper there

  i am  years old strong and not afraid of work
my line is electricity and machinery-over  years
experience am total abstainer from liquor and
tobacco and can furnish the best of references my
family-my mother sister and myself-wish above
all else to live in a country where we can at least
keep one servant without paying out ones whole
salary to do so

  i understand that employment is difficult to
secure in the far east and that caste conditions
make it impossible for a man to work his way up
from a minor job i appreciate that ask adventure
is no employment agency but i thought perhaps you
might know the names of some firms operating in
those parts

  i will gladly pay you for any information locating
us in india we greatly prefer northern india but
if we cant get there now are going to try hawaii or
japan on account of the servant problem until we

can get to india- - cheyenne

wyoming

  answer by gordon mccreagh-your letter is
one of the very few which i have received in reply

to which i can give some encouragement about em-
ployment in india

  as an electrician and machinist i feel safe in as-
suring you that you certainly could find employ-
ment with one of the big engineering firms on a
salary commencing with about two hundred and
fifty rupees a month-say eighty-five dollars this
sounds frightfully small but im setting a low esti-
mate and the buying power of the rupee in india is
a whole heap more than the dollar here on two
hundred and fifty rupees you could live with your
mother and sister reasonably well and keep three or
four servants-you would have to keep at least that
number because caste laws restrict the duties of each
servant to very definite bounds

  i am sure you would have no trouble in getting
employment but you must of course be prepared
to wait a while till you can locate yourself with
your qualifications a couple of months at the out-
side should see you comfortably settled

  now about darjeeling its a fine place with a
splendid climate considerably milder both ways
than new york situated  feet above sea
level it is a sanitarium city for the wom-out business
men and their families from the tropical plains
you will find there department stores theaters and
high rents but you will not find there a job not
adventure

  

   right away at any rate the reason being that it
   is such a paradise spot-for india-that every
   man in the country spends all his spare time trying
   to land there-and the town isnt so large that jobs
   are many by large i mean commercially large
   there are no mills or manufacturing plants

     your one chance might be in tea tea planta-
   tions spread in all directions along the mountain
   slopes and they employ one or more while men each
   who must have a knowledge of machinery in addi-
   tion to a knowledge of tea you might get in as an
   assistant manager on some garden but pay and
   prospects wouldnt appeal to you for a minute an
   assistant gets about a hundred rupees a month and
   house

     as to a newspaper i dont know how a paper
  will help you and i dont know that i can give you
  the name of one there used to be a small local
  sheet called the darjeeling standard but i heard
  that the war had put it on the fritz people read
  one of the big calcutta dailies the englishman or
  the statesman

     it seems to me that your best course would be to
   ship for calcutta which is the big manufacturing
   center of the country and then look around there
   with your qualifications you should land a job
   without any difficulty particularly since men are
   scarce right now

     the wise thing to do would be to leave your folks
   at home if you can manage it and have them come
   over when you have a job and a little bungalow to
   bring them to the journey is nothing for two
   ladies alone to be frightened at many hundreds
    of english ladies do it every year and for just the
   same reason their men folks have gone on ahead to
    get things started

     if you are not particularly struck on india let me
   suggest burma to you as a field for your future
   rangoon the capital is only three days sail from
   calcutta and while the opportunities for employ-
   ment are not quite so great as in calcutta the scale
   of pay is a half as much again and you will find the
   people very much pleasanter to get along with
   the natives are a vastly more decent race and there
   is considerably less social snobbery among the
   english residents

     burma is a tremendous country and a growing
  one there are oil and lumber and mining com-
  panies all of which could use a practical electrician
  it is worth looking at and the steamer fare from
  calcutta is only about fifteen dollars

     regarding your offer of payment for information-
   this ask adventure service is entirely free and
   adventure magazine is always pleased to have been
   able to be of assistance to its readers if you feel
   that you want to express your appreciation why
   pass the good word along to the next guy

school-ships

     question-i am interested in seafaring life and
   very anxious to learn navigation i have heard
   that there are school-ships that teach this and
   would like to know the names and locations of
   these ships and rules regulations and conditions
   for entering them-f j shymkus east st
   louis 

    answer by captain dingle-the schools for
  merchant marine officers are scattered up and
  down the coast and all are under the supervision

of mr henry howard director of recruiting
custom house boston massachusetts

  from him you can obtain full information

  there was a rule at first which demanded actual
sea experience in an applicant but i believe this
has been waived at least in part and if you write
to mr howard giving particulars of yourself age
physical condition degree of education and so
forth you may be able to enroll without previous
service

  failing this you might apply to the navy de-
partment at washington for the addresses of the
various school-ships taking cadets or apprentices
there is one here the newport and you can also
apply to the commander of her north river new
york

  in these school-ships young fellows are taken in
the raw and trained completely to be officers in a
real ship under sea conditions

  if you fail on all counts write me again but i
think you can get along with this brief information
if you try 

the grand canon of arizona

  question-can you give me any information as
to aztec ruins in the grand canon of arizona i
have heard that their old sacred relics were hid in
there is there any authentic source to this rumor
has the canon ever been thoroughly explored if
so were any minerals found such as copper gold
silver vanadium asbestos what is known alxut
minerals in or near the canon what kind of
game and fish what is the altitude of the moun-
tains there what is the general formation-
granite limestone basalt or lava volcanic or
layer deposit-allen peeler dolores colo

  answer by mr harriman-there are cliff-
dwellings in the grand canon of the colorado at
one point but we do not know that the cliff-dweller
was aztec we can only guess at that with the
probabilities pointing to another race entirely
the aztecs left records that proved authorship
the cliff-dweller did not never heard of buried
aztec relics there save in a novel of lurid and highly
imaginative type

  in the spring of  the canon was partly ex-
plored by lieut ives of u s a eng corps went
up to lower end black canon in steamer explorer
then through black canon in rowboat to las vegas
wash left boat again  miles below joined
ck-train went up east bank to the plateau had
s newberry with him as geologist

   lieut wheeler was sent out by chief of
eng corps explored canon from below in the
fall started from fort mojave went to the mouth
of diamond creek gilbert geologist this trip

  major j w powell made many trips in 
     part up and part down the
canon

  charles s russell of prescott and e r monett of
goldfield both practical miners made a successful
trip julius f slone of ohio with nathaniel
galloway s s dubendorff and r a cogswell went
from green river station wyoming to needles in
boats photographing and examining all the way
emery c and ellsworth l kolb brothers made
same trip to tovar by boat dozens of prospectors
have prospected sections

  there are a few claims that give meager returns in
gold and many fake claims that wouldnt board a
lost trails

burro but are taken up to get a grip on some loca-
tion along the rim that may some day be worth
having i never heard of copper or any other than
gold and gypsum there

  in the forests that cover plateaus at the south and
northeast there are deer bear mountain lions bob-
cats coyotes wild turkeys quail and other small
game trout are found in creeks i do not know
the river fish of the colorado

  el tovar the big hotel of the santa ffi system
stands  feet elevation most of the country is
a series of great plateaus not ridged and peaked as
are our sierras though there are some peaks and



ridges at various distances look across the canon
and you have the impression of a level line though
there are many dips in it

  the country is built up of layer deposits capped
by lava from various volcanic eruptions there
arc many cinder cones mostly red

  one branch canon has extensive deposits of
beautiful marble at other places there are great
stretches of granite a layer of blue limestone
exists  feet below the rim other rocks arc
basalt black gneiss slates quartzites sandstone
and obsidian or volcanic glass thin seams or
layers of iron ore give color to much of the rock
