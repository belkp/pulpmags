chapter i
a subaltern in the south irish
aar must always be the great test
of character no man can go
through the ordeal of ire and
emerge unscathed and to this
truth there are no real exceptions a man
may be made by war or he may be broken
utterly and without redemption but what-
ever happens neither he nor his point of
view will afterward be quite the same
  some men will always be cowards in bat-
tle terror paralyzes their limbs and robs
their minds of all sense of shame merely
to die like soldiers is beyond their strength
this is the one real argument against con-
scription which takes all who are sound of
body rejecting none valuing quantity rath-
er than quality
  others there are who know fear yet con-
quer it the thought of death in all its
manifold forms-by bullet by shell or by
bayonet-is terrible yet far more terrible
is the thought of what men might say were
they to fail when wanted also the man
who turns his back on the enemy has no
greater chance of safety than he who ad-
vances bravely why not then die as a
man should die with honor it is this feel-
ing that makes war possible at all many
things may be forgiven but the one unfor-
givable sin is fear
  but even in these days when science has 
forged instruments of dnction so wicked
that the slaughter of bygone wars is as
nothing compared with the carnage of to-
day there are men who can enter a battle
light of heart seeking danger as the highest
earthly prize within their reach and these
are the men who by sheer indifference to
death snatch victory from defeat
  bravery as a virtue is confined to no one
nation country or creed for that we may
offer thanks but be that as it may no
race under heaven can show such foolhardy
and genuine contempt for an enemy-his

horse foot or guns-as the irish north things in the world that tony mallagh val-
south east or west-belfast dublin cork
or limerick as they were in the past so
are they now prim and joyous lighters-
impatient reckless vengeful-in proof of
which many a hard-fought field in france
and belgium the gossip of trench and bil-
let and the casualty lists bear witness
tony mallagh was a subal-
tern in the south irish this state-
ment should explain a good deal
for the south irish are particular as to their
officers as many a callow youth has learned
to his sorrow and dismay
  in looks and general appearance he was
not unlike any other rather ordinary young
man of six-and-twenty who has spent most
of ms life in the open being lean and wiry
with a good-humored sunburned face and
eyes in which there seemed always to be
lurking a glint of laughter but tony mal-
lagh was not an ordinary young man far
otherwise he had faults of course as
have all of us
  but tony mallaghs faults endeared him
to people no less than his virtues he was
wofully improvident and a spendthrift hav-
ing no sense of the value of money he
bought for the mere pleasure of buying and
mainly for thebeneiit of others an appeal
for his help in either time or cash met
with a ready response he never refused a
friend any request which it might be in his
power to grant he was charitable to a de-
gree of foolishness he lent where there
was no prospect of any return in times
of need taking no thought for the future
he borrowed from a jew money-lender in
london and when funds were more plenti-
ful paid back the debt cheerfully and if
to his mind the rate of interest charged for
the loan seemed exorbitant and out of all
proportion to the benefit received he let it
pass unquestioned an officer of the south
irish could not in common justice to him-
self and his calling stoop to argument over
a matter of borrowed money
  for his poverty however tony mallagh
had no other than himself to thank at
the age of eighteen his mothers brother a
hard-headed ship broker from glasgow had
offered to take him into his business and to
safeguard his interests as if he had been his
only son this offer rejected on the in-
stant lost tony a fair chance of being a rich
man before he was forty but there were
 ued above mere wealth as an alternative
 to amassing a fortune he joined the army
 thereby entering on a career that seemed
 particularly suited to his temperament
   his accomplishments were many and such
 as earned him the respect of his fellow sub-
 alterns he excelled in sport of every de-
 scription he had played rugby football
 for his country he was as good a shot with
 a rifle as any man in the regiment there
 was no horse that he would not ride or at
 least try to and he had boxed as a light-
 weight in the public-school championships
 at aldershot moreover he was absolutely
 without fear and had never been known to
 lose his temper save on one occasion fa-
 mous in the annals of the regiment
   this was soon after he had joined the
 first battalion when he had fought and de-
 cisively beaten a brawny greengrocer in
 commercial road portsmouth simply be-
 cause the said greengrocer being somewhat
 exhilarated by strong drink chose to assert
 his prerogative as a briton by slugging his
 weed of a horse over the head with the butt
 of his whip tony had interfered the
 fight was the natural outcome when the
 greengrocer a head taller and perhaps four-
 teen or so pounds heavier had been count-
 ed out by an enthusiastic crowd of blue-
 jackets and the police had interfered and
 there was every prospect of a fair-sized riot
 being brought about by the losers friends
 and supporters tony had settled the mat-
 ter by offering to purchase the horse and
 wagon on the spot the offer was prompt-
 ly accepted
v this was the reason why ten minutes later
 tonys commanding officer motoring to-
 ward cosham with his wife had been struck
 almost speechless by the spectacle of his
 youngest subaltern barehmld and looking
 slightly the worse for wear seated on the
 front of a dilapidated greengrocers wagon
 with a policeman by his side driving a de-
 jected white horse
   mr mallagh said the colonel in
 mild astonishment mr mallagh may i
 ask-
    its all right sir said tony blandly
  were just taking this old horse to be de-
  stroyed
    but really mr mallagh do you think
 that a greengrocers wagon is er-quite a
 suitable vehicle wouldnt it be as well to
 er-allow the constable to take charge of
lieutenant tony mallagh

the horse alone without your er-valuable
assistance
  fortunately none of the spectators of the
fight knew that tony was an officer in the
south irish fortunately also the colonel
happened to be possessed of feelings some-
what akin to tonys own so the matter
was dropped but so he was told tony
was never to do anything of the kind again
officers of his majestys army must not
fight in the streets as though they were or-
dinary mortals it is not fitting but the
story having leaked out followed tony out
to india and home again when he was trans-
ferred to the second battalion and was re-
lated as typical of himself and his methods
  tony indeed was unpractical a vision-
ary rather given to acting without thought
and apt to be led away by a far-fetched
sense of humor his smile won him friends
where others found only coldness and hos-
tility he made no enemies and his men
adored him also though more or less
poor he was always happy
  for the rest he was irish hailing from
county kerry and in love with the sweet-
est and dearest girl in the world as poor and
as proud as himself who lived with an aunt
the widow of a retired admiral in a small
house at farnborough within easy reach of
the north camp where tony was stationed
in the spring of the year 
  marriage is not a risk to be entered on
lightly for six months tony mallagh
rendered strangely cautious by his good for-
tune waited until such time as his finances
showed signs of improvement but at the
end c  the six months an interminable age
his j atience was worn threadbare the
novelty and charm of being engaged even
though it were to the sweetest and dearest
of girls was slightly dimmed
  as a general rule tony thn- having a
host of friends was disinclined to consult
any regarding his own affairs neverthe-
less he felt now that he needed advice
there was only one man in the whole regi-
ment to whom he could go shannon his
company commander and his senior by
about ten years
  tonys attitude of mind toward shannon
was peculiar he admired him for what he
was and for what he had done as a soldier
he had medals for the tirah expedition in
 the soudan in  the boer war so-
maliland for the northwest frontier six
years before in addition the d s o
earned in natal on the way to ladysmith
he was a disciplinarian b company was
the smartest in the battalion he was sin-
cere kindly clever yet from tony mal-
laghs view-point he had his failings he
was deliberate slow in understanding over
methodical particular as to detail fussy
and as all confirmed bachelors must at last
be old-maidish in his tastes but his judg-
ments were to be relied on he would say
what he thought making no effort to hide
his opinion favorable or not
  so to shannon tony went one morning
after parade and stated his case that
shannon was a man who knew nothing of
women who was commonly reported to de-
spise the sex was no drawback his ad-
vice would be free from prejudice one way
or the other also he knew sybils aunt
and sybil as well
  shannon a big man with black hair and
a small close-clipped black mustache sat in
an armchair smoking a pipe his eyes half-
closed his square-jawed face giving no clue
to what thoughts he might have yet tony
was strangely comforted even by the knowl-
edge that he listened
  so you see how things are sir what
oughc i to do its rotten luck on the girl
you know to be engaged to a fat-headed
chump like i am lord we may drift on
in this kind of way for about fifteen years
or more till im a major if i ever get that
far ill never have any more money than
i have now apart from my pay im cer-
tain and whats that to a girl as ripping
and as good as sybil nothing-nothing at
all i know from-well just from know-
ing her that shed marry me on what i have
now but would it be fair would it be
playing the game
  shannon frowned and looked if anything
rather bored
  shes promised to marry you has she-
some time or other eh
  rather said tony
  said anything to any one
  no sir you see-well weve kept it a
secret for many reasons
  ah and no one knows
  not a blessed soul tony waited won-
dering at the drift of the questions that were
asked of course sir i might try and ex-
change into something thats better paid
than the line the a s c or the army
ordnance for instance or i could get out
to egypt perhaps or west africa or-

adventure
  shannon leaned forward suddenly
  whats that whats that you say
leave the south irish tony youre a fool
you can do one thing so far as i can see
and only one i know your fiancee-er-
well enough to er-realize that if she loves-
the word seemed to worry him-if she er-
cares for you tony and you say she does
money will play only a small part in the er-
affair poor of course you are and al-
ways will be even if you had a million
youd be hard up he grunted huh
leave the battalion indeed not if i know
it
  then you think i ought to marry soon
  at once if you can he hoisted him-
self out of his chair and stretched out his
arms and yawned and now get out im
sick and tired of hearing you talk
  tony grinned and stood up
  its jolly good of you sir to have both-
ered it is really
  get out repeated shannon gruffly
dont worry me
  by his manner he seemed to regard the
interview as of no importance or as merely
a waste of time that might be otherwise
more usefully employed but when tony
had closed the door after him he dropped
into his chair once more and stared blindly
across the little room a dull pain in his
heart and his teeth pressing deeply into his
lower lip
  it seemed impossible had his pride been
so great that he had been unable to see what
was passing before his very eyes had
others seen and he been ignorant of open
warnings the girl he had thought to
marry the one girl in the whole world a
man might worship unashamed had been
taken from him by tony mallagh tony
the irresponsible extravagant happy-go-
lucky reckless hard-up tony had beaten
him
  and sybil in the depths of his despair
there yet remained a feeling of thankful-
ness that he had been spared the shame of
hearing from her own lips what he now
knew
  he rose from his chair and stood gazing
out of the window on to the barrack square
a sense of his own worthlessness gripped
him what right had he to hope that a girl
like sybil would have chosen a man like
himself a man with no knowledge beyond
the army a man who could sit tongue-tied
and half-frightened in her presence the
thought of his own conceit-which he would
have hated in another-sickened him
  but it was all over now and done with
sybil would marry tony mallagh and they
woi id be very happy together and very
poor and he himself captain r b shan-
non d s o second battalion royal
south irish fusiliers would work hard and
hope for war and try and put out of his
mind the picture of the girl whom he had
thought his for the mere asking
chapter ii
love and a rumor of war
not even tony mallagh reckless and
improvident as he was would have
risked marriage had not matters taken an
unexpected turn it was while lie was in
ireland on leave that he read of the death
of sybils aunt he left for aldershot the
same evening
  the girl dressed in deep black was in
the garden at the back of the house when
he arrived
  sybil he said presently after the first
greetings were over what do you intend
to do
  she gave a little shrug
  i dont know tony ive got to earn a
living somehow of course
  oh said tony sagely indeed just
so earn a living he looked at her with
loving admiration
  you sec dear said the girl aunt
tanes income was for life only and-well
t lats all gone so i must do something
nustnt i he said nothing and she con-
tinued im fairly clever at housekeeping i
can look after servants keep accounts gar-
den and so on so i thought t might be use-
ful as a companion to some oiitrr-xr a govern-
ess or-
  tony interrupted with a grunt signifying
extreme disapproval and disgust
  quite so a governess eh ye-es i
can just see you governessing sweetheart
quite so youve no people at all dear
have you
  only a sister in dublin her husbands
in the engineers i could go to her for a
while but-well shes not very well off
and its better for me to do something for
myself isnt it
  no said tony decidedly it isnt-
nothing of the kind ridiculous wouldnt
lieutenant tony mallagh

  hear of it sybil my love let us consider
  the facts why put off any longer what
  might be done now
    she watched him in silence the sunshine
  makirg her hair like spun gold her blue
  eyes blue as the sky above very grave and
  tender and loving her cheeks flushed a lit-
  tle nervous smile on her lips
    sweetheart said tony weve nothing
  to lose by marriage nothing all to gain
  im sick of this everlasting waiting at
  this rate we wont be married for fifty
  years not if were supposed to be waiting
  till i can give you what you deserve con-
  sider the facts old girl and decide whats
  more if the money i have now can keep me
	throwing it about like i do and not trying
  to save itll keep the pair of us thats
  logic wed be poor of course but-will
  you risk it could you marry a poor man
  sybil dear and be happy
    its not myself im worried about she
  said slowly its you ive always been
  poor but it will be hard on you tony to
  have to give up-
    rubbish and fiddlesticks said tony
  he took her into his arms and kissed her
  if thats all sweetheart well be married
  just as soon as we jolly well can ill tackle
  the colonel first thing in the morning you
  leave it to me he wont mind when i tell
  him everything i know hes eating out
  of my hand these days tame as a white
  rabbit with some green-stuff
    and allowing for exaggeration tony was
  quite correct married subalterns were not
  approved of in the south irish for many
  reasc is but for once the colonel raised no
  obje tions
    in your case he said i think its al-
  most the best thing that could have hap-
  pened youve made a most excellent
  choice-most excellent and sny if i
  were you id leave all my financial affairs to
  my wife from what i know theres more
  sense in that young ladys little finger than
  there is in your whole body now run
  along and get married as soon as you
  please
    and married they were within the month
  quite the most valuable of their many
  presents came from shannon who much to
  his regret was called up to london on busi-
  ness on the very morning of the wedding
  this was in the middle of june
    for a little over five weeks tony lived in
  a kind of dream in which fact and fancy
seemed strangely mingled never before
had he known such happiness never in-
deed had he thought such happiness possi-
ble sybil was wonderful each day that
passed revealed in her unexpected charms
  deep down in his heart tony pitied those
less fortunate than himself not only bache-
lors but men with wives less lovely or less
perfect than his wife for after all as he
well knew there was only one sybil how
he had existed without her puzzled him
  but if marriage brought to him happi-
ness so also it brought fear supposing he
were to die what would become of sybil
the thought of the future with all its possi-
bilities of disaster daunted him he must
make provision certainly but how this
was the problem that try as he might he
could not solve
  shannon met him one day walking slow-
ly across the parade-ground toward the
mess
  tony he said wliats wrong
  tony came to himself with a start
whats that hullo sir never saw you
wrong nothing and as if to prove his
words he smiled with the utmost good na-
ture
  shannon shook his head
  known you too long now old son not
to know when youre worrying hows the
wife quite fit eh
  rather said tony
  well somethings troubling you i know
tell it a mile off
  thinking tony laughed thats
all
  shouldnt do it too often then bad
for you he hesitated finances all
right
  yes-so far as it goes sometimes one
doesnt see clearly you know the future
and all that kind of tiling but im not
worrying a sudden thought flashed
through tonys mind you dont notice
that ive changed at all do you since i
married because i havent not in the
very least he wanted that much to be
understood plainly
  changed said shannon no why
the dickens should you be changed
  im glad of that said tony then for
no particular reason he added i think if
anything happened to sybil i should-
well i dont know what i should do
  shannon stared at him without comment
and passed on

adventure
there came an evening soon after
when a certain rumor that owed its
origin to a shot fired in the streets
of a town in far-off bosnia reached the
mess of the royal south irish fusiliers
  all through dinner the tide of talk had
ebbed and flowed in well-worn channels
no trace of care or worry for the future
showed on the faces of those gathered
around the long table under the shaded
lights life offered to man nothing of more
importance than sport in all its branches
hunting fishing racing shooting golf or
the theater perhaps or london or leave in
the autumn when the years training should
be finished as if by instinct all mention
of any topic dealing with the army was
avoided
  but when the last of the mess waiters
stolid privates of the regiment had left the
room there was a sudden silence
  the colonel broad and thickset and
gray as a badger a string of medals adorn-
ing his scarlet mess-jacket a bone-white
scar on his forehead bearing witness to the
skill of a boer marksman at inniskilling
hill leaned back in his chair and glanced
from side to side through half closed eye-
lids
  well he said after a while it looks
like the real thing at last or doesnt
it
  came the senior major nodded dont
see how they can keep out not germany
not russia and wheres it to end eh
  were not ready for war of erse said
one of the other majors we never are
yet maybe the first thing we know well
be fighting
  tony mallagh who was dining in mess
growled
  and just because a maniac at the other
side of europe puts a bullet into some one
weve never heard of all the same itull
be a good job for ireland if it does come
any wars better than civil war shannon
looked at him curiously but and he
went on with a little laugh we wont fight
of course this government of ours isnt
going to let itself be dragged into a war just
on account of a little nation like serbia be-
ing wiped out is it well stay out and
sell goods ammunition and guns and under-
vests and boot-laces and tracts and whisky
to both sides 
  and you shannon said o colonel
what do you say eh
  i dont think sir i know its a war
thats certain the biggest thing that ever
happened
  in the anteroom afterward the mess re-
solved itself into a committee of public
safety for the defense of the realm and
sought knowledge from books of reference
the army list and many maps
  to tony mallagh seated as far as possi-
ble from the chattering groups a volume of
the encyclopedia britannica in his lap
came shannon hands in pockets a grim
smile on his lips
  he dropped into a chair beside him
  im looking up the habits and customs
of the serbs said tony curiosity thats
all
  shouldnt worry about serbia said
shannon try under b
 why b
  belgium
  oh said tony do you mean-you
dont think sir that- he closed the
book you dont mean to tell me the
germans will invade belgium to get at
france
  why not said shannon
  then said tony miserably i dont
see how even this fool of a government can
keep from fighting good lord
  shannon was troubled in his mind how
would he himself supposing he were in
tonys shoes-a married man married less
than two months-bear the news that miglit
send him across the channel to the biggest
war the world had ever seen
  its war at last then said tony in a
low voice
  afraid so said shannon its hard
 you though-awful hard
  tony straightened lwself with a jerk
and thrust two fingers between his collar
and neck as if choking
  yes its hard he said as a matter
of fact sir id been thinking a good deal
lately of the things that might happen
sickness illness accidents and so on mar-
riage makes a man think somehow but
about the only thing i didnt think of was
war i want to see some fighting some time
or other of course who doesnt but-
he uttered a hard laugh-rather rough
luck isnt it coming at this particular
time 
  a voice hailed them
  here shannon youre an expert see if
you can figure tins out and whats the
lieutenant tony mallagh

matter with tony mallagh he looks as if
hed committed a particularly beastly mur-
der or lozl his platoon like he did last
thursday tony dearest what is it ickle
pain in oo tummy tell nursey
  tony laughed and with that the worry
passed off notto return until he was back
in his own home with sybil descending the
stairs
  sybil he said ive something to tell
you something rather important
nothing wrong is there she asked
tony nodded and she led the way into
the drawing-room
  well dear what is it dont be afraid
she said quietly
  she stood by the table very slim and
erect and looking lovelier than ever
  sybil ive bad news for you dear about
the regiment dearest theres going to be
a war in europe and they think well have
to fight
  the south irish
  yes the thought of what she must
suffer rose up to stifle him
  if they send you dear you must go
mustnt you its duty isnt it and
youre worried you poor boy because of
me she kissed him lightly poor old
tony you mustnt why tony you
dont mean to say you think me a coward
her laugh sounded almost happy tony
youre forgetting im the daughter of a sol-
dier as well as being the wife of one im
not frightened love-not in the least
you darling said tony i think
youre the bravest girl alive-and the most
beautiful i was almost afraid of telling
you
  oh said the girl as far as that goes
we were talking it over tonight at dinner
mrs carne and i besides jl  been think-
ing for the last day or so we might have
war if we fight well and good it cant
be helped can it and i wouldnt have you
hold back tony or feel that marriage made
you any less of a soldier for all the money
in the world
  and after that tony mallagh put from
him all thoughts of worry or gloom the
future could take care of itself if the
south irish fusiliers were sent to the war
if there were a war at all he could go light-
heartedly free from anxiety knowing that
sybil wished him to fight and to fight his
hardest and what could a man want more
than that
chapter iii
good-by
ithin the wteek war was declared and
there followed days of wony and end-
less labor for those in authority suppressed
excitement feverish activity much drilling
of reservists musketry field days inocula-
tion inspections with a vague undercur-
rent of emotion apparent throughout the
whole regiment rumors abounded both
in the officers mess and the mens canteen
  imperceptibly but surely the bonds of
discipline tightened the colonel so it was
said was feeling the reins and the regiment
responded the number of defaulters grew
all of a sudden beautifully less even the
most confirmed of offenders became cau-
tious drunkenness decreased as by some
miracle nor was it that the non-commis-
sioned officers turned blind eyes on those
who fell from the path of virtue if this
were war war that would bring to the south
irish much honor and glory and more fight-
ing than even an irish regiment had ever
dreamed of then was it necessary that each
man should take the field ready and fit to
do credit to himself and his battalion also
from the point of view of the rank and file
it behooved the mere private to walk warily
lest when the order came he should be left
alone at home confined to cells doomed to
inaction and misery while others more vir-
tuous fought and perchance died
  the time for good-bys drew near shan-
non busy with the affairs of his company
had seen little of tony mallagh for some
days save in the presence of others or on
duty
  then one afternoon tony overtook him
and said that sybil was leaving for london
the next morning and would he come up to
the house if he could spare half-an-hour or
so to say good-by
  yes said shannon yes certainly
very glad
  she said shed like to see you con-
tinued tony and ive been so rushed
lately i never thought anything more about
it until today you see we decided it would
be better for her not to be here when the
regiment leaves she didnt want it no
more did i too depressing and shes
going to stay with mrs carne in london
so that evening shannon sat in the small
bare drawing-room by the tall window that

adventure
opened on to the lawn while the girl wrap-
ped in a big white cloak-for the night air
was cool-talked lightly as one without
care
  it was not until tony whistling cheerful-
ly growling about his kit went off and left
them together that she told why it was she
had sent for him
  its very good of you to come captain
shannon she said quietly i wanted to
ask you a favor
  anything i can do mrs mallagh i
will
  im leaving tomorrow she said and
this is the last time ill see you-
  till er-we come back put in shannon
till we er-come back eh
  when will that be theres always the
when captain shannon isnt there for
a while she was silent
  from the road there came the sound of
some one whistling in the distance a train
rumbled through the night bound perhaps
to tide-water with troops the breeze whis-
pered in the leaves of the trees bearing
with it the scent of roses the clear notes
of a bugle sounded faintly from the direc-
tion of the north camp
  captain shannon said the girl sudden-
ly the regiment you and the rest are go-
ing to fight thats as it should be no
woman worth her salt would wish for any-
thing else
  its hard on the married men said
shannon gruffly - hard i beg your
pardon airs mallagh-inexcusable
  its not easy for us women she con-
tinued in a low voice but that doesnt
alter facts does it and if we are to fight
why-we must fight our best its the wait-
ing that tries one i know wailing until
theres a telegram or a letter or even a line
in the paper and we learn that what we
feared has happened and-and life isnt
worth living any more- for an instant a
shade of worry showed in the blue eyes i
remember when  was only a small girl my
eldest brother twenty-one he was was kill-
ed at spion kop-you were there with the
regiment werent you and we saw his
name in the paper before the wire arrived
from the war office breakfast-time it was
and mother-
  she stopped and her fingers plucked idly
at the white fur on her cloak
  but it doesnt do any good to think of
what might happen thats why  in al-
ways so cheerful tony too thinking
makes you imagine things and then they
happen
  you mustnt talk like that mrs mal-
lagh said shannon its not right why
-good lord dont you understand that
-that-
  he in his turn broke off helpless to say
what should be said
  she shook her head
  dont think for one moment that id
keep him at home even if i had the power
or that-that i think hes going to die i
dont but captain shannon- she lean-
ed forward in her chair and her eyes sought
his as if seeking some ray of hope or com-
fort-listen i know hell come back to
me i feel it but i cant help being a little
anxious i cant really though i try not
to
  well said shannon doubtfully
  what i wanted to ask you was would
you just keep an eye on tony when he gets
out to the front and pull him up if you
think hes deliberately trying to get him-
self killed she gave a little laugh
  shannon stared at her in dumb ix-wilder-
ment did she think he could help did
she think that it was within his power or
the power of any mortal to save her husband
from harm had she no idea what war was
or meant the very calmness of her words
and her steady smile was an added mystery
  of course i know that hes got to run
into danger i want him to hes got to
prove himself as good as the best i want
to be proud of him but you know what
tony is hes foolish in some ways hes
never seen any fighting yet and hes bound
to be reckless over it just to show that hes
brave so i thought that if you could give
him a word of advice it might help him
she raised her eyebrows you dont think
im panicky do you captain shannon
im not im not even worrying but-
hes all ive got in the world and-well if
he went life wouldnt be worth the trouble
of living
  a deep pity swept over shannon but he
did not speak
  youre not angry with me captain
shannon she asked
  angry of course not
  i asked you because youve been a friend
to him and- she hesitated her cheeks
flaming-and a friend to me also
  a friend the word seemed to mock him
                         
a friend and somehow the old heartache
and longing that he had imagined put aside
forever came back he himself had suf-
fered far more than he had thought possi-
ble so now he could feel the agony that
gripped the girl seated by the open window
-the girl he had once hoped to make his
wife if tony died she would lose every-
thing life had to offer she said as much
herself
   ill do my best he said quietly
thank you she said i knew you
would
  there were footsteps in the hall and
tony entered
   hope you didnt think i was neglecting
you sir ive been working over the ever-
lasting problem of packing my kit how
on earth do they expect us to manage with
only thirty-seven pounds of baggage eh
shannon dragged his wandering thoughts
out of the future to the present
  you either leave half what you want
behind or else you start off to the war with
about a hundredweight of stuff strapped on
to you beside what youve got to carry al-
ready
  lord im no blighted dromedary
and think of the looks of the thing i want
to look like a soldier not like a traveling
tinker bad for the illustrated papers too
special attraction double-page photograph
from the front charge of the south irish
spoiled by honorable self in foreground car-
rying a portable bath-tub and a pair of
waders and a gramaphone on my back
and encouraging my brave lads to go on
without me waving a fishing-rod in one
hand and the parrots cage in the other
not a nice thought is it and i couldnt
really charge carrying everything i ought
to take with me could i
  youll excuse him captain shannon
im sure hes not often taken like that
we try and keep it quiet sad isnt it
shannon laughed and stood up
    must go now im afraid
   sybil was also standing smiling as if they
had been discussing the most unimportant
topics imaginable
  good-by then and thank you very
much indeed youll write sometimes
wont you you wont forget will you
rather not only too delighted
she held out a small hand good-by
then and well meet after the war is over
tell you what said tony with sudden
ii
enthusiasm well all have dinner to-
gether in london as soon as we get back
at the savoy or the carlton sybil you
wont forget will you or-or if were all
broke by that time the cabmans shelter at
hyde park comer
  right said shannon gravely mind
thats settled and well go to the theater
afterward
  as he closed the gate of the front garden
and turned away he saw tony and the girl
standing in the doorway side by side sil-
houetted against the light he wondered
as he waved his hand what bitterness and
sorrow good-by might mean for them less
than two months of marriage and then the
parting
  and for once shannon could feel glad
that he at least left no one to mourn his
going
       two days later very early in the
morning the second battalion of
the royal south irish fusiliers
swung out of barracks and down the white
road that led to the station and the battle-
fields of belgium and the tune to which
they marched played by the drums and fifes
wras garry owten a tune to which their
forbears had set out nearly a hundred years
before on a like errand of mercy
  as they passed through the village men
and women came to the door of the houses
windows were thrown open and heads thmt
forth and as if sprung into existence from
nowhere a swarm of small boys kept pace
with the band the men marching at ease
laughed and joked their good-bys
  shannon picking up the old familiar land-
marks with his eyes listening to the shrill
whimper of the fifes saw standing by the
front of a small shop apart from the people
a girl wrapped in a long coat
  something about her seemed vaguely fa-
miliar tony mallagh marching with the
platoon immediately ahead had halted and
was waiting for him to come abreast
  he quickened his pace
  tony he said theres sybil
  what tony uttered a little exclama-
tion of despair then making his way
through the crowd reached the girl in the
long coat
  sybil he whispered you shouldnt
have why did you
  she held out her hands and smiled
  i had to
lieutenant tony mallagh
w
adventure
  whether people were watching or not
made no difference now he drew her to
him and kissed her
  i just had to she said but i never
intended that you should see me tony
never
   my dear my dear
  her lips quivered and it seemed as if her
strength were failing yet she still smiled at
him
  youd better go tony i mustnt keep
you
  its hard love-i never knew how hard
till now
  hush dont make it worse dear ill
be all right while youre away remember
that wont you
  the war wont last very long love i
know it cant
  and why should it they were only go-
ing to fight germany and what was ger-
many the greatest military power on
earth-nothing more and were they to
be frightened because of that wtiat were
mere numbers did he not belong to the
royal south irish fusiliers the finest regi-
ment in the whole world bar none was
not that sufficient in itself so
  it will be all over by the new year said
tony you see if it isnt
  she flashed a little smile at him through
her tears for she was crying now and tried
to laugh
  of course sooner i hope
  good-by sweetheart good-by
  she kissed him on the lips twice then
gave him a litde shove
  go dear please
  he turned and hurried after the regiment
a tightness in his throat and a mist beforc-
his eyes
chapter iv
the opdeal of fife
	ro those ignorant of war and they
a be many a regiments history and
traditions may seem of small importance
but a regiment that bears on its colors the
names of famous victories and can trace
its ancestry back tp the days of wellington
or marlborough or clive or wolfe has a
faith in its own prowess that counts for
much when there is an enemy to be faced
ami beaten
  the very thought of failure was to the
men of the south irish nut merely remote
but impossible would they men who had
joined the army of their own free will men
who had served in the four quarters of the
globe go down before those who were con-
scripts forced to serve not though they
were outnumbered ten to one
  what german regiment was tit to breathe
the same air as the south irish the rank
and file had faith not only in themselves
but in their officers if there were fighting
to be done the royal south irish fusiliers
would show the way to any battalion of any
regiment scots irish welch or english in
the army the guards themselves could do
no more even the recruits fresh from
their training at the depot in the south of
ireland non-commissioned officers or newly
joined reservists not yet free of the taint
of civil life who talked of war as men who
knew its meaning could feel that they were
fighters no less than those others old soldiers
of twenty years of service
  so tony mallagh watching his men hear-
ing their talk and laughter and songs could
rejoice and feel certain in his heart that
wheresoever it might be his duty to lead
there they would follow for were they not
of the same blood as the men of inkerman
and delhi and barossa and waterloo the
campaign might go against them-generals
and staff officers might blunder plans might
miscarry the artillery be outranged-but
whatever happened though the machine it-
self might break down through overwork
the blame could never rest with the men
-or not with the men of the south irish
not even the thought of sybil waiting at
home for news entirely took from him the
pride he had in his regiment
  whatever the future might have in store
the present with its steady tramping of
many feet the passing of horse and guns in
clouds of thick dust the little towns in the
hot sunlight the bivouac under the stars
the meeting at cross-roads of other regi-
ments the bustle and movement and change
of scene was all that mattered
  and then one afternoon there was borne
on the breeze a faint far-off rumbling
  whats that said a voung private
thundher
  ihundher telford the company ser-
geant-major grimly humorous chuckled
thats no thundher tis a lulbby that
ye re hearin did ve niver leshen to guns
before
  guns
lieutenant tony mallagh

  sure an its guns tis fiel arthillery
in acthion an theyre fightin yonda al-
ready	
  shannon who had overheard the conver-
sation laughed
 remember the morning we heard the
guns at colenso sergeant-major
  colenso i shall i iver forgit sorr an
what happened afther
next morning the south irish fu-
silicrs were under lire by noon
they were blooded two men being
killed by shrapnel
  the success or failure of a regiment in
battle depends on its officers no less than
on the rank and file this is beyond argu-
ment and although skill in the art of war
-a knowledge of tactics strategy topogra-
phy military history and higher mathemat-
ics-are no doubt highly useful the private
soldier and more especially the irish pri-
vate demands in his officer not only skill
but also courage-the courage that stops
short of nothing not even death
  in shannon the men of the south irish
found one after their own hearts-their ideal
tighter in the agony and despair of the
long retreat from mons to the marne when
day after day they were driven along with-
out mercy footsore and sleepy and famish-
ed turning at times and fighting fierce rear-
guard actions to save both themselves and
others shannon never for a moment lost
their confidence even when things were at
their worst-when the german guns raked
the trenches when men were dying like flies
in autumn when the mere horror and help-
lessness of modern war sapped the courage
and weakened the resolution of the strong-
est-shannon was at his best
  and when the limit had been reached be-
yond which human endurance can not go-
when even the finest soldiers on earth out-
numbered must break-his voice and pres-
ence scornfully tolerant of their weakness
brought back to the men around him their
self-respect he asked no man to go where
he himself would not venture his life he
seemed to regard as of no importance he
was without fear even casualties that re-
duced the regiment to less than two-thirds
its strength left him unmoved this was
the attitude he purposely adopted noth-
ing could be gained so he argued rightly in
letting his men see that he too felt the shock
and horror of death in its most awful form
  tony mallagh watched him with despair
for in spite of the tales that he had heard
of past campaigns tony had never in his
heart believed it possible that any man
could bear himself in action as did shannon
yet what shannon could do he tony mal-
lagh must do also no matter how fierce
the fire an officer of the royal south irish
fusiliers the finest regiment in the army
must show himself proof against the slight-
est sign of fear he must remember always
that his men trusted in him to lead them
and that whatever happened no matter
what others in other regiments might say
or do no sign of panic or hesitation in the
face of danger should escape him this was
the law of the regiment that must not be
broken
  there are some secrets a man will try and
hide even from himself when first he had
heard the distant thudding of the field-guns
tony had felt a thrill of fierce excitement
yet as the time drew near when he should
find himself in action a dull lassitude crept
over him his limbs seemed to lose their
power his throat was dry and parched
this he knew was nothing merely over-
excitement nervousness he had had
the feeling before often before entering the
ring to box it was nothing
  and yet when the regiment came at
length into the zone of fire when the shells
began to burst on every side and the bul-
lets whispered overhead and men dropped
then did tony mallagh lieutenant in the
royal south irish fusiliers find himself in
the grip of a fear more terrible than any-
thing he could have dreamed nor did the
fear pass as he had fondly hoped rather
did it grow and grow fed on the sights and
sounds of battle
  but though his whole being craved for
safety though had he obeyed his instincts
he would have turned and fled he forced
himself to a semblance of indifference to
danger he laughed and jested with his
men he talked easily he steadied his voice
and controlled his movements through sheer
force of will he was afraid of being killed
afraid of being wounded and yet still more
afraid of being called a coward this was
the greater fear had he been less a cow-
ard so he reasoned bitterly he would have
shamed himself forever
  war was terrible war was the waiting
hour upon hour while the enemys guns
searched for the hidden trench war was
m
adventure
the listening to the sobs of the dying and
of the wounded who coujd no i die war
was the witnessing of sights more terrible
than hell itsell could offer war was the
remembering in dead of night those left at
home to wait and mourn vet only a few
short weeks before-and this was to tony
the most bitter thought of all-war had
seemed no more than the long awaited
chance to prove his manhood the first
days fighting in the trendies had told him
everything he wished to know he tony
mallagh who had looked on courage as
mans highest virtue was a coward
early one morning before it was
lightra large force of the enemy at-
tacked a post held by b company
of the south irish a shallow trench thrown
up the night before on the edge of a small
wood
  when the sky was no more than a pale
gray in the east scattered shots were heard
from in front soon after the men of the
outlying picket arrived at a double drag-
ging with them one who was wounded the
germans were close at hand
  tony who had been talking with shan-
non caught his breath so the germans
were coming were they how many the
corporal in charge of the picket did not
know swarrms of thim he said tony
found himself shaking as if cold
  but cold or not-and he had not felt that
he was cold-he must stand his ground or
else people might say he was frightened 
and that would never do
  shannon was speaking
  theyll be coming along in a minute or
so now and weve got to give em a bit of
a dusting
  shannons voice was filled with a curious
exultation tony turned to him heavy and
listless he was going to fight he was
going to be shot at and perhaps he was
going to die
  nevertheless true to his training he
forced a laugh
  rather he said were in for a jolly
scrip i hope like their infernal impu-
dence trying to rush us isnt it
  he moved off to that portion of the trench
held by his platoon
  his platoon sergeant stretched out his
arm and pointed
  luk sott do ye sec thim
  and in the dimness tony made out ad-
vancing toward the trench a gray mass
huge and indistinct and vague
  he gulped unsteadily were the ger-
mans so near as that then ought he not
to be doing something did shannon
know
  and then as in a dream he heard in suc-
cession his own voice giving the word of
command number five platoon-at the
enemy in front-rapid fire the answering
volleys from the rifles of his men and a wild
cheering unlike the deep cheers of british
troops from the foe like the oncoming of
a wall the germans advanced tony fight-
ing back the fears that had gripped him
shivered
  let them have it south irish he said
let them have it
  his men were strangely restive their
firing was ragged three or four were not
even firing at all
  whats the matter there said tony
you reilly youre not wounded are
you
  at another time these same men would
have resisted to the death but now either
one nights waiting or the mystery and
chill of the dawn or the suddenness of the
attack had sapped their resolution for
without waiting without warning as if the
movement were prearranged or ordered
they clambered out of their trench and ran
  tony knowing that if they left him his
only hope of hiding his fears was gone
made a half-hearted despairing effort to
stop their flight
  -you he cried and his voice was
lost in the crash of musketry from the right
and in front -you you fools get
back what the blazes do vou think youre
doing
 go on bhoys shouted a man
theyre on top of us the divils
  tony staggered against a tree overborne
by the rush the bullets from the germans
who advanced firing from the hip were
swishing through the branches a man
stumbled and dropped his ritle then went
on slowly limping another shrieked in
mortal agony and fell
  and that settled it so far as tony mal-
lagh was concerned he turned and ran
without a thought save for his own safety
was he to be left to face the germans sin-
gle-handed was he to be killed for the
sake ol a mere outworn tradition was
not his life as valuable to himself as the life
v
lieutenant tony mallagh

of any private and was it not much more
valuable to the regiment
  he had made his way at a quick shuf-
fling run almost to the other side of the
small wood when his foot caught in a pro-
jecting root he tripped and fell his
head crashed against a tree-trunk and he
knew no more until faintly as if at a great
distance he seemed to hear a voice calling
his name
  tony old chap come on what is it
  shannons voice surely
  tony opened his eyes to find himself in
the wood huddled against a tree with the
sun just risen showing like a red orb
through the mist and shannon on his knees
beside him his head throbbed he felt
dazed and stupid he put his hand to his
forehead and brought it away covered with
blood two or three privates stood looking
at him one was wounded
 hullo why-why-
  feeling better said shannon we
havent much time to spare you know
  he noticed then that shannon was star-
ing at him in a curious way almost as if he
were angry or disappointed or puzzled he
tried to think shannon helped him to his
feet
  weve got to be moving and pretty
quick he said theyll be coming on
again in a minute or two
  taking him by the arm he hurried him
off
  wholl be coming on asked tony
  and then a dull feeling of horror crept
over him he had turned his back on the
enemy the others had beaten them off
he had run did shannon know had he
seen him make off surely not it had
been too dark and then 
  not going too fast am i said shan-
non suddenly
  no said tony my head aches but
im better much better and what-
what happened
  you ought to know tony what were
you doing eh there was a note of doubt
in shannons voice
  my fellows bolted god only knows
why
  some of them did not all but what
about you man what were you doing
where were you going
  me i went after them-to rally them
lo	try and get them back and as i was
doing my best to turn them i caught ray
foot and fell thats all i remember he
ended abruptly
  oh said shannon i understand i
wondered
  looked queer perhaps said tony with
a nervous laugh
  oh nonsense might have happened to
any one
  and tony felt that a burden had been
lifted from off his mind shannon under-
stood shannon knew now that he had been
rallying his men his secret was safe but
there remained in his consciousness the
dread that when next the hour of trial came
when he should be tested once more he
should fail again for whatever might be
believed of him the truth remained he
an officer in the royal south irish fusiliers
had run in action
  they joined the rest of the battalion
hullo tony whats wtong not
wounded are you one of the other sub-
alterns spoke to him
  not exactly said tony fell and cut
my head open
  hard luck some of your people ar-
rived back here some time ago- looking like
lost sheep
  i know i tried to stop them
shouldnt worn old thing theyll not
do it again
  hope not anyway said tony
shannon was troubled even in the fight-
ing that followed for the germans attacked
once more and in the retirement early in
the afternoon at the back of his mind ob-
truding itself when least expected was a
strange wonderment
  tony had run of course that was ob-
vious but why and to hide the truth
be had lied had he tried to rally his men
he would not have followed them so far
what fear was it that had driven him to do
what no man should do and call himself a
man had he been seized with sudden
panic or could it be that tony mallagh
as good a man as ever walked-tony the
boxer the best rider in uie battalion tonv
the man who had fought the greengrocer at
portsmouth was a coward to shannon it
seemed impossible and yet it was true
ton had turned his back on the enemy
and run why
  and then there was sybil sybil waiting
at home for newrs and shannon remem-
bering that last evening in the little draw-
ing-room and how proudly she had talked

adventure
of tonv felt a sudden wild anger tony
her husband had proved himself unworthy
  after this shannon noticed many things
about tony mallagh that were puzzliug
he studied him tinder lire on the march
and in billets by the time that the re-
treat had ended lie had changed greatly
he looked years older tired dispirited he
was cool enough in action that was evident
almost too cool at a glance it seemed as
if he held himself in check he was cheer-
ful after a fashion he still talked in the
same amusing self-assertive manner he
bore without murmuring or showing him-
self impatient every hardship and discom-
fort he showed no sign of weariness nor
doubt of victory he was firm with his men
yet always kind and considerate
  nevertheless there remained to shannon
the memory of the morning when tony had
chosen dishonor rather than face death
men did run in action of course some-
times even the best were liable to panic
but that tony mallagh should have proved
himself a coward was to shannon almost
as if he himself had been detected in some
wrong
  true to his promise he wrote to sybil at
the first opportunity a few- lines scribbled
in pencil-
   tony is splendid you have no idea he is happy
and contented always i have heard no word of
complaint from him at any time and he is as
brave in battle as any man could be the men wor-
ship him honestly you would think to see him
that he had been fighting all his life he took to it
naturally like a duck takes to water i he best sub-
altern in the battalion thats what they call him
we are all very proud of him he fights as if he
were playing football or boxing jf you should im-
agine from anything he writes to you that he has
reason to be disappointed or worried perhaps do
not pay any attention it is not true wc all of us
think he has done splendidly from the colonel
downward
  and the part about the colonel was as
he discovered soon after writing quite true
for the colonel thought well of tony
  im not saying a word against the rest
of em he said but tony mallaghs the
best-far and away the best  m very sat-
isfied indeed
  yes sir shannon nodded weve as
good a crowd of subalterns in the south
irish as youd want
  and hes not foolish like young ocon-
nell for instance oconnell er-seems all
the time bent on-well on showing off
tony mallaghs sound looks after his
men keeps em in hand wont let em kill
themselves off just for effect and you
know yourself shannon what that means
with a crowd like weve got no im very
pleased with young mallagh very pleased
indeed hes steadied down immensely of
late-since hes been married in fact good
wife hes got too very good yes im
pleased with him hell go far
  and as shannon discovered the men
were of a like opinion
the regiment had halted for a brief
rest one night and the men were
bivouacked in a large field the ri-
fles were stacked the smoke of the fires
drifted upward the sky was a dull orange
in the west men were scattered about on
the grass smoking or sleeping worn out by
the days toil waiting for their evening meal
  shannon coming in from the pickets stop-
ped to speak to the company sergeant-ma-
jor he had said all he had wanted to and
was about to move off when the voices of
a group of men seated only a few yards dis-
tant drew his attention
  did ye see him today whin owld mc-
ginnis was like to dhrop with fatigue an
his feet worn to ribbons by the dint of the
marchin were afther havin a good lad
is misther mallagh an no mistake
  hes unbelaivably sthrick
  an with raison for what wud the
regmint be like if he warnt with malin-
gerers an skrimshankers in it like you tim

began to speak

dhier can have hes a good little man im
not denyin the same but he ought to be

shannon was startled

lected wait till he gits angry
chapter v
the woman at the farm
late in the afternoon tony mallagh
and some dozen or so men strung out
in open order made their way down a steep
wooded hill-slope toward a small farm
tucked away in the narrow valley the day
was very hot and still the sky a deep blue
flecked with white clouds guns thundered
incessantly in the distance
  at the edge of the wood where the trees
grew thin tony halted and let his eyes
wander from right to left suspicious of
danger across a field of bleached stubble
lay the farmhouse small and white with a
red-tiled roof overgrown with moss and
ivy and showing no sign of life save the
thin trickle of smoke from the chimney
beyond was a large barn and outbuildings
a well and an apple-orchard further off
again were more trees and the ridge that
made up the opposite slope of the valley
purty as a pictliure said one of the
men sure it puts me in mind of kerry
dont see any one around do you
sergeant-major said tony but wed
better be careful
  therell be no germans lift this way
sorr if thats what ye mane
  theres a cow yonda sorr by the
threes
  i think said tony deliberately that
well investigate corporal birkett you
and kelly you just work round to the left
will you oconnor and madden bear
away to the right he paused and i
think the rest of us can risk walking right
up to the front door
  mebbe therell be such a thing as a
dhrink o milk to be had for the axin
said a private cheerfully or beer
  as they drew near the house a woman
came to the door and stood looking toward
them with a hand shielding her eyes from
the glare of the sun

    i wondher now can she sphake english
 said the sergeant-major doubtfully
   niver yit do i remimber meetin anny
 wan what cudnt save an ixciptin that
 gerrman orfcer what we caught in the
 dhrain two mornins back-him that swore
 so fluent in his own tongue whin tim dolan
 dhropped his rifle on top of him
   tony opened the little wooden gate and
 walked up the path between masses of flow-
 ers when he was within a few paces of the
 woman he halted and saluted she looked
 at him with a grave face and then as if re-
 assured gave a little nervous bow a small
 girl ran out and clung shyly to her skirts
 from the back of the house there arose the
 frantic barking of a dog and the voice of
 private oconnor uttering soothing sounds
    racking his memory for the right words
 tony began to speak in french slowly and
 badly the woman laughed
   nimporu she said jc park an-
 glais-a little is it not so and monsieur
 is english
    tony nodded surprised
   from behind his back came a low whis-
 per
    shes makin a big mistake its irish
 we are south irish corrk tipperary
 the place its a long way to
   have you had any germans here
 asked tony
   she shook her head they had seen no
 soldiers at all not one no germans had
 come into the valley not yet at least nor
 would they not now she made a little
 gesture of contempt with her hands they
 were going like frost before the sun she
 had no fear of germans why should she
 have she was only a woman doing the
 work that the good god had pven her
 who would harm her not even the ger-
 mans
   but said ton are you here all by
 yourself arent there any men-belonging
 to the place havent you a husband
to tony it seemed impossible that a
 woman should be living with her children
alone in the midst of a battle surely she
must have some man who could help if
help were needed
   her husband the woman laughed
 proudly where would he be at such a
 time he was fighting-pour ij painc
 she hoped she said that he was killing
 germans he had left her when war broke
 out she might not see him again till the
is
adventure
boches were driven back across the rhine
if he shuuld die- she gave a shrug of her
shoulders monsieur soyez certain qiie
quil mourra bicn
  there was no man nearer the farm she
added than those in the little town across
the hill only her father but would the
officer care to step inside and see for him-
self he saw strangers seldom her father
it would cheer him up also there was milk
to be had and some cider and perhaps an
egg or so
  tony glanced at the little group of dirty
unshaven irishmen in their war-worn khaki
  telford he said to the sergeant-
major come along in and see what her
fathers like queer eh
  they entered the house in the little
kitchen which was very clean and neat with
a stone floor and low ceiling and a row of red
geraniums in llower-pots on the long
window-sill there sat a withered little old
man with bowed shoulders and wrinkled
face and bright eyes he smiled at tony
but made no attempt to rise from the big
chair in which he was seated in front of the
stove
  bon jour visicu said tony
  the little old man who was dressed in
black and about whose legs was a shawl of
some reddish plaid stuff nodded and smiled
and said a few words in a high thin voice
so quickly that tony could not grasp their
meaning he turned to the woman
  he helps you in the work eh
  she shook her head as if such a thing
were unheard of
  once not now see monsieur and
then tonv seeing the crutches leaning
against the wall understood
  toor old chap im sorry
  the womans face clouded suddenly it
was sad he was helpless able to walk
only with such pain and labor helpless
since five years now he had done nothing
he was not old but he had aged greatly
his grief when war came-ah but it was
terrible in  he had been too young to
fight now he was unable she spoke to the
little mar and he smiled at her and nodded
his head
  arent yu afraid to stay here so near
the lighting asked tony
  and if  left monsieur who would look
after the farm the men go to the war for
their countrys safety and honor may not
a woman work where would the harvest
have been but for me and i am strong
monsieur as strung almost as my man him-
self who is a soldier she laughed and
if i left munsieur where would i go
also- she nodded toward the opposite
corner of the room where in a cradle between
the window and a tall oak dresser lay a buby
soundly sleeping-one has responsibilities
is it not and where should i go to
paris no monsieur if my man returns
and tinds me gone what would he think
does a soldier desert his regiment or his
flag no more does a woman desert her
home i have my duty even as mv hus-
band if i stay here no one will do me harm
a woman with two little ones is safe
  tony watched her while she spoke hard
work and she must have worked hard since
her husband left had not stolen away her
looks she was well built not tall but
straight and strong and slender her skin
was a warm dusky bronze with a rich red
in her cheeks her hair was a golden lr  n
her eyes were blue once she must have
been pretty he was certain she war that
now indeed if she were nicely dressed
  the woman was filling a jug from a cask
that stood by the dresser still chattering
away in her queer clipped english as if
glad to have the chance to air her knowl-
edge
  the cider was good she said of her own
making her husband had said that her
cider was better than any and he was a
judge she straightened her back and
laughed happily
  and then like the flashing of a search-
light in the darkness it came over tony that
there was something about her an indefina-
ble something that put him in mind of
sybil his lips twisted into a little smile of
amusement at the fancy like sybil but
of course that was ridiculous was he to
compare a french farmers wife with sybil
as well might he compare telford strong
and active and healthy with the little crip-
ple in the arm-chair
  but was the fancy as he had termed it
so foolish she did not resemble sybil in
the very least and yet there was a likeness
her eyes were the same blue her hair was
the same golden-brown even her laugh
had the same joyous freshness as had
sybils and when asked a question of
which she was not quite sure she had the
same trick of raising her eyebrows before
answering
lieutenant tony mallagh

  moreover there was the certainty that
as this girl had spoken of her husband
lighting for his country so also would sybil
speak of him
  the french woman approached a glass
of cider in each hand
  but perhaps monsieur would prefer
some wine
  tony shook his head the cider would do
splendidly
  and youre not afraid to be here by
yourself he asked its very brave of
you but i think somehow its running a
great risk youre so very near the fight-
ing and we dont know which way it may
go
  she shrugged her shoulders the good
god would preserve her she knew it
no harm would come if she stayed at home
and did the work of the farm
  tony set down his empty glass
  very good indeed he said tres
bon
  the woman held out the jug would
monsieur care for some more then he
shook hs head and smiled no he had had
sufficieni they ought to be moving on
if she had a glass or so to spare for the men
though he would be grateful she nodded
and led the way out of the little kitchen into
the sunshine where the soldiers were waiting
  while they drank she watched them with
an air of pride and good-nature and when
tony offered to pay refused firmly no
they were fighting for france for her for
her children money no it was a pleas-
ure
  tony beckoned to the little girl and when
she came to him smiling shyly put a gold
coin into her tiny palm
  merci msieu she said and running
to her mother hid her rosy cheeks in her
skirts
  where did you learn english asked
tony suddenly you speak very well in-
deed have you been in england
  she laughed and shook her head in
england no never what little english
she knew she had learned from an english
lady and gentleman for whom she had
cooked in paris a fine couple generous to
a degree but so simple they had stayed
a winter and spring in paris to learn
french they had learned no more than a
few words that went without saying but
-again she shrugged her shoulders-but
she herself she had had to learn english
and she laughed once more as if it had been
the greatest joke in the world and as if
the men before her were her own friends
and countrymen and not soldiers of another
nation on active service warning her that
the fighting was near and might come
nearer
  well said tony we must go now
maybe well see you again au revoir
madame and good luck
  they went away past the bam and sheds
and the orchard at the back of the house to
the wooded slope on the opposite side of
the valley
  when they reached the foot of the hill
tony turned and looked back the little
farm with its meadows and orchard was like
some quiet haven far from the worlds
trouble and turmoil for the first time since
the morning when he had left home there
had stolen into tony mallaghs conscious-
ness a sense of restfulness and peace there
was no war men no longer killed and
wounded each other to show their love for
their countries the booming of the big
guns that never ended became as the mur-
muring of waves on the shore in the valley
one might live and be happy even he
tony mallagh of the south irish
  and as he gazed he saw the woman
standing at the back of the house he
waved his hand in farewell and with a little
sigh followed his men
  funny isnt it he said to the company
sergeant-major that a woman should
stop here all alone with fighting so near
plucky of her of course
  it is so said telford but im
think in shes as safe where she is as shed
be if she moved weve no manes of know-
in how matthers are goin yit but from
what we have seen this past few days an
the way were afther pushin ahead it luks
like the germans can do nothin but go
back where they come from
  for a time tony said nothing when he
spoke again they were nearing the crest of
the ridge
  its rough on her having to be by her-
self isnt it and she so everlastingly
cheerful thats what beats me you
wouldnt think her husband was away
fighting would you he may be dead by
this time for all she knows too
  and once more he thought of sybil at
home wondering if he were still alive hop-
ing and trusting yet never knowing what

adventure
minute might bring the news that would
take from her life all hope of happiness
  its harrd on the women is war said
telford you an me sorr were men an
what do we know what fears that poor sowl
down in the valley yonda is sufferin an
whats more well niver see her again to
find out whats become of her
  in this the sergeant-major was wrong
that night tony found a letter
from sybil awaiting him the first
he had had at the front
dearest
  i am wondering where you will be when you get
this or if indeed you will get it at all i have heard
from you four times already and when your hist
letter was written you had not liad so much as a
line from me but dear  have written more than
a dozen times you dont think tony dear that i
havent do you i hate to think of your wondering
why i dont write for i did tony really and truly
and i sent oil parcels of socks and shirts for the
nights will be cold out of doors and there were also
some cigarettes and cake and chocolate i do hope
dearest that something has reached you by now
  i have no news and the little i have had i told
you in my other letters if you have had them you
will know but its nothing more than each day the
same as the day before i am very happy with mrs
came she is a perfect dear we do a good deal of
sewing and knitting socks and things for the troops
and we read the papers all of them and are so
proud to hear that the south irish have done so
well we heard there was a wounded soldier at the
london hospital who belonged to the south irish
so we went to see him he was a man called
osullivan in mr packmans platoon and so inter-
esting he had seen you in the retreat after mons
and he said that you were so brave and cheerful
and kind oh my dear my dearl i nearly cried
when he told us you are having such hardships
out at the front and here am i at home safe and
living in comfort while you are lighting it seems
unfair
  tony i never realized how much you were-are
to me while i had you at home now i know
youre everything my dear everything and
sometimes i wake up at night with a start and
imagine i can hear the guns in the distance and i
wonder whether you arc lying out in the open and
if it is raining and cold and where you are my
dear you are never out of my thoughts i pray
for you night and morning and sweetheart-dont
laugh dear-whenever ive nothing particular to
do whenever i find myself with a minute or two lo
spare-and thats very often alas-i say little
prayers to god that he will bring you backto me
i know he will i feel certain and i know love
that you will fight bravely and make your men feel
i was so glad to know that they liked and admired
you so much sullivan poor chap has lost both
his arms isnt it awful i do not know what he
will do when he gets birttcr we are hoping that the
government pension will be really enough for him
and his wife lo live on
  and now dear i must end i do pray that this
cruel war may soon be over and that the south
irish will help lo win the victory that is coming
and l he day cant come too on tony mine when
i shall see you again but i am so proud of you
tony dear and i just hate and despise any man
that at the present lime will not see that he is
wanted and that it is his duty to train and prepare
himself to fight for his country
  with love old boy and heaps of good luck
from svbil
  p s-poor mrs keane i was so sorry for her
when she had news that her husband was taken
risoner she was so sad about it but i comforted
er by saying that there was one thing good in the
news and that was that he was safe at least if be
was a prisoner of war he would at least be out of the
fighting and that cheered her up quite a lot we
hear that his wound is not as bad as it might have
been major came wrote and told her but she
felt that it was such a blow on poor captain keane
to be out of everything from now on
  tony read and reread the letter he
could almost see sybil as she wtote it and he
felt that though far away in the flesh in the
spirit she was very near had he ever real-
ized properly in the past in those few short
dream-weeks when they had been man and
wife the depth of feeling in a womans
heart the letter told him far more fully
than the mere words could express what
sybil thought of him how much her happi-
ness depended on his safe return suppo-
sing he were killed it almost hurt him like
some physical pain to think what life w ould
be for her the loneliness the dreariness
if it wfas bad now what would it be ii he
were dead
  he folded the letter and placed it in his
pocketbook what was the use of fretting
worry- would only make things the harder
to bear because his country was at war he
must risk his life a feeling of sick help-
lessness came over him he might be
killed at any moment of the day or
night
  nothing could save him nothing except
to turn and run and would that help
sybil was proud of him proud oh god
proud of a man who was a coward at heart
who had deserted his post in battle who
had to fight his own fears at ever turn
and at that the helplessness gave way to
a fierce anger--war why should a
man a free man consent to do what his
whole being loathed why because he
had to because there was no escape he
laughed
  hullo young feller why the mirth
  shannon big and broad and smiling had
entered the little room tony felt a sudden
lieutenant tony mallagh

envy what cares had shannon shan-
non had no one at home depending on him
shannon went into action free from anxiety
what did shannon know of the sorrow and
grief of parting
  just heard from sybil he said
  ah shannons square sunburnt face
became very serious ah and how is she
fit i hope
  i think so said tony seems to be
shes a little worried of course
  of course said shannon and he nod-
ded his head once or twice as if he could
understand and sympathize which thought
tony bitterly was the one thing a man like
shannon could not do
  he understand he sympathize why
shannon had no more feeling about him
than a graven image his whole existence
was bound up in the regiment anything
beyond had no interest a good chap that
much tony granted a splendid soldier
none better a brave man but in some ways
strangely stupid
  shannon seated himself on a high-backed
chair at the opposite end of the table the
room was rather dark lit only by one dim
oil	lamp hanging from the ceiling red-hot
embers glowed in the small grate occa-
sionally ashes fell into the hearth in a cor-
ner wrapped in a blanket one of the other
subalterns was sleeping
  tony raised his eyes to find shannon
gazing at him with a puzzled expression
  arent you going to get any sleep to-
night tony he asked its latish you
know and were as likely as not to be routed
up by four
  dunno said tony im not tired
as a matter of fact im not sleeping very
well these nights
  huh shannon grunted why dont
you speak of it then eh you cant do much
if youre not sleeping you know
  for a minute or so there was silence in the
little room tony rested his chin on his
knuckles and gazed at the blue of the sky
that showed through the open window and
pondered
  why had shannon said that he could do
no good unless he slept did that mean
that he was in fact doing badly were
people talking of him behind his back
was the secret that he had guarded with
such jealous care common property in the
regiment had shannon known all along
that he had run from the germans in panic
had he known that his excuse of rallying
his men had been untrue perhaps even
now he pitied him
  he leaned forward seized with a sudden
determination to learn the worst
  would you mind if i asked you a ques-
tion sir its rather important
  ask away son nothing wrong is
there
  well-well- tony reddened it was
harder than he had expected well sir
its this how do you think im doing
i think youre doing very well said
shannon deliberately very well indeed 
tony considered the answer was satis-
factory as far as it went did it go far
enough
  have you seen anything to make you
think i dont care for fighting sir or that
im afraid when were in action
afraid said shannon nonsense
but to himself he said now whats he
driving at what is it hes trying to tell me-
sometimes said tony i think im
scared
  nine-tenths of the men who go under
fire for the first time are
  then you wouldnt call me a coward
persisted tony
  shannon frowned
  what the devils wrong with you to-
night tony a coward no dont be
an idiot youre as good as any man in the
regiment ill tell you one thing though
and that is-
  he shot a quick glance at tony you
dont mind my speaking plainly do you 
very glad sir if you would said tony
and his heart began to beat a trifle faster
but now that his doubts were set at ret
shannon might say whatever he choose
compared with what he had thought noth-
ing mattered
  im not quite sure what it is continued
shannon or whether indeed its anything
at all but you give the impression tony
of-well of not being interested in vour
work
  tony nodded nervously
  im interested enough in a way he
stopped short wondering what in the world
shannon meant not interested i dont
quite understand he said i shouldn t
like the war to go on forever sir of course
nobody would said shannon dryly
its the uselessness of the whole thing
that i hate most said tony
 
adventure
  is that the sum total of your impres-
sions asked shannon id like to know
what you really do think about it
  it s hard to say said tony and he felt
rather uncomfortable and ill at ease im
a soldier and  have to light that i know
but-why should i have to kill germans
i dont hate them all i can think of in
action is that the men were pumping lead
into the men who are try ing to attack us
and are being wiped out are men like we
are that there are wives in germany wait-
ing for news-wives and mothers and
daughters-just as sybil at home waits
for news of me poor devils it makes me
sick to see the way they go down when they
attack in those masses of theirs its mur-
der poor wretched conscripts and being
driven on by their officers youve seen
them eh like tattle being driven to the
slaughter-house why he ended ab-
ruptly
  shannon was bewildered out of his
depth
  dyou mean to tell me tony mallagh
that you go into action with thoughts like
those good lord man its a mystery to
me you dont take to your heels and bolt
he saw the sudden shame and fear in tonys
face and hurried on dont you realize
that those fathers and husbands and broth-
ers of yours are doing their darndest to kill
you and me and the rest of us you kill or
be killed theres no other alternative
d you think theyd have any mercy on
you just because youve a wife at home
  no-o said tony doubtfully of
course not
  there came into shannons mind the
memory of the conversation he had over-
heard some nights before
  tony he said wars not a game
its dead earnest theres only one way
to end it quickly and thats by smashing the
men were fighting half measures wont
do youre too - casual about it i
wonder what youd be like if you got angry
if youre thinking how hard it is on the
germans to be wiped out by our chaps
youll never do any good
  and tony remember this though
youre in france youre fighting to keep the
germans out of your own country and
youre lighting for sybil and if youll take
my advice youll get angry and fight as if
every german was a personal particular
enemy of your own who was trying to smash
up your home and all that you have if
you do that if you once lose your temper
and see red well-remembering the story
of the greengrocers horse and the light at
portsmouth youll be hard to beat
  tony sighed a trifle wearily shannon
had meant to be kind of course but he
didnt understand how could he
  as for the advice he had given it was use-
less had he not enough to do as it was
without worrying his head about matters
of no importance with heartfelt thankful-
ness he realized that his secret was safe
but for how long the foe that he fought
was not the german army neither horse
nor foot nor guns but himself would the
day ever come when he could claim the
victory the knowledge of what he really
was sickened him for sybils sake he must
live for sybils sake he must overcome his
fear
  he laughed abruptly and then forced a
yawn
  lord im tired i think ill turn in
sir it was awfullyr good of you to ha e tol l
me all that ill remember he stood up
and collected his b elongings   hope there 
be a mail soon again its like heaven
hearing from home occasionally thats
the worst of being out here-youre lost
  and the last thing he saw as he dropped
off to sleep was shannon seated in the high-
backed chair his elbows on the table his
head propped by his hands as one deep in
thought
chapter vi
the harvest
in the three days that followed
though the battle continued with un-
abated fury stretching over a vast frontage
the south irish fusiliers saw but little of
the actual fighting being in reserve for
this tony was devoutly thankful the rest
put fresh heart into him
  and then one morning when the mists
were fading before the sun a platoon was
sent forward to reconnoitre and occupy a
hill thus it was that shortly before noon
tony mallagh saw from the slope of the
thickly-wooded ridge the small valley and
the farm and remembered once more the
woman who had reminded him of sybil
  i wonder if thereve been anyr germans
around since we were here last he said and
a corporal standing near him shook his head
lieutenant tony mallagh

   by the luk of the house sorr tis the
same
   maybe it is said tony but it might
be worth our while making sure
  they pushed their way through thickets
and tangled undergrowth under the shade
of tall oaks as fair and full of gods glory
as if the grim carnage of war were but a
mortal dream until in a clearing lit by the
sun half-way down the hill they came
across a man who lay on his back a high-
lander liis blind eyes staring up into the
blue his face set in a mocking smile a line
of blood marking his last lonely pilgrimage
on earth
  tony shivered the men had halted and
were waiting uncertain peering through
the screen of trees
  now i wonder said tony half to him-
self i wonder what brought him here
poor devil
   he wasnt killed here sorr said tel-
ford it was on the top of the hill he was
wounded he came to the valley to die
maybe he was makin for the farrm
   tony glanced over his shoulder
  corporal birkett ill get you and
oconnor you to go forward and see if
theres any sign of the enemy there wont
be they couldnt have got in here or
wed have seen em but well make sure
well wait at the edge of the field and have
you covered in case- understand
  they watched the two men crossing the
yellow stubble everything was very still
the farm seemed even more desolate and
forsaken than it had been the first time they
had seen it a heavy silence seemed to
brood over the whole place a silence that
was broken at intervals by the crash and
re-echoing roar of artillery
  telford uttered a sudden half-choked
exclamation
   luk there sorr at the top of the roof
will ye theres a piece thats missin
mi- was lere no chimney at a at
  the two scouts had reached the door of
the house and it seemed to tony a dull
anxiety numbing his heart that they
started back in horror
  come on he said there are no ger-
mans there anyhow and he hastened
on down the slope in the direction of the
farm outstripping his men
  at the little gate leading to the front
garden oconnor made as if to stop him
   sorr theres nothin lift-nothin
  with a curt nod tony passed on and
stood at the doorway peering in at what
had only a few short days before been the
kitchen
  he felt as if some power had robbed him
of his senses he saw but he could not at-
tach any meaning to what was before his
eyes the effect was clear the cause was
lacking
   the ceiling and part of the wall opposite
had gone the blue sky and the green trees
and a shattered bam showed in the gap
the floor once so white and clean was cov-
ered with debris rubble and plaster and
brick and woodwork the table in the
center of the room was broken the oak
dresser stood to all appearance undamaged
but its neat rows of crockery ware the cups
and saucers and dishes and jugs had been
cast down as if by some gigantic hand
obeying some devils -will
   tony shook off the stupor that bound him
and entered
  against the stove crumpled up like a
bundle of old clothes discarded after years
of use thrown carelessly aside was the little
old man the womans father the stone
hearth smeared and splashed with dried
blood
   tony stared at him with a feeling of cold
fear gripping his heart nor could he have
spoken had he been ordered
  there were footsteps behind him he
turned and saw telford
  god dheliver us theyre afther shel-
lin kthe place then-then then what in the
name of all thats howly-whats become
of the woman what give us the dhrink
  through the open doorway on his left
tony could see a pile of rubbish like that
in the room in which he now stood bricks
and mortar and beams of wood with a
glimpse of the farmyard the dark green
of the trees and the slope of the hill beyond
taking the place of the wall which was once
there
  nerving himself to do his duty he en-
tered
   on her knees crouching by the side of a
big old-fashioned bed was the woman
her whole attitude beokened terror a
terror that was far beyond her strength to
bear her face was turned away hidden
from view her shoulders were bowed in
her arms she held her baby with one hand
shielding its head

adventure
  tony approached softly spoke to her in
a husky voice then touched her she did
not move great beads of perspiration
trickled down his cheeks his tongue clove
to the roof of his mouth and at last by an
effort he found his voice
  what is it he asked hoarsely what
is it tell me cant you
  he tugged at her arm tugged and tugged
until unresisting strangely limp she moved
and he saw her face her cheeks were pale
her eyes closed her white teeth pressed
into her lower lip and under the mass of
heavy golden hair hair that was so like
sybils-sybil waiting at home for news
of him-was red blood blood that had
trickled down over her forehead down her
other cheek on to the bed
  unable to bear the sight tony dropped
her arm and turned away his men
watched him with curious eyes silent ap-
prehensive
  god he whispered oh my god
did you see her did you see what theyve
done
  what is it misther mallagh said
telford ah dont now dont let it be
disturrbin ye poor things sure an
theyre out of harrms way an with their
throubles inded
  both of them said tony both
it was the one shell that did it the one
shell telford do you hear me oh my
god lets get out of it and they wouldnt
leave when i told them telford you heard
yourself didnt you it isnt my fault it
isnt is it
  he staggered out of the ruined house into
the open air shaking in every limb his
senses reeling
  the farm-yard was wrecked beyond re-
pairing barns and out-houses were crum-
bling ruins a few melancholy hens wan-
dered to and fro a horse lay dead by the
well its legs stretched stiffly out 
  oconnor approached slowly a dead
rooster in one hand his rifle in the other his
red dirty face strangely serious
  sorr was there not a little gcrrl as well
he asked
  well said tony sharply well
  i think sorr that we have found her
  alive
  the man gave a hard laugh sorr she
is not alive mother of jasus would ye
say that if ved seen her she was fright-
ened poor little gerrl an ran for yer
pace of mind this night sorr an for manny
a night afther yell have no wish to luk
does a shell give life or beauty where it
burrshts
  ive seen enough said tony ive
seen enough theres no mercy in war not
in tins war they lake them all-men
women and even the children is there one
that theyd spare he turned on his heel
and went wearily back to the house
sergeant-major
  sorr said telford
  theyve gone all of them
  the little gerrl sorr
   yes he paused telford i think
ill leave you here while i go on with a
dozen or so men to the top of the hill i
just want to-to have a look the other side
of the ridge youd better follow me as
soon as youve-youve-
  he broke short abruptly his head was
throbbing as with fever he felt sick and
dazed thoughts came and went haphaz-
ard a fierce anger burned within him a
hatred of war a horror of what he had seen
for he knew as surely as if he had been
told that never while he had life in his
body-never sleeping or waking uld he
forget would he shut out of mind the things
he had seen that day and this was war-
war the magnificent war that men wor-
shiped
  the sergeant-major was looking at him
with a curious intensity of gaze he shiv-
ered as if chilled to the bone
  maybe youll find some spades and picks
in the barn he said or whats left of it
-and-and any wherell do for the grave
telford anywhere you like
the souui irish were bivouacking
in an orchard near a small illage
an unwonted cheerfulness seemed to
have taken possession of the men there
were rumors coming from where no man
knew that in the morning the regiment was
to be sent into action with the remainder of
the division
  to tony mallagh sick at heart tortured
by his own imaginings pacing to and fro
by himself came shannon
  tony i want to speak to you
  tony halted
  well he said slowly what is it
  the light of a fire threw a red reflection
on to his worn face shannon stared at
him puzzled by his appearance he looked
 if
 
lieutenant tony mallagh

ill all the life and strength and resolution
seemed to have vanished
  hullo hullo whats all this whats
the matter tony
  the matter tony answered in a dull
voice the matter sir nothing
  the older man took him by the arm
yes there is he said better tell me
perhaps i can help
  tony laughed softly help the very
idea amused him shannon he said
dropping his voice im sick of it thats
whats the matter im sick of everything
there
  shannon whistled under his breath
steady the buffs come on tony
what is it
  tony gazing across the open fields at the
distant hills dark against the blue-gray sky
wondered if it were over those same hills
that the south irish were destined to fight
their way on the morrow
  there was a farmhouse in a small val-
ley he said i was there three days ago
i dont know when ive seen any place i
liked so much-green woods yellow corn-
fields a farmhouse covered with ivy an
orchard the man was away fighting the
wife looked after the farm you under-
stand sib she did all the work everything
and wasnt frightened she had an old
father a cripple and two kiddies the
germans wouldnt harm her she knew
and she was as happy and busy as if there
were no war within a hundred miles and
then today-
  well said shannon quietly to-
day
  today said tony we went that
way again the back of the house was
blown to pieces a batten had had the
wrong range or something even the air-
men might have spotted the farm or
they might have thought- oh god
knows i dont i darent think of it too
much the old man was dead so was the
woman she had her arms around her baby
to save it from the shells the baby was
dead and in the garden was the little girl
they didnt let me see her she was dead
of course oh yes she was dead right
enough i hat s what we found when we
passed there today
  and me-god forgive me thereve
been times when i thought that war brought
out all that was best in man today- he
shipped his fingers-today shannon i
understood what war was theyd gone
each one of them wiped out smashed
and at the end of the war perhaps the
husband will come home to find-what
nothing only the grave and a wooden
cross
  but tony listen in spite of himself
shannon was troubled tony you know
what war is by this time dont you its
cruel yes but-
 cruel said tony so it seems
shannon i wish you could have seen that
poor girl today with the shell wound in her
head and her arms around her poor dead
baby what harm had she done none
at all she thought she was safe whod
touch a poor woman who had to work hard
god would preserve her thats what she
said and a battery two miles away per-
haps killed her
  ill never forget shannon never
and shannon when i saw her that first
time it came over me that she looked like
sybil yes its a fact like sybil that
makes it worse wars killing women and
little children and old men shells dropping
on little houses whats it matter to us
we re men and were strong wars good
it gives us a chance to win medals and y
cs and quick promotion but the women
-god help them no one else will and
perhaps a home in london sybil is won-
dering if im alive or dead or-what and
-i dunno i feel that my nerves broken for
good and all im done
  as bad as that old chap  shannon
patted his shoulder tony its no use
fretting youve got to turn in and-and
youll be feeling better in the morning you
see if you arent wars war old son-
  something seemed to snap in tonys
brain he laughed harshly and walked oil
leaving the other staring after him bewil-
dered and worried and somewhat frightened
by his manner
  a square thick-set figure passed him by
  is that you telford
  sorr the company sergeant-major
saluted
  telford whats happened  mr mal-
lagh
  he was all right this afthernoon sorr
said telford
  you noticed nothing different about
him then
  well sorr mebbe he was a bit quiet
like aithcr we seen where the gemnans had
adventure
dhropped a few shells on top of a house
an  dont wondher it wasnt a sight ye
could luk at an not feel sorr
  oh i see thank you telford it
doesnt matter i thought perhaps he was
sick thats all
  the sergeant-major drifted off for
some minutes shannon did not move and
as he pondered on what tony mallagh had
said there came to his mind the thought of
sybil waiting at home and the memory of
the evening when they had sat opposite
each other in the small drawing-room and he
had heard from her own lips why she had
wanted him little more than a month
had passed since then it seemed impossi-
ble whole years could not have made
more difference to her husband and the
future
  at that moment the future seemed to
shannon dark and dreary full of misery
and doubt and uncertainty supposing
that on the morrow when the south irish
went into action tony were once more to
show himself a coward supposing that this
time there would be no hiding it from others
supposing he turned and ran not in the
gray of the dawn but in broad day in full
view of his company supposing he ran
and lived would even sybil consider his
life worth the price he would have to pay
   yet if ever a man had showed fear in his
words and looks and manner thatman was
tony mallagh
chapter vii
the honor of the south irish
to the man who does the actual fight-
ing who goes into the firing-line and
with rifle and bayonet endeavors to drive
back the foe a battle is but a grim dream
incoherent and vague a series of discon-
nected incidents his range of observation
is limited he knows what is happening in
his immediate neighborhood and nowhere
else his regiment or brigade may be
hurled forward in a fierce onslaught their
losses may appal him-surely this is the
hardest fighting that man has ever seen-
yet the attack may be but a feint a mere
pretense to cover the real attack elsewhere
  he and his comrades may be sacrificed
so that others may win he may be ordered
to advance and retire and then to advance
once more to all appearance without rea-
son and what he may think a defeat
judging from what he has seen with his own
eyes from the losses in his own regiment or
company may be as great a victory as ever
army won
  thus it was with the men of the south
irish for although they were in the firing
line one of the leading regiments in the
movement they knew but little of what was
happening even in their own immediate
front
  by noon they had reached the shelter of a
wood where they were told to wait later
the german field-guns opened a heavy fire
a few men were killed and a few more
wounded and the stretcher-bearers were
busy
  murmurs came from the ranks
  the curse of cromwell on all gerrmans
where are they now why is there nothin
to be shootin at
  are we niver to go forward at all
  sure its naythur shell-fire nor muketh-
ry nor yit charrgin thats the worrt part of
bein in acthion tis the iverlastin seuin
around doin nothin that wears a man more
than annything
  shannon came hurrying up just as a shell
burst among the trees some yards in front
of where a dozen or so privates were lying
they rose to their feet as one man and rn
back one fell on his face and did not move
from the enemys position in front the
crackle of musketry broke out bullets were
wailing and whistling through the air with
the sound as of a swarm of monstrous ilies
a bugler coughed and slid over into a limp
heap
  where are you men going asked shan-
non sternly get back at once do you
hear get back right back now they
moved sullenly to where they had been
waiting
  shannon wondering if anything had hap-
pened to tony mallagh let his eyes wander
quickly from side to side the men lay in a
natural gully or ditch that zigzagged along
the slope of the hill some talked in low
voices others puffed at their pipes in si-
lence a few unmindful of the bullets dozed
the sky showed blue in the gaps of the green
overhead through the trees wrere glimpses
of meadows and cornfields and woods held
by the enemy all faint and flickering in the
heat haze
  shannon turned impatiently two men
were carrying the wounded bugler away on
lieutenant tony mallagh
   a stretcher he watched them with a little
   frown and then he saw the man for whom
   he had been looking
     seated on a fallen tree-trunk some little
   distance behind the line of waiting soldiers
   his shoulders bowed his chin resting on the
   palm of his right hand his elbow resting
   on his knees was tony mallagh
     shannon stirred at last to take action
   strode toward him
     tony raised his head as he came up his
   face was gray under the brown worn and
   wretched lines showed about his eyes and
   mouth his whole appearance gave the im-
   pression of fear fear that had left him with-
   out energy or strength of mind or so it
   seemed to shannon
     tony he said and he spoke in a whis-
   per so that no one might overhear what
   the devil are you doing here why arent
   you looking after your men dont you
   know that theyre under fire and getting
   restless whats wrong with you shan-
   nons anger flared up white-hot only by
   an effort could he control his voice if
    youre a coward for heavens sake dont
   let the men see it pull yourself together
   man dont you understand what im say-
   ing
     the words were strong but no stronger
  than the case warranted the time for
  sympathy had gone by only shame the
  sense that others had guessed his secret
  would drive tony to do his duty better
  by far to lose a friend than that that friend
  should lose the respect not only of others
  but of himself and if what he said had no
  effect then nothing would the case was
  hopeless
     tony stood up slowly and gazed about
  him in a dazed way as if he had not grasped
  the meaning of what was said to him
      i ve done nothing have i he muttered
     nothing shannon dug his heel into
  the soft moss covered with pine-needles
  thats just it youve done nothing
  we re going forward presently to take that
  village and youve-well got to set an
  example see if youre too scared to do
  whats right how the blazes do you expect
  your men to
     tony understood shannon poor dense
  fool thought that he shirked the fight he
  tony mallagh afraid he laughed after
  seeing the house with the dead woman who
  had looked like sybil he was a soldier
  ghting for his home for the girl who was
dearer to him than anything in the wide
world
  you dont think im afraid do you
shannon he said
  yes said shannon bluntly  do
and man think of sybil its for her sake
tony as much as ours how would she like
to hear that when you were wanted you
failed
   tony was smiling his head slightly tilted
on one side
  so you think im afraid do you good
god after what i saw yesterday why
man all that im afraid of is that the ger-
mans maynt wait thats all and you
think im a coward do you why his
eyes glinted with a curious anger be-
cause of what i was fool enough to tell
you
  because of a good many things your
looks to start with i saw you looking like
you are now once before i never told you
i never intended to tell you but i must
you remember that morning when some of
our fellows bolted and i picked you up with
your head all cut tony you were running
then if youd only been trying to rally
the men youd have been back long before
you got as far as all that understand
thats why im frightened now because
you look the same as you did then
  all right said tony sorry if ive
made you think im worse than i am i did
run that time i know dont judge me
though by what i was then maybe you
think that im still a coward i think-
here he laughed lightly-i think that ill
prove youre wrong and im going to
prove it for sybils sake as much as my
own
  well and good said shannon im
glad to hear it
  you remember the greengrocers horse
said tony
  well whats that got to do with it
  oh nothing said tony nothing
  shannon turned and walked off feeling
dissatisfied and worried and for the moment
not quite certain that he had taken the right
course he had angered tony he knew and
hurt him yet he had fio great hope that
what he had said would awaken a sense of
duty
  when he had gone some little distance
he looked back tony was standing in the
same attitude head on one side hands
behind his back staring after him
adventure
after the days fight was over
the general in command of the
division rode up and congratulated
the suuth irish fusiliers or what remained
of them they had achieved what in other
wars would have been deemed the impossi-
ble the sacrifice they had made had not
been in vain he was proud to remember
so he said that he himself had served in
their ranks
  and the remnants of the regiment a
bare two hundred and fifty men ragged and
war-worn and tired stood to attention in
the streets of a battered village and felt
very proud of themselves and very hungry
and very thirsty as for what they had
done that was nothing they had fought
and driven the enemy before them as they
had promised always if the chance were
given them
  if the general was surprised they at
least w-ere not were they not the royal
south irish fusiliers-the tipperary ti-
gers in their hearts they pitied the ger-
mans who had had to face their onslaught
poor fools did they think they could
withstand an irish regiment with the
bayonet
  in the last wild rush when they had been
launched across open ground at the enemys
trenches with their bayonets glinting in the
yellow evening sunshine the deep roar of
their cheering swelling loud above the crack-
le of musketry carried a message both to
friend and foe the south irish fusiliers
were charging a savage exultant yell told
that they had met the germans and that
the trench was theirs and the regiments on
either side line after line took up the
shout and dashed forward to do their share
  but as the south irish put it we
was the fellas that showed thim the way
an it was misther mallagh what made us
do what we did
  ah an what kind of madness wras it
that dhrove him on
  himself knows did ye see him whin he
came back and sthud with the bullets whist-
lin all round him as cool as ye plaze an
axed if we was wishin to live foriver an
was it a tay-parthy or a battle we wanted
a gran young orfcer an no mistake
indade an ye sphake no more than the
thruth but it was not a tay-parthy a man
wants more than wance in a lifetime the
cosht was a dale too high
  they had lost heavily from the very mo-
ment that the word had sent them forward
out of the shelter of the wood toward the
germans their advance through the
harvest fields and meadows and orchards
had been stubbornly contested they lost
their colonel shot through the lungs a
major two captains and three subalterns
no more than six officers unwounded
survived
  and always in the very forefront of the
battle went tony mallagh no longer carry-
ing a sword but a rifle and bayonet fierce
in attack savagely intolerant of delay
stern implacable and disdainful of life
  once when the regiment had carried a
village after fierce hand-to-hand fighting in
the streets and houses and the men of his
company had swarmed around him cheer-
ing wildly he had glared at them with cold
eyes and growled angrily like some dog
robbed of a bone the stupor of battle
which is worse than drunkeness held him
in its grip did they know that the were
wasting time or not he had said were
they tired of being soldiers or what
would they like their tea and cakes now or
would they wait till later when the table
was laid and their bibs were ironed
  all these things and others were remem-
bered of him after he had led the last charge
  late in the afternoon the brigade crossed
a stream in the face of heavy fire and went
forward driving the germans before them
through the trees
  the sun was setting by the time they had
cleared the wood of its defenders
  a strange hush had fallen on the field of
battle a hush that w-as broken only by the
incessant roar of the guns yet the men of
the south irish streaming onward grimly
silent knew that the real struggle was still
before them
  at the edge of the wood they found in
front of them a stretch of open ground slop-
ing slightly upward bare of all cover and a
fierce storm of bullets from the hedgerows
and orchards and houses swept their ranks
  they fell back in disorder to the shelter
of the trees urged to fresh effort by their
officers they poured in volley after volley
and started forward once more only to
waver and break and go back leaving be-
hind their dead german marksmanship
they despised but this hell of fire from rifles
and machine-guns wfas more than man bom
of woman could face and live or so they
had thought all that soldiers could do they
lieutenant tony mallagh

had done they must wait for reinforce-
ments
  but this time tony mallagh bare-
headed grimed with sweat and dirt but as
cool and calm as on parade smiling a little
so men said later when they talked it over
did not retire with his company he stood
by himself a mark for a half-score of
machine-guns perhaps more and rifles
without number upright in the midst of
the fallen
  the men had watched him wondering
when would come the bullet that would lay
him low some had shouted for him to get
back that he would be killed that they
themselves could not shoot for fear of
hitting him
   are you afraid then south irish be
had laughed do you want german con-
scripts to boast that they licked you in fair
fight are you so fond of your miserable
carcases here he had raised his hand to
his face and they had seen the red smear of
blood again he had laughed good-by
then id be ashamed to be seen dead in
the company of a pack of-cowards like
you are and you call yourself irish im
proud to know that youll not go where im
going
   he turned with a little gesture of con-
tempt and walked deliberately toward the
enemy rifle in hand
  a young subaltern shouted dont let
him go alone south irish jumping to his
feet he started after him but fell with a
bullet through his heart a dozen men fol-
lowed
r one after another they dropped
and after that not even discipline
nt even direct orders from their
officers would have held back the south
irish cowards were they they would
prove that whatever they might be they
were far from being cowards
  as they went forward with the wild
savage yell that gave warning far and wide
of the coming of the bayonets tony mal-
agh glanced back over his shoulder and
laughed then he began to run
   men fell by scores in the rush across the
open he was not touched neither
machine-guns nor rifles brought him down
bleeding from his wound he reached the
german position well in advance of the
nearest man using both the butt of his
rifle and his bayonet he fought his way into
the trench a swarm of gray-clad figures
seemed to rise up and engulf him and
that was the last seen of tony mallagh for
some time
  like a wave breaking on a rock-bound
shore the south irish burst through the
enemy those that awaited their coming
died those that fled they chased through
the streets of the little village a few es-
caped but not many it was a fight after
their own hearts a great and glorious fight
that the south irish fusiliers existed no
longer save as a mere fragment of a battal-
ion mattered not no other troops could
have done what they had done they were
proud of themselves and justly
  telford and a couple of wounded privates
found tony mallagh under a pile of corpses
in the orchard at the back of the trench
   hes dead poor fella
  indade an hes not not yit at laste
mother of god luk at the wounds that
he has
  tony opened his eyes as shannon came
up through the trees he dropped on to his
knees by tonys side
  tony old man are you badly hurt
  hurt- whispered tony no
  he lay on the grass under the trees his
head in telfords lap and seeing him
there was no one present who did not know
what the end must be
  take it aisy sorr therell be a docthor
along in a minute
  oh tony tony said shannon bit-
terly
  ssh whats that from their left
came a deep roar of cheers
  theyre afther takin another trinch
said telford that ull be the cumber-
lands
  shannon said tony i cant live li
know i want to and yet-yet somehow
i dont it was the house and the woman
who was killed-remember and the green-
grocers horse at portsmouth his mind
seemed to be wandering
  not long now muttered telford
not very long poor bhov
  for a while no one spoke the cheering
had died down only the sullen boom of
the field-guns thudded on the sun had
set and the sky was a brilliant crimson over
the hills another regiment was passing
rank after rank of dark figures against the
bluish-gray of the trees the dying man
stirred uneasily and shannon bent nearer
adventure
so that he might catch the least whisper
  i wasnt afraid shannon was  
wasnt this time at least i was before
though
  afraid said shannon i never saw
anything so splendid in all my life we
wouldnt have won the trench but for you
tony we couldnt have
  somethings fretting him said telford
  tony said shannon suddenly is
there any message for-for sybil
  sybil said tony sybil he stared
at shannon with a look of doubt almost as
if the words he had heard held no meaning
  yes is there nothing i can do
surely he would be thinking of sybil think-
ing and wondering and worrying surely
it would help him if he knew that any mes-
sage he might give would reach her shell
be very proud of you tony he said
  a wistful little smile crept into tonys
face
  dont you understand shannon ill be
seeing her myself ill tell her-yes ill
tell her everything good and bad eh
shell be glad wont she
  shannon caught his breath sharply poor
old tony he was going out at last then
did he think though that he could live to
see sybil
  hes wandherin a thrifle whispered
telford
  no one spoke the end was very near
then with ari effort tony tried to raise him-
self a gleam of amusement showed in his
tired eyes
  dirty work fighting he murmured
glad i didnt order a new kit eh he
closed his eyes
  the little group waited for a while in si-
lence then telford lowered the boys
head on to the grass
  hes gone he said an but for him
we wouldnt be where we are now
  god help the girl said shannon
hoarsely its hard on her awful hard
poor old tony
  a subaltern with a bandaged face hurried
toward them
  is captain shannon there he called
  well said shannon
  the generals coming this way sir so
i thought id tell you you see sir major
carnes wounded and youre the senior
surviving officer and-
  ah right said shannon wearily he
stood up i wont be a minute
  one of the privates stooped down and
gazed into tonys face
  poor young fella hi- was happy whin
he wint wesht luk at the smile on him
wud he belaive he was afther doin all
what he has done
  weve losht heavily this day path-
rick said another but theres none we
cud have spared the liss than this wan
  i worldlier did they hear the banshee
lasht night in kerry himself comes from
kerry i know
  tony mallagh was buried where he had
fallen in the orchard it was a starlit night
the guns had ceased a cool wind blew
from the north
  sick at heart shannon turned from the
grave it would be very lonely without
tony mallagh never before had he real-
ized what tony had been to him some-
thing had gone out of his life something
that could never be replaced and then he
remembered sybil
  the thought of what the news of ton- s
death would mean to her was like a kniie-
thrust in the heart had he done al in hi
power to keep the promise he hu i made
had he tried to do his best to save h- r
husband from running into danger ha
he not rather sent him to his death shan -
non pondered
  it had been no feeling of cowardice that
had gripped tony that morning he knew
rather a dumb loathing of inaction but
supposing that it had been fear supposing
that tony had deserted his men in battle
supposing that sybil had heard would
life have been worth living for her or for
him
ztpn war was glorious war was great
fjt and war was hell but tony mal-
jagh was dead and sybil must be
told and from him shannon who would
have given all he possessed to win her grati-
tude and thanks must come the news
  he entered the little house in the village
where he was to spend the night the room
still bore the marks of fighting on the
boards were dark stains bullet holes
scarred the plaster of the walls german
rifles and helmets lay in one corner a sol-
dier servant was lighting a lamp
  shannon seated himself at the table and
searched in his pockets for pen and writing-
tablet
  if he must write it would be as well to
lieutenant tony mallagh

write while he had the chance tomorrow
it might be his turn to die waiting would
only postpone the agony then he wrote
dear mrs mallagh
   i am sitting in a little french cottage in a village
which the south irish have just carried at the point
of the bayonet writing a letter that will bring jou
the iaddest news you have ever had
  tony is dead he died a glorious death but
for him we wouldnever have taken the position
  and what else could he say shannon
stared blindly at the white paper before him
a subaltern came slowly toward the table
lord im done in
  shannon looked at him
  tired eh you did well today very
well
  the boys face flushed under the mask of
dirt
 thank you sir but of course-we
none of us did very much compared with
poor old ton my hat that was great
i never saw anything like it he told me
this morning early while we were in that
wood that he didnt think hed ever see an-
other sunset said something seemed to
tell him that he wasnt meant to live and
there was something about a house that
hed seen and a woman who was killed i
dunno i think it had got on his nerves and
all he wanted to do was to kill germans
queer wasnt it
  dont understand dont understand
at all said shannon and he died know-
ing his wife was at home waiting he was
all she had in the world-and now hes taken
away from her rough luck on her though
it always is on the women-always
  poor old tony said the boy ill
never forget never the way he walked off
by himself as cool as you please and then
iaughed when he found we were coming
after him
  the regimental quartermaster a stout
square-shouldered round-faced little man
bustled in
  hullo obrien said shannon where
on earth have you come from
  the little man was angry
  isnt it my luck at all another fight
the besht of the lot an me out of it fooling
about afther supplies theyre saying
though that half the battalions wiped out
is that so
  yes shannon nodded drearily we
dont know for certain yet the colonels
gone im the senior officer left
  the quartermaster dropped into a chair
  an me out of it all id have given a
months pay to be in it an ye charrged
across open ground did you an took their
trench well well
  we wouldnt have done it but for tony
mallagh though said the subaltern
  you dont say said the quartermaster
and he listened with wide open eyes while
the story was told at its finish he brought
his hand down with a crash on to the table
god thats the bravest thing that i ever
heard tell of will they give him the cross
do ye think to his wife i mean he de-
serves it an me out of it all its a
shame
  the litue mans grief was very real
  shannon turned once more to his writ-
ing
  oh by the same token ive some let-
ters here which i brought with me he
took out a small packet theres one for
captain shannon two for-yes yes one
for-
 any for me asked the subaltern
quickly two good biz
  an said the quartermaster heres
wan that i have for tony mallagh himself
what had i better do with it he passed
it over to shannon
  the handwriting seemed strangely fa-
miliar suannon frowned as he tried to re-
member where he had seen it before an-
other letter lying on the table caught his
eye
  its the same as this isnt it he said
why good lord its from mrs carne
did i tell you her husband was wounded
obrien was there no letter for tony from
his wife-no other letter at all
  not so far as im aware said the
quartermaster nothin more for the
mess at all save some parcels that are corn-
in on later
  shannon felt as if a cold hand had touched
his heart
  i dont know he said i dont know
but i dont like it he paused look
here im going to open this letter and see
what it says im writing to mrs mal-
lagh now you seeand-
  he opened the envelope with clumsy
fingers
  for a brief moment he could not see to
read the words were all blurred and un-
certain then the mist cleared and a sick
horror came over him

adventure
  it was not a long letter just a few lines
that were to have brought grief and sad-
ness and suffering the greatest he would
ever know to tony mallagh sybil was
dead the illness had been short indeed
there had been no illness at all she had
said she was tired and had lain down on her
bed to rest later when they came to look
for her she was dead so the majors wife
had written she grieved more than she
could say she knew what it would mean
to one so fur away yet she had thought it
her duty to write
  the letter fell from shannons lingers on
to the floor he stared blindly across the
room seeing nothing only the face of the
girl whom he had loved smiling tenderly
with her blue eyes full of sadness and pity
  he rested his head in his hands and tried
to think
  some one touched him on the shoulder
a voice spoke to him
  why wouldnt they leave him alone
couldnt they see that his heart was bro-
ken didnt they know that the girl-the
sweetest and dearest girl in the world was
dead
  and then something seemed to rise up and
choke him sybil was dead yes but
would that make any difference-to him
why she was tonys wife and nothing
to him at all her husband was dead and
she was dead and no one could wish ihings
different from what they were and tony
-tony had said that he would see her soon
that there was no message why had he
know n just at the last or what
  shannon lowered his hands
  yes he said huskily yes did you
say anything
  is it bad news you have in the letter
asked the little quartermaster youre
lookin ill
  bad said shannon fiercely bad
good god no why its the best news
ive ever had in my life sybil-tony mal-
laghs wife is dead you understand shes
dead and im glad
  he rose to his feet and walked slowly out
into the darkness
an
occasional
hero
m j vihtman
t may have been his unkempt
appearance or it may have
been the slouch in his manner
as he casually supervised the
work of a gang of filipino truckmen per-
haps it was a combination of the two which
irritated white the chief of the lighthouse
service
  wtiy do you hire such fellows he snap-
ped indicating with slight backward nod
of his head the lanky american in dirty
khaki
  farley the assistant purchasing agent
followed with his glance the direction of
whites nod
  oh he said partly because we need
m
an occasional hero

them and partly because this bureau is a
sort of charity organization that particu-
lar one cropsey was wished on us by the
governor-generals office hes an ex-sol-
dier and not a bad sort hes been here
for a couple of months and hasnt gotten
drunk yet
   whites blue eyes glinted
   they dont wish any of them off on me
he said ill have no beach-combers on
my pay-roll and i indicated as much to
calvin when he sent his first one down he
hasnt tried it since
  they were young men as are most work-
ers in those tropical islands where at forty
a man usually begins to show unmistakable
signs of wearing out and they both gave
an impression of self-reliance and absorbing
interest in their work but here the resem-
blance ended farley radiated a good na-
ture which would make allowances white
demanded of others the machine-like effi-
ciency which characterized his own work
  and thats the reason you hold us up
now and then in our supplies he said
you cant do good work with cheap tools
farleys reply was interrupted by the ar-
rival of a motor-car the panels of whose
doors were emblazoned with the eagle-top-
ped shield of the government the two
men hurried toward it and a certain defer-
ence in their manner told that the genial-
faced man who descended was the govem-
or-general
   as white started to leave the governor
detained him with a hand on his shoulder
   i have just dropped in to pay a friendly
morning call he said come up with us
the three mounted the stairs to the
offices leaving cropsey the only white man
on the lower floor of the long concrete
building in which the government houses
its supplies
  he watched them go a faint flicker of
resentment in his manner they repre-
sented success prosperity an abundance of
the good things of life he failure-a man
who was hanging to its outskirts as it
were by the slender thread of a five-peso-a-
day job take that from him today to-
morrow he would be a beach-comber for
while with five pesos a day a man can live
m some comfort in manila eating the luke-
warm chow served by ah sing in his dingy
restaurant and sleeping in a cane-bottomed
bed in a musty room of one of the walled
city s rambling stone houses he can hardly
lay by enough for his hospital bills when
the inevitable sickness strikes him
  but if cropseys wage had been multi-
plied tenfold he would at the end of the
month have had little more to show for it
he was one of those men born never to
possess anything more substantial than a
roving spirit putting money into his pock-
ets was like pouring water into a barrel with
a hole in its bottom
  but there was something more than re-
sentment in his manner this morning
there was a vague uneasiness brought
about by his consciousness of having vio-
lated the rule of his bureau which admitted
of no exceptions and his sin was returning
to plague him with the purpose of saving
an extra trip to the powder magazine at
san juan he had hidden in the building a
small box of dynamite to be shipped that
afternoon together with some steel rods
to the engineers at work on the calao
bridge the box lay in an out-of-the-way
corner behind some bales of manila hemp
and straw-filled packing-cases
  while white and farley had been nosing
about the building he had been in terror
lest they should discover his infraction
which he knew would mean his summary
dismissal with a sigh of relief he had
watched them mount the stairs
  now he started for the box intending to
get rid of it at once but suddenly he
checked himself the governor-general
had gone up with them he would be coming
down at any moment for the governor did
not pay protracted calls
  cropsey scowled as he moved over to
the part of the building furthest away from
the hidden box a dull rage burned in his
heart he had the inefficient mans con-
tempt of rules he felt that he had been
trying to save the government time ancj
money and instead of receiving thanks for
his zeal he was in danger of losing his place
a man who is used to getting only rebuffs
from fortune becomes quick to see his griev-
ances he told himself that hereafter he
would do his work and no more absolutely
no more he almost wished that the box
would catch on fire and blow the building
with its occupants to kingdom come
  it was not in answer to cropseys wish
but because a brown longshoreman coming
in from the pier some forty yards from the
end of the building had not tossed away his
lighted cigarette until after he had passed

adventure
through the opening near the hemp that it
began to smolder and a spark slowly to
burn its way through the sacking to some
of the loose straw which had fallen from the
packing-cases
  the sound of the governors voice on the
stairway caused cropsey unconsciously to
glance over his shoulder toward the hidden
explosive tongues of llame were leaping
upward from the cases which crackled as
merrily as a christmas tire and over the
hemp bales a cloud of smoke was forming
for an instant cropsey gazed at
the fire incredulously and then
without a word he began running
through the building toward the blaze his
only feeling was one of resentment against
the length of the unpartitioned floor
  some one who had seen the fire at the
same moment raised the cry almost
abreast of cropsey farley followed by the
governor raced to turn the water into the
hose while white hurried to the pier to
summon the fire-launch
  with a sudden gasp as the hot air filled
his lungs cropsey hurled himself across
the smoldering hemp bales before him lay
the deadly box its sides were smoking
stooping quickly he lifted it in his arms
and began cautiously to make his way be-
tween the burning packing-cases
  the end of his solitary upper garment a
loose military coat brushing against one of
the cases took fire as the flame smote his
skin he staggered but in an instant he had
caught himself and moved forward with
jerky steps like a mechanical toy to the
sea now only a few paces distant
  through his bloodshot eyes he caught
sight of white running toward him down
the roadway
  get back you fool he shrieked in a
high sobbing voice
  something in his tone checked white
whose legs against the volition of his brain
moved him backward
  a moment more and cropsey felt beneath
his feet the rocks which formed the retain-
ing-wall of the sea down them he stag-
gered until the water came about his knees
then carefully laying the box in a crevice
of the rocks he plunged head-foremost into
the sea the awful searing of his back
ceased but the salt water stung him cruelly
  white hurrying forward to the mans as-
sistance saw as he clambered down the
rocks the box which lay harmless enough
beneath the quiet water and his practised
eye recognized it for what it was but he
did not pause
  here he said bending down and
stretching out one hand while the other
dung to a projecting ledge take hold
  cropsey seized the hand and was drawn
upward
  when they reached the roadway the blaze
was out and filipino laborers were gingerly
rolling the still smoking hemp bales across
the concrete floor to the open air where a
barefooted too played a stream of water
upon them
  the governor and farley who had seen
the incident without comprehending its
meaning met the pair as they approached
the building cropsey stood facing them
hatless begrimed and dirty but no one real-
ized that he had actually been on fire
  are you hurt inquired the governor
solicitously
  the feeling of resentment welied up in
cropsey intensified in its bitterness his
back was a live coal his lungs a glowing
bellows and this man was asking him
if he was hurt he shook his head sul-
lenly
  well then tell us why in the name of
all that is reasonable you rushed headlong
into that fire
  to cropsey the world had suddenly token
on the blur of a spinning top he clenched
his hands in his effort to maintain bis foot-
ing but still he did not answer
  ill tell you why white cut in crisply
to get a box of dynamite perhaps he will
tell us what it was doing there
  the governors ruddy cheeks paled
slightly and he drew a step nearer the fore-
man
  you did that he asked a new note of
respect in liis voice
  cropsey made no reply instead he fell
forward limply as his legs crumpled under
him into the governors arms which auto-
matically opened to receive him
  beneath his hands the governor felt the
mans bare skin
  get me my car quick and here farley
you help me he shouted and as a mo-
ment later the car shot forward with the
unconscious man supported between then
he called to white telephone them i am
coming
  as they raced through the level streets
an occasional hero

ihe governor turned a puzzled look on the
man resting against his shoulder
  where did you get him he asked far-
ley in a low voice
  and when farley told him that the man
had come with a note from calvin asking
that he be given work the governor made
no comment but his arm closed more pro-
tectingly around cropsey
   as usual white did his work thoroughly
everything was in readiness to receive and
succor the stricken man
  the governor waited until the surgeon
had made his report pacing noiselessly up
and down the long corridor of the mens
private ward his head bent as if in thought
and if the white-capped nurses who flitted
quietly in and out of the rooms were sur-
prised to see the highest representative of
the united states in all the east awaiting
news of one of her lowliest citizens they
gave no hint of it in their manner
for days cropsey lingered in that
borderland which separates death
from life and at first it seemed im-
possible that he should not pass across it
but as is so often the case with those to
whom life has the least value he clung
tenaciously to it in the second week it be-
came evident that he would get well al-
though he would have a long period of con-
valescence in the hospital
   it was during this period that the gov-
ernor dropped in to see him occasionally
making little friendly calls as a man does
on his equal
   and during this period a change seemed
to come over cropsey it was as if the fire
passing through his system had burned out
the resentment which hitherto he had felt
toward life and with this change he real-
ized the enormity of his offense
   before he had thought of the governor-
general with a vague feeling of contempt
as a man whom good luck had put into a
position which he cropsey could have
filled much more ably had the same good
luck put him in it now he realized that it
was the governors strength and character
which had raised him above his fellows and
the knowledge humbled him he felt his
own unworthiness
   he spoke of it one afternoon haltinglv
as he sat in a wheel-chair on the balcony
outside his room overlooking the green ter-
races studded with flowering shrubs which
surrounded the hospital trying inadequate-
ly to find words to express his humiliation
  the governor listened without interrup-
tion until cropsey had finished then
placing his hand on the patients knee he
said
  well whatever mistakes you made you
atoned for later suppose we call it quits
all around
  and on his wray out later he stopped at
the chief surgeons office
  will cropsey ever be good for anything
again he asked
   he will get over the effects of the fire all
right governor answered the surgeon
the trouble with him is he has shot his
constitution to pieces like so many of these
fellows over here i am treating him now
for chronic maiaria that is what he will
have to watch out for the fever but with
light work and good food in a place where
he doesnt have to tax his strength too
much he ought to last a long time
  the next morning calvin was instructed
to keep his eyes open for such a billet as
the surgeon had described
  cropsey was able with the aid of a cane
to w-alk about the hospital when calvin re-
ported that he had found a place for him-
keeper of the lighthouse at bago reef
   of course it is a place of great responsi-
bility sir for all the ships from hongkong
and the north depend on that light said
the secretary but he would have a na-
tive assistant to do the heavy work he
would only have to see that the light was
kept burning do you think you could
trust him
  the governor hesitated for a moment
and then said as if thinking aloud
  yes i believe we can at any rate i
am going to chance it a quizzical smile
flashed over his face and he added do
you know i have an idea white wont be
much pleased	
  i have the same idea sir calvin
laughed i think you will have to settle
it with him yourself
  it is a very important place governor
said white quietly when the governor men-
tioned the matter to him
  yes i know but i believe he will meas-
ure up to it he has received his baptism
of fire remember
  white lifted his level eyes to the govern-
ors
  of course if you say put him on i shall
adventure
do it liut you will make me break one rule
 have always observed-never to hire a
man with a slouch in him
  the governor drew meditatively at his
cigar
  slouch or no slouch the man did some-
tlung i confess i should not have had the
courage to do-run for that dynamite in-
stead of away from it
  but if he hadnt put it there in the first
place he wouldnt have had to get it out
it took sand ill admit but it was a sort of
impulse a flash in the pan if it came to
an emergency like sticking to his post if
anything happened to the light-of course
i may be doing him an injustice -but hon-
estly i dont believe he would do it i dis-
trust these fellows who think they know it
ail and wont live up to the rules
the governor rose and held out his hand
  you put him on ill take the responsi-
bility
  it was a part of whites code once he
had employed cropsey to treat him with
absolute fairness he might harbor a
grudge against him personally but he
judged his work as impartially as if the ex-
soldier had been his own selection
  and for a time the new keepers unfa-
miliarity with the routine of his office tried
whites patience but he did not show it
in the long carefully worded letters he
wrote cropsey minutely explaining the er-
rors in his reports and asking for their cor-
rection
  cropsey on his sand spit received these
letters several at a time when the weekly
mail-boat put in at bago and a barefooted
boatman in cotton drawers and a wide
straw hat paddled out to the lighthouse
with the mail he spent hours poring over
them try ing to fix each detail in his mind
but secretly they amused him all this list-
ing of tomatoes and bacon consumed of
gallons of oil burned of the hours he spent
at his work seemed so unnecessary
  the thing was so simple merely to keep
the light burning from evening until morn-
ing at all hazards no matter what hap-
pened so that the steamers whose smoke
from time to time curled upward for half
an hour against the distant horizon might
shun the reef athwart on which for all the
peacefulness of the blue water lay destruc-
tion for any which might chance upon it
and cropsey was contented he had
found his nichc just to sit at the d<x>r of his
bungalow sweeping the sea with his glasses
for passing ships and feeling that he was
master ol the squat tower on his left and
so responsible for their safety gave him a
sense of iinjortance and of usefulness in
the world he came to know the regular
boats and to speak of them to fabian his
assistant affectionately almost as il they
had been persons but he did not envy those
upon them their journeyings he had
found that the jostling of the crowd meant
the multiplication of lifes problems
  there were no white people in bago the
village eight miles away at the head of the
bay sometimes the villagers came over
to the lighthouse and in solemn procession
climbed the winding stair to the light where
they stood silent while cropsey proudly ex-
plained its mechanism the presidente a
wrinkled little man with an olive face who
wore gaiters with elastic in their sides and
a suit of dingy black clothes always came
with them he seemed to have taken a
great fancy to cropsey and always begged
him to come to bago and accept his hos-
pitality
  cropsey had been two months at the
lighthouse before he paid his fir-t i-it to
the village but after that he went frequent-
ly dining with the presidente and return-
ing to his station before sunset for on this
point his instructions had been explicit-he
must always be at his post when the light
was burning
  it was this rule which led him to refuse
the invitation of the presidente to attend
the supper and bailc in honor of the presi-
dentes ninth child the little man took
the refusal to heart
  is it because i am a filipino that you
dont come senor he asked
  no it is the light senor presidente i
must be here when it is burning
  but from my house from the bay you
can always see the light and fabian will
be here to watch it
  anil when cropsey still declined the na-
tives shoulders drooped
  i had hoped you would be padrino he
said slowly
  i will be padrino even though i do not
come answered cropsey
  but the mans disappointment troubled
him as he returned to his house he felt
that the native would never understand
why he declined to come it would seem to
him almost a betrayal of his friendship as
an occasional hero

the presidente had said he would always
be in sight of the lighthouse nothing could
happen in his absence it was not as if it
were the typhoon season when his return
might be cut off by a storm
  the next morning he decided he would
go it would be the only time he would
make the presidente understand that
  as he got into his boat that evening he
felt vaguely depressed he regretted his
decision he glanced upward over his
shoulder at the light which with the pre-
cise movements of a clock was flashing its
warning through the gathering darkness
and impulsively he crossed to the tower and
hastily climbed the stairs everything was
in order it looked as he had seen it look a
thousand times before
  with a shamefaced laugh at his nervous-
ness he returned to his boat and set off for
bago
  but he did not stay long at the christen-
ing his uneasiness came back he was im-
patient to be again with the light which as
he walked down to the water lie saw flash-
ing across the bay
      the full moon which had risen en-
jgsg abled cropsey to see his sand spit
long before he reached it and sud-
denly as he raised his eyes to glance again
at the lighthouse he paused his dripping
paddle held suspended in the air in the
protected waters back of the reef a small
steamer rode at anchor for a time he
could not place the ship none stopped at
that anchorage except-then it came to
him the steamer was the lighthouse ten-
der buluan on which inspector morissey
traveled he had come while the keeper
was absent from his post
  feverishly he returned to his paddling
ms gasps of effort drowning the gurgle of
the water as it fell away from the prow of
his boat one hope sustained him per-
haps the inspector had not gone ashore that
night it was long past midnight the
steamer might have just arrived
  but as he neared his sand spit he saw a
launch drawn up on the shore
  he finished his journey slowly this
then was the end he would lose his place
branded as untrustworthy and with this
     a u burned-ut body he would
not find another no he would drop into
that crowd of derelicts for whom even the
problem of making a jiving had proved in-
soluble shuffling through what remained
to him of life an outcast and a pariah and
the governor would learn that he had be-
trayed his trust he only hoped that he
would never again be called on to meet
those friendly gray eyes
  he looked down at the water a slight
shifting of position a moments struggle
and then oblivion the ripples where the
water broke over his hand on the paddle
were soft and its warmth pleasant to the
skin it would close over him caress-
ingly
  but something stirred in cropsey some
feeling some instinct which had caused
him that other time to run for the dynamite
with a dogged sweep of his paddle he drove
his batica ashore beside the launch
  morissey was reading beside a small
wicker table over which an unshaded lamp
threw a glaring light he glanced up as
cropsey entered but although he had never
seen the keeper before he neither rose nor
introduced himself
  i hope you had a pleasant evening he
said drawing the corners of his straight lips
down into a mocking smile
  cropseys heart sank he read no mercy
in the hard face before him
  fyoure inspector morissey i suppose 
he replied shuffling across the room to a
chair on the other side of the table
  yes i hope my visit hasnt inconve-
nienced you
  my absence doesnt seem to have incon-
venienced you much flared back the keep-
er stung by the others insolence
  your absence returned morissey im-
perturbably i was coming to that i sup-
pose you can explain it
  cropseys anger cooled as quickly as it
had risen
  there aint no excuse if you mean busy-
ness took me i just went over for a min-
ute to a christening at the presidentes i
was padrino to his baby he seemed to think
it was unfriendly when i said i wouldnt go
everything was all right its a fine night
and i could see the light even minute i
was away
  weil said morissey rising and stretch-
ing himself with a yawn youll have a
chance to put it in writing in the morning
and ill give it to the chief maybe he can
see the connection between baptizing a baby
and running a lighthouse i confess i
cant
adventure
  he moved over to the doorway but on
its threshold be paused
  you might send a letter along to the
governor-general at the same time  un-
derstand he is a iriend of yours there
was open mockery in his tone
  cropsey sprang to his feet and rushed to-
ward the inspector his eyes blazing
  you leave the governor out of this do
you hear i aint asking favors  guess i
can take my medicine-you just leave him
out
  morissey stepped backward before this
unexpected outburst for a moment he
stared at cropsey incredulously
  do you mean you are not going to put
up a whine to the governor he asked in
a changed tone
  yes whats he got to do with it
  without replying morissey paced two or
three times up and down the room his
hands clasped behind him his head bent
in thought now and then he shot a curi-
ous look at cropsey who was leaning against
the door-jamb his glance resting on the
floor at length he approached the keeper
  xook here he said i shall have to re-
port your absence but i wili tell white it
was the first time-i talked with fabian
before you came-and everything seems to
be in capital shape i will mention that too
you write out whatever you want to say
make it as strong as you can hie hesi-
tated as he saw the look in cropseys eyes
dont count too much on it white is
strong for keeping on the job maybehe
will let you off this time but frankly i
doubt it good night
  cropsey limply shook the outstretched
hand and without comment dragged his
tired body to the lighthouse the staccato
explosions of the engine in morisseys
launch sounded like pistol-shots in his brain
as he sank wearily on the steps
two weeks later morissey finished
his cruise and reported to white in
manila
  thats a queer specimen you have down
there he said as white looked up from the
papers in cropseys case he ought to
have whined but he didnt and when i
taunted him with his pull with the gov-
ernor he nearly murdered me if you fire
him honestly i dont believe he will put up
a howl
  white laid the papers carefully on the
table and swung his chair around so that
through the open window his glance rested
on the blue waters of the ba and the dis-
tant slope of mariveles rising behind them
morisseys report had caused him a dis-
tinct feeling of regret
  in the months that cropsey had been at
bago whites feeling toward him had
changed it had gradually been borne in
upon him that the keeper was taking pride
in his work and was honestly trying to carry
out his duties and if a man is sincere in his
work the work is apt to take care of itself
the irregularities in his reports had grown
less and less frequent white had come to
feel that bago was no longer one of his prob-
lems to dismiss cropsey would be- to open
it again
  but the invariable punishment for ab-
sence from duty was dismissal he told
himself he would have to let the keeper go
but he also told himself there was no hurry
-the matter could rest until tomorrow
he turned briskly and rose from his
chair
  come on he said lets go up to the
club and have a bile of lunch there are-
one or two points i want to clear up before
i take action-
   i dont think he would do it again said
the inspector stretching himself lazily
  oh i suppose we will have to let him
out white answered indifferently as they
started for the door
  morissey smiled but made no comment
  the papers were still hang on whites
desk when the inspector entered the next
morning
  do you know said the chief  have
been trying to find a man for that bago
place and to save my soul i cant think of
one i would be willing to trust with it
confound that fellow he has put us in a
hole
  why not let cropsey stay on for a
time ventured morissey turning to the
window to conceal his grin
  white tapped the edge of his desk with a
pencil
  but that- the strident noise of his
telephone-bell interrupted him yes this
is white
  morissey watching the face of his chief
knew from its growing tenseness that he was
receiving news of importance he caught
the words bago-cropsey-cholera you
say yes ill go at once thank you
an occasional hero

   white snapped the receiver on its hook
and sprang to his feet
   can the buluan put to sea in an hour
bob he asked
   yes something the matter with crop-
sey
   i dont know that was the executive
secretary he had a wire from the presi-
dente at bago said they have had cholera
at the lighthouse and cropsey needs help
the message wasnt very dear ill get a
doctor and meet you on board at noon
   the one thing which unfailingly strikes
terror to the heart of the white man in the
philippines is asiatic cholera its loath-
someness the suddenness with which it
strikes its victims the flame-like rapidity
with which it spreads give it an air of mys-
teriousness which adds to its horror what
he eats the very air he breathes seem
charged with a subtle menace
      when cropsey ten days after
morisseys departure entered the
nipa house on the other side of the
tower in which fabian lived with his wife
and two children he had expected to find
one of them ailing of a mild complaint fa-
bian had said merely that the nino was sick
when he requested cropsey to come
   but a glance at the gasping child and
cropsey had recognized the malady of
which he had seen strong men die over-
night it had cholera
   the mother round-eyed and passive
squatted on the floor behind the low bed
behind her beside a half-emptied rice-pot
stood the other child its little stomach pro-
truding like an inflated balloon from its
short white shirt it had eaten from the
same vessel as its brother fabian enter-
ing after cropsey had paused near the door
   the eyes of all were fixed on the white
man in their trouble they had instinctively
turned to him for assistance
   cropsey gave some hurried instructions
to the woman-in his heart he realized their
inadequacy-and then turning away he
beckoned to fabian who followed him
across the sand spit to his bungalow here
cropsey wrote a hurried letter to white
telling him of the cholera and suggesting
that he send a man to bago to take charge
of the light in case his services should be
needed
hc sid t fabian you take
this lo bago and post it then you come
back with gonzales the mcdico quick
but be sure to post the letter-theres a
boat tomorrow and ask the presidente to
come back with you he can send a man to
taypay with a telegram
  the resentfulness which since morisseys
visit cropseys face had worn was gone
in the depths of his eyes one might have
seen a vague look of terror but his step as
he again entered fabians house was reso-
lute
  fabian reached bago as night was falling
-in the bottom of the banca which a fish-
ing-boat had picked up as it drifted aim-
lessly about the bay and cropseys letter
was in the pocket of his camisa when they
buried him the next morning without wait-
ing for the presidente to return from a few
days visit to taypay
  at about the same hour cropsey and the
woman were spading two narrow graves in
the sand back of the lighthouse
  through his glasses later he watched the
mail-boat depart for manila in a week
he told himself she would return with a
man to relieve him and he could get away
he would not wait for his dismissal he
was weary he stretched his hand against
a post to support himself as a slight dizzi-
ness shook him
  he was alone when the mail-boat re-
turned he had difficulty in making out
her lines his sight was becoming blurred
he had to blink before he looked at objects
three days and nights he had watched be-
side the woman stealing away only to at-
tend the light and to snatch such food as
he could find fit to eat without cooking
and then-of her house he had made her
funeral pyre
  with the woman gone his duties had
become less exacting but he found them
more difficult to perform the walk be-
tween his bungalow and the tower became
a journey which at last he ceased to make
living in the lighthouse and saving his
strength for the torturing climb of the
stairs
  he had long since ceased to wonder why
fabian had not come back with the presi-
dente only one idea filled his mind-to
keep the light burning until the white ship
coming from the south turned in at bago
bay
  now that white ship was here he
watched her cut her way leisurely through
the blue-gray waters to the distant village

adventure
and then for hours he waited for the bout
which would bring liis relief
  when ut lust he realized that none was
coming he gave a mirthless laugh and sank
down in the doorway of the tower his head
resting on its sill they expected him to
do the job alone they refused to help him
  here the presidente found him he
could make little of cropseys mutterings
he shook his head when he saw the burned
house there was an air of desolation about
the place
  he took the keeper by the arm
  come with me sefior he said
  but cropsey shook him olt with feeble
curses raving incoherently something about
being no quitter
  when the butuan under forced draft
rounded the point to the south the sun was
shining brightly and white and morissey
standing on the bridge eagerly focussed
their glasses on the lighthouse
presently an exclamation broke from
morissey
 my god the lights flashing
 the presidente met them on the beach
 the door is locked sefior he said and
 all day yesterday the light burned
 white forced the door and ran hurriedly
 up the stairs but something by the light
 drove him back
 as he passed to the fresh air outside he
 met the doctor
 i dont think you will be needed he
 said
 two hundred yards out across the rip-
 pling water the ibutuan rode at anchor
 from her stem snapping in the brisk
 breeze flew the flag of his country
 for a full minute white gazed at it fixed-
 ly then turning he raised his glance to
 the light and suddenly lifting his hat he
 placed it against his breast and bowed his
 head reverently
hapyd rock
juliuj
grinnell
furtfimann
t was at sixtv-mile on the
edge of the mojave where the
mountains met the desert where
grant brothers  mccann were
pushing a hard-rock grade toward reno for
the california  nevada southwestern
where the sun was dropping down behind
h
the hills and the light it cast becoming
softened and romantic where of a sudden
the great peaks shook
boom
 there was no wind only this low sullen
 roar came back over the hills
boom-mt
hard rock

  they were firing the evening round out
on the grade down in the tunnels dyna-
mite was finishing the days work shot
succeeded shot the mountains flung back
the echoes the earth seemed to reel under
the measured crash on crash it was as if
several batteries of big guns had suddenly
gone into action
  in the deathly quiet that fell with the
last of it two men slowly mounted the rocky
path that chipped its way up the steep wall
of the canon leading into the far side of
camp they were an oddly assorted pair
one was a squat burly little man in cordu-
roys with a chest like a gorilla extraordi-
narily long arms and a pug nose the other
was rather tall of lank bulk every way a
young giant with short red hair eyes packed
away under heavy brows and a great clean-
shaven jaw that always looked cheerfully
grim
  a stiff climb brought them to the path
which swinging around a bend led to the
little yellow commissary shack and beyond
that to the long low-built wtooden structure
hereafter known as the cook-house
  ha said the little man stopping
short
  the other swung his head
  whats the matter
  look whos come to camp
  a chuck-wagon had just pulled up in
front of the commissar the speaker indi-
cated a big young man taking his ease on
the seat the driver had jumped down and
disappeared in the litde company store
  the red-headed young man laughed a
hard soundless laugh through closed lips
   gunner gallegher he said in a low
voice
  at this moment the other looked up and
saw them he did not move but just sat
there looking down at them his dark face
lighting up with the grim inquisitive ex-
pression that is so near smiling and vet so
different in effect
  they walked over
  hello gunner said the red-headed
young man
  gallegher nodded
  hi bonfire said he then jerked his
head toward the others companion whos
your friend
  burns tom burns you remember
him from the north bank dont you
  oh yes he had the timber ganc thats
right hi burns
  hello gallegher the little timberman
nodded back hows everything
  pretty good made a short stake in the
d	 r g tunnels out of grand junction
hows tricks bonfire added gallegher
turning to the other
  fair enough said bonfire im day
shifter over in south thirty-five
whats the pay
  four dollars and cakes
  to the initiate the foregoing meant that
bonfire was day foreman in the tunnel
knowm as south thirty-five and that his
wages were four dollars a day and board
  humph thats not so bad observed
gallegher half to himself
  oh i dont know but jobs are scarce
in this mans camp muttered bonfire i
tell you gunner they aint hiring a soul
these days new orders or something from
los
  thats what they told me down at the
siding gallegher nodded but id heard
that youd come up this way bonfire so i
jacked up and came on
  well i been looking for you said bon-
fire i been looking for you to show up lor
the last two weeks i have for a fact gun-
ner got kind of restless too like so any
time youre ready now theres a nice piece
of ground up there back of the bunkhouse
howr dyou feel
  for reply gallegher jumped down from
the wagon-seat he stood there stretching
his long arms and showing the depth and
breadth of his big chest
  i feel fine said he why
  i was just wondering thought you
might be a little tired with your ride or
something two days on that desert road
aint no fun i know what it is myself
nodded bonfire we could wait till to-
morrow you know	
gallegher shook his head
  not for me how about yourself he
added a little anxiously
  oh im all right put in a pretty big
day underground but i guess im good for
a half hour of your fastest
  it wont take that long said gunner
gallegher
  the other gave him a bleak stare
  what dyou mean he muttered ad-
vancing a step
  gallegher faced him with a grin
nothing said he and let his long arms
swing free
adventure
  at this juncture the little timberman
burns stepped up breaking a long rather
diffident silence
  say i dont want to be offensive he
began but whats the row
  gallegher turned his head
  nothing much he said quietly me
and hims got some unfinished business
thats all i thought youd heard about it
burns why less than three months ago
bonfire blew into shoshone gap and took
me to the worst licking i ever had in my
life-
  the little timberman nodded
  i remember now he said grinning
you had a job and he fought you for it
some of the boys were talking about it the
other night it aint the first time either
is it
 what
  that you two have pulled this stunt
not by half been at it nearly two
years now off and on but we aint the
only ones that do it i know lots of lads
who wont go to work any other way its
an old game among short-stake men and a
good game too when two lads are feeling
their silk and jobs are few and far between
its been turn-and-turn-about with bonfire
and me so far the last time he beat me
and beat me good beat me out of bunk and
bindle and job thats the hard-rock game
winner take all eh bonfire
  the latter was unbuttoning his corduroy
jacket
  something like that he answered
pulling it off
  the little timberman bums chuckled and
grinned casting an appraising glance from
one to the other of the two big young men
  well he said in a minute i wouldnt
bet a nickel either way myself
  five minutes later stripped to the waist
gunner gallegher and bonfire stood facing
each other in a ring of shouting men plenty
of daylight lingered the purple mountain
leaned against the vermillion sky and in
the blue an immense height above lolled
an eagle lazy of wing in lordly indolence
the crowd stood twenty deep a typical
hard-rock crew-tall barbaric-looking men
in khaki and corduroy careless of speech
and gay at heart
  now gunner
  go in bonfire
  i saw the shoshone scrap
  they fought two hours
      the two men were well matched
one was as tall as the other and as
broad and it would have been hard
to say if there was any advantage in weight
just where it fell the two men sparred
warily moving after each other with the
quiet ease of two huge cats there is a cer-
tain beauty in strength and then there is a
certain ugliness but that usually comes
with age these two men were beautifully
young and strong and their lithe white
nakedness gleamed in the twilight
  time roared the men
  no hurry muttered bonfire and
snapped in a light lead it was a flashing
dart of wrist and mitt and the gunners
lip streamed red as he recovered with a rush
and a shower of sledge-hammer blows
  first blood set the crowd to yelling
  bonfire ducked gamely he had all he
could do to save his head there was no
evading that avalanche of big-bodied bone
and muscle he stood his ground and took
and gave smash for smash though the play
was not up to his fancy for the gunn- rs
long game was to give and take bonfires
to hit and get away but there was no help
for it now he caught gallegher in lull
dash and playing for the body drove home
his left and right with a force that jerked
forth a grunt with each blow
  gallegher halted grinning for more and
bonfire stepped into a full swing that gave
him a taste of his own salt blood he sab-
red and the rue for another savage swing
beat down his guard and as he dived in for
a hanging clinch to save himself his jaw
came full on the peak of a sidelong uppercut
which started at the gunners right hip
the big fist traveling less than six inches the
shoulder nine
  it was a terrific bunt bonfire found him-
self on his knees watching a gay fanfare of
lightning crazily filming his brain blood
trickled from liis nose and ears he saw the
gunner dragging himself on all fours out
of the hurly-burly of the yelling mob for
the body-english of the blow had carried
him headlong over his man then reeling
to their feet the two men went at it again
  back and forth they footed it struggling
for holds twice bonfire tore loose and
staggering the gunner with a straight right
and left he clinched again to and fro
they clipped once more with the crowd roar-
ing for a break but the two men paid no
heed and in the wrestling gallegher began
hard rock

to show who was the stronger man again
and again he beat bonfire to his knees using
ihe sheer weight of body and fist it was
terrible punishment yet there must have
been something of the antaeus in the man
for with each fall bonfire seemed to gain
fresh wind and new heart for the fray
  he began to come back to something like
his old snap-shot form he began to fight
with his head and feet as well as his hands
up to now he had given way and been
clubbed down the gunner still rushed
him fiercely wildly but now bonfire moved
like a wind-driven shadow hitting hard and
fast at ever turn he gave his adversary
respect withal cutting and slashing at long
range until the rushes began to fall short
grow more unsteady more wild which must
be expected if you dont get your man and
then taking his time bonfire began to cut
the gunner to pieces
  thus the tide turned and at last galle-
gher halted blinded gasping he spat and
a tooth lay on the ground he stood still
glowering like a stricken bull his breath
came in great sobs blow by blow he was
being worn down to the quick then on the
verge of his stubborn relapse surprisingly
as if drawing on the last ounce of his reserve
energy the gunner made a snarling rush
slugging out with both fists
  bonfire side-stepped neatly parading
some pretty foot-work he ducked under a
full right-swing and driving left and right
to the ribs got away gallegher reeled
under the savage impact but turned and
came back gamely he rocked a little as he
stood opposite his man and his arms
drooped as if he felt his fists to be an unut-
terable weight his face showed terrible
punishment every breath he drew seemed
a great actuality the man was smashed
all in at last
  finish him bellowed the crowd
  it was the beginning of the end and the
mob was not to be denied bonfire smiled
his eyes were quiet even pensive but his
face was terrible livid with the strange
almost unearthly russet pallor that follows
the stormy pageant of red-headed men like
a curse of god a sudden hush fell on the
crowd which had drawn back a little so
the two men in the middle might have
plenty room to make an end
  bonfire took his time the gunner
looked all in and all that but bonfire knew
his man he had beaten him before he
had him beaten now but bonfire was not
going to take any chances hard rock is
hard rock you may pierce it with sharp
steel and break it with dynamite but you
cant kill it it is smashed at the same
time it lives ready to strike back there
are men like that they work in hard rock
 bonfire made no mistake he crept
around the motionless figure in the middle
of the ring he stalked it deliberately coolly
confidently like a big cat waiting for the
moment to spring one punch just one
that was all he wanted
  suddenly he sprang in whatever was
passing in the gunners mind at this mo-
ment is not knowm but he seemed barely
able to raise his hands to meet the others
rush he attempted a right swing which
bonfire dropped his guard to sweep aside
  then something happened which can not
be explained for with his foeman once
more within easy reach weariness seemed
to fall from galleghers shoulders like a
blanket he grinned with awful expression
and the rest was sharp work grim and
swift and terrible his right swing was only
a feint now he sank it like a flash and as he
followed through with a quick curious
shifting of his feet his left fist shot in over
bonfires lowered guard it struck di-
rectly over the heart-a two hundred and
ten pound jolt-and bonfire straightened
up slowly then fell forward like a stricken
tree face dowrn in the soft white dust
  it wras the end gallegher knew it so
did the crowd by its silence it was a full
minute perhaps before the prostrate figure
stirred then surprisingly the man rolled
over on his back and sat up raising himself
slowly upon his outspread arms he looked
around stupidly
  gallegher broke the silence
  had enough he asked standing over
his man bonfire looked up wetting hi
lips
  no he said in a minute no i aint
done yet and he tried to get up on his
feet
  he fell back on one knee and then sud-
denly made it after a fashion rocking and
swaying in front of the gunner like a
drunken man
  good boy said somebody in the crowd
  bonfire staggered out and around the
gunner he tried to lift his hands but
could not
  come on he said thickly

adventure
   gallegher hesitated no longer he ad-
 vanced a step his list rising at his side
 another blow would finish it but the gun-
 ner paused in full stride his arm poising in
 mid-swing
 wait a minute
 a burly figure barred his way
 it all happened in the tick of the
 clock the newcomer held up his hand he
 was a powerful wide-girthed fellow with a
 heavy brutal face and a scowling brow
 which as his grin faded matched a hard-
 set mouth a respectful commotion rose
 at his back
   whats the matter with you boys he
 growled
   bonfire reeled weakly at his elbow
   get out of my way roared the gunner
   the other laughed in his face pie spoke
 with authority
  wait a minute there what dyou
 want to do-kill the man
   gallegher breathed in once hard
   i would he said and once more bon-
 fire staggered out
   come on gunner he begged i aint
 done yet-
   the newcomer shouldered him off
   there wont be any more scrapping to-
 night he said as if that settled it
   a low murmur bespoke the displeasure of
 the crowd
   as for the gunner he drew a whistling
 breath and batted an eye at bonfire and a
 strange thing happened both men turned
 and made for the other man their arms
 swinging loose murderously like those in a
 common cause the other stood his ground
 he laughed and at the sound bonfire
 stopped and shook himself dazedly
   wait a second he said catching the
 gunners arm its jeff call the walker
   youre a fine rock foreman sneered
 the walking-boss youre a fine guy you
 are whos going to hole south thirty-
 five if you get put out
   the question had at once the physical
 effect of oil and a barb there was a low
 murmur of assent from the crowd bonfire
 winced
   what arc you butting in for
 the walking-boss met the parry with a
 curse
   what am i butting in for well you
 can bet all your old shoes it wasnt because
 i was worrying about your hide ill tell
you why-i aint taking any chances if
south thirty-five is holed tomorrow ii
means a two thousand dollar bonus for the
camp ain t that what we been working
for day and night for the last month
  the crowd was impressed
  thats so muttered a few
  the walking-boss saw his advantage and
pursued it
  listen boys see if i aint right
south thirty-five is in three thousand and
four feet the engineers told me this morn-
ing that the work in north thirty-five-
on the other side of the hill-was only
twenty-six foot away our grade and
theirs is the like and ive stopped their
side of the work too dangerous the day-
shot broke an even nine foot in the tunnel
 figure on the night shift doing the same
so with a little luck bonfire ought to hole
her out tomorrow and grab the bonus
  bonfire smiled a wan smile
  oh ill hole her all right he said
proudly
  instantly the walking-boss clinched his
argument
  then whats the use of taking any
chances bonfire knows the old girl like
a book if he gets licked today the gunner
gets his job he may be a good man-i
know he is-but weve got to think about
our bonus if they want to fight it out
again let them wait till the shift comes off
tomorrow afternoon its all the same lo
me then what im thinking about is the
bonus the camp wants the money and
the record the gunner can take a ma-
chine under bonfire if he likes and share
with the rest wtiat dyou say
  the crowd was with him to a man
  fair enough said bonfire
  the gunner gave a short- nod
  but say jeff call he addressed the
walking-boss since youre such a good
hand at fixing things maybe youd like to
try a little of the same
  what dyou mean
  you know what i mean-when bonfire
and i get through winner take all said
the gunner looking sly bunk and bindle
and job
  some of the men laughed the walking-
boss gave a surprised curse then scowled
thoughtfully
  i dont know gunner ill have to see
you and bonfire better go and have a wash
before supper i like your nerve i may give
hard rock

you a chance if you put bonfire away i
aint had a good scrap since that set-to with
red cobleigh up on the north bank-
nearly two years ago ill see gunner ill
see about it
  no hurry jeff said the gunner look-
ing at his knuckles
  bonfire touched his arm
  come on gunner he said lets go
and wash up
  late that night the shift struck springs
in the heading so when bonfire and the day
shift came on the next morning the delayed
shot was just being pulled the denota-
tions cracked forth from the portal of the
tunnel with a certain deliberation as from
the mouth of a big gun
  the men of the night shift looked hag-
gard and wan from their long vigil at the
machines
gffljs bonfire saw that the air-pumps
ihmj were set to wrork then entered the
tunnel the gunner followed him
without a word each carried a flaring stub
of candle halfway in creeping foot-high
along the narrow muck-car track an acrid
yellow smoke met them the ghost of the
blast they pressed on coughing as this
sub-floor of gas and smoke grew thick wall-
like reducing the yellow flame of the can-
dles to mere spots in the murk
  in the heading however they found the
air clean and sweet made so by the suck
and drive of the two great tin air-pipes
which hung against the left wall of the long
drift it sounded like a giant coughing and
gagging
  a huge pile of broken stone the product
of the shot confronted them and back of it
gleaming sheer blank rose the clean white
breast of living rock the two rockmen
crouched on the towering pile inspecting
the grim work of steel giant powder and
flame
  fine white muck said bonfire sifting
some clean and dry as a wisp no more
water glory be
  l hen the men came in bonfire told
them that a scant nine feet of white lime-
stone lay between them and the big bonus
he drove the shovelers at the great pile of
broken rock they caught something of his
own virile impatience by and by hauled
by the little electric motor-engine car after
car of muck shot out to the dump even
the gunner condescended to put a hand to
a shovel and speedily cleared a place against
the breast of rock to set his big air-drill
  then a muck-car loaded with sharp steel
drills rolled into the heading the nipper
boy stood them in the rack and presently
the narrow drift was filled with the brazen
song and scream of steel biting into hard
rock
  candles stuck in broken ledges of the
passage threw an unearthly yellow glare
over all
  the drills were changed every three min-
utes within two hours the muck pile was
a slender heap bonfire stood at the naked
backs of his men contentedly drinking in
the din the gunner worked like a demon
he arrayed himself with steel and air which
screamed and hissed and sang against the
ugly face of the stubborn rock bonfire
patted his streaming shoulder approvingly
the gunner was setting a terrific pace for
the rest of the men
  dont wear yourself out gunner ad-
vised bonfire with a grin remember
youve got a little unfinished business for
this afternoon
  im remembering returned the gun-
ner grimly he grinned but there was a
keen half-cruel look about the tight lips
and impatient eyes
  at three oclock the roimd was set down
and load d it consisted of fourteen holes
loaded with about three or four hundred
pounds of dynamite each hole was capped
with a primer and a fuse ten of the holes
were three inches in diameter and eight
feet deep in the rock the four remaining
holes were four inches in diameter and sis
feet deep
  these last four were bored diagonally into
the rock about two feet above the ground
they required almost as heavy a load as
the rest of the holes combined they were
called the lifters the fuses of these loads
were cut and timed so as to fire last tha
each great shot might have a separate op-
portunity to heave up through its quarter
of the rock rending and tearing all
  it is the lifter that smashes hard rock into
small fine bits so on occasion would it
smash a man
  the men stood back a little as bonfire
and the gunner made ready to fire the
round black lengths of fuse dangled over
the white face of the rock like the tenacles
of a huge devil-fish the four top-holes
were fired first they ranged across the top

adventure
of the breast about two feet from the roof
the lirst fuse which was cut at nine feet
spat a wicked stream of lire over the gun-
ners candle
  instantly a curious commotion appeared
among the men they began a hoarse cry-
fire in the heading
  it passed quickly from mouth to mouth
and echoed out and through the far glim-
mering portal
  each foot of fuse represented sixty sec-
onds of time when bonfire and the gun-
ner set fire to the six breast-holes which lay
across the middle of the rock the first fuse
in the top-hole measured less than six feet
and spat tire and hissed like an angry snake
the lifters were fired last then candle in
hand bonfire drove his men toward the
motor-engine waiting in the heading to
carry- them all to safety gallegher walked
at his side
  the men clumsily piled into the depths of
three empty muck-cars coupled to the
motor-engine while bonfire and the gun-
ner climbed up on opposite sides of a fourth
car which was nearly full of broken rock
bound for the dump
  all aboard said bonfire and the little
train started with a jerk
  and as they got under way the gunner
leaned over his side of the car and said-
  well bonfire if-
  he never finished the sentence for
even as he spoke the loaded muck-car
reeled under them and gave a sudden lurch
bonfire sprang backwards to see the car
heel and crash into the ditch on the gun-
ners side
      the gunner himself disappeared
       the motor-engine leapt ahead car-
 rying three cars and a snapped
coupling it stopped within five lengths
and some of the men came running back
the muck-car lay on its side in the ditch
and the gunner who had been pinned under
it in some way cried out suffocatedly
another cry answered him
  fire in the heading
and a small band of mexican shovelers
piled out of the cars and ran helter-skelter
for the portal bonfire stood gazing dow-n
at the wrecked car his men behind him
howr are you fixed gunnerl he shouted
the buried mans voice came back
  fine lad kind of short of breath ac-
count of this load of muck on my chest
but outside of that i guess im all together
you lads better go while you can-
  for answer bonfire sprang into the ditch
and tugged at the high side of the over-
turned muck-car with a futile frantic grip
his torso muscles leashed and creaked un-
der the unequal strain his men went at
it too on all sides of the car but to no good
it was too much for them and presently
they all stood back gasping
  fire in the heading
  the cry rang back from the narrow walls
a few of the men glanced at the blazing
fuses in the heading and ran the motor-
man asked bonfire for orders
  no hurry said bonfire coolly at
that i guess we aint got time to unload this
muck car
  the slender band of men who remained
cast furtive looks in the direction of the
sparking and hissing rock a few whim-
pered for bonfire to come on but he
shook them off
  go on with you urged the buried man
there aint no use of you fellows sticking
around im just as good as dead go on
bonfire or the first thing you know shell
be licking all of you out along with me-
dyou hear bonfire-bonfire lad-you
havent gone yet
  no said bonfire
  the men had shrunk back a little and left
him standing there nothing seemed to
move the man
  no hurry he muttered glancing at a
piece of iron rod he held in his right hand
it was about two feet long and spoon-
shaped at one end a miners spoon an im-
plement used by rockmen for removing
fuse and primer from a hole when a misfire
or something is the matter
  come on bonfire begged the men
it wont do any good to stand here you
heard what the gunner said look at the
burning drift
  bonfire trimmed a stub of candle with his
knife
  fire in the heading shrilled the re-
lentless cry
  it fell to a piteous screech
  go on then bonfire roared of a sud-
den and the men fell back before the cold
fire that was in his eyes
  what are you going to do muttered
one
  nothing said bonfire im going to
stay and pull that load
hard rock

  he swung around
  aw say bonfire growled the man
under the muck car
  fire in the heading
  the motor-engine roared out toward the
portal as bonfire turned and ran back into
the sparking breast a deathly quiet fell
in the narrow drift the dark was like
doom it was accentuated rather than dis-
turbed by that ominous hiss and flash
bonfire and the gunner were alone with   
  fire in the heading
  at the portal the men of the day shift
waited in characteristic attitudes many
cursed they named the powder and the
rock horribly others rolled cigarettes
the mexicans shrilled prayers for the dying
until burns the little timberman made
out a few words of the gibberish and began
a fusillade of sharp rock
  aint you a fine bunch of grave diggers
he roared get out of this
  some of the men jumped up and ran
toward camp screaming the news along
road and path
  fire in the heading moaned the siren
on the hill
  he cant make it muttered burns
hes got less than four minutes to pull the
whole load there aint a chance in the
world for him to get down to those bloody
lifters and one of them mind will fire
the whole round
  then suddenly there came a short whip-
like roar close at hand
  one counted the men mechanically
bonfires first act on entering
the drift had been to reach for a
sputtering length of fuse which dan-
gled from the top hole at the left this fuse
had been fired first he pulled lightly a
shower of fine sand and a yellow stick of
giant powder slid into his hand he
gnashed at the spark in the fuse with his
knife it flamed within three feet and a
half from the primer
  three and one-half minutes of life
  bonfire worked swiftly with knife and
hand guttering fuse and primer for light
in that dark and narrow plac he clenched
the four-inch stub of candle between his
strong white teeth when he reached the
four breast-holes the first fuse read like a
ticker
  one minute and thirty seconds
  bonfire began to curse the living rock
and each red eye in that rugged face seemed
to twinkle back with infinite mirth it
winked at him in a huge grin bonfire
whimpered as he stabbed at the terrible
eyes great rivulets of sweat ran down his
cheeks he could feel the hot stream drip-
ping on his breast welling under his arm-
pits
  his curses broke out afresh he personi-
fied everything he had a profane name
for the rock for the powder for the gunner
for the men who waited at the portal the
very rock seemed possessed it clutched
and clung to the imp of death in itsvitals like
a mother to her child when a primer and
a fuse came readily to his hand he cursed it
endearingly and when it evaded him almost
cunningly he bellowed like an angry bull
  mechanically his motions were perfect
there was no faltering no trick of the hand
or eye wasted and no wavering of heart
the man appeared to array himself against
the grim breast of the rock with superb ef-
frontry now he laughed and sang at in-
tervals
  then the first lifter less than a foot of
fuse lay between his knife and the primer
fie chuckled less than sixty seconds to
death he tore at the second lifter-hole
and the fuse brittle and rotten with the
flying spark came away in his scorched and
bleeding hands
  for an awful jiffy of terror he was minded
to tear at the stubborn rock with his bare
mitts he dug furiously in the lifter-hole
reaching for the hidden primer with the
miners spoon he nicked the spark without
a glance there was no time the third
lifter rose easily and bonfire laughed his
knife touched the brass primer on one side
and the spark on the other less than fif-
teen ticks of the clock between him and   
  one hole remained
  he squatted on die floor driving the
spoon warily against the wall of the hole
for the lightest touch would drop that hot
spark into the primer
  bonfire felt the spoon catch hold a cold
sweat broke and welled all over him he
raised the spoon carefully so that its pre-
cious burden might not joggle and then as
he nipped the protruding yellow stick with
its stub of fuse he knew that he held death
spitting in his hands
  he turned and threw it toward the portal
with all his might it hurtled through the
air and fell a good fifty feet beyond where

adventure
the gunner lay under the overturned muck-
  car
    then he crumpled against the side of the
  rock which received him on its huge white
  breast almost gently he wondered at the
  sullen roar and the shock of air which flat-
  tened him out
    and when the men came upon him a lit-
  tle later he was lying face-down in a little
  pile of primers and fuse beside the stingless
  breast of rock he breathed jerkily with
  gentle hands they turned him over on his
  back he seemed to grin at them and the
  grotesque effect was heightened by a
  twisted stub of candle jauntily coked in the
  comer of his mouth like a cherished per-
  fecto
    awfully tired he said suddenly then
  he wandered a little that you gunner
  no hurry ill be ready for you in a minute
  give me a smoke somebody he added
  sitting up
    as they half carried him past the mexi-
  cans shoveling muck from the car which
  still pinned the gunner in the ditch he
  stood free
    hello gunner he called
    that you bonfire
    how dyou feel
    pretty good hows yourself
    oh im all right have you got any-
  thing broke gunner
no i dont think so the buried man
seemed to hesitate say lad he began
   what
    that was a grand piece of work you just
  put over id liked to have done it my-
  self
    oh you would eh
you heard me and say let me tell you
something feuow you wait till they get
this load of muck off my chest then you
look out for yourself the muffled voice
- broke off then dyou hear
    bonfire laughed a hard soundless laugh
  through closed lips
    oh ill wait for you he said
  that was all bonfire laughed again and
started back into the heading to look over
the reloading of the day shot-
hard rock is hard rock
      two days later an empty chuck-
ed wagon returned to sixty-milt sid-
ing a big young man sat on the
seat beside the driver lie dismounted at
they pulled up in front of the little company
offices inside he asked for the division
engineer
  a young man in spectacles came up to
the counter
  what can i do for you
  i want a pass to mojave been working
up at sixty-mile
  without further ceremony the engineer
drew forward a book of blue railroad trans-
portation his fountain-pen paused
name
  the big young man turned his face the
sole attractions of which were a twisted
nose a spreading patch of purple under
each eye some caked mud and blood and a
swollen lip to his questioner
  cobleigb bonfire cobleigh was hii
answer
  the engineer stared at him
  bonfire cobleigh why only the other
day a big fellow was in here asking for you
i sent him up to sixty-mile you must
have met him-
  bonfire nodded grimly
  i met him all right and i wasnt the
only one either it might interest you to
know that youve got a new walking-boss
up there now take a slant at my face its
a quince but it aint a marker to what the
old gunner handed to the walker jeff call
when he got through with me he got my
job and then he got jeffs-but say
bonfire had his pass now he paused in
the door flashing a rare bright look upon
the bewildered young man in spectacles
  if anybody comes in here asking for me
tell him which way i went will you kid

chapter i
i am lucky to find a berth
          t is with some little trepidation
that i start in spinning this yarn
because i have an instinctive
feeling that it will be ridiculed
and curt y dismissed as being what old sail-
ors would call a twister when a man
has been kicked out of a consuls office and
designated as a crazy shellback when he
has been laughed at and called ugly names
when his most solemn oath has been the
subject for incredulous jeers and his charac-
ter as a sober citizen is doubted he naturally
becomes apprehensive in opening up afresh
an affair which he has tried hard to forget
  my position at the present time is such
that my connection with the affair would
not redound to my credit and i have no
desire to lose caste by coming out under my
own name and relating the circumstances
as they actually happened one man be-
lieves me and it is with reluctance that i
concede to his request and give to the world
a secret which has rankled in my mind for
many many years a sensitiveness to the
shafts of ridicule has always been the weak
point in my armor but by employing ficti-
tious names of persons and vessels con-
cerned i shield myself from being made a
target for personal remarks of a derisive and
satirical nature
  somewhere or other i read of a man who
related the story of his life to a party of
iriends he was a jolly sort of fellow and his
story was a heartrending one but on its
conclusion the audience were convulsed in
laughter and refused to believe that his tale
was true i regard myself in the same light
and being an old sailor my narrative like
that of the humorist will probably be taken
with a grain of salt go ahead dear reader
and take it whatever way you like i know
it is real enough to me
  i was bom and brought up in a little
coast town in the pine tree state and like
a good many down-east youngsters i broke
away for sea at an early age after two or
three years hard grinding in the mill of
foremast experience i came out ground
and bolted but my parents having died
while i was learning to hand reef and steer
i was left to work out my own traverse in
life after a bitter time in some hard craft
i gained a masters certificate in liverpool
and when the civil war broke out i shipped
as second mate aboard cotton ships running
the blockade into wilmington and charles-
ton though a northerner in sympathyy
and by birth i with many others was cap-
tured by a federal cruiser and promptly
jugged after two months confinement
i escaped and lived very precariously for a
lengthy period and in november  was
in new york-stranded
  the period of depression after the war
had set in and business was bad in the
united states then everybody was re-
trenching money was scarce and employ-
ment was scarcer the alabama and con-
federate privateers had practically destroyed
the american merchant marine and with

  	adventure
the stagnation in shipping which prevailed
starv ing sailormen loafed around the water-
front sleeping in warehouses and living on
the bounty of more fortunate shellbacks
aboard the vessels every boarding-house
on south and water streets was crammed
with seafarers ready to sign away their liber-
ty for a year without remuneration as long
as they could till a gnawing stomach
  among this crowd of destitutes i was
one of the fortunate ones having been
taken in by dennis sullivan after spending
a week or two living in the street and
boarding in the market sullivan fa-
miliarly known to sailormen as hash
sullivan ran a boarding-house on oliver
street and a worse sailor-robber never
drew breath he was irish and a plug-
ugly for looks and his cognomen came
from the form of diet which was the piece
de resistance at his establishment
when i blew into hash sullivans
my whole worldly possessions con-
sisted of my clothes and a slieath-
knife the clothes for convenience and
decencys sake i carried on my back they
consisted of an old felt bucko hat a
woolen shirt a pair of tar-stained dungaree
pants and a pair of slipshods-sea-boots
with the uppers cut off socks i didnt
have the knife and sheath were sup-
ported around my waist by a strap which
originally formed part of a horses harness
but when sullivan saw it he promptly took
it away from me saying
  young fellow i wouldnt wear that belt
there is nawthin looks so well on a sailor
as a good smart rope-yarn
  so my clothes and knife were afterwards
held together and supported by a piece of
marline and my belt went to fit out some
ether poor devil outward bound
  i lived a good three or four weeks at
sullivans and during the whole of that
time i scoured the docks looking for a ship
masters and mates i interviewed by the
score some civilly declined my services
while others tired of being importuned by
the hosts of desperate sailormen thronging
the wharves kicked me off their decks with
curses and bitter oaths it was a miserable
lime cold receptions and cold weather for
a halfdad man and i think il i had re-
mained ashore any longer than i did i
would have thrown myself off the dock and
ended my misery
  i considered myself unusually fortunate
when the master of au english ship bound
for australia came along to the boarding-
house and picked me out to make up his
crew though i was a qualified navigator
and holding a lime-juice ticket for com-
petency as master mariner  was only too
glad to stick my fist on the articles of the
ship magician as an able seamen at twenty-
five dollars a month and two months ad-
vance my fifty dollars was to be paid after
the ship had sailed and mr sullivan took
the note in payment for board lodging
and outfit giving me a dollar to blow
myself with before i went aboard
  the dollar provided a few schooners of
beer for my less fortunate companions at
the boarding-house and with a dirty canvas
bag containing my outfit-a sackful of
straw known as a donkeys breakfast
shirt and pants made of dogs wool and
oakum a nondescript blanket and a pair
of second-hand sea-boots-i with the oth-
ers was escorted aboard the ship by sulli-
vans roughneck runners and taken in hand
by the mate
  a towboat hauled us down the harbor and
into the bay we were turned to rigging
out the jibboom setting up the headgear
and straightening out the riggers snarls
two days later we hauled out to the scot-
land lightship and made sail and if ever
a crew of shellbacks chantyed up topsail
halyards lustily it was the magicians
crowd
  i was something of a chantyman my-
self and i felt so good at smelling salt water
again and feeling a ships deck under my feet
that i sang and chorused for the sheer joy
of being outward bound by the aid of
muscles and whisky johnny were
all bound to go blow the man down
and santa anna won the day we mast-
headed the yards and sheeted home until
we had all the muslin flying and braces
strung and the big australiaman was
punching along with the lee froth bubbling
in the scuppers and licking over the topgal-
lant rail
chapter ii
i have a falling out
vxiten a man has been on the beach
	 for a long spell he appreciates being
at sea again new york and starvation
seemed like a bad dream and i was looking
the whaler

forward to a good time on the magician
her skipper seemed a very fine sort of man
and the mates were as good as sailors will
allow mates to be the grub was lime-
juicer style-not much of a variety but
it was of good qaulity and the bread barge
was always filled without question plenty
of biscuit meant plenty of those favorite
sea dishes cracker hash and dandyfunk
   the voyage also would be a lengthy one-
new york to melbourne via the cape and
melbourne to england by way of the horn
-and though i was serving in a subordinate
capacity yet i was glad to do it and happy
in the thought that i had shelter and food
for a year at least
   with a roaring westerly blowing over the
quarter we stood away to the eastard on
the old deepwatermans track to pick up
the northeast trades for a shoot across the
line and i can remember after my trick
at the wheel how delighted i was with the
ships running qualities and the easy man-
ner in which she steered this is quite an
important thing on an australian voyage
where over four thousand miles of easting is
run with square yards and a heavy sea
sailors have no use for a vessel that is likely
to prove a terror when running the east-
ing down
   we dropped the land astern that morning
during the day the wind held strong and we
sailed at the rate of knots with a main-
skysail set towards nightfall the wind
hauled southerly with fog when i came
on watch at four next morning the ship was
pitching and rolling in a lumpish sea while
fog shrouded everything the wind was
coming away squally and when our star-
bowlines mustered aft the second mate
passed the word in royals and flying jib
   we manned the royal gear and clewed up
the sails and while some of the watch went
aloft to furl i and two others went forard
on the fo c s le head to tackle the flying jib
the fog was very thick-so thick that it was
impossible to sec the flying jibboom from
the cathead i can remember after we had
slacked away on the halyards and manned
the downhaul the second mate coming
for ard and singing out to the three of us
   comeaft here some of you when you
git that jib down git the horn forard-
it s gittin thickern pea soup
   i gave my two mates a nudge
   run along- i said i can muzzle that
pocket handkerchief all right
  and while they made their way aft i
clambered over the bows and out to where
the flying jib was bellying and slatting
around in the breeze
  we carried one of those old-fashioned
sky-raking bowsprits protruding very far
out over the water and by the time i
reached the flying jibboom footropes the
vessel was blotted out in the thickness of
the vapor while the horn came through
the veil in a pitifully feeble drone as i lis-
tened to the roar of the bow wave beneath
and the scarce-heard wail of the horn and
saw the dim halo of our lights i thought it
would be just the kind of morning for a bad
collision the notion made me shiver and
look around apprehensively but the slatting
jib gave me little time for thoughts of that
nature clambering up the stay i was busi-
ly engaged in stamping the hanks down
with my sea-booted feet
  humming a little song to myself i was
passing the stops when the wail of a fog-
horn came to my ears i listened intently
thinking at first that it was our own as i
paused in my work with nerv es astrain a
wall of misty whiteness came sweeping out
of the murk on our starboard while i
yelled in excited fright the luminous bulk
took the shape of the headsails and double
topsails of a large ship crossing our bows
things happened with frightful
suddenness while i hung to the
rolled-up canvas of the flying jib
with skin tingling and hair raised in alarm
the other vessel stormed past and i thought
she was going clear until i saw myself look-
ing down over her deck and felt the tip of
the boom strike the strangers mizzen rig-
ging as soon as i felt the shock i jumped
and landed with a thump into the bottom of
a quarter-boat outslungon davits and while
i was picking myself up there was a crash
a volley of shouts and curses and then both
vessels must have gone clear
  my legs seemed paralyzed and i fancied
for a moment that i had broken my back
when i struck the thwarts of the boat but
in a few seconds the numbness departed
and  became conscious of a hoarse voice
shouting
  fetch a lantern here some o you that
blasted dutchman has stove th whole
quarter in-th bloody bumpkins gone
braces adrift look alive
  a lantern was brought casting a halo of

adventure
yellow in the mist and a voice came booming
hows that boat is she stove
thought i hard somethin failin into it
look an see
  now i was fully conscious of everything
that was happening below me but i made
no attempt to rise out of the boat i dont
know why probably i had not recovered
from the shock anyway i lay across the
thwart until a mans head appeared over
the gunwale and i was revealed in the light
of the lantern he held
  sink me he shouted heres a man a
lyin in here-
  is he dead boomed the commanding
voice below
  are ye dead shipmate questioned the
man in all seriousness flashing the lamp
over me
 no i managed to answer just
shook up a bit thats all ill tumble out
if youll give me a hand
  and i crawled painfully over the gunwale
and stepping down on deck found myself
in the midst of a mob of men one of them
a great black-bearded fellow grasped the
lantern and held it up in front of my face
  waal an where did you spring from
he asked harshly
  fell off the jibboom of that other ves-
sel i replied
  oh ye did did ye
the mans tone was vindictive and nasty
where in the blazes were yer eyes
couldnt ye hear us what vessel was that
anyway one o yer cape horners out t
trim th fly in cloud eh
  no sir i answered respectfully she
was an english ship-the magician bound
from new york to melbourne-
  huh bloody lime juicer might ha
known it starvation an ease an watch
on deck snoozin in th lee o somethin
stead o keepin a good lookout
grumbling to himself he laid the lantern
on deck
  an who told ye t come aboard here
he continued what dye think were goin
t do with ye
  ill turn to i answered
  yell turn to will ye he snapped
an what dye think were runnin-a
blasted sailors home for every calashee
scrub that flops aboard this is a whaler
not a packet ship have you ever gone
whalin
  i replied in the negative a whalerl a
dirty oily spouter outward bound most
likely on one of their two and three year
voyages whales hips a merchant sailors
horror he watched me with his savage
eyes glinting in the light of the lamp
  kin ye swim he inquired threateningly
  yes sir  replied wondering at the
mans peculiar aggressiveness
  waal i callate yed better start in an
do it he growled menacingly over th
rail ye go now or ill help ye
  what i cried in horrified consterna-
tion good heavens sir you dont mean
that
  there was no mistaking his words when
he advanced toward me with his shoulders
hunched and arms outstretched the men
who had been working at the port braces
knocked off to look on as the great brute
advanced i whipped out my knife
  sheer off i snarled i dont know
whether youre joking or not but by th
hook block ill give you a tight if youre
looking for one
  he stopped short on seeing the knife in
my hand
  trundle that out of his fist he cried to
the assembled men give him a toi v
dont want him aboard here
  a rough-looking fellow picked j capstan
bar out of the rack and came towards me
with the weapon upraised for a blow i
backed to the taflraii with my left arm over
my head and the knife grasped tightly in
my right fist with wits working and eyes
roaming for a chance of escape from the
murderous intent of the whalers crew
  it was unheard of a ghastly nightmare
and momentarily i expected to awake and
find it all a bad dream i can remember the
savage faces illuminated in the foggy glare
from the lantern and in their countenances
not a revelation of pity or horror was
shown the black-bearded man was staring
at me with a sinister wolfish look in his
eyes and the man advancing with the bar
seemed to be imbued with a certain joy of
combat a lustful brutal expression in his
face and figure which made me make up
my mind to ruh in and drive my knife into
his heart
then of a sudden the man paused
and lowered his weapon
  why sink me i believe its
jack dixon what was second mate o th
bahama belle-
the whaler

   eh snapped the man of the beard
 on the mention of my old blockade run-
 ners name i recognized the man who had
 identified me as joe smith one of her crew
 who had escaped prison some time before i
 did and clutching at a straw i lowered my
 knife
   aye right you are joe i said and
 im thinking this is a poor reception for an
 old shipmate
   joe turned and spoke to the other
   hes all right capen hes an old ship-
 mate o mine-second mate o th bahama
 belle runnin th yankee lines between new
 providence an charleston good fel-
 low-
   the whaler captain made a gesture
 come here you put up your dirk we
 were only jokin
   thinking it was a particularly callous
 and bloody-minded joke i slipped the
 knife into the sheath and stepped gingerly
 forward
   kin ye navigate
   yes sir i replied
   the skipper turned to joe
   kin he
   oh yes sir replied the man hes
 a navigator all right
   i hold a british board of trade certifi-
 cate of competency as master i volun-
 teered
  then by judas youre th man we
 want cried the whaling skipper bringing
 his heavy hand down on my shoulder
 lord harry but i thought ye were
 nawthin more nor less than some poor devil
 of a foremast hand an ye kin navigate
 eh take sextant sights by th sun eh
 yes sir and by the moon and stars as
 well
   i hastened to add my accomplishments
 time sights double altitudes and lunars
 for chronometer ratings-ive had practise
 with them all and if you have instru-
 ments-
   we have them he interrupted come
 down below sir
   and he led the way into the cabin
chapter iii
the whaler and her crew
 txhen i was precipitated upon the
 whaling vessel in the manner de-
 scribed i calculated that we were to the
southard of nantucket shoals the whaler
had fitted out in new bedford and had
stood to the southard for an offing after
clearing buzzards bay coming about she
was running to the eastard when she crossed
the magician s bows and narrowly escaped
being cut in half so the black-bearded
man told me as he lit the cabin lamp and i
knew then that i was on an outward bound
spouter
  im th master o this vessel he said
as he motioned me to be seated on the
cushioned transom my names silvera
-captain rodriquez silvera an this ves-
sels the whalin bark arclurus bound on a
southern sperm-whale cruise im no navi-
gator cept by dead reckonin an my first
officer who was supposed to do th naviga-
ting has gone an died on me came aboard
in noo bedford full as a tick took to his
bunk an croaked this momin youll
come in nice an handy to take his place
an i reckon you wont kick eh
  i wont kick captain
  not even for a long whalin cruise
no sir i replied but im no whale-
man-
  ye dont need t be he answered all
as well ask ye t do ull be t navigate th
vessel t where we want her t go ye dont
have nawthin t do with th whalin part
of it navigate an thats all ill give ye
fifty dollars a month an ye kin live aft
here
  ye kin take that gaudy first mates
room an his gear as soon as we git him
cleared out- wait a minute ill have
him cleared out now sos ye kin take aholt
an start right in
  he arose and clambered up the compan-
ionway steps and i could hear him calling
to the watch on deck wtien he came be-
low again four ragged-looking unkempt
ruffiais followed him
  git tliat stiff outa his bunk an heave
him over th rail-
  sew him up sir inquired one of the
men
  heave him over i said snapped cap-
tain silvera sharply ive got no can is
to waste on that beach-comber ye kin
lash somethin to his heels as a sinker-
no blast him jest shove him over as he is
go ahead now
  and while i remained seated mute with
surprise and shocked at such callou words
the men entered the mates room and
s
adventure
unceremoniously lugged the dead body of a
man out of the berth and up on deck i
could hear their feet shuttling along the
planks overhead heard the barking one
two three an heave as they swung
their burden and then the sullen splash as
the body struck the water captain sil-
veras harsh voice roused me from the terror
of my thoughts at this uufeeling piece of
desecration
  your rooms ready for ye mister dixon
but afore ye turn in id like ye t fix up our
course  want t shape for th western
islands heres th chart dividers rulers
an pencil
  i gave him the course in a few seconds
and he shouted it up the open companion-
way to the deck officer
      thus within twenty-four hours i
was metamorphosed from jack dix-
on a b on the merchant ship
magician to mister dixon navigating officer
on the whaling bark arclurus i had
changed my flag from the blood and guts
of old england to the stars and stripes of the
united states
  i had twice been in danger of losing my
life-i had no doubt whatever that captain
silvera would have given me a swim had
not joe smith recognized me and mentioned
the fact that  was a navigator-and here
i was logged for a lengthy voyage with
exceedingly doubtful company a brute of a
portuguese yankee for skipper and in a
trade which i as a merchant sailor de-
tested with the hereditary hatred of the
bluewater shellback however i was in no
position to choose i had benefited by the
change which luck had hove me into but a
nameless dread gripped my heart whenever
i thought of the incident of the early morn-
ing and i shivered involuntarily as i step-
ped into the berth assigned to me
  scratching a match i found the bulkhead
lamp and lit it and by its feeble light i saw
that the room was of the ordinary type with
bunk and drawers underneath a washstand
with a tumbler and water-bottle rack over it
a small table and a clothes locker at the
foot of the bunk was a bookshelf equipped
with a brine-stained navigator by
nathaniel bowditch a book of azimuth
tables nautical almanac directories and
sailing directions and a few shallow
novels of the type affected by some officers
completed the library the bedclothes in
the bunk were dirty and disarranged and i
had another shock when i saw that the pil-
low was stained with blood
  lord harry  muttered apprehen-
sively what lind of a packet have i
blown aboard of
  silvera opened the door at this juncture
he must have noticed me staring at the
bloody pillow
  ill get th stooard t dear that dunnage
away an put fresh clothes in that bunk
he said as he entered youre wonderin
whar that mess came from eh
  and as i nodded dumbly he laughed
that come from his head he was
drunk when he come aboard in noo bedford
an fell down th cabin gangway an stove
his thick skull i callate thats what fin-
ished him
  then with an assumption of heartiness
he slapped me on the back
  you dont want t mind our little joke
this rnornin dixon we whalers are rough
an ready but we dont mean no harm
marchant ways aint whaleship wavs
thar aint no brass an gold lace al-nr-i
these craft but youll find thingsll be all
right ef ye do yer duty now i reckon
yell find lamsons rig-out ull ab-ut lit ye
so jest take em an use em
  thars a good kumometer here-a noo
one showin greenwich mean time an
rated one second slow daily ive kep it
wound up while that joker was ivin on his
beam ends ive got a sexant in my berth
which ill hand ye later git them lime-
juicers dungarees off ye an come t break-
fast itll be ready in a few minutes
  feeling a little more composed men-
tally i changed my tarry rags for more re-
spectable apparel and sat down to break-
fast with the queerest company of human
beings it was ever my lot to be shipmates
with two of the men were vellow-skinned
portuguese half-breeds from the azores
named fernandez and francisco the other
two were polynesians-one being without
doubt the ugliest and most ferocious look-
ing character  had ever seen his cheeks
were tattooed in bluish concentric rings
while his huge white teeth were filed into
saw-like poin ts when he smiled the aspect
of his countenance was frightful and repel-
lent all four were clad in colored flannel
shirts and they ate like wolves boiled beef
and coffee disappearing down their capaci-
ous mouths like coal into a furnace
the whaler

  having spent a good deal of time in the
southern states i could be excused for
wondering why four blacks were allowed
to eat aft in the cabin the skipper must
have sensed my mental astonishment
  let me make ye acquainted with th
second an fourth mates fernandez and
francisco nodded the other gents are
hilo peter an tahiti jack-our harpoon-
eers
  the polynesians grinned acknowledg-
ment tahiti jack looking a veritable ogre
with his disfigured cheeks and serrated
teeth
  i have seen some hard cases in my day
but that whalers crew impressed me as
being the most cut-throat looking crowd
i ever clapped eyes on not a man but
what had a scar or disfigurement of some
sort on his person all had a lurching hard-
bitten appearance while the language they
used was vile enough for an atlantic packet
ships focsle
the vessel seemed to me to be
rather an unusual craft for the whal-
ing business by recollection of sun-
dry nantucketers and vineyard haven
spouters i had seen at sea being vastly
different from the a returns in almost every
way the orthodox south-seaman was a
square-stemed apple-bowed type ff wind-
jammer clumsy looking with wretchedly
cut sails bowsprit steeved up like a mast a
housed-in poop and no sail above topgal-
lants
  the arcturus had clipper lines and all
the appearance of a clipper her yards
were very square her masts lofty and with
a rake aft and the length of mast above her
main royal induced me to believe that she
once crossed a sky sail yard she was a
clipper to sail as well silvera afterwards
told me that she had beeen built for the
live ebony trade-otherwise slaving-
out when she had been put out of that busi-
ness he and a few others had bought her and
fitted her out for whaling
  something of her appearance was spoiled
by the ungainly whaleboat davits-three to
starboard and one to port two spare boats
lay bottom-up on the gallows aft and amid-
ships were placed the brick tryworks with a
huge pile of kindling-wood stacked around
them on top of the forard house was a
great tarpaulined box which i deduced was
a water tank
  i counted thirty men in our crew they
seem to have been composed of even na-
tionality under the sun-americans portu-
guese scotch english polynesians scandi-
navians and negroes a rough-and-tough
looking crowd but all expert whalemen
filling the positions of harpooners boat
steerers coopers blacksmiths and seamen
so much for the arcturus and her company
chapter iv
i drink with silvera
we picked up the northeast trades
after sighting gran canaria and in
sunshine under blue skies and over bluer
water we ambled lazily on our aimless
course at night we hove to in order to
cover the whaling grounds in daylight
  silvera remained as agreeable as ever but
the man seemed to be utterly heartless
though i can not say he was severe in hand-
ling the crew in fact he permitted liberties
which would not have been tolerated for an
instant upon merchant ships he was pleas-
ant to talk to and a good conversationalist
but i cannot remember in any of his dis-
courses with me a single sentence which
revealed a trace of sympathetic utterance
  he was an atheist and a man who scorned
emotion of any sort and from the amount
of knowledge he seemed to possess regarding
the congo and bonny rivers benin and the
dahomey coast i surmised that he had
been a slaver captain or officer at some time
in his life men who can calmly jettison
their living cargo into a shark-infested sea
when pursued by a cruiser have case-
hardened their hearts against any appeal to
feeling and compassion
  looking over the notes from which i am
compiling this narrative i find but a daily
sequence of entries for the next two weeks
  fine weather wind n e fresh vessel
under all plain sail running to sthard people em-
ployed on gear no fish sighted lat by obs-
long-log-bar- so ends this day
  at night we brought to the wind
  according to my instructions from sil-
vera we gave the cape verde islands a
wide berth and stood well over to the east-
ward of the thirtieth meridian
  a good whalin ground explained the
skipper then well go to the brazil
bank
adventure
  but luck seemed to have deserted us on
reaching our objective point and though the
mast lookouts were manned all day not a
single hail of there she blows was
sounded
  as we were right in the track of the home-
ward-bound ships from australia and the
cape bound for the british channel as
well as the outward ships from american
ports we saw many of them at a distance
with the desire for sighting and hailing
passing vessels which is imbued in all deep-
water sailormen silvera would always evince
an interest in the cape horners flying past
and endeavor to speak them as home-
ward-bound deep water clippers are in a
hurry to get to port none of them thought
of backing the maintopsail to gam with
a dirty spouter
  too good a breeze hereabouts for those
fellows captain i remarked one day after
a big dipper with stunsl out had ignored our
signal well have to get down in the
variables for speaking ships up in the
trades theyre all for cracking on
  aye i reckon so he answered i
want t git some stuff for th medicine chest
an a little lime-juice dont want no scurvy
t break out now th fresh meat an vegeta-
bles are done
thus passed the lazy days tack-
ing to windward for a day lying to
at nights and running down the
wind at times we literally became an ocean
loafer whales were conspicuous by their
absence and i would have welcomed the
sight of one as eagerly as the oldest whale-
man aboard i was becoming heartily tired
of this dolce far nientc with nothing to do
but squint at the sun and wind up a chro-
nometer there were no books aboard
save what i found in my own room and to
while away the time i read the trashy novels
from cover to cover and even perused the
dry sailing directories and the nautical
almanac
  i had thought of taking silvera in hand
and teaching him the use of sextant and
chronometer but on second thought i
dedded that the less he knew about naviga-
tion the better for me that he knew noth-
ing about the science was correct as i was
not long in finding out though it struck
me as being rather an unusual thing for the
master of a deep-sea vessel to be ignorant
of navigation yet it was by no means un-
  common in certain trades in the pacific
i had known island trading vessels in com-
mand of masters who were not qualified as
navigators while many sealers have two
captains-one as sailing master and the
other a practical sealer and ice expert
  l he skippers penchant for chasing ves-
sels was encouraged by me as i hoped to
beg some reading matter from the first
craft that would wait for a boat from us
so when f came on deck one morning and
found us storming after a big full-rigged
ship whose upper canvas was just lifting
above the horizon to the eastard i was as
eager as any one aboard to overhaul her
with royals mastheaded we brought the big
ship broad on the bow before noon and
though she had lower and topmast stunsis
out we were overhauling her hand over
fist
  have a squint at her said silvera
handing me the glass what dye think
she is
  english ship i answered as on as i
looked at her australiaman or a tea
packet from china shes a big lump of a
vessel but i think we could sail rings round
her-
  waal well have a closer look at her
an see ef we kin induce her stubr rn lime-
juice skipper to back his maintops ii for a
spell well go below an have dinner now
  i had never known silvera to be so pleas-
ant before he joked with the officers and
kanakas and laughed heartily over my
remark that the homeward - bounders
would think that the flying dutchman had
shifted his cruising ground by the way we
were chasing them all
  it was a pointless joke but it evidently
tickled his fancy immensely
  ha ha ha flyin dutchman he
guffawed great-simply great dixon
well crack a bottle over that by godfrey
stooard fetch a bottle of rum here
the liquor was brought i filled my
glass and drank to his good health he had
scarce put his lips to the tumbler before
francisco sung out down the companion-
way
  better come on deck capen hagen
is took bad with his stomach again-
  silvera rose from his seat angrily
  cuss hagen he growled why dont
he die or git well-
  as he stepped up the companion he
turned and spoke to me
the whaler

  youll excuse me a minute dixon
hagen is delirious again i callate punish
th bottle ill be back in a minute
  the rum was particularly good and i
must have punished the bottle although i
have no recollection of drinking more than
two three-finger nips i remember the
others getting up from the table and going
on deck then a feeling of intense drowsiness
took possession of me and i staggered over
to the transom and went to sleep
chapter v
i overhear some talk
 jltey thar rouse an shine
        i was shaken violently and opened
by eyes to find captain silvera leaning
over me with his hand on my shoulder
there was a smile on his face
  waal sink me he rumbled ef you
aint th primest hand for knockin out a
long calk i dont know who is lord
harry man yeve been on yer beam ends
for most two watches-
  funny thing i muttered drowsily
  whats funny
my sleepin like this im no seven
sleeper must have been that rum-
   you jest bet it was replied silvera with
a laugh cripes man ye sat down an
finished th whole bottle
  the whole bottle why i only remem-
ber taking two nips-
  infernal big nips dixon reglar sec-
ond mates four-finger whacks they must
ha bin come turn out an have some
supper
  with all the feelings of a man recovering
from a drinking bout i rolled off the tran-
som and soused my aching head in a basin
of cold water then i staggered over to the
table and sat down to the supper the stew-
ard had laid out for me the skipper was
in his room but came out and helped him-
self to a slice of cold beef and a biscuit
did you get anything from that lime-
wc werc chasing i inquired sleepily
beggar refused t heave to replied
silvera her skipper told me t go to thun-
r  asn t supplyin yankee spouters
with medicines an stores every time they
nailed for them mean sorter swab he was
but i had th laugh on him jest th same
hows that
swiped two of his men away from him
  what i ejaculated in surprise
swiped two of his men how
  they jumped overboard when we ranged
to windard of him an before old bully th
britisher cd git a boat off th chocks i
lowered an scoffed them in front o his eyes
he howled an jumped round like a sperm
bull in a flurry
  whatever made two members of a home-
ward-bounders crew jump for a yankee
whaler i questioned doubtingly
  they were in trouble with the after
guard some fracas i reckon which they
stood a chanst o being jailed for in eng-
land its a great joke on mr johnny bull
now sir when youve finished id like ye
t shape a course for t keep in th track o
them cape horners i must git medicines
an limejuice hagen is pretty sick an
some o th crowd forard are showin signs
o scurvy
  i pushed my cup away from me and
looked at him in some surprise
  why i replied wonderingly were
right in the sailing track now all the
homeward-bound craft from the southard
plan to cross the line in twenty-three west
or thereabouts but what dye want to
speak north-bound vessels for why dont
you hail the outward-bounders
  why dont ye make for the cape verde
islands you can get all the fresh vegeta-
bles oranges limes and fresh truck you
want there and its only a couple of days
sail to the eastard
  and i glanced at him with a vague dis-
trust in my mind
  silvera laughed
  my dear dixon its easy seen that
youve never been skipper of a whalin
craft as a marchant sailor itll seem queer
to you but its ornary enough to us spouter
men we never git nawthin from the out-
ward-bounders they have th best part of
their vyge afore them an consequently
they keep a tight fist on their auti-scorbu-
tics cause they never know how long theyre
agoint be box-haulin about in the varia-
bles north an south o th line th home-
ward craft have a port most over their
bows when they get north o twelve latitude
an ef theyve got potatoes limejuice an
sich truck aboard theyll give it freely
cause theyre most home y see
  but why dont you make the islands
and do away with this chasing for to beg
stores

adventure
  now thars another thing bout whalers
ye dont know dixon i dursent make a
landfall in a place like cape verde or some
o my bullies ull skip out some o them
are sick o th vyge already an ef they
thought st vincent was anywheres near
them portygees aboard here ud swim ashore
even ef we lay ten mile off now dye un-
derstand
  i nodded and with his plausible explana-
tions my doubts fled
  well captain just keep her about as
we are and youll raise all the cape horn
fleet besides the river platers and the
indiamen
next morning i noticed the two
strangers loafing around the focsle
door with others of our crew it
was evident that they had fallen among
friends by the manner in which the others
hung around listening to every word they
were sav ing however i did not pay much
attention to them though i could hardly
credit any sailor leaping overboard from a
homeward-bound britisher and taking a
chance of being picked up in a shark-
infested sea by an american whaling bark
the fellows looked tough enough to have
done anything up to murder and there was a
possibility that they had done as captain
sdvera had said
  during the day wre raised the royals of a
large american ship and we bore away until
we had him close aboard silvera looked at
the vessel through his binoculars for a long
time and afterward i saw him conversing
with one of the new additions to our crew
when he came aft he ordered the helmsman
to come up and we braced the yards and
swung away without speaking merely dip-
ping the ensign
  whats the matter with him i in-
quired pointing to the other ship
  no good answered the skipper
thats th lillian cullen masters an old
shipmate o mine an i wouldnt ask him for
a rope-yarn hes a swab
  and he walked away
  humph i said to myself youre
infernally particular whalers ways aint
merchant ways thats a certainty first
vessel i was ever on that could afford to
loaf around and pick and choose the craft
shell speak for a bit of stores 
  early next morning another english
ship was sighted and given chase to and
again our skipper declined to speak her alter
he had overhauled the vessel when i
asked him his reasons he lost liis temper and
told me to mind my own business i did so
and retired to my bunk to think out a true
bill for all these peculiar happenings
  as it was very hot below decks i opened
the small square port in the cabin trunk
to let some air into my room and while i
laid ruminating and reflecting over the
events of the previous weeks i overheard
the skipper talking with one of the deserters
from the english ship the conversation
was disjointed but i listened in astonish-
ment to the words
  ye say john was shippin in melbun
   th next ship what had anythin
the stranger answered
  aye    fortnight or so    pot o
stuff cornin down country    big ben-
digo strike    ballarat 
  any difficulty    signin on
  none    eighty vessels when i left
   crews cut an run for diggins skip-
pers payin eight pounds a month for
a bs    easy
  what    ships name
  yankee built clipper    three sky-
slyarder    britisher    named sea 
  big ship    loaded 
  then i heard my name mentioned by the
stranger
	aye    curious beggar    dixon
   navigator    fell off jibboom ye
say
  silveras growling voice replied and i
strained my ears
  yes    hard job    hocused him
   bottle    rum    knows naw-
thin
  and they moved away
 hocused bottle of rum i mut-
tered humph thats why i slept so
hard theres something mighty fishy
aboard this packet and i set my wits to
work
  why should i have been drugged what
happened to make silvera remove me from
the scene for a space how comes he to be
so familiar with a runaway sailor from an
english ship what had he to do with
john who was shipping in melbourne
what had the yankee-built clipper sea-
something-or-other to do with a whaling
bark or silvera himself why should i be
the subject of discussion between my skip-
per and a runaway stranger
the whaler

   i asked myself these questions a hundred
times and failed to find a possible solution
all morning i remained in my berth turning
the problems over in my mind until my
brain boiled and when i went on deck to
take a moon sight i made a resolution to
keep my weather eye lifting for squalls
chapter vi
  the arcturus hauls by the wind
r several days the skipper never
spoke to me then all at once he be-
came affable and friendly even making me
a present of some of his favorite cigars i
felt he had something up his sleeve and i
kept on my guard for new developments
we had been yarning away for a while when
he inquired suddenly-
   are you religious
   religious i reiterated well thats a
hard question to answer ive got as much
religion as most sailormen have a chance to
get but im no devil-dodger by any manner
of means ive lived pretty square though
and done my best for a shipmate-
  humph
  he interrupted with a grunt and con-
tinued pacing the quarter
   did you ever kill a man was his next
query
   no i replied decisively and i hope
i never will
   ever been in th live ebony trade ever
been privateerin
   no sir i answered but ive been
blockade running
   he seemed to think very little of that
and resumed his pacing
   looky here he continued pausing in
his three steps and a turn ef you got a
chanst to make a pile of dollars easily would
you be particular as to how ve got it espe-
cially ef nobody ud ever know or find out
a pile of dollars mind-a fortune enough
to low ye to retire an live at ease for th
rest of yer days eh
   that altogether depends captain im
open to grab all i can get but id like to
know how its to be done first
   say piracy-lootin vessels returned
hestanng jhto my face with a steady gaze
  -piracy i gasped lord man but
that s a terrible thing and means the gal-
lows if caught besides it means mur-
der-
  a fearful thought flashed into my mind
and he must have noticed the terror in my
eyes
  pah man he said with a half laugh
you must think im a second capen
kidd i dont mean this throat-cuttin
business black flag walkin planks an
that sorter guff i hev a little bit o a
scheme for borryin stores from them passin 
vessels an sellin them down south in th
falklands ye see while were cruisin on
these grounds we kin be askin passin ves-
sels for barrels o flour pork beef an sich-
like-
  he paused with a sheepish smile on his
face while i almost burst out laughing
what a mean cadging schemer he was
and this was his piracy holy sailor
i had met stingy skippers in my day but
this whaleman had them all hull dovn so
this was his little game this explained
his chasing of ships begging for stores to
sell on his own account
  you can count me in captain i an-
swered heartily i dont mind if thats
the game-
   sure thats what i was a drivin at but
i didnt know how ved look at the idea
  caramba i dont care a hang my
conscience dont bother me on that score
well hail every ship in sight and take all
we can get
  he laughed pleasantly and walked away
forard
wrhat a game i ruminated but as i
turned his conversation over in my mind i
began to think i was more of a fool than he
was what pile of dollars was to be made
out of a few barrels of stores why should
he ask me if id ever killed a man i was
beginning to get horribly tangled up in my
thoughts and as i was not particularly
quick-witted i judged i had better go below
and in the privacy of my berth overhaul my
experiences from the hour i was thrown
aboard the a rclurus
  i went over events from the time i was
threatened with a long swim and then came
the memory of the bottle of rum chasing
the english ship and the two supposed
strangers who came aboard mysteriously
while i laid in a drugged slumber the dis-
jointed conversation i had overheard and
now this farcical conversation with its pre-
posterous and picayune suggestion silvera
to make a fortune by such a petty scheme
pah it was unheard of
o
adventure
while i scratched my thick down-
east head in perplexity a hail from
aloft came to my ears
  vessel down to looard sir
  i rolled out and pulled on my boots
must go and see silvera cadging his
stores  muttered
  when  went on deck it was to see him
and one of the deserters aloft in the hoops
on the fore and main scanning the upper
sails of a ship which gleamed like tiny pearls
above the blue of the sea line when he
came down he gave me  knowing wink
and passed the usual order to bear down
  well borry somethin from this packet
i hope he said softly big ship-three
skysl-yarder
  i remained on deck for over an hour
until the other vessel hove her hull up above
the horizon she was a big ship deep-
laden and carrying double topsails single
topgallants royals and skysails on each
mast there was a fresh breeze blowing and
with all our own kites set and drawing our
little clipper bark sped rapidly through
the water in the direction of the stranger
  it was about four in the afternoon when i
went below to get a drink from the rack in
the saloon the skipper met me as i
stepped down the ladder
  where are ye goin he inquired
just to get a drink of water i replied
oh he muttered and he stepped on
deck as i went over to the table
  the steward was coming out of my room
just as i lifted the water bottle from the
rack and found it empty he looked across
at me quickly
  water sir youll find some fresh from
the tank in your room sir ill fill that one
in a minute
  he reached over for the bottle and i
handed it to him
  entering my room i closed the door
now i said to myself heres where i
get my bearings steward is a liar for he
filled my water bottle this morning before
i turned out
  i reached for the article and was just in time
to see the last grains of a whitish powder
effervescing into nothingness in the bottom
  just what i expected thought i the
rum bottle wont work twice but the water
bottle will humph
  with a plan of action mapped out i
poured the water out into a tumbler and
thence into the wash bucket then i threw
myself down on my bunk and awaited de-
velopments
  i must have been lying some twenty min-
utes when  heard stealthy footsteps ap-
proach my door and some one tapped
lightly
  mr dixon
  it was the stewards voice i shut my
eyes and snored
  mr dixon came the voice again and
the door was quietly opened and the man
entered the room  had my back turned to
him but i could almost sense everything
he did even to picking up the tumbler and
examining it after bending over me he
left the room and closed the door
  so much for him i murmured when he
had departed glancing out of the square
port above my bunk  could see the big
skysail-yarder coming up to leeward fear-
ing lest i should be seen staring through the
small window i half drew the curtain and
lay down again
  once more heavy footsteps approached
my door and a voice boomed
  dixon dixon
  it was silvera but i made no answer
then he looked in on me and i heard him
say to the steward who was in the cabin
  hes out of th way for a jong spell f
he drank a tumbler o that water look in
on him now an again
  and the door was closed quietly
there was a great deal of tramp-
ing overhead  felt that all hands
were out and preparing for some-
thing by the scurrying of booted feet w-hich
resounded on the deck above me silvera
was at the poop rail singing out orders
  check in weather braces square the
yards    git your engine set up camer-
on   whalin gear out o boats   
stand by
  i glanced through my port but could see
nothing but a portion of the quarter rail
and the empty sunlit sea
  now fernandez came the skipper s
strident voice got that brazilian ens n
bent ease down yer helm    slack
away weather haul taut lee braces
haul up on yer mainsl    haul up yer
fores    smartly men
  hauling by the wind i murmured
  as the bark heeled over with the pres-
sure i took another look through my port
and saw the strange ship close aboard she
i
the whaler

was a big two-thousand-tonner at least
with built lowermasts and long spars
  american built ship loaded with aus-
tralian wool for england was my mental
comment what a magnificent picture she
made with her snowy cotton duck canvas
full and drawing and her long black hull
slipping through the blue water with a line
of foam streaming aft from her beautiful
clipper bow
  i could make out the officer walking
the weather side of her long quarter see
the passengers she carried standing upon the
coach-house staring at us see too the
crews heads peering over the rail forard
and a man in a red shirt sitting astride of the
martingale stays under the bowsprit-evi-
dently spearing dolphin for he had a four-
pronged grain in his hand my attention
was suddenly arrested by the actions of
this fellow when he commenced waving his
neckerchief in a peculiar manner a voice
sounded close above me
  theres john capen dye see him
hangin to th martingale an wavin-
  startled i glanced at the clippers name
board on the quarter rail and read sea king
  sea king    three skysi-yarder   
melbourne    john i muttered and
i felt that something was going to happen
which would materially clear the fogginess
of my mind and elucidate the mystery
of the whaling bark arcturus and her pe-
culiar skipper
chapter vii
i quote from my log
 vtwhat ship is that came a faint hail
  	 from the clipper ship
  brazilian trainin frigate arcturus
thundered silvera
  brazilian frigate be blowed came from
the other and the voice continued
  sheer off now dye want to run us
down
  the sea kings lower sails were ashiver
owing to our stopping up the wind as we
were jammed up to windward we could not
bear away without coming down on the
other ship and i could hear the officers on
the australiaman cursing at us as they put
their helm up to get clear of us
  you confounded yankee spouter
bawled a little red-faced man shaking liis
list at us what in blazes d ye mean
  i could hear silvera laughing
  slap it into him cameron he cried
wheelhouse mind
  bang there came a detonation vhich
caused the arcturus to shake in even- plank
and as i stared in consternation through the
port i saw the sea kings wheelhouse liter-
ally swept from the deck in a crumple of
splinters-wheel-gear helmsman and the
wooden house knocked clean over the lee
quarter fascinated by the suddenness and
horror of the action i kept my gaze fixed on
the now unmanageable clipper heard the
shouts of fear and rage which came from her
people and saw the panic-stricken crew
running about on her decks an officer ran
to her break rail shouting
  haul aft your weather head sheets
slack away lee braces-
  sweep th quarter cameron roared
silvera excitedly dont give em a chance
to wear ship or theyll run away from
us-
  jbang another explosion and a wild yell
from our crew as the shot smashed across
the cabin trunk tearing skylights com-
panionway and chart-house into a shov er of
splinters and clearing the poop of all living
creatures
  give em another cameron bring
that mainmst down ef you can look out
for john
  john-the man in the red shirt-was still
astride the martingale and safe enough if
he stayed where he was
  before the third shot was fired i heard
footsteps approaching my room and i had
just time to fall back on my blankets and
commence snoring when some one looked
in on me the gun spoke again but i con-
trolled my nerves so that i made no move-
ment
  dead to th world muttered the in-
truder and the door was closed quietly
wrhen i stared through the port once more
it was to see the clipper ship lazily drifting
to leeward with yards abaci and sails slat-
ting the third shot had torn a great gap
in the bulwarks amidships but the main-
mast was still standing
  lower away yer boats commanded
silvera sharply fernandez take charge
and work down to looard an pick us up
when were ready
  i shall quote from my log as to what
happened next as i consider it requires no
elaboration

adventure
  four boats towered six men in cach au armed
with cutlases and firearms captain silvera in
leading boat two boats ranged to starboard and
two to port of sea king crew made fast to main
chains and scrambled aboard leaving one man in
boat	
  whalemen went aft in company with man in
red shirt a show of resistance was made by sea
kings officers some shots lired and ships people
driven forward and locked in focsle
  numerous boxes were fetched out of cabin and
lowered carefully into boats all boats returned
within half an hour to our vessel man in red shirt
coming off with silvera
  time  p m january   latitude
  north longitude   west  miles
east of cape verde
it was piracy-nothing more and
nothing less horrified by the events
i had witnessed i laid back on my
pillow while the crew hoisted their boats
and booty aboard a number of men
came down into the cabin and i was
conscious that silvera was among them
snatches of their conversation fell upon my
ears our villainous portuguese yankee
skipper was giving orders
  yes stow th stuff in th lazareet   
no hes sure for another six hours yet   
wont know anything easy now heavy
eh  a great haul 
  holy sailor cap but i was afraid yed
never show up an unfamiliar voice was
saying ive hardly slept a wink sence we
crossed th line you picked up billy all
right    good haul waal i callate
thatll finish us now an im cussed glad
whats yer plans for that joker t windward
soon be dark    better hurry
  the shuffling feet left the cabin and
there was a scurrying about on deck the
sea king was lying on our starboard side and
i was unable to see her from my window
  all right cameron sung out the skip-
per plant one amidships look sharp or
itll be dark
  the boom of the gun came to my ears and
i realized what the fiends were doing they
were sinking their victim
  i saw through every tiling now as i lay
with the clammy sweat breaking out on my
face the mysterious actions of the past two
months unfolded themselves before my men-
tal vision and the scales fell from my eyes
nineteenth-century pirates masquerading
in the guise of whalers it seemed impossi-
ble and improbable but what else would
account for the events and things  had seen
and heard the patrolling of the sailing
tracks the chasing of many ships upon triv-
ial pretenses the nature of our crew and
the skippers peculiar conversations two
vessels had been looted-i had no doubt
whatever that the ship we chased when i
was drugged had been despatched in a man-
ner similar lo the sea king-and upon both
ships were confederates who in some mys-
terious manner had means of communi-
cating with silvera
  how was it all arranged both ships were
australiamen homeward bound the con-
versation of silvera and the stranger came
to mind
  bendigo ballarat pot o stuff
coming down country he had said
  what stuff it was as plain as a dead-
eye to me now bendigo and ballarat the
new victoria goldfielcls where everybody
was flocking to the stuff gold
  bang the gun spoke again and changed
the tenor of my thoughts what would
happen to me it was a disturb - ig ques-
tion and i realized my helplessness could
silvera do without my services i couldnt
answer it was a deuce of a position for a
man to be in but after a vast amount of
brain-racking i concluded that the less i
pretended to know about what had hap-
pened the better for me if silvera thought
that i suspected his game i had absolutely
no doubt but what i would be given a toss
to the sharks men of silveras type had no
compunctions i knew that already
  my action after this may seem strange
but you must remember the state of mind i
was in i had been an eyewitness of an
act of piracy on the high seas i was among
a crowd of suspicious cutthroats who
wished me to know nothing a ship and her
human freight was being sunk alongside
and i was supposed to be oblivious to it all
in a drugged slumber to calm my nerves
and add realism to my feigned sleep i
poured out a small drink from the water
bottle and tossed it off within a minute
i could feel the drug working its soporific
influence i had a faint recollection of
hearing the boom of the gun again and
then i lost consciousness
chapter viii
i carry out a plan
t awoke naturally and saw that it
was daylight the steward was setting
the breakfast on the cabin table and feeling
as if i had passed a nightmarish sleep 
the whaler

turned out washed and went on deck
the steward looked sharply at me as i
passed but his good morning sir was
as civil as usual
  the skipper was pacing the trunk deck
when i came up the companion and he
hailed me with a laugh
  by th great horse-block he cried
have ye really woke up caramba i i
thought ye were in a trance by th way ye
snored th second mate said he cd hear
ye up on deck here cripes man but youre
a heavy sleeper
  i gave a sickly grin and he stepped
towards me
  run up agin another hard case yester-
day he said softly that skysl-yarder
was another screw said he wanted me t
pay for all th stuff i got so i swung off
my schemes no good dixon so well get
down to huntin whale again when yeve
fixed up th recknin ill ask ye t drive her
south thar aint no fish hereabouts so
well make th pacific an try th line
grounds thar south we go an ho for th
stormy horn
  i placed our position and give the course
for the line the bark had been lying to
the wind all night with fore and main royals
and topgallantsails furled and when i gave
silvera the course he sung out to the watch
loafing forard
  swing th mainyard make sail
  to the second mate pacing to leeward he
said
  get the muslin on her mr fernandez
weve a long stretch to make an we dont
want to be all year makin it rouse out yer
stunsl gear get th booms out an set
lower an topmst stunsls to port clew
up th maintack an sheet everything well
down this little barky is goint sail now
among the men hurrying around to exe-
cute the orders i noticed the fellow in the
red shirt and helping to break out the
booms and stunslyards lashed on top of the
forard house was hagen the sick man look-
ing as fit as he ever was yet silvera had
said he was delirious and dying
during the weeks which passed
on our run to the southard the skip-
per treated me with every courtesy
and i guarded my emotions so well that he
never suspected for a moment that i was
aware of the crimes which he and his crew
had committed lideed things were so
monotonous and usual that i began to doubt
myself the whole affair seemed but a vivid
dream
  though i hunted around for proofs to
substantiate my suspicions yet absolutely
nothing could i find no trace was there
of any gun aboard nor did i ever run across
any weapons other than a shotgun in sil-
veras room i knew that the officers had
revolvers-most officers have-but rifles
cutlases cannon and shells were conspicu-
ous by their absence
  as i was not an officer of the ship i had
no right to go prying around the vessel but
on the occasional strolls i made to the fo-
csle head i found nothing to characterize
the ardurus as being anything but what she
was-a whaling bark bound on her lawful
occasions with a perfect right to cruise
wherever she listed in pursuit of the ceta-
ceans i might have got substantial proof
if i could examine the lazaretto yet i knew
that any attempt on my part would mean
sudden death i did not try
  we passed the east falklands after a
fine run down and we crossed burdwoods
bank to edge up to the stormy comer of the
southern world the weather was fine for
the high latitudes-fresh souwesterly wind
and a smooth sea-and with royals furled we
swashed on our lonely way i had been
asleep all afternoon on the third day after
passing the falklands and in my stocking
feet i ascended the companion for a breath
of fresh air the night was black dark
filling my pipe in the gangway i stepped
on deck intending to ask the watch officer
for a match as i passed along the lee
alley towards the break rail i heard my
name mentioned by some one over to wind-
ward and stopped to listen
  with the sough of the wind and the wash
from our passage through the water the
conversationalists were obliged to speak
loudly and being to leeward i caught the
words distinctly
  get him out o th way after we make the
island    we dont want him after that
   need good navigator to pick it up
   afterwards i can take her to frisco
   think dixon knows anything
  it was slocums voice-he of the red
shirt-and he was talking to silvera
  nawthin    doped out both times
   albemarle    sea king get him
to fetch us to hiva nuku    jake
thompsonll have his schooner there an

adventure
well ship th stuff    give his a toss to
th sharks 
fearful of being discovered i
crept away with the hair of my head
tingling so that was the lay i
wras to be used for my navigating abilities
in picking up some pacific island rendez-
vous and then cast adrift like a worn-out
swab red shirt would navigate the bark
to san francisco-any one who could steer
and keep track of a log could do that but
picking up some isolated pacific atoll re-
quired more accurate knowledge
  slipping quietly into my room i lit my
pipe and turned into my bunk to think
things out a number of schemes came to
my mind but i dismissed them all as im-
probable and impossible i had no friends
among the crew whom i could rely upon
all were deep in the scheme and none would
act against silvera joe smith my former
shipmate of the blockade days had never
spoken a word to me since the eventful
night i fell aboard the bark and i knew i
could expect nothing from him
  escape was impossible if i attempted to
swim to a passing ship i would be shot or
quickly recaptured and the chances of
swimming in the icy seas of the southern
ocean were not feasible i couldnt launch
a boat without some one seeing or hearing
me i had to dismiss that i had no weap-
ons other than a sheath-knife and even if i
had a revolver what could i do with it
shoot silvera and a few others maybe but
it would not be long before i would be killed
myself no i had to admit that my chances
were mighty slim
  i reached down a chart of cape horn and
the straits of magellan and studied it for a
moment and i remembered how that very
morning i had to explain to silvera the
great easterly variation which prevailed in
the vicinity he had questioned me with
regard to the amount of wasting in the
course i had given him in his ignorance he
had reckoned when steering south the
course should necessarily be south varia-
tion deviation and other errors of the com-
pass being a mystery to him
  it was the easterly variation which gave
me the idea desperate and all as it was
i decided that it was the only thing i could
do if i were destined to die then i would
take good care that others went with me
briefly i determined that  would put
the arcturus ashore on one or other of the
dangerous rocks which fringed the horn
   lay awake the best part of the night
smoking and thinking at da s light i
slipped into my pocket a steel watchchain
i had found in the desk and went on deck
francisco the watch officer was lolling
over the break rail forard and a stupid
chileno was at the wheel going over to
the compass  told him to steer by the
weather leach of the maintogallansi for a
minute standing in front of him i took
off the binnacle hood noted the point at the
lubber mark on the compass and after
slipping the steel chain under the right
side of the card i placed the cover on
again
  all right i growled to the helmsman
keep her as she was
  and i left him pulling the spokes over to
head up on the vast amount of westing i
had introduced into the compass
  now i muttered ill play a little
game of my own captain silvera and we 
see who wins out-you or me if i cant
pile you up inside of twenty-four hour then
im a dutchman
  at noon i got a sight and fixed our posi-
tion as some eighty miles northwest of
staten island there was a fresh breeze
blowing and we were logging seven to eight
knots with a southerly wind we were sail-
ing close-hauled heading about w s w
by correct compass course but in reality
the bark was actually making that course
as my steel chain more than compensated
for the easterly variation
  now sir i said to the skipper after i
had shown him our position on the chart
well be opening out the horn by daylight
and were feeling the set of the south drift
now crack on and make the most of this
breeze weve plenty of sea room to clear
cape st john and we want to make all the
westing we can while the wind holds
  he nodded curtly when he went on
deck i heard him singing out for the fore
and main royals topmast staysails and
gaff-topsail to be set
  now said i to myself slam away
you bloody-minded pirate four bells in
the first watchll have us trying to push
staten island out of the water and a grand
ice shore the cliffs will make with this
souther blowing there are no lights in
this part of the world and theres sure to be
fog inshore and its a safe bet that no
the whaler

lookout will ever report land until the
breakers are heard
       the afternoon seemed intermina-
bly long and as it was summertime
down south the night came tardily
over the waste of rolling gray sea and
grayer sky i paced the quarter smoking
until nine oclock looking over the log
slate in the chart-house i made a mental
calculation of our position as being about
fifteen miles off the land the breeze still
held strong and the vessel was storming
steadily on the course i had laid for her
within two hours she would strike
  i glanced around the ship heard the
growling talk of the watch mustered aft in
the lee of the half deck smoking and yarn-
ing heard a ribald chorus come from the
focsle and saw fernandez steadily pacing
the weather alley silvera was below asleep
the harpooners were playing cards in the
half deck a shivering negro tugged with
mittened hands at the spokes of the wheel
  all were oblivious to impending disaster
but they deserved the fate i had in store
for them and when i felt my nerve waver-
ing i thought of the murdered crews of the
albemarle and sea king aye i could
save my sympathy
  i went below and locked myself in my
room sitting on the transom i made a
mental overhaul of my life and finding
the slate fairly clean waited calmly for
the crash which meant the end
chapter dc
       silvera and i are quits
hthe reader of this narrative will proba-
a bly think i was extremely phlegmatic
in my desperate actions i was life held
very little for me then i had no home and
no relations no friends except an odd ship-
mate here and there i held a masters cer-
tificate but hard times and hard experi-
ences had practically killed all my ambition
and i hated the life i was living hated the
sea hated everything existence for me
had by now developed into a mere pro-
longation of life by eating and drinking
scheming and planning had jaded my brain
and i was quite prepared to die if i could be
sure of blotting out the horde of scoundrels
i was shipmates with god would give me
credit for that i was sure

  therefore it was with an easy conscience
that i waited for the inevitable and with-
out any nervousness i turned into my
bunk when the bark struck i would re-
main where i was just as easy to die below
decks as to be engulfed and tossed about in
the open
  i must have fallen into an apathetic doze
for when i awoke it was to hear femande
scream inarticulate words down the com-
panionway the quietness of the night was
broken by a sonorous booming when a
medley of shouts and running feet sounded
overhead i knew we wtere in the breakers
i felt the bark staggering and lurching
heard the steward open his door and clatter
up the ladder and silvera roaring and
swearing
  some one shrieked hard down hard
down and then came a frightful shock
  i was hurled bodily to the floor i made
no attempt to rise but lay where i fell
listening to the thunder of the waves
breaching over the vessel and the hoarse
shouts of the panic-stricken crew the
bark was lifting and pounding with dreadful
concussions upon the rock or ledge and
amidst the din of falling spars rending
woodwork and crashing seas the voice of
silvera could be heard directing the launch-
ing of a boat with frightful oaths
  all hands seemed to have swarmed aft
on to the poop i could hear the stamping
and shuffling of their booted feet on the deck
above me their yells and curves and the
boom and crash of the boarding breakers
then i remember slocum bawling some-
thing about dead wall of rock ahead and
drop off jibboom there was more
stamping of the booted feet and some one
clattered down the companion ladder
  dixonyou swine ahoy dixon where
are you you dog bum my soul but ill
cut yer heart out and a string of vile
oaths
  it was silvera i made no answer he
groped about in the darkness until he came
to my door he tried the handle finding
it locked he roared
 open th door you-- youve
spiked me but by - ill spike youl
open
  receiving no answer he hammered on
the panels with his fists snarling like a dog
and swearing dreadfully the vessel shud-
dered to the shocks of the waves breaking
over her then came a resounding crash

adventure
on the deck above with a splintering and
tearing of woodwork and a roaring welter
of sea came like a cataract into the cabin
the water was spurting into my room
through the cracks in the door i expected
that the end was coming silvera was still
in the cabin but he had desisted from his
endeavor to force an entrance to my room
i expect he thought i was dead
the water was swashing over my
body with every pound of the vessel
when she suddenly canted to star-
board and i was thrown violently against
the bulkhead as my room was to port
the water drained out and i found myself
lying on the wet planking and still very
much alive instead of wishing to die a
desire to live was beginning to take pos-
session of me and i rose to my feet
  the vessel was not pounding now and
though she trembled to the shocks of the
seas which broke over her hull yet it
seemed to me she was far from breaking up
the massive oak beams and stanchions in
my berth were still holding in spite of the
awful hammering the bark had undergone
and i noticed that the oak hanging-knees
had not started nor had the planking open-
ed up i could not see through the port
owing to the fact that the deadlights had
been shipped over them when we passed the
rio plata in readiness for the stormy
weather of the horn
  the shocks were perceptibly lessening
and as i puzzled myself for an explanation
i remembered the tide
  why to be sure the tide is falling and
we must have canted over with our decks
toward the shore thus thinking i struck
a match and lit a candle
  quietly unlocking my door i peered out
the lee side of the cabin was swashing
with water and littered with the debris of
table and seats a great gap where the
skylight had been yawned overhead and
across the square of gray daylight which
showed came streams of chilly spray the
candle was blown out but there was enough
light to discern things by as i glanced
around the flooded apartment i could see
no sign of silvera
  must have gone on deck i murmured
and scrambling across the sloping floor i
crawled up the companionway and looked
around on the ruin i had wrought it was
blowing very hard and the spindrift from
the welter of whitcwater we were lying in
was flying athwart the air ahead towered
a great wall of cliff which loomed hazily in
the half light of the semi-antarctic morning
and which was blotted from sight inter-
mittently by veils of rainy mist
  i he vessel was lying over on her star-
board bilge with her bottom facing seaward
all the masts had gone by the board and
could be seen in a tangled ralbe of spars
canvas and cordage swashing among the
rocks at the foot of the dills the forard
house was still standing and i made out
something which had been a mystery to me
the tank which had once reposed on top of
the house had disappeared and in its stead
i saw the shining barrel of a cannon known
as a parrott rifle-gun
as my eyes got used to the gloom
i saw that we were lying in a slight
indentation in the cliff wall-a sort
of cove or fiord with a litter of broken rocks
and boulders rising in a steep pile to the
apex of a triangle formed by two unbroken
walls of stone by crawling forard and
clambering out on the bowsprit t would be
possible to drop on to dry land and with
the craving for life still strong within me i
jumped below to ransack the pantry for
food and water the storeroom lay to
starboard and to reach it i had to wade
waist deep in chilly water
  entering i stulled my pockets and the
inside of my shirt with biscuits and some
dried apples there was no water in the
place and trusting to find some when i
reached the shore i crawled along the
weather rail to the focsle head and out
on the bowsprit the headstavs were dang-
ling down from the spar and i was soon
slipping and sprawling around on the weed
and kelp covered rocks
  before  gained high-water mark i was
destined to stumble over three almost un-
recognizable bodies but the sight excited
no qualms of conscience they deserved
their fate and though i had the blood of
some thirty-three men on my head  felt
that i had become but an instrument of
vengeance in the hands of a just deity
  heedless of the cold i scrambled up the
slippery boulders to the apex of the cleft
it was with some satisfaction that i noted
that the cliffs were not so inaccessible as
they appeared from seaward there were
numerous ledges and cracks which would
the whaler

not make climbing difficult to a sailorman
used to scaling giddy heights
  i was tightening my belt and buttoning
up my coat in preparation to make the as-
cent when i heard the rattle of boulders
behind me and i wheeled around in time to
see silvera in the act of hurling a mighty
rock in my direction with a smothered
oath he hove the stone and i leaped aside
in time to escape being dashed to the
ground
twy i had no weapons and i was no
 match for silvera in strength but
i could see by the terrible look in his
eyes that he meant to kill me and so as he
rushed toward me with his great hands out-
stretched to grasp my throat i picked up a
small stone and struck him square in the
face with it he stopped and clapped his
hands to his mouth while i backed away
he grabbed another piece of jagged rock and
advanced with the blood streaming from
his nose and his tangled beard streaked
white with crusted salt
  ill fix you my bully he roared you
think youve finished my hash-
  i leaped behind a huge sea-bleached
stone just as he hurled his missile and
while he stooped to pick up another i
pelted him with all my strength with an-
other small piece of rock it struck him on
the cheek cutting it to the bone and wrhile
i grabbed two more he drove a chunk
smack into my ribs with terrific force i
gasped and hurled both my missiles at him
one missed but the other bowled him over
following up my advantage i grasped a
large stone and launched it at his head it
struck him square in the middle of the back
as he rolled over and he collapsed with a
growl of rage
  several times he attempted to rise to his
feet but somehow or other he was powerless
while i waited with another stone poised to
brain him with as soon as he gained his
knees he gave an agonized cry more like
that of a wild beast than of a human being
and shrieked
  kill me kill me my back is broken
  and as i watched him groveling on the
pebbles and clawing out with his hands in a
vain effort to rise i saw that this evidently
was the case my missile had caught him
in the small of the back just as he was jump-
ing to his feet and the blow had broken
his spine
   i stepped up to him still holding on to my
stone he snarled at me like a trapped wolf
his face dripped blood and with his matted
hair tangled beard and the eyes literally
ablaze with hate and savage defiance he
made a frightful picture as he lay on the
gravel with his fingers tearing into the peb-
bles in his helpless rage
gjg captain silvera i said
inmi calmly you and i arc quits now
       youve got to make your peace with
god for the lives you have sent into eternity
for greed of gold youre a dying man
  dyin be cussed he shrieked oh
blast you dixon its you that has done
all this its you that piled th vessel
  yes i answered i piled her up and
i did it purposely-
  you did
  he snapped the question out doubtfully
aye i did i fixed your compass told
you to crack on and theres the result
  and i pointed to the hulk king a cables
length belowr in the spume and froth of the
breakers
  what-made you do that he said after a
pause a little more calmly i always
treated you well
  yes i replied and i was to navigate
the bark to hiva nuku and then youd toss
me to the sharks it was my skill as a
navigator which saved me thats all youd
have hove me over the side off nantucket
shoals if joe smith hadnt told you i had
been an officer i owe you nothing
  he remained quiet for a spell and the
savage light died out of his eyes
  what do you know he inquired at
length
  i know that you and your crew were
nothing more than pirates pretending to be
whalers i answered i know that you
looted and sunk two ships murdering their
crews i wasnt drugged the time the sea
king was looted i did not drink the water
until after the crime wtas committed
  he nodded
  dye think ill die
  youll die ultimately i replied without
emotion we may both die but oull
die first a broken back wont kill you
right away but starvation will get you very
soon
  and as i shot a glance behind me i saw
the tide was on the turn

adventure
  ill have to leave you i said will
 haul you up the beach
  no he growled let me be
  will you have a biscuit
  no save it for yourself youll need it
soon enough
   was about to say good-by to him when
he spoke
  wait a spell dixon im go in t slip
my shackle soon but i might as well give
you a true bill stand by for a minute or so
an ill get all hands into the tar-pot will
ye hear me
  i nodded and sat down on a boulder
alongside him it was raining and bitterly
cold the wind was howling in the fissures
slaty storm-racked sky gray sea and gray
cliffs fringed with roaring breakers made
up a melancholy vista of desolation and
misery add to the picture of dreary land
and sea the battered hulk in the surf the
scattered bodies the two living creatures-
one helpless and doomed already and the
other with but a doubtful span of life before
him-and the weird and mournful squawk
of the penguins in the fissures and you have
an idea of the depressive background in
which i listened to silveras confession
chapter x
silvera unbosoms himself
tf you get clear dixon ill have you
- make a report on what i m goin to say
go to th nearest yankee consul an tell
him th whole yarn ill bet itll raise his
hair some now if youll listen ill spin you
th story
  ive been most kinds of a sailor in my
day-privateerin slavin an running th
slave embargo then i went my last two
or three voyages whalin as boat-steerer an
harpooneer in t me and our cooper
a man called jake thompson jumped the
ship in new zealand an sundowned it
for the otago gold diggins we struck it
rich sold out for fifty thousand dollars
apiece and went to san francisco with our
pile
  thompson started a kind of tradin ven-
ture among the islands and i came east an
did some gun-runnin in a schooner round
th gulf ports i lost a good deal o my dol-
lars at that game an lost th schooner as
well so i went west again and found
thompson in frisco doin a roarin busi-
ness with his tradin company then i
broached my scheme to him
  they were raakin big strikes in th
bendigo an ballarat gold fields of aus-
tralia an miners were cornin over to
frisco with stories of th gold that was
bein shipped out o th country in th clip-
pers round th horn this give me an
idea an i reckoned if a man had a fast
sailin packet an a crew he could rely on
there wouldnt be much difficulty in piratin
a few o them gold ships
  we talked th thing over an we decided
that th best kind o craft to use for th
business would be a whaler whaleships
have a kind o rovin commission they kin
go anywhere an cruise aroun without
causin suspicion ye kin carry a pile o
boats an keep steady masthead lookouts
an your papers allow you to enter any port
  havin both been whalemen we de-
cided that a whaler would be th best kind o
craft to use a schooner would be too
small an liable to be overhauled by th
first gunboat what seen her cruisin around
an a marchant vessel would be more sus-
picious than anythin so th wjialer was la
best lay
now as it wasnt an easy job
pickin out th craft what carried th
dust we had t figure out -me plan
for knowin likely vessels as i didnt calcu-
late on stoppin an overhaulin every aus-
traliaman we met you must remember
that every ship we stopped would have to
be got rid of or theyd be for reportin our
actions to th first cruiser they met an wed
be done for so rememberin this we
picked up four likely fellows an let them
into our plans and we fixed things up in
this way
  i was to go east an buy an fit out a
likely craft for a whalin voyage thomp-
son supplied th rhino for th scheme th
four men who were in th game with us
were to make for melbun an hang aroun
there until they heard of a ship leavin for
england with a consignment o gold an
they were to sign on as foremast hands
aboard of her we reckoned that two pack-
ets with a bunch o homeward-bound miners
an their dust would about do us th two
men who signed on in each ship were to get
into each watch port an starboard so s
to be able to keep an eye open for us all th
time
the whaler

  sailormen were scarce enough in mel-
bun with th crews cuttin stick for th
diggins an we knew theyd have no trou-
ble in shippin themselves we were to be
cruisin about in th homeward track jest
west o th cape verde islands an theyd
arrange to signal us in some way or other
we fixed things pretty well an there wasnt
so much chance o mistakes as youd maybe
think
  i came east by the overland trail an
picked up the arcturus in savannah very
cheap an scrapin up a crew i had her
brought to noo bedford an altered for
whalin then i got a parrott rifie-gun an
fixed boards over it to make it look like a
tank or bosuns locker-
  how did you allay suspicions around
new bedford when you fetched that gun
aboard
  no suspicions at all a lot o whale-
ships carried cannon for protection against
pirates in the eastern channels an nobody
thought anythin about it i sounded my
crowd what i had scraped together an made
sure theyd be ready for anythin
  then i picked up a feller named lam-
son for first mate an navigator i was no
navigator myself an for th business we
needed a good man this lamson was a
clever joker but when i broached my plans
he tried to escape while we were anchored
out in th bay an i brained him with a
handspike-
  i thought you said he was drunk and
fell down the companionway
   aye i told you that but i told you a lot
o things no he wasnt drunk but i hit
him too hard an he croaked i had to
get away to sea after that as th feller be-
longed to noo bedford an i was afraid some
of his friends might be cornin out to visit
him afore we sailed i got outside an
cruised around intendin for to send a boat
in to shore next momin to get hold of an-
other mate an while i was standin off
an on your ship most cut us down an you
fell aboard lucky for both of us you
were jest th man i needed ef you werent
 d have had you over th side long afore
now i reckon you know th rest o th
yarn pretty well-
  tell me i interrupted what were
you going to do if the vessels had dassed
you in the night
  he smiled contemptuously
  i arranged for that aj th time we were
on th cruisin ground i had a red an white
lantern hangin under th bowsprit an
ever vessel we saw we gave chase to we
only saw two craft at night anyhow
  i nodded
  finish your story
waal there aint much more we
picked up the albemarle an got th
signal from our fellows aboard
then i hocused you out o the way an
looted her an sent her to th bottom we
got most two hundred an fifty thousand
pounds o dust an raw gold out o her you
knew nawthin about that
  then we picked up the other fellow on
th sea king-his partner was killed off
the horn-an you say you saw that bit o
work we got a big pile out o her-most
as much as the other thats about all i
reckon cept that we were to he in to hiva
nuku until a schooner arrived an took th
stuff to frisco we were to follow later an
divide up on th spoil-
  the crewr as well
  he gave a wty smile
  some o them only i would lose a few
between the islands an th golden gate
sickness yknowt forces me to give up th
vyge
  i looked down on him with abhorrence
youre a pretty dirty scoundrel i said
but i thank the lord ive fetched you and
your gang up all standing ive been a fool
but i wasnt so foolish as you thought i was
and two can play at a game of bluff how-
ever its all finished now and i wish you no
harm pray if you know how for ive got
to be moving
  he laughed harshly
  pray huh im no crawler h theres
such a place as hell then im bound for it
an therell be plenty to hail me when i get
there but well all go th same road re-
member jake thompson san francisco
ef you get clear go to a consul an swear
to what ive told you i want him to swing
will you do what i say
   if i get clear i will
  i was rising to move away when he cried
appealingly
  say dixon im a goner i know but
dont leave me to starve ill jest ask you
one thing an i hope yell do it knock my
brains out an put me out o misery--
  no no no i cried shuddering with the
hideousness of the suggestion
	adventure
  then strangle me kill me in some way
god man dont leave me here to perish
alone
  sick with cold and the horror of the
tilings i had seen and heard i staggered up
against the rock wall with his entreaties
ringing in my ears
  come on dison  ike a good fellow fix
me somehow but dont leave me for gods
sake heave me in tli surf drown ins
easy
  i steeled my nerves and rushed toward
him
  god forgive me i murmured and i
dragged and lugged him down to the edge
of the advancing breakers
  out to th ledge there an topple me in
he commanded
  obeying his commands i pulled him over
the kelp-covered rocks to the edge of the
ledge then for a moment my resolution
wavered
  over with me man he roared over
with me it will be a mercy
  i stood back in terror
  i cant i cant i wailed
  his hands clawed at the wteeds and he
dragged himself to the brink
  so long he shouted and as i stared at
him in paralyzed fright he rolled into the
churning sea
chapter xi
i change my vocation
how i scaled the cliffs i do not know
but when i came to my natural mind
again i was stumbling through the tussock
grass and causing an uproar among the pen-
guins boobies and other sea fowl nesting
in the coarse vegetation i wandered
around for many hours until i stumbled
upon a rude hut constructed out of wreck-
age and sail cloth here i lived for days
subsisting upon raw eggs and the biscuits
i had brought with me until i was picked
up by a small falkland islands schooner
beach-combing around the coast for wreck-
age
  i told them of the wrecked whaler but
nothing of the gold in her lazaretto nor the
circumstances which led to my being cast
ashore on staten land they cruised in
the direction of the place where she was ly-
ing but not a vestige of her fabric remained
though pieces of her hull and spars were
seen in the clefts and ledges
  after being landed at port stanley i made
my way over to montevideo and reported
the affair to the united states consul
that gentleman promptly had me arrested
and confined as a lunatic i was released
and went to bueuos ayres and the consuls
both british and american listened to my
tale with incredulous wonder and quickly
had me thrown out into the street not a
soul would believe me and the newspapers
published an account of a crazy sailor
whose mind had been upset by reading of
the disappearance of two homeward-bound
australian clippers
  eventually i joined a ship lxund for
frisco upon arrival i saw the authorities
and told tjiem of the connection of one
jake thompson with the affair thomp-
sons trading company had gone u
business a few months before arid thomp-
son himself was no longer in tlfe city i
was laughed at and discredited wherever i
went the affair was a standing joke in the
newspapers for many weeks they wil-
lingly believed that i was one of the tu-
rnss crew they believed the peculiar man-
ner in which i had come to be aboard of her
but the rest of my tale was put down to
a disorder of the brain induced by the hard-
ships i had undergone
  rebuffed laughed at and jeered on every
hand i soon came to the conclusion that
the less i said about the events the better
for me and my future prospects  left the
city and went inland gold prospecting with
a determination never to go seafaring again
i kept my word and the foregoing account
written some forty years after the affair
happened is the only statement  have
made since i shook the dust of frisco from
my feet
  i am a very old man now but the lord
has kept my memory green and though i
often desire to forget nevertheless the
horror of those far-off days is still in my
mind
it might
havb
happened
otherwise

author of the chelsea vase the crimson track elc
he growth of the thing in his
mind had been gradual when
it had obtruded upon his con-
sciousness at first he had drawn
back in mingled fear and anger by de-
grees however he tolerated the thought
only always at a distance and concluded
by allowing it to make a rendezvous of his
idle meditations receiving it much as one
might welcome an unwholesome but highly
fascinating acquaintance all the time he
knew its real name was theft
  for three years parsly had served as sta-
tion agent and telegraph-operator at the
junction each day he had observed the
transient bustling by the long platform
the spectacle never varying long vesti-
buled trains halted impatiently and always
the same curious or apathetic faces peered
out at him from the fullmans
  it was the branch line tapping the lum-
ber country that contributed humanism
consisting of a nodding acquaintance with
timber operators and forlorn commercial
travelers the first were always in a hurry
to make the big city connection the latter
lingered in his company for the sake of gain-
ing an audience while they cursed the
country
  the last because the junction was not the
liveliest place in the world to put in an
hour or two of waiting situated where the
engineering problem had been the simplest
it was surrounded by blueberry plains
dotted at intervals with scrub pine as the
locomotives annually set the pines afire
the immediate foreground continuously
presented a dead charred appearance
far-off the objective point of the pullmans
loomed the cool silhouettes of mountains
guardians of inland lakes and famous fish-
ing
  more than once parsly compared him-
self with robinson crusoe in his isolation
only he had no man friday to enliven his
dull routine he saw much of the passing
world but was never of it thus at the end
of three years the hurrying by of the heavy
trains aroused a species of resentment
every one was at liberty to take flight but
him then again fifty dollars a month for
his combined duties was hardly a com-
pensating solace
  it was the matter of salary that caused
the idea to germinate while he was sullenly
working the semaphore one day he had
just received from the night branch some
four hundred dollars express money which
he must deliver to the agent on the morning
rity-passenger having just received his
monthly wages he could not help but con-
trast its meager total with the bulking roll
in his hip-pocket
  if he had four hundred dollars all his
own he would throw up the job and use it
in one delicious round of travel by the
time it was exhausted he could obtain an-
other position in a pleasing environment
in logical sequence he decided he might as
well allow his imagination a wider range
and play at taking a vacation with the
largest sum ever entrusted to his care for a
single night he remembered this to be an
even thousand dollars sent down by a big

adventure
operator in payment for horses in the lum-
ber camps
  a thousand dollars offered his fancy
vastly more possibilities to work with the
four hundred became insignificant as his
duties permitted him much time for reflec-
tion he carried the thought back to his
dingy office and entertained it by consulting
maps in the railroad folders in this fashion
he took a hurried excursion across the con-
tinent and spied out the land then he
became critical and weighed and balanced
different localities
  the southwest free from cold gray au-
tumnal rains howling snows and spring
inundations finally appealed to him as be-
ing ideal of course there might be two
thousand dollars entrusted to him any night
especially now that it was autumn and the
lumbermen were stocking up for the winter
campaign
  it was at that precise point that his
cheek reddened and he felt a touch of
alarm as he angrily told himself such
imagining was immoral for it was based
on the suggestion that he steal the money
he condemned the suggestion wrathfully
as he walked a quarter of a mile to the
lonely home where he boarded and yet
he was more downcast than ever over
his colorless place in life
  on returning to the station to close up
for the night which meant a weary wait for
the up-passenger to pull in he returned to
the suggestion abruptly and recklessly it
wtas the sight of the porters making up the
berths the comradeship in the smoking
compartment that plunged him into full
revolt only now he proceeded on the theory
the money was legitimately his
  well i guess ive earned it what if i
should take it providing i could get away
with it how would i spend it
  this surrender eased him much of
course he wouldnt take it not a penny
but its impossible lo picture a career of
spending until the imagination has logically
furnished the requisite possession now
he had mentally satisfied his imagination
as to possession although the technique
was illegal fortunately there is no law
punishing a man for inwardly discussing the
possible assets of a crime
  of course parsly merely intended to pur-
sue his day-dreams unhampered by any
irritating self-criticism he had systematic-
ally arranged his data and could spend a
million a day should he choose that was
where he erred his imagination became a
hard taskmaster very exacting once he
accepted the suggestion that the money
was to come to him through theft his
methodical mind insisted on reviewing the
possibilities of detection before permitting
him to enjoy the fruits
  wouldnt you be caught and arrested
before you could make a beginning was
the cautious query he was forced to put to
himself
  such nagging is very annoying and to
satisfy his mysterious pu rrhonist and con-
tinue with his spanish architecture he set
himself about planning how the trick could
be done without his being detected
  this was a hopeless morass at first and
very unpleasant for instead of picturing
innocent expenditures he found himself
sweating and struggling with the problem
of how he could keep the money once he
secured it the more he labored the more
nimble became his other self in raising perti-
nent objections exploding seemingly sound
theories and ridiculing his most astute
hypotheses
  to merely appropriate the money and
disappear was quickly shown to be the
height of idiocy that spelled a life of
slinking and fear the flying from phannms
it ttook some thought to clear the fore-
ground of discarded theories and plans and
approach the realm of finesse but at last he
seemed to be building on a firmer founda-
tion
  probably the frequent raids by veggmen
on rural post-offices and isolated railroad
stations stimulated this office of his imagina-
tion for in reading the paper presented
him gratis each evening by the newsboy on
the up-passeuger he noted the veggmen
always securely tied whoever stood between
them and loot cut the tell-tale wires and
cscaped
  then came the great idea and slapping
the paper he glanced apprehensively around
the small office and whispered
  if i faked a holdup the yeggs would get
the credit and id get the dough it would
be a cinch if a man wanted to play
crooked
  stay was it so easy the various
precautions necessary for counterfeiting a
robbery each simple in itself quickly
loomed into mountains then he decided
on just how the furniture should be broken
it might have happened otherwise

and overturned to approximate realism
just when the wires should be cut whether
the station door should be left open or
closed and the condition of his clothing and
pockets as there was no safe in the office
the agent carried the moneys upon his per-
son at first he imagined his pockets
turned inside out then repudiated the
thought as being too clumsy
  but what about the tying-up portion of
the programme could a man tie himself
so as to convince his rescuers that his pre-
dicament was genuine of course there was
a chance rather a good one too of his land-
lord foreman of the section crew coming
to his aid and cutting the cords without
making any particular observations still
only perfection of detail would satisfy his
exacting critic
  now parsly if slow of thought at times
was dogged in his persistence once he grap-
pled with a problem he now gave his
spare time to studying ropes and knots
  the newspapers had charged up the vari-
ous robberies to fresno red and his gang
and had dwelt at length on the method
used in each case in tying up watchman or
agent invariably one end of the rope was
made fast about the feet and ankles of the
captive then passed up and around the
waist the hands being caught and tied be-
hind the back the loose end finally being
made fast about the captives neck in a slip-
noose
  it was done very quickly each victim had
averred and so hampered a man that the
more he struggled the more he endangered
his life by self-strangulation it was a
method worthy of the redoubtable fresno
red and one parsly now attacked to satisfy
his insistence on correct detail
that night he surreptitiously car-
ried a piece of new rope home he
had already discovered that new
rope would not slip like old smoothly worn
rope in the secrecy of his small chamber
he essayed the simple task of tying his own
feet his heart beat rapidly as he pulled
the knot tight then he laughed vacuously
and told himself it was all a game it ended
where it began merely a pastime he did
not attempt to duplicate the veggmens
knots further that night
  he would not concede that he stood in
fear of the trooping suggestions now be-
setting hm and eagerly offering aid yet
he fought hard to put the thoughts from his
mind during the morning hours and felt
extremely virtuous as he handed the down
agent the customary parcel of money
  that night he relaxed and deftly tied his
feet passed the line about his waist and
clumsily wound it around his wrists he
remained awake more than an hour trying
to solve the rest of the problem-how to
fasten the rope about his wrists so it would
be impossible to free himself and then
secure the end about his neck he decided
it couldnt be done and fell asleep
  toward morning when but half awake
he heard a voice adwse-
  tie the rope first about the neck
  he popped up to a sitting posture and
stared wildly about the dark chamber he
knew it was a suggestion from his inner
self yet so distinctly did he hear the words
it seemed as if they must have been voiced
aloud throughout the early morning he
brooded over the suggestion at first he
could not discern any sense in it subcon-
sciously however he had often noticed the
lumbermans trick of using a clove-hitch-
two half-hitches-and gradually the recol-
lection thrust itself above the threshold of
consciousness he believed he had succeeded
  he must make the rope fast about his
neck while standing then secure it about
his ankles with practically no slack con-
tinuing the loose end to his waist and tying
it talung care to have it pass outside the
rope running from neck to heels then by
throwing back his head and heels he would
obtain enough slack to make the two
double loops or half - hitches through
which he could work his wrists
  the last operation he realized would
demand great care as he must thrust his
hands in from opposite direcions until wrist
overlapped wrist if it would work he
would dismiss the matter and resume the
pleasing visions of spending the money
  the mornings paper contained a glaring
account of a daring yegg robbery at the
centerville station the agent had been
trussed up and some fifteen hundred dollars
taken
  those guvs certainly got the nerve
commented the newsboy as the agent was
reading the item didnt even gag
roberts just corded him up like a bale
of hay copped his roll and beat it roberts
is so scared hes working his notice
  that afternoon parsly was curious to
m
adventure
examine all baggage fastened with ropes
several parcels of sample dowels sent by
express from the up-country mill held his
attention the closest they were tied with
new rope and the clove-hitch held tightly
even when he worked an end loose just
before he closed up for supper the branch
train brought in a hundred-odd dollars but
the agent confidentially assured
  tomorreru be a record breaker two
parties i know of are going to send down a
thousand per together with the other
money youll have close to three thousand
bones to nurse over night the danged
company ought to put a safe in your
office
  off duty for the night he hastened to his
room where the supreme test awaited him
if he succeeded there was nothing to pre-
vent a man from robbing himself and leav-
ing no clues when from the open door he
could catch the sound of his landlords
heavy regular breathing he removed his
shoes seated himself on the edge of the bed
and began experimenting with the cord
  he fastened the noose about his neck and
stood up and noted where the rope in a
direct line touched the floor then seating
himself he tied it tightly about his ankles
and brought the loose end up to and around
his waist there was scarcely any slack
when he straightened out his legs at first
he feared he had drawn the cord too tight
and anxiously turning on his face threw
back his head and heels
  with a thrill of elation he found the slack
would enable him by an effort to form the
hitch after a moments fumbling he suc-
ceeded and even wriggled his hands through
the loops until the tips of the fingers rested
on the upper forearm it wearied him and
with a sigh of physical relief he extended
his legs
  in an instant his tongue felt too large for
his mouth and with a gasp of horror he de-
cided he was choking to death he did not
lose his nerve as he remembered the remedy
and he drew back his legs but although
this gave a bit of slack to the rope he could
not induce the hitch to loosen from the
satisfaction of having proven his theory he
quickly glided into the fear that he had cal-
culated too nicely
  had the rope been old and smooth or had
his hands been imprisoned palm to palm
finger tip to finger tip he might have secured
a leverage and by working them apart have
succeeded in wrenching one free but the
new rope refused to give and for a minute
he lay quiet panting for breath and taking
great care to bring no strain on his neck
  down-stairs the old clock was ponder-
ously ticking off the seconds and he re-
mained a prisoner his heart chilled as he
feared he must summon the foreman to
come to his rescue but how could he
explain his peculiar plight what suspi-
cions might not his predicament arouse
  this dread quickly gave way before one
more chance the noose seemed to be tight-
ening about his neck and he remembered
the foreman was a heavy sleeper his wife
occupied a room with her small children at
the other end of the house he doubted his
ability to call help if he did not he might
slowly strangle to death
  already the cold sweat was trickling into
his eyes and it required a mighty effort
of the will to restrain himself from thrashing
about he knew however that the mo-
ment he lost control of his nerves and moved
incautiously his wind would be shu off
gritting his teeth he drew his heels far back
like an acrobat he was lying face down
with the bedclothes half smothering him
then he gently picked at the rope with his
finger tips useless the cords held his
wrists like bands of iron
  finally he managed to work the cord
between the fingers of his left hand and
exert a pressure upward hoping to loosen
the hitch his essay was barren of results
for some moments and it was not until he
was about to collapse that he felt his right
hand moving more freely with an in-
articulate cry of triumph he wrenched his
wrist smartly and instantly felt the cord
renew its grip like a sentient thing it was
like a cat playing with a mouse
  breathing in dry sobs he slowly sought to
recover the lost ground and persevered
until he again was pushing upward on the
cord for the second time he felt the right
hand move a bit this time he worked it
back and forth most gently and at last man-
aged to pull it free even then it required
some minutes to remove the rope from his
throat
  - the thing he choked sinking
back exhausted it nearly got me
  that night he dreamed of the money
brought in by the branch train only there
were cars and cars loaded with it and it
was all in gold and men were removing it
it might have happened otherwise

with huge scoops just as they shovel out
yellow corn
  by morning he had regained his normal
tone and even felt inclined to laugh at him-
self after all had he not done what he
set out to accomplish-to prove a man
could effectually make himself a prisoner
had he been engaged in a bona fide robbery
he would not have attempted to free him-
self his success in escaping detection
would be his utter inability to do so in
that case of course he would expect to en-
dure the torture till help reached him
  what odds if a man suffered a few hours
of physical agony if it resulted in supply-
ing him with several thousand dollars he
now clearly appreciated that had his experi-
ment been less successful he would have
been grievously disappointed the problem
would have remained an obstacle to his
imagination and his dangerous although
alluring fancies needs must be postponed
on the whole he felt rather proud of his
achievement
all day the great idea kept
pounding through his head he
had it in his power to obtain more
than two thousand possibly three thousand
dollars without being suspected his tem-
ples throbbed and ached as the thought as-
sailed him once or twice during the after-
noon he was called to the baggage-room to
check a trunk each time his gaze involun-
tarily sought the coil of new rope hanging
behind the door
  it was well known to students of crime
that veggmen pick up their tools on the
premises of the place robbed traveling un-
hampered by the burglars usual outfit
how natural that they should appropriate a
piece of this very cord to bind him with
that would necessitate the shattering of the
lock but the door was old and weak and a
well-delivered kick would smash it loose
he had no appetite for supper and heard
but little of the foremans gossip
  i was saying id like to play you a game
of crib tonight if you feel in trim repeated
the foreman
  crib oh of course sure danny
ill play crib ill be home right after the
up-train pulls out ill be home in good
season eagerly promised parsly suddenly
realizing the foreman might get impatient
at waiting might take alarm at his board-
er s failure to reach home and go in search
of him that would eliminate long slov-
hours of torture on the office floor
  yes ill be home right after the nine-
oclock goes up he said i wont keep
you waiting
  while returning through the woods it
suddenly came home to him that he had
planned to steal the money for a mo-
ment he felt strongly moved and made a
feeble pretense of denying the accusation
then with a drawn face he muttered
  - it why sidestep its been in
my nut for days ill never get another
chance like this-so much dough and the
yeggs near
  he sought to distract his mind by bitterly
assailing the railroad and express com-
panies and assuring himself the thought
would never have occurred to him had he
been paid something beyond a starvation
wage for a fourteen-hour day it really
wasnt robbery laws were made by men
it was reprisal when it came to the ethic
of it-only parsly didnt know what the
word meant-hed earned the money at
least a part of it
  the night connived at his purpose blow-
ing up cold and desolate and on the verge
of a storm by the time the branch pulled
in the platform was streaming rivulets from
the heavy downpour and the express agent
made the office on the run
  heres the stuff he yelped tossing a
package on the table nothing to hold
us and were going right back so long
  parslv breathed more freely sometimes
a mixup over freight or a hot-box kept the
train with the men careless of the passing
minutes as they had no schedule to make
on the return run to waverlv the first
station where they would hold the siding
for the night
  outside the rain was falling with a thun-
derous clamor smearing the window panes
till it was impossible to make out the
switch-lights directly in front of the station
parsly rose his eyes glittering the money
must be concealed safely till the morrow
  he had never read poes story of the pur-
loined letter yet instinct urged a simple
hiding-place he decided on the greasy can-
vas coat hung back of the door he wore
it only when cleaning the -witch-iamps
the packge fitted nicely into one capa-
cious pocket no one would ever find it
there now to arrange the stage settings
the overturned furniture the open door-
adventure
 the door opened four men were
crowding in through the miniature water-
fall released from the loaded eaves parsly
eyed them as one entranced his gaze frozen
with horror it was no physical fear he
dreaded but for the moment it seemed as
if his evil purpose had escaped him and now
stood crystallizedfcinto tangible shapes each
a unit of wickedness
  nail the mutt sharply ordered the
leader a man with a heavy shock of red
hair
  one of the men twisted parslys arm
behind him and thrust an iron wrist under
his chin two others stood near one hold-
ing a revolver the other caressing a life-
preserver the leader was glancing about
the office
  all this occurred in a single motion yet
it seemed to cover ages to the stupefied
agent it was the red-headed mans
prowling gaze that brought parsly to his
senses they were veggmen-fresno red
and his gang they were after the money
and the leader was seeking the safe
  the man who had seized the agent was
deciding he had never in ail of his strong-arm
jobs encountered so thoroughly frightened a
victim as now when parslys chin hugged
in and his strong teeth bit deeply into his
captors wtist causing him to scream with
pain at the same instant the agents long
leg kicked out overturning the table and
the one lamp
  the room was plunged in darkness and
the man with the revolver discharged his
weapon evoking a shriek of mortal agony
but not from the agent fresno red called
loudly for a light while he attempted to
strike a match parsly had the advantage
he knew one of the robbers was dead or seri-
ously wounded and while every man was
his enemy in the darkness the yeggmen
feared to injure a pal
  block the door and window roared
fresno red
  during this brief leeway parslys groping
hands found the office stool and he swung
it around his head in a deadly circle by
the sickening crunch he knew at least one of
the enemy was off the active list then a
match flared up for a second and the leaders
revolver exploded the agent experiencing a
stinging sensation in the side
  for an instant parsly felt strangely numb
then the stool rose like a llail and the man
with the life-preserver sank to the floor
  somehow the agent now felt a riotous
elation fear was a very distant emotion
his veins were filled with molten lead in-
stead of blood he breathed hate rather
than the smoky air it was a monstrous
thing that these murderers should seek to
rob his employers
  with a wild howl of rage he plunged into
the remaining two men kicking and smash-
ing like a maniac with the fragment of the
stool out through the door they poured
another of the gang falling with afractured
skull then parsly discovered he was alone
  he stood stupidly for a few moments
weaving back and forth he aroused him-
self as his dull ears caught a familiar sound
a hand-car was being pumped down the
grade his mind cleared to supernormal
lucidity he saw his advantage he had
been brutally attacked and seriously
wounded the one man escaping would be
charged with having stolen the money
they wrested it from him in the struggle
he had fought hard hed earned it and
yet should he pull the lever close by his
right hand he could throw open the switch
down the line and send fresno red crashing
into the empty coal-cars on the siding
  youll never get a better chance it
simply cant be known and-
  no he yelled springing to the lever
and pulling it back with his last ounce of
strength
 no-you no
  within the next minute he heard a dull
crash and knew the yegg leader had collided
with the coal-cars then he concluded the
wet platform would be an ideal place for a
red-hot body to rest on
      for the love of mike parsly
blgl down and out one man groaning
vlv and another dead in the office one
stiff out here good heavens exclaimed
the horrified foreman as he held up the lan-
tern he had come because parsly had
failed to keep liis promise as to the game
of cribbage
  as he read the full story in the four pros-
trate forms he collected his wits and dragged
parsly into the office meanwhile begging
him to wake up and get back his
nerve
  whats the row feebly asked parsly
then he remembered
  ive been shot find the instrument
and see if the wires are o k hold me up
chiquita of the legion

where i can reach it i must send in the
alarm the leader is down on the siding
somewhere i shunted him off into the
empties
  the desperate devils was going to make
sure panted the foreman as he hunted for
the instrument they fetched two coils
of rope
the papers made a great hero of
parsly fresno red who was
found with a broken shoulder gave
him a brave record for being game the
railroad sent a superintendent to tell him
he was in line for promotion and the express
company guardedly considered presenting
him with a reward
  i dont want any money growled
parsly as the agent sat by his bed in the
little house
  cut that out i did nothing but whats
in the days work but id like the center-
ville job roberts they say is going to
quit that pays a hundred a month
  he was appointed two days later only
now he hates the sight of coiled rope and
looks upon express money as so much
junk

donald
francij
mcgrew
author of the grenadier the guns of the seventy-thirdetc
i	j met the man first when be came
in with a batch of recruits for the
   	first regiment of the foreign
i-aj legion at sidi-bel-abbes algeria
the girl i had known for some time tie
was big young blonde the product of rich
american parents of this day and age she
was spanish youth and fire they called
her chiquita of the legion
  him being the only american with the
bleus-ittcrde his clothes were cut the way
they are cut along fifth avenue and it
gave me a gulp in the throat-i was tempted
to fall on his neck but he gave me a
slight chill at the outset-he wasnt used
to the soldiers method of self-introduction
   my god  i heard him groan under
us breath my god and his eyes
took in the surroundings
i read his thoughts he was sizinir up
the barracks of the legion-his home for
the next five years the big yard all
sprinkled with gravel and bare as the
prison parade at aden the monstrous un-
painted barracks looming up like so many
bams in the middle of a wyoming plain
the high thick walls like those that clamp
in the dead city of nire overhead a hot
african sun beating down from a glazed
blue sky-say it was a cheerful picture
three thousand ligtonnaircs in white fatigue
clothes couldnt enliven it-their faces had
soaked in something as listless as the voice
of the muezzin calling to prayer
  my god he muttered again five
years-
  youll get used to it was my cheering
comment whats your name now
and bowd you come to do it
  he started to turn away from me but i
caught him by the arm
  son i said we try to grin and bear

adventure
one another here especially countrymen
try to get into my company-the ninth-
and maybe i can help you out
  well he apologized then and after he
was assigned to my company i was able to
help him quite a bit but all through his
bath and drawing his clothes he acted
like a man in a sick dream answering me
only with short grunts and when he drew
his kit and stood there moping over that
pile of blue trousers blue tunics white
trousers and kepis not knowing which
strap was which i had to give him what-
for on the outside i would have dropped
him but he had good cigarettes and money
-which means wine in the legion
  buck up i said youre in for it
now here-heres how you make the
paquelage and this is the way you make
your bunk and heres what you put in your
knapsack youve got it to do-that or
prison so do it
  perforce he did buck up a little then but
when soup call came he stuck up his nose
at the thought of la gamclle we old
legionnaires were banging on the table with
our tins and yelling alles schieb i os a
la soupt soup el at the garde chambre-
that famous yeu of the legion-when he
hunches me and wants to know where we
can buy a good meal
  instanter my pan had gone to another
fellow and we were heading past the ser-
geant at the gate trust me to know where
i could get a good meal-after six months
in the legion
  ill take you to the cafe de la legion
i told him as we hurried through the yellow
sand of the streets and into the alley district
  he stuck up his nose with a wry face-
those spanish jews and arabs in the ghetto
district do smell bad-they and the filth
and the heavy sweet odor of musk and arab
cigarettes and he cast a longing look back
at the better streets
  youre not welcome back there i
grinned all ces malheurcux legionnaires
ill take you to chiquitas place-chiquita
of the legion
 chiquita he says that means
sweetheart in spanish dont it
  i nodded and he looked at me grinning
cynically
  the sweetheart of the legion he mur-
mured is she- 
  no i cut in she is not and i
added with some heat
shes the sweetest cleanest thing
sidi-bel-abbes the legion swears
her
in
by
  he whistled looking at me sideways and
begged pardon
  tell me about her he says then so i
told him about chiquita of the legion as
we walked through the alleys of sidi-bel-
abbes	
  she was a young spanish girl i toldjairn
who had been thrown on her own resources
when her daddy died mysterious after
some trouble with the algerian-french
government some way theyd taken his
vineyard so she gathered together a few
chairs and tables put up the shack which
she graced by the name of cafe de la
lsgion and started to sell coffee to the
foreign soldiers
  it wasnt such good coffee i pointed out
but it was cheap and somehow she had a
way of giving a friendly smile-even a co-
quettish smile-with each cup and still
retaining the respect of the	s
she was the only woman in sidi-bel-abbes
who deemed them worthy of being treated
on terms of equality and the legion did
not forget whenever the companies were
ordered against the arabs in the south
many knapsacks full of loot came back
across the hot sands to chiquita con-
sequently her walls were hung vrith purios
draped about among her drawings-oh be
would find hers an interesting place
  youll find her interesting too i added
only be careful she dont become too in-
teresting we all fall in love with her now
and then-but its of no use i think shes
in love with her drawings
  drawings he said real quick you
mean she does them herself
  yes i said crude pieces of work
but very good for one who has never bad
any instruction
  ha he exclaimed then this is
getting interesting an undiscovered gen-
ius perhaps with beauty-surely she has
beauty-who cooks your meals and does
a crayon of you-in the city of the foreign
legion tris bicn nton camarade-let us
hurry
  his eyes began to sparkle and his lips
to quirk at the corners and after wed taken
aboard some wine and arrived at last at
chiquitas hed begun to act like a real live-
young american whod never stuck up
his hand in the legion
chiquita of the legion

chiquita- remember how
she looked that night and how he
bowed to her in a sort of humorous
mocking way when i introduced him and
how her eyes sparkled when she laughed
and tossed her black head at him in return
they made a picture those two with us
red-trousered legionnaires in the back-
ground i shant soon forget it
  chiquita-she was a picture a little
colored masterpiece only she laughed at
you out of the canvas she was real
which is better than the result of a brush
for some reason she used to affect a moor-
ish costume without a veil-possibly be-
cause it was cooler-a sort of white-hemmed
blue overgarment that hung from her head
and over the shoulders to her ankles un-
derneath that was a shorter garment of
heavy purple which in turn covered baggy
trouserlets of yellow silk caught up and
fastened at the ankle it went well with
her olive cheeks and black eyes she was all
color and piquancy and life sitting up there
with her little slippers poised on the rungs
of her high stool
  riordan he saw it never fear and
she saw him which was natural enough
too there arent many big blond ameri-
cans come into the legion who show un-
mistakable earmarks of culture and ur-
banity and have blue eyes that sparkle
and red lips that curve besides voila
who made the world the way it is anyway
  this is excellently done he made a
beginning going over to one of the etchings
and this-the touch here is very very
good surely mademoiselle has been with
a master
  well did we have that meal we did
chiquita was indeed glad to serve us-she
told us so-and she did while the other
poor devils of legionnaires sat around and
envied us the taste of that meal stuck in
my memory
  but between mouthfuls i got riordans
story it was simple enough as was mine
i got a berth at bassorah on the persian
gulf as supercargo on the tramp wizard
out of seattle a little fight ashore at
oran tied me up with the french authori-
ties it was either jail or the legion
young riordan hed had a berth spending
the old mans money and dabbling in art
in france until the art of monte carlo
soaked him-that and some chit of a girl
instead of a bullet and a last sad note
he decided to become a soldier of fortune
  lord he sighed i couldnt see any-
thing but the governors face across the
pond then i got dreams-ye gods
dreams-
  of maybe bringing a commission home
to the old man through some glor-ee-yus
deed on distant battlefield i filled in
the pause for him and they commenced
opening up your eyes even at marseilles
dont mention it he grimaced lets
have wine-red wine-i still have a little
money at any rate well drink-well all
drink to the legion eh-senorita chi-
quita
  to the legion she laughed and i saw
her eying him covertly from her stool when
he turned away
  she sold no wines but for the first time
she allowed her legionnaires to send out for
it so we made merry until time to go to
barracks now and then when she wasnt
so busy she and riordan stepped around
to the pictures talking of lines and
backgrounds and tones and other
things alien to us then riordan got to sing-
ing songs and playing on chiquitas guitar
to an audience that by that time crammed
the place full chiquita did a roaring
business that night-what time she wasnt
laughing with riordan
  shes got real talent he told me on the
way home gad im quite interested
if she only had a chance in paris now or
florence-
  most likely she never will i comment-
ed
  no i guess not then he seemed to
dismiss the matter and started humming
a tune
  he didnt hum a tune in the morning
though he got his first dose of gymnas-
tiqne des blcus and it went as follows
awake just before six coffee in bed-
no breakfast then reveille sweep out from
under your bunk get ready and fall in for
drill neatly and completely uniformed and
equipped for drill-all in ten minutes
one button wrong meant barrack arrest
la cellule or the zephyrs according to the
temper of the sergeant then out to the
drill grounds and the command forrn z
les faisccaux sac a tcrrc lay down
your knapsacks and pile arms then
pas gymnasliqud en avanll marchs
yes thats all at the double-march
just that and nothing more a run that

adventure
is kept up on no breakfast for thirty-min-
ute stretches interspersed with boxing and
swedish gymnastics until first soup call at
ten oclock lungs bursting head split-
ting-nom ju ban dieu the legion it
has crumpled many a mans lungs like
paper
  at ten riordan dragged himself in and
threw himself on the bunk like a dead man
he kept twisting himself from side to side
with the agony of his pumping lungs his
face was gray and lined and old
  my god he groaned it killed one
man this morning-hemorrhage of the
lungs
  they figure they have plenty more i
told him
  but whats it for he demanded in a
wail
  to harden you so you can march
    run the corporal said run or die 
   sure march or die-cest la legion
   and whats for this afternoon
  for you  i said rudimentary in-
structions for me either a twenty-four-
kilometer march or corvcc cleaning the
sewers of the arab prison building a villa
for some fat levantine piling forage for the
native spahi cavalry for five centimes
a day
  my god he groaned and thats
what i graduate to when i get turned for
full duty
  he stared into space as i have seen con-
victs stare in the deaths row then turned
back to me
  do they ever fight he asked
  sometimes
  sometimes say-what is this legion
for
  for i said my son it is for france
it is for students of social conditions to talk
about-and do nothing it is for escaped
convicts it is for hungry men who sell
their souls for five centimes a day it is
for cheap colonization projects it is for
building roads and cities it is for the pro-
tection and filthy service of filthy arabs
and harping jews who spit on the men that
protect them it is for fools work or
die march or die fight and die-cest la
legion
  and if you buck-
  lla cellule the zephyrs or the prison
battalion	
  la cellulcl his face contorted into a
horrible grimace i went past the cells
thirty men in a room nine by twelve i
could smell them thirty feet away
  la gamelle went then and we broke off
he didnt turn up his nose at it this time
no he fell on it like a wolf
  and so his life as a legionnaire began
  lrom that time he was two distinct per-
sonalities-by day gloomy silent a ma-
chine coming to life only at night wine
red wine and the sympathy of chiquita-
he lived for the nights and so it seemed
did she hed sing songs and talk to her
about her pictures-oh one could see how
things were going if he happened to be
detained on guard her face would fall
  well one night the sergeant at the gate
sent me back to repolish my shoes and
riordan went on ahead it was then that
i saw with my own eyes how far things had
gone
  the sun was just setting when i left the
gate the big molten disk swung down
back of the hook in the nearby thessala
mountains and its slanting rays played
over the flat roofs of sidi-bel-abbes like
spears from a sea of gold i remember
how the place looked that evening and
when i reached the cafe de la legion those
two were alone in the dim interior they
didnt hear me and how could they
she was standing on tiptoe crushed against
his breast his lips on hers even th-- dim-
ness couldnt hide the light in her iaee i
could see her tremble from ankles to head
then her eyes closed-
  i coughed and they turned to me-she
red and sweet and confused she ran into
the kitchen while he and i bridged the
awkwardness over a liter of wine but 
told him a few things later
  said i
  youd best treat her right she isnt
merely chiquita-shes an ideal to these
men who have come to believe that theres
no more good in the world treat her
wrong and theyll tear you to pieces
  he merely shrugged with a remark about
handling his own affairs so i didnt mention
it again
  then one night some one stole the re-
mainder of his money from under his pillow
  that was the beginning of the end
perforce he had to stay at the barracks
more now as he had no money to hire his
washing and polishing done the only
time you get to do that in is after second
soup call in the evening hed never done
chiquita of the legion

a days work in his life and policing up
didnt come natural to him pretty soon he
got to getting into trouble with the non-
coms and finally they soaked him two days
cellule for a dirty kit
  he came out of there smelling to heaven
covered with vermin his eyes were two
grim black holes in a pasty ashen mask
  its the last straw he swore they
ran me around with a knapsack filled with
sand on my back god i can hear that
corporals a droit-droit-ill hear it in
my dreams im going
  got money i asked
  no
  then youre crazy without it youll
buck the desert starvation that will drive
you to spanish farmers who are only too
glad to give you up the arab gendarmes
who will turn you in for the prize-money
and arab tribes that will cut you up for
your clothes even if you pass them you
have to have papers at the ports unless
you can smuggle aboard why dont you
wait until you get money from home
  he wouldnt listen to the last he
seemed afraid of his daddy he only shook
his head muttering to himself then finally
took himself off to town
  ill find some way he swore
  he did too he came to me an hour
later in the canteen and took me off to one
side his face was beaming
  shes going to lend me the money he
said firing it all at me at once and get
me a suit of civilian clothes and-
  hold on i said leading him out of
there youll be giving this away you
come with me down to chiquitas-you
two kids will need tommy patten to keep
your heads cool
  she says shes going with me too he
blurted then
  wait until we get there before you tell
me any more i said then well
straighten out the plans
  well she confirmed what he had said
sitting there on his knee back in the lit-
tle cafe kitchen man she was happy-
glancing down at him and him looking up
now and then rather red as to face hers
the color came and went in her cheeks like
     it glw-lishts of the ranabas off
marsel-leroo and every now and then the
round arms would tighten round his neck
with a little spasmodic jerk and her red
lips touch all over his face in a hundred

little kisses all the while she prattled on
like a happy little kid thank the good
god she said she had saved enough to
meet this one time in her life she had not
imagined the good god would be so good
to her spain-the spain her father had
talked about-with dick and an inex-
pensive little villa-oh life had turned out
to be a wonderful thing
  at last though i had to cut in on her
and throw the cold water of common sense
on her outlook they were taking grave
chances they must take every possible
precaution against possible detection and
capture
  thats what i told her riordan broke
in eagerly she wants to go with me
they may put the two departures together
if we go as she suggests by carts to the
coast and then over to spain in a hired
fishing-smack it is best for me to take
chances on a steamer and have her follow
on another boat
  no she cried how do you know
what boats are in oran you would have
to leave there as soon as possible on the
first boat perhaps it would be one right
to france with no papers-no i will
not listen you could not cable for all
messages are censored here listen-
and she turned in appeal to me-see if
this is not the best plan
  she was to take his measure get his
clothes then leave the cafe in charge of a
girl friend she would then go into the
country on a visit to some trustworthy
friends of her fathers the arabs they
employed formerly worked for her family
and these could easily be induced to take
them via cart train to tjecamen near oran
on the coast- they would travel at night
with dick under cover in case they met a
patrol three days she would wait at her
friends so that there might be no con-
nection between the two departures then
he was to come her arab friends could
easily arrange with the fisherman at the
coast to take them to spain
  shes right i told riordan but
now-whats going to happen when you
get to spain
  she buried her face in his neck so quick
i could not see his eyes
  what but one thing he retorted
well be married then ill cable the
governor that im off to a new start hell
come across then im sure
adventure
  hm i said why dont you get
married here
  he looked out from behind her shoulder
pretty quickly at that
  whyl he exclaimed that would
expose us sure no one could help putting
the two departures together then find
one find the other
  i had to admit that he was right but on
the way home i put my hand on his arm
and stopped him
  that girl is risking her savings and
running chances of the prison battalion for
helping a legionnaire desert i said-for
you
  she wont have it any other way he
muttered
  no i said she wont shes that
kind the governor wont have any cause
to be ashamed of the kind of grandchildren
shes going to bring him-if she does
  i wish shed listen to coming on another
boat he muttered in a troubled tone
  shes got the best plan i said best
come on now and go to sleep
  the next morning we heard that chiquita
would be gone for a time from the cafe
we knew then the first move was on but
during the next three days riordan was so
fidgety i had to keep an eye on him for fear
hed forget some part of his uniform and
get thrown into cells again he fretted
himself about a possible slip here and a slip
there until he had me on the raw edge
myself
finally though the night came
and how he did polish and primp to
make sure of passing inspection at
the gate i had to warn him for fear his
very eagerness would warn the corporal of
our squad that something unusual was
afoot and had to shake him up again
when we got beyond the gate
  dont run i scolded stroll along
like i do ill lead you out all right
oh he said are you going beyond
the walls
  certainly
  but if they catch you-
  pouf two days barracks arrest for
stealing grapes you need me youre
too excited	j
  im afraid youll be caught he insisted
but i wouldnt listen
  so we made for the city walls by alley
routes slipped by a patrol and went up
and over and away through the vineyards
 couldnt hold him back then-he hit
up the legions double time and i had
to follow
  we made those two miles in no time
keeping in the shadows as much as possible
then we heard a swift rustling of soft gar-
ments and chiquita was in his arms
  i let her have him a minute but time was
precious i saw the shadowy carts and
arabs waiting near by i urged him to
hurry
  change quickly i told him and
bring back every piece of your uniform so
i can see that it finds its way to the quarter-
master if you get caught you dont want
to be tried for stealing your kit
  he slipped into the shadows and chi-
quita ran to me and clutched at my arm
i was so good to help-she would never
forget-surely the good god would not
allow him to be caught
  tut tut  said everything is going
to be all right i assured her that l was
confident they would make it all right
  that is what i told her-but i sfcant
soon forget standing there with i-hat ctrl
all atremble beside me it isnt any too
pleasant playing a sort of helpless iviter-
father to a young girl thats sincere  rd
true and good and playing a game for her
lover with all her possessions and freedom
at stake no it isnt so pleasant-es-
pecially when you feel all her fears and
anxieties and being a man and older and
wiser you see t lot more she hasnt guessed
at as yet she was that close to me-the
trembling of her hands-the faint sweet
odor that came from her hair-
  then after an age riordan appeared
she ran to meet him and then walked back
with him toward me
  my eyes were on him inspecting the
clothes werent any too good being second-
hand si ill they fi tted well enough as far
as i could see but i wasnt noticing that
as much as something that was making
itself felt in his manner-something that
chilled me and when he handed me his
uniform bundle with a remark about his
new shoes hurting his feet a strange silence
fell on us all-a silence that made me sick
at heart
  she too felt it she looked up at him
wide-eyed
  what is it she whispered
  chiquita he said and stopped his
chiquita of the legion

voice was strange and husky then-
i found the money in the clothes
  yes yes five hundred francs you
must handle the purse now
  but i want that you should take half
of it i-
  he paused then went on with a rush
  i have been thinking about this all
along it is not best that we go together
i can go on to one of the up-country stations
and then to oran by rail-oh ill make
it all right - ill cable you when i am
safe
  i remained silent i was not amazed
for i had been halfway expecting this but
i looked at her she stared at him in utter
unbelief-it was as if he had struck her a
blow
  never have i seen greater misery depicted
in a human face she had guessed the
truth at last there was at least some-
thing honest enmeshed in the bottom of
the boy his face and eyes were poor liars
even if his words did evade he had never
intended to take her with him
  dick she cried very low i can hear
it yet it had sadder notes than the wongo
lament of the women on leno-la-nee
  a great anger seized me then
  you cur i choked and was on him
like a wolf
  big he was but he stood no show with
me in that rage he went dowrn fighting
but with me on top my bayonet at his
throat
  then chiquita grabbed my arm
 no she screamed no would
you-
  no ill not kill him i said but ill
make him put on that uniform again and
go back to barracks and i tightened
my grip on his throat
  hm   yes haig and haig willard
four fingers   yes  
  well i expect youre wondering what
came next i didnt think shed want me
to hurt him-thats a womans way-but
i wasnt prepared for what followed
  let him up she said and her voice wras
that strange and quiet i did so in a sort of
trance i have heard the same tones in the
voices of priests when they give the abso-
lution
  he got up stiffly with a murderous look
at me but stood still-her voice held him
too so they remained she looking at him as
if she couldnt look enough then she spoke
  you do not know what love is she
told him some day you may learn i
will always love you no matter what you
do no- to me as i tried to speak-
you must let him go five years-for
him-in the legion nom du bon dieu
it would kill him no you must keep
the money-dick now please go
  yes thats what that little girl said to
him out there under the stars in that al-
gerian night a girl that was born in the
provinces and had never seen her native
spain a girl born near-beard of the
prophet-the foreign legion yes and
even in the temperate zone you get to think-
ing that all thats good and noble is pic-
tured on the stage
  as for him he mumbled something-he
couldnt talk-and stumbled off through
the darkness while she watched him still
and dry-eyed
  no she didnt break down if she did
she kept it from me
  ah one needs a drink remembering a
scene like that a little more ice willard
thanks   it sticks in the memory  
  well-it stuck in his memory too yes
he made it all right made it to florence
and the american colony quite a group
of artist friends he found and he cabled
his father who instead of sending him
money came a-footing on the next boat to
take care of that prodigal son wouldnt
trust him until hed seen him the boy
fessed up then and made a clean breast of
the whole affair
  then he wtote me
  no i wont tell you what he wrote he
sent me the money with which i later made
my getaway but i wont tell you what
he wrote i wouldnt want a man to tell
what t said if i penned him a letter straight
from the bottom of my heart like that boy
did doggoned if it didnt make me feel
almost as good as chiquita did when he
wrote to her
  yes he saw his mistake a little time
away from her had opened his eyes he
sent for her theyre up there now in a
villa daubing at pictures together those
two and the kid-

chapter i
watson hears his call
id you ever kill a man
  the question came quietly out
of a long silence the younger
man looked up quickly from the
crackling camp-fire his eyes searching his
partners grave face for an explanation of
the strangely dull note in his voice 
  no johnny i never killed a man
why
  johnny watson made no answer for a lit-
tle as he drew thoughtfully upon his pipe
the little drying mountain stream upon
which they had camped for the night went
singing on its way under the stars
  neither of the two men so much as stirred
until after the younger man had almost for-
gotten the abrupt question and was think-
ing upon the bed he had made of willow
branches when johnny watson took the
pipe from between his lips ran a brown
hand across the grizzled stub of his ragged
mustache and continued in the same ex-
pressionless monotone
  i have three of em one close to
thirty years ago dick a sailor he was
and a sailor of a sort i was too in those
days down where the south seas is used
to man-killing i had a little money a good
deal for a sailorman to have all at one
time sewed in a bit of canvas in my shirt
ben he had been drunk and was mean and
reckless or i guess he wouldnt v done it
-ben was a decent man after his fashion
  he come up behind with a knife i saw
his shadow and  give it to him across the
temple with a bit of scrap-iron laying on
the little pier pie died two days later
  one was twenty years gone now they
called him devine and he was the cr  k-
edest man that ever put on white mans
clothes it began with cards and ended
with him trying to do me on a mine he
knowed when  had caught him and pulled
his gun first he missed me about six
inches and we wasnt standing more than
seven feet apart   
  and one was something more than eight
years ago he was no account he mur-
dered old tom richards tom was a pard-
ncr of mine toms body wasnt cold yet
when the man as murdered him went to
plead his case with the great judge
  again the deep stillness of the mountains
shut in about them young dick farley
stared curiously into his partners face
wondering and since the ways of the cities
of the earth were not forgotten by him the
ways of men where judges and courts and
written laws were not were new to him-be
shivered slightly
  for two years he and the man who was
speaking quietly of the murderous killing
of men and the killing of men in retribution
had lived together in that close fraternity
for which the west has coined the word
pardncrship from a colder word and

never had he heard old johnny watson
talk as he did tonight and still he
waited for the man to go on knowing that
there was some reason for this unasked con-
fidence
  theres some things a man can explain
went on watson theres a lords sight
more he cant when youve lived as long
as i have dickie alone a big three-fourths
of the time maybe youll be like me and
not try to look under things for the why
so longs you know the what
  i know now you and me are on the like-
liest trail i ever put one foot down in front
of the other on and i know its my last
trail its so long for you and me pard-
ner and im going to know real soon
whats on the other side of things
  dick farley sought a light rejoinder with
which to meet an old miners superstition
but he could find no words so again there
was silence between them until watson
once more spoke
  i killed them three men in fair fight
dickie and with the right o things on my
side and it aint ever once bothered me
and now the funny part of it-i aint so
much as thought of one of them men for a
month
  you know we got too much to think
about you and me with the trail leading us
straight to more gold-our gold-than
would sink a battle-ship and today well
when the sun shines in ray eyes and i wake
up slow im kinder dazed for a little while
and while i cant get my bearings im back
in the south sea country with ben the
sailorman just as plain as im seeing you
now dick i saw him twisted thumb and
all-and i hadnt thought about that
twisted thumb from that day over thirty
years ago until this very morning and
all day ive been walking first with ben
and then with flash devine and then with
perry parker as did for poor old tom
richards
      he broke off suddenly sitting
lurched forward his eyes medita-
tively upon the fire then he con-
tinued
  a man that didnt know would think it
was all nonsense but most men that live in
the way-out places of the earth and whove
took men off fair and square-or with a
knife from behind it makes no difference-
would know what i know i dont know
the why pardner and i dont care why
youll be looking for a new side-kick before
summer dies
  dick stirred uneasily again he sought
for a light bantering reply but the words
did not come a strange sense of fatality
had crept slowly over him
  he tried to tell himself that he was listen-
ing to the expression of an old miners
superstition that the thing was an absurd-
ity and while he refused to give credence
to a thing which he could not understand
he had an odd sense that he and johnny
watson were not alone unconsciously he
drew a bit closer to the fire and to the man
who was seeing things
  and this here the likeliest trail i ever
set foot down on said the older man
with nothing but a vague regret in the
even tones just two more days and
were there-maybe together and may-
be you finish the trail alone pardner
its a month ago i picked up that first big
yellow lump the whole mountainside is
rotten with gold and then i come back
and picked you up like wed said we would
you wearing your shoes out on flinty rocks
where a man wouldnt find a color in seven
lifetime and now were in two days of it
and-
  he didnt finish breaking off with a long-
drawn deep breath his pipe had gone out
and he leaned forward picking up a blazing
bit of dry pine which he beld to the black-
ened bowl dick farley noticed that the
bronzed lined face was very calm the eyes
somewhat wider opened than usual the
fingers upon the fagot as steady as should
be the fingers of a man without nerves
  johnny- farley was speaking at last
with an effort keeping his tones as steady
as his partners-jou are right when you
say that there are some things which we
cant explain but its up to us to explain
what we can isnt it you havent thought
of those men for a long time and now they
flash up before you all of a sudden and clear
cant it be that i have happened to use
some expression that ben used or that some
sound from the woods about us or some smell
or even an odd color in the sunset-
  thats like you dickie fight until
youre in the last ditch and then go on
fighting watson shook his head no
that aint the right explanation this trip
ive seen them three men today ive
seen flash devine jerk up his hiad with

adventure
a little iunnv sort of twist to the left like
he always used to and ive seen the red
spot by parkers ear id clean forgot them
little things dick no pard theres no
use trying to explain i got to thinking
about it this noon while you was staking out
the horses and i made a little drawing you
can use it i pass out before we get to the
place its on a dgareet paper and i poked
it inside old shaggys saddle-blanket and
now boy- standing up his shoulders
lilted and squared-good night if it hap-
pens i dont see you any more-
  he put out his hand suddenly young
dick farley gulped down a lump in his
throat as he gripped johnny watsons
lingers for a moment they stared into
each others eyes-then watson turned
away abruptly and with no other word went
to his blankets
chapter ii
forward
tt was johnny watsons voice swear-
ing at old shaggy that awoke dick
farley in the early dawn farley stared up-
ward through the still tree-tops at the gray
morning his mind groping for the unpleas-
ant something of last night and when he
remembered he smiled thinking how he
would chaff his partner about his night fears
and his dead men
  but when he caught a swift glimpse of
the deep-set eyes under the shaggy gray-
sprinkled brows the bantering remarks
which were trooping to the end of his tongue
were left unuttered in a blind sort of way
he realized that the thing which had come
upon johnny watson yesterday had not left
him those eyes were looking out upon
death calmly expectantly a bit reluctantly
but not with fear and not with rebellion
farley said nothing as he turned away and
wxnt down into the creek-bed to wash his
hands and face
  over their breakfast of coffee bacon and
flapjacks the two men talked lightly of this
and that with no mention of last night
when watson had finished he began speak-
ing of the days work into ihe cafion he
told briefly where they would leave the
creek in three or four hours where the
would find water for the noon camp where
more water and grass for the evening camp
tonight-we ought to be there by six-
we get over the ridge and into the devils
pocket country theres just one way to
get out of that country dick and thats the
way were going in if a man looks for a
short cut if he goes skallyhootmg east or
west north or south of the place where our
trail is going to cut into the basin there
hes a goner
  if you leave this trail on the way back
youre going to run out of water first thing
and your horse is going to break his leg if it
aint his neck the next thing and then you
die because you cant pick up another water-
hole  was in that country moren a dozen
years ago there was three of us me being
lucky in them days i got out the others
didnt and i aint never been back until i
took a whirl at it last month
  the morning sun had not yet peeped
down into the steep-walled ravine in which
their course lay when the two men led their
pack-horses out of its shadows along the
higher bank upon the right and  n the
little bench land there they moved
swiftly with long swinging strides and a
watson had said within three or four hours
they left the creek entirely moved east-
ward through a cut in the mountains which
rose steeply against them and found what
might once have been a trail
  conversation had died watson was in
the lead at times hidden from his compan-
ion a hundred yards in advance then
came the two horses and in the rear his
brain leaping from the talk of last night to
watsons accounts of the place where the
whole side of the mountain was rotten with
gold to wondering about this devils
pocket dick farley followed silently
  they camped a little at noon by a spring
which watson had marked upon his map
and rested for a couple of hours the older
man unostentatiously and without effort at
concealment unlimbered the two heavy re-
volvers at his belt and looked to them as a
man does when he expects he will use them
  the cards aint played yet dick he
said and if it dont come too onexpectcd
were going to give em a run for their
money old timer
  during the silent hours of the afternoon
farley strove to keep his partner always in
sight hurrying up the lagging horses keeping
them at watsons heels and although he
still told himself that he did not and would
not believe in this senseless superstition he
carried all day a forty-five-caliber colt
beyond the law

all day they drove steadily into the
mountains for ahead of them was
the thing which had called to them
across the miles of wilderness which since
the world was young had drawn men into
hardship exile and often enough to death-
soft yellow crumbling gold and it was
almost eight and dark in the narrow pass
when watson called out and farley pushed
by the horses to his side and looked on the
site for their camp-the last camp this side
the strike
  it was a spring which bubbled out clear
and cold upon a little flat hardly bigger than
the barroom at the eagle hotel and
oddly there was no creek flowing from it to
mark its whereabouts for the water ran a
scant ten feet westward and sank into a
great fissure in the rock
  well eat first said watson when the
two men had drunk the moonll be
up pretty quick then ill show you some-
thing-what the devils pocket country
looks like
  the day had died slowly it did not
grow dark for with the rising evening
breeze the full moon climbed up through a
tangle of fir-tops and barren peaks its strong
white light driving all but the most valiant
stars from the sky watson knocked the
dead ashes out of his pipe and got to his feet
  come ahead dick well take a look at
where were going where a good many
men have been-and not many come back
they climbed from the trail along a spine
of rock to a black spire rising clear of the
scanty brush to the very top of the sloping
rock they worked their cautious way until
their two gaunt bodies stood outlined
against the sky here they found footing
and here watson stood with arm flung out
pointing dick farley was not unused to
the thousand moods of the mountain places
and yet as his eyes ran along the pointing
arm and beyond it eagerly he muttered his
startled admiration
  the moon full round and yellow had
floated clear of the distant ridges and hung
in rich splendor above a long narrow twist-
ing valley the devils pocket trees hills
peaks and ravines stood out in the soft light
black and without detail the floor of the
winding valley took upon itself many shift-
ing shades a dark silver-gray here where
there was a strip of sandy soil a more som-
ber splotch there where the willows followed
a thin thread of a stream
  there she is watson exclaimed that
thread of willows marks the only creek in
the valley it runs from a big spring like
ours here and the lake drinks it up they
call the lake the last drink well walk
fifteen minutes before we get to it we hit
the southeast shore just about where you see
that little bay with the cliffs coming down
close theres a trail along the base of
them cliffs we follow that worsen six miles
futher and when were there dickie boy
were right on top of the biggest gold-
mine-
  his voice broke off sharply and he
turned his back to it all dick heard him
move back down to the trail with his eyes
filled with the panorama below him dicks
thoughts drew back from the trail and the
ore at the end of it and followed the man
who had found the thing the precious thing
which they had so long sought and who
had turned back for his partner that he
too might have his share
  and again he told himself that his fears
of last night which had been growing all
day were groundless senseless-that john-
ny watson could not be in danger of death
chapter iii
farley makes a vow
tefore he climbed down the way
watson had gone dick farley again
turned his eyes along the trail which was
to lead him tomorrow to the cup of gold
his wandering fancies built a golden dream
future then he turned back and climbed
slowly down to the trail
  the fire was dying upon the little rocky
ledge where he had built it an hour ago
beyond the camp-fire where he had flung
his blanket at the base of the cliff johnny
watson was already lying farlcv swept
up his own blanket from the ground and
stepping around the fire flung it down close
to watsons
  i dont believe in your premonitions
pardner he said with a little laugh but
if they get one of us theyll have to take
two heres where i pitch my tent
  johnny watson made no answer he
was already asleep johnny never wasted
time in wakefulness when he had turn-
ed in
  farley straightened out his blankets
jerked off his heavy boots and socks and lay

adventure
down his elbow close to watsons and
so he went to sleep
  something awoke him it might have
been the moon shining lull in his lace he
rolled over upon his side shifted his wide-
brimmed hat lo shield his lace from the
light and still he did not go back to sleep
he felt restless uneasy-inexplicably un-
easy those confounded things johnny
had said last night wouldnt leave him
there was no sound not a ripple upon the
surface of the nights silence save the mur-
mur and trickle of the water he should
be able to hear the horses-the chain on old
shaggys halter
  he sat up doing so he put his right
hand on the ground beside him beside
johnny watson he felt something damp
spongy and sticky he lifted his hand
staring at it in the moonlight there was
a dark stain he put it to his nostrils
  good god he cried aloud johnny
johnny
  and then when johnny watson did not
answer he did not need to look he knew
johnny watson was dead-dead at the side
of his partner who had slept
  the young man staggered to his feet and
stared wildly around each rock and tree
and bush stood out clearly in the moonlight
with its shadow flung out very dark and
very distinct his revolver was rigid in
the tense steel of his grip there was noth-
ing there was no one and yet while he
slept some one had crept upon his partner
  he turned to where watson lav and
suddenly as he saw how the man was ly-
ing the way an arm lay at his side the
other arm flung out the truth came upon
him and without looking at the wound he
knew that death had not come upon wat-
son while the two men lay side by side
  it had come while farley stood alone
upon the top of the cliff staring out into
devils pocket dreaming for as watson
lay now so had he lain when farley camc
down to him he had been dead when his
partner called to him saying they would
sleep side by side
  while i was up on the rock farley
muttered dully they got him
  he stooped low over the prostrate body
and gently tenderly he moved it so that it
lay face-up the moonlight showed well
how johnny watsons death had found him
at the side of his bared neck was a cut such
as a broad-bladed knife would make a great
gash two inches long just one blow lad
been struck jist one such blow needed
   farley got slowly lo his feet and for a lit-
tle stood looking down into the dead mans
face and the face of the man who looked
into the dead eyes was as oddly quiet and
calm
  they got you johnny farley was say-
ing in a voice void of expression with me
in calling distance- oh johnny
  for a moment he stood his face sunk
into his two brown hands and then sud-
denly he whirled about his head lifted his
arm dung out shaken with a frenzy of rage
  my pardner - youve murdered my
pardner he shouted and im going to
lind you out im going to kill you
  then he suddenly calmed as he realized
that he was alone in the mountains a weeks
travel from the nearest mining-camp alone
with his dead partner he moved back
from the ledge and into the shadow where
he sat down upon a broken boulder all
once a thing which he had forgotten swept
back over him-the horses he had missed
the noise of their crunching he had failed
to hear the jingle of old shaggys tie-chain
  he sprang to his feet and ran down into
the little clearing where they had tied the
two pack-animals they were gone  i oth
gone he stumbled over one of the pack-
saddles with its load there had been no
time to take that but the other old
shaggys saddle was missing
  slowly he made his way back to the lit-
tle ledge where johnny watson lay again
he sat down upon the bit of boulder and
lighting his pipe pulled at it steadily staring
down into the quiet canon he could not
follow tracks until morning
with the tirst glint of the new day
he buried johnny watson
  for a moment dick stood hat in
hand looking at the little mound of earth
which he had made and piled high with
stones and then he turned and walking
swiftly strode back to the spot where the
horses had been staked
  there was no difficulty in picking up the
trail upon that rugged rocky mountain-
side the murderer if he had taken the two
horses with him must have moved east-
ward and into the devils pocket or in a
direction leading southwesterly over the
trail which farley and watson had come
yesterday he could not have scaled the
beyond the law

cliffs above he could have made no prog-
ress through the dense brush of the deep-
cut ravine below
  for a moment farley hesitated between
going forward toward the little mountain
valley and turning back then the thought
came to him that he could hope to learn
what he sought to know by going forward
quicker than by swinging back toward the
southwest for if the two horses had gone
eastward it would be easier to pick up their
trail than upon the path which they had
cut up yesterday if there should be any
fresh tracks leading into the devils pocket
that would settle it and not ten minutes
later having followed the stony trail until
it dipped a little into a bit of soft soil in a
hollow he found the tracks-fresh tracks
made by two shod horses
  then he went back to last nights camp
made himself a small pack of bacon and
coffee and flour and taking no useless thing
no blanket even to interfere with the free
swing of his body he turned east and struck
out swiftly
  he followed the trail for a mile saw how
it wound in and out climbing and dipping
worming slowly toward the pocket and
then when he had been assured that the
two horses were ahead of him he left the
trail and fought his way due east up the
face of a steep bank and to the crest of the
bleak mountains he remembered watson
had told him that following the trail they
would have to go a good fifteen miles to
travel ten and now he sought a short-cut
to head off the man he followed he knew
that he would pick up the trail again in the
valley
  hour after hour he trudged on his face
whipped by tangled brambles in the canons
his hands torn by the crags over which he
continued to climb toward the top of the
ridge
  at last about the middle of the forenoon
he came to the top of the narrow divide
from an out jutting crag he looked down
into the valley before him seeing again the
winding course of the creek the little lake
the steep mountain walls and gorges here
he stopped long enough to choose the way
he must go to make the best time and
then with one long look back toward the
slope where the lone cedar flung its twisted
branches over his partner he turned again
eastward and plunged down into the steep
canon down into the devils pocket
chapter iv
farley takes a tumble
on the floor of the devils pocket
dick farley came upon the trail again
as he had foreseen where it ran from the
ridges across the creek he found tracks he
drank first and then studied them and
slowly there came a frown into his eyes
and then a look of pain
  for there were the tracks of one horse
and of a mans boot-heels in the soft wet
soil-tracks a month old the tracks which
johnny watson had left when he drew out
of the valley to find his partner
  back and forth farley moved stepping
slowly by the side of the path searcidng
long and carefully for the fresh signs to teil
him that two horses had passed here during
the night or in the early morning he did
not find them but a moment later at the
very edge of the stream close to the spot
where he had just flung himself down to
drink he found that another man had lain
there drinking he saw the prints of the
heavy boots saw that they had come from
the west that the man had crossed the
stream here stepping over the mere thread
of water and had pushed on toward the
northern end of the valley and the horses
  dick had no doubt this was the man he
sought for some reason he had left the
horses in the hills hidden in some steep-
walled canon
  again farley pushed on following the
trail seeing now and again the outline of
the heavy boots where the soil was moist
or dusty in a little he ceased to look for
the tracks excepting at long intervals for
they led straight ahead keeping to the path
through the win- grass straight toward the
lake at noon he stopped to eat and smoke
his pipe and then again he pushed on
  he was tired now but be gave no respite
to the muscles which had been greatly taxed
after a night of wakefulness
  finally a little after noon he came to
the lake shore where the trail ran close to
the waters edge and at the base of the dills
which rose a perpendicular twenty feet here
fifty feet there and when he had drunk of
the dear cold water and had turned from
looking out across the mile of dimpling
crystal mountain fringed he made a dis-
covery a discovery which came very close
to costing him his life

adventure
  rising straight up through the clear air
above the cliffs at his side was a thin wisp
of smoke such as climbs upward from a lit-
tle camp-fire his heart beat quickly at
sight of it it was back from the cliffs
maybe a quarter of a mile he judged
there must be a sort of table-land up there
there he would find the man he had fol-
lowed he saw that the tracks had come
to the lake here ahead of him that they
continued northward along the shore but
again he left them again to make a short
cut and began working his way up along
the cliff-side clinging with his fingers to
seams and crevices driving the toes of his
boots into the cracks which they could find
he drew painfully slowly toward the top
  he was already so close to the edge above
that he could almost reach it with a hand
thrust up as far as he could reach with fif-
teen feet between him and the ground be-
low he was straining every muscle his
face tight-pressed to the rocks reaching up
for the rough hand-hold which just defied
him when he was startled by a sound com-
ing clearly to him from below-the unmis-
takable sound of the dip of a paddle
  he saw the trap he had blundered into
as he was he could not turn could not
draw a gun from his belt there he was
clinging to the face of the cliff a mark to
be seen from across the lake with no hope
of being overseen by the man who in a mo-
ment would drive a canoe around the rocky
point a few yards away who could shoot
him in the back as easily as lift a finger
  again he strained upward and at last he
succeeded in grasping the rock which pro-
truded from the edge above and drew him-
self up then he heard a cry from below a
cry as of warning the rock came away in
his hand he clutched wildly to save him-
self then plunged headlong twisting as he
fell as his body had struck he felt a swift-
driven pain through his head and lost con-
sciousness in a black nothingness
  luckily for him the fall had been broken
for he had twisted his body so that a part
of his solid weight struck upon his shoulder
for life was still in him and came back lit-
tle by little he tried dizzily to lift his
head and could not but he could turn a
little to the side so that he could see the
lake there was the canoe its paddle float-
ing in the water and coming toward
t was all so vague he was so dizzy the
blackness wavered so like a misty veil in
front of his eyes for a little he would not
believe that his mind was clear yet that he
was not wandering for coming toward
him was a girl a girl clad in rough coarse
cloth made into a short skirt and sleeve-
less blouse a girl whose long braided hair
was scarcely a deeper richer brown than
her bronzed cheeks as brown as an indian
maid but with great fearless gray eyes
she came swiftly to his side and dropped
down upon her knees flinging back the
thick braid which had brushed across his
breast
  i tried to call to tell you she was say-
ing her low-toned voice coming to him
clearly through the singing in his ears
are you very badly hurt
  he didnt answer at once but stared up
at the fresh girlish beauty of her frowning
to clear the mist from liis eyes telling him-
self that it was impossible
  she leaned closer and put her quick light
hands upon his head he felt a little shud-
der run through them and then before he
could speak she sprang up ran to the lake
and came back to him with water in h--r
two hands she bathed the cut washed the
blood away and ripping a strin of cloth
from the hem of her skirt tied it about his
head in a rude bandage
  i thought- he began groping for
words
  yes yes she broke in you could
not know how crumbling how treacherous
to the climber those rocks are up there i
tried to warn you are you very much
hurt
  no i dont think so he answered still
frowning and then you-where did you
come from
  she laughed sitting back from him-her
hands clasped about her two knees her chin
tip-tilted a glimpse of her round throat tell-
ing that the bronze and copper of her col-
oring were not racial that the slender body
was of wonderful white and pink
  no youre not badly hurt or you
wouldnt be wondering about other folks
  with an effort of will he drew his eyes
away from her and turned them out across
the lake he had come to find a man the
man who had killed his partner and in-
stead this was what he had found this
naiad of a creature who was no shy back-
woods lass tongue-tied and blushing but
who looked at him with clear amused eyes
beyond the law

  was johnny watson wrong about this
devils pocket after all he had said that
few men ever came into it that they never
came back that they never lived here
then how came this sparkling radiant
woodland maid here where had she come
from now in her light canoe where was
she going were there others
  slowly his eyes came back to her
  i didnt know any one lived here i
thought-
  then what brought you here she
asked
  i came looking for-some one
  and then realizing that this statement
contradicted the one he had just made he
said by way of explanation
  i meant that i did not know that wom-
enfolk ever penetrated so far into the wil-
derness miners i know lone prospectors
get into all corners of the earth
  and womenfolk she challenged him
are there then any places where men have
led that their womenfolk have not followed
them
  he again tried to sit up but sudden black-
ness swept upon him and he fell back the
gleam of amusement went as swiftly from
her eyes which were once more deeply wom-
anly intensely feminine and soft her cool
hand was upon his forehead pushing back
the tangled hair smoothing it and her
voice cooing tender came to him like a
whisper out of a dream
  you are hurt badly hurt dont try to
move just rest be very still
  once more she sprang up and ran to the
lake shore to bring water in his hat she
wet his forehead readjusted the bandage
and let a little trickle of water run upon his
wrists in a moment he opened his eyes to
look up at her forcing a smile to meet her
anxious gaze
  can you tell me she said softly where
you are hurt you cant move
   try again in a minute its my whole
side the right side he glanced down to-
ward his hand i think the wrist is broken
i got it caught under me as i fell i cant
move it
  it is swollen already she told him after
a brief inspection poor fellow how it
must hurt
  then as professionally as a trained nurse
might have done it she moved her hand
down along his side
  where does it hurt most she queried
her eyes upon his the shoulder isnt it
  yes just a bad bruise i think
  i hope so now do you think that after
a while when you have rested a little you
can manage to walk just a few feet
yes but wherell i walk to
  just to the boat and   take you the
rest of the way
  and the rest of the way he asked curi-
ously
  you are a mighty inquisitive creature
for a patient she smiled where do you
suppose home of course
chapter v
the girl from the lake
dick rested for a long time then lean-
ing upon the girls firm shoulder he
got to his feet and moved slowly with her
to the boat when he had sunk in a hud-
dled heap in the narrow craft his pulses
beating wildly his head whirling he began
to realize he had a great deal besides a scalp
wound and a broken wrist to reckon with
  with a swift flash of a glance at his white
lips and the little drops upon his forehead
the girl stepped into the boat took up the
paddle and pushed out into the lake and
under her strong hands the canoe shot
through the water headed for the north
end of the lake and for a little cove cliu-
bound
  dick half slept as the canoe sped on and
on finally he roused as they rounded a
rocky point flashed by a little green cove
into which a narrow spray of water fell
from the cliffs above skirted a dense pine
grove and turned suddenly into a second
tiny bay sandy-beached the canoe its
slender nose thrust into the pebbles and
white sand held there swaying gently be-
fore farley could move the girl was out
standing in the shallow water her left hand
steadying the boat while her right reached
out to help him
  if you feel strong enough its only a lit-
tle way and you will rest better
  ashamed of his weakness in the face of
her confident young strength he got to his
feet already it was a harder thing for him
to stand than it had been ten minutes ago
his right shoulder side and arm were utter-
ly useless his leg when he put a little of
his weight upon it pained him so that with
his lip caught sharply between his teeth it
-
adventure
cost him much to keep back a cry of agony
  but in the end leaning upon her her arm
tight about him he got into the water and
to the strip of sand looking anxiously for
some sort of camp he saw ahead only a
thick grove of pine and fir like the one they
had passed and the sheer clilts beyond
  i think she was saying to him that
if you rest again you will only be the stiffer
sorer for it can you manage to walk a lit-
tle further
  he nodded and now he staggered on
with his guide and into the trees and when
at last she stopped he again looked up ex-
pecting to see the camp instead he saw
that they had brought up at the edge of
the level strip with the cliff-wall in front of
them
  were going up there she answered the
puzzled look in his eyes it isnt as hard
as it looks can you go a little further
  he nodded again painfully so again
they moved on ten feet along the cliffs and
came unexpectedly for him upon a great
gently slanting cut in the rocks into which
bits of stone had been flung so as to make
rude rough steps it was harder now slow-
er for he had to lift his left foot each time
while she helped relieve the weight upon
the other and wearily pull himself up ten
minutes dragged by before they had climbed
the twenty feet
  upon the top was a plateau perhaps a
mile long broken with trees and boulders
five hundred yards wide the fringe of
trees and ragged cliffs upon the side toward
the lake hid the table-land completely from
that direction and set between two gnarl-
ed cedars at the very edge of a dense bit cf
the forest where it ran out from the sea of
verdure like a cape was a low rambling log
cabin a thin spiral of smoke winding up
from its stone chimney here was home
  the cabin had all the signs of age dis-
colored by many winters a vine a dozen
years old climbing over it and johnny
watson who had known the devils pocket
for a quarter of a century had said that no
man ever lived here
  but dick farley was in little mood for
specu lation he stumbled on conscious on ly
of the dizzy nausea which drove even the
pain of his hurt side into a dim faraway
background after an endless groping
through a thickening fog he knew that they
had stepped from the sunlight into the
shade felt rough boards under his boots
felt that two arms not jut one were tight
around his body knew wiih a grateful long-
drawn sobbing breath that he was lying
upon blankets
  it was dusk in the cabin-twilight fra-
grant with the spicy odors dropping down
from the grove-when he found himself at
first groping for reality in a confused chaos
of emotions and then gradually coming to
full understanding it was a great low-
walled room a rectangle of light marking
the door two squares showing him the win-
dows and a deep-mouthed fireplace crack-
ling with a newly lighted fire
  across the room from his bunk were a
heavy little table and rough chair his
eyes went slowly to the floor-over the
squared saplings which went to make it
across a bearskin and to another door
smaller lower than the other leading into
another room he tried to lift himself upon
his elbow and fell back stabbed by ihe
sharp pain in his shoulder and then he
turned his head quickly toward the narrow
door then he had heard a step
  she came swiftly to him looking down
at him with her great eyes filled witli con-
cern when she saw the look in his she
smiled and sitting down upon the edge of
his bed put her hand upon his forehead
  you are better her rich voice was say-
ing in a matter-of-fact way youre not
so feverish and you know where you are
dont you
  yes much better he called up a
twisted smile to meet hers and then i
have been an awful nuisance
  you mustnt say such things-
  but he insisted looking steadily at her
if you hadnt happened along-if you
hadnt found me then or soon-do you
know what would have happened to me
if i hadnt died from my fall and exposure
id have died pretty soon from starvation
do you know that
  i know she retorted with great mock
severity that this is my case youre my
patient and im the doctor and the nurse
and that youre talking whue i believe the
proper thing for people who are sick is to
lie still also youre not going to die of
starvation now when i heard you stir i
was just making some soup for you for
im the cook too
  when she had come back with a smoking
bowl of broth she set the thing down upon
the floor for a moment while she insisted on
beyond the law

propping him up with pillows she shook
her head at him when he opened his lips to
protest and thrust a spoonful of the soup
between them by way of further silencing
him
  good she demanded when she had
set the empty bowl down on the floor
and now do you know i am afraid that i
have about reached the end of my medical
knowledge ive forbidden you to talk and
ive fed you some broth what next
   therell be nothing next im going to
be all right soon
  of course you are but we must do
something for your poor hurt side i have
some liniment-
   just the thing he assured her ill
give myself a good rubbing-
   you are very stupid she frowned at
him you will do nothing of the sort i
havent dismissed my case yet have i mr
man
   youre discharged miss girl he grin-
ned up at her and my other name is far-
ley-dick farley
   i wont be discharged that way and my
name is virginia dalton and you lie right
still dick farley she laughed at him
   and when she came back she made him
lie upon his left side while she slit his shirt
from the shoulder down and bathed the
bruised muscles with the stinging oil the
wrist swollen and ugly she bandaged with
soft white cloth when she had finished
she sat back flushed but triumphant and
nodded at him approvingly
     ith the fire roaring in the deep fireplace
 for chariness rather than from the need of
 warmth with a couple of misshapen home-
 made candles upon the mantelpiece her
 chair drawn up facing the bunk upon which
 her guest and patient lay-at her request
 lie was smoking his pipe and enjoving it-
  irgima dalton at last satisfied the mans
 curiosity as well as she could
 she and her father lived here together
 had lived here for hrteen years he had
 wrought her a baby of four into this wil-
 dness with him had built the cabin had
 made this home of the world outside she
 knew hthe more than she had known when
 her lather brought her here-perhaps ess-
 as even the childs images of men sd js
 en and cities and the things thereof had
 been lost in the years the father had
 taught her had brought with them a few
 books had been always very dear to her
she did not know why he lived here away
from his kind he had once long ago told
her that his health demanded it of late
they had not mentioned the matter
   but she ended with a flush of eager-
ness lighting her face its nearly over
were going to leave soon go back to the
world where people are dear old daddy
came in just this afternoon a little while
before i went down to the lake and i could
see right away that something had happen-
ed he didnt say what it was-he doesnt
say much at any time but he told me that
he was going out again and might be gone
all night but that when he came back i
could get ready to go isnt it glorious
  but dick to whom there had come a sud-
den fear made no answer frowning as he
lay back staring up at the rough rafters
chapter vi
virginia gets a letter
nphe night dragged by bringing little
sleep to dick farley and virginia
daltons father did not return it was the
longest night dick had ever known hour
after hour he sat propped up against the
wall the pillows behind him and smoked
staring out through the open door at the
shadows the moon made they were deep
black shadows and his spirit was caught in
them strangely troubled but at last when
the tardy day was breaking the spark in
his pipe-bowl died and he slipped down in
his pillows and slept
  when he awoke the sun was flinging its
light through the tree-tops into the cabin
natures was a soft mood this morning-
smiling fragrant audible with many low
harmonious woodland notes and through
the weave of still music rising suddenly
clearly sweetly a girls voice floated in to
him in an old song he watched the open
door expectantly
   in a little while she came in her voice
hushed walking tiptoe not to wake him a
rod in one hand a string of lake-trou t swing-
ing from the other her smile was as glori-
ously a radiant tiling as the morning itself
when her eyes met his expectant ones
  good morning she greeted him com-
ing to his bedside awake at last are you
i was afraid i should have to breakfast
alone
good morning he answered his eyes
adventure
filled with the rosy beauty of her glorious
youth you have been fishing already
i have been down to the lake-for my
morning plunge primarily to tell the truth
and in the second place for something for
my sick man to eat hungry
  as she went to set the rod in its place in
the corner he looked after her approvingly
her hair hung as yesterday in two long
braids one flung over her shoulder her
brown arms were bare from the shoulder
  yes he answered her i think  am
hungry while you are starting breakfast i
think ill get up-
  youll do nothing of the kind she re-
torted positively ill put a table close to
your bunk and well eat here after break-
fast when the sun is a little higher and its
good and warm maybe ill let you try to
get up
as she moved toward the kitchen with
her string of fih he called after her
your father he hasnt come in yet
no but well look for him before long
dear old daddy has dreadfully irregular
habits
  then he heard her clattering with pots
and pans heard her singing broken snatches
of songs and soon the roma of coffee and
the sizzling of the trout told him that
breakfast was ready she came in then
removed the objects from the table across
the room-he saw with a little surprise that
they were several books carelessly scattered
-pushed the table to his side dragged her
own chair up to it and brought in the fish
and coffee and biscuits with tin cups tin
plates heavy iron knives forks and spoons
  there is no sugar no butter no cream
she laughed at him but you wont mind
will you
  while they ate she told him more of her-
self how she fished or used the rifle to bring
down a squirrel from a pine or to get a
deer sometimes how from her lookout a
peak a mile behind the cabin she mused
over the pale shifting shades of daybreak
or the vivid splashes of color in the west
before the dusk came how she let her eyes
go far out to the furthermost rim of the
vague distant mountains and dreamed of
the other side-the land of men and women
of cities where the cafions were streets and
the peaks many-storied buildings she
was not lonely because no one had taught
her the word because she had known no
existence but this she did not know un-
rest because she had not lived in cities
  but sometimes with a sudden wistful-
ness there is something here which talks
and i cant quite understand it she
pressed her two hands tightly upon her
breast when i have everything here how
can there be anything lacking when the
world is so big how can it seem so little
when the day is so filled with good things
how can it seem so empty when i am so
happy how can i be all of a sudden so
sad when i am laughing why do i want to
cry-
  he told her too of his own life of the
schools he had gone to of his work in cities
of the east of the command to go west for
his health as her father had done of the
fever of gold but he said no word of his
partner-he could not speak of that yet
nor did he mention the cup of gold saying
merely that he had pushed into these moun-
tains into her valley prospecting
  but you said she reminded him
frankly that you were looking for some
one
  yes he admitted turning from her
clear eyes to the door i will tell you
about that some other time
he questioned her about her
father and she glad to find other
ears than the inattentive ones of her
woodland friends spoke unreservedly
  he was a wonderful man this james dal-
ton this dear old daddy a wonderful
man to look at big mighty of his hands
handsome a full-bearded giant with a
great tender heart too forgetful at all times
of self striving only for his daughters good
and happiness doing all of the thousand
and one little things to please her to make
life run smoothly and brightly for her
   he had filled the long hours with instruc-
tion had taught her to read and write had
read to her from the few books which had
come with them into their exile he had
drawn pictures of busy cities with their
factories and hotels their churches and
stores and he had promised her that one
day he would take her with him to see
these marvelous things with her own eyes
  and now she ended her eyes luminous
with the dreamings of a golden fairyland
whose gates were to be thrown open to her
now we are going to see it all very soon
  she fell suddenly silent looking beyond
the far horizon where her fancies led her
beyond the law

  it is worth being raised like this far-
ley was thinking just to be able to walk
out into the other life-the life filled with
the things man has done to wander
through it a little-and then to come back
to stay
  when all of the chill of the mountain
morning had gone drunk up by the warm
thirsty sun she allowed her sick man to
get up farley found that his wrist was
more swollen more painful than it had
been last night but began to hope that
there were no bones broken in it that he
had sprained it badly and that in a few
days it would mend itself his right side
was very nearly useless to him the shoulder
lower ribs and leg being sore and stiff but
with a cane which she cut for him from a
sapling in the grove he was able to hobble
around slowly
  he realized as he worked his way un-
steadily to the door that it would be many
days before he could take up the trail which
he had vowed over his dead partners body
to follow until he found its end
  the morning passed and they had lunch
together out under the trees at the edge of
the grove still dalton had not come in
but the girl seemed in no way surprised
saying lightly that her father often was gone
a day or so without warning that perhaps
he had found and was following the tracks
of a bear
  i am going for my mail she told him
laughing at his wonder do you feel
strong enough to come with me
  mail he demanded incredulously
  yes there may be a letter from
daddy the post-office is over yonder
across the lake if you think that you can
walk down to the canoe we can paddle
over
  with the help of his cane with the aid of
her hand when they came to the rude steps
in the clilt side he finallv reached the edge
of the lake where they had left the canoe
yesterday leaving him here for a little
she disappeared into the trees and came
back presently carrying the light boat upon
her shoulders
  helping him to get into it she pushed out
from the shore jumped in and paddled out
into the water heading straight for the
western side a half-mile away upon a lit-
tle beach there sandy and strewn with white
pebbles she grounded the canoe and with a
word to him to wait while she asked for her
letter hurried to a big rock flat-topped
set back a little from the waters edge
  turning so that he could see what she did
she tossed toward him live pebbles which
she had picked up from the rock and then
she came back to him
  no letter he asked
  didnt you see it she laughed into his
puzzled face of course there was daddy
has gone over yonder pointing to the ridge
of hills sweeping upward into the westward
mountains how do i know those peb-
bles were in a row pointing east and west
with the biggest one at this end the littlest
our pointer at the west end and since
there were five pebbles he means to be
gone about five days no he didnt add a
postscript saying what he was going for
we need sugar and we need ammunition
also- with a little glance purely femi-
nine at her skirt-i shall want a new
dress
  but suggested farley there is no
town no camp near enough for him to get
those things and be back in five days
  he is generally gone longer she ad-
mitted as she got back into the canoe and
pushed off but it doesnt matter what
he went for does it youll have to put up
with my sole company for the five days
chapter vii
after five days
nphe days passed swiftly and pleasantly
for them-too pleasantly dick farley
told himself with something of bitterness
for what right had he to live from day to
day in this quiet haven lured out of him-
self out of his black lonesomeness for his
partner with that partner not a week dead
  it was true that his bruised side must
have kept him in a forced inactivity that
he must have waited even as he was waiting
but he should have spent day and night
with his thoughts oi squaring things fur
poor old johnny not in wandering through
the woods with a girl
  he told himself as he lay unsleeping in
the quiet night that he should go that he
should go now that he could drag himself
away from her that he had no right to stay
longer yet where should he go to pick
up the trail which he had followed to the
margin of the lake and to follow it-where
  would it bring him after miles of winding

adventure
back to the cabin perched upon the table-
land would he iind at the end of that
trail james dalton her father where was
dalton now why had he gone away so
suddenly why had he said to her the
other day the day before johnny was
killed that at last they could go back into
the world which so long ago he had left be-
hind him had he killed johnny watson
if not he who then
  if dalton had killed watson then farley
must kill dalton there was no other way
there could be no other way he must kill
the father of the girl who had brought him
here and cared for him who had saved him
from dying alone and miserable-must kill
her dear old daddy whom she loved so
much who had always been so good to her
who was all that she had in the world
  and to stay here made matters worse
to linger on in the home of the man whom
perhaps he was to kill to listen to the in-
genuous happy voice of the daughter to
grow to see how wonderful a thing nature
had built of this child of the wildwood to
feel that day by day they were being drawn
closer together that they were crossing a
frontier which in a little they could not re-
trace-
  if her father is the man who did it have
i the right to take her father from her
he muttered and again has the man
who killed johnny watson a right lo live
  so those five days were short days fleeing
so swiftly for man and maid filled with sun-
shine and the girls soft laughter and the
vague promise of life and the nights were
long nights for the man crowded with ugly
images torn with doubts beset with
threats of the future thronged with ques-
tions to which he could find no answer
now there was nothing to do but to
wait
  but there was no waiting no staying
into the path into which their feet were
wandering dick farleys and virginia dal-
tons it was the old old story of a man
and a maid and with the first gteat throb
of understanding in the mans heart here
came too a contraction and a pain and he
tore himself abruptly from the girls pres-
ence and went to stand frowning toward
the mountains into which dalton had gone
and her eyes following him were filled with
a tender light which was new to them her
lips parted in a half-smile her breast rising
and falling rapidly for into her heart
too had come the throb but not the pain of
the knowledge he had
  it was the sixth day they had been t-
gether so much had talked of self and of
the other so frankly had been so lost to the
world and drawn close to each other in the
solitude of the still mountains had come to
find a new peace and contentment as they
were silent together watching the coming
of the dawn the passing of the day the slow
voyages of the moon through clouds and
stars had been so all-sufficient each to each
that the short five days seemed like long
bursting years when they looked back upon
them it was only natural that the thing
which was happening with them should
happen
  now upon the morning of the sixth day
the day which was to bring dalton home
their talk had died down suddenly farley
had fallen into an abrupt silence his eyes
refusing to come back to hers and in a
little the girls mood followed his and with
a faint trouble in her eyes she moved about
the cabin as silent as he the forenoon
passed they lunched with now and then a
fitful burst of conversation which ended
wretchedly forced and unnatural and the
afternoon wore on it was nearly dusk
when james dalton came home
  he was a very big man tall heavy broad
of shoulder and very dark with sharp
black eyes under bushy brows black hair
and beard shot with gray he came upon
them from the lake walking swiftly his
rifle caught up under his arm the girl was
sitting upon the doorstep farley upon a
rock a few feet away daltons eyes wedt
quickly from the young man to his daughter
very keen with a glint of surprise in them
  daddy the girl cried running to meet
him throwing her two arms about his neck
so you have finally got tired of roving and
have come back have you
  he ran an arm about her and then
with no reply to her bantering demanded
quietly-
  who is that
  farley was on his feet now missing noth-
ing that the big man said no gesture he
made
  my name is farley he returned for
himself a miner i came into this coun-
try prospecting had a bad fall and your
daughter took care of me
  prospecting dalton laughed unpleas-
antly dont you know young man that
beyond the law

this country every foot of it has been gone
over and over during the last twenty years
and nothing ever found prospecting
he strode by farley towards the cabin mut-
tering so they come right under our nose
and prospect
sas he went farleys eager eyes saw
the hunting-knife which swung un-
scabbarded from his belt-a knife
more than usually broad-bladed and his
heart sank little as he liked the looks of
this man he had prayed that he prove to be
innocent of johnny watsons blood at the
door dalton stopped and swung about look-
ing steadily deep into farleys eyes
  when did you get here he asked
shortly how long have you been here
  i came five days ago-the day you
left
  where did you come from
  from the coast then from three
sisters and the yellow queen country
where ive been prospecting
  what brought you in here dont you
know that this country has been combed
over a hundred times-that there is nothing
here
  i believed farley retorted quietly
that there was gold in these mountains
since my fall i have not had a chance to get
about so i havent learned yet that there
isnt
  virginia dalton had stepped a little from
her fathers side and now stood with trou-
bled face looking from one man to the other
there was an atmosphere of distrust al-
most of open hostility and she could not
understand
  dalton turned slowly from farley to the
girl as he moved the iron rigidity left his
face the cold glint passed from his eyes
it was wonderful how the mans whole ex-
pression softened
  come here virginia he said gently
i want to talk with you a little mr far-
ley with grave courtesy will pardon us
  farley bowed dalton with his arm
about his daughter entered the cabin clo-
sing the door behind them leaving the
younger man alone with his doubts his sus-
picions his fears their voices came to him
confused indistinct he supposed that the
father was asking all about this intruder
in their quiet eden whence he had come
what she knew of him and his purposes
  - mally the door opened and dalton stood

on the threshold looking steadily out at
farley
  i trust that you will overlook my rather
scant courtesy in greeting a guest mr
farley the tone was open frank pleas-
ant i am afraid that living a sort of exile
in the wilderness so many years has made
me forget the social usages will you come
in for a pipe we can talk things over
  i think farley replied his eyes running
past the broad form so nearly filling the
doorway to the form of the slender girl
standing within the room that i have al-
ready allowed myself to become a nuisance
  miss dalton has been very kind to me
but for her i imagine i should never have
come so easily out of my accident now i
am able to be about again and i think that
ill take up the thing which brought me
here i have some work to do but-
the two mens eyes meeting again each
studying the other-i shall see you again
before i leave the valley for good and -
with slow significance-i shall tell you all
about what brought me here before i go
next time
  he lifted his hat to the girl said a brief
word of thanks and of good-by and limped
away toward the lake and his heart was
very bitter as he went and there was little
hope in him
chapter vie
farley follows the tratl
ut of the few scanty details which
seemed to him to have any bearing
upon the thing he sought to know dick far-
ley strove to piece together a chain of evi-
dence which his brain could accept as point-
ing to the guilt or to the innocence of
james dalton as he drew slowly away
from the cabin and toward the cliffs which
fell away to the lake he arranged in mind
these things in a sort of logical order
  i	there must have been some strong
motive for the killing of his partner if
daltons knife driven by daltons powerful
hand had caused johnny watsons death
what motive could have moved dalton to
the act
  this point he considered a long time it
was possible that these two men had known
each other years before that they had been
enemies that revenge had steeled the mur-
derers arm but it did not seem probable

adventure
there was something a great deal mitre
likely
  could it not be that dalton although he
denied the presence of gold in the valley
had stumbled upon the same streak which
johnny had found a month ago-the cup
of gold that he had discovered johnnys
tracks had foreseen that he would return
with pack-horses and had killed him rather
than that an outsider should come into his
valley and steal his gold but why
then had he not killed johnnys partner as
well
  	the crime had been committed with a
knife unusually broad-bladed dalton
wore sue h a knife
  	something had made dalton tell his
daughter upon the day of the murder that
they were going to leave the devils pocket
and go back into the world what was it
did it have any bearing on the case if not
it was one of those odd coincidences which
occur sometimes and farley did not believe
very much in coincidences
  	the man who had committed the crime
had stolen the two horses and had hidden
them somewhere in the mountains to the
southwest of the valley dalton had gone
away into these same mountains and had
been gone five days why had he gone
he had not had time to reach any of the
settlements he had brought back no sugar
no cloth
  	dalton had lived many years in a se-
clusion which was very like hiding he
looked the part of a man who had never had
a sick day in his life he was not here be-
cause the doctors had sent him he was
a man of culture a man who had traveled
and seen much of the world he loved his
daughter why then had he suffered this
long exile why had he made her endure
it
  these matters rose above other consider-
ations in farleys mind and in the end he
saw no way of arriving at any kind of cer-
tainty until he had gone back to pkk up
the old trail until he had found the horses
until he had seen if daltons tracks led to
them and back from them to the cabin
  he stopped for a moment at the top of the
cliffs and turned to look back at the cabin
he saw the girl standing there alone her
eyes following him saw her hand go up
swiftly as he turned to wave to her re-
membered what she had done for him saw
again the clean heart and budding womans
soul which she had not thought of hiding
had not known huw to hide from him lift-
ing his hat to her he hurried down the clifts
and out of sight
  it would kill her he muttered and
then his eyes grown suddenly hard as he
tried to shut her out of his mind never
mind johnny old pardner its all in the
cards and well play it out if he did it
hell pay for it
  but when night came to him in the edge
of the mountains and he sat brooding over
his camp-fire he could not drive her out of
his wandering thoughts he saw justice on
one hand and loyalty to ones partner and
on the other he saw the face of a girl who
was going to be happy or broken upon her
lirst great sorrow-and it would be his act
to decide her life for her he bowed his
head in his two hands caught powerless in
the irony of fate
  for a week dick farley sought almost
without rest to body and brain tu work  ut
the puzzle which had been set before him
he had gone almost back to where he had
buried johnny watson before he found the
trail of the two stolen horses this he had
followed away from the valley through
narrow canons over rocky passes for two
days
  as he had known from his partners
words there was little water here he
thought more than once that he we-uld be
driven back to replenish the bottle he had
carried with him but the man who had
driven the horses here had known the coun-
try and following the trail turning with it
north or south of its general course - arlev
found enough water in small springs and
slender streams to keep the life in him and
make his progress possible
  fortunately the country was tilled with
small game the quail hare grouse and
squirrels having more curiosity than fear
coming close enough for him to kill with his
revolvers what he required for food
  he came at last upon the two horses in a
small steep-walled valley set like a cup in
the mountains here there was much rich
dry grass and a narrow stream wandering
through it with little trouble he found
the pack-saddle where it had been thrown
into a clump of manzanitas remembering
for the first time the map which johnny
had told him was hidden in a saddle-blanket
he found it readily with a swift cursory
glance at it he put it into his pocket
beyond the law

  to get the horses where they were left
in the main trail he muttered to himself
to bring them here then to go back to the
lake would take a man just about five days
-the time that dalton was gone
  it was another point a further link in the
chain but like the other links it was not
strong enough to bear the burden of cer-
tainty he must find other tracks-the
tracks the man had made when he left the
horses here he must follow them if they
led straight back over the hills to the lake
he would know and he had little doubt
that he would find them and that they
would carry him once more to the dalton
cabin
and now came the slowest the
hardest of his work to follow the
trail left by two horses was com-
paratively simple to track a man over
these mountains across hard ground and
dry gully was another matter
  it was certain that the man dalton or
a possible other had not gone back over the
same trail it was devious turning aside for
steep canons which a horse could not climb
but which a man could full of many twists
and turns a man on foot would take a
shorter way and until he knew beyond a
doubt that that man had been virginia dal-
tons father he could not tell whether to
look upon the eastern edge of the tiny val-
ley for it upon the western northern or
southern but believing more and more
that the trail would lead toward the east
he looked where he thought to find it
  and in an hour after finding the horses
he picked up the other trail-the tracks
made by the man who had brought them
here he saw the deep print of a boot-heel
in the moist soil along the creek found an-
other track a few feet farther on then an-
other-all leading toward the east-toward
devil s pocket
  a glance at the encircling hills showed him
where the tracks must lead where there was
a little nature-made pass leading over their
crets which a man might follow and he
pushed ahead in that direction positive
that he would find the tracks there if there
were anv loose soil to keep them he saw
readily that he must leave the horses where
they were for the present
it took him another hour to climb up to
e gap in the hills the darkness was corn-
mg on but there was light enough for him
to see that the same heavy boots which had
left their imprint in the soft dirt by the
creek had passed here he had done a long
days work his side was paining him again
the night was very near so he built his
fire here and made his bed of fir-boughs
  in the first light of the dawn he break-
fasted and moved on once more toward
devils pocket everywhere underfoot was
a thick mat of pine-needles upon which
a mans foot would leave no sign but the
natural pass in which he had camped led
straight on and into a canon upon the other
side of the little ridge and where the soil
had sifted down from the canon sides to lie
here and there among the rocks strewing
the bottom of the ravine was the imprint
of the heavy boots again only infre-
quently stopping to assure himself that he
was not going wrong he made what haste
he could back toward the lake and he had
gone perhaps five miles before he came upon
a discovery which caused him to stop
frowning wondering
  he was in a small clearing sandy-floored
the tracks were here still leading east
but no longer was there the single trail
here plainly outlined were the prints left
by two men they were side by side alike
fresh a very few days old
  farley had just come down a long rocky
slope into the clearing and did not know
where the second mans path had met the
first there was little use in going back in
trying to find out he sat down filled
his pipe and tried to make out the meaning
of this new complication who was this
second man where had he come from
where was he going had he been with
dalton or had he been trailing dalton or
had dalton been following him
  in the end he could not see that the new
tracks made any great difference if the
trail he was following led on to the lake to
daltons cabin the thing was clear enough
  down the long slope of the mountainside
from the clearing into the rocky bed of the
ravine the only logical way for a man to
follow and out into a miniature valley be-
low he continued without looking for the
tracks which he knew the hard broken
ground would not show had he looked
  it was two miles before he again found
the boot-tracks in a bit of soft soil and
here again had one man only one man
passed the other the second had evi-
dently turned aside across the rock-strewn
ioo
adventure
side of the mountain-had gone on his way
prospecting
chapter ix
farley plnds his man
tt was very quiet in daltons cabin
  were it not for the figures which the
flickering firelight found out uncertainly
casting their grotesque wavering shadows
upon the floor and wall one would have
said that there was no living thing there
  dalton sat hunched forward in his chair
-his elbows on his knees his big hands
knotted together his eyes on the coals
scattered across the stone hearth near
the door standing erect his eyes upon the
still figure his whole attitude that of a man
waiting was dick farley now and then
he turned his head a little and looked sharp-
ly over his shoulder into the darkness out-
side as if he feared interruption
  so said dalton after a long silence
no part of his body moving save his lips
liis voice without expression so youre
his pardner  was afraid so all along
  yes farleys answer was as quietly
expressionless i was his pardner
  dalton stirred in his chair farleys
body lost none of its rigid motionlessness
but his hand the right one dropped quickly
to his hip dalton had reached for his
pipe filled it and lighted it with a coal
which he picked up in his fingers farleys
hand remained upon the grip of his revolver
  im sorry mighty sorry dalton went
on without looking up and then is
there anything else you want to say
  i guess ive said about all i camc
into this country with johnny-my pard-
ner we were looking for gold yve were
interfering with no man johnny is dead
murdered it wasnt even a fair fight
who did it i havent jumped at con-
clusions i probably would if it hadnt
been for- he hesitated a fraction of a
second during which for the first time
dalton glanced up swiftly at him-for
miss dalton i wanted to be sure i
tracked you from one end of the trail to the
other to the cabin here i think its pretty
clear so i came here to accuse you of his
murder
  it was the first time he had spoken so
clearly but the two men had understood
each other without this putting a name lo
a deed
  i dont like that word farley ballon
cut in his voice its expressionless as before
his form as still you tall him johnny
well mens names change often enough
out in this country for us not to quibble
i suppose hes carried a good man names
since i saw him last
  you knew him a long time ago
  yes i hadnt seen him for over fifteen
years until-
  he didnt finish instead he said after
a moment
  and being his pardner you are going to
try to square things for him to be judge and
jury and hangman to kill the man who
killed him well every man is his own
court out here where we are so far beyond
the law and when a man is dead it is up
to his pardner thai is the way you feel
about it
  yes dalton laughed mirthlessly we
are beyond the law here-we are not bev ond
the reach of justice justice-or revenge
it is hard to see one for the other some-
times you want to kill me then
there is no use talking that way
dalton farley frowned you have lived
here too long you know too well what is
the result of the thing which you have done
-you dont deny it
  will it make any difference what i
  i dont know i dont think so
  you are going to try to kill me dalton
continued that wont help your dead
friend much but youll do it just the same
i have no desire to be killed by you or bv
any other man but soon there is going to
be another dead man here-you or ij and
virginia i wonder what she is going to
do that complicates mailers but it
doesnt in any great degree alter them
does it shell be back from the lake
pretty soon wed better get this over
with unless youll listen to a proposition
im going lo make
  what is it
  that you let me tell you a story then
that you give over your though is of re-
venge-or justice-for tonight and that
tomorrow or the next day ac soon as i can
get things in shape for the girl so that if i
am killed she will have a chance with trie
world we go out into the woods somewhere
and-finish it
  it can wait farley replied until
tomorrow
  dalton inclined his head gravely
beyond the law
ioi
  thank you now if you will listen to
ray story  wont you sit down farley
dropped to the chair at his side i had
trouble in richmond where our home was
i killed a man why doesnt matter to
you unfortunately for me i killed that
man in the presence of another who saw the
thing done that other man was your
pardner he hated me as cordially as i
hated him in any court in the world he
would have sworn that it was cold-blooded
murder and his word would have hanged
me
  he would have lied when he said it but
he would have sworn it just the same as
it was i had to run for it virginia was a
little baby six months old her mother-
his voice growing very hard-was not
strong she died i wasnt with her
i was being hounded from one place to the
other and the man who hounded me when
the whole thing would have been dropped
the man who was the real murderer of my
wife was the man who made it necessary
for me to run before what men call justice
i did go back and get the baby then we
came here
  again and again as the years rolled
around i got word from the world each
time to hear that what the world had for-
gotten was not forgotten by the man who
was not satisfied in my exile my loss of all
the things which counted he was still
looking for me he still would stop only
when he saw me given over into the hang-
mans hands a few days ago i found that
he had penetrated into this wilderness
his prospectors outfit did not mislead me
he was looking for me i was glad of it
i told virginia that soon we were going
back into the world from which we had
hidden so many long years i killed
him
  you murdered him replied farley cold-
yu glven him a cilance-
  how do you know i murdered him
fhancer- y w  didnt	a
nzhtlhle ihis throt-death
upoa him suddenly unexpected he
may have been asleep even
  talking about it doesnt help dal-
nnvpv a man bored with a worn-out
 ou are gng to wait until to-
i -rr r  ur justce i have some
wit h h rvrt t wrle for virnia  carry
ner l have some instructions to leave
her i have a good deal to do for some-
how- he looked up with a strange smile
upon the tightened lips- i imagine that
you are going to come out of this alive and
im going to come out of it-dead youll
wait until tomorrow
   ill wait
  farley got to his feet dalton rose with
him
  youll sleep here tonight
  no ill sleep outside-not far away
meaningly
  oh i wont run away laughed dalton
good night
  farley made no answer as he backed to
the door and stepped swiftly outside he
closed the door behind him and strode
rapidly away into the darkness of no
mind to sleep he built a little fire of dead
twigs and pine-cones and sitting upon a
fallen log stared into the flames moodily
he had sat there motionless for
five minutes when something im-
pelled him to look up standing
a few feet from him just witiiout the circle
of his firelight was virginia dalton he
rose quickly took a step forward and
stopped he did not at once speak wait-
ing for her
  so you have come back she said gen-
tly i have missed you
  yes i have come back
  and you found what vou wanted to
find
  i found what i was looking for i dont
know that i wanted to find just that he
ended bitterly
  she came slowly toward him until she
stood in the firelight so near that he could
have put out his hand and touched her
he saw the brown arms reflecting the waver-
ing fire the dark braids the full round
throat her eyes even deep and earnest
and something he glimpsed in their quiet
depths sent a quick pain to his heart
  yes she answered as if he had spoken
i heard i listened outside i heard
every word she broke off only her
hands clasping each other tightly showing
him that the calmness of her still figure
was forced over a tumult within and
so she barely whispered after a little you
have come back to kill dear old daddy
  he moved back away from her back
from the quiet misery in her eyes making
no answer and she came with him step

adventure
by step until he had stopped and put her
hand upon his arm
  you have come back she repeated in
the same lifeless tone so different from the
glad note which he hud so often thrill
through her voice to kill daddy is
that it
  you heard he muttered heavily
  yes he killed your pardner she
shivered and the hand upon his arm grew
very tense so you want to kill him will
that do any good it will make me very
miserable it will take my father away
from me-all i have and will it do your
pardner any good
  why did you come he cried out
fiercely you dont understand
  dont i understand she smiled at
him-a wistful wan little smile which hurt
him more than if she had cried out aloud
i understand this much tliat in all the
world  have but daddy and that he has
been always so good to me and that you
want to take him away from me
  i understand that you want to kill
him because he killed your pardner and
that it wont do any good for you to kill
him it wont bring your pardner back to
life it wont make him rest any easier i
understand that these things are not for
men to do but for god god sees better
than we can see and clearer and deeper
down into our hearts and he would not
do what you are going to do he would
not take my daddy away from me
  when he made no answer finding no
answer to make she stood silent a little
letting her head sink forward despairingly
and then again lifting her eyes to his
her lips her chin quivering as she strove
to make her faltering voice firm
  dont you sec that you will make it
seem almost as if i had killed him myself
lor if i had not brought you to the cabin
you would never have found it maybe
if i had not thought you were a friend and
brought you there maybe you would not
have lived dont you see
  dont you sec again groaning aloud
he had drawn back from her and she had
come to his side once more had again lain
her hand softly upon his arm and dont
you see something else we were growing
to be such friends you and i dick farley
didnt i read right the things which you
did not say that day you went away the
things which were in your heart didnt
you see the things in my heart too didnt
you see
  he fell her hand tremble pitifully saw
the anguish written upon her young fate
  we were going to be good friends-oh
such good friends and now-with a dry
sob as she put her face in her two hands and
shook from head to foot with the storm in
her bosom-and now you want to end it
all and to kill him
  for a blind moment he fought hard with
the thing which she had thought was friend-
ship and then seeing her swaying there
seeing her mute misery he put out his arms
and drew her close to him
  friends he cried his voice harsh in
her ears like the voice of a man in anger
friends cant you see that i love you-
love you as a man can not love his friends-
as he can love only the one woman in all
the world
  she lifted her face quickly to his md
through the tears glistening upon iv-r  heeks
he could see a new look a look of gladness
and of hope
  oh she whispered drawing closer in
the embrace of his arms i am glad
and you wont hurt him now you cani
for a little he held her to him tightly
pressed as if defying the world to ti-e her
away from him and then slowly his arrrs
loosened and dropped to his side for
again he had seen johnny watsons face
staring up at him through the faint light of
the dawn again he realised that because
she was daltons daughter dalton was none
the less his partners murderer
  what is it she asked softly isnt
it all right now
  it is all wrong virginia dear he said
bitterly and this only makes it more
and more wrong dont ask me anything
more only go back to your father and let
me think things over - his voice
was hard and steady- i dont know
what is going to happen i dont think
that i am going to kill him w ill you kiss
me good night dear
  he watched her as she went slowly
through the night watched her as for a
moment she stood in the dim rectangle of
light made by the open door and then bad
only the darkness and the shooting flames
of his camp-fire about him
  johnny he muttered when at last
there was but a dead pile of ashes where
his fire had been if  dont kill him if
beyond the law

he kills me instead-it will be all right
wont it johnny
chapter x
justice
the day had come and dick farley
was firm and calm in his determina-
tion but the thing which the day was to
bring need not come yet there was no
call for haste while there was an urge deep
down in his soul to spend this day alone
he turned his back upon the cabin and
went walking rapidly down to the quiet
shore of the lake
  until now he had scarcely more than
glanced at johnny watsons map the
cup of gold had seemed the small thing
which gold is always when come the great
vital issues of life but now it was dif-
ferent now he could see a reason in going
on over johnnys trail in finding the hill-
side that was rotten with gold this
was something which must be done before
he looked into daltons eyes again-for the
last time
   a long curving line along one side of the
brown cigarette paper was marked in pain-
fully small letters east shore a dotted
line marked trail ran along this high
cliffs indicated the spot where farley had
attempted to climb up to the plateau
where he had fallen the doited line ran
on by this close to the lake shore and was
marked  mile then there was a little
triangle with the words big white rock
here the dotted line swerved at right angles
-to the east- paces here was the
word canon that was all upon one
side of the paper upon the other written
lightly was
  enter mouth canon go straight about
five hundred yards climb dead pine-tree
leaning against east bank straight up to
top of ridge follow ledge to clilt look
along bottom of cliff and that was all
  farley put the paper again in his pocket
and turned north along the lake shore
he had perhaps two miles and a half may-
be three miles to go and be was growing
anxious to see this mine which his partner
had discovered
   it was a simple matter to follow the trail
a natural path at the lakes edge kept open
by the deer and other woodland animals
that came down lo drink or browse upon
the long grass here and before he had
covered more than half of the two miles he
saw the big white rock which johnny
had marked for him close to the water
rising straight up from the level floor of the
valley
  here with a glance at his map to make
sure that he was right he turned eastward
counting his steps he had stepped off one
hundred and twenty-five when he stopped
frowning for nowhere were the moun-
tains far from the lake and already he had
entered a canon and johnnys map had
said two hundred paces
  johnny wouldnt make a mistake like
that he told himself
  and again counting he moved on and
into the canon until he had counted another
seventy-five paces then he understood
  here cut into the wall of this canon was
a second a narrower steeper-walled ravine
evidently the one johnny had had in mind
when he said enter mouth of canon
the general trend of this one was north and
south he pushed on into it estimating
roughly the five hundred yards
  and then with a little quickening of the
pulses he saw the dead pine-tree it had
fallen and now with its roots half torn out
of the rocky soil lay sprawled against the
eastern bank of the canon at an angle of
about forty-five degrees the banks here
were so steep rising fifty feet above him
that a man would have had a hard time
climbing them but the fallen tree was at
once a pointer to the cup of gold and a
ladder to reach it
  up on the top of the bank he found the
ridge and working his way slowly along
that he came to the long line of cliffs which
standing above made the side of the moun-
tain look like a giants stairway and now
liis heart beating with the exertion of the
struggle upward and with the eagerness of
quickened anticipation which comes to the
miner at a time like this no matter what
face the day wears he stopped and let his
eyes rove along the bottom of the cliff
  and in a moment he saw what he looked
for and hurried forward there were the
marks of a pick in the crumbling bank and
there-
  poor johnny he muttered poor
old johnny to feel his pick sink into this
to have it in his hands-and never to really
work the greatest mine this country ever
saw

adventure
  for here showing so that a novice must
liave seen and known and understood the
glittering promise of it was a great vein of
gold laid ban against the bottom of the
cliff-side where last years snows had set
the rocks free above where the side of the
cliff had fallen outward disclosing the thing
which the mountains hail hidden so well
and so long
  it was as rich as any pocket the miner
had ever seen-richer and it was not a
pocket at all but a wide deep vein which
ran back into the mountainside which
would make not one man but hundreds of
men rich would give them riotous days
and wild nights would bring to the realiza-
tion of dreams long dreamed and johnny
watson the man who had found this who
had turned back with but a handful of the
precious stuff that he might bring his
partner with him was dead and would
never take out a nugget
  all in the cards johnny he mused
bitterly and the cards are running
wrong for you and me
  he sat upon a boulder his eyes brood-
ing over the yellow promise his heart
heavy with the love for a lost partner and
the newer love for a woman who was to be
lost as soon as he had found her the
shadows drew back from him the sun found
him out and still he sat staring at the thing
which promised and mocked
  at last with the short laugh of a tired
man he got to his feet stood for a little
looking at the smooth cuts a pick had made
in the rocky bank and then with no further
spoken word with no look behind him
moved slowly away and went back along the
ridge down the pine-tree and to the lake-
side
  there he sat down upon the big white
rock and with the stub of a lead-pencil
wrote a letter upon the bit of oiled paper in
which his pipe tobacco was wrapped
  virginia dear if i am never to see you again-
and who knows how a day like this is going lo end
-this is to say good-by for mr i think that you
knew how much i love you before i told you last
night- so t do not need to tell you again i didnt
think that love came this way so swiftly i am
glad more glad than you can ever understand lhat
it has come you will go back lo the world i
want you to be very happy t am enclosing a
little present a farewell gift i want it to help
make you happy dear good-by
dick farley
      and folding the paper he put
  into it johnny watsons map
- then he went back along the lake-
side and to the cliffs below the cabin to
wait for james dalton
  he thought that it must be about ten
oclock when at last dalton came walking
swiftly from the cabin farlfej got tu his
feet and waited neither man spuke until
dalton came within a dozen paces of him
and stopped then farley said quietlv-
  ready
  yes
  the mans face showed no emotion there
was none in his steady voice
  your revolver is of a smaller caliber
than mine farley went on iu a slow
matter-of-fact tone you can have one
of my forty-fives if you want it
  dalton looked at him curiously
  thanks i dont want it and then
after a short silence in which the t o men
eyed each other steadily there is no
other way
  no there can be no other way f
kill you or-you kill me
  then dalton answered as if he had
expected this if i dont come through it
you will find a couple of letters in my pock-
et give them to virginia
  i have written a note too farley said
by way of reply it is for her
  with slow steady lingers he drew a re-
volver from his holster for the instant
he lost sight of the man in front of him as
his eyes went upward along the cliffs and
his thoughts ran ahead of them to the cabin
and the girl there the world was un-
naturally silent the pines about them like
carvings in jade without a tremor the
sunlight falling softly about them the
moment was strangely lacking the thrill of
excited nerves he had anticipated
  that he and this man were  landing so
close together that each held a revolver in
his hand that death was very near and
the world and life and love drawing very
far away did not impress him as he would
have said that such a thing would impress
him the whole thing was too big meant
too much for him lo grasp it
  virginia may come daltons deep-
toned voice startled him we had better
-hurry
  yes he answered we bad better
hurry
  so they stood facing each other a gun in
beyond the law

cach right hand the muzlcs downward
there was not twenty feet between them
  we shoot together dalton was ask-
ing him
  yes and the signal
  count three that will do as well as
any way will you count
  farley nodded and his voice quiet
low steady with regular pauses between
the words said
  one-two-three
  the two shots rang out together like
one and the two men their faces gone
white and tense drawn stood looking at
each other through the slowly lifting smoke
for as he fired farley had thrown the
muzzle of his gun downward so that the
ball plowed through the sand at the feet of
virginia daltons father and daltons bul-
let had winged its way high overhead
seeking the far shore of the lake
  - you cried farley shrilly a red
flood of blood in his face as he understood
why did you do that do you want to
be killed man
  the man who could have killed him had
spared him the man who had murdered
johnny watson had stood up courting death
and had made no attempt to save himself
and the knowledge only maddened the man
who had chosen to die himself at the hand
of the man he could not kill-no not even
to square tilings for a dead partner
   i have killed two men in fair fight in my
life dalton told him sternly his own face
flushed hotly i am not going to kill a
third and i do not choose to be made to
look like a fool french dude in a polite
duel are you going to kill me
  farley laughed evilly
  in fair fight he mocked to cut the
throat out of a man before he had seen you
to sneak up on him in the dark-andyou
call that fair fight
  i gave him his chance and he took
it-not being a fool
  a chance scoffed farley the rising
anger within him making him for the second
forget that this was her father his gun
raised to drive your-knife through
a mans throat-to come at him in the
dark-
  i used no knife and i came upon him
in broad day fight and i shot the throat
out of him after i got this
  he threw back his shirt collar and showed
a raw wound at the base of his neck and
dick farley suddenly seeing the light of a
great hope dropped his revolver into the
sand as he clutched daltons arm
  dont lie to me he said in a harsh
whisper for he had remembered those
other tracks he had found and his whole
body was shaking with what it might mean
to him where did you find him
  dalton looked at him curiously as if
upon a madman
  over yonder his arm swung about
until his outstretched forefinger pointed
toward the west-not the south where
he had left two horses in a little hollow i
followed him back-
was he a little man and stocky
farley was crying hoarsely blue-eyed
a little blond mustache-
  he was a man six feet in his stockings
dalton retorted staring black-haired
and blacker-hearted if he was your
pardner-
  he wasnt my pardner dont you see
man it came with sudden conviction
with a great gasp of relieved nerves
you-you came upon the man who killed
johnny you killed johnny watsons mur-
derer
  and as dalton stared after him like a
man stunned dick farlev was running
across the sandy beach and toward the
cliffs for he had seen the slender figure
of a girl coming slowly through the trees
and he had a wonderful message of life and
hope and love for her

lixty-wan - sebenty - three
renshawe sahib to play sang
i out the madrass marker with
soulless monotony and pushed
the little ivory pointer along the score-
board with the end of the cue-rest
  it was one of the four-handed games so
popular in the planters club of darjiling
renshawes partner whooped and praised
his maker aloud
  oh billy he yelled look at your
position our enemy is delivered bound
into our hands heres the beginning of a
twenty break even for you
  renshawe tore himself with visible re-
luctance from his occupation of gazing ab-
stractedly out of the window across the in-
tervening ranges and valleys at the tremen-
dous snow-peaks of the himalayas and
building dream-castles born in the shadow
of the great range where his earliest im-
pressions had been built around the won-
derful legends of the hill-people about that
mysterious unexplored region the silent
beauty of the everlasting snow-caps had al-
ways drawn him with an indefinable desire
to go look-see
  he came forward and looked at the lay
then he waved aside the proffered cue-rest
and bent over on his toes he was not tall
-only live feet eight-and his great breadth
of shoulder made him look even shorter
  easy now with a good follow and re-
member youre against the nap cautioned
crandall the partner
renshawe bent his great shoulders over
his cue grunted an uncompromising huh
of acknowledgment and carefully followed
his instructions
  then crandall took the name of the lord
in vain with fluency and point he further
improvised several variations while he
strode around the table and tore hi hair
  renshawe smiled cheerfully and said
nothing what he thought nobodv could
tell
  nobody ever could tell what renshawe
thought his face which wore a habitual
smile of cheerful indifference to whatever
fate the world might hold in store for him
was otherwise inscrutable arid gave not the
least clue to what was going on behind the
mask
  what he did for a living was equally a
mystery which in india where everybody
knows everybody elses most intimate af-
fairs was unprecedented they knew of
course that he had been born in the coun-
try and that he had later been sent home
to some city which they generalized vaguely
as america to be educated and that later
again he had returned and wandered for
the last seven years all over the far east
but what he did and how he earned ids
money of which he always seemed to have
a reasonable supply nobody had ever been
able to discover
  and at this several old duennas who
were exposing their wares in the shape of
daughters and nieces and other relatives in
the recognized marriage market of the hill
sanatorium were considerably piqued for
in india the first requirement of the busi-
ness on which all calculations are based is
how much does he make and the next
is it a pensionable job 
the oath by the earth

  mrs southerland who was a walking
whos who of diabolic memory and
who wrote society notes for the darjiling
standard lost sleep on account of this en-
gaging young man for she reflected he
dressed well and had plenty of time on his
hands-good omens further the crafty
old huntress deduced from his apparent si-
lence and diffidence in the presence of wom-
en that he would be easy game and mrs
southerland had a daughter on her hands
with a figure like six oclock and a com-
plexion that looked as if the moths had got
at it
  wherefore she conspired with an infatu-
ated subaltern of her string the man of
war proclaimed loudly that this was the
simplest thing imaginable why he would
confront him and ask him point-blank
and with the sheet-metal sensibilities of
many of his kind he did
  his colossal vanity lured him to select
the club of all places as the scene of his
discomfiture with fatuous confidence he
tackled renshawe in the midst of a group
who had appealed to him to settle a point
of dispute about the best means of hunting
mountain-sheep for somehow people had
got into the habit of going to renshawe for
information and his information was al-
ways direct and accurate the military
genius broke in on the conversation with
what he considered the psychological force
of direct and unexpected attack
  whats that said renshawe hardly
believing that he had heard aright
  the trained lighting unit repeated-
  we were wondering what you intended
to give as your ostensible means of liveli-
hood for the new census old man and-er
we-
  ah i see and you thought youd ask
raet that vas extraordinarily clever of
you  he same careless smile llitted over
the lace but the voice dropped to an even
monotone i make my livelihood duch-
esne by attending very carefully and most
conscientiously to my business
  which of course was an insult direct
and llagrant and the officer and gentleman
should have properly resented it but even
while his face flushed and a blustering an-
swer rose to his lips the cold colorless light
from the others eyes like a reflection from
his own beloved snow-peaks seared into the
lieutenants soul his eyeglass melted out
of his eye and he withdrew
  renshawe went on quietly explaining that
one of the youngest males is usually posted
as a lookout while the oldest and best head
following some mysterious instinct of self-
preservation nearly always managed to
surround himself with females
  this was the man wrho couldnt play bil-
liards and whose partner cursed him soul-
fully while he smiled apologetically
       was it ruskin who remarked after
watching a young man who played
an extraordinarily good game
there is the result of a wasted youth
meaning presumably that the same time
and perseverance might have been spent to
so much better advantage
  nobody could accuse renshawe in this
respect his life had been too strenuous at
baseball he wras a joke cricket to which
the english pray was of course a sealed
book to him at football he was futile
tennis to him meant a series of terrific
smashes that lost countless balis and ruined
many rackets
  all the more refined and less profitable
games found him wanting but he could
handle a sword like an officer of the foreign
legion he could box like an american he
could wrestle with all the skill and cunning
of a jap and rolling these all into one he
could fight like-well as little shannon a
profane but invaluable member of the secret
service who had once experienced the joy
of witnessing him in action said he could
fight like-
  but these accomplishments were not of
the kind that are usually displayed before
an audience of admiring girls wherefore
many of the perspicacious folk among whom
he lived regarded renshawe with something
of pity and condescension
  and renshawe was perfectly well aware
of it and smiled away in complete and
glorious indifference to their opinions
  secret service - renshawes frequent
mysterious disappearances led many who
knew him to speculate on this as his profes-
sion but others who knew him better
said no renshawe was the kind of turbu-
lent and restless spirit that would never tie
itself dowmi to hold a job from anv boss-
much less the government of india which
meant many bosses each with a completely
developed idea of his own heaven-designed
magnificence
  and they were right yet secret service
io
adventure
was as near as one might well get to de-
scribing his profession he was what the
natives call a go-get-it-man he ac-
cepted commissions to procure anything
from an ancient piece of china to a rare or-
chid or a young rhinoceros
  this repertoire included valuable infor-
mation in which connection he had on
several occasions worked for the secret
service but he insisted on working inde-
pendently and strictly for results he re-
fused to cumber his time with tedious re-
ports as to the how and why he invariably
procured what was required and declined
to enter into long explanations much to
the inward rage of tape-bound officials
but still it was renshawe they sent for
when their own men failed and renshawe
took a diabolic delight in treating them all
as if they were plain human beings instead
of gods and in conscientiously flouting all
prescribed and therefore reverenced pro-
cedure
  this was the man who cheerfully ac-
quiesced while his partner beat upon his
breast and called him a diplodocus and an
abysmal anthropoid but then his small
experience of billiards had been snatched
during the infrequent and limited periods
between his strenuous expeditions which
he called loafing he had never been able
to loaf long enough to acquire skill in games
even the present period had reached its
limit and while his partner was still groan-
ing a servant announced with diffidence
that a messenger insisted on seeing the sa-
hib immediately
  renshawe excused himself and went out
but the unprecedented occurrence of a na-
tive insisting on seeing a white man was so
extraordinary that the others followed
  now were going to butt in on billys
business shouted one of them boister-
ously
  renshawe looked rather annoyed at the
intrusion then he looked at the messenger
and grinned all around to the back of his
neck
  what the devil is he chortling about
queried the partner
  renshawe grinned some more and then
turned slowly and addressed the man in the
lepcha dialect he had recognized the
mans tribe at a glance and he knew that
there were only three white men in the
world who could speak the language of the
aboriginal hill-folk
  well ill be double - announced
the most eager of the interlopers in disgust
as he led the way back to the billiard-room
boy i require drink peg bring it
whats yours you fellows renshawe
youre an outcast we drink alone
  well inquired renshawe of the mes-
senger
  sahib there is one down at bhutia busti
arrived from the north who would speak
with thee on a matter of importance with-
out delay
  what is the affair and who is the man
who desires me to make this long journey
at such short notice
   sahib the affair i know not it is secret
and the man is a stranger-from tibet
his speech shows that he is no bhutia
that seems to me insufficient cause to
make so long a journey
  that is in the sahibs decision but the
man sent a sign saying show this to the
white man and he will come 
  he groped in his bosom and produced a
short stick of some dark wood abr ut si
inches long and exquisitely carved with
kiang-hsi characters
  renshawe did not need to take it into his
hand
  it is sufficient he said quietly i
come within the hour
he strode back to the billiard-
room
  awfully sorry you fellows he
began i must beg oa the rest of the
game its a matter of business which calls
me to bhutia busti ill finish the match
tonight if you dont mind waiting
  tonight hear him why man theres
no horse in darjiling that can take you
down to the bhutia village and back by to-
night
  i know it an i ain a goin to ride no
hawse my go walkee wralkee but ill
have to hurry so long reserve the table
for after dinner ill surely be back and
help crandall lose his money
   he strode out full of energy and itality
as a storage battery singing chid mera
burria tum-muka-loo which is a lewd song
of the bazaars to the huge delight of the
club porter but the significance of the
song was lost on the white men who merely
grunted and called for more refreshment
  if he gets back bv tonight announced
topleigh ill eat the doth off the oldest
the oath by the earth

table in the club its twelve miles and a
drop of over five thousand feet
   and ill eat a set of snooker balls sup-
plemented crandall a paliari might do
it but theres been no european since old
cristensens time whod come near it
   but renshawe never troubled to inquire
what other people had done before him he
invariably set out to do his little best which
was a often as not just a little better than
the other fellows
  he traveled by the sheer up-and-down
choor-batos of the hill-folk and arrived
at bhutia busti in just one hour and a
half
   in the old tumble-down serai he found an
aged lama just preparing to receive him for
the messenger had arrived only a few min-
utes before the old man apologized pro-
fusely with infinite courtesy and peered at
him through his great tortoise-shell-rimmed
spectacles then
  ait aie just such a man as i was
told he muttered and meandered off into
a long buddhist platitude on the virtues of
promptness
   my father i have need of haste gent-
ly reminded renshawe
   ah i might have known such a man is
ever in a hurry it is well my son you
have seen the sign
   yes my father i know it well it is
from thetesho-lama at lhassa and i came
as you see with speed
   good the great one said it would be
even so and he bade me remind you of a
certain promise and say that the time was
now come when you could-receive back
your word by performing a service
   t hear
  my son the matter stands thus at
the time of the great tribulation- he re-
ferred to the recent tibet expedition when
lor the first time in history a foreign force
had entered the forbidden citv - the
reat buddha with its attendant images
was hidden from the eyes of the foreign
evils vet for our sins in a past existence
happened that some impious hand dis-
covered the hiding-place and stole away the
six lesser images these with much labor
we have since been tracing and in this mat-
ter lies the service
  the old man peered narrowly at ren-
shawe again to observe what effect his
speech was having he might as well have
gazed at the sphinx
   my fathers words have my attention
 said renshawe gravely
   the lama continued
   the image of silver my son which is as
 prescribed in the attitude of the oath by
 the earth with the great emerald set in the
 breast we have followed through many
 hands till it has lately come into the posses-
 sion of one lutf-ullah a dorabi to him
 we sent an emissary to obtain the same by
 purchase but the man is a man of vio-
 lence he slew our messenger and is now
 returned to his own country therefore
my son-
   he paused with an expressive and inquir-
 ing look
   what is the mans village said ren-
 shawe noncommittally
   nay we know not he is of the zukkha
 khel and was formerly a dorabi in the
 battery regiment
   renshawe grunted and muttered more
to himself than to the old man
  hm and the tesho-lama wants me
to hunt up this cut-throat among his own
people across the afghan border and get
the goods a long quest my father and a
difficult is there no further i dentin cation
of the man
   nay my son that is all but this we
 know the man is tall having a black beard
 and fierce it is little enough but the great
 one said there was no other in his knowl-
 edge who could undertake the matter
 hm renshawe grunted again and sat
 a long time thinking
   there is also suitable reward the old
 man insinuated
   i had no thought for that my father
 where the tesho-lama is concerned there is
 no need of bargaining but this thing needs
 haste
   it is indeed so my son lest he sell
 and the image be lost again
   and i await a letter of much importance
 from my own country which is not due for
 at least a week
   he thought a while longer in silence
while the old man watched him anxiously
   at last he arose and his face showed that
 he had not a care in the world the lama
 rose too but his face was sorrowful
    see that my son has surely put this
 trouble away from him the great ones
 spirit will be heavy
  but that was only renshawes way
having once come to a decision his soul was
no
adventure
free from care sufficient to the day was
the evil thereof
  nay ray father he said i start with
tomorrows sun
  the old man gaped with surprise then
he bowed to the ground
  it is even as the great one said he
muttered
the same evening renshawe fell
like a bomb into the club not that
his coming was noisy he walked in
with the springy silent tread of the jungle-
man but his appearance struck at least
three of the members like a nihilist demon-
stration
  renshawe played execrably but crandall
was too overcome by the shameful knowl-
edge of his indigestible wager to raise a mur-
mur
  well its good night and good-by for a
while you fellows said renshawe when it
was all over and crandall had paid his
share i have to start for the punjab fron-
tier tomorrow
  hear him talk about the punjab fron-
tier as if it were only a weeks journey
  renshawe grinned
  and say i wish youd tell the clerk to
hold ali mail till i come back i dont want
it chasing all over the country after me and
never finding me dont forget this is im-
portant now
  and the letter that renshawe was so ex-
ercised about that leads back to a year
ago and of course to a girl
  renshawe had accumulated enough sa-
vings to take a trip home and visit his peo-
ple and there he had met the most won-
derful girl in all the world and after the
manner of strong men who have found but
little time to cultivate women he wondered
how she had escaped from heaven and
poured out seven years of pent-up devotion
at her feet he was a new type in her mi-
croscopic orbit this clean-cut man of swift
decision and she had proceeded with alac-
rity to add his scalp to her collection then
another man had come scalps the exact
counterpart of his hung at her belt in rows
for she was very beautiful there was noth-
ing new about him bui-he possessed a
motor-car which of course made decision
a matter of much difficulty
  hitherto the most wonderful girl had
found no trouble in controlling a many-
stringed bow with neatness and despatch
but renshawe was not of those lesser ani-
mals that are content to hunt in packs his
nature was too big to crave the support or
tolerate the presence of others on his trails
wherefore since he was a product of cen-
turies of western civilization and very
much a man he did not fall upon his rival
and rend him with his teeth but instead
proposed very gently to the girl that since
he had to return to his work shortly in any
case he would give her a year in which to
make up her mind at the end of which time
she should write and communicate her de-
cision
  this she promised with tears and soft
clinging arms and many protestations that
there was no need-she knew her mind
but the next day she went for an automo-
bile ride just the same-west is west
yar mahomed of the zukkha
khel clan climbed swiftly up a steep
spur of the sufed koh range that
overhung the peiwar kotal pass and grunt-
ed fiercely as he swung his long limbs fr m
crag to crag leaping clutching and scram-
bling as only a born mountaineer can
  arrived at the summit he wriggled into
a nook well down from the skyline and
peered out along the winding track that led
through the kurrum valley over the border
into india
  he crouched all careless of the precipice
sheer to the pass at his side and gazed out
under his pent brows like some grim bird of
prey his keen dark face with its great
hooked nose and fierce eyes and the very
posture of his body bunched forward with
the lean neck outstretched heightened the
impression of a great eagle watching for its
victim
  the eyes were the most peculiar part of
the man-swift and keen flashing inces-
santly from point to point not by any
means shift or afraid but the alert eyes of
the untamed creature constantly on the
lookout for danger and prepared to mini-
mize it by meeting it more than half-way
  after a long and careful scrutiny the grim
mouth curled in disgust and the man spat
vindictivelv into the pass below
  thukka-auahl the dog delays he
muttered and his talons curled caressingly
around the stock of his rifle a beautiful
weapon which carried its own story
  for a long while he brooded for all the
world like a larger and tierccr edition of
the oath by the earth
in
william tell waiting for his gessler then
he spat again and climbed slowly down with
the comforting reflection that if ailah
willed tomorrow or if not the day after
or the day after that all time was before
him and being an oriental he was blessed
with infinite patience
  yar mahomed was by profession a man
and according to the conventions of his
race and that part of the world he fiued his
job very thoroughly that is to say he
made war upon his neighbors and hated his
enemies in these degenerate times of
peace and since the influence of the british
had begun to make itself felt it was aston-
ishing how far a man of action had to travel
to find suitable neighbors
  but whether on the kurrum border or
down among the beluchis or away up in
baltistan wherever there were wars and
rumors of wars yar mahomed arrived soon-
er or later with his trusty rifle-an older
and less satisfactory one of the present
weapon more anon-to enlist his services
on whichever side looked like winning for
there would be the most loot for the rest
he was scrupulously honest true to his salt
and possessed a very fine conception of his
personal honor an insult to which he would
resent with an immediate knife-stroke a
whole man
  the rifle needs special mention to itself
for in that country the rifle is quite half the
man yar mahomed had long been dissat-
isfied with the weapon he had been carrying
it was an old martini-henry acquired in
one of the innumerable border-skirmishes
with the british and had supplanted his
yet older native-made jezaij for a jong
while his heart had been content but there
came a time when he had temporarily hired
himself as a guide to a sporting englishman
who had come into the mountains to shoot
  this man possessed a wonderful weapon
which would carry true as a hair for a thou-
sand yards and good enough to be certain
o	yur man for a considerable distance far-
 r anc ar mahomeds soul lusted for
the beautiful thing but he had taken the
white man s pay and therefore figuratively
eaten his salt and the rifle with all the
other possessions of the white man were ti-
ered
  ar mahomed beat his breast and groan-
ed in anguish and shortly allah rewarded
his honesty the englishman was so
pleased with his guide in every way that he
confidcd to him that a friend of his a young
lord from england desired to come on a
similar trip and that he would surely tell
his friend to seek out this prince among
guides the friend would be due in bannu
on the british side on such and such a date
  yar mahomed went out and prostrated
himself many times to the west allah
was god allah was good in shallahl
  i	have said that yar mahomed was strict-
ly honest and he was as was proven in the
case of the englishman he would have
stabbed anybody without hesitation who
would have suggested to him that he should
steal a horse or a rupee or a handful of
grain but rifles and ammunition are the
gifts of god to mankind free as the air they
breathe and the water they drink and as
such belong naturally to whoever can ac-
quire them and keep them
  yar mahomed praised god for his
bounty and was very sure to make no mis-
take about eating salt this time the
lordling arrived and went into camp with
strange guides punjabi dogras recom-
mended by the commissioner it was
childs play the lordling slept as they
sleep whose lives have been spent in per-
petual security and the dogras were stuffed
with unwonted luxury in the neighboring
tent-and the moon was flecked with fleet-
ing shadows-
  it was as i have said a beautiful weapon
-a ballard  high velocity bolt-action
and llah had further provided two hun-
dred rounds of ammunition
  this was the man who daily climbed the
sufed koh and perched above the feiwar
kotal gazing across the valley with hungry
eyes
of course there was a girl in it
or rather as they arc there desig-
nated a woman the most won-
derful woman in all the world-tall and
straight as a young pine from carrying
water-jars on her head yar mahomed
went straight to her father and offered forty-
five good silver rupees which was all he
possessed
  the old man demurred the girl was tall
and strong and would be able to extort
quite an extensive patch of corn out of the
bleak mountain side thereupon the ar-
dent young man with all the impetuosity
of a lover offered his old rifle the martini-
henry which was really worth five or -is
i 
adventure
girls the old man snatched at the chance
and the bargain was struck
  now it happened that there was some
small bickering among the waziri tribes
and thither hastened yar mahomed in the
hope of acquiring the wherewithal to set up
housekeeping he left the most beautiful
embodiment of all the virtues in the care
of her father with many injunctions re-
garding her safe-keeping quite forgetful in
his new sense of proprietorship of the fact
that the old man had managed to keep her
in perfect safety hitherto this duty ac-
complished he cast care to the winds and
hurried away scenting the battle from afar
with eager hawks face and distended nos-
trils
  meanwhile a cousin of his own family-
a low fellow and a renegade for he had
taken service with the indian government
-came home on leave and swaggered
among the hill villages twirling his mus-
tache with a military air and his evil fate
brought it about that he too saw the
woman he made haste to meet the father
and was apprised of the bargain already
struck with yar mahomed
  but the cousin was not bound by any fool-
ish tribal conventions of honor he was an
enlightened man he had traveled afar and
seen the ways of the white men he went
direct to the woman and explained how he
had many rupees saved up from his pay
and above all that he was a servant of the
sirkar and would eventually retire on a
pension can the woman be blamed
  yar mahomed returned in due course
but contrary to the procedure of western
civilization was not immediately informed
by sundry dear friends of the new state of
affairs across the border where strife
means knife swift and straight to the mark
those who are wise are very careful to keep
out of other peoples quarrels excepting al-
ways blood feuds which arc a matter of re-
ligious duty
  wherefore it was some little time before
yar mahomed discovered what his cousin
had done to him and since he was the
product of centuries of eastern civilization
and very much a man he set about seeking
his cousins blood
  but his cousins leave had expired and he
had returned to the protection of the sir-
kar and further yar mahomed learned
his regiment had been ordered to a far coun-
try called tibet
  that was two years ago and word had
now come through other soldiers on leave
that the man was about to return to his
own country
 which explains why yar mahomed
perched ominously on his pinnacle shading
his eyes under his hand and gazing so in-
tensely across the valley of kurrum
  on the fourteenth day his patience was
rewarded and he regarded the omen js
good for there were just thirteen little nicks
in the stock of his new rifle and just room
for one more before commencing a new line
a speck had appeared in the far distance of
the winding track and long before it came
within range yar mahomed with the ab-
normal vision of the bird he so closely re-
sembled had made it out to be the man he
sought
  he might have dropped him at twelve
hundred yards with reasonable certainty by
resting his rifle on a rock and that would
have been quite in keeping with the feudist
ethics of his people but yar mahomed
i	have said was by profession a man
  he clambered swiftly down and hid in
the pass till he could be reasonably certain
that his enemy might not escape then he
cautiously raised his head above the level of
his sheltering rock and yelled
  ahoo lutf - uuah cousin of mine
greeting
  lutf-ullah dived behind a rock with the
speed of a great hairy tarantula which he
resembled and brought his gun to the front
before looking to see where the hail came
from
  yar mahomed shouted like a schoolboy
with glee at the surprise he had caused and
called again
  it is met it is well met my cousin
servant of the sirkar who wouldst have
had a pension if thou hadst lived
  lutf-ullahs reply was a shot that plowed
up the ground twenty yards short he was
a soldier and therefore no marksman
  he fired three times more while the other
waited with cold-blooded alertness am-
munition is always a scarcity across the bor-
der and yar mahomed wanted to make
quite certain of his first shot
  he did as the crashing echoes raced
down the overhanging cliffs he coolly blew
the smoke from his barrel and strode down
the pass he surveyed the scene grimly
and nodded his head with satisfaction
  a good shot and a dean he muttered
the oath by the earth

   then he took the rifle and cartridges for
they are legitimate loot and since lutf-
ullah had been of his own family he cov-
ered the body with boulders after which
he strode off with the feeling of a man who
has accomplished a duty well done
  and when the woman would have turned
to him again with the submission of the
primitive female to the victor his eyes
flashed and he spat on the ground and
turned his broad shoulders in the utter-
most scorn east is east
ii
but there is neither east nor west border nor
   breed nor birth
when two sirong men stand face to face though
   they come from the ends of the earth
ar mahomed returned to his own
village of munrood to rest up a while
his hands were clean and his conscience
was clear and he was respected of all men
for he had made his honor white further
he was a rich man possessor of two good
riiles besides his own lutf-ullahs and that
other the price of the girl which he had
forcibly recovered from the old man under
a machine-gun hail of curses
  he decided that he owed himself a holi-
day after liis weary vigil and accordingly
sprawled his great limbs luxuriously on a
string cot while he opened up negotiations
to trade the two rifles for the highest he
could get over and above their weight in sil-
ver that being the standard price of a good
gun across the border
   his soul was full of content when there
dropped a bolt from the blue news came
with the astonishing mouth-to-mouth tele-
graph of the east that a certain white man
was making cautious inquiries among the
border villages for one yar mahomed
  this was disquieting he had no appre-
hensions about the affair of lutf-ullah for
that had happened on his side of the border
but there had recently been a small matter
of replenishing ammunition and as his rifle
took the  government cartridge what
more natural than that he should have gone
across the border for it true it had been
but a trifling affair-only twenty rounds as
he indignantly recollected but these ac-
cursed feringees were apt to make such a
fuss over trifles
  he decided that he would go up to haz-
war and lie quiet till the white man went

away again not that he was the least bit
afraid but the white men had been known
to raise all sorts of unpleasant complica-
tions by bringing pressure to bear on the
maliks or head men
  in due course renshawe arrived at mun-
rood and was entertained by the malik
his coming had long been expected and
every move of his had been reported but
the old man professed the greatest surprise
and gave flowery expression to the honor it
was to entertain so distinguished-looking a
stranger renshawe gravely partook of the
proffered meal of greasy kid stew squatting
on the floor opposite his host-who of
course did not eat-and conversed on the
probability of the rainfall and the possibil-
ity of the great bazid-khel feud breaking
out again and every imaginable topic ex-
cept that which was uppermost in his mind
it was not till the hoollih had been lit and
passed that he mentioned what he had real-
ly come for for this was the custom
  the wily old malik with the hereditary
suspicion of ages fenced carefully
  yar mahomed yes sahib such a man
did indeed live here but he is now absent
  that is unfortunate for i have jour-
neyed far to have speech with him
  so this is indeed evil luck but a week
ago he was here and is it permissible to
inquire what this matter might be per-
haps a messenger might- it is just pos-
sible if allah wills but who can say
  renshawe had to be careful there was
no means of finding out how much was
known about the image
  well he said it is this i would pur-
chase a certain thing that is in his posses-
sion a tiling that has come from across the
border
  the old man with difficulty restrained a
grin he saw through the whole thing now
this foolish feringee had given the game
away a certain thing from across the bor-
der why of course that would be his ri-
fle such an old affair as that truly these
white men were persistent
  and purchase did the white man
think to throw dust in his eyes thus easily
how childish he was well he would send
a messenger to try and overtake yar ma-
homed but there was no great hope he had
gone to kabul and he traveled fast
  renshawe thanked the crafty old pa-
triarch and presently withdrew he knew
he was lying but one doesnt voice such
adventure
crude accusations across the bonier how-
ever there were other ways men could al-
ways be found renegades or fugitives from
other tribes who would exchange informa-
tion for money
that night yar mahomed re-
ceived a message to the effect that
the unbelieving dog was an officer
of the border police and that he came for
the english lords rille but that yar ma-
homed might rest in peace for the feringee
was open-faced and foolish and would ac-
complish nothing
  but three days later a breathless runner
brought novv that the feringee was even
then making his way to hazwar yar ma-
homed hastily gathered up his gear and
moved far up the mountains to faizkot
leaving information at hazwar that he had
gone west to rohat faizkot was an al-
most inaccessible mountain village and he
had yet to meet the white man who could
follow him in his own mountains
  in a week a rumor came up of a man win-
nowing the villages above hazwar yar
mahomed cursed gutturally this feringee
was not as others he had met he was be-
coming a nuisance in the first flush of
fierce rage his primal impulse was to lie in
wait for him and kill him but he hesitated
at that the killing of a white man brought
certain trouble with the sirfar and the
paying of heavy fines and perhaps white
soldiers quartered in the hill villages and
he knew that his private troubles were not
worth all that to the malika he doubled
back to kurrum
  to detail the long chase that ensued
would fill a book yar mahomed broke
from his more familiar country to the ghii-
sai tribes and from them to the bazid-
khels for the first time in his life be was
forced to admit a touch of admiration for
an unbeliever and with it a feeling some-
thing akin to apprehension crept into his
soul for there was something terrifying
about this tireless silent nemesis
  renshawe stuck doggedly to his quest
cruclly handicapped by the universally in-
stinctive union of the colored man against
the white frequently he lost all trace the
tribesmen lied through long habit and
whether they knew anything about the
matter or no they misdirected him on prin-
ciple-	   
  but by careful analysis and a judicious
  use ol lus keen knowledge of native char-
acter he always eventually picked up the
trail again lately fur a long lime he had
not been able to glean any information at
all the man seemed to have disappeared
into the air and this was because yar ma-
homed recognizing that information as to
his whereabouts leaked from the villages
had embarked on a new plan of camping
out on the mountains alone but ren-
shawe was nearer to him than he imagined
and he became cognizant of the fact with
startling unpleasantness
  as renshawe toiled up a barren slope
doggedly but rather hopelessly out of the
corner of his eye he caught die puff of a
thin feather of smoke that flashed out from
a far ridge instantly he threw himself flat
on his face and at the same instant a thin
whine sang over the place where he had
stood
  the temptation had been too much for
yar mahomed coming over the spur le
had caught sight of his enemy and the swift
access of rage had overcome all i-ihtr con-
siderations the fact that he had lired
from ambush showed what a demoralizing
effect this relentless pursuit was having on
his nerves if such a man could be said to
have nerves
  some inkling of this found it way into
renshawes mind as he swiftly stalked the
spot for he grinned all over his face for the
first time in many dars he considered
himself almost at hand-grips now for
though the spot was empty and there was
no trace on the rocky ground only a few
minutes separated him from the man whom
he had hitherto been regarding as an elusive
fugitive but the sudden shot woke him
up to the fact that he was dealing with a
dangerous enemy
  yar mahomed for his part was thor-
oughly convinced of the fact having once
opened hostilities there would be no more
running away-something which his fierce
soul had rebelled against from the begin-
ning
  the twro men were stalking each other
now yet so many hiding-places did the
mountains offer and so well did each know
how to take advantage of them that it was
not till the second evening that they came
together
  honors fell to the white man-white now
only by courtesy for so sunburnt and gaunt
was his face from exposure and so ragged
the oath by the earth
ii
his khaki shooting-suit that he might easijy
have passed for a gurkha from his own be-
loved hills
  he was cautiously working down a ridge
when his quick eyes trained to the obser-
vation of nature noticed a kite wheeling
lazily in the sky he watched it critically
then he rose with a seraphic grin and drop-
ped swiftly down the ravine woodsmans
deduction had told him that the bird was
watching something alive below alive and
active for it kept its distance had the ob-
ject been sleeping or perhaps dying and
therefore feeble it would have swung much
lower had it been dead the bird would
have settled to feed
   he climbed the other side with eager an-
ticipation just crackling out of his eyes
there would be a fight this man who had
given him such a long chase would surely
fight and though it would have been a
genuine shock to realize it renshawe rev-
eled heathenishly in a good fight
  he peered carefully over the ridge and
almost shouted some two hundred yards
farther from behind an intervening hog-
back rose a thin curl of smoke he ran
forward softly with all the restrained eager-
ness of a panther following a grazing buck
he hurried bending low from rock to rock
craning his neck over each and taking the
craziest chances of making a noise in his
eagerness to get over loose ground but at
the hogback caution returned with in-
finite weariness he edged up to eye-level
his rifle ready for instant action-and then
he boldly stood upright
  a hundred yards further with his back
to him sat a man with a rifle under his
thigh preparing a meal
  renshawes great chest expanded with a
deep breath at last
      he thrust his rifle forward and
      hailed
       ote yar mahomed yield
thee
  and then curiously enough yar ma-
homed acted with the same hereditary in-
stinct that lutf-ullah had shown on a very
similar occasion he took a flying dive for
crr and bulet whizzed past ren-
shawe s head while he was almost yet in the
air
  and some curious impulse common to
the type caused renshawe to throw back
his head and shout with laughter at the
ungainly figure cut by the tall afghan
   he lifted his head a trifle incautiously af-
ter the outburst and an immediate bullet
cutting his hair showed him that his oppo-
nent certainly knew his weapon
  curiously enough again yrar mahomed
once more followed the example set by his
late cousin he fired wildly several times
but not from nervousness or fear he was
consumed with wild rage the fact alone
that he was face to face at last with his per-
secutor was enough to rouse him to fierce
indignation and that he yar mahomed
had been caught by an unbelieving dog of
a feringee was an ineffaceable disgrace
the thought drove him nearly frantic also
he had heard the laugh following on his first
shot and the knowledge that the accursed
feringee mocked him goaded him beyond
all control of himself
  and renshawe perfectly cool and alert
held his fire just as yar mahomed had done
on that previous occasion
  presently a dagger-stroke of thought
struck through the afghans quivering rage
with paralyzing force ammunition this
was ever a scarcity and yar mahomeds
scanty supply had already been much de-
pleted in procuring food during the last
month a swift inspection of the magazine
threw him for an instant into a cold sweat
to be followed immediately after by a fresh
paroxysm of rabid fury- he had only one
cartridge left
  the thought of capture by this accursed
feringee was frenzy he tried to collect
himself to make an end with his last shot
he could do it he couldnt miss at a hun-
dred yards if only he got a grip of himself
but yar mahomed came of a fanatical race
he saw a chance-a poor one snatched at
it fired wildly-and then went ghazi
   which is akin to amok with the difference
that the ghazi has the prophets assurance
of certain paradise if he can but kill one
christian before he dies
  the tension had been too great yar ma-
homed threw away his rifle and rushed up
the slope frothing at the mouth blazing
red from his eyes and howling like a
chained devil
  renshawe stepped out to meet him and
without the least flurry brought the sights
to bear on his broad chest
   if he had not had such a perfect control
of a perfect nerve he might have fired but
as he waited his mind was running freely
ii
adventure
and something out of the centuries of west-
ern civilization came and implanted a vague
impression that there was something of au
unfair advantage in this and hand in hand
with it came the startling anomaly of a
pre-adamite craving to get to grips with the
enemy
  renshawe softly laid down liis rifle and
drew the wicked gurkha kukric of his own
hills from its sheath with a slow grim smile
that left his lips parted in an expression of
fierce eagerness the joy of battle blazed
from his eyes
  now there was by no means anything of
chivalrous foolhardiness in this it had
been demonstrated time and again in the
annals of the british army in india that the
active little gurkhas armed with their hack-
ing blade were more than a match hand to
hand for the big afghans with their stab-
bing kkaibari knife renshawe was cer-
tainly carried beyond all resemblance to his
normal self by the fierce joy that warriors
feel or he might never have taken such a
chance but he felt perfect confidence in his
own phenomenal quickness and trained
muscles against a much bigger and clumsier
opponent and this is the god-given gift to
all natural-born fighting-men-the supreme
confidence of winning that is why they
are fighting-men
  he stepped forward to a level spot and
waited with tense muscles slightly crouched
poised on the balls of his feet and weaving
the terrible curved blade in and out before
him
  at any other time even such a man as
yar mahomed might well have hesitated
and at least fought warily but he was
ghazi he leaped in with a howl and a hiss-
ing stab of his great three-foot blade but
renshawe easily evaded and returned with
a swift swing at the stomach after the gur-
kha manner
  yet the long-limbed fanatic was no nov-
ice at knif e-play with a lightning recovery
he met the blade on his own and whirled
up for another slashing stroke
  renshawe stepped swiftly inside the blow
so that the mans arm jarred on liis shoulder
and at the same time he drove heavily for
the neck and then his heart came up into
his mouth where he could taste it for the
blade caught in the huge iron brooch that
held the afghans sheepskin poshlein to-
gether at the shoulder and twisted from his
hand
  yar mohamed howled aloud with de-
moniac joy and heaved up his arm for a fi-
nal stab renshawes mind worked with
the speed and accuracy of the well-kept
machine that it was in the second that
elapsed between his disastrous stroke and
the ret urn he had rejected half a dozen pos-
sibilities and seized on the one winch would
serve him best and here his jiu-jitsu skill
stood him in good stead
  he leaped up at the raised arm and their
hands met with a soft smack with a
peculiar double grip enclosing hand and hilt
he pressed away the driving stroke that
whizzed by his side like a lightning bolt
  again the same thing happened and
again then renshawe saw his chance and
slipped in close turning his back to his op-
ponent so that the stabbing arm came down
over his shoulder a little farther out and
the elbow would have struck his shoulder
and the swift jerk that he gave would have
snapped it like a clay pipe-stem
  as it was in his anxiety to gtt well within
the blow he had not taken into account tl 
afghans great length of limb the fulcn m
of his shoulder caught the upper part oi the
arm and the snapping wtench only availed
to jerk the great knife from the paralyzed
fingers
it was man against man now
breast against breast trained mus-
cle and phenomenal skill against
brute straigth and berserk fun- their sin-
ews cracked as they strained and stamped
over the broken ground working farther
and farther down the slope
  presently the maniac-light began to de
out of the afghans eyes the fanatical fury
had spent itself and he began to fight with
more cunning while he marveled at this
comparatively small man who stood against
him so evenly as they swung with straining
chests and hissing breath the loose stones
made foothold impossible and presently
they fell to the ground with interlocked
limbs
  there the mad struggle continued they
rolled ever lower and farther neither gain-
ing any marked advantage and both grow-
ing equally spent
  then a final heave carried them both
over a small declivity locked in a single
clawing mass of venom and fight which
struck with a heavy thud and rolled apart
  renshawe struggled slowly to his feet
the oath by the earth

badly shaken and stood panting expecting
the others attack till he saw to his im-
mense relief that the afghan was evidently
as badly jolted as himself for he made no
move to renew the combat
  and then as they glared with bloodshot
eyes and heaving lungs from a nestling
mountain village far below floated the boom
of a gong and the clear call of the muezzin
  ella-a-hi ho allah akhbar alla-a-ah-
god is i he god praise be to god
  renshawe smiled painfully the incon-
gruity of it struck some hidden note of grim
humor
  it is thy time for prayer o mussulman
-perchance the last take it he advised
he felt that he would be glad of the res-
pite
  the sweating mohammedan thought the
same as for prayer-well they were both
out of reach of weapons and the white man
could take no advantage he would show
him and forthwith with superb disdain
he turned his back and faced the west
  hear the voice of god chanted the
muezzin
  and the follower of the prophet knelt and
raised his hands to his ears-and the white
man drew in great life-giving drafts of air
and thanked his own god for the rest
  when the last note had died away from
below the great afghan rose gravely and
surveyed his enemy with a thoughtful look
tinged with a mans admiration for a man
  sahib he said at length what need
that we two slay one another
  none answered renshawe promptly
if thou wilt but deliver what i seek
  the battle-light began to come back in
the others eyes
give thee my rifle nay it is mine to
me by the law of conquest my life first
rifle muttered renshawe wondering-
ly what need have i of thy rifle
what matter is it then that thou hast
followed me for this month past
  the matter of lutf-ullah
  that was across the border flashed yar
mahomed hotly there is no penalty it
was a feud according to our custom
there is no talk of penalty what have
i to do with thy feuds but the matter is
this luti-ullah had with him a sacred
image of the buddha stolen from tibet- it
is this that i seek
  yar mahomeds face flashed again
  na  am i a thief he cried indignantly
if the dog had any image it is surely with
his bones even now
  renshawe looked into his eyes long and
searchingly then he nodded slowly
  true i should have known  he said
it is truce between us
  it is truce repeated yar mahomed
my heart is glad we be men thou and
i
  together they clambered somewhat stiff-
ly up the scene of the late struggle and come
to the little camp and the sight of the pre-
parations reminded yar mahomed of his
need for a meal and rest
  the sahib will eat he invited with
grave courtesy
  renshawe signified his willingness and
squatted down and waited while the af-
ghan kneaded his coarse flour with a little
water and salt and patted the flat unleav-
ened cake between his hands
  when it was roasted in the ashes the af-
ghan broke the cake in two and handed a
half to renshawe with a curious look in his
eyes renshawe received it through the
smoke of the fire and ate
  thereafter the afghan addressed the
white man as brother
      later he accompanied him to the
scene of his blood feud and showed
the piled boulders renshawe set
to work to remove these with some misgiv-
ings it chilled him to think that perhaps
the man had sold before leaving india but
as the bones already picked clean by the
great black ants were disclosed there sat
the beautifully carved figure of dulled silver
in its proper position with the fingers of
the right hand touching the ground in front
of the knee in the prescribed attitude of ta-
king the oath by the earth and the great
emerald winked up at them in the sunlight
from its breast
  hm grunted renshawe that puts
me quits with the tesho-lama then he
looked curiously at yar mahomed
  but the great afghan leaned gaunt and
stolid on his rifle what did he want with
images and stones the dead mans weap-
on was now his it was enough
  they parted at the border after ren-
shawe had shamelessly promised to send
many pounds of  cartridges cunningly
hidden in kerosene oil-cans in flagrant de-
fiance of all government regulations and
treaties
n
adventure
  in the fulfilment of time tie arrived at
darjiling and found his letter the mo-
mentous missive said come but not very
enthusiastically and renshawe thought
for a long time and curiously enough the
more he thought the more certain became
the gradually forming conviction of the past
year that the most wonderful girl was after
all not quite so wonderful as she had at
tiiit seemed and he decided to think a lii-
tle longer-which was a very lucky escape
for him
all of which goes to prove con-
clusively the great truth that there
is after all very little diherencc be-
tween two strong men-though they corn-
from the ends of the earth

oys boys throw them cards to
heligoland and come on its
a new strike
  to eric sark lounging in the
northern light saloon pipe in mouth and
one shoulder planted against the wall as he
absently viewed the pretentious faro games
scattered about in the middle of the place
the words gasped in an excited whisper
came faintly through the board partition
against which he leaned and which sepa-
rated the main room from a smaller and pri-
vate room at the back
  in that private room sark knew that
casino charlie ante baker slim
sullivan and alabama ben were sitting in
at skylimit poker also sark knew the voice
of the man who had rushed in and inter-
rupted them as that of gunboat kane
and he shot a swift glance at his partner
bassett to see if tom had overheard
  lolling a few feet distant against the same
partition tom bassett betrayed his knowl-
edge by no startled movement but the mo-
mentary flash in his eyes told sark that he
was wise bassett scrutinized for one keen
second the faro players at the tables in the
middle of the room fearful lest the too had
overheard but even as he looked he real-
ized that his fears were unfounded that the
distance was too great for the faint whisper
to carry to them
  his eyes came back to sark s
  eric he spoke up abruptly ive fig-
gered out the drift on that upper-tier claim
of ours on adams iiill listen heres how
well work it-or hold on ill draw it for
you
  producing a pencil bassett faced about
on the board partition and began to sketch
imaginary designs sark standing atten-
tive at his elbow nodded and sprayed the
smoke about vet the eyes of neither man
were upon the adams hill designs with
nice discrimination tom had selected for
his drawings a pair of wide boards with a
crack between and through the crack the
partners glimpsed the interior of the private
room
  there in the middle of the floor posed

bent at the hips his legs spread wide one

them casino ante slim and alabama lis-
tened open-mouthed wide-eyed to gun-

casino waved his comrades out
turned up the oil-lamp on the wall
so that it blazed brighter and fol-
lowed through the doonvay in spite of
his precautions with the key tom and eric
heard it grate in the lock as casino slipped
by the back route out of the northern light
  thars whar he fools himself chuckled
bassett in an undertone we know and
we  sure make urgent use of our knowl-
edge but foller casinos cue eric and
eschew the dash walk funereally slow and
whistle the dead march in saul now
raising his voice incisively and tapping the
pseudo designs with an air of finality well
go back to our cabin pardner put this on
paper and scale out the measurements of
the same what do you say
  all right agreed sark casting a last
ealculftbng glance at toms hieroglyphics
it looks good to me
  so the two turned down the smoky in-
terior of the northern light between the
crowded faro roulette and poker tables
pausing quite naturally here and there to
watch for a second the dealers dealing
bank to note the number of the pocket
into which the spinning ivory ball dropped
or to see four aces or a royal flush sweep a
glutted jack-pot they passed nods and
fleeting jokes with many men of their ac-
quaintance who for all they knew might
presently be racing at their heels and finally
lounged sedately out of the front doonvay
  but once outside in the twilight night of
spring sedateness utterly vanished and the
partners raced straight for the riverbank
  we gotta be mighty sprightly eric
confided bassett as they ran fresno
creek aint very far away from dawson-
only about fourteen miles or so if the news
gets spread therell be one rampant rush
and it wront be a long survival-of-the-
fittest stampede with leather lungs and iron
legs winnin out itll be a scrumptious
sprint the hundred-yard man with the
spiked solesll bring home the beans pard-
ner kin you run fourteen miles at one
splurge without get tin spiflication of the
system
  i can if you can declared sark but
id sooner pole it than sprint it arent you
going by the yukon river
  nope the land trails shorter well
make it rapider casino and his bunch is
certain strides ahead of us now thats the
way theyll go sure down the yukon and
wreu take a cut-off and beat-
   bassett did not finish his sentence for the
foremost of five running figures swinging
out of one of the side streets of the water-
front collided breast to breast with him
tom staggered sidewise doing a crawl
stroke in the atmosphere to recover his
balance and at the same time spouting
trenchant phrases denouncing the others
stupidity
  shut up tom admonished sark
this is no time to air yourself like that
youve got a bellow like the trump of doom
and youll rout out all dawsons living and
dead shut up i say
  you aint-got hit puffed tom ask
-the other feller-whars the-fire
  the other man referred to had likewise
recoiled he came forward again rubbing
his shoulder and breathing strange epigrams
very softly spoken into the fog
  i agree with your partner stranger he

adventure
complained you aint got no call to
clamor aloud and make a fuss over an acci-
dent you were runnin like you might have
been biddin the police good-by yourself
where in tarnation you both goin so fast
sark caught something familiar
in the tone and he stepped close to
scan the speakers face and the faces
of the other four
  hello casino he greeted hello
ante gunboat slim and alabama i the
same salute to you where in thunder you
going so fast
  we were chasm one of my dogs ex-
plained casino hastily the brute swiped
a big chunk of bacon you seen him
no returned eric dryly what kind
of dog
  malemut casino blurted a lop-
eared malemut with a yellow mane and
trace-galls on his flanks
  never saw a hair of him sark reassert-
ed but well sure help you find him
no no dont bother boys i got
enough help to bag him now he must have
scooted down along the riverbank well
just sneak after him till we get him cor-
nered
  all right then but tom and ill just
amble along behind and see the fun
dont dont i say casino vehe-
mently objected shaking warning hands
dont you do it boys youll stampede
the beggar and well never recover our
grub
  oh we aint goin close enough for that
casino put in bassett well stay here
at the waters edge and wait while you scout
along the bank
  as tom spoke he and eric were per-
sistently following in spite of casinos ges-
tured refusals of their company
  casino stopped and stared at them sus-
piciously then he wheeled and ran head-
long for the river
  theyre wise lie yelled at his friends
run men run
  after him lurched his four comrades and
after them pounded sark and bassett
and as they rushed along they heard the
thud of other running feet down dawsons
river streets and along the yukon bank
itself
  told you youd rout out the whole city
reproached sark your bellowings spread
the news
  huh tom grunted as if it wasnt
spread before ever see a stampede every-
body wasnt in on if theyre not in at the
head theyre in at the tail and squeezin up
the middle every man thinks hes the only
one as knows he snickers to himself that
hes got a dead-sealed secret padlocked in
his lonely breast but when it comes to the
lightin-out poiut theys others at the same
stunt swarms of em jumpin out of the
grass like skeeters in jooly jist look at the
roisterin riverbank thar and see if im
not right
sark raised his eyes as he sprinted
and saw the shore ahead lined with
men pulling poling-boats off the
muck other men were already afloat
moving like phantoms iu the haze as ihey
worked their crafts while beyond these
so far out as to be invisible the creak of
oars and the splash of poles told of more
boats in the lead of the race
  halpunes a pal of gunboats and hes
put gunboat wise aint he chuckled bas-
sett harshly o course gunboat thought
as he was the only man and that the news
wouldnt circulate till momin but how
many did halpune put wise before he grad-
uated gunboat only a few dozen that
aint many oh no wonder if any of
ems confiscated our boat lucky we are
pardner here she is all splattered and de-
filed with the mucky mukluks of casinos
bunch clamberin out over her to launch
their own yes thats their boat that last
one it laid beside ours but never mind
well jist beat em acrost for that shove
her out in their track
  the groove where casinos craft had been
dragged out showed deep and oozy in the
mud sark and bassett wiggled their own
boat over into it and launched off it was
june high-water on the yukon and swollen
with the hoods of big tributaries such as the
klondike the sixtymile the stewart the
white and the pelly the river was running
strong
  some of the leading boats coujd be heard
through the haze speeding down with the
swift current towards fresno creek which
flowed into the yukon some fourteen miles
below dawson but these were ones whose
early start assured them time enough to get
in on the creek by the water route
  the men in the later-launched boats had
no good chance of overtaking the leading
stolen thunder

ones and they apparently knew it they
did not risk everything on the attempt
they were heading across towards the west
bank of the yukon where the trail from
dawson city to glacier creek up in the
sixtymile country began
  the route by land was shorter than the
route by water and in case fresno should
be staked well up to the head when they
arrived they would not be compelled to
waste time traveling the whole creek length
before grabbing some ground this was the
plan of the partners and they could now see
that this was the plan of casino also
  give up his dash down-stream com-
mented bassett staring after casinos craft
which was moving faster than theirs seen
thar was too many ahead and ill be
bludgeoned if he aint goin to beat us acrost
at that hows he doin it eric
  oars i guess sark enlightened oars
as well as the poles our oars too tom if
anybody should float down the river and
ask vou i left them in our boat this morn-
ing
  the sartorial skunk thats casino
for you if he hadnt a had poles even
hed a apologetically appropriated ours
and we could a paddled with our hands
look at casino and company puttin on
speed hittin one hundred and thirty-six
or tharabouts to the minnit but jist wait
till we thump the trail eric well show
em what a combined cross-country hurdle
and obstacle race is well jerk casino and
his crooked cronies along so fast that their
heelsll be back on quebec creek when their
heads is up on fresno go to it pardner
tut a grouch into your pole
  im putting all ive got into it com-
plained sark but this vessel poles like
noahs ark shes waterlogged tom
thats what makes her drive so hard im
afraid well have to be getting a new boat
this spring
  huh new boat what was she but a
new boat when i bought her off durslane
in the fall
  but shes waterlogged all the same
youve got eyes havent you bottom
must be punkv the waters nearly up to
my ankles here in the bow
  yes and its over my ankles here in the
stern but t  swear the bottom was sound
when i bought her mebbe the sun opened
her seams some wait till i feel a bit
  tom stooped and plunged his arm up to
the elbow in the muddy water scraping his
fingers over the boats bottom
  malice aforethought he exploded
cuts eric ax cuts and a belt-ax by the
size of em thars some more of casino
  the beggar does he want to drown
us
  oh no danger of that theys just
dinky leetle chinks not enough to swamp
and destroy us but jist enough to filter in a
half-ton of water while were crossin and
impede us like a boat-load of lead
  the beggar i say well move across
about as fast as a hearse
  no we wont either pole back pard-
ner and well git another boat
they dug in their poles with all
their strength brought the boat to a
stop and then drove it madly back
towards the east bank of the yukon the
river was a mile wide at this point the
partners were only an eighth of a mile
out and they were not long reaching the
shore
  they did not stop to pull up their craft
but leaped as soon as it struck the shallows
the water splashed them to the waist and
the mud threatened to mire them com-
pletely yet other boats afloat or in the act
of getting afloat from the bank paid them
no attention the minds of the owners took
cognizance of nothing but the stampede so
sark and bassett floundered out unaided
and gained the muck-trampled shore
  the pernicious parasite gritted sark
anathematizing casino while he slapped
the water from his thighs he knew there
was no chance of his leading the land race
to fresno if we were in at the start so he
cut off our competition back of the ears and
left us cold at the post well never catch
him now tom
  mebbe not doubted bassett squint-
ing wryly at the mist which hid the mile-
distant west bank but well make a te-
nacious try for it stay here till i beg
borrer or steal somethin that floats
  like a wallowing hippopotamus tom
ploughed down the muddy bank casting
covetous eyes on many a craft whose owners
ominously warned him off until finally he
ran into a swede longshoreman disembark-
ing part of the cargo of a grounded river
steamer from a boat the size of a scow
  here ole i want that boat bassett
informed im goin acrost the yukon
i 
adventure
twenty-five dollars is the hire hurry up
throw out them boxes and bundles
  the swede longshoreman who had no
interest in stampedes gazed at him ox-like
  ay lank ay ban batter have fifty he
boosted
   you usurer but im the goat this trip
i kint altord to kick fifty it is ole git
a twist on eric hey hustle here help us
stevedore this stuff
  out into the mud the boxes and bundles
flew in a reckless deluge the unwieldy
boat the size of a scow was warped around
and poked clear of the shallows its long
sweeps came into play and after fifteen
minutes of straining and heaving on the
part of all three men the craft reached the
farther hore it rode in on the whirl of an
eddy swung around stove two small be-
lated poling-boats just about to land stuck
its nose fast in the bank and spilled sark
and bassett ashore over its bow
  i dunno how youll ever git back ole
with this flood runnin was toms fare-
well but if you kint why tail in on the
stampede yon cargoll keep all right
their mishap had lost the part-
ners a great deal of time the main
rush was miles ahead of them
only the stragglers were here at the rear
but their feet once upon the well-known
glacier creek trail tom and eric pro-
ceeded to make up lost time in the first
two miles they caught and passed a doen of
these stragglers as if they were standing
still alter that the partners ran practically
alone and up to the end of the first hour
when they crossed the headwaters of que-
bec creek they saw no more stampedcrs
   casinos certainly hikin em along ob-
served bassett as he and sark paused a few
moments at quebec creek to breathe them-
selves the bunch is runnin mighty com-
pact or wed a caught a dozen or so of em
he knows were in no ways what youd call
quitters so hes takin no chances hes
hittin only the high spots and never lookin
round
   thats just what weve got to do too
puffed sark weve covered the first
seventy-five yards of your hundred-yard
sprinttom the home stretch of the last
twenty-five yards is ahead of us now you
got your second wind
  sure and im keepin my third in my
pocket go ahead if we dont tag some-
body soon ill hang up my racin mukluks
and leave the klondike trails alone
  fresh from their brief rest they dashed
on through the ckmk spring air the
glacier creek trail roughly followed the low
di ide ling between swede creek and the
 ukon river valleys flooded with hill
water stretched away on either hand
wedges of wild fowl drove over the watery
wastes flowers new-sprung from the
snows raised their blossoms by the trail-
side and animal life scurried in the under-
brush but these attributes of spring did
not smite on the consciousness of the men
their minds were focused on fresno
   they sped viciously blindly reeking in a
sweat bath flinging ridge and valley bluff
and gulch scrub timber and niggerhead
swamp behind they passed the dwindling
upper reaches of another small stream be-
yond quebec creek and a couple of miles
beyond that struck the extreme tip of
fresno
  now the -wisdom of following the land
route became apparent for fresno creek
although its main trend was almosl due
west curved south before reaching the
glacier creek trail paralleled it for some
distance and met it half-way back to que-
bec creek it was as if while the stampede
was racing for the creek the creek was
twisting back to meet the stampede
 as they plunged down the fresno
bench-ground at a jarring run the
partners felt the disappointed
qualms of the stampeder who arrives too
late here there was little mist fires
blazed down all the length of the valley and
fires at the head meant that the creek was
located from the mouth up in the creek
itself poling-boats splashed along and
clamor dinned out on the shores
  staked to the pearly sky-line eric
groaned bassett lugubriously thars
the highest claim right below us casino
the whelp put us outa uie runnin with so
simple a tool as a belt-ax
  yes and when i find him tom ill take
his belt-ax out of his belt and sink it in his
perverted scalp sark threatened
  youll have some hunt then hes
likely staked down about the mouth and
hell be back in dawson recordin before
you git to him but whats wtong with that
geezer below us whats he punchin the
atmosphere full of holes for
stolen thunder

   driving his stakes isnt he
  no by thunder hes wavin on us
that means open ground yet quick
buck-jump it pardner or well lose out
some galootll roll over the ridge and beat
us to it
  in ten-foot leaps the pair bounded
down the hillside on to the creek claim of the
man who was beckoning them
  casino barked sark glaring at the
mans face revealed by the fires glow
  sure i was scared you wouldnt see or
hear me and go past theres a thousand
feet left above me kick in sudden boys
its the last
  god bless you casino sighed sark
you benign repentant beggar i forgive
you belt-ax and all
   oh you didnt need to worry yourselves
hoary-headed over that little stunt grinned
casino i heard a duffer say once at the
omar opery in dawson that all was fair in
love and war i can go him one better and
add stampedes i knew you two had the
grit and gumption to lead the land race if
 let you so i didnt let you savvy
but poverizin little good it did me after all
you see where im planted
  what happened to you asked tom
 why aint you staked away down-creek
  you know that northerly feeder of
quebec creek well what did we do in the
mist but take it for a pup of fresno and go
pikin down her lost four miles before we
plumped on to our mistake and cut across
the ridges lost four miles and the chance
to stake next discovery but theres no
use lamentin me and my friends are
lucky to get in at all and youre just as
lucky ante gunboat slim and alabama
are below me and youd belter whack in
excuse me for not helpin you boys but i
can t move off my claim till you get staked
for fear some one jumps it
  whats your number there asked bas-
sett
k twenty-three above its supposed to
   its halpunes strike aint it
        four-dollar pans but mebbe
that s hot air
  whered halpune stake demanded
casmosmn   thc ground next
   about half way down the claims run
to twenty-four below at fresnos mouth
 near bo you boys must sure be pretty-
plumb on the truth when you count yours
twenty-four and twenty-five above
good luck to you boys and glad you got
in even if i did take a swipe at you on the
way thats all in the game mebbe next
stampede there is ill be the one to get a
jolt from you
       laughing in friendly fashion
casino now that his uppermost
boundary bordering on sarks lower
one was safe strode down through the
scrub on his claim to hold communication
with ante and gunboat below him and
gather the latest news sark went on with
his staking pacing off five hundred feet
which gave the location of his upper stakes
and bassetts lower ones
  not such a greedy gink arter all com-
mented tom as they whittled smooth the
faces of their corner stakes to receive the
numbers he might a tried to blanket
these two claims wonder if the creekll
run rich eric
  i hardly think it calculated sark and
im not banking on it in the first place i
dont for a minute believe that four-dollar
pan guff thats always the cry twenty-
five cent pans grow into four- and five-dollar
pans mighty quick when theres a rush on
  i dont see halpune swaggering round
anywhere hes a gambler like casino and
if hed have struck it that big hed be
snooping around up-creek and down buy-
ing all the cheap claims he could get his
claws on and in the second place if the
creek shows up anything in placer ill take
my oath itll prove patchy fact is part-
ner fresno never did look to me like a
placer proposition whats more it looks
to me just like what it always did it looks
like a quartz proposition just cast your
eye over that ridge back of us tom and
see if it doesnt
  by thunder youre right eric ex-
claimed bassett running a speculative eye
over the broken ragged contour of the
ridge thats quartz formation sure the
fiamelight shows the outcrops mebbe
weve had all our sprintin for nothin
dont know tom but well soon see
you tend to your corner stake and we ll
sink a hole on the common line of the two
claims and prove them up together it
shouldnt take long by the dip of the
creek bank its shallow bedrock here i
know fresno ive prospected it before
adventure
bedrocks not very deep any place and just
where i stand ill bet its not over ten or
twelve feet down you go and finish your
staking and then come and help me scrape
the spring rains and hoods had
left the ground soft and mucky
sark found little difficulty in sink-
ing a prospect hole with a rude wooden
shovel carved out of a willow slab with his
hunting-kriife when he was down three
feet bassett came back from the staking
and aided him by digging with a long pole
used like a crowbar they wenc down
another three feet and erics wooden
shovel gritted into gravel
  got it asked tom
  yes i knew it was shallow bed-rock
there must be a fine thick pay-streak here-
abouts that is if there is any pay in it
well possess that knowledge in a min-
nit pardner we aint got any pan to sam-
ple but here fill my hat
  tom handed down to sark a nice new
stetson with which he had adorned him-
self at the coming of spring and eric with-
out qualm or scruple loaded it up with
handfuls of the dirty gravel he shoved the
hat up to tom and clambered out after it
his face and clothes plastered with the
sticky overburden together they went
down to the creek edge eric twisted a
few dried willow branches into a heap and
touched a match to them for a better light
than the semi-luminous yukon night af-
forded while bassett dipped the hat care-
fully into the shore ripples of the stream
  with a slow circular motion tom washed
out the light muck so that it floated away
discoloring more deeply the already mired
creek water by degrees he wore down the
hatful-the new stetson bravely upholding
its reputation as waterproof-until he had
only the desired residue left then with a
twist of the wrist he flirted the remaining
water out and showed up a smattering of
black sand speckled with shining yellow
grains across the bottom of the hat
  thunderation-pay ejaculated sark
as the firelight gleamed on the yellow
grains rich pay tom
  sure nodded bassett scraping to-
gether the little heap of golden particles
two dollars eric if theys a speck a
two-dollar pan bonafide and indisputable
weve got it arter all our doubtin
  and  lose tom my judgments poor
its something more than a quart proposi-
tion wonder if halpunes sample ran as
high
  it certainly didnt or hed a bin out
buyin thats our game eric we got a
foundation to go on and we sure gutta clean
up the creek my claims twenty-five
above casino says the string runs to
twenty-four below at the mouth that
with discovery is fifty claims altogether
we own two already well buy the hull re-
mainin forty-eight and make twenty-five
million dollars in one night
  but remember it hasnt changed its
looks it still looks quartzy reminded
sark liis innate caution getting the better
of liis enthusiasm and even if it is all
placer it might prove patchr
  tah things aint very patchy whar
two-dollar pans is panned first crack
even if it should be itll average up look
at our two claims worth half a million
dollars apiece if theyre worth an ounce
the otherll average up to that ligger on the
basis of this hat if some slump under
othersll produce over
  twenty-five million dollars eric is the
value of this valley and we kin buy it for a
hundred thousand dont the opportunity
smite you blind and give you a gone feelin
in the pit of your stomach it does me
but we gotta shake our nerves together and
act abrupt or pricesll go up i hear ca-
sino and his friends talkin down yonder
now hes cornin back he mustnt come
on our claim we must meet him on his
own ground shuffle yourself and help me
dump the muck back into the prospeck
hole
bassett crammed his wet stet-
son still containing the gold sam-
ple out of sight into liis pocket
kicked the willow smudge into the creek
and ran with sark to the hole hastily they
shoveled back the overburden tramped it
smoothly down and hurried along the creek
limits to meet casino crossing the boun-
dary of liis and antes claim
  finish stakin boys casino greeted
yes all plumb lines and stakes in plain
sight bassett told him and we also
panned a sample
  haw haw laughed casino that s
a good one howdyouget to bed-rock so
sudden dive
  we also panned a sample repeated
stolen thunder

bassett imperturbably i come out flat-
footed and tell you so casino but mind
im not tellin you what kind of sample
good or bad we sampled thars the
point so dont you say in the days to come
that we made a secret prospeck and acted
underhand without due diffusion of our
knowledge we sampled i say and were
out to buy
  then take care you dont get stung
cautioned casino promptly i just found
out somethin ante tells me the words
come up that halpunes four-dollar pans
contained twenty cents what do you know
about that i think were in bad boys
i wish id never started on this stampede
ive blunted my belt-ax on your boat-
bottom and jiggled my heart down into my
stomach all for nothin
  jist the same since eric and mes here
were takin a gamblers chance tom an-
nounced were goin to buy some claims
in fact every claim thats for sale your
claim for sale casino
  sure if you want it bad but dont you
make a bluff with me about the creek bein
worth while ive seen you at the gam-
blin game before ive seen you buy whole
creeks that you never sampled at all doz-
ens of them and id make a blatant bet
that you never squared yourselves on any
one of them you havent had time to sam-
ple anyway and where are your shovels
you sure didnt get a chance to bring them
with you- what did you dig your prospect
hole with-your hands what did you
pan your sample with-your boot bah
you cant bamboozle me you hadnt a
tarnation tool with you why tom you
havent even a hat
  never mind that casino whats your
claim worth
  well my friends down there ante gun-
boat slim and alabama just said haphaz-
ard that it nught be worth fifteen hundred
dollars as a suburban lot mighty scornful
they were of its resident propensities 
b yu elve hundred offered
  then ill take two thousand grinned
casno cunningly mebbe vou fellows
know more n i think so ill just play safe
you can have it as i state without me
nctr	n n two thousand dollars
r casino stuck to his figure despite
bassett s haggling until tom handicapped
by the necessity of quick action had to
yield
   ail right two thousand it is but gun-
boat ante alabama and slim has all got to
sell at the same price stipulated tom
they dont boost me no more
   oh two thousandll tickle them most
crazy smiled casino i know that by
their remarks about suburban properties
the aint much for the simple life those
guys ill just hail ante to summon them
all up
      inside of twenty minutes sark
and bassett had bought the five
claims and the bills of sale were
made over these bills of sale had a mone-
tary as well as a documentary value and
though scribbled with pencil on scraps of
paper each was sound as a bond and good
for two thousand dollars in dawson city
   using this same class of currency the
partners then went down the creek on the
same mission the sale of claims twenty-
three twenty-two twenty-one twenty
and nineteen above hastened the sale of
the others it set the pace and the price
by morning the partners had purchased
everything in sight clear to fresnos
mouth
   halpune was the only man who succeeded
in holding them up but the fact that he
finally sold discovery a thousand foot
claim and one below discover- which as
the discoverer he was privileged by law to
locate for five thousand dollars each showed
tom and eric how inflated was the four-
dollar pan report nevertheless their own
two-dollar pan loomed large on their finan-
cial horizon and they chetjfully paid
  nowy gloated tom at dawn we own
the creek twenty-five million dollars its
worth and it cost us only one hundred and
two thousand dollars youre the hardiest
member of the firm eric and its up to you
to go to dawson and record you kin
borrer a boat from some of the vendors and
go up the  ukon ill borrc-r another and
row back to our claims im tired walkin
and thar   steal an hours sleep hire a
hand and git through that pay-streak while
you re gone well know how thick it is
when you come back youd better bring
tagish jim and a dozen or a dozen and a
half of the chilcats with you to prove up
the rest of the holdins thingsll sure
assume gigantic proportions here and weu

adventure
need that many at the start whether well
need more remains to be seen
  that evening at the hour of dark al-
though since the endless day was now on the
yukon there was no real dark eric sark
poled back up the fresno on his return trip
from dawson in his poling-boat working
with him was the chilcat foreman tagish
jlm and behind in more poling-boats were
sixteen more chit cats sun-smoked huge-
muscled men giants of the open fit engines
of toil to tear up the stubborn creek limits
and wrest from the golden gravels bassetts
twenty-five million dollars
  the boats were beached on twenty-four
and iwenty-five above the chilcats
leaped swiftly out and began to kindle a
long oval tire in the fashion they had
learned of white men whereon to cook their
evening meal sark looked around for his
partner and discovered him smoking quietly
on the edge of the prospect hole which was
now enlarged to the proportions of a shaft
  what depths bed-rock tom was his
first anxious question
  twelve feet basset answered
pay-streaks slx feet thick then hows
it panning now
  jist the same
  fine glad to hear that partner i
been a little worried you know i made
something of a discovery in dawson a dis-
covery i didnt somehow like tom
  bassett twisted around on the edge of the
shaft took his pipe from his lips and gazed
fixedly at sark
  what was it he demanded
  you remember what we heard through
the crack in the wall in the northern light
we heard gunboat tell the rest that hal-
pune had recorded just as the recording-
office closed todays the twelfth that
was yesterday the eleventh well the
mining records dont say so i looked when
i recorded what we bought and when i
came to get the transfer of halpunes i
found he had recorded his discovery and
one below discovery on the tenth
  he did eh mused bassett then
that fits in with a discovery ive made my-
self ive found out eric that the date on
the location notices on every claim weve
bought is june the tenth
  tarnation tom i was suspicious as
soon as i saw it only i thought there
might have been some mistake but the
date of halpunes recording and the date
on the notices sure cant both be mistakes
theres only one thing that can mean
  only one thing pardner them claims
was all measured out and staked the day
before the stampede started casinos the
man as did it you didnt notice anythin
pecooliar about the names of the claim
owners did you when you was giltin things
fixed up
  i noticed that they were all casinos
close friends every hard-bitten beggar of
them that struck me as rather funny
too
  it was part of the plan eric casinos
worked a colossal come-on and we fell for
it ii tell you of another discovery i made
while you was gone i discovered that the
claims we staked was salted salted on the
boundary line jist whar two pardner vouid
nacherally sink their prospeck hole
salted tom but there youre wrong
there you sure touch my pride no man
can sell me ground thats been dug before
without me knowing it jll take my altar
oath that nobody had put shovel into the
muck of that prospect hole before mine
im always on my guard against that trick
the stuff we panned was there by nature 
no it wasnt neither it was planted
but wouldnt somebody have to dig to
plant it
  nope they tunneled from the river
yes and it full of water i guess not
they tunneled before thar was any
water bassett calmly explained tun-
neled when it was frozen now do you
savvy the pav-streak we struck wasnt no
pay-streak at all it was gravel shoveled
in thar and sowed with a few ounces of
fortymile or sixtymile or stewart river
gold ive got it all in my pocket and i
know whereof  speak but if youre any-
wav doubtful come and have a look at the
shaft
bassett plucked a burning stick
from the chilcats fire for a torch
and lighted the way he thrust the
torch into the open shaft whose black
mouth yawned with a twelve-foot yawn
and eric climbed down on the rude pole
ladder made of a small tree trunk with
many limb crotches to look at tin level
of his head he saw what was beyond denial
the old workings of a tunnel driven in from
the fresnos bed the fact that it was so
low down suggested that it had been driven
stolen thunder

in time of frost and the settling of the oozing
earth leaving a gap at the tunnel roof sup-
plied the proof
  it sure was a pippin of a plan tom
admired eric climbing out again and a
well-matured pippin at that
  yep agreed bassett so ripe it was
rotten to the core casinos some con-
scientious artist eh jist made one slip
forgot to date the location notices one day
ahead you see he must a prepared
this salt not long before the ice-run and
cooked up the stampede to suit his
games a lot like checkers pardner when
the plays through you kin look back and
see the moves you didnt see before
  casino chose his ground chose the
man to make the strike and chose the
members to compose the rush then he
had halpune record and watched for a
chance to spring the discovery stuff on us
if the chance hadnt a come in the north-
ern light it would a come in the moose-
horn or the polaris or down by some
bushes on the river bank or out behind a
bale of goods on the steamer landin jist
wherever we happened to be and oppor-
tunities looked good but the wherever
turned out to be the northern light
  casino knowed blame well whar we
was loungin and he knowed blame well we
could hear and see through that crack
hence the tableau they put on but it was
well acted eric we got to admit that it
makes me laugh when i think of it it was
thunderin well acted
  oh yes tom and so was the collision
stunt in the street and the waterlogged boat
on the  ukon river there were no black-
flies on that
  no sir it was all in the program a
comedy in four acts and i dunno how many
scenes all arranged even to the two last
claims saved for us
  alightn t casino have got slipped up
there mightnt a couple of outsiders-for
you know there were outsiders vainly tail-
mg m on the stampede-have pounced on
that ground
  dont you ever dream it pardner no
outsider could v got that casino and his
tour pals next him would a shifted the
stakes of the five claims so as to blanket that
one thousand feet and reserve it till we
showed up thars no use prevaricatin or
equivocatm about it to ourselves we was
the ones destined to buy and we bravely
bought my respeck for that geezer ca-
sinos increasin every day eric hes
raoren a conscientious artist hes a deep
student of human nature he was aware
of our frailties and our love of lucre he
knowed as sure as the yukon summers
back agin that wed buy the creek if we
struck any kind of showin he seen us do
it many a time and he knowed wed do it
once too often
  well weve gone and done it once too
often chuckled sark mirthlessly and
casinos pocketed the money wonder
what he paid each man to run in the salted
stampede
  twenty-five dollars and the fun of it
hazarded tom mebbe fifty dollars at
the outside
  call it fifty then that would be forty-
six men to pay not counting himself
twenty-three hundred dollars to pay out
and he got one hundred and two thousand
in hes made a haul of only ninety-nine
thousand seven hundred dollars thats
not much tom
  not much eric and we aint paid
much for them suburban lots only the
said one hundred and two thousand thats
not what youd call prodigal its only
moderate but listen the play aint
completed the checkers is done all right
and weve lost our last king but the check-
erboards one as you turn over to play a
different game on the other side its our
throw now come back with me on to this
precipitous ridge behind our claims ive
still got another discover- aint uncovered
yet i wanta show it to you
     tom stamped out the torch and
strode off through the hall-gloom
sark followed him over ragged tim-
ber growth and rough boulders up on to the
steep of the hill there bassett paused
scanning the top of the ridge and feeling
with his fingers for one of the prominent
outcrops which they both had noticed the
night before from the creek limits he
found the place he sought kicked some dirt
awray and flashed the flame of a sulphur
match upon the rock face
  look he urged you vowed the
creek seemed quartz what do you thinka
that
  sark stared through the brief flame-flare
and his eyes strained and became fixed in
the circle of faint illumination there showed

adventure
a wide quartz vein three feet across its
seams plastered with gleaming gold
  by the spooks of the sundowns gasped
sark his breath catching in his throat with
a sharp click thats a ledge to live and
die on tom have you staked her
  no i waited till you come with the
chilcats i aint no man to move contrary
to the law you and me had already staked
claims on this creek what kind-a claims
nobody could say if the matter popped up
for jurisdiction because the hull thing
was a salt you see we couldnt prove
placer or pay-streak and you sure kint
stake twice on the same creek so if our
twenty-four and twenty-five above hap-
pened to be rooled on as quartz our stakin
on this ledge would be void and wed lose
the hull thing
  casino and the rest of his bunch is in the
same box theyre celebratin at his camp
over thar and dunno anythin about it but
they soon will know then youll see don-
ned sackcloth and ashes hear lamentation
and gnashin of teeth and mebbe stop a few
throwed stones with your ribs eric they
wont like it a leetle bit when they see the
chilcats occupyin ground on our behalf
dont let the beggars know its done at
alii i wouldnt if id made the discovery
casinos been so sufferin smart just
have tagish jim and the rest sneak along
the ridge and locate these on the side
kint be done partner tom pointed
out its too light thars no dark at
night now its only twilight and a mighty
radiant twilight at that jist like a dawn
thats goin to break all the time but never
quite pulls it off you kin see birds on that
ndge from casinos camp and casino cer-
tainly wont miss spottin them six-foot
chilcats he aint no ways short-sighted
you want to kind of rub it into him eh
-tom
  thats what i want to do rub it in
with sandpaper and turpentine for an
astringent hell git a touch of his own
liniment and well see how he likes it
come on back to the fire and ill put tagish
jim wise concernin what hes to do
  as tom came up and beckoned tagish
jim arose from his men about the oval of
red coals
  what um want now he grinned
quartz claims tagish bassett ex-
plained tersely that ridge you savvy
send the men to stake from the mouth of
fresno up the lower ones kin go in boats
the middle ones kin run down the upper
ones kin walk i want em all to stake at
one time within about an hour and git
back here as soon as they stake you stake
the last claim here at the head yourself
git me
  get all right grunted tagish his eyes
lighting at the chance of some actionso
soon want um claims measured well
  yours  do the restll do roughed out
fifteen hundred feet square five hundred
steps the seventeen of youll fill the
string eric and me grubstake you sawy
you stake for us now start em out
quick
tagish jim moved silently to the
fire explained to his men what was
required of them and told them off to
row run or walk the ones who would
stake half way down at once trotted across
the creek limits sark helped those who
were to go down to the mouth of fresno
push off their boats and drift away then
he followed the remainder who with bas-
sett at their head giving further directions
to tagish jim were climbing the ridge
  tagish you go ahead and stake this
directed tom when they reached the top
eric and me dassent put a finger in it
we have staked somethin down thar we
dunno whether its a quartz claim placer
claim or dredgin limit but we re iaw-
abidin men and we live up to the letter of
the minin regulations youre runnin the
hull show and if anybody happens along jist
tell em so that ground under your feet
is worth twelve thousand dollars if its worth
a disfigured cent you kin drive your dis-
covery stake right thar whar that out-
crop is
  methodically tagish jim went about the
business first of all he drove his dis-
covery stake at the spot bassett indicated
then he paced off seven hundred and fifty
feet along the ledge on each side of the dis-
covery post and at these points drove posts
numbers one and two
  at right angles to the line between posts
one and two and beginning at the posts
themselves he paced the distance to the
boundary of the already staked claims on
the creek limits this distance was not
great because the limits commenced to
slope almost from the fresnos brink with a
sharp incline to strike the ridge which
stolen thunder

formed the bench ground it was only one
hundred and eighty feet the rest of the
quartz claim lay upon the other side of the
location line but there was no need to
pace that it was a simple matter of sub-
traction so tagish w-ent back and with a
stub of a pcncil scrawled the inscriptions on
his stakes
  the inscription upon the first post he had
driven read
discovery fost
  that upon number one and two posts
was
quartz claim-tagish jim-june th
-
  the figures  represented the number
of feet lying to the left of the location line
the figures s the number lying to the
right thus although the claim had no
stable boundaries tagish jim held in his
own incontestable right a plot of ground
containing fifty-one and two-thirds acres a
square plot in dimensions though corru-
gated as to surface
  sitting smoking upon a huge outjutting
boulder on the ridge sark and bassett
watched tagish complete the staking
when the chilcat had inscribed he took
his ax and began to blaze more open his
location line below him another chilcat
was working at the same thing and belowr
that one dim in the hazy distance and
moving like gnomes on the face of the
ridge other chilcats staked other claims
  the hours about up announced sark
glancing at his watch they ought to be
all on the job now wonder how long itll
be before casino sees them
  he has seen em declared tom who
had been keeping an ear trained on the
creek limits hear that rumpus in the
scrub hes cornin on the jump
bin a moment the partners could
see several figures rushing up from
casinos camp where all the members
of the salted stampede were holding a jovial
session casino himself was in the lead
with ante gunboat slim and alabama
straining after him stumbling over rocks
logs stumps and crashing through patches
ol dense undergrowth
  hey you yelled casino catching sight
of sark and bassett and panting up to them
what in tarnations afoot chilcat after

chilcat slips by us down-stream and chilcat
after chilcat runs by us over our claims
makin for yon ridge theyre workin
there now a whole string of them like as if
they were stakin whats in the air
  ask tagish jim thar suggested bas-
sett were not doin this he is
  whats up tagish demanded casino
shouting at the chilcat who was hewing
about a hundred yards down his location
line
  quartz grunted tagish phlegmatic-
ally and without turning from his work
  quartz casino echoed then i was
right i thought in my own mind the
cursed creek looked more like quartz than
placer didnt you sark didnt you
bassett
  we sure did the partners agreed
  and wrhat kind of showin has the chil-
cat got wheres his discovery stake
right back of you thar behind that
outcrop wait its a fair showin ill
flash it up for you bassett stepped
across kicked the loose dirt off the quartz
ledge and flared a match over the bared
vein
  thunderation screeched casino
fair showin itll run four hundred dol-
lars to the ton look at it boys seams of
gold half an inch wide
  up behind casino leaning over his back
and shoulders lying affectionately upon
his neck crowded his four comrades so
magnificent was the showing that it left
them well-nigh dumb they could gap
nothing coherent of comment or description
they could only breathe forth unintelligible
monosyllabic imprecations and stare wide-
eyed at the ledge
  stake boys stake fast as flesh and
bloodll let you casino exhorted heaving
the quartette off his back im goin in
next tagish
  no you aint casino differed bassett
catching him by the arm and whirling him
about in his first stride that ground next
tagish is staked
  tell me where ill stake then implored
casino frantically whered you stake
yourself
  i aint staked i had already staked on
this creek and by that action i surrendered
my rights so did eric so did you and
ante gunboat slim and alabama
  w-what that vein there spillin over
splendiferous with gold and reachin clean
	adventure
to the creek mouth by the run of the ridge sure the chilcat admitted
and we cant stake it- 	told you where to stake didnt thev
no if it could a bin staked bv a sure	y
former staker on fresno i sure would a
done it this afternoon
  oh its your discovery is it snarled
casino a cold gleam of dawning under-
standing lighting his features you found
this nice little mint this afternoon
  sure nodded bassett huntin a tree
trunk for a shaft ladder it looked good
on top of the two-dollar pan find so  froze
on to it
  that was mighty considerate of you
wasnt it casino gritted menacingly
kicked dirt over it and kept it under
cover till your partner got back from daw-
son city with the bunch of chilcats free
men them chilcats as hadnt surrendered
their rights on fresno and they could
stake where they plagued well pleased
theyre workin- for you it aint no use
you deny in that youve grubstaked them
on this stunt a chechako could see that
am i right
  i aint goin to tell you whether youre
right or wrong or merely uncertain re-
turned tom surlily its none of your
bizness anyway them chilcats have
staked the hull vein clean to the mouth of
fresno seventeen claims in a string the
claims is air-tight thars no use in your
jawin casino you may as well shut
your mouth and go back to your jubilant
camp
  not on your blasted tin-types you
think you can file seventeen quartz claims
on end and hog the whole thing but youve
made a bad misplay tagish jim you
come here a minute
  you go to blim-blammed blazes re-
torted tagish who was now a hundred and
fifty yards down the location line you
not my boss me not come when you call
tagish commanded bassett albeit
there was a chuckle in the command you
come here
at once the chilcat dropped his
ax and strode back to the group on
the ledge
  tom my boss he insolently grinned at
the enraged casino me come when um
call
  casino glared and gulped-
  you workin for sark and bassett aint
you
  grubstaked you didnt they and own
half your winnings dont they
  sure
  all right that ii do for you you can
go back to your as and the horny-handed
toil you seem to love so well i ve asked
you all i wrant to know the rest of my
palaver concerns your employers only
he wheeled on sark and bassett
  you heard that hard-shelled heathens
admissions well so did ante gunboat
slim and alabama theyre my witnesses
and if we took the matter to court and got
a rulin on it just as sure as theres gold in
that ledge the court would view your action
as subterfuge in the face of your surrendered
rights and throw them seventeen claims
open to relocation but law and courts are
slow im for quick action now i aint
at all hoggish like you fellows and i d nt
ask you to throw any of then claims or a
like the court would all i ask you to io
is to sell us a half share in in m seven-
teen
  bluff sneered bassett you know
the court wouldnt do any sich thing they
couldnt we stand within the lav so
you try to play safe by buy in  a half share
in our ground but i tell you out  ud
distinctly and with clear enunciation
casino that we aint sellin git me we
-aint-sellin 
  you will sell bellowed casino wrath-
fully shaking his fist under toms nose
well make you sell
  go on and make then challenged
tom arising with sark from the boulder
go on and make us if eric and me kini
trim the five of you ill bun my pick and
shovel and quit the yukon in dishonor and
disgrace
  mebbe you can trim the five of us but
you sure cant trim the forty-seven of us
casino sent back theres forty-two men
at my camp yet
  he stepped to the edge of the bench
ground and emitted a howl for help that
caused the rest of his comrades to suspend
their celebration at the camp and scramble
up the slope to his aid
  whats wtong casino demanded hal-
pune foremost of the forty-two
  these ginks have found a quartz vein
three feet wide and almost solid gold
stolen thunder
theyre gettin the chilcats to stake and
usurpin the whole thing
  a violent roar went up from the crowd
at the announcement it surged up to en-
gulf casino and sark and bassett suddenly
found themselves ringed in by forty-seven
half-drunken men festering for trouble and
ready to do casinos wildest bidding
   will you sell shouted casino through
the general clamor of the mob
   not by a drastic sight sark roared at
him his blood leaping at the nearness of
the fray back to back tom well die
game
  you dodderin fools casino grated
we dont want to kill you but we sure
will unless you give in this minute sell
sell i say or well hammer you to pulp and
throw the mess in the creek
  come on and hammer then invited
sark therell be a few of you mashed
along with us
instantly the ugly ring closed
in but tom and eric had scarcely
landed the first two blows when the
hurtling body of tagish jim jumping off
the boulder above launched through the
ring-
  wait commanded the chilcat he
pushed back the foremost attackers his
native stoicism had fallen from him and
his words leaped out vociferously me
own um claim all um chilcats own um
claims we sell we dont want see um
bosses killed we sell but we sell whole
claims no shares me speak for um all
me foreman
  good better than ever exulted
casino clawing his way through his com-
rades toward tagish jim and pulling out
some paper from his pocket here ill
write bills of sale for the seventeen you
sign how much do you want
   dont you sell tagish dont you sell
warned both sark and bassett
   they tried to lurch forward but could not
make progress for in the moment of confusion
caused by tagish jims jump into the ring a
half-dozen antagonists had seized the arms
and legs of each fettering theii action and
smothering toms and erics struggles by
sheer weight
   dont you sell tagish dont you sell
they reiterated even in their futile esav
at freedom
   me got to sell explained tagish dep-
recatingly me dont they kill you me
know dawson toughs drunk on hootch
me sell all right
  how much tagish howled casino
impatiently
  twelve thousand a claim quoted
tagish mebbe um not enough but um
what tom guessed little while ago
  too steep whispered ante and gun-
boat to casino
   no no casino whispered back scrib-
bling feverishly it runs four hundred or
over to the ton ill swear it thirty tons
would pay for one claim ill fix that figure
for fear he has another think and goes
higher bassetts a bad guesser so-
turning to tagish-heres your bills of
sale twelve thousand a claim and
heres half your amount in the bills of sale
sark and bassett paid me and the rest
one hundred and two thousand you savvy
tagish the same cornin to you yet ill
get the bunch to write it off you go on
and sign
in spite of shouted protests from
sark and basset tagish jim signed
casino paid over to the chilcat the
forty-seven bills of sale totaling in value
one hundred and two thousand dollars
which he had gotten from the partners for
the string of fresno creek claims and called
on his comrades to sign for the amount of
the remainder jubilantly they did so
adding their signatures to seventeen bills
of sale for the quartz claims to the tune of
six thousand dollars each and the instant
the transaction was closed sarks and bas-
setts captors released them
  tagish jim stepped up to tom with an
apologetic almost cringing manner and
presented him with the forty-seven bills of
sale tom had originally paid out to casino
  here um your share um grubstake he
intimated sheepishly
   bassett shoved the bills of sale into his
pocket and glared at tagish without a
word as the latter went forward to distribute
the proper portion to the other chilcats
who were observed coming back in a body
from their staking and ambling up the slope
   six thousand bill um sale each um you
and me casino buy all um claims he told
them and they accepted with amazed grins
   but the transaction aint valid casino
stormed bassett raising his voice to high
heaven in the anger of defeat if them
adventure
chilcats had a got back five minnits
sooner thar wouldnt a bin any transac-
tion at all thard a bin a gerirul massa-
cre anil you and your bunch would a bin
qualifyin right now for engraved epitaphs
  still beware of llatterin yourself that
you win by the small margin of five minnits
you dont on course you forty-sevenll
try to perjure me down but  have here
eighteen responsible witnesses to prove that
them documents the bills of sale for seven-
teen quart claims on end on fresno creek
were obtained by threat under compulsion
through application of force and extortion
and intimidation while sark and me was
held incapable and in durance vile
  i warn you that you and forty-six others
constrained us against our will and robbed us
of a quartz ledge three feet wide twenty-
five thousand five hundred feet long run-
nin in your own words four hundred dollars
to the ton now the hull bunch of you jist
let them terms and figgers sink into your
dissipated consciousnesses youll hear
em agin for ill sure take this case to
the highest courts and prove my conten-
tion
  like blazes you will laughed casino
you cant prove anythin anyway and
even if you can well have a smelter built
and the stuff smelted down before you get
judgment courts are slow as for me
im for quick action halpune give me
your pick
  halpune handed him the pick which with
the foresight of one accustomed to trouble
he had grasped at casinos first yell for
aid and carried with him up onto the
ridge
  well just knock out some of the stuff
and make a rough assay ourselves casino
proposed swinging the pick it runs
that rich
the steel split off a big fragment
of the quartz with the first blow
casino picked it up and scratched
at the splendid seams the splendid seams
came off in his hand
  leaf gold eric whispered bassett in
the pregnant hush  had a hull pocket-
book full of the foil and i tamped her into
the seams on that ledge this afternoon
  you shakespearean super tom you
ought to be on the stage exclaimed sark
with a great laugh of revelation and
you ought to take tagish jim with you
i see now yuu primed him while going ui
the bench land
  casino looked up at erics laugh
  he looked down again at the stuff in his
hand
  leaf gold he yelled in disgust and
whirled on sark and bassett with up-
raised pick you planted the treacher-
ous worthless stuff and sold me a salt
  i aint sold you anythin snickered
tom keeping a wary eye upon the pick
everr man here knows i fought dead
aginst sell in to the last you forced the
chilcats to sell to you and theyre the
only ones as benefited by the deal youve
made em a present of six thousand dollars
apiece eric and me git back what you
skinned us outa by hikin us forth on a liv 
stampede plankin us down on two salted
claims prepared beforehand and enticin us
to buy up fresno creek
  saltins a game amateurs like you
shouldnt play at casino youre sun- to cjit
pickled in the end youve got a do- of
your own medicine and you alone kin tell
how it tastes now jist inform us if it tickles
your palate the odds aint all on your side
this fightin minnit theys aineuci of us
at present aginst forty-seven of you and my
private opinion is that we kin strew the
fresno valley with your mangled remains
you got any views on the subjeck you de-
sirin any special brand of tr-mble if you
aint put down that pick
  casino glared malevolently at the pha-
lanx of chilcats backing sark and bassett
under tagish jims direction
  each man stood slx feet each was
muscled like a grizzly and endowed with a
grizzlys strength each had a disconcert-
ing pair of black eyes which flashed sar-
donically at casino through the half gloom
betokening contempt mingled with the
high hope of a conflict
  casino saw their swarthy hands tightened
on the helves of the axes they carried and
their lithe frames all set for the spring and
wisdom triumphed over his malevolence
he dropped the pick
  im not desirin any special brand of
trouble im a man of peace he decided
and motioned his forty-six recruits on the
downward path to camp
from
op
the tip
the rocket

aulfwr of the
i vp  m glad youre as cross as
i you know how to be observed
h i mai a
 ijht-j perhaps the man did not hear
 certainly he did not heed he sat looking
 blankly to westward over the roofs of the
 city
   because explained maia brilliantly
 then you cant be any crosser than you
 are
    even this perfect feminine logic did not
 shake the man into a reply maia garth
 tried to crush him with a single look but her
 glare was wasted he did not see he did
 not see anything but the line of black pali-
 sades to the westward-black against an
 only less black sky
   maia poked daintily with a waxed-paper
 straw at a fugitive cherry that lurked elusive
 amid the ice fields at the bottom of her long
 glass then she looked-despairingly this
 time-at the man and noting his fixity of
 look let her own gaze follow his
   out over the heat-baked roofs dull and
 misty broken by rectangles of smoky
 furnace-like glare from the intersecting
 streets she gazed then over the dimmer
 void that was the north river to the inky
 wall of rock its crest picked out here and
 there with diamond points of blue-white
 electric lights that stood out so primly
 against the starless sky behind
   the spectacle did not inspire maia in-
 deed it vaguely depressed her and
 coupled with her escorts fixed abstraction
 it tended to bring on a fit of blues
 treasure jar
   to shake off the cloud she turned east-
 ward and leaned over so that she could see
 above the parapet of the roof-garden into
 whose far corner their table was edged
 here forsooth was a spectacle of life to
 drive away the most persistent blues from
 any one who dwelt upon the outer crust of
 his own soul
   below snapped and sparked joy real
 hand-made joy a form of joy that it took
 an aged and otherwise sajie dutch city
 three centuries to evolve
   the hot night air was vibrant with light
 and sound a swirl of color blended and
 tinged the sky from the hundred different
 hues cast by gargantuan electric signs-
 signs that seemed to hang unstained in mid-
 air in the dark murk of the summer eve-
 ning
   and in this white street itself and in its
 cross currents loafed and panted and swel-
 tered the pleasure chasers for few are
 adrift on broadway at nine oclock of an
 august night for anything but amusement
 -amusement that is fresh and optimistic
 amusement that has grown stale unto bore-
 dom noisy or apathetic or shop-worn
 amusement vet the lights the crowds
 the racket all merged into one rather stir-
 ring note by the time they reached the alti-
 tude of roof-garden parapet
   at any rate maia found it a vast im-
 provement on watching a glum-faced man
 eying a glum-faced line of palisades and
 thus cheered she tried to galvanise mov-
 lan kiel back to life again


adventure
   i cant just now think she mused
aloud of a jollier way to spend an hour in
summer than in the corner of a roof-garden
looking from a sellzer-iemonade glass that
is empty to a man whose expression makes
the glass seem brim full by contrast
hm murmured kiel abstractedly
perhaps so she agreed meekly
thats one way of looking at it of course
moylan are you thinking of staying cranky
much longer i only ask because the
fraynes are over there at the fourth table
and if you could set a time limit on your
sulkiness i could go across and sit with
them till then or-
  kiel came out of his abstraction with a
start some of her words or else a sudden
realizing of her displeasure and of his own
remissness seemed to revive him
  that is grantwood over there he an-
nounced with a general gesture toward the
palisade crest somewhere along there
just a little to the north i think
  wonderful she sighed in stark rap-
ture this is worth sitting up for grant-
wood oh think of it ill just step over
and tell the fraynes theyd love to
know
  kiel shifted his eyes from the west and
looked doubtfully at her he had not
dearly understood her effort at irony had
quite escaped him now he tried to rally
his flagging attention
  i-i beg your pardon he faltered con-
fusedly i-
  its about time she announced sar-
casm shifting in a breath to indignation
as she caught the note of semi-penitence
when you asked me to come here with you
this evening i was foolish enough to be a
little glad then you brought me to this
hole-in-a-corner table and since you
ordered i dont think youve spoken twenty
words
  im sorry you see-
  i dont see if you wanted to get on a
housetop and glower in dead silence at new
jersey why did you bring me along to
watch you do it there are more exciting
ways for a girl to spend the evening moy-
lan she broke off sharply for his
troubled eyes had left her face and
were once more fixed broodingly on the
palisades
  this time her exclamation brought him
permanently to himself
  im sorry he said again simply i
really am it was rotten of me will-will
you let me tell you about it  didnt want
to-yet i wanted it for a surprise thats
why  asked you to come here but if it
was going to happen it would have happen-
ed by now i think its quarter past nine
and nine was the time he said-
  if you  put it into english she inter-
posed with labored patience perhaps i can
understand part of it start at the subject
before last what about grantwood and
then passing lightly to the next cage who
is he
   grantwood said kiel is one of the
dozen or so suburbs that fringe the lop of
the palisades judge gregg lives there
and its out of friendship for your old
chief that you stare at the palisades he
lives on loyal friend
  no returned kiel its to see what
he means to do
  oh exclaimed maia certainly if
only you had a night glass and watched
long enough you might even sec him wind
the clock and put out the cat
  no he corrected i might see him
make my career or set me adrift
she looked at him keenly and at
the stolid earnestness in his face
her own lost its banter and annoy-
ance leaning forward she touched ever so
lightly the tanned fists clenched together
on the table top
  tell me she said softly
  they want him to go back to damas-
cus answered kiel you know how
popular he was with the natives and the
turkish government while we were there
he and i i was only a kid at the time-
the youngest vice-consul in the east they
said but i was old enough to appreciate
all that judge gregg was doing for uncle
sam over there and how he stood head ard
shoulders above the rest of the diplomatic
bunch
  youve told me but i thought he came
back to his law practise here because he
was sick and tired of the east why should
he go again
   once youve card the east a-calliny
chanted kiel villainously off key  you
wont eed nothin else 
 but-
  the government wants him to go back
the syrians in new york have heard about
it and they heard he was undecided so

from the tip of the rocket

they went over there tonight-a big dele-
gation of them-to wait on him to make
orations and pleas and other oriental argu-
ments to urge him to accept
  but you dont think he will do you
asked maia in real concern why moy-
lan if he does what will become of the plan
to take you into partnership youve built
so on that plan and-
  ive built on it he returned grimly a
lot more than you can realize perhaps a
lot more than you can care as one of the
hungry army of young lawyers in this over-
lawyered city im barely able to keep my
head above water another ounce of weight
would sink me and-and ive been long-
ing lately to take on a good deal more than
an extra ounce its meant everything to
me i hadnt any right to say so i havent
yet till im perfectly certain the judge
wont accept
  his tone sent a faint red to her throat and
forehead and her breath came a little faster
but as he paused she did not reply
  the judge solved it all when he offered
me the partnership the other day went
on kiel as his partner my future was
assured he made the offer conditional on
his refusing the damascus job but i gath-
ered that he didnt mean to take it its
always hard to tell just what good old
gregg will do his training in law and in
diplomacy too has made him pretty secre-
tive if he takes me into partnership im
made if he goes to syria im goin too
no	b
  the negation broke involuntarily through
maia garths paling lips and atthe word
a light crept into the mans eyes
  i hope i wont have to said he im
not going as his vice-consul as i went be-
fore theres no future in that im going
to make money i know how it can be done
over there- in a huriy too a single
stake and the winning end of that stake
is fortune a chap tried it while i was at
damascus
  and he won the fortune
  no  hesitated kiel he blundered
and he won-the other thing but i
sha n t i figured out the whole business
long ago just as a matter of curiosity and
sifety a way t d r n safcty penect
  what do you mean
  im sick of plodding along on nothing a
week and ol working ten hours a day to get
it i manage to get bread a roof and cheap
clothes that is all if this partnership
scheme falls through i mean to win enough
at a single throw to put me on easy street
-enough to give me the one thing in life i
want
   but what is this single throw what is
the venture that you say is safe for you but
that seems to have cost some one else his
life
  she spoke with growing uneasiness for
the first time he withdrew his gaze wholly
from the dark west and looked steadily at
her
  the shcm-es-nabihe made answer
half whispering the words
  if you are beginning to talk arabic
again she said vexedly just stop to re-
member that all of us havent had your
advantage of being the son of a missionary
and of spending our childhood in syria a
few of us are more at home with our own
language
  the shem-es-nabi  he explained too
eager to be rebuffed by the interruptionis
literally the sun of the prophet it was
mohammeds signet-ring
  oh
  it was the ring that mohammed took
from the dead hand of the negus of abys-
sinia who was slain in battle by the mos-
lem hordes back in the seventh century
it was supposed to be a talisman of vast
power the negus had looted it from a
parsee shrine on the jade stone of the
ring is carved a rising sun and there are
hieroglyphs under it
  what about it
  it is one of the six treasures of the
moslem faith the islamites look on it
with a veneration that couldnt make you
understand it is kept under guard at the
scrail in damascus and it is on view only
three times a year it will next be shown
four weeks from today and if judge
gregg upsets my hopes by going to the
east again im going to take it that day
  are you crazy
  not yet
 but how-
  a silver-gilt reproduction of the skem-
csnabi was made by the sultans orders
years ago and given to judge gregg as a
special mark of honor only a fair copy
but good enough to deceive a casual on-
looker-especially in the dim light of the
serail the judge gave it to me as a

adventure
memento when we left damascus  have it
at home it would be easy for a man who
was quick with his hands to substitute it
for th real treasure and to get out of the
city before the exchange could be found
out
  the exchange the theft you mean
if i didnt know you were joking-
  how would it be theft whose ring is
it mohammed stole it from the dead
negus and the negus first stole it from a
parsee temple to which it had probably
been brought as a votive offering by the
general or the sheik who stole it from its
original sun-worshiping owner one cant
well steal what is already stolen and whose
rightful ownership was buried in obscurity
nearly a thousand years ago the ring is as
much mine or yours or anybodys as it is
the turkish governments
  thats sophistry
  thats sense but we dont need to
ar ue it for im perfectly sure now that
therell be no need to go for it but if there
were-well the sultans people would pay
enough for the rings return to keep me com-
fortable forever and then a while longer
youd probably be caught
  no i know the country too well id
have framed up my line of escape and
when i got back here id treat with turkey
at long range
  its horrible and however much you
gloss it over it wouldnt be honest im glad
you dont have to do it but why do you
say therell be no need to go a few min-
utes ago you were afraid judge gregg
might-
  the delegation must have finished its
addresses and its pleas half an hour ago
and he has refused
  what makes you think so
  i know the syrian customs and i
know from krikorian their chairman that
theyve brought along the usual big box of
fireworks if the judges answer were
yes then-a hundred dollars worth of
fireworks in ten minutes and three hours
lawn-cleaning for the judges gardener to-
morrow morning that s why i watched
the palisades so closely till long after nine
oclock
  oh  see and i thought you were
sulking im sorry i-
  sulking worse than that it meant
everything to me the loss of everything
id been longing for the need to go out to
damascus on my great venture do you
wonder i couldnt see or hear anything else
till the danger grew less
  but why didnt you tell me beforehand
then we could have watched together
because  was afraid to because j was
afraid  wouldnt he able to tell you without
telling you something else-something im
going to tell you whether yu want to
hear it or not the moment im certain
theres no chance of his accepting do you
mind if i leave you for a minute it s a
certainty by this time that hes refused
but i want to call him up and clinch it
till then ive no right to say-
a little gasp from the girl broke
in on his speech her face had
whitened and her eyes all at once
had grown larger
  moylan kiel saw that she had shifted in
her chair and was staring westward he
whirled back to his neglected post of vigil
in time to see a red rocket burst high in air
above the palisades just to the north hov--
ering the black night with sj arks and j- is
of falling scarlet flame
  man and girl looked at each other in
tense silence for a full minute while a second
rocket then a third and a fourth cut hup
hairy arcs in the dull jersey sky and
strewed the lower air with their varicolored
stars
  then moylan kiel rose just a little un-
steadily to his feet and held out his hand
  do you mind he asked quietly if we
go home now theres a french liner sail-
ing at dawn and ive a bit of packing to
do
  a french liner she echoed vaguely
to havre he explained as if laying
out a tour for some one in whom he felt
no interest then across by land to
marseilles ill just catch a messagerie
boat there for tort said three days at
most from there to damascus perhaps
two if i can make the right-
  damascus moylan youre not-
  please dont he begged her very
gently shall we go now
  dumb from plenitude of speech rather
than from its dearth she followed him to the
elevator a backward glance showed her
the western skyline at one point fairly
snapping with fireworks that danced and
whizzed and sputtered and otherwise pro-
faned the solemn night of summer
mi
from the tip of the rocket

  she said no word nor did kiel as they
chugged uptown in a wheezing taxicab
through the sick heat and smells of the
streets but the door of the garth apart-
ment reached and the motor-brigand dis-
missed maia spoke her mind she spoke
it briefly and in a low tone but very much
to the point
  she told the sullenly listening kiel just
what a criminally reckless and recklessly
criminal exploit he was planning she
proved clearly that no man in his senses
would set forth on such an errand and that
no one who was not at heart dishonest could
so much ns give the scheme a second
thought
  she said he would break her heart with
worry also that she should not give him
a second thought nor would she care what
might befall so evil a man she told him
that the taking of the shem-cs-nabi would
be wicked theft that no wretched legal
sophistry could condone and that a man
who could do such a thing and make any
girl so miserably unhappy by going into
danger was not worthy her bothering over
  she did not play the virago nor did she
cry she was a brave little girl her voice
shook it is true and she spoke very fast-
in fact some of her wrords and even sen-
tences had to be guessed and moylan
guessed them with fearful correctness
  one thing however she did not leave to
his imagination nor to the chances of guess-
work at the end of her little speech and
when a bad cold began to impede her dic-
tion she said slowly and distinctly that if
kiel should persist in his wildly sinful in-
tent he need never never come to see her-
or try to communicate with her upon his
return the acquaintance would end here
and now
  to which he retorted that if he did not go
the acquaintance must end anyhow since
he had reached the point where it could no
longer be mere acquaintance and as
finances wrould never under present condi-
tions reach the stage where it could be any-
thing stronger
  with which grumbled morsel of repartee
he ljssed her before she could prevent him
and then strode tragically and rapidly away
before she could rebuke him-a double un-
iairness that was perhaps the cause of her
sleepless and somewhat lacrimosc night
at daybreak maia called up kiels rooms
she had tramed a new and absolutely irrefu-
table set of arguments against his going to
syria but she had no chance to deliver
them for after a centurys wait central
reported with blithe optimism-
   gramcy dont seem to answer
then maia called up judge gregg whom
she had never met
  the telephone toll from new york to
grantwood-on-the-palisades is ten cents
for five minutes maias total bill was
ninety cents and at that she continued the
talk an hour later in the judges nassau
street office and many times thereafter
n
la illaha illa llaff
smugly intoned an imm in pious
and questioning salutation of the
somewhat foreign-looking devotee in native
garb who lounged past him out of the scrail
at damascus just four weeks later
  and the man who the imam had at first
thought might be an outlander infidel ut-
terly disarmed suspicion by whining unc-
tuously in flawless syrian arabic-
  sdtdna mdmoud rasdul alldlil 
  with which speech moylan kiel slouched
forth from the government building with
the shem-cs-nabi safely reposing in the
breast of his abich
  he went at snails pace until he rounded
the comer then tucking up his robe he
ran at tcp speed through twisty streets and
foul alleyways until he reached the native
house where he lodged
  safe in his stone-floored room there he
drew forth the ring and laid it on a tabouret
near the one small barred window the
light was better than in the scrail treasure
room but not brilliant so far as kiel
could see by it the shcm-cs-lyabi was not
greatly different on close examination from
the imitation he had so deftly substituted
for it
  the band of gold was old and badly worn
so badly that its row of hieroglyphs was
well-nigh effaced there was a crack across
the jade stone splitting transversely the
rude caning of a rising sun
  from its general aspect kiel judged that
an antiquary might have given ten dollars
for the ring as it stood scarcely more
yet this was one of islams six treasures-
the relic supposedly endowed with magic
powers which the prophet himself had
handed down as an all-prized heirloom to
adventure
those of the faith who should come after
him for more than twelve hundred years
it had been guarded with adoring reverence
none of islams sons for a moment question-
ing its potency
  for a treasure so jealously watched over
its theft had been absurdly easy
  kiel had reached damascus but a day
or two before the thrice-a-year exhibition of
the relics at the serail there vouched
for by a local muezzin-whose total lack of
previous acquaintance with the foreigner
was easily bridged by a judicious use of
bakshish-he had entered the treasure
chamber with a line of devotees
  as he passed the guarded little shrine he
had stumbled awkwardly over the hem of
his robe had lurched forward and had
caught at the shrine to save himself from
falling then as two soldiers and a priest
had sprung at him he had recovered his
balance salaaming low and as soon as
possible he had withdrawn from the room
and from the building having neatly palmed
the ring and left in its place the substitute
presented to him by judge gregg
  now that the first and worst peril was
past his wits rose to the next step within
an hour or two the room at the serail would
be closed the ring and the other treasures
would be put back in their proper resting
places then infallibly the guardian of
the shem-es-nabi would discover the fraud
and the alarm would flash throughout all
the moslem world
  fanatic zeal would wing the search and
that search would be of a sort not lightly
eluded yes and if it were not successfully
eluded there would be consequences that
moylan kiel did not care to contemplate
there is no legal death penalty in turkish
dominions but criminals sometimes disap-
pear and when they do they arc seldom
found again even in sections
  clearly there was no time to be lost in
getting out of the ottoman empire the
shortest way to the coast from damascus is
by way of beirut next to that a journey
southward to jerusalem and jalta or a trip
over the mountains westward to tyre or
sidon or some other coast town where ships
touch
  wherefore as kiel had already fore-
casted every one of those ports would be
watched with a vigilance that would make
the all-seeing eye of mormonism seem
strabismic the customs folk with an
array of police-spy helpers would infallibly
search to the skin every departing native or
tourist
  and kiel had laid his plans according v
  having wasted a bare half minute in the
inspection of his booty he wrapped the ring
in a dirty amulet case such as desert trav-
elers wear and strapped it firmly beneath
the bend of his left knee he covered this
strap with a ragged cloth on which were
traces of dried blood it was a typical syr-
ian bandage-one that would have brought
tears of horror to the eyes of a first-year
medical student
  then arranging his small hoard of money
in a turban and putting it on his head he
wrapped his other belongings in a big bun-
dle slung it over liis shoulder and with a
serviceable old-fashioned arm pistol stuck
prominently in his belt sallied forth
  through an alley he wound his way
thence to the bazaar section with its
rat tan-woven roofs of brown through
which the easts yellow light filters coolly
down upon the shop-lined byways the
bazaars were crowded for the heat of tle
day was passing and kiel was forced lo
slacken his pace more than once as the foot-
crowds wyere jostled aside to permit the
passing of some laden camel or string of
donkeys or a rich man s horse
  the bazaars were left behind after an
interminable time and he swung out into
the clearer passage of the street that
is called straight- the oldest street with
a name on earth
  in time this merged into walled orchards
and then into open spaces where scavenger
dogs and black-winged gray crows squab-
bled over carrion
  a final turn brought kiel into a field
where a swarm of men were loafing idly
about a dozen busy natives who were en-
gaged in arranging loads upon the backs of
as many kneeling camels
  this was kiels first stopping-place and
he drifted unobserved into the throng of on-
lookers
  ohll a gorilla-faced man in a once-
wiutecaftan and a green turban was squall-
ing ohf mulai brother of ten thousand
infidels how can the leader canicl move
without a breaking back when you load her
with three hundred pounds on the left side
and with but two hundred on the right
is her baok as unbalanced as your swinish
brain o descendant of the donkey folk
from the tip of the rocket

  he bustled off to where a mangy dun
camel was kneeling and to a fat giant
near the beasts head he shouted furiously
  imshi child of gehenna be off to the
gutters where you belong where learned
you to load a caravan camel how think
you the brute will rest at night when on
neither side as he kneels the load touches
the ground shall we be dragging after us
a worn-out saddle-galled camel before the
third day halil show this fool of many
thumbs how to adjust the load
  from camel to camel the caravan owner
moved now nodding with an approving
grunt now shrieking imprecations whose
utterances seemed to threaten him with
apoplexy to his men-as to all oriental
porters-this tirade was a daily affair and
they took it with true eastern apathy
as the owner paused a moment
on his tour kiel approached him
o brother of giants said moy-
lan ceremoniously may you lie where rose
leaves shall fall upon your tomb
  may you live to scatter them there
surlily vouchsafed the owner
  not that he had the remotest wish of the
sort nor even a rudimentary desire to be
civil but the oriental etiquette which
demands that a conversation open with a
compliment also demands that the initial
compliment be capped by one more florid
and this foreign-looking stranger looked too
prosperous for the caravan owner to kick
  you start for bagdad queried kiel
  yes returned the owner more inter-
estedly have you freight my journey
is thirty-five days to the hour i have one
camel-by the grace of allah and to your
own blessed fortune-that is not laden
five hundred pounds she can bear and my
price for safe delivery of her cargo will be
but-
  i have no freight
  the owner in disgust turned back to his
work of supervision he had no time and
less inclination for answering idle queries
  but i wish to go as a passenger an-
nounced kiel loudly enough for all around
him to hear and speaking with a studied
nervousness i am in haste to reach bag-
dad can you let me ride with you and
spare me food
  no snarled the owner
  hismillahcarelessly returned moylan
and walked off
  the owner let him go a few steps then
finding he showed no sign of coming back
ran after him
  one hundred mcdjidiehe said
  robbery wailed kiel
  the miles of the journey are long o
effendi explained the native
  but the feet of my brothers camels are
swift as the wings of the day replied kiel
in true eastern bargain tone and the are
in grace like to the sacred beast that bore
the prophet-on whom be peaces-from
medina i am stricken and poor i do not
own a hundred medjidie
  eighty-nine countered the camel-man
now in his element as a trafficker
  inshallahl is my purse so red with gold
i am poor what says the blest koran
he that hearkeneth not unto the cry of the
true believer who is needy- 
  eighty retorted the other
  it is sheer theft moaned kiel right
loudly but my need is great i accept
  the camel-man had great ado to keep
from bursting into tears he had asked a
hundred medjidi for a passage worth thirty
and he had hoped by judicious bargaining
to get his customer to pay forty now
starting at a hundred he had been taken up
when he got to eighty and he cursed his
stars that he had not in the first place de-
manded from the spendthrift fool five hun-
dred
  the listening crowd too murmured
loudly in wonder at such a bargain
tongues were certain to wag in the bazaars
on the morrow anent the man whose need
for instant departure from damascus was
so great that he paid almost treble the
regulation passage money for the privi-
lege
  eighty medjidie the discomfited owner
at last found breath to acknowledge adding
as a clever afterthought
  half in advance the rest at the oasis
of-
  a commotion from the rear of the crowd
drew all eyes away from the chaffering
the hero of the place had just come into the
square of caravans he was a huge negro
clad in spotless white a kinky beard and
shaven upper lip distinguishing him frm
the other blacks scattered through the
throng
  his reception by the idlers reminded kiel
strongly of the entrance of escamillo the
toreador in carmen

adventure
  this black giant was a local hero the
demigod of loafers and camel-men alike
even the arrogant little caravan owner
deigned to smile pleasantly at him for
the newcomer was the great ben nassar
raad mail-carrier between damascus and
bagdad where the ordinary plodding
caravan took from five to six weeks to
make the tedious journey across the sy-
rian desert raad on his bisharin racing
camel covered the distance in ten brief days
-a feat that called forth the wondering
admiration of all syria
  to him sand-storm bedouin raid perils
of thirst of sickness of sunstroke were mat-
ters for easy scorn was he not the fearless
raad whom no less a personage than the
pasha himself was wont to salute in the
bazaar
  kiel grudgingly paid down his forty
medjidie advance money to the caravan
owner finding and counting out each piece
with a separate groan as he finished the
operation his glance momentarily crossed
that of raad-raad whose pet he had been
as a child in the mission house at nabous
-raad with whom he had passed an im-
portant hour the previous day-raad who
at this minute had in his money-belt three
hundred medjidie which kiel had turned
over to him twenty-four hours earlier
   the negros gaze traveled carelessly past
kiel and the redoubtable mail-carrier con-
tinued on his way to the corner of the field
where his two camels were cared for by a
black attendant
  between these two camels and those of
the caravan there was as much difference
as between a percheron and a thoroughbred
race horse gray-white in hue they were
clean of limb graceful as fawns unbelieva-
bly swift
   one was for raads use the other was to
traverse the desert journey alongside in
case of accident or emergency he rode
each on alternate trips
  both now were well rested from the last
jaunt from bagdad their spongy feet were
free from abrasions their humps were
hih andpendulous at a pinch and if not
meantime supplied with water both were
able to travel a hundred leagues across
desert sands in five days
   but at the end of such a forced ride their
humps would be little larger than a mans
two lists and they would be as savage as
sick bears and after stopping for water
they would be loggy and slow for the next
two days
  the mail-carrier starts when we do
kiel asked the caravan owner
  not he sneered the latter he is too
proud to start with common folk and he
starts after star-shine that he may make
his first twelve hours in the cool mount
your camel effendi we start ml eh
  his cry of mlehl was taken up by his
men kiel jumped to his kneeling mount
grunting and bubbling the twelve heavy-
laden draft camels scrambled to their feet
and of their own accord took their proper
alignment for the march
  it was not moylan kiels first nor hun-
dredth experience in the unlovely art of
camel riding he understood the knack of
getting into the divan-like high-pommeled
saddle and once there how to dispose of
the painful excess of leg length that such a
position always develops
  he did not even feel the almost universal
qualm that assails amateur riders when a
camel rises pitchingly to its feet and strikes
its gait-a gait not unlike the motion on a
ship deck in a choppy sea
  off moved the twelve-beast caravan in
triple alignment four deep sixty feet be-
tween ranks out of the square of the cara-
vans and outward toward the barely visible
strip of sand that lay like a yellow sword-
blade a days journey to the northeast
  kiel settled himself as nearly comfort-
able as an outlander may on liis huge saddle
he caught the rough sagging motion and
swayed his body native fashion to it he
was the only rider the natives at this
early stage of the journey chose to plod afoot
beside their ungainly charges later when
the desert sands should begin to burn the
feet and the desert suns to play unholy
tricks with the eyes they would be clamor-
ing for their turn to climb atop the more
lightly burdened of the brutes
  the owner first removing from his feet
a pair of vehemently scarlet slippers and
slinging them over his shoulder for safety
took his place at the head of the caravan
a tiny gray bell-donkcy pattered sturdil
at his side-the donkey that is the mascot
the real guide the highly important leader
of evenr svrian caravan
  camels may bolt may sulk may go
musth may exhibit in any fifty ways an
artistic temperament that would make 
prima donna seem stolid by comparison
from the tip of the rocket

indeed they usually do at such times all
human power over them sinks into obscurity
compared to the control exerted by that
one sober little gray donkey the tinkle
of its bell is more potent than the frenzied
howls of all the professional drivers in
islamlik
  kiel remembered from his vice-consular
days the case of a quasi-humorous ameri-
can who had been haled to the damascus
serai on the grave accusation of icsc-maj-
esfc for propounding to his syrian dragoman
the conundrum-
 why is the ottoman empire like a
string of camels
  the answer because it is led by a
donkey had been taken by the dragoman
as of doubtful compliment to the sultan
he had so reported it and judge gregg
had needed all the influence of the consulate
to clear the ribald one
  kiel familiar with the surrounding coun-
try knew to an inch where the caravan
would rest for the night he knew too
that the present jolting would be of short
duration since whether a caravan starts
at dawn or at dusk its first days journey
is precisely forty furlongs-no more nor less
-and it has been so from the birth of history
for what cause no living man knows any
more than it is known why the universal
speed of all camel caravans is gaged to the
second at sixteen furlongs an hour
  wherefore by kiels calculations the
nights rest would occur a hundred yards
beyond the tomb of assad five miles from
the square of the caravans and the halt
would be called in just two and one-half
hours from the time of starting it was to
prevent a premature halt that the start
had been delayed until after the late after-
noon call to prayer
  the forecast was wholly correct as fore-
casts involving eastern customs-but not
eastern temperaments-are more than
reasonably certain to be just beyond the
tomb the camels were made to kneel and
there still laden they were left for the
night while fires were lighted and food pre-
pared	r
  his labors and his vocal efforts momen-
tarily ended the caravan owner looked
about for his passenger with whom he had
decided dunng the five-mile walk to have
a most interesting and profitable conversa-
tion
  he was barely in time to see kiel walk-
ing slowly awar from the firelight radius
out into the starry darkness to southward
his bundle over his back that a man
should needlessly cany any burden was be-
yond the grasp of the owners oriental
mind and he inferred that kiel stretching
his legs after the ride had feared to leave
his bundle behind lest it be looted
  the incident gave the syrian a desirable
peg whereon to hang his carefully prepared
talk
oh ellendi he hailed moylan
  the latter moved on without
turning the pursuers short legs
were put to their best to catch up the pas-
senger two hundred yards away from camp
  what does this mean raged the cara-
van owner in a rage not wholly made to
order when at length he ranged alongside
his quarry why do you earn- your lug-
gage when you stray my men are honest
i	am their master-i imbarak the hon-
est
  well laughed kiel glancing about him
and then laying down his bundle in the
narrow camel track that links damascus
with bagdad what then o imbarak the
honest may i not do as i will with mine
own
  your own scoffed imbarak tis
the catchword of even- thief
  thief
  no man pays triple passage money un-
less he is in flight summed up imbarak
no man guards a bundle unless it be pre-
cious you are a thief you have stolen
that which is of value and puts the black
fear into your heart you are in flight
  well repeated kiel amiably what
then my little man
  the calmness of the accused rudely shook
imbaraks convictions that he was a thief
for do not thieves-syrian thieves-on
accusation ever beat their breasts and cry
aloud upon allah to witness their inno-
cence
  yet of one thing imbarak was right cer-
tain-kiel must have had some powerful
reason for leaving damascus in haste to
have made him pay so exorbitant a price
and whatever the reason might be its very
existence sufficed imbarak the honest
  when i took you as my passenger said
he i consented to a low fare since you be-
sought me in the name of allah the merci-
ful and because you vowed you were poor
adventure
you are not poor and you are a thief
therefore i will take you no step beyond
this
  no then i must walk back to damas-
cus to await the next caravan and mean-
time to lay information before the cadi
against one imbarak the honest who hath
robbed me of forty medjidie in passage-
money
   you dare not go before the cadi for i
too shall return at your side and  shall
tell why  refuse to let you bring ill fortune
to honest folk by remaining on the march
with us on suspicion you will be searched
and-
  exactly how much
   here was a man with a soul too gross for
the bliss of bargaining and with a sigh of
jovs foregone imbarak the honest replied
nine hundred medjidie
   oh offspring of the gadarenes ob-
served kiel if i possessed nine hundred
medjidie i would not be traveling with out-
casts upon lame and mange-stricken camels
owned by a pickpocket of the bazaars
   to be termed a pickpocket and to hear
his men referred to as outcasts was a mere
everv-dav pleasantry that ruffled imbarak
the honest not at all but a slur on ones
camels is as mortal an insult as is an affront
to ones religicn and at the expressions
lame and mange-stricken imbarak figura-
tively and literally soared high in air and
he came down bodily upon kiel ugly curved
belt-knife in fist
   kiel took the assault as philosophically
as a move in a chess-game it was in fact
a move he himself had prepared and he
was quite ready for it
  imbarak struck downward-a move in
syrian knife-fighting that means merely a
wound or a scratch as differentiated from
the gruesome up-thrust and its subsequent
wrench of the crooked blade
   kiel neatly blocked the blow with his
bundle-which received thereby a mortal
wound in its vitals-and with his right fist
caught the honest imbarak flush on the
left point of the chin	
   the caravan man was transformed into a
limp huddle of twitching clothes
   he ouht to be good for at least live min-
utes mused kiel as he hurried cityward
along the camel track unless ive forgotten
how to put steam into a right lead
   a hundred yards farther on he stopped
as a soft quadruple pad-pad-pad oi spongy
 feet broke on his ear two camels huge
 in the gloom rose ever larger in his path
 raad called moylan softly
   it was well played howaji laughed the
 negro as he made the led camel kneel to re-
 ceive its new burden yet it is worth my
 commission if it be found out here are the
 swathing-cloths wrap them as i taught
 you else you will be shaken to a jelly be-
 fore the ten days be past now mount and
 ride we can reach bagdad and you can
 leave it full ten days ahead of the hue and
 cry
ill
      maia garth had made it clear
-very painfully clear-that kiels
venture in quest of the shem-cs-
nabi would mark the end of his acquaint-
ance with her she had told him so many
times and from different angles that
august night when he left her at the door of
her apartment she had expressly forbid-
den him to hold any further communication
with her on his return from the east
   for which excellent reasons moylan
went to the garth apartment direct from
the ship he arrived at a barbarously early
hour and had the good fortune to find her
at home and momentarily devoid of visible
relatives it was not an average condition
and he took hope
   she received him as if he had called
 barely a day before instead of after a lapse
 of more than two months nor did a shade
 of expression show she noted how thin and
 how brown he had grown and that a queer
 hunted look was still lurking at the back of
 his eyes
well was her cryptic greeting
i have it was his as he drew forth the
 shcm-es-nabi
   so i see she answered scarcely glu-
 eing at it but youve forgotten some-
 thing
 i-i dont--t  c
   that i dont care to number thiees
 among mv friends
   it isnt theft he burst forth l tx-
        dont want to discuss it will you go
 	hhooked at her and he saw she was far
 worse than angry she was enlardy herlf
 -cool unruffled pleasantly firm -
no possible change of verdict in her cka
 eves
from the tip of the rocket

     as you like he said feeling all at once
 very sick and old i got this thing and i
 risked my life to get it then i dodged the
 knife of a camel-man to keep it then i
 made a ten-day trip that was a hospital-
 furnace nightmare fringed with two bed-
 ouin chases a touch of sunstroke and a day
 of sand blindness ive spent every dollar
 i had on earth-all for this measly relic and
 for what it meant to me and now it-it
 means nothing
    nothing at all she assented sweetly
 good-by he muttered trying to find
 the door
    it is good-by she agreed im sorry
 but it is
 he paused looked at the ring in his palm
 then again at her
 youve made your choice she reminded
 him in an access of tact
 yes he growled ive made it just
 this minute if it werent for this tiling
youd let me-
 isnt it too late to think of that
 no ill-ill send it back ill-have
 it sent to the serail at damascus if
youll-
 are you in earnest
 do i look like a merry jester
 it means all that to you
whats the use of rubbing it in you
know what it means even though ive no
right now to tell you and probably never
shall have let it go at that i can keep
on coming here sometimes if i send this ring
back
 yes 
 he looked again at the ring then looked
 only at her and tried to forget that he had
 ever dreamed and ventured
oud have saved time and money
she went on unkindly by believing me
when i said the same thing last august
   i thought i thought when you saw
what i had done and-and knew it meant
wealth-
    tedto catch you bcale but-
   i didnt use my own name it was
safer not to
back anc kw you et tlie nns
      senl  to judge gregg he must be
 there by now hell manage the diplo-
 matic part of the business
  there was another miserable pause
then maia twisted the subject
  theres an italian colony on the pali-
sades just south of grantwood she ob-
served irrelevantly
  he looked at her in tired perplexity but
made no comment on the wondrous news
she continued
  it seems they had a fiesta of some sort
out there-a saints day or something-
last august bands and-and fireworks
fireworks
  the word woke uncomfortable memories
yes rockets and tilings a lot of them
at night you know
  and at last a gleam of intelligence dawned
in moylans deadened brain
  rockets he babbled feebly not the
night when we-
  yes
  but judge gregg-
  judge gregg is still waiting impatiently
for a man he wants as a law partner
oh
  he is a dear pursued maia enthusias-
tically i like him weve become pretty
well acquainted these last two months he
and i
 he-
  he talks so interestingly about the east
for instance he told me a secret-a terribly
secret secret-the sultan told him want
to hear it
  moylan was too busy digesting facts to
reply but she took his assent for granted
  y ij the sultan told him said she
jfn that the shcm-es-nabi has been
      -	locked in the treasure vaults under
yildiz kiosk for three hundred years an
imitation of it is on view at damascus or
rather a series of imitations for they are
stolen at the rate of three a year so a big
supply is kept on hand the sultan gave
one to judge gregg every now and then a
story is carefully circulated that some one
has been killed for stealing the ring
the-the-
  you didnt steal anything you just
traveled across the world to change one
copy of a ring for another wasnt it funny
and- oh you bad poor boy dont
look like that how thin you are and how
brown and-oh its a shame dear

the morning the ormsby
mj j pounded her way to the east-
ward after nine oclock the
herm w ire i ess was busy i could hear
the crackle of the juice as it leaped through
the spark gap even in the engine-room
once when i had climbed the ladder for
a breath of fresh air i saw the nimble mr
todd dance up the bridge ladder with a dis-
patch in his hand is i r podd was evident-
ly in high spirits again
courtney was also abroad he bobbed
out of the chart-house grabbed the dis-
patch from podds hand and bobbed in
again from these signs i concluded that
theorwvywas approaching her destination
the watch passed slowly my thoughts
dwelt constantly upon the little man crouch-
ing in the life-boat and upon the conversa-
tion i had had with him what was the
game would mr dooins vague fears
prove well-founded was the ormsby other
than she seemed
                                          
   i had no trouble with the men in fact
 my evil-looking gang worked their heads off
 and if they didnt exactly look as if they
 enjoyed it they took good care that none
 of their muttering reached my ears but
 there was a good deal of clandestine whis-
 pering among them and about them an air
 of expectancy
   and when i was relieved and went on
 deck at noon i saw and felt the same ex-
 pectancy and suppressed excitement in the
 rest of the crew the deck crowd no longer
 sprawled about the forehatches they stood
 about in groups through the cabin door 
 saw doctor farley and raider in close com-
 munion upon the bridge henderson stood
 in earnest conversation with the man at the
 wheel
   i clambered to the boat skids on the star-
 board side and got into communication
 with dooin  saw that the canvas cover-
 ing on the life-boat had been slit for a tew
 inches near the stern an air-hole i leaned
 carelessly across the gunwale pretended to be
 searching the sea and whispered to the rent
gold at sea

  are you there this is mcneil
yes came the answer what news
there is something in the wind i an-
swered everybody is excited i think
we are coming up to our position
anything in sight
  no not even a smoke trail but the
wireless has been working all morning the
messages are for courtney
  have you heard anything
  no they fight shy of me they stop
talking whenever i draw near
  well keep your eyes skinned mosey
around and maybe those sports will let you
hear or see something
  i moseyed around i went up on the
bridge and interrupted the tete-a-tete be-
tween henderson and the man at the wheel
they stopped talking as soon as i hove in
sight but i knew that it was not because
hot scotch was abashed that i had discov-
ered him gossiping with a forecastle hand
he met me with a smile
  well mac hows things below he
greeted
  well enough i replied whats our
position
  i dont know he lied i knew he lied
because i had seen him and dacy taking
the sun as i came off watch
  tell that to a marine i told him if
you dont want to answer a civil question
say so-dont lie
  dont get sore mac he grinned i
got an awful poor memory for figures this
trip-i was advised to have
  i stepped into the chart-house captain
dacy was stretched upon the couch read-
ing courtney was seated at the table po-
ring over a dispatch and consulting a little
book at his right hand a code book evi-
dently
  hello chief exclaimed dacy did
you have any trouble with the watch this
morning
  no i told him you put the fear of
godmto them what is the position cap-
i western ocean he answered prompt-
yj  hirty-six hours from new york
  je smiled when he said it but there was
tionbigin eyes tilat frbade further ques-
 d morning mr courtney i re-
marked still seasick
facurtney itec a csmal grcenish-hued

  my word yes this beastly ship will
be the end of me you know ill never feel
like eating again
  oh not so bad as that i said easily
wait till we come alongside your country-
man-you can go aboard her and dine with
comfort those big battle-wagons are as
steady as a church in this fine weather
but she isnt so big explained court-
ney dismally from what i have heard
you know shell be worse than this ship
she is only-
  oh mcneil interrupted the captain
are your cargo-pumps ready we shall
need them soon i wish you would see that
they are gotten ready this afternoon set
johnson to work upon them
  the captain was no longer smiling his
voice had just the hint of a savage edge i
left
before the cabin door i encoun-
tered the mysterious mr podd h e
hugged a book to his breast and his
face was alight with some happy dreamy
excitement his shoulders twitched con-
vulsively
  how are you mr podd have you
definitely decided upon your particular
french red devil i inquired
  oh mr mcmeal he answered hap-
pily i have discovered that one must
have family traditions all of our best
people have family traditions mr mc-
meal this is hearts entwined by robert
c bambers the famous authority he
states that a gentleman must have family
traditions
  undoubtedly i agreed do you an-
ticipate any difficulty in procuring your tra-
ditions just what sort of traditions do
you desire
  i never thought of that he answered
uncertainly but i shall acquire family
traditions he continued confidently
when i receive my share i shall get what-
ever is necessarv--i shall be guided by mr
bambers
  you are fortunate to have such an au-
thority to rely upon said i not every
favorite author could do as much what
will your share come to
  not half as much as yours was the
unexpected reply
  do you think it will be enough for your
plans i asked thinking of the thousand
dollars that had been promised me
adventure
  of course he replied it will be a
fortune there are twelve-
  podd you might be needed in the wire-
less-room came a level-voiced interrup-
tion
   turned doctor farley stood in the
cabin doorway regarding podd with a men-
acing glare he said nothing more but the
luckless podd collapsed like a punctured
balloon a look of deadly fear came into
his staring eyes and he turned and dashed
for his station at top speed
  your dinner is ready mr mcneil
said farley
  i gulped over my astonishment and dis-
appointment
all right i answered ill be there in
a moment i have to go below just now
in the engine-room i found mr johnson
alias werner already at work upon the car-
go-pumps
  they are to be in working condition this
afternoon i stated
  lija i yoost overhaul dem he answered
by the way mr johnson i asked
have you figured out what your share will
come to a neat sum hey
  he drew himself up stiffly and his face
flushed
  i nod work for dere dirty gold he said
i strike for der-
  he checked himself and regarded me re-
sentfully
  vait you see and he turned to his
work
  i tried to prod him into another out-
burst but without success der pumps
vill be ready was all i could obtain from
him
  i returned to the deck and made my way
to doom
  well ive moseyed around i whis-
pered to the hole in the canvas
  good sport came his voice what
did you discover
  the first mate is a clam-no news from
him captain dacy ditto i tried to pump
courtney but dacy interfered just as i was
about to learn something i know one thing
-the british ship we are bound for is a
small ship and we will raise her some time
today or tonight
  but they are very secretive i couldnt
even discover the position of the ship
dont you know where we are asked
dooin
  no idea of the latitude and longitude
but allowing for change of course i figure
we are about three hundred miles east by
north of new york
  umph grunted dooin kind of
vague if need arose and we were able to
send a wireless anything else
  i told him about podd the wireless man
i think he is crazy but not too crazy
 said hes spending a fortune in his
mind with the aid of a popular author
the fortune is to be his share from this trip
-and he stated that i also shared in the
cut pretty soft for me but i would like
to know more about it podd was scared
silly when farley interrupted us-evident-
ly had no business talking to me what do
you make of it just a fair- tale
  i dont know muttered dooin any-
thing else
  yes i asked myr german friend about
his share he got insulted and told me he
did not work for their dirty gold said he
was striking for something or other
  phew exclaimed dooin say this
ship isnt armed is she
  no i thought of that-privateering or
something like that but the old tub is sj
slow she couldnt catch a brick-scow
well remarked dooin well just have
to await developments something is rot-
ten
  we talked a little while longer and he
asked me particularly about podd he was
interested in his mercurial spirits and nerv-
ous habits
  he may be our man he commented
finally
  how do you mean
  well every chain has its weak link
look for the weak link with which an-
swer i had to content myself
  i am going to snatch a bite to eat and
then turn in i told him at last i need
sleep ill try to have a word with you be-
fore  go on watch again
hany engineer is sensitive to engine
sounds at sea the rhythm of the
screw is ever present in his con-
sciousness and waking or sleeping he is in-
stantly aware of any change in the move-
ment
  hence i awoke when the ormsby slowed
clown i lay idly for a moment listening to
the crackle of the wireless then through the
open port came the sound of captain dacy 
voice shouting orders
gold at sea

  i rolled out with the captain giving or-
  ders there must be something afoot i had
  turned in standing so i was on deck imme-
  diately
 one glance ahead showed me what the
 hullabaloo was about we had arrived a
 half-mile ahead on the starboard bow a
 long gray three-funnel torpedo-boat de-
 stroyer lay motionless on the smooth sea
 captain dacy was in active command
 upon the bridge courtney his sickness for-
 gotten danced excitedly in and out of the
 chart house henderson and raider drove
 their watches about the decks with unac-
 customed vigor everything was being done
 with snap and ginger the strong hand
 had taken hold
  i lost no time in clambering up beside the
  life-boat
 we have arrived i whispered as i
 leaned across the gunwale and examined
 the craft we were approaching
  what is it came dooins answer
  a torpedo-boat destroyer i said a
  big one no flag but of course she is the
  britisher shes a big oil-burner
  any news he asked
  no we are getting ready to go along-
  side her lines are out and a gang is open-
  ing the hatch to number one hold where
  the stores are captain dacy is on the
  job
 captain dacy proved he was on the job
 by hailing me that very moment
  oh mcneil come here will you
 i made my way to the bridge and dacy
 drew me aside in the wing and spoke confi-
 dentially
 mcneil will you go below and take
 charge hat dutchman has just informed
 me through the speaking-tube that the car-
 ape-ed-we shai need them
 saihr  right tllis orningi
  otlrh ftestd them myself johnson was
  overhaul mg them this afternoon
ic tesrtt- -
 and indifferent	throttle unworned
  yvhat s the matter with the pumps i
  asked
  phvihaf nt timc  finish der job
he re-
 f walked over
 pumps and almost
examined
 collapsed
the two
disabledi
 they were all but wrecked there was not
 a ring of packing or a valve in place in either
 pump the bonnets were off and the nuts
 scattered the rods were lying upon the floor-
 plates the busy mr johnson in a few
 hours of bungling had caused damage that
 would take most of the night to repair
   i was furious and cursed him roundly
 he smiled philosophically and answered
 nothing i was so angry that i failed to re-
 mark upon the strangeness of any engineer
 doing such a thing then my tongue hav-
 ing eased my mind a bit i started to work
   we were soon tied up to the man-o-war
 johnson was receiving bells from the bridge
 even before i started to work as soon as
 the rattle of the deck winches apprised us
 below that the stores were being transferred
 johnson quietly disappeared without even
 offering to help me i was quite content to
 have turn go
   i pressed the watch into service and af-
 ter a fifteen-minute trial during which they
 deliberately undid all i accomplished i
 drove them away then i sweated and
 swore and labored alone
   captain dacy came down and with him
 was a youngish man in the undress uniform
 of an officer of the british navy
   this is captain montague of the
 wasp said dacy to me captain mon-
 tague this is my chief engineer
   captain montague inclined his head in
 my direction a frigid half-inch in return i
 gave him a nod that was as curt and con-
 tinued with my work
   we have been working upon the pumps
 ever since we left new york glibly ex-
 plained dacy we had hoped to have
 them ready by the time we came up with
 you but there was too much to be done
 upon them but mcneil assures me that
 they will be in operation before morning
   i should hope so my word they must
 be exclaimed the englishman we
 havent enough oil in our tanks to last us
 two hours steaming and we must be away
 by morning
   ill have them running by midnight i
 told him two hours pumping will fill
 you up
   captain montague was much relieved
 and his face cleared
    hat will do very well said he i do
not care so long as i get my fuel by day-
light it is safe enough to lay by you this
fair weather and i will admit that all of us
-
adventure
will relish a few consecutive hours sleep
my ship is a poor place for rest when under
way if you like mr engineer i will send
over a couple of my artificers to lend you
a hand
  no thank you i answered hastily i
can make out very well alone
  i had no desire to have a couple of super-
cilious navy men working at my elbow the
englishman did not press his offer for
which i was grateful
  he and dacy stood there talking for
some time dacy lying volubly and pro-
testing that we had been laboring night and
day upon recalcitrant pumps since leaving
port dacys readiness to lie to save his
face surprised me  had not thought him
that kind of man but it was none of my
business and i kept my mouth shut fi-
nally they departed and left me alone
  i kept my promise to have the pumps in
running condition by midnight then as-
certaining through the speaking-tube from
the bridge that everything at the other end
was in readiness i started the oil into the
war-ships tanks i set an oiler to watch the
pumps and dirty tired and hungry climbed
to the deck
  i had intended to communicate with doo-
in but found no opportunity for doing so
immediately henderson met me at the
engine-room door and escorted me forward
grown garrulous of a sudden and regaling
me with an off-color story
  the destroyer was lying by our star-
board side dark and quiet our own decks
were black the stores evidently all trans-
ferred i looked over the rail at the war-
ship but beyond a few dim forms visible
on her bridge her decks seemed deserted
henderson stuck at my side and seeing no
chance to reach dooin just then i entered
the cabin
  dacy farley and podd were in the cabin
dacy greeted me effusively complimented
me upon a task well done and offered me
the use of his own bath in which to clean
up farley smiled upon me ingratiatingly
and informed me that he had saved a hot
dinner for me podd grinned vacantly and
conveyed the impression that the sight of
me gave him unalloyed delight henderson
continued his reminiscences it seemed as
if all were now cultivating me even as they
had before avoided me
  i was too dirty and hungry to take much
interest iu anything save a bath and sup-
per for the time being i enjoyed the cu-
tains tub and then sat down to the appe-
tizing mess the big negro turk brought me
from the galley
       while i ate i became acutely con-
scious of the peculiar bearing of my
companions farley paced nervously
up and down the cabin henderson was
absurdly loquacious podd said nothing but
sat tensely on the edge of a chair his bulging
eyes glistening with excitement only ijucy
was calm he sat with immobile face a cigar-
stump clamped between his jaws
  from their demeanor i gained the im-
pression that something was about to hap-
pen what i did not know could not
guess who could have guessed the truth
but my liveliest curiosity was aroused and
in a measure i was placed upon my guard
  captain montague was well pleased
when the pumps started remarked dacy
he has turned in with the rest of bis crew
poor chaps they have a hard time at sea in
that class of ship
   i noticed her dc-cks darkened as i came
forward i responded isnt captain
montague taking quite a chance-leaving
his vessel practically unguarded at sea and
in wartime
  no danger answered dacy he has
posted an anchor watch and all lights are
doused both upon the	and upon us
his men could turn out at a moment s no-
tice
  she is a mighty long way from a safe
base i commented a destroyer doesnt
usually operate alone so far from a home
port
  the wasp is one of a new type said
dacy she has a steaming radius of two
thousand eight hundred miles with oil fuel
and a speed of thirty-six knots when driven
she is from halifax and has been cruising
off new york for a couple of weeks she is
better for commerce destroying than a
larger vessel
   where is courtney i asked
   mr podd jumped nervously at the ques-
tion and glanced at farley
   gone to bed said farley
   where i am going directly i answered
i am tired	
   have a nip of schnapps before you go
said dacy  farley there is a bottle upon
the sideboard	
   farley stepped to the sideboard behind
gold at sea

me i noticed todd watching him mouth
agape aroused  directed my eyes to the
mirror hanging on the wall in front of me
  in die mirror i saw farley pick up the
bottle and pour out the drink then he
cast a quick look at my back drew a tiny
bottle from his breast-pocket and passed
his hands across the top of the glass intend-
ed for me it was all done in a flash
  here you are chief said farley
prime kentucky stuff-do you good
  he handed the doctored glass to me i
took it stood up and looked him square in
the eye such was the mans effrontery he
never blinked an eye though he must have
known from my look that i knew what he
had done
  his aplomb touched the tinder to my
choler i dashed the drink into his face
and took him by the throat i thrust my
hand into his breast-pocket and whipped
out the phial it was unlabeled and the
contents a colorless liquid
  you little crook i cried shaking him
what do you mean by drugging my
drink
  he struggled futilely and i tightened my
clutch on his windpipe then he was tom
from my grasp and i found myself strug-
gling desperately with dacy and hender-
son who had flung themselves upon me
  i downed henderson with a blow on the
jaw and wrestled furiously in the iron
grasp of captain dacy he was a stronger
man even than i
  i heard rushing feet on the deck without
in answer to his low sharp cry men
swarmed into the cabin i was seized from
behind and my arms pinioned
  it had happened so quickly-my anger
and its consequences-that i was dazed i
made an effort to continue the struggle and
found myself powerless to move my arms
were twisted behind me and strong expert
hands clutched my wrists
don t disable him i heard dacy say
  i subsided and twisted my head around
ihe cabin was filled a half-dozen men had
answered daevs cry henderson was just
picking himself up from the floor nursing
his jaw with both hands
  i stared at the men and my jaw dropped
i hey were my own crowd men of the black
gang my assistant johnson led them
anl in his hand he bore a naked sword
about each mans middle was strapped a
cart  idge belt and a brace of revolvers
  i stared and there came to me a light-
ning comprehension of the stunning truth
i opened my mouth to shout a warning to
scream at the top of my voice a message
that dooin in the life-boat and mayhap the
ship beside us would hear
  one of the men behind me crooked his
arm around my throat and choked my
speech
  gag him i heard dacy exclaim
  my head wtas roughly drawn back into
my mouth was forced the gag-a piece of
cork wrapped with a napkin i soon discov-
ered the ends of the thing were drawn
tightly across my cheeks and knotted to-
gether at the back of my neck i was help-
less i could not utter a sound for a few
moments i could hardly breathe
  a low-voiced conversation was going on
behind me in which i made out dacys
voice but could overhear nothing then i
was roughly urged ahead by the men be-
hind me
  we traversed the cabin the cabin alley-
way and emerged on deck i was choking
and there was a buzzing in my head i was
only half-conscious that numerous figures
surrounded me i was shoved and dragged
across the deck to the side of the ship
  have you got them i heard a voice
cry softly
  yes here they are came the answer in
farleys voice
  my arms were jerked from behind me
and forced around a stanchion in front of
me i felt the touch of cold steel upon my
wrists and heard a click my captors un-
handed me and stepped away
  instinctively i jerked my arms apart
they came some three inches i was hand-
cuffed to the stanchion
  pleasant thoughts mr mcneil came
farleys level venomous voice in my ear
  then i heard retreating footsteps
ix
i was helpless the stanchion i
was shackled to was one of the
bridge supports-an iron i fully
ten inches wide by twisting my head i
could see for some distance along the
ormsbys deck both fore and aft and by
twisting my body and stretching my neck
i could also peer around the edge of the
stanchion and down upon the destroyers
decks
adventure
 the gag lurt me cruelly i tried but un-
 successfully to reach my head around the
 stanchion so that my jaws and lingers would
 meet i bit and chewed frantically upon
 the cork in my mouth and only succeeded
 in giving myself pain  was panic-stricken
 at the thought of the deed about to happen
 and of my utter inability to warn the sleep-
 ing ship that lay before me
 then  became still and waited with hor-
 ror and despair for the thing to happen
   stealthy footsteps passed and repassed
 behind me it was a dark night bright
 with stars but moonless not a light was
 showing upon either ship the ormsbys
 bulk towering above the wasp threw the
 latters decks into black shadow but by
 twisting my head i could make out many
 dim moving shapes upon our own decks
 dacys whole hell-crew was stirring
   from the bridge of the wasp came the
 sound of the bell four bells-two oclock
 from the destroyers forecastle came the
 gruff subdued hail four bells and all-s
 well and from the bridge the boyish
 treble of the midshipmans response alls
 well
   i heard dacys voice behind me
   we must strike now mcneil said two
 hours pumping would fill her up  he time
is up 	
   we are ready forrd came henderson s
 voice
    all ready aft from raider
   werner called dacy softly the ger-
 man emerged from the gloom take your
 gang and get to work upon the engines
 directed dacy
   the group moved away forward di-
 rectly a group of men crept aft as they
 passed me i saw that they bore coils of
 rope and jacobs ladders they strung
 along the rail-dim blots in the night
   i heard dacys guarded voice again
 remember light up at the sound of the
 whistle
   avc aye sir was the murmured re-
 sponse		
   three men climbed the ormsby s rail and
 descended to the destroyers decks they
 made no effort at concealment and clumped
 over the wasps steel decks
   whos there came the midshipmans
 hail	 tt
   camc to look at your tanks came hen-
   dersons voice they must be about
   full
 all right was the answer ill go
 with you
 the wasps officer-lie was but a mid-
 shipman and a boy i afterward knew-
 joined henderson and the other two i hey
 strode to the engine-room hatch and disap-
 peared below
   what happened next has been the sub-
 ject of much foolish comment in the public
 press but then a war-ship pirated and her
 crew subdued by half their number of cut-
 throats small wonder that being ignorant
 of details the press should wax sarcastic
 and the public skeptical it seems to be-
 long to another century-to sir henry mor-
 gan and the spanish main
   but indeed roger dacy was himself a
 very morgan of a man and the crew who
 followed him aboard the wasp was fully as
 evil and desperate a gang as ever boarded
 a galleon in the olden days
   because the governments concerned have
 maintained silence a grave injustice has
 been done captain montague and his men
 the truth is they never had a chance
   as soon as the engine-room hatch closed
 over the heads of henderson the middy and
 the other two men dacy and his crew com-
 menced
   fore and aft along the ormsby s rail the
 ropes and the ladders were softly lowered
 over the side men swarmed down them to
 the wasjys deck it was done so silently
 and swiftlv that i watching and expecting
 could but dimly perceive the maneuver m
 the darkness the men of the u asps an-
 chor-watch off their guard and unsuspect-
 ing of treachc-rv were not aroused in a
 moment the wasps decks were filled with
 swiftlv moving shapes
    oos there came from the destroyer s
 bridge ey my god- ah-h-h i he
 voice trailed away in a choking gurgle
   a chorus of veils answered by spitting
 flames and the crash of revolver shots a
 scream and then a shrill whistle sounded
   instantly the wasps decks were bathed
 in bright light along their entire length
 the onnsbvs searchlight was trained upon
 the wasps after quarter the wasp s own
 two searchlights lighted the amidship sec-
 tion and the forecastle
 what happened happened so quietly
 that i could hardly grasp it when the
 lights went on the destroyer s decks were
 crowded with ihe ormsbys men a group
 were engaged in clamping shut the door to
gold at sea
the crews quarters forward and some of
them were shooting through the port-holes
at the helpless men inside other groups
were disappearing down the fire-room and
engine-room hatches a third gang among
whom was dacy tumbled down the after
hatch that opened to the officers quarters
  pandemonium from the forecastle came
the yells of the imprisoned men answered
by revolver shots from the engine-room
came cries and shots and the long-drawn
shriek of a man going out in agony from
the after hatch down which dacy had gone
came more shots and shouts
  out of that after hatch came a pajama-
clad figure-the unfortunate captain mon-
tague he carried a dispatch-box in his
arms and ran toward the side of the ship
he was wounded and staggered as he ran
  a streak of flame burst from the yawning
hatch montague dropped the box threw
up his hands and fell forward upon his face
out of the hatch leaped farley smoking re-
volver in hand he ran to montagues side
and pounced upon the dispatch-box
  the uproar ceased as abruptly as it com-
menced save that the men in the forecastle
still howled and the gang without still shot
into the port-holes that opened aft
  out of the cabin hatch came two pajama-
clad figures guarded by revolver-armed
men then came dacy and following him
four men who carried two limp bodies the
four staggered to the side with their ghast-
ly burdens and threw them into the sea
  a gang commenced to collect the bodies
scattered about the deck-the bodies of
montague and of the anchor-watch i
gazed horror-struck i counted twelve
splashes as the sea received the murdered
dead out of the engine-room came more
men prisoners and guards and men carry-
ing limp burdens which they gave to the
sea i counted twelve splashes and was
sure there were more
  dacy gave some orders the ormsbys
searchlight was switched from the wasps
after deck to the ormsbys foredeck a
gang of men under raiders command re-
boarded the ormsby they went to the
lorehatch and removed a section of the cov-
ering then with drawn weapons they
stretched along the rail
  then commenced the transference of the
prisoners the pa jama-clad officers and
the men taken in the engine and fire-rooms
were made to climb the ladder to the orms-
bys deck they were forced to descend into
the forehold when they had disappeared
the hatch section was replaced and raider s
crowd stood guard
  on board the wasp a parley took place
between dacy and the men imprisoned
within the forecastle compartment the
forecastle door opened a scant ways it
swung outward and three of the wasps
men squeezed through the door was slam-
med and fastened behind them
  the three were compelled to board the
ormsby and descend into the forehold after
the same manner as their shipmates safe-
ly in the hold and the hatch replaced over
their heads the word was passed to the
crowd upon the wasp the forecastle door
was opened again three more men emerged
and the whole process was repeated
  in this manner the wasps crew was
transferred fifty-one men came out of
that forecastle in groups of three they
had no chance to resist they were sur-
rounded by armed men from the instant
they reached the wasps deck until the
were safely belowr in the ormsbys forehold
ppm such was the taking of the ttsp
         poor montague has been charged
with carelessness and his men with
cowardice neither charge is true the
men were given no chance to organize re-
sistance they were completely surprised
and how could montague have suspected
danger from the rusty old supply ship
brought to his side by a representative of
his own government
  the wasp had been three weeks at sea
to one who knows nothing of torpedo-boats
or destroyers this may not appear signifi-
cant it really means that for twenty-one
days the men on the ir<z5/> had been sub-
sisting upon pick-up lunches and contenting
themselves with cat-naps of rest those
over-engined shells are nerve-racking tiring
places to live in at sea
  the wasps complement had been de-
pleted through the dispatch of prize crews
when she sighted the ormsby that after-
noon she had but seventy-three officers and
men aboard they had been standing
watch and watch for weeks and all hands
were tired out in merely posting an an-
chor-watch and allowing the rest of his
crew to obtain a nights sleep montague
did what any officer with his mens well-
being and comfort at heart would have done
adventure
  nor would it have made much difference
 had a full watch been on duty dacys
 crowd would have still outnumbered them
 and the surprise would have been just as
 complete it might have cost dacy a few
 more lives but he cared nothing for that
 as it was he lost just one man-slain by
 montague as the latter leaped from his bed
 during the invasion of the cabin
  the wasps build laid her open to just
 such an attack there are no deck-houses
 or other obstructions on a destroyers decks
 abaft the bridge on the wasp only the
 three funnels and the square hatches broke
 the llush decks
   the forecastle was high and broke at the
 beam beneath the forecastle head the en-
 tire crew berthed there was but the one
 door the rest of the ship was compart-
 ments a destroyer is just a box of com-
 partments there was no communication
 between them save through the little square
 hatches in the deck there were no doors
 below decks-just sheer steel bulkheads iso-
 lating each section
  dacy knew destroyers he knew how
the wasp was constructed he knew that
with the steel door to the forecastle closed
the major portion of the crew would be im-
prisoned he knew he had then only to
reckon with the few men in the isolated fire-
rooms the men in the engine-room and the
few officers in the cabin the capture of
the wasp was planned beforehand down to
the least detail and the plot was daringly
and ruthlessly executed
fzsa throughout it all i stood at
fig the ormsbys rail handcuffed to the
stanchion a horrified and fascinated
witness to the scene the audacity of the
act was stunning the butchery that accom-
panied it nauseating
   i am not a squeamish person i have seen
 many men go out with boots on and with
 boots off i myself have sent a couple
 across the line-but in fair fight and for
 good cause the heartless cold-blooded
 thoroughness with which dacy knifed and
 pistoled his way to victory sickened and en-
 raged me i struggled with my bonds and
 bit impotently upon my gag
  my eyes were riveted upon the wasp
but my thoughts would fly to the lile-boat
upon the skids above my head dooin
where was dooin why did he not do
something and then a glimmer of cold
reason would touch me dooin what
could he do doubtless the little secret
agent was crouching overhead as unwilling
a spectator as i to the scene and as power-
less to intervene
   the wasps men were all safely herded
into the forehold of the ormsby and cap-
tain dacy s voice sounded from lhe destroy-
ers deck in crisp orders the gang tlew to
obey a number of them rushed below lo
the uss engine-room and lire-rooms and
soon  heard the hum and the roar as the
oil fires were increased beneath the boilers
   get that englishman in the chart-house
and chuck him into the hold came from
the wasps deck
   some of raiders men left the foredeck
and came aft climbed to the chart-house 
and reappeared jugging an unconscious j
body they carried him forward and as i
they moved into the glare of the searchlight j
i saw that they carried courtneys inani-
mate form poor courtney he had par- 
taken of farleys mixture no doubt
   they carried him to the forehatch nd
lowered him into the hold then the hatch 
section was replaced for the last time a 
heavy tarpaulin was drawn over the hatch j
and the battens were placed and hammered j
down
  werner came dacys hail from the j
  immediately came the germans reply j
from the ormsbys engine-room door
   j here i vas ready
   then come aboard here and prepare to j
get under way
   a i leave vun man to smash der dy- j
name
   johnson or rather werner slid down to
the wasps deck he spoke with dacy for j
a moment and then disappeared into the 
wasps engine-room
   get the boxes with the uniforms or- 
dered dacy
   from the ormsbvs forecastle were handed 
two big packing-boxes they were hoisted
to the rail and lowered to the h asp s deck fl
where they were seized and whisked away -
into the latters forecastle
  bring mcneil aboard	
  men approached me farley s voice i
spoke in my ear	  j
   well mcneil i hope you enjoyed the 
entertainment
   the handcuffs that bound me to the stan-
chion were unlocked and removed and my
gold at sea

numbed arms fell to my sides with a gun
tickling my ribs i was forced to clamber
the rail and slide rather than climb down
a jacobs ladder to the wasps deck i was
urged across the deck to the cabin hatch
  presently i found myself between decks
in the lighted passageway of the officers
quarters it was a fore-and-aft passage
with doors opening on either side i caught
just a glimpse of a vista of disordered rooms
and of a great ugly black splotch on the
carpet underfoot one of my guards flung
open a door i was thrown into one of the
rooms and the door was slammed and locked
behind me
x
i unknotted the napkins and
removed the gag from my mouth
i spat the cork out thankfully and
looked about for water my throat was
raw and my tongue swollen
  there was a desk before me with a water-
bottle upon it it was empty i searched
and in the bottom drawer of the desk i dis-
covered a siphon of soda and a bottle of
whisky
  i guzzled the soda and it brought relief
to my tortured mouth i also took a stiff
jolt of the liquor
  i was in an officers berth the bunk
was in wild disorder and trailing blankets
and overturned chairs gave evidence of a
recent struggle but there were no blood-
stains about and i decided that the room
had belonged to one of the pajama-ciad
men now imprisoned on board the ormsby
i set aright one of the chairs fell into it
and tried to think
  before my eyes flashed the scene  had
just witnessed-the attack the surprise
the slaughter and the stream of prisoners
descending into the forehold piracy
bloody piracy what did it mean the
great war furnished a pregnant and obtru-
sive background to the picture was it pi-
racy there was werner was it all part
of a carefully planned german plot
  i looked at my watch - four - thirty
three hours and a half had elapsed since
 arley attempted to drug me in the orms-
oy j cabin it seemed an age
  i could not think clearly i heard the
clumping of heavy feet upon the steel plates
over my head and i reflected dully that
daylight must be breaking but i had not
energy enough to turn my head to the port-
hole physical weariness mental reaction
and the soporific effect of the whisky i had
drank all weighed upon me i stumbled to
my feet threw myself upon the crumpled
bunk and was asleep instantly
  i slept hours though it seemed but a mo-
ment until i opened my eyes refreshed
the wasp was under way the vibration
omnipresent upon such craft brought a
rhythmic tremor from even- plate and beam
and rivet the glow of sunlight diffused
through the room whenever the port-hole
lifted above the racing waters
  i rolled out and tried the door locked
i was still a prisoner i looked at my watch
nine-thirty i had slept a full five hours
  i sat dowrn in the chair and again re-
viewed the events of the past night but
though i brought a freshened brain to the
task and though my plight was pressing i
could find no answer to the riddle a
twentieth-century piracy nonsensical
a german plot there was but one ger-
man in the crowd and he a subordi-
nate
  but i realized now what my value was
to dacy and his crowd i understood now
his queries as to my mechanical ability and
his pleasure in discovering that i was fa-
miliar with torpedo-boat engines
  i was in the hands of a desperate gang
who held human life cheaply-the night
had given gruesome proof of that there
was no bright spot in the gloom of the situa-
tion i did not doubt that they would snuff
me out in an instant if i opposed them i
must go easy i must pretend to fall in with
their wishes i must not lose my temper
my life depended upon it
  if dooin were only at my side i had
faith that the little detective would and
means to rip the bloody net that i was
meshed in
  but where was dooin on board the
ormsby if alive-perhaps his bod too
swirled in the depths the ormsby where
was the ormsby now
  my gloomy meditations were abruptly
terminated by the rat tling of the door-knob
the lock clicked and the door opened
  a sailor wearing the blouse of a british
navy bluejacket and with a cutlass and
revolver belted about his waist confronted
me he spoke and  recognized him-it
was worden he stared at me with a ma-
levolent eye but saluted with perfect grav-
ity and spoke meekly

adventure
   captain dacy would like to see you sir
 i am to take you to him
   followed him into the passageway as
 i traveled the length of the passage i saw
 that it bisected the officers quarters the
 berths were to starboard the wardroom and
 pantry to port the ladder to the deck
 was at the forward end of the passage
   worden led me up the ladder to the deck
 i paused for a moment and swept the sea
 with a wide-circling gaze not a sail or a
 smoke-smudge in sight or any sign of the
 ormsby the wasp was alone on the sea
 dashing northward i judged by the sun
 and at a good twenty-five knots the sea
 was calm yet the lift was such that i could
 hardly keep my balance and the plates
 under my feet trembled like aspens from
 the vibration of the engines
  we went forward and mounted to the lit-
 tle bridge the wasp sported worden mo-
 tioned for me to enter the tiny chart-
 room
       dacy was seated at a table an
 open dispatch-box at his elbow por-
 ing over a queer-looking book-a
 book with sheets of lead for covers this
 was the prize that the wounded captain
 montague had endeavored to give to the
 sea just before farley killed him
 in the corner of the room was a second
 table and upon it the wireless apparatus
 podd was seated there also bent over a
 book-his beloved bambers i had no
 doubt he lifted a lugubrious countenance
 as i appeared got to his feet and departed
 giving me a blank stare as he passed
    dacy looked up gone were the pleasant
  smile and amiable manners this was an-
  other dacyf the true dacy his face was
  stern his cold inscrutable eyes drilled into
  me he was the forceful leader i had sensed
  him to be from the first
    well mcneil he said i suppose you
  wish to know what all this means
    yes i answered what does it
mean	
    it means that you arc embarked in the
  greatest adventure of the century there
  is money in it-big money
     it is bloody piracy i exclaimed
    if you will be reasonable mcneil you
  will be rolling in wealth within a week if
  you are not reasonable-but we will not
  speak of that i am sure you will be rea-
  sonable nineteen men went over the side
 last night i would not like to add to the
 number
 the threat was not lost upon me so
 nineteen men had died the night before
 what do you want of me i demanded
 i want you to be my chief engineer-a
 job of a different caliber from the one you
 had upon the ormsby
   i want nothing to do with it i cried
 i do not care to hang
   you have no choice he said gravely
 if we hang you hang when they learn
 of this affair ashore you will be mentioned
 as one of the leaders
   what i exclaimed i one of your
 gang why i wras shanghaied
   i will be frank with you mcneil you
 are implicated as deeply as any of us your
 name was forged upon the ormsbys arti-
 cles and-do you recall that when you
 came to yourself upon the ormsby you re-
 marked upon the odor of alcohol on your
 bunk and upon your clothes
   yes i said startled why
   we poured whisky upon you for a pur-
 pose before we left new york we were in-
 spected by lieutenant haun of the revenue
 cutter beaver - ah you know him and
 you were shown to him stretched out in the
 bunk apparently sleeping off a drunk he
 mentioned vour evil character to me
   the devils they had deliberately placed
 me in a false light before a man who hated
 me-an influential man who would cheer-
 fully take oath as to my desperate charac-
 ter lieutenant haun of the beaver was
 the man i had tricked when the coboy was
 wrecked as haffner well knew haun
 would enjoy the task of defaming me
   i used some very hard language
   easy the captain admonished words
 will not alter facts-you must face it 
 yes i agreed sullenly i guess you
 have me cornered what have you done
with the ormsby
   she is behind us somewhere he an-
 swered we turned her adrift with this
 ships crew battened down in the forehold
   how long do you think they will stay
 there i asked there are determined
 men and good mechanics in that crowd
 they can do nothing he replied v e
 smashed the dynamo and dismantled the
 wireless and put the engines out o com-
 mission they can do nothing dnft
 about until picked up-and that will not be
 until too late to interfere with us
gold at sea
i
  but a warm ray of hope shot through me
at his words with the ormsby above
water dooin was alive with an agent of
the department of justice to attest my
story i need not much fear any net of cir-
cumstantial evidence that might be drawn
about me with dooin behind me there
was small danger of my being branded as
one of these gallows-birds but i showed
none of my elation to dacy
  well i said what is your game and
what do i get out of it
  now that is sensible of you to take it
in that spirit he replied you are to
take charge of the wasps engine-room and
your share of the expedition will amount to
about two hundred thousand dollars
huh fine promises i retorted you
must be flying high for a newly born pirate
this is no scoffing matter he frowned
you realize that it has been serious enough
so far we are taking a big chance for a
big prize we are after gold amounting to
twelve millions of dollars we are going
to get it
  i slowly digested this astounding state-
ment
  where is it i demanded somehow i
knew he was speaking the truth
  you will know that in due time was
his response
  but good goa man i cried this is
madness these are not captain kidds
days-this is the twentieth century you
cant pull off a piracy nowadays and get
away with it theyll scour the world for
you
  we have already accomplished the most
difficult part of the enterprise he said eas-
ily the gold is waiting for us and our
getaway is already arranged for
     ou seem to be verv sure of vo
i suggested
we are already in communication with
er by wireless she is waiting for us to
convoy her-the fly waiting for the spider
e chuckled as if the joke were good do
vou see this mcneil he patted the book
with the lead covers this is the secret
code book of the british nav-a rare jewel
r some people we could mention hey
lntague gave his life in a vain
to save  om us it delivers the
fntfo t hands we have been talk-
   ei aa morning
ractcrk-d prizc is a	p
 rery sure of your prize
  you will discover what it is soon
enough
  it is a dirty business i said harshly
how many more lives will it cost
  as many as is necessary wras his even
reply a life is but a small thing mcneil
a fortune is a fortune
  i shivered at the easy finality of his tone
he meant the words they were the key
to his character-remorseless ruthless un-
moral i knew he wtould remove me if he
thought it necessary with as little com-
punction as he would show to an insect
that crossed his path
  well ill run your engines i said
but i do it under protest ill join in the
killing of no innocent person for the sake
of goid
  i dont care what you do it under so
long as you do it he said you will still
have werner for your assistant he is a
good man but without much practical ex-
perience keep the engines running and
you will not be expected to assist us in any
other way
  jjj when i left the chart-room i
  found that the freedom of the ship
   -	was mine i had half expected the
gentle worden to attach himself to me as a
permanent escort but apparently no watch
was set upon my movements
  raider had the watch but he gave me
no other attention than a black look i re-
turned it with interest
  i ranged about the decks to obtain a full
view of the ship the uu was one of
the large cruising type of destroyers de-
veloped by naval constructors during the
past half-dozen years i had noticed a
brass plate on the chart-room bulkhead that
showed her to be less than a year in com-
mission she was about two thousand tons
displacement
  her batten consisted of four torpedo-
tubes two aft and two forward and six
rapid-fire guns of the standard british 
type arranged three to a side
  a group of four men were working upon
one of the guns and they worked as if they
understood their business they were be-
ing bossed by the navy deserter i had no-
ticed at the wheel of the ormsby-the man
with the gunners mates rating upon liis
sleeve	
  evidently  thought dacy has or-
ganized his crew upon a man-o-war basis
adventure
and rated petty officers a true guess i
soon discovered the gang had left their
carefree work-be-danined manner upon the
ormsby prompt unquestioning obedience
to orders was the rule upon the wasp
   i looked about the deck for evidences of
 the previous nights fury but the decks had
 been cleaned and there were no traces of
 the fight finally i dropped through the
 engine-room hatch and presently found my-
 self at the bottom of the engine-room lad-
 der gazing about me with satisfied ap-
proval	
   i do not think any engineer could have
 stilled a glow of contentment upon survey-
 ing the wasps engine-room it was a vi-
 sion of cleanliness and order of bright steel
 and gleaming brass the big casings that
 enclosed the turbines were clean and glis-
 tening a couple of oilers scurried about
 alive to their work the mingled odor of hot
 oil and grease and working steel met my
 nostrils pleasantly
  mr johnson stood erect between the
twin throttles and as i crossed to him he
greeted me with a smile
  goot morning chief his mild blue
eye twinkled i hope you got der pumps
fixed
   say i exclaimed of a sudden thought
 did you dismantle those pumps purposely
 yesterday afternoon
   ahe admitted easily it vas or-
 ders
   i saw another clever move in the plot
 the dismantling of the ormsbys pumps had
 kept the wasp beside the other ship and
 also had kept me from witnessing or inter-
 fering with any of the preparations for the
 attack
    well mr johnson i said i suppose
 like the rest of the crowd you are hugely
 pleased with last nights exploit
    nod johnson mr mcneil i vas lieu-
   tenant ludwig von werner vunce of der
   imperial german navy he took on a
   certain dignity of manner as he spoke i
   like nod to live under der false name und
   der need for it has passed
    very well mr lieutenant ludwig von
   werner i answered you certainly have
   a right to call yourself whatever pleases
   you but i should think that an alias would
   be best for any man mixed up in this bloody
 mcss	 	r 
    i vas nod ashamed of my name i vas
  a gentleman
  a gentlemans code does not include
murder and barratry i snorted contempt-
uously you are guilty of both
   vat care i he cried with sudden heat
 his figure stiffened and his mild eye blazed
 with an almost maniacal light i strike
 for der vatcrland der english vas mine
 enemies-dey vas der enemies of mine peo-
 ple vat care i for dead men-i care nod
 if dey all were dead me-i strike for der
 vatcrlandr
  fine sentiments i taunted but i
dare say you will take your share of the
gold this crowd is after
   his face grew red i thought for an in-
 stant he would attempt to strike me
  you insult me you make me vun of
dese he waved his hand scornfully to in-
clude the whole ship i care nod-your
words vas wrong yes i help dem ged der
gold it is for der vatcrland i do it-it vas
british gold
   where is the gold i asked
   if you nod know i tell you nodding
 he answered with a return to his accustomed
 phlegm you vas trying to pump me
 -i say no more yen will you relieve
 me
   soon i told him curtly
   i left the german and took a trip about
 the engines she was a sweet sight for a
 discriminating eye-two big turbines for
 going ahead and a third and smaller -et
 for going astern i saw the reason now for
 dacys interest in turbines everything
 was new and spick and span i made the
 mental resolve that as long as i was com-
 pelled- to take charge of the department
 the men would toe the mark and keep the
 beauties in their present condition
  i mounted to the deck and descended
into the different fire-rooms there were
six of them one for each boiler in each i
encountered the same things-the boiler
steaming the oil fires carefully tended
three men alert and competent in the per-
formance of their duties no need now to
wonder why the ormsby was overmanned
   at last i returned to the officers quar-
 ters and my room as i already thought of
 the room in which i had been imprisoned
 	was still clad in the grimy clothes i had
 labored in the night before i searched for
 and found some clean dungarees and don-
 ned them		
 as i left the room again and stepped
 into the passageway the door of the room
gold at vsea

next to mine opened and mr podd stepped
forth
   we were face to face but podd looked at
 me with unseeing eyes when i had seen
 him in the chart-room a short time before
 his face had borne the look of one who was
 suffering acutely now the deep lines were
 smoothed from his haggard face his eyes
 were alight a fixed smile was upon his bps
 and he gazed straight at me and was un-
 conscious of my presence he seemed to
 be in a happy trance i gave him good-
 morning but he stalked silently to the lad-
 der and disappeared out on deck
   when he had gone i noticed farley stand-
 ing in the ward-room entrance evidently
 drawn there by the sound of my voice he
 regarded me with a smile that was akin to a
 sneer and gave me a hail meant to be jo-
 vial perhaps which rasped my nerves
   ha mcneil he cried  would you
like a little nip of schnapps
    i jumped to his side i felt that some of
 the steam bottled up inside of me must
 blow off i reached out and took him bv
 the throat	j
   you little rat i grated ive a good
 nnnd to wring your neck
   i meant no more than to frighten him
but some of my rancor and panic crept into
my finger-tips as i squeezed he struggled
wildly and a fearful look crept into his
bulging eyes i released my grip and he
sank gaspmg to the floor
 it would serve you right if i killed you
 you dirty murderer i told him get out
 of my sight
 f icvve trrhis fct nursins his neck his
un - it 	wlth an evil rage that
 succeeded his fright
swo r yu- sai pay for this he
swore my turn is coming
vokeh ws fury he not rais ws
- 
watch d mra slowy went
on
jflh hurs  the engine-room
- sysls r houv and th t
alb but mentally i was nnv  pjhysic
xhey r p -ypsoughdtsnee
  strong dolt with no reck of consequences
  well i meditated upon the future then
   i reflected that i had made a bitter and
   powerful enemy in doctor farley and i
   heartily repented my hasty outburst of a
   few moments before i sensed keenly upon
   what a slender thread my safety hung
  i felt fear for dooin i had given the
little man my friendship and liking and the
thought of his probable condition was not
cheering true dacy had said the ormsby
was afloat and dooin was on the ormsby
but had dacy spoken truth i put nothing
beyond dacy and his gang mayhap the
ormsby was scuttled and dooinand the
men in the forehold now food for fishes it
would have been the safer course for dacy
  and with dooin gone what of my own
position if i ever regained shore safely
what predicament would i find myself in
proscribed for murder and piracjr
  for dacy had so arranged that i would
be regarded as one of the gang perhaps
in new york i was already being called
pirate and murderer my reputation with
the powers that be was none too sweet i
was a well-known filibuster my wild tale
would gain no credence i would not have
believed it from another man myself
   i was not so much afraid of death i had
 faced it often and had been long enough at
 sea to be something of a fatalist but the
 contemplation of the gallows as a means oi
 making my exit was disheartening
   the wireless was talking overhead crack-
 ling and humming dac was talking to
 some one over the rim of the sea-talking
 to the prize no doubt
  the prize what was the prize the
swiftly turning shafts sang it to me twelve
million twelve million twelve million
twelve million dollars-an unbelievable
sum what ship would carry such treasure
et i knew some ship did and that the
 ii	asp was coursing in her direction
   dacy was talking to her with the aid of
 the british navys secret code-book that
 poor montague had tried to sink in the sea
 she must be a british ship
  british gold before my minds eve
came a picture of a west street dock and
of a huge motor-truck with a covered load
and four armed men perched atop
   by heavens i cried its the maure-
 subia
   the mauresubal- it was three days now
 since i had stood before the dock gates on
adventure
west street she was preparing for sea
then she was loading treasure it must
be the maurcsubia
  but the stunning audacity of it the
maurcsubia was a thirty-thousand-ton grey-
hound to hold her up and loot her was
impossible-unthinkable vet such must
be dacys plan
   thinking about the maurcsubia and west
street it was perhaps but natural that my
thoughts should wander a bit at any
rate natural or not they did i forgot the
maurcsubia the wasp and dooin and
dacy forgot i was the quasi-prisoner of
a murderous band of thugs
  three days had but three days passed
since i stood upon west street and talked
to her-since i had seen her living face and
heard her voice was it three days since i
had met mary morrison it seemed an age
  yes i donald mcneil bucko engineer
and woman-hater stood for heaven knows
how long staring blankly at a piece of pol-
ished metal my hands caressing a withered
flower i had taken from my bosom my
thoughts mooning mistily about a lady fair
just like one of those driveling sentimental
idiots you read about in books
   and i found this occupation exceedingly
pleasant so engrossed was i that i lost
all track of the time the first intimation i
had that the hour for changing the watch
had arrived was when von werner ap-
peared at my elbow
   even then i was not at first conscious of
his presence i was endeavoring to settle
what appeared at the instant to be a mo-
mentous question-in what cheek did that
adorable dimple belong the answer was
most elusive then i had it
   her right check ill bet my boots i
ejaculated
  then it was that a grunt of surprise
brought me to my senses and i turned to
discover von werner at my elbow he
was regarding me with mild amusement
  dey vas so pleasant dreams you baf
he commented i speak dree times und
you never awake you grin with joy der
while
   i returned his salutation grumpily i felt
somewhat sheepish to have been remarked
in such a pastime even though the german
cculd have no inkling of my thoughts i
turned the watch over to him and started
up the ladder
   der captain vants to see you cruet
he called to me he vas waiting in der
ward-room for you he say for you to come
to him
etsti was late afternoon and when
i entered the ward-room the giant
turk was laying the table for sup-
per dacy was seated at the end of the
table and farley stood at his side talking
to him
  at my entrance the negro vanished
through the door in the after wall that led
to the pantry farley hesitated an instant
then followed turk favoring me with a ma-
lignant glare through his glasses as he passed
me i was alone with the captain
  mcneil he said abruptly i under-
stand that you assaulted the doctor this
morning i gather you attempted to wring
his neck
  he brought it upon himself i an-
swered he knew no better than to taunt
a raw-tempered man he asked me to drink
some schnapps
   mcneil do you fully realize your posi-
tion
  what do you mean i asked
  i mean that you are acting foolishly
whether you will or no you are one of us
why not play the game what sense is
there in antagonizing your shipmates
  they are no shipmates of mine i
flashed i am glad if i have convinced
them of the fact
  you have he said grimly there are
a dozen men on the ship who would delight
to bun- steel in you your hazing has given
you ill favor and you have made an enemy
of farley
  are you warning me that mv life is in
danger i asked
   no while i command your life is safe
so long as you obey my orders but if you
are detected in any overt act against my
authority you will be eliminated and do
not make the mistake of thinking that any
hostile move on your part will not be
noted
   well you are the upper dog i saia
  come come mcneil he laughed
do not allow your resentment to sour
your disposition look at this matter dis-
passionately
   look at it from your angle i suggested
with sarcasm
  yes you might as well have the game
as the name mcneil be sensible and join
gold at sea

us and share in the loot it means a for-
tune for you
  and the gallows i added
  it probably will mean the gallows if you
do not cast with us he replied but we
are not worrying about the gallow-s the
disposal of the prize and our own getaway
is already arranged for as i have told you
we have friends in high places ashore we
will be taken care of think of the prize
yes i am thinking of it i said i
am wondering how many more lives this
mad business is going to cost your prize
is the mauresubia is it not
  so you have guessed that he laughed
yes it is the mauresubia it will do no
harm to let you know that now
  man are you crazy i burst out the
mauresubia is one of the largest ships afloat
shell have over a thousand men in her
crew how can you expect to get gold out
of her
  easily he answered that is the easi-
est part of the whole thing-the taking of
the gold away from the mauresubia i
doubt if a drop of blood be spilt if that
is all that worries you mcneil ou may
set your mind at rest we will get the gold
come give me your word to join whole-
heartedly with us remember there is a
fortune for you in it
  a fortune in it yes i remembered i
thought of the things i could do with a for-
tune with a fortune even dreams might
come true
  nor had i any doubt but that the gang
had their escape carefully planned nor that
they would not probably make it oh i
thought of it and i was tempted and
then i thought of the still figures i had seen
huddled on the decks the night before and
thencallous burial in the sea cold-blood-
ed killings for the sake of gold i thought
ot the other killings that would probably
gold whcn lllg effort was mafle to get the
lno  exploded ill join freely in no
l-iii  arne as yu are running i have
mnrvi	rd my time but  bave never
forcedt  frn your ensine because i am
z  aid you no further-not if
  dacy shrugged his shoulders
disannnfr   he sad and thcre was rcal
hasmenvn his voice- j would
would ht r you for a rigbt-hand man-y
would be trustworthy
ou
  he sat a while silent toying with some-
thing in his hand he had been fingering
it during the conversation-a trinket of
gold i noticed suddenly he addressed me
again his pleasant confidential manner
gone his voice icy sharp
  remember mcneil your first move
against me will be your last move
  he recommenced his toying with the
trinket he looked at it and of a sudden
his face lost its harshness and became won-
drously soft i stared at him with amaze-
ment
  he looked up
  mcneil why are you iooking at me in
that fashion he demanded am i a
ghost
  why i stammered you look like-
you resemble some one i faltered who
the devil did he resemble
  he smiled with a sudden return of his
good humor
  ive noticed that queer stare from you
several times he said
  he was about to add more when a sud-
den uproar in the pantry at our backs dis-
tracted our attention
  oh lawdy oh lawdy came the ter-
rified accents of the negros voice
  the door of the pantry burst open and
turk tumbled into the room his shiny
face was contorted with fright
  oh lawdy oh lawdy he gasped
deys a ghost in de storeroom its one o
dem we killed deys a spirut in de store-
room
  captain captain came farleys voice
here quick-a stowaway
  dacy leaped to his feet and dashed
through the pantry door i was about to
follow when i noticed upon the floor the
trinket dacy had been playing with he
had dropped it in liis haste i stooped to
pick it up to save it from damage
  i straightened up and stood as one petri-
fied the trinket was a miniature portrait
a girls face set in a gold frame
  it was the face of my dreams that smiled
up at me from the picture it was the face
of mary morrison
  i stared at the miniature i was too sur-
prised for the instant to even wonder at its
presence upon the	the sight of that
picture made me dimly realize for the first
time just how large a portion of my thoughts
that beautiful face had occupied during the
hurly-burly of the past three days
io
adventure
 then came distraction in the shape of a
 voice from the pantry raised in accents of
 earnest pleading
  ow guvnarh dont kill me shelp
me i aint done nothing ow guvnarh
dont kill me
   hardly conscious of the act i dropped
 the miniature into my pocket then i
 turned to face the procession that emerged
 from the pantry
   farley came first and behind him was
 dacy holding by the scruff of the neck a
 squirming pleading figure the captive
 was dressed in the white uniform of the
 british navy and he was thickly coated
 with hour a ghostly appearing figure true
 enough turk crouching in the corner
 gave a grunt of terror
   oh lawd de spirut
  dacy gave his prisoner a shove that
bounced him the length of the table and
then stood regarding him sternly i caught
my first glimpse of the fellows face and
almost cried aloud
   it was dooin
xi
it was dooin-or his twin
   he cringed before dacy in a funk
 clouds of flour dusted off his clothes
 when he spoke it was not with dooins
 jaunty american crispness but in the bar-
 barous cockney accents of west india dock
 road it was dooins body right enough
 but the man was a stranger
  who are you demanded dacy
   ow dont kill me guvnarh pleaded
 the fellow hi aint done nothink to you
 guvnarh
   who are you interjected farley
 captains man sir was the answer
 hi was captains man sir an doing stew-
 ards duty sir
   he is montagues valet said farley to
dacy
   yes sir affirmed the prisoner eagerly
 hi was captain montagues man sir
 how did you get into that storeroom
 demanded dacy
   hi id there was the nervous reply
 hi was doing stewards duty sir when
 the fighting cyme hi run in the storeroom
 an id in the flour-bin	
   the little man recounted his inglorious
 retreat with great earnestness i tried to
 catch his eye but his attention was all for
 dacy
   hi didnt do nothink against you guv-
narh he repeated
  i decided it could not be dooin-merely
a remarkable resemblance of face
  turk advanced from his corner and in-
spected the little fellow critically turks
fear was quite dissipated now he was as-
sured the ghostly figure was human
  sho he declaimed disgustedly is
dat what it am datlitrunt lawdy-he
done looked eight feet high when he bobbed
outa dat flour-box all white like dat
  well what shall we do with him re-
marked dacy to farley over the side
   it might be well assented farley
   ow guvnarh was the piteous plea i
didnt do nothink to you sir in my bunk
hi was guvnarh plyin  earts o hoak
on a mouth-horgan when the fight cyme
hi id hi didnt urt any of your blokes
guvnarh
  he regarded dacy anxiously dacys
face was stern
  him a prisoner o war guvnarh hi
surrender we dont kill you blokes when
we captures them guvnarh
   a glimmering of the situation seemed to
strike him suddenly
  blimme-you chaps aint germans he
cried
  never mind about that said dacy
what is your name
   harchibald dooin sir was the reply
  the words struck me like a blow i
stared at him over dacys shoulder and
seemed to get just the flutter of an eyelid
  we might make use of him remarked
farley turk has too much work to do
and this man is a servant let him help
the nigger	
   yes sir-him a good steward sir eag-
erly proclaimed the prisoner
  very well assented dacy he shot a
terrifying glance at the cringing figure
but remember-if you make one crooked
move over the side you go under-
stand
   yes sir kew sir hi understand hi m
a prisoner o war working for my keep hi
wont do nothink against you blokes gawd
strike me pink the little cockney asserted
solemnly
 dacy laughed	
  all right turk take him along wuh
you he addressed the negro make him
dean himself before you put him to work
  turk reached out and graspea doom
gold at sea

lirmly by the arm and the two disappeared
through the pantry door
and so when henderson present-
ly joined us and we all sat down to
the meal it was dooin who deftly
waited upon the board a strange dooin
with -a timid manner and the outward ap-
pearance of a british seaman
    ere you are sir arve a bit o this
sir kew sir this was the extent of his
speech throughout the meal
  he flew between the galley and the pan-
try and the pantry and the table in his
eagerness to make a good impression he
waited upon us like a man bred to the job
   several times i caught his eye but not a
glimmer of recognition could i discern there
if it was a disguise it was wonderful-a
change of character not of feature mr
harchibald dooin had me guessing
  after the meal i went below to the en-
gine-room and relieved von werner for a
couple of hours a busy two hours they
proved for the wasps speed had been in-
creased to thirty knots and the engines
compelled my whole attention
  when i returned to the ward-room the
table had been cleared of the dinner debris
dooin was nowhere in sight save for podd
the room was deserted
   podd slouched upon the divan in the cor-
ner head on breast brooding deeply
hello i said all alone
  he looked up and i was shocked by the
expression on his face it was an expres-
sion of hopeless despair and his face was
furrowed with deep lines of suffering he
looked utterly wretched
   what is the matter i asked
   he shook his head dejectedly
    mcneil he said did you ever have a
million maggots feasting upon your brain
did every atom of your being ever writhe
with desire
   i was too surprised by his strange words
to answer he suddenly leaped to his feet
 it you had ever felt it he continued
   you would know what hell is like
   he stood staring at me for an instant his
   <?>rkin- lis shoulders twitching
    my god my god he muttered in some
inward agony
  abruptly he brushed past me and strode
jroni the room then i heard the door of
his room across the passage slam shut be-
hind him

  but i had small thought to waste upon
mr podds vagaries i waited a short time
hoping for the appearance of the new stew-
ard and then went to my own room i
looked about the room for a message and
found none i threw myself into a chair
stumped
  it was dooin-surely it was dooin it
was merely a disguise the speech and the
clothes but how had he reached the wasp
where did he get the clothes why had he
not recognized me and at least tipped me a
wink no it was no disguise it was too
perfect but the name and the face
  so ran my mind i happened to thrust
my hand into my coat-pocket i felt some-
thing hard and round and i drew out the
miniature
  i had forgotten about the picture but
now as i regarded it my thoughts changed
their direction abruptly i gazed upon
that dainty smiling resemblance and my
troubles faded from my consciousness i
was alone with mary morrison
  her picture how like and yet how un-
like the beautiful living face i remembered
so well yes even in this portrait a laugh
seemed to tremble on the smiling lips and
the eyes seemed fathomless
  her picture how came her picture into
dacys hands-he a black-hearted criminal
with murder on his head surely the west
street girl had nothing to do with him
  yet the expression on his face when he
had looked upon the portrait had been an
avowal that he knew her and knew her
dearly what was she to him what busi-
ness was it of mine
  i brought myself up with a jerk as i real-
ized that i was subjecting to a jealous scru-
tiny the probable acts of a young woman i
did not know and then staring at the
face i recommenced my mooning
  hist came from seemingly over my
shoulder
  i jumped and whirled about the room
was empty
  hist came from above my head
  i stared about me bewildered
  up here mcneil up here came in soft
accents
  my eyes searched for the voice over-
head through the room ran an air-duct
part of the ventilating system of the ship
it was of heavy galvanized iron about four-
teen by eighteen inches in size and it was
affixed to the ceiling with iron bracec a
adventure
small round offshoot from the parent pipe
some eight inches in diameter afforded fresh
air for the room  was in
  it was from this offshoot as from a pho-
nograph-horn that the mysterious voice
came
  i stepped close and brought my face on a
level with the ventilator opening through
the small pipe i could dimly see the bulk of
a human body lying in the duct
  hello i said im here
  good sport was the answer this is
dooin
  dooin i exclaimed then confound
you youre not a cockney
  guess i kind of got your goat came
through the pipe couldnt help it-i
didnt dare recognize you
  how did you get into that pipe i
asked
  it runs past my bunk he informed me
there is an opening there where it joins
the pipe that runs along the other side of
the ship  crawled through and made my
way along until i saw you i didnt dare
try to see you openly
  we commenced a series of questions and
answers i recounted all that had hap-
pened to me since i had last spoken wilh
him the day before he told me of his own
movements
  i waited for you to come and see me
last night he said after they had trans-
ferred the stores they turned out all the
lights  crawled out of the life-boat and
hid in the shadow beneath it i saw them
moving around the decks but i didnt
dream of the job they were up to in fact
i had come to the conclusion that every-
thing was aboveboard  reasoned that if
those jaspers were going to pull off any
crooked stunts it would be after the de-
parture of the war-ship
  then he told how he had heard dacys
call for help during my struggle in the
ormsbys cabin and had seen them bring
me out and shackle me to the stanchion
but in the darkness he could not distin-
guish features and since i had been unable
to make any noise he had not known what
occurred the attack on the wasp was a
stupendous surprise to him
  when they had commenced to transfer
the prisoners to the ormsby the search-light
was switched from the ii asp v after-decks
to the ormsbys fore-decks i hat left the
stern portion of the destroyer in black
shadow i took a chance was the way
dooin put it he climbed down from the
loat-skids slid down a rope to the haps
deck and made his way below to the offi-
cers quarters the place was deserted and
he had secreted himself in the storeroom
  but the clothes-and the accent i
asked
  got them this morning  he replied
the stewards bunk is just off the pantry
the clothes were there they fitted me and
i put them on i knew i would be discov-
ered sooner or later and i had to mask my
identity it was easy ive played the
cockney before
    told him of my conversations with dacy
and my discovery of dacys objective
  it is the mauresubia i said the
gold is there and they are going after it
they have their escape all planned dacy
mentioned powerful friends ashore
  thats oates he means commented
dooin
   i dont know how they expect to get the
loot away from the mauresubiai added
but they can capture the liner easily
enough dacy captured the british naval
code-book last night and by means of it
he has been in communication with the
mauresubia by wireless she is waiting for
us to come up with her she expects the
wasp to act as her convoy
   they are slick all right swore dooin
when does the show come off
  dont know tomorrow i think
well i must hustle back to my bunk
before that big coon misses me
  but what shall we do  asked
   is there a chance to reach the wireless
and send a message
  no i answered wireless plant is in
the chart-room and somebody is always
there
  then we can do nothing for the pres-
ent he stated
   but think of what happened last night 
i exclaimed my god dooin there must
be women and children on board the maurc-
subia
   it wont do them any good for us to get
our throats slit was his rejoinder do
nothing rash mcneil obey their orders
until we see a chance to queer lheir game
holy smoke this is the biggfc job i ever
heard of there must be a weak spot some-
where in their armor
  and what if we reach the maxresulia
gold at sea
before you find the weak spot i de-
manded
  do nothing he admonished let
them go ahead and get the boodle we
couldnt prevent them anyway our chance
will come to spoil this little jaunt i can
use this pipe here to spy upon every room
in the quarters-be strange if i dont dis-
cover something we can turn to our advan-
tage but we must pull the wool over their
eyes mcneil whatever you do dont give
us away
  all right i assented ill wait for
you to make the break say you recall
that girl i helped on west street that
blackguard dacy had her picture in his
possession i have it here what can that
crook have in common with miss morri-
son he must have stolen it somewhere
why she was the truest-looking most-
  huh no doubt no doubt grunted
dooin well i must beat it back to my
little bed before my ethiopian boss starts
gum-shoeing after me remember mac
go easy so long
  the voice ceased and the body in the
duct slid out of sight straining my ears
against the opening of the ventilator i
could hear above the ship noises the rustle
of dooins body as he dragged himself
through the pipe
  good night i called softly
  i turned to my own bed i was almost
happy a great load had been lifted from
my mind i had faith in dooin
xii
i was due on watch at two oclock
in the morning but it was nearly
four oclock before i was called
when i reached the engine-room i discov-
ered the reason for the two hours grace
  youi vill be on watch der whole day
maybe von werner informed me i vill
be otherwise engaged
  he left me a prey to all sorts of nervous
conjectures the intermittent buzzing of
the wireless overhead added to my excite-
ment
thaltfrn as was daylight i left the
  a an instanl  climbed to the
deck a swift search of the horizon re-
warded me with a glimpse of a faint far
smoke-smudge in the northern sky our
dows were pointed toward it
  my moment on deck appraised me also
of a bustle of preparation throughout the
ship the whole crew was astir
  the yo-heave-ho of a crowd working
aft directed my attention toward our stern
the hatch to the aftermost compartment
was open and a gang under raiders com-
mand was engaged in whipping boxes of
stores and ammunition out upon the deck
i divined instantly that they were making
room for a more precious cargo even as i
looked the gang began to jettison the pile
on the deck
  farther aft a couple of men were over-
hauling the gear of the whale-boat which
swung in davits the only small boat the
wasp possessed the united states navy
deserter was working upon the amidship
gun and i saw some live shells nose up-
ward on the deck behind him
  i dropped back into the engine-room just
in time to receive an order from the bridge
to increase the speed open her up and
drive her came dacys voice through the
speaking-tube i rang to the fire-rooms for
steam and in a few moments the h as was
racking herself with a thirty-six knot
gait
  a little while later dooin appeared in
the hatchway above he bore my breakfast
on a tray and nimbly negotiated the de-
scent of the ladder with one free hand
   ere you are sir-kew sir was his
greeting
  he placed the food on the log-desk as-
sured himself that he could not be over-
heard by one of the oilers and continued in
his own voice
  there is a big black four-funnel steam-
er a few miles ahead of us she is stopped
  it is the mauresubiasaid i w aiting
for us to come up with her
  there are great doings on deck added
dooin those sports are up to some more
slick work
  what now i asked
  they are parading around dressed up
like germans he answered they are
all dressed in german navy uniforms
dacy is swelled up like a dutch admird
  good lord they must be going to
pass themselves off as germans i ex-
claimed
  where did they get the duds asked
dooin
  the memory of the two big packing-cases
i had seen transferred from the omsbys
forecastle to the	forecastle flashed
adventure
across my inind dacy had mentioned uni-
forms when they had been produced
  they brought them from new york 
told dooin they had them on the orms-
by
  well they are all fixed up like dutch-
men now he said  guess those sports
on the maurcsubia will get the surprise of
their lives in a few moments so long-ive
got to beat it
  we came up with the prize rapidly
twenty minutes after dooin had left me i
received a sigual-bell to slow the starboard
engine i knew we were turning a second
bell directed me to slow both engines a third
bell to stop
  i swung shut the throttles and in the
same instant the ship shook from stem to
stern from gun fire overhead-four shots in
rapid succession
  i leaped for the ladder at the first shot
and the concussion from the last one lifted
the cap from my head as i reached the deck
  the mauresubia lay close aboard on our
port side not more than five hundred yards
distant she lay motionless towering above
the water like a sky-scraper above the side-
walk her decks were filled with rushing
gesticulating figures both of her topmasts
had been shot awray and the whole fabric
of her wireless was jumbled along her hur-
ricane-deck
  the gang on the wasp was cheering
each of the three guns in the port batten
was manned and the smoke still trailed
from the amidship gun where the navy
deserter had his eye glued to ihe sights i
looked forward up to our signal yard ran
a ball of bunting a jerk of the halyard
and it broke into the german naval colors
  dooin had spoken truth every man in
sight upon the wasps deck with the ex-
ception of myself was dressed in a german
uniform raider dashed past me going aft
he was dressed as a german officer an-
other man garbed as officer appeared upon
the wing of our bridge with a megaphone
it was von werner he bellowed across
the intervening strip of water to the maure-
subia
  you vas summoned to surrender to der
imperial german government if you do
nod so we vill sink you
  all right all right came the answering
hail for gods sake dont lire into us
again-we have women and children on
board
  yon werner descended the bridge and
hurried aft followed by dacy if the uni-
form had metamorphosed the german an
even more startling change had been effect-
ed in dacys appearance he wore the uni-
form of a commander in the german navy
and his mustaches were waxed and trained
into the fierce upward thrust affected by
the teutonic military his iron features
and his carriage were typical of the prussian
aristocrat
  raider and a crew of men were getting
the whaleboat into the water toward
them hurried von werner and dacy
  the wasp was drifting astern a bell
from the bridge called me back to the en-
gine-room for several moments i was
busy with the engines while henderson
worked the ship back into position
  when next i poked my head through the
hatchway the whaleboat was bobbing at
the maurcsubias side dacy and yon wer-
ner were ascending a rope-ladder to the
liners decks the liners rails were black
with people watching the ascent and the
panic had passed
  then a bell from the bridge recalled me
to my duties below it was in this broken
fashion a moment now and then that i
witnessed the looting of the mauresubia
of what happened on the mauresubias
decks i learned nothing until long after-
ward when i read the newspaper version
  this told hov the mauresubia awaited
the arrival of h m s wasp upon the re-
ceipt of code wireless messages announcing
that the	was to act as the mauresu-
bias convoy until she reached the grand
banks how upon the	appearance
she steamed close and fired into the liner
sending both topmasts by the board and
wounding the first and fifth officers how it
was discovered that the wasp was in the
enemys possession
 how commander yon schlossman and
lieutenant von werner boarded the liner
and while commander yon schlossman in
broken english demanded possession of the
specie in the liners strong-box lieutenant
yon werner invaded the wireless-room and
utterly demolished the apparatus with a
fire-ax how captain lorens of the man-
resubia with the weight of three thousand
lives upon his shoulders and helpless before
the menace of the destroyers guns cold
do nothing but accede to the german itn-
cers demands how commander  on
gold at sea
schlossman thereupon produced manifests
containing an accurate description of the
contents of the liners strong-room
  how the german captain was recognized
by one of the mauresubias passengers and
promptly took drastic and unheard-of meas-
ures as a result
  of all this i saw or knew nothing my
duties kept me intermittently busy with
the engines only occasionally could i dash
up the ladder and snatch a quick look
around
  i saw the mauresubias steam launch and
two of her lifeboats being lowered into the
water men from the whaleboat manned
them instantly
  i looked about for dooin but he was no-
where in sight
  on my next trip up the ladder i found
the steam launch with one of the lifeboats
in tow lying by our side the lifeboat was
laden with a cargo of small wooden boxes
bound with iron straps there were not
many of them but their weight bore the
lifeboat almost gunwale under
  the boxes were passed aboard and rai-
der and his gang received them with whoops
and cheers they dispatched them through
the hatch into the after compartment
where they had earlier made room by jet-
tisoning stores
  on board the mauresubia they were low-
ering more boxes into the second lifeboat
the ikajpi whaleboat lay on her oars a
short distance from the liners side and in
the slern-sheets i noticed an alien figure
wrapped in a cloak but i was too much
excited by the sight of the little wooden
boxes to comment upon this
   hey fascinated me those little square
boxes all the same size all bound with
iron straps to and fro hour after hour
the launch steamed between the liner and
our side towing the lifeboats each trip
brought us a fortune
  i he boxes seemed innumerable i never
knew their exact number but there were
hundreds of them raider and his men la-
bored like demons in trans-shipping the
treasure and getting it safely stowed in the
after compartment expeditiously and
without a single hitch the work proceeded
  throughout the entire time the gun-
crews remained at the wasps guns and kept
the weapons trained upon the mauresubias
vitals they were a deadly threat that the
maurcsubias officers did well to heed
 the transfer of the gold took most
 of the morning not a surprising
 circumstance when you consider
 that more than twenty-five tons of the metal
 were handled it was after eleven oclock
 when a final rousing cheer appraised me
 that the task was completed when next i
 peered through the hatchway raiders gang
 was clamping down the after hatch
   the mauresubia was hoisting inboard her
 launch and the whaleboat was returning
 to our side in the stern-sheets sat dacy
 and von werner and between them was
 wedged a slight boyish figure wrapped in a
 cloak
   i had no chance to witness their arrival
 for hendersons imperative jangle recalled
 me to my work soon from my station on
 the floor-plates i heard the yo-ho-ho of
 the men hoisting the whaleboat aboard
 immediately afterward i received the sig-
 nal to go astern
   we backed slowly and stopped again
 suddenly the ship trembled from the shock
 and roar of one of the guns two-three
 shots the horrible thought hit me they
 are sinking her i left the throttles and
 leaped for the ladder
   our backing had brought us opposite the
 mauresubias stern her great half-round
 hull towered opposite us panic was again
 rife upon her decks her officers were
 wildly hailing from her bridge
   our amidship gun still wreathed smoke
 and the navy gunner had it trained upon a
 spot beneath the liners counter i followed
 the direction of the muzzle with my eyes
 and saw that the liners rudder had been
 shot away
   dacy was standing by the gun a pleased
 expression on his face
   she s crippled i heard him exclaim
 with her wireless and rudder gone she
 wont be able to bother us shell make
 slow headway steering with her propellers
 we may not be reported for a couple of
 days
   i ducked below again in a few moments
 came the order for full speed ahead and
 the added urge through the speaking-tube
 to drive her i had a full head of steam
 and i opened her up in a few moments
 we were racing away from the crippled liner
 at a thirty-six knot clip
   three hours longer i stayed on watch ere
  on vv erner came my oilers were relieved
 and the men who took their places were
adventure
part of the whaleboats crew t was burst-
ing with curiosity but i could not bring
myself to question them but i could see
that they were drunken with the thought
of what they had helped do the thought
of it made my own brain reel
   twenty-five tons of gold twelve mil-
lions of dollars
   dacy had achieved the impossible the
treasure was his beneath our hatches were
the little square boxes with the iron straps
twelve million-a fortune for each man
   and unbidden the insidious thought
crept into my mind you need but to keep
your mouth shut and you too will have a
fortune to spend you too will share in
the cutting of the melon
  but would i would i who had kept
aloof from the gang be considered in the
division of the spoils i felt sure i would
be dacy was a man to keep his word he
had promised me two hundred thousand
dollars what could i not do with such a
sum how pleasant life would be
   and then i thought of dooin and of the
promise i had given the little man i cursed
myself for a knave for even idly dreaming
such thoughts and gave my full attention
to my work
   the nursing of the engines soon occupied
my full attention without any effort of
mind the command came from the bridge
to shake her out-drive her till the rivets
rattle i obeyed i drove her until she
shook from stem to stern with the vibra-
tion i took an unreasonable but to an
engineer a natural delight in my task and
its results thirty-six thirty-six and a half
thirty-seven when von werner appeared
to relieve me i was getting a full knot and
a quarter more than the builders best out
of the wasp
  von werner had discarded his german
uniform for his dungarees instead of his
face being suffused with a glow of triumph
as i had expected he wore a troubled
look
   i suppose you arc- overjoyed i re-
marked you have got the gold and are
making the escape
   he shook his head
    vas nod joyous he said der gold
ja dot vas good but der woman-dot vas
   what are you talking about i asked
  der woman-dot vas bad captain
daev bring to tlic vasp back a woman
she vas young uud a lady  like it nod
a woman  cried do you mean to
say that there ii a woman on board
  uja from der mauresubia he bring her
she vas his sweetheart berhaps she rec-
ognize him und cry und he bring her away
it vas for safety-yet i like it nod she
vas young und a lady und it vas bad to
bring her together with dis hell-scum
   i clid not like it either though at first i
was more curious than troubled it seemed
a devilish thing to bring a woman amidst
these desperate men i wonderc l what she
was like but yon werner could only assert
that she was young and a lady
  by this time the mauresubia had long
since been left beneath the northern hori-
zon the  asp was racing southward and
when i reached the deck i found it difficult
to maintain a footing so great was the vi-
bration from the speeding engines the
decks were wet with spindrift from the tre-
mendous bone the <;?/> carried in her
teeth our wake was a lane of white water
the deck-plates actually heaved beneath
ones feet
   but these visible signs of our great speed
i merely noticed subconsciously as i made
my way to the cabin-hatch it was an old
experience for me i had seen it l ei - t-- many
times i was hungry and i bent iny steps
directly toward the ward-room where i
knew food would be upon the table
  turk and dooin were in the ward-room
and the meal was awaiting me as i had ex-
pected
    ere you are sir greeted dooin in his
best cockneyse just tyke this chair sir
arve you dinner hall ready an piping ot
just tyke a bit o this sir gyve some to
the ivdy an it elperl her a lot
  what is that i said as turk passed
out of ear-shot into the pantry is there
really a woman on board
  yep and a pippin too he answered
shes a friend of yours maybe
  but who is she-where is she i aked
search me who she is was his easy re-
sponse shes a swell-looking dam- all
riht shes in the captains room dacy
turned it over to her he bustled about
placing food upon a tray say i got some
news ive found out something that will
turn to our advantage i think i have to
take this tray up to the bridge afterward
ill duck into your room and wait for you
ive got something to show you
gold at sea
   he balanced his tray on his hand and de-
parted for the deck i applied myself to
the meal speculating upon the nature of
the news dooin had for me
  i heard a gasp and lifted my eyes the
sight i encountered brought me to my feet
with a sharp cry of astonishment
  framed in the ward-room door was a
woman she was staring at me with wide-
open eyes and parted lips it was my dream
woman-it was mar morrison
xiii
you she gasped
you i echoed
we stared as if each were an ap-
parition
  for the moment i could not think could
not wonder i simply stared mouth agape
and realized the stupendous fact that this
girl who had so strangely filled my mind
during the past days was again before me
in the living flesh
  she advanced into the room and as she
came toward me i had the crazy fleeting
notion that she was but another fantasy ol
m mind and that she would presently dis-
solve into the nothingness she came from
she grasped the back of a chair to steady
herself against the uneasy motion of the
ship and i saw the pink of her knuckles
whiten under the pressure of her grip still
i stared at her incapable of connected
thought
  her body trembled more than the hevy
vibration of the engines made necessary
her bosom heaved unevenly her face was
haggard in spite of its youthful freshness
about her eyes were reddened circles the
great crown of her hair was a tumbled mass
oi gold yet the disorder but enhanced her
loveliness
  her eyes were moist-misty with tears
and in their depths i seemed to glimpse de-
spair and a biting sorrow she leaned over
the back of the chair and looked at me in-
tently
you here with roger she said oh-
i thought you were different i dreamed
that you oh why are you all evil she
brushed passionately
you dreamed-you too have dream-
ed i babbled grasping at the word
vou too have dreamed and could not
help yourself
  i-i thought that you-
   she paused and i became conscious that
 her face was crimsoned and that a fright-
 ened uncertain glance was in her regard
 then her eyes grew hard and bright and
 she spoke incisively
   i do not dream of rogues i had a grate-
 ful remembrance of your service to me i
 thought you were a gentleman and now i
 find you here with this crowd oh i
 thought-
   she faltered two great tears rolled out
 of the corners of her eyes and coursed down
 her cheeks
   her words were a splash of cold water
 upon the face of my consciousness they
 shocked me to a sudden awakening to the
 situation
   my god i cried was it you they
 brought from the mauresubia and then
 with the evidence of her person before me
 i was aware of the inanity of the query
 the devil i swore by heavens ill
 kill the man-
   stop she cried oh the shame-al-
 ready you would fight over me like a dog
 over a bone
   no no you misunderstand i exclaim-
 ed if that blackguard daev harms
 you-
   stop she cried again i do not know
 what position you occupy here mr mc-
 neil but i presume thatyou are subordi-
 nate to the man you are vilifying it is a
 mean thing to malign a man behind his
 back
   i stared at her astounded the transfor-
 mation was instantaneous and complete
 she stood with head thrown back and her
 figure quivering with resentment her
 words were hot with anger
   but but i blundered on the vile
 cur-
   how dare you she blazed oh
 i  not listen to such a cowardly attack
 upon the character of a better man than
 yourself you would not dare to face him
 with such words
   she hurled the words at me vehemently
 and with a wealth of contempt in her voice
 i hen she turned and rushed from the room
 into the passage and i heard the door of
 uacy s room close behind her
   for many minutes i stood staring blank-
 jy at the door through which she passed
 my brain numbed and stupid with the shock
 of her appearance and tempestuous depar-
 ture finally i recovered control over my
adventure
legs if not of my wits and made my way
to my own room
dooin was seated upon the edge
of my bunk awaiting my appear-
ance with visible impatience
thought you would never come he
greeted been waiting fifteen minutes
dooin i have just seen the girl i ex-
claimed good heavens do you know
who she is she is the west street girl-
the girl i told you about
  oh yes he returned unmoved did-
nt i say she was a friend of yours
  but the girl-that girl i raced on
they have kidnapped her think of the
position she is in good god man what
will-
  huh-dont you worry about her mac
he interrupted dacy will take care of
her-shes his doll
    obeyed an irresistible impulse i reach-
ed out and throttled the little man shook
him like a terrier shakes a rat
  hey-you fool easy what are you
trying to do he panted
   the gust of passion passed and i relaxed
my grasp dooin sank into a chair clutch-
ing at his throat
   gee but you are a sudden gink he ob-
served what is eating you anyway
how dare you refer to that young lady
as an intimate of dacys
  huh holy smoke i didnt know that
dame had your goat dacy knows her i
tell you-knows her well enough to kiss her
anyway hey-keep away from me try
that again and ill bust you over the head
with this bottle its the truth i saw him
do it and he moved out and gave her his
own room
  again the flame flared within me i
clenched my fists but with an effort kept
myself from seizing the little man
  you lit-i say you lie i cried she
is a prisoner
   all right all right tll take your word
for it he answered i didnt know you
knew her very well i thought you just
saw her the one time
  that makes no difference i retorted
i tell you  know-i tell you she is a lady
gee i didnt know she had you going
like that was his answer all right she
is beauty in distress but dont you worry
about her safety i saw her and dacy to-
gether and he is her friend
 i dont care what you saw she is true
 blue and-
 sure and a yard wide bui say dont
 you go too much on first impressions tin y
 arent worth a darn where women are con-
 cerned
 do you mean to intimate-
 intimate nothing said dooin i
 dont know anything about her and any-
 how i didnt sneak in here to talk about
 her this is what brought me here
 he pointed and i noticed a cigar-box
 lying upon my bunk dooin picked it up
 and tapped it significantly
 i have it here he stated
 have what i asked
 mr podds little peculiarities he an-
 swered
 i regarded the box with uncomprehend-
 ing interest and for the moment the girl
 slipped into the back of my mind
 what do you mean  asked
 dooin raised the lid i saw that the box
 was about half filled with cigarette-papers
 twisted into pellets
 what do you think of that remarked
 dooin triumphantly
 he took one of the pellets in his hand
 and untwisted the paper then he oitered
 the contents for my inspection
 what do you call it he demanded
 i shook my head
 looks like flour-or snow
 snow-thats just what it is
 i looked at him rather blankly
 it is podds ioy-stuff he continued
 there is enough snow here to make a man
 see rosy for a month its dope-coke-
 cocaine you know friend podd in on the
 junk he takes cocaine
 i looked at the white powder curiouslv
 so here was the reason for podds moodi-
 ness and flights of queer fancy but how
 did it affect dooin and myself
 well what of it i asked
 what of it he mimicked say-did
 you ever have anything to do with a dope-
 fiend
 no i answered
 well when a man is on the junk espe-
 cially when he is a cocaine floater-he is a
 nut does that suggest anything to you
 no i said i told you the other day
 that podd was bughouse
 dooin regarded me sorrowfully
 shes stolen your wit he bemoaned 
 what are you driving at i demandcu
gold at sea

  i see ill have to educate you he com-
menced briskly i am going to impart a
secret of my profession
  when we want to get a guy mac we
look for his weak spot a criminal always
has a weak spot usually it is either dope
or booze or women-sometimes all three
when you know a mans weakness you have
a hold upon him i spotted podd for a
dope-user the first time i saw him i think
i could name dacys weakness-a short
word that begins s-h-e-
  stop it i interjected
  sure-and about nine-tenths of the
gang could be reached through booze
  dope is the leverage we can use upon
mr podd it is the best-or the worst-
of the three a dope-fiend is a slave and
anybody who can control liis drug supply
is his master-master of his body and his
soul podd is an old floater all the better
for us with his dope shut off he will be
as crazy as a loon and as pliable as putty
in less than twenty-four hours
  yes but what good will that do us i
demanded we cant do anything podd
is no sort of an addition to our fighting
strength
  fight fight-thats all you can think
of complained dooin we dont intend
to fight here is the plan the ormsby
has been adrift all day hasnt she and
we are near the coast in waters that are
crowded with coastwise craft the chances
are that the ormsby has already been sight-
ed and the piracy of this craft made known
perhaps the mauresubia will meet some
ship
  the mauresubia should be able to reach
the coast some time tomorrow i said
she will make slow time with her rudder
disabled she will have to steer with her
propellers but she should be able to com-
municate her news by this time tomorrow
at the latest even if she speaks no ship of
course both ships wireless were destroyed
but the ilasa wireless is in good con-
dition said dooin
   you mean to force podd to send a mes-
sage i exclaimed as the drift of the little
man s talk suddenly reached me
          j see a glimmer of reason is return-
mg to you he said yes exactly as
soon as this affair becomes known there
will be plenty of searchers after dacy we
must get an s o s out some way
    but what goodwill that do  objected
we dont know where we are going-we
have no position to give the atlantic
ocean is a pretty big place
  cant you make a guess
  no how can i all i know is that we
were about four hundred miles north of
new yorks latitude when we held up the
mauresubia we are bound south now at
full speed we are about three hundred
miles off shore
  where will we be this time tomorrow
somewhere off the north carolina coast
if dacy keeps to his present course there
is one thing i do know-we cant keep up
our present gait for forty hours longer
this ships steaming radius is c miles
but that is at an economical speed driving
the boilers the way we are now the oil will
last less than two days but dacy can
make some  miles before then noth-
ing save one of our own navys new destroy-
ers could overhaul this craft
  then we must get one after us said
dooin dacy is bound for some place to
get rid of the gold we must find out where
in some way i am going to use that ven-
tilator - pipe again - maybe   overhear
something we have twenty-four hours to
wait before podd will be in a condition for
us to approach him
  you are sure we can force him to do our
will
  i know it ive handled dopes before
it all depends though upon whether or not
he can get any of the stuff from others i
rifled the medicine-chest in the ward-room
and removed all the morphia and cocaine it
contained but farley or some of the crowd
forward might have some i dont think
so though none of them look like drug-
users
  how did you get possession of the
stull i asked
  i had podd spotted for a fiend and was
waiting for my chance he replied while
the boodle was being transferred from the
mauresubia my gentle nigger boss was im-
proving his time by sticking close to raider
ana gloating on the boxes being lowered
through the hatch i seized the opportu-
nity and frisked podds room i found the
box under the mattress on his bunk
  wont podd make a row about it they
may suspect you
  you bet your sweet life podd will make
a row it is like stealing his life to deprive
a snow-user of his drug hell raise cain
 o
adventure
-but i am going to hide the box in that
ventilator-pipe and there isnt any danger
of them discovering it and im pretty
sure i can disarm any suspicion those sports
may have that im the guilty gink they
dont regard me as a man you know im
just a cockney flunkey i got to beat it
now i suppose that coon is already look-
ing for me
  after dooins stealthy and safe departure
i went to the ward-room and hung about
there for some time hoping for another
glimpse of the girl the room was deserted
dacy and his lieutenants spent most of their
time upon the bridge just coming below oc-
casionally to wolf the food that was ever
present upon the ward-room table but
none of them appeared during my wait
nor what was more important to me did
miss morrison appear again the door of
the captains cabin wherein dacy had
housed her remained closed
  finally i returned to my room i sought
my bunk and for a long time i lay there
thinking not thinking of dooin or podd or
of dacy or gold but thinking of the girl
  try as i would and i did try i could
not banish her from my thoughts in vain
i told myself that her spirited defense of
dacy proved her to be at least his friend
but myself would not admit the truth of
the impeachment i recalled dooins words
and a hot unreasonable resentment seethed
within me because of those words i told
myself that she was a stranger and my in-
nermost self proclaimed it false and de-
clared she was near and dear to me
  i contended impatiently with my own
conceit but her image persisted in my
minds eye her face bearing its telling marks
of suffering her eyes tear-misty or anger-
sparkling yon werners words recurred
to me she vas a lady und  like it nod
that she vas here
  nor did i like it she was a lady yes
but what was more to the point she was a
woman in trouble she was in a position
that might prove horribly dangerous it
sickened me to contemplate her possible
fate she would need me
  my blood coursed more swiftly and an
inexplicable joy thrilled me at the thought
she would need my help i registered a
mental vow that i would meet the need
  at last my watch informed me that it was
high time i was on my way below to re-
lieve the german i arose shifted my
clothes and stepped into the passageway on
my way to the engine-room
  as i passed the ward-room door dacys
voice hailed me i stopped and looked
within
  what i saw hurt for mary morrison
and dacy were seated side by side on the
divan in the farther corner of the room
his arms wrere about her and her face was
buried in his breast her shoulders were
heaving as if she were weeping
  it was not her weeping that hurt-it was
the fact that she was submitting willingly
to dacys embrace coming so close upon
the heels of my blissful knight - erratic
dreams the sight struck me with the force
of a blow
  come here a moment mcneil the
captain called
  as i advanced toward them mary mor-
rison raised her head and looked at me
her cheeks were tear-stained but she had
willed a cold immobility upon her features
her stony stare chilled
  mcneil have you seen a trinket laying
about anywhere-a miniature portrait uf
this young lady i had it in my hands
while i was talking with you last evening
just at the time that little cockney was dis-
covered in the storeroom and i seem to
have mislaid or lost it i have searched
everywhere without success i value it
very much
  silently i drew the bauble out of my
pocket and handed it to him
  why where did you get it was his
surprised demand
  you dropped it i said i picked it
up
  you picked it up then why did you
not return it before
  it did not occur to me to do so i re-
plied
  the girl seemed to be blinking back the
tears but her lips curled scornfully
  so it seems you are a sneak-thief she
remarked
  i flinched at the insult her words con-
veyed dacy regarded her with a surprised
air
  i have met this person before roger
she told him with a biting sarcasm in her
voice he did me a small service-a ser-
vice out of keeping with his present occu-
pation i dare say he is one of your very
good friends
you did not term the service small at
madame justice
the time i felt bound to retort and i
may tell you that your roger is no friend
of mine i am his prisoner here-as i
thought at first you were but now i see
you are not in need of my sympathy
dacy followed our exchange with a puz-
zled regard that changed to a quizzical
smile the girl received my words with a
face that slowly flushed as the purport of
my words sank in i turned and flung out
of the room
  i looked back as i passed through the
door dan had his arms about her again
and her face was lifted to his
to be concluded
madamb
justice-
nevil ghemhaw
author of the black violin  pair of mules cu
saw her as she was driving into
the little louisiana village of
landrv she was a tall rugged
old woman of the type-half
peasant half small planter-which abounds
in the french parishes and even at a dis-
tance there was that about her which made
one forget the squalidness of her battered
jumper and small rabbit-like pony when
she came closer and for an instant turned
her strong resolute face toward mine i saw
that tliis something was the dignity of a
great sorrow i shall never forget her
look it was like exchanging glances with
fate
  after she had passed i asked the village-
folk about her
   hat was madame gerac-she whom
we call madame justice they replied
it is only on this day that you will see her
here tomorrow is her anniversary and
she is upon her way to the cure with money
for a mass she is as tegular as the calen-
dar uiat one rain or shine it is always
the day before
  later and in the quaint patois of die
-ajun they told me this story
even in her youth madame gerac
was possessed of a strong sense of
justice she was a fine handsome
girl and she had many chances vet she did
not marry early her lovers were all nice
manly fellows she said and there was little
o choose between them in fairness she
could not make such a choice and she
would not marry only for a home
  later when louis gerac came along she
accepted him at once she could make her
choice now she declared and although it
was not considered a good match she made
it without hesitation
  gerac owned a small farm some twenty
miles from landry it was in a remote
desolate section and the buildings were
old the fields bounded upon three e-ids
by marsh and upon the fourth by a small
wood were always wet and boggy no
matter when you plowed them the soil
would stick to the plowshare like glue it
was the kind of a place upon which one is
fortunate to make both ends meet
  for four years madame gerac worked the
farm with her husband and in that time
two children came into her home of these
le

adventure
children the first was born to her it was a
son and it was given the fathers name of
louis gerac like most fathers was proud
of the child madame gerac worshiped it
in affection as in all else she was not one
to do things by halves
  the second child came into the gerac
family two years later it was an orphan
the son of a sister of geracs and at first its
adoption met with much opposition upon
the part of iiis wife perhaps realizing her
unfailing sense of justice she caught some
glimpse of what the future must hold for
her perhaps it was only the natural jeal-
ousy of a mother for her only child
  but gerac was firm he could not aban-
 don his nephew to charity he said also it
 was good that the little louis should have a
 playmate single children always became
 either dull or spoiled
  in the end madame gerac agreed and
the child was adopted its name was paul
and its age was the same as that of the son
of the house six months later having ex-
posed himself to the weather gerac took
ill and died
  her husband dead madame gerac fell
upon hard times it was difficult enough to
attend to the farm alone but in addition to
this she had the care and responsibility of
two small children most women would
have solved at least a part of the problem
by turning the adopted child over to charity
when it is a question of mouths to feed the
difference between two and three is very
great
  madame gerac however kept her small
 family intact she would arrange she said
 having accepted the care of the child no
 matter how unwillingly it was only just
 that she should go on with it
    it was now with the growing up of the
 children that the first great test of madame
 geracs justice began on the one hand was
 louis her beloved son the one bit of her
 own flesh and blood upon earth on the
 other was paul the outsider the unwel-
 come guest as it were of a lifetime would
 not madame gerac discriminate between
 the two would it not be quite natural
 even proper perhaps for her to do so al-
 ready she was spoken of as a woman of ex-
 ceptional fairness had she been only fair
 she might have made such a discrimination
  but madame gerac was something more
  than fair she was just and she did not
   discriminate
   always from the time of geracs death
to the very end it was the same in their
infancy the children received an equal
amount of food of clothing of everything
as they grew older and took thtir places if
the life of the farm their work was appor-
tioned to them with an absolute impar-
tiality did paul plow one day it was louis
who plowed the next did the son of the
house make holiday the outsider might
rest assured of an equal amount of time to
be spent in his own fashion and madame
gerac ever made sure that this time was so
spent to the last moment
   no she would say what is fair for
one is fair for the other we will have no
cinderella business upon this place
   thus the children grew up unlike in every
particular louis a slender handsome lad
developed a lightness an instability of
purpose which was totally at variance w-ith
the iron firmness of his mother he de-
tested ids work as much as he deplored its
necessity he shirked he complained he
lived only for the pleasure or amusement
that was to come with a parent less reso-
lute he would have been the most hopeless
of idlers
   paul was exactly the reverse strong and
ungainly with a huge knotted frame and
features that were redeemed from ugliness
only by their absolute honesty he became
from the first a model of industry and so-
briety no task was too hard for him no
difficulty too great to overcome he culti-
vated the farm as it had never been culti-
vated before through his efforts the little
family approached what would be for
them a species of prosperity and in ad-
dition to these other virtues paul was
possessed of a sense of fairness of justice
that was scarce inferior to that of his foster
mother		
   it was strange that louis the son should
be as wholly unlike his mother as paul the
outsider wras similar to her in every respect
the neighbors commented upon it some-
times they even jokingly inquired of madame
gerac if in their infancy she had not con-
fused the children
   are you quite sure that paul is not
louis they would ask if he is not he
should be
  but madame gerac could never appre-
ciate the humor of these remarks
   paul is a good boy she would repjv 
but louis is my son
madame justice

  such was her attitude unstable worth-
less selfish though he might be louis was
her son the recipient of her mother-love
  what she felt for paul none knew al-
though it was said that she could never for-
get the unwelcomeness of his arrival his
industry might have inspired in her a feeling
of satisfaction it could have been nothing
more ardent
at the close of the civil war
louis and paul stood upon the
threshold of manhood thus far
they had passed their days in quiet un-
eventfulness upon the farm the fighting
had been far away reports of it seldom
penetrated to such a remote district in
landry itself they could scarce have told
you whether the struggle had lasted one or a
dozen years
  with the beginning of reconstruction
however the people of this peaceful country
came to know at least of the dreadful after-
effects of war heretofore their affairs had
been conducted by officials carefully chosen
from among their own land now these
officials were thrust from office and their
places filled by a relentless horde of carpet-
baggers
   it was a time of disaster of injustice and
persecution what the carpet baggers did
not steal they destroyed they laughed at
justice they flouted mercy their cruelty
was that of the tyrant who has once been a
slave
  the inhabitants were patient but they
were also human when they could stand
no more they formed a comite dcs vigi-
lantes with which to purge the offices of
their parish in less than one week the
carpet baggers had been driven into the
cypress islands of the outlying sea-marsh
  biensaid the vigilantes and returned
to their farms but their work had only just
begun from fugitives the carpet baggers
developed quite frankly into outlaws under
the leadership of a brave resourceful man
who on account of his fierceness was called
le sauvage they emerged from their
cypress islands to harry the country far and
wide and as these islands flanked by a
barren and treacherous marsh were well-
nigh impregnable the vigilantes found it
very hard to retaliate
  now more than ever was it a time of
disaster the inhabitants immune from
the four years struggle found themselves
 suddenly plunged into a mimic war of their
 own backed by their redoubtable leader
 the outlaws fought like fiends each honest
 man was expected to take down his gun and
 join the ranks of the vigilantes
   madame gerac however was of a differ-
 ent opinion she insisted that louis and
 paul should stay upon the farm
   no she said when the young men
 came to her it is all right to be a hero
 but what about the plowing for the pres-
 ent mes enfants you must content your-
 selves with fighting the battle of life
   and despite the troubled times madame
 geracs action was not criticized she had
 struggled hard and it seemed only fair that
 her children should be left for her protection
 and support
   justice to madame justice said the
 neighbors as they had already begun to
 call her
    as for the young men they accepted this
 restraint according to their natures paul
 slow methodical and obliging resigned
 himself quite calmly to the wishes of his
 foster mother he would like to fight he
 said if only as a proof of his good inten-
 tions his duty though must come before
 liis desire
   louis showed more impatience he was
 young handsome and dashing it was his
 one desire in life to cut a figure each
 fight each tale of personal bravery but
 served to increase his discontentment his
 mother was mad-selfishly mad he said
 she could not expect to treat him like a
 child very well he would show her
    and show her he did upon the first oppor- 
 t unity
it occurred t the very
height of the struggle at a time
when accompanied by a band of
picked horsemen le sauvage was scounnng
the country as with fire he struck and
escaped with the swiftness of lightning
none knew where next his hand would fall
his scouts patrolled each road
 one afternoon as they were returning
 rom work louis and paul discovered one
 of these scouts the outlaw sat on his
 horse in the security of a small clump of
 brush and as was the custom in those
 days each of the young men was armed
 at sight of the scout louis drew hi foster
brother down into the cover of the tall
grass

adventure
  you saw he whispered excitedly it
 is what i lave been waiting for now we
 will show them whether we are men or not
 if we lie hat and crawl we can approach
 unseen within easy range
  but why shoot him objected the less
 excitable paul we are not vigilantes
 and he has as yet done us no harm trouble
 will come of it you may be sure
  but louis was not to be deterred from
 this opportunity of proving himself a man
  you are afraid paul he sneered
 very well then i will bear the responsi-
 bility alone and putting his words into
 effect he began to crawl away
  paul thought for a moment and then fol-
 lowed him
   bien said he if you are determined
 i will go with you it is only right that we
 should stand together in the matter
  they shot the outlaw from close range
 firing together the man instantly killed
 toppled from his horse without a sound
 the silence the simplicity of his death was
 in some way terrifying to the young men
 had the outlaw screamed had he strug-
 gled it is probable that they would have
 rushed forward to finish him as it was
 they fled panic-stricken to their home
   thus they failed to notice a second out-
 law who had been stationed a little way be-
 yond his companion this second outlaw
 saw the two in their flight but he did not
 pursue them instead he galloped off to
 report to his leader le sauvage had a
 fondness for attending to such matters in
 his own way
    that night the young men made no men-
 tion of their deed to madame gerac paul
 if troubled w-as calm louis sought unsuc-
 cessfully to hide a nervous fear after sup-
 per making some excuse both went out to
 confer with a distant neighbor when they
 returned madame gerac noticed that their
 clothes were stained with fresh earth after-
 ward it was discovered that following the
 neighbors advice they had put the dead
 outlaw under ground
   it was perhaps half an hour after the
  young men had departed for their work the
  following morning that a body of horsemen
  rode up to the door of the farmhouse at
  their head was the huge forbidding man
  whose name was a synonym for terror  et
  cruel and relentless though he was le
  sauvace-who had once been a gentleman-
  was justly renowned for his courtesy to
women dismounting now lie stepped up
to the door removing his hat as he knocked
upon it
  madame gerac opened to him at once
she had seen the outlaws from a distance
yet she made no attempt to escape in-
deed if she felt any fear it was most suc-
cessfully hidden the day was bright and
warm and already the blinds had been
drawn against the approaching glare ma-
dame gerac only shaded her eyes with one
hand as is the custom of farm women when
receiving a visitor
   le sauvage bow-ed low
  you are madame justice he inquired
  i am madame gerac she returned
if they speak of me as madame justice
that is no affair of mine
   and yet said le sauvage if i may do
so without offense i should prefer to call
you by the latter name it will be more ap-
propriate in view of what i have to say
  as you please msieu agreed madame
gerac and now for your business
  to begin with madame said le sal-
vage i have always admired the reports
of your justice to this admiration you
may attribute the security thus far of
your home and family indeed it is prob-
able that with all things equal you might
have continued immune from my wrath
yesterday however your sons broke our
tacit truce from ambush and for no ap-
parent reason they killed one of my men
this man sitting quietly upon his horse
was harming no earthly thing firing
together your sons shot him down like a
dog-
   now this madame places me in an un-
fortunate position had your sons been
vigilantes i might for your sake have
charged their deed to my general account
against that organization as it is i cannot
overlook the affair my men must be pro-
tected i cannot have them tired upon
unfairly by even farm lad who wishes to
distinguish himself
   so there is my case which i contend is
plainly one of deliberate and unwarranted
assassination i now have the honor of ask-
ing vou madame justice to pass upon it
  a long minute passed during which ma-
dame gerac stood as though frozen in her
doorwav not for one instant did she doubt
the truth of the outlaws accusation in
the first place le sauvage did not lie in
the second she had heard the shots the
madame justice

afternoon before she had noticed the nerv-
ousness of her son
   come madame urged le sauvage
i regret ray necessity but there is little
time
  before she could speak madame gerac
was forced to moisten her lips with the tip
of her tongue
  i have tried to lie to you msieu and
i find that i can not said she steadily
your case is indeed a strong one
  le sauvage waited for something else
and when it did not come he uttered a
growl of admiration
  dieu madame he cried you more
then fulfil the reports of you i so seldom
run across your kind that i am going to
mark the event by an unexpected act i
had come here fully determined to kill both
of your sons and destroy your home one
falsehood from you one plea for two guilty
men and i would have done so but you
have kept faith with your reputation and
i who also am accounted just will keep
faith with mine
  we have ridden through the night and
our horses are tired below us there is a
wood we will rest in that wood for one
hour from your two sons you will choose
one to stand before my rifles i will accept
a life for a life an execution for an assassina-
tion surely that is fair enough
  madame gerac could not reply she
could only bow her head
  again le sauvage bowed low
 adieu then madame justice said he
remember we will wait but the hour
and let me warn you against any tricks
our horses though weary are swift and the
v	igilantes are twenty miles away should
i be forccd to return it will be to carry out
my original intention
for a little while after the outlaws
had gone madame gerac continued
to stand in her doorway strangely
enough her first feeling was not so much
one of grief as of disappointment she
stared out at the dilapidated buildings the
low unprofitable fields the fewr poor head
of stock howshe had worked and planned
and contrived to keep it all together it
was what she had hoped to leave her son
she had toiled with this one end in view
and now perhaps- with the thought
temptation came knocking at her motlur-
neart
   her children knew nothing of the visit of
 le sauvage she had but to call them in
 to dispatch paul upon some pretended
 errand to the wood and the matter would
 be ended or again she might even con-
 clude the affair without deceit she could
 call paul alone she could tell him of the
 dreadful dilemma that he would go with-
 out question or complaint she knew well
 he was that kind
   but she was also her kind she was ma-
 dame justice
  slowly resolute madame gerac re-
crossed the threshold of her home before
her a short passage led back to the kitchen
half way down this passage she had put
temptation behind her she arrived at
her decision with her hand upon the kitchen
door
  once inside the kitchen madame gerac
acted quickly going straight to the shelf
above the open fire she took from it a pack
of cards it was an old pack soiled and
thumbed from the handling of many games
placing the pack upon the kitchen table
she took from its nail the battered tin horn
with wiiich she was wont to call in her chil-
dren she was forced to blow thrice before
she could produce a sound
  when the young men arrived madame
gerac wasted little time she called to
them when they were still some distance
from the kitchen doorway
  quick you two she began you
killed an outlaw from ambush yesterday
afternoon
   louis stopped instantly his face grew
 deathly white and his knees began to bend
 under him paul plodded doggedlv forward
 his eyes were troubled but when he spoke
 his voice was steady enough
   yes mother he replied as he had been
 taught to call her
   you shot together-at the same time
   yes mother
  the man was not harming vou-he
made no threatening movement
   no mother
  madame gerac frowned evidentlv
something was puzzling her
  but why she continued i can
understand such a thing from louis he
of course wished to prove himself a man
but you paul-you are not accustomed to
play the fool come wthy did you do it
   paul s mouth closed detcrminedlv louis
 crept forward his eyes appealing madame
m

adventure
gerac however knew her children only too
well
  i see said she louis insisted und
you thought it your duty to stand with him
in the matter nevertheless you were a
fool paul le sauvage has been here
also he has been just only one of you
will have to pay he has promised to wait
an hour in the wood for the one to come to
him after that it will be both also the
house he has told me to choose between
you but i can not you will have to deter-
mine the choice yourselves
  paul nodded quietly
  jbien said he then i shall go
mother it will be better for you that way
it will-
  madame gerac did not falter
  you will do nothing of the sort paul
she interrupted firmly the guilt is equal
between you the punishment must be
left to chance inside i have placed the
cards in readiness upon the table you will
each cut and the one who shows the lowest
card will go come there is no time to
lose
  she turned and re-entered the kitchen
with paul following close behind her
  louis followed more slowly dazed
stupefied by fear he had thus far been un-
able to utter the excuses the entreaties
that rose to his lips had it not been for
this stupefaction it is probable that he
would then have tried to make his escape
as it was his paralyzed limbs seemed to
carry him unwillingly forward slowly and
with wide staring eyes like one in a dream
he made his way into the kitchen and took
his place at the table beside paul
  madame gerac did not look at her son at
this moment there were some things that
even she could not stand
  you will cut first louis since it was
you who suggested the deed said she
afterward you will wait for paul you
will then turn up your cards together
dazedly mechanically louis reached
over and removed a part of the pack after
he had done so his hand fell heavily to his
side the fingers fumbling nervously at the
cards paul cut quickly but carefully stay-
ing his hand a little way above the pack as
if warned by some hidden sense madame
gerac faced about
  paul without a tremor turned up his
cut disclosing a ten of clubs louis with
shaking hand displayed a king of hearts
madame gerac expelled her breath in a
long sigh half of horror half of relief
  as was his custom paul had upon coming
inside removed his hat now replacing
liis cards he reached out for it with his
hand upon the brim he paused
  what is the use he asked himself
  but a moment later he picked up the hat
it was the triumph of habit
  madame gerac had never been a demon-
strative woman when paul came over to
her she only kissed him upon the forehead
  farewell paul said she you have
been a good son to me
  farewell mother replied paul and
turned to his foster brother
  louis stood motionless although he also
had replaced his cards paul hefd out hi
hand there seemed nothing that he could
say as the two clasped silently madame
gerac again turned away her head
  when madame gerac looked around a
moment later paul was gone louis still
stood in his same position although no
with his body bent he was reaching down
toward the floor at his mothers glance
he straightened up quickly furtively a
sudden rush of color surged into his face
and his eyes exchanged their terror for a
look of sullen shame
  there was no deceiving madame gerac
in the matter of her children she knew
their every mood not for one moment
had she sought to blind herself to the evi-
dent cowardice of her son now that he was
safe however it was hardly natural that
he should have the appearance of a whipped
dog
  slowly mercilessly madame gerac raked
her son with her gaze noting the flushed
cheeks the furtive eyes the sullen mouth
then as she looked below the level of his
waist her lips suddenly tightened that
right leg why was it held so rigidly that
right foot why was it planted with so much
firmness and whence came that dull
glint of white beneath the tight-pressed
heel
  with one swift movement madame
gerac was at her sons side with another
she had thrust him away then stooping
she picked up the card it was a deuce of
spades grimy and tom and marked now
with the crescent-like impression of a heel
  dieut gasped madame gerac and
groped blindly for a chair
  after she had sunk into it she regained
madame justice

control of herself her eyes flashed as she
held up the card
explain she cried in a dreadful voice
louis knew that tone it was one that
could not be denied trembling sobbing
he fell upon his knees at his mothers side
burying his face in her lap
  forgive me mother forgive me he
pleaded i could not go i wanted so to
live with paul it was different he
offered himself at the first he knew-
  explain cried madame gerac ex-
plain before it is too late
  it was after i had cut sobbed louis
i was holding the cards at my side i knew
the pack well i had noticed that the deuce
was torn when i felt the tear i dropped
the deuce to the floor and set my heel upon
it i had no idea of what the next card
would be i swear to you that i did not
know it was a king it was only a small ad-
vantage and i took it well knowing that
paul was willing to go
  for just one moment madame gerac
permitted her hand to rest upon the bowed
head of her son
  my poor louis she murmured half in
pity half in contempt
  then she rose quickly to her feet
come said she you may yet be in
time
  louis shrank back the color drained
from his face leaving it white again small
dots of perspiration appeared upon his brow
  mother mother he gasped you
can not mean it
  come repeated madame gerac this
time it was a command
  louis crouched behind the table he was
like a rat in a trap his lips curled threaten-
ingly and an ugly light came into his eyes
  i will not go i tell you he snarled
my life is my own you had best take
care even though you are my mother
madame gerac gave him not so much as
a glance instead she sprang to the comer
where upon coming inside the young men
had leaned their weapons an instant
later she had whirled about gun in hand
  quick louis she demanded shall
it be here or there you have lost have
you not then you will pay me or you
will pay le sauvage or if you are too late
you will pay paul

  she advanced upon him suddenly forcing
him toward the door
  dieui she burst out as she drove him
through it it is bad enough for you to be
a coward although i can stand that but
to be dishonest-no
  and she added as she hurried him for-
ward
  do not try what is in your mind i
shall not allow you to escape if you take
to your heels you will not get a dozen
yards
 it was a strange pair that went
 down toward the wood-the son
stumbling along before his eyes
wild his lips babbling forth an unheeded
stream of supplication the mother stalking
grimly behind her gun thrust forward as a
goad her face a mask of silent agony one
glance she gave along the path that sepa-
rated the farm from the wood only to lind
it empty although but little time had
elapsed since the cutting of the cards paul
had already disappeared beyond the line of
trees
  faster ordered madame gerac quick-
ening her pace louis looking back into
the muzzle of the gun broke into a long
shuffling stride
  when they were some fifty yards from
their goal a brisk sound of riile fire rattled
out from among the trees madame gerac
paused as abruptly as if it were she who
had been shot lowering her gun she
made the sign of the cross
  louis paused also but only for an instant
with the first crash of the volley he had
made up his mind before him lay certain
death behind it might not be so sure
after all she was his mother perhaps
for the first time she might not live up to
her word
  as louis bending low ran for his life
madame gerac raised her gun she was a
most excellent shot she did not hesitate
and so gaunt silent and tragic
madame gerac comes each year to
landry always it is upon the dar
before her anniversary and always she
brings money for a mass also the village-
folk inform me she is impartial to the end
always the mass is for the two

furrinerf
harold tittaj
author of an event
       t was no fight neither-
knowing baldy brown-was it
the sickening triumph of a bully
it was just a natural reaction
only the inevitable boiling-over of that spirit
which was once so typical but which is now
ebbing so rapidly from michigan lumber-
camps the popping of a safety-valve which
resulted in bruised faces and battered bod-
ies minor results compared to what might
have happened had there been no outlet
before the emotion gained that strength at
which it would burst all bonds
  he went from one end of the bunk-house
to the other roaring as a storm flinging his
thick arms with the vigor of drive-rods de-
molishing with a final swing the crude chair
that had put three of them flat kicking
clutching striking swearing and they
scurried from him those slavs not one
of them wanted to stand so those who were
bruised and beaten were only the ones who
tarried too long in his path
  such men could give no battle to baldy
brown with his six foot three and his two
hundred ten-all lithe pliable muscle on
sturdy bone-and his woods training a
blow sometimes two at the most three
sufficed they were whipped in a breath
and he roared his way onward daring them
to stand
  so i repeat it was no fight
  they were foreigners and the first of their
kind with whom baldy brown had ever been
forced to work up there on the south
shore european labor was making its initial
appearance in lumber-camps marking the
final passing of that swashbuckling clan
which lent romance to the devastation of
forests and baldy one of the last of his
kind could not bear it
  he had stood much in his time stood the
coming of a milder breed of bosses the go-
ing on of scores of companions the arrival
of a less stanch army of native stock but
when they put him to bunk and eat and
work with foreigners who would not do a
mans work and who could not make a mans
fight-well something had to break for
in the woods a mans capacity for manual
accomplishment and blow-for-blow con-
flict is the measure of his value to the race
and wo to him who shirks
  these men shirked and on them baldy
brown accepted over a hundred-mile radi-
us as a true woodsman had breathed his
damning judgment
  th furriners hed mutter under his
breath th low-down furriners fail-
ing in his classification to remember that he
had toiled and brawled side by side with
french and scotch in his hey-days they
aint a man among em furriners
  then the limit and unprovoked by word
or look he bellowed his warning and charged
through them vision red finding relief in
the way he knew from the tortured soul
of one man conies a great symphony from
another a master poem or picture when
baldy browns innermost being writhed
there could be no relief other then his knot-
ted fists meeting flesh
  knowing him then the affair could not
be characterized by the spirit of the bully

 furriners

  and when he had gone from the farthest
shadow clear down to the door at the other
end of the building brown turned and
looked back from their bunks the half-
dozen other old-timers laughed indulgently
at the astounded men of another race-strain
who cowered from the storm turned on
them
  furriners yelled baldy brown in a
voice choked with honest rage furrin-
ers aint they a man among yez wont
one o yez please stand up an hit me so i
can kill him
  he took a half-dozen steps toward them
again and those nearest him stirred as
if to retreat
  yeah he scoffed and stopped
furriners
  then he wheeled opened the door and
slammed it behind him going into the night
it was a haggard bruised baldy
brown who three weeks later awoke
sober in cheboygan he had
warped memories of a dozen fights in as
many towns of nights passed in different
camps where the presence of alien labor al-
ways drove him on to another trip by rail
or rutted road until he came to himself
broke shaken in the lower peninsula with
winter at its worst
  but winter at its worst really meant at its
best for logging was on and men like baldy
brown-known by the set of their jaws and
the swing of their shoulders to every camp-
boss in the great lakes country-are al-
ways in demand he hired out in a saloon
got a drink and a ticket and climbed into
the smoker of the dingy accommodation-
train which was to worn its way westward
through the drifts
  of the man who bought his services
brown asked but one question and asked it
seriously weightily confidentially and
the other sizing the big chap up laughed
and said hurriedly
  furriners aw th crews all white
that much settled baldy was content to
sleep and wait until the conductor ordered
him off
  it was noon and thawing a bit when he
stepped out into the snow and struck up the
road to which he was directed his heart
was light for behind he was leaving bad
memories he had little idea of what
flight await him in this camp on loon lake
ljut camps are all much alike and he rev-
eled in the memory of the assurance given
him that the crew was while such was
sufficient to warm his soul
  here comes a jack growled the cook
to the cookee as he saw brown swing into
camp just before dusk you can tell em
fars you can see he added a bit grimly
for he was an old cook and too cherished
memories of the men who were worthy of
the grub he set out
  baldy sniffed deeply the tainted air of
the bunks as he shoved open the door and
stepped into the room a bit of a senti-
mentalist was this big-chested son of the
timber lands and the odors were good to his
nostrils he was glad to be back he had
had his drunk work was before him and in
the facts he took the joy of the lumber-
jack also the crew was of white men
his breed it was like a home-coming
  and the disappointment was doubled
when the crew came in he heard and de-
tected a difference in their voices before the
door opened he knew they spoke a for-
eign tongue and for the instant before rage
came the men felt sick at heart
  but he held his peace and kept the dis-
gust to himself something of a fatalist
perhaps was in him anyhow he held his
gaze to his plate at supper went to his
bunk from the table and putting his face
close to the log wall muttered contemptu-
ously as sleep came
  furriners they aint-white
      baldy for reasons unknown to
himself tried to forget the situation
the boss put him top-loading and he
labored lustily throughout the day think-
ing of the near future when his muscles
would be right again and he could hit the old
killing pace it was good to be at work
handling tackle seeing things move in
spite of the fact that the old energy which
used to accomplish the big things in logging-
camps was not in evidence
  at night he was silent again and again
under blankets before the whole crew had
finished eating he was facing the inevi-
table he began to understand foreigners
had come to stay were penetrating even
corner of the woods it made him restless
with a species of homesickness and the
realization took from him for the moment
that lust to break and maim made him
gentler in a morose sort of way incentive
to fight comes only with having men to whip
i so
adventure
  baldy followed the bent of old cus-
toms established when bosses did not drive
men in lumber-camps but busied themselves
in search of tasks for the work-gluttons who
toiled in the crews the same condition
that had made him revolt up there in the
superior country prevailed here the crew
lagged had to be pushed from start to quit-
ting time not a man of them took pride
in his work not a stroke was made in heal-
thy competition their final object was to
remain on the pay-roll
  but browns example went for nothing
a handful of younger natives saw and ad-
mitted his prowess in a listless sort of way
that hurt him but not with the sting en-
gendered by the utter indifference of the
poles who made up the bulk of the crew
  worse than the failure to inspire effort in
those about him was the fact that their
slovenly progress made it impossible for
the big fellow to maintain his regular pace
teamsters were slow others bungled he
could work like the furies for thirty min-
utes perhaps then wait for something to
do it was exasperating indeed
  they wont light they wont work
they aint men he muttered over and
over
  hed have laughed then had any one
told him that perhaps down in those men
was the spark waiting to be touched and
bring out their vigor that would have
been beyond his comprehension he could
see things only in his way-which is a fault
of many big men
  one little pole a teamster was a particu-
lar irritant to baldy brown he was small
he was quiet he was timid and slow and
could not stand the cold
  yez cant even raise hair on yer face
brown cried the first time his temper rose
above control and flung a scornful gesture
at the diminutive teamster whose thin
blood mustache held two tiny icicles
  and so malevolent was his glaring that
the slav winced as from a blow and looked
over his shoulder with concern as he drove
away
  from then on baldys outbursts were
frequent and with each tirade the evident
fear of the poles mounted the situation
became almost like that of a wolf threaten-
ing sheep-the way they drew together and
listened mutely while he swore and threat-
ened
  yez aint men he would chant  they
aint a days work or a fight in yez yez
aint men
  the little teamster with the puny mus-
tache was a particular mark for brown s
abuse  hey laced one another at table
and the big top-loader glared such hate that
the other was frigthened out of eating they
met in the bunk-house and baldy raised
both hands slowly as if to crush the
pole with his bodily weight but stopped
the movement with a taunting laugh as the
little chap slunk away
  yes it was bullying then not the bully-
ing of one man not the singling out of him
because he was small but because he
typified to brown all that was disgusting
about his kind and because the spleen which
grew in the lumber-jack there among the
men from across salt water must find a vent
  furriners yez he shouted from his
bunk one night and shut a sudden silence
on the room no grit an no work in yez
yez cant learn nothin-cant learn to
work furriners
  then he flopped back into the shadows
and tossed through a short night
      they awoke to a forty-below
morning with the buildings and
trees and very dry air snapping and
booming in complaint while the long ripping
screeches of the frozen lake gave stronger
effect to the symphony of extreme tempera-
ture but baldy browns temper was not
chilled  it glared at white- heat and as he
hung low over his plate at breakfast a ma-
licious gaze roved up and down the row of
faces before him while his fingers clenched 
with a vicious grip the handle of his knife
  just the sounds of feeding not a spoken
word as is the rule at camp meals so it
was more than astonishing when he sprang
to his feet rested both hands on the edge
of the table leaned far forward and measur-
ing the words to let them sink in bellowed
yez cant work yez cant fight yez
cant learn aint they a furriner among
yez wholl fight me-wit five more to help
him he shook his fist at the little team-
ster aint they twenty ill bust yer
heads for yez ill do that an i  thank
yez fer tryin to kill me
naw-they aint furriners enough in th
world to jump a white man yez don t
know how-an yez cant learn-fwthin
and of course after that outburst there
was only one thing to do with his check j
furriners

in his pocket baldy sat by the bunk-house
stove and waited for daylight muttering to
himself and moving his big feet restlessly
  its hard he told the cook as he but-
toned his mackinaw and started for the
door a man cant find a camp where he
can do a days work i dont want to quit
but what you goin to do huh furrin-
ers
  a man cant find a camp where its fit to
live he flung over his shoulder as he set out
into the tingling morning off through the
strip of timber to the edge of the lake where
the road crossed a mile-wide arm on fifteen
inches of ice
  baldys heart was heavy as he went
along swinging his arms now and then to
keep the blood going he did not mind
forty below that was a part of his life
but for the first time in his experience he
was knowing sorrow not because he was
out of a job and headed nowhere for that
too was part of his life but because for all
he knew there was not a camp between
him and superior where he could find a crew
of natives and if he could not find a
camp where was he to go he felt evicted
  the sensations he experienced kept his
eyes on the snow before him so he did not
see the gray team approaching across the
level lake surface when he stepped out of the
timber he was wondering what he would
do when he had covered the dozen miles to
the railroad station and after arriving
at the conclusion that he had not a plan to
his name his gaze went up out across the
white lake canopied by the fog of frost
particles through which the sunlight strug-
gled he saw the grays then and saw
the driver walking beside them to keep
from freezing his step faltered and the
fingers within the thick mitten clenched
for it was the one gray team of the camp
and the teamster was the little pole
  th furriner he said aloud and quick-
ened his pace-just to take one good part-
ing paste at the little man
  it was much too cold for riding so the
pole had dropped from his load and trudged
beside the sleigh the grays strained
against the friction that frost makes when
two thousand feet of hardwood bear down
n the runners and their progress was slow
still in his heavy clothing it was an effort
lor the walker to keep up
  the team gave him no concern they
would obey at a word but after every
few steps his eyes sought a rope which was
flung over the top of the load and ran down
to the pole that was the trip-rope to his
gooseneck a gooseneck is a contrivance
to which the eveners are attached a jerk
from the rope will release it and set the
horses free it is an essential where heavy
hauls are made across ice for even the best
ice will fail at times logs settle deep into
the water and unless the horses are freed
they will be dragged to a drowning with a
rapidity that is horrible
the pole had felt uncomfortable
about that trip-rope ever since the
grays settled to the pull across the
lake perhaps it was premonition but
even had the hemp been in his hands it
might have availed no tiling because the
load went through without so much as a
crackle of warning his footing tilted sharp-
ly and he was flung heavily to his side then
doused as water sloshed over the broken
ice cakes
  the horses grunted and scrambled for
footing but all the power they could bring
to bear was as a whiff of nothing against the
tug from behind and they went backward
and down snorting with fear
  from afar baldv brown saw the load
settle and knew what it meant his ma-
licious motive was forgotten with the same
abruptness that his feet took up the mo-
tions of running for horses were through
the ice and it needed a man to get them out
as he ran he felt the hot scorn for foreigners
well up a man should be with that team
   buf his scornful expletives ceased and he
muttered astonishment at what he saw
he could not hear the poles cry of fright
as the ice gave and put him off his balance
but he did see the little fellow roll over
drag a leg from the grip two blocks of ice
had clamped on it stumble to his feet and
pitch forward again as the settling load
careened and set his footing heaving that
time he went into water water that
smoked when the shriveling air met it
and baldy brown felt a shiver shoot
through him as he ran thinking not of the
teamster but of how water would feel on
human flesh-at forty below
   again the little pole found footing and
clothing already beginning to stiffen sought
his balance the team was down strug-
gling vainly to keep noses above the broken
ice which floated ready to congeal about
adventure
them to trip that gooseneck such was
the only way out
  and lo as he poised to spring for the
submerged load and grasp the rope which
still dangled over the topmost log he saw
the line snatched from sight and jerked
below the surface as a threshing horses
leg tangled with it below his team was
fast and the trip-rope gone his hands were
already freezing in their soaked gloves
  he cried out in his native tongue and
looked wildly about a man was running
toward him but the man was two hundred
yards away in heavy clothing and making
it over snow dry as salt where feet could
get no fair hold the horses would perish
before that help came
  the man shook his numbed hands free
from the stiff gloves and tore open his jacket
then stooped over on his insecure footing
he hesitated an instant before jumping
  breath whistled from liim as his body
plunged into that water but he did not
falter with one senseless hand stuck
stiffly into the crevice between two logs
he thrust the other deep down and groped
for that rope he worked his legs about in
the hope they might catch a loop of the line
he twisted and turned fighting off the kill-
ing chill as the seconds sped sobbing to him-
self his head went under water and ice
formed in his hair when it came above the
face he cried aloud-and the arm that
had tried to keep him safe lost its hold he
sank down close to the churning heels of
the grays then came up battling in the
crook of an elbow he clutched the trip-rope
  hold on yez he heard a man cry and
saw a figure flounder over the ice to the
load hold yer rope - an ill get yez
all
   fingers fastened in the neck of his sweat-
er and his body was jerked to the submerged
logs with a vigor of lift that was almost sup-
erhuman then the exquisite torture of
frost began
  big baldy brown got the little chap to
solid ice somehow-he never quite remem-
bered-and dropped him there then he
yanked lustily at the rope for which the
slav had gone into that ice water
   the horses renewed their threshing as the
tugs went black and chunks of ice slid from
their hind quarters as they came close to the
surface
  choke heem choke heem a thin voice
begged in his ear as baldy reached for the
grays heads from firm footing and he
roared back-
   choke th off one if yez can im gettin
this one
  he tore a line free breaking the stout
leather with what seemed like a half motion
looped the strap about the animals throat
and shut down on his windpipe he held
the throttling bond there with one hand and
turned on his side to help with the other
heedless even of the strain the frenzied horse
put against him
  the pole moved stiffly as if his
parts were of lead he dragged himself
close to baldy and reached out frightened
hands for the head of the free horse
  look out yez - youll fall in agin
the woodsman growled
  then together the one arm of brown
working with the two all-but-useless ones
of the little pole-they brought another
rein to bear about that other animals
throat baldy put the power of his body
on the straps
  they did not know the physics of tl
operation but they knew that to cut oil
the breathing of the animals would set
their bodies floating high and that they
could be easily pulled to solid ice slowly
the animals choked down and their bodies
rose to the surface
  when the other team came up with horses
on a run and driver swearing his encourage-
ment from afar baldy was speechless from
the cold and the pole lay motionless en-
cased in ice and by the time the second
horse had been pulled from the hole he had
helped make to lie breathing in sobs after
the choking that had saved his life baldy
could utter words only at the cost of an im-
mense effort he finally said-
  get this-furriner to-camp-quick
they took them both on the same sleigh
ministering as they made the short trip
the cook who was wise in the ways of
frost turned baldy over to others hurriedly
when he lookedat the pole he told the
camp-boss to telephone for a doctor
  and the cook was looking on late that
afternoon when baldy got out of his bun 
and made his way to where the little team-
ster moaned  
s all riht tack he heard the big j
chap say s all right nine men out o
six uld a quit them horses but you
didnt an youll get well an you n me
show these-- furriners what men is
         lnney star operative of the
secret service possessed the
camera eye in a measure
that is to say he never forgot a
face but unless the face was indissolubly
connected with some business or social
event the operative was apt to forget the
name of the owner of the face and the time
and place where he had first seen it he
was not at all superhuman or uncanny this
man tenney nor inquisitive save in mat-
ters of routine ordinarily a drunken man
was of slightest interest to tenney
  but the man who was buying champagne
for several other men in a far corner of the
dining-room wrhere tenney breakfasted
piqued the operatives curiosity for the
face was familiar-he had seen the man
before but where to the waiter serving
his coffee tenney indicated the purchaser of
the bubbling juice of the grape
  who s his merriness he asked ive
always thought that this was a quiet family
hotel thats why i came here i didnt
know you held wine parties at  a m
lawd mist tenney we usually dont
grinned the darkey but this yerc gent he
an t makin no noise and hes spendin his
money and- the darkey shrugged his
shoulders- i dunno who he is mist
i enney but t know what he is-hes a
tool with money and them gents with him
suyf make a hard try to part the two
who are they demanded tenney
  dont you know em seh but sho-
i s
figure
cant
lie
ay
arfhur
jom err
eoche
author of for bravery the
sport of kings etc
course you dont a patent lawyer like
you-au wouldnt know nothin about racin
people that big man at the end of their
table is mist diamond davebleakie he
makes book at bennings seh so do the
gents at his left and right mist bill heenan
and mist skyhigh  aids them other
two look like touts to me seh
    i guess the thirsty gentleman will play
 the races this aftnoon seh hes sure
 primed for a big day he was in here las
 night with the same crowd and i never see
 sech a hollow gentleman in my life he
 done opened two eases of wine and when
 they took him upstairs to bed he was
 weepih fo mo  and now he s been down
 here since eight oclock you gotta give
 him your admiration seh when it comes
 to dnnkin that gemman is sure educated
 he registered here vestday seh i can git
 his name from the office
    tenney smiled
    no thank you sam im not interested
   then he attacked his breakfast as if
he had forgotten all about the wine-bibber
in the corner yet on his wav out of the
hotel he stopped at the desk and glanced
carelessly at the register among the
arrivals of the previous night he saw in
sprawling chirographv the name of peter
r irkins of washington tenney pointed
at the name
our champagne friend he asked the
clerk
 the latter nodded

adventure
  dont know how he happened to pick
a quiet place like this for his party sir
apologized the clerk but hes been quiet
enough for all his drinking and his friends
however-if you object sir i ii speak to
the proprietor
   certainly not said tenney judging
from his friends hell be relieved of his
money soon and the hotel of his company
then brows wrinkled tenney left the
hotel for while he did not pride himself
particularly on his memory he nevertheless
knew that when he recognized a face he
should also recognize the owners name if
he saw or heard it he was certain that
he knew the face of the wine-bibber yet
in all his wide acquaintance he had never
met a man named peter firkins it was
strange tenney might see a man and not
know his name yet if the name were men-
tioned tenney would always know where
to place it likewise if a name were men-
tioned and a little later tenney should see
its owner even the lapse of many years
would not cause him hesitation in applying
the name to the man
   i must be getting old he told himself
failing memory is the first sign im told
well-
   he shrugged his shoulders and hailed a
cab in the presence of the important
message from dilkes chief of the secret
service which had come to him just before
breakfast tenney could ill afford to fret
his brain over trivialities he had dis-
missed the petty matter from his mind
when he entered the office of his chief
well chief he said you sent word
that--had broken loose so as soon as i
finished breakfast i-
   he paused his eyes suddenly alighting
upon a third figure in the room a small
man whose lack of stature was emphasized
by the manner in which he huddled-thats
the word-in a huge leather-cushioned arm-
chair the face and figure tenney recog-
nized at once and he raised his eyebrows
inquiringly as he looked at dilkes he be-
came suddenly conscious that the room
radiated nervous strain the man in the
chair lifted burning eyes and looked at
tenney
   this the man chief dilkes
   this is he replied the chief ten-
ney this is the secretary of war hes
come to me and ive sent for you be-
cause--
  the secretary interrupted
  why did you not come at once sir
is breakfast more important than-than
patriotism
  tenney flushed
  its rather essential sir that i come
prepared im not a health faddist i
need breakfast before i do anything and
i rather judged from the chiefs message
that id have to do some thinking
  thinking cried dilkes acting
tenney acting at once before the last
secret of the war department is given
away before the-
  before the united states is laid bare to
attack which it can not resist cried the
secretary before treachery black trea-
son has sold away the secrets of our national
defenses i dare not even think tor even
my thoughts are read written down and
sent to the agents of japan
  the secretary placed his hands before
his eyes and a shudder ran the length of
his body
  no one could hear-no one could see-
there was no signaling-no-
  tenneys muscles stiffened the lines
about the mouth hardened and the nos-
trils of the strong pugnacious nose see med
slightly to flare
  look here mr secretary he said
you mustnt give way worry gets you
nothing tell me-whats up
  the plans of the coast defenses of the
united states are being sold to japan
said the secretary
  tenney whistled
  and the seller is-
  god alone knows ejaculated the
secretary
  oh no said tenney the seller
knows the buyer knows and-maybe well
know by and by try and tell me jut
what has happened will you please 
there was an easy friendliness in ten-
neys manner an absence of flunkyism in
the presence of the cabinet official that
spoke of conscious equality with any one and
every one it spoke of more than that
it spoke of the sane viewpoint that refuses
to recognize the supernatural in the purely
physical it spoke of confidence unmeas-
ured which is different from conceit
  dilkes used to say that tenney hyp-
notized people tenney denied the charge
i make em come down to earth that s
all he used to say
figures cant lie
  and in the present instance the secretary
came down to earth the bulk of tenney
the easy voice and colloquial speech were
as a cool spring in which the cabinet officer
bathed a burning brain his eyes seemed
to cool and liis upper lip ceased twitching
y youll excuse my losing control
of myself he said slightly apolo-
getic when i tell you whats
happened and the-the impossibility of its
happening last night in the washington
post-office a mail-sorter was going over
the mail in some way he tore an envelope
open he told me that while unusual
such accidents happen once in a while
well the contents of the envelope fell out
upon the floor the sorter picked them up
to replace them in the envelope but his
eye happened to be struck by a typewrit-
ten line across the top of the first page
of the contents and he saw the words
copy of plans for southwestern mobiliza-
tion
  mr tenney god was land to the united
states in seeing that a man of intelligence
was sorting that particular bunch of mail
this mail-sorter is an ambitious man three
months ago he took the civil service exami-
nations for a clerkship in my department
he passed and had already received noti-
fication that he would enter upon a clerk-
ship next week
  the average mail-sorter would have
replaced the plans in the envelope written
on the latter opened by mistake and
japan would have received the plans as
undoubtedly she has been receiving others
during the past few weeks
  but tliis mail-sorter had sense he
looked at the address he saw that the
plans were addressed to one itchi marcy
a fruit merchant in this city he won-
dered that a japanese should be receiving
copies of our military plans he wondered
and-late last night he brought the plans
to me
  mr tenney i was dumbfounded in
consternation listen the copies which
the sorter brought to me were exact every
detail of our planned mobilization of the
troops in the southwest in the event of
troubles with mexico were outlined there
vet mr tenney the originals of those plans
were not completed until five oclock yes-
terday afternoon
  i myself worked over the first draft
and when the final draft was completed i
made changes in my own handwriting in
it i made those last changes at five
oclock i happen to know for i heard a
clock striking at that moment now then
in the room with me at the time-my pri-
vate office in the war department-were
just two men the first assistant secretary
of war and my stenographer
  from two oclock when we commenced
work on the plans until six when i locked
the plans in my safe and left the office no
one entered the office no one left it no one
even knocked upon the door we three
were absolutely alone
  after the plans were completed at five
oclock i attended lo other business and
it was six by my own watch when the
three of us finally left the office yet mr
tenney those plans were mailed to itcki
marcy shortly after five oclock
  whats that cricd tenney
  the secretary smiled wanly
  i thought as you thought-impossible
he said wearily but look at this en-
velope
  he passed tenney the envelope addressed
to the japanese fruit merchant the opera-
tive looked at the cancellation mark across
the stamps clearly he saw the time
printed thereon  p m of the previous
day the secretary sighed
  it was midnight he resumed when
the mail-sorter brought me tliis envelope
my first thought was to have my stenog-
rapher arrested i would have done so
but ihat t noticed the time of the cancel-
ation then i was glad that i had not
shamed an innocent man for mr ten-
ney letters are not canceled until some
time after they are dropped into letter-
boxes-until they reach the post-office
even if the letter was brought directly to the
post-office it reached there half an hour
before i-and the two others-left the
office so it was impossible that my sten-
ographer-the first assistant is bevond
suspicion -could have mailed the en-
velope
  mr tenney remember that those plans
were exact copies of the ones in my safe
remember that no one left entered or
even knocked at the door between two and
six the windows of my office communi-
cate with no other building signaling was
out of the question nor was a dictagraph
employed to steal my dictation
adventure
  in my desperation i went to the de-
partment last night at shortly after mid-
night-i examined the walls-no wires
mr tenney it is physically impossible
that those plans left my office before six
or afterwards-for they are still in my safe
  and yet some time between five and
five-thirty a copy of plans-exact in every
detail-was mailed to a japanese who is
undoubtedly an agent of his native land
mr tenney some one read my thoughts
and-how long has it been continuing
during the past weeks ive drawn up plans
for mobilization of troops on the atlantic
coast-on the pacific ive even drawn
up plans of our coast fortifications
  and if this relatively unimportant
matter of mobilizing troops in the event of
trouble with mexico is conveyed to japan
how am i to know that other matters-
hawaii san francisco the philippines-
are not in her hands i dare not think i
dare not plan-im not a fool mr tenney
and yet no one left my office no one en-
tered-
  whats your stenographers name
demanded tenney bruskly
  james colwell
  his salary
  thirty dollars a week but mr ten-
ney why bother about him
  did he make carbon copies of the
plans
  yes-two but i have those in the
safe and-
  where did he come from
   hes a civil service employee mr ten-
ney i chose him because of his rapidity
and general usefulness but why bother
about him havent i made it clear that
he could not have mailed the plans
  youve made it clear that some one
mailed them snapped tenney and
you dont really believe in your heart of
hearts that any one has been reading your
thoughts do you
   the secretary smiled sheepishly
  n-no but-figures cant lie mr ten-
ney it was six when we left the office
it was before half-past five when the plans
were mailed and figures cant lie mr
tenney figures cant lie
  true enough said tenney but men
can cant they
   the secretary stared at him
  what do you mean
  im not sure that i know myself what
 i mean said tenney but-youve told
 me everything and dilkes is the only
 man youve told besides me
 the secretary nodded
 good said tenney now then-
 you keep quiet about this matter theres
 nothing gained by announcing it
 are you going to arrest the jap-
 marcy asked dilkes
 whats the use now asked tenney
 hed not give up anything and it would
 only warn whoever is selling the secrets
 but what are you going to do cried
 the harassed secretary
 tenney grinned
 me im going to put these plans in a
 fresh envelope and address them to itchi
 marcy
 the secretary gasped
 give him the plans that weve saved
 and if we dont said tenney smooth-
 ly isnt their failure to arrive going to
 alarm him-and the man who supplies him
 and whom do we want
 wh-why-the man who sells the plans
 stammered the secretary
 right said tenney
 he started for the door the secretary
 half rose
 you think you-can discover him
 tenney laughed
 i know where he is right now
 the secretary stared
 then arrest him arrest him lets
 get a file of marines and-
 but tenney shook his head
 i said i know where he is that isnt
 saying i can prove anything youll hear
 from me within twenty-four hours
 he nodded bruskly and was gone the
 secretary stared at the chief of the secret
 service
 are you sure the man is capable he
 asked remember how important the
 matter is and he treats it carelessly he
 says he knows he-figures cant lie dilkes
 figures cant lie
 but tenney said that men can replied
 the chief
 and what did he mean
 dilkes stared at the secretary
 lord mr secretary  never know what
 he means but he said it and i ve noticed
 he never says anything without a reason
 but the desperate cabinet officcr could
 only pass his hand across his brow as if
 to wipe away the agony for which the
figures cant lie

  departure of tenney and his confident
  manner had made room
but tenney did not mail the
plans to itchi marcy tenney
was not above changing his mind
in a corner of a quiet cafe to which he re-
paired after leaving the chiefs office
tenney thought
  tenney was neither a faker nor a bluffer
his confidence when he left the secretary
had not been assumed he had his own
reasons for confidence
    its half the battle he used to say if
im dead sure that im going to get
what i m after i dont have time to
think about the possibility of losing out
and if i don t think about losing well-i
dont lose
  but now as he mused over a bottle of
lithia water some of tenneys past success-
born confidence oozed away from him
the hopeful scientist on the seeming verge
of a great discovery is brought precog-
nition of failure by the contemplation of
the hgures of his last test-for he knows
the figures do not lie matter-of-fact al-
most phlegmatic was tenney that dis-
embodied spirits had copied the plans
tenney did not believe and yet-figures
could not lie as the secretary had hope-
lessly declared
  didnt the japanese boast of a culture
an education a religion that went back to
those ages before christianity dawned
didnt intelligent men claim that the an-
cient civilizations of asia were close to the
scheme of the universe and the powers that
planned the scheme for one fraction of
a second tenney felt his flesh crawl
   then he drained his glass rose to his feet
and took his heavy way out of the cafe
i his was the twentieth century for every
physical ellect there was a physical reason
such was tenneys philosophy and by it he
would abide what he had told the sec-
retary was true he knew where the man was
who had sold the secrets he must know or
else black magic existed in these sane days
but who the man was was different from
where he was the where was easy the
who-tenneys lips hardened as he struck
away from the cafe
  he examined the typewritten address
on the envelope addressed to the japanese
jruiterer of course each typewriter had
us own distinct identity bui to i race the
 identity-it wasnt even worth while to
 examine the machines in the war depart-
 ment ihe man clever enough to effect
 this treason was not fool enough to use a
 machine that might be traced he had
 probably gone to any one of a hundred
 places where he might use a machine for a
 few minutes it would mean weeks of
 laborious search to trace the machine
 tenney shook his head he wouldnt do it
 whoever the traitor was he was nothing
 short of a genius in his cunning genius
 -that was it
   yet genius said tennev to himself
 is merely the art of taking pains this
 fellow took infinite pains to prove that an
 apparent impossibility had been effected
 y hy so that in the event of discovery
 he would never be suspected
   he stopped short in his walk and
 scratched his head suddenly he laushed
 to himself
    if i try thinking this out he told him-
 self ill go as bug as the secretary is get-
 ting nix ill do something
    he strode toward the post-office care-
 lessly he had neglected to take the name of
 the mail-sorter he would not go back
 and ask the secretary for it for the post-
 office was close at hand he could find the
 name there and so he did liis gold badge
 ga e him access to the list of employees and
 their hours of duty it was not tenneys
 method to ask directly for information
 when indirection accomplished the same
 thing direction crystallized suspicion there
 was no reason why the postal people
 should know of his wish to see the sorter
 so why let them know why rive them
 opportunity to talk
    tenney took the list and ran over it he
 found the name of michael clarke sorter
 hours from  r m to midnight he
 must be the man who had notified the
 secretary of the treason tennev started
 to fold up the list his eye runiing idlv
 down the columns of names as he did so
 as though printed in letters of llame he
saw the name henry davis the camera
eye begets the photographic brain he
knew the name and the face that the name
belonged to stood before his mental eves
 et lenuey did not start gave no sign of
emotion he merely folded the paper
neatly and handed it to the chief clerk who
thanksrcured  fr  with a
l
adventure
  hope theres no scandal in our depart-
 ment said the clerk anxiously
   if there were id be liable to tell you
 wouldnt i grinned tenney
   and then he left the building his entire
 plan of action changed he had intended
 to visit the sorter in order to go over care-
 fully the latters tale of the discovery he
 had intended to mail the plans to marcy
 that suspicion might not be aroused bet-
 ter to let the japs get one more secret than
 so to alarm the plotters that they might
 further conceal their identities and methods
but now-
  its a hunch said tenney its a
hunch but sos most of this game
  for tenney was frank even with him-
self he knew that common sense appli-
cation and luck were the chief elements of
the criminologists success the first two
he had always the third he seized upon
whensoever he might
 the landlady of the modest board-
 ing house was most loquacious
  far be it from a widow woman
with her living to make to gossip about her
guests mr davis she said but honest
im glad youre here your brother is
always reglar with his rent money mr
davis and i dunnos i have any call to say
anything at all about him but me taking a
sort of interest in all my guests and you
being his own brother seems like my con-
science compels me to tell you that your
brother is carrying on awful mr davis
  boys will be boys mrs paxton grin-
 ned the pseudo davis
  i know that mr davis and your
brother is a nicc-mannered boy too but
he aint been to home at all last night and
last week he was out three whole nights and
the week before that four times and-i
dont want you should repeat all this but
when your brother came here a year ago he
was as nice a young man as id want to
meet
  but lately-hes got in bad company
mr davis  knew it for in his room ive
found racin papers and pieces of cardboard
that i know are bettin tickets my poor
dead husband had that bad habit-playin
the races mr davis and i know the bettin
tickets when i see em it led my husband
to drink and then-im a widow woman
now mr davis and i feel its my christian
duty to tell you about your young brother
sos you can snatch him from the burnin
mr davis and if youre offended and
get him to move-well ive done ray duty
mr davis
  im not offended was her visitors
answer i appreciate your kindness i
shall certainly lecture my brother
  you certainly ought to sir said the
landlady him bettin two hundred at
a clip-i dunno how he does it on his salary
hes headed for ruin sir if youll excuse a
christian woman for sayin what its her
bounden duty to say
  thank you mrs paxton was the
grave answer ill see henry today
good afternoon im only sorry- that he
wasnt at home but you tell him of my
call if he comes home before i get back
have him stay in
   i will sir promised the landlady
  whereupon tenney making mental note
to send the landlady a twenty-dollar bill
for the information which she had given to
the alleged brother of the young mail clerk
henry davis departed from the house of
the valuable and good-hearted mrs paxton
around the corner he found a drug store
wherein was a washington directory he
turned to the cs shortly he was in pos-
session of the information that james col-
well clerk in the war department lived
at an address near dupont circle ten-
neys eyebrows were raised he smiled and
bent his steps in the direction oi the sten- g-
raphers address it was a private hotel
one of the best colwells entire weekly
salary would hardly pay the stenographers
rent much less clothe and feed him
  its a wonder said tenney to himself
that the main guys dont look after their
employees more trust a man with im-
portant priceless secrets and never in-
vestigate to see whats his manner of liv-
ing
  he grunted disgust at the fatuousness
that trusted without investigation and left
the neighborhood half an hour lat r he
entered the fruit store of itchi marcy
there happened to be no customers in the
store at the moment and a white clerk as
engaged in piling fruit in attractive
mids tenney walked past him and ad-
dressed himself to a bright-eyed japanese
who sat at a desk from an inner pocket
the secret service man pulled the bundle ot
plans in a plain envelope he laid them
on marcys desk
figures cant lie

  i suppose you were alarmed because
they hadnt come eh
  the jap looked up suspiciously he
opened the envelope and glanced at the
contents
  why were they sent this way he asked
 getting a little leery of the mail was
 tenneys answer it looked safer this
 way
  who are you demanded marcy
  oh im just a friend smiled tenney
 im getting mine which reminds me
 he-you know who i mean-says he needs
 a bunch of coin today anything doing
 the jap looked again at the envelopes
 contents if he had any suspicion it vanished
 at a closer examination of the papers he
 unlocked his safe placing the papers there-
 in and at the same time extracting from a
 drawer some bills of a denomination quite
 large to be in the possession of a retail
 fruiterer he handed the money to tenney
 the latter shook his head he achieved a
 sullenly sheepish look
  put it in an envelope he said and
 seal it he-he dont trust me a whole
lot-him and hell swear i copped some
 for myself if it aint in an envelope
  again the jap looked curiously at tenney
 but he made no demur he placed the
 bills in an envelope sealed it and handed
 it to tenney the latter shook his head
  address it he demanded
  the japs eyes gleamed his hand shot
forth and pulled open tenneys coat the
useful little gold badge with the insignia
of the secret service was revealed marcys
other hand shot to a drawer in his desk but
tenney had recovered from ins first sur-
prise his fingers closed around the wrist of
marcy there was a wrench a straining
heave and the jap was hurled from his
chair and lay twitching upon the floor
before the white clerk had gathered his
startled wits tenney was at the door
whistling peculiarly a blue uniform came
around the corner and its wearer saw the
upraised finger of tenney and came down
the street on the run the operative
turned to the alarmed clerk
    nothins goin to happen lo you son
  this isnt a hold-up your boss is going on
  a little visit with this gentleman and
  he indicated the policeman to the latter
  he showed his badge lock that jap up
  he said tell the captain that no one is
  to see him not if its the jap ambassador
tell him its the secret service got me
the policeman dazed but understanding
nodded he bent over the form of marcy
   a little water thats all said tenney
he was going to use a gun on me but i
beat him at his own game i knew a little
jiu-jitsu ring up the patrol lock up this
store and put him in a cell ill be around
tonight to make a charge and mind you
no lawyers-nobody-to see him
   again the officer nodded assent tenney
walked to the safe and calmly abstracted
the plans which had just been sold to the
japanese then he left the fruit store a
smile of chagrin wreathing his lips
   i fell down there he said but that
doesnt prove that im not right marcy
was too clever but-i dont believe the
other fellow is
  he hailed a passing taxi and directed
that he be driven to the bennings race-
track half an hour later in the betting-
ring he found the man for whom he was
looking mr peter firkins the wine-bibber
of the morning firkins was under the
influence of liquor but not completely so
by any manner of means as the negro
waiter had said firkins must have been
hollow or else much practise enabled him
to earn much liquor the man was just
drunk enough to be ugly
   he was standing before a betting-stool
angrily tearing up tickets on the last race
when tenney sighted him there was on
his face the scowl of the bad loser by his
side was one of the touts of the morning
apparently pleading with firkins to follow
his judgment in the next race but firkins
had evdiently been losing on the first thre
races-it was mid-aftemoon now and half
the days card had been run off
  for he waved the tout away from him
refusing to be cajoled the tout slunk
sulkily away and tenney approached the
buyer of champagnc he touched him on
the shoulder and firkins turned
  well what do you want he demanded
angrily
  the apple-carts upset said tenney
with an air of caution i was told to tip
you off
  the drunken man stared slowly the
cryptic meaning of tenneys words pene-
trated his intelligence
  you mean that marcy-
   the strong fingers of tenney gripped the
mans wrist

adventure
  well mr henry davis otherwise
leter firkins i guess thats enough come
along with me
fq at eight oclock that same
night tenney entered the private
office of the secretary of war
already in the room were the secretary
dilkes stenographer colwell and first-
assistant secretary jamieson the eager
secretary did not bother to make intro-
ductions he did not wait until tenney was
fairly within the room
  have you got him have you got
him you phoned that-
  i know where he is said tenney
but before i tell his name before an arrest
is made maybe youd like to be as certain
as i am
  of course of course cried the secre-
tary tell us-tell us how you-
  tenney sank into a chair as he did so
he squirmed and reached behind him he
pulled forth a revolver and laid it on his
knees
  excuse me he said but sitting on
knobby steel aint pleasant he looked
about him at his auditors a hard light in
his eyes
  never go anywhere without this little
gun he said i can sure use it too
  then he leaned comfortably back in his
chair playing with apparent idleness with
his weapon dilkes unseen by the others
loosened his own revolver in the patent
holster in his waistcoat dilkes of them
all was the only one who knew that tenney
never played with deadly weapons dilkes
wanted to be ready
  this morning said tenney i saw a
man buying wine nothing strange about
that durin the racin season only-i knew
the mans face and didnt know his name
and when i saw his name on a hotel register
the name didnt fit the face something
queer about that gentlemen
  im not infallible-not by a long shot
but give me face and give me name and ill
remember the time and place where i met
the man if it was thirty years ago but
id never met a man named peter firkins
which was the name of my wine-buying
friend funny thing for i knew his
 f ilcc
   i forgot the little puzzle a while later
though for you mr secretary gave me
something else to think about but the
puzzle came back to me a while later fr
i happened to be in the post-office and
there i saw a name that fitted the face of
the wine party and name and face
brought back time and event id seen my
wine-buying friend two years ago in the
post-office during an investigation id
learned liis name then
   well gentlemen i was on another case
and the fact that a postal clerk was using
another name didnt interest me just then
at least it wouldnt have interested me if
it hadnt happened that this clerks hours
were from two until ten and if it hadnt
also happened that between those hours he
canceled all the mail that came from a
certain city district
  yes gentlemen this clerk davis that
id seen masquerading as firkins took in
all the letters that certain carriers brought
to the post-office between two and ten
and among those certain carriers were the
carriers who collected mail from the war
department or the near vicinity yes
his hours and duties were all printed on the
paper the post-office people showed me
  and gentlemen-that made me mighty
interested in davis-firkins for some one
was stealing war-departnient secrets and
selling them to the japs and gentlemen
it was impossible for any one but the secre-
tary his assistant or his stenographer to
steal these secrets
   his fingers closed about his gun and his
stem eyes swept the room
  dont any one move please until ive
finished hesnapped then he resumed
it also seemed impossible for any of these
three to be the guilty party but gentle-
men it was impossible for an outsider to
steal the secrets it only seemed impossible
for the secretary his assistant or his
stenographer to steal them
  the stolen plans were mailed gentle-
men they were mailed-so that no person
could be traced-to an agent of japan it
seemed impossible that any of the three
persons ive named could have mailed those
plans because the envelope containing
them was postmarked at  p m and
none left the office until six and tgures
cant lie but i saw the way in which
the man who made the figures could lie
  i saw the way and i had seen the man
who had it in his power to save the traitor
from suspicion in the event of discovery o
the theft of the plans i had seen tna
figures cant lie

 postal clerk buying champagne in the com-
 pany of racing men-men who were with
 him to bleed him
   gentlemen i looked up the postal clerk
 i found that he was poor not so very long
 ago that he had no money outside his
 salary that no inheritance had been left
 him i then looked up one of the three
 men who knew of the plans because he had
 helped draw them up then i arrested
 the agent of japan then i arrested davis-
 firkins and he gave himself away some
 one he drawled might as well do a little
 confessing its good for the soul
   for a moment there was a dead silence
 then the secretary spoke
   did the jap speak did the postal
clerk confess
   tenney shook his head
   neither of them havent bothered to
question them i know without them
the plans were mailed to marcy last night
-after six the man who mailed them
dreaded discovery he feared to deliver the
plans m person or through an agent lest he
be traced so he mailed them but even
then there might be discovery as indeed
there was and he was cautious-oh
cautious as the devil makes his own who
betray their native land so he bribed a
postal clerk bribed him to stamp letters
with a cancelation mark timedearlier than
the letters were mailed it was clever--
too clever
   if the traitor had made it seem possible
 that an outsider had stolen the plans he
 might not have been suspected but the
 traitor had to come to this building to get
 the plans he wranted his after-hours visit
 to seem innocent and so it would have
 seemed with the envelope canceled-hours
 before that night visit if it had not been
 that the tool he used was weak if it had
 not been that davis could not stand pros-
 perity and that i-that im lucky
   as it is colwell you might as well
own up why i even know that vou own
a portable typewriter which you brought
m here lest the print of the office machine
be recognized
 the stenographer leaped to his feet
   i own up for gods sake mr
detective you dont accusc me of-of be-
traying my country
you live m one of the most expensive
private htes in the city snapped ten-
- and your salary is thirty dollars a
 week care to own up it may make
 things easier for you
    colwell turned to the secretary
    mr secretary you wont listen to this
 man s jumble of falsehoods i-why i
 dont know what hes talking about as
 for my money-my living at the allerton
 why-you yourself know that my family
 is wealthy that i only entered the depart-
 ment because i chose it for my career
 you-dont believe him-dont-with his
 absurd deductions his drunken men hi
 postal clerks his-
tenney rose and walked to the door
you dont have to believe me mr
secretary the night-watchman who let him
into the building at eight oclock last niht
is outside
    he flung the door open
    cavanaugh he said to the man stand-
 ing outside come in point out the man
 you admitted into the building last night
  ou told me that you let a man in here and
 that he earned a bundle about the size of a
 portable typewriter you said you thought
 nothing of it because hed done it several
 times before saying he had work to make
 up i didn t ask you his name because i
 knew it point him out cavanaugh
    the watchman rubbed his hands nervous-
 ly together
    why you aint forgotten me let ting
 you in last night have you ir tauiie-
 son
    there was torturing silence for a moment
  then tenney gently pushed the watchman
  out and closed the door he stared down
  at the first-assistant secretary of wax
  the man above suspicionwho had
  sunk into a chair his face hidden in his
  hands
 jamieson jamieson gasped the secre-
tary not you not you my own as-
sistant appointed by the president himself
not you whose grandfather was at cha-
pultepec whose father was at gettysburg
whose brother died in cuba not you-
not you-jamieson not you
 there came no answer from the stricken
traitor the secretarys horrified grief
turned to anger he strode to the limp
hgure in the chair and shook him no
answer he bent over him pulling the shield-
ing hands from the face a moment he
stared then he arose shocked sadness in
his eyes he straightened the hands of
the man whom discovery had slain

adventure
  its better this way far better he said
the name of jamieson stands high in the
nations scroll of heroes let us forget
i im willing to hand it to you
 tenney said dilkes next morning
you certainly tackled a hard
proposition and not even your luck can
take away your credit but old man
when you told us you knew the traitor
werent you-er-patting yourself a bit on
the back werent you-er-bragging
when you said before you began work on
the case that you knew the identity of the
traitor
  tenney grinned
  you aint got the memory i have
chief or else youd know that i didnt sav
that i knew who the traitor was i said i
knew where he was i knew he was in the
war department all the time come again
chief you aint caught me yet
  i wonder if any one ever will said
dilkes thoughtfully

        he heavy roar of a gun-shot
broke the afternoon hush send-
ing a bevy of mesa quail scurry-
ing up the rocky hillside it
to and fro along the walls of the
finally rolling out upon the flat at
the mouth of the canon in a very volume of
sound
  john wilkes ex - deputy sheriff cow-
puncher prospector on occasion came to
the door of his store and stared up the val-
ley from under the sharp of his hand
  now i wonder what in the world them
fools wants to go about the land shootin
their guns off fer an skeerin out of the
county what little game theres been left in
it dailey ought to know better even if
boaz dont they aint either of em got
brains enough to freight a louse with
  he stood for a moment staring up the
canon his gray beard moving slowly up
and down like a goats as he thoughtfully
masticated his tobacco and then passing
inside the building he devoted himself to a
methodical re-arrangement on the shelves
of what little stock his store boasted
  it was not an alluring place preciosa
why it should have been so named none
but heaven knew there was indeed no
special reason why it should ever have been
settled at all mr wilkes who had wan-
dered foot-loose over arizona for more than
thirty-five years had his own theories on
the reasons for the original settlement of
arizona
  it aint no example of a country where
a virtuous an hard-workin peasantry set-
tled to git freedom to worship god like
i read of in a book once -an they didnt
come out here becase they coveted a acre
of gods footstool to raise their children
an perpetuate their virtues that makes the
the salters

safeguard of a state i heard a feller say
that once at a fourth ojuly meetin- no
sir it aint none o them that aint the
way arizona come to be settled she got
settled the reason you find so many hell-
holes with people in em down here in the
southwest is because people was movin
through here to git to a better place an
their cattle died they couldnt git away
and they had to stay
  in which remark there was much truth
  he was disturbed at his quasi-quiet task
of re-arranging his stock by the entrance of
two men who stamped their way into the
cool interior of the adobe building demand-
ing beer mr wilkes produced three bot-
tles-warm opened them by the simple pro-
cess of knocking off the necks against his
spurred heel and set them on the counter
silence reigned while the three men gulped
down the warm beer
  this is shore a pleasant place ejacu-
lated dailey staring out into the hot sun-
shine where the heat-horizon of the desert
fairly winked at him
  well- mr wilkes spat judicially at a
tarantula that was striving vainly to carry
off the body of a dead desert rat-i like
it
  you-like-it boaz stared at him
  yep i like it oh i dont mean im
plumb foolish about it but i do like it after
a fashion that is i like it about as much
as a man would like bein scalped
  boaz snorted like a horse
  youre a-fool john he said ami-
ably
  sure i am agreed mr wilkes what
else would i be here fer tell me that
  boaz did not answer but stood looking
out across the plain that wrapped preciosa
as in a blanket
preciosa stands out upon the
brown desert exactly as a cake of
chocolate stands out upon a mahog-
any table there is nothing there if one
excepts the public corral built of long-dis-
carded railroad cross-ties stood on end and
interlaced with branches of long-dead mes-
quit the one well from which alkali water
is pumped by a lame white horse that
blindfolded tramps his wean round pump-
ing up the water which mr wilkes sells for
ten cents a bucketful john wilkess store
and hotel and three other houses near the
little railroad station

  the one thing that gives the place any
importance in the scheme of things is the
fact that preciosa is the railroad station for
fort stevens distant twenty miles due
north and fort stevens during these days
when the mexican border was being as
closely guarded as the convents were guard-
ed during the thirty years war was an
important point being the station of the
th regiment of cavalry to which force
for its sins was assigned the pleasant duty
of policing and patroling the adjacent sec-
tion of the mexican-american international
line
  the population of preciosa has never ex-
ceeded thirty people the three white men
who were as regular in their attendance at
mr wilkes saloon as the minute-hand upon
a watch were wilkes himself peter dailey
and tom boaz the last-named men were
partners in a great if unremunerative cattle
ranch a few miles to the west of preciosa
on this particular occasion they had met as
usual to discuss grievances
  i been talkin to boaz this mornin
john said mr dailey do you know
that old colonel borden thats been in com-
mand at fort stevens fer the past two
years
  as well as i know my own dog said
mr wilkes only i aint got no dog
hes sure gettin some afflictin with his
my man this an my man that whenever
he sees me my names dailey an he knows
it an some day im goin to flx him sos
hell remember it-
  he lapsed into silence eyed by the ob-
servant mr wilkes who was morally cer-
tain there was something in the wind
  say john he said presently are you
aimin to sell that claim of voum up the
canon the one by willow water i
mean
  i been aimin to sell it fer some time
replied the cautious mr wilkes but i
took a rotten bad aim the man got
away
  who was he john
  i dont know rightly he told me he
was the dead agent fer the district
  the-the what
  the dead agent -
  what in-s a dead agent john
  thats what i asked him he told me
that the dead agent was the man who has
the contract to supply able-bodied voters
fer every democrat whos died in the

adventure
district since the last election thats
why he left before i got the chance to un-
load that claim on him
  what do you want fer it
  it aint fer sale declared the astute
mr wilkes not now not till  know
somethin more about it
  why not you aint got nothin up
there-
  oh yes  have too i got an eighty-
foot tunnel all timbered up-
  you never got no color there did you
mr wilkes started to shake his
head then stopped so suddenly that
his hat fell oil he replaced it
thinking rapidly he remembered the gun-
shot up the valley and he knew that both
boaz and dailey were too lazy to wander
so far from home afoot after the small game
of the canon they might have been blast-
ing on his old claim he had spent bis last
dollar on it the year before and had never
got enough gold out of the entire eighty
feet of tunnel to fill a tooth with as he
expressed it
  disheartenment however was far from
him he well knew the truth of the miners
maxim that gold is where you find it
perhaps boaz and dailey had something
up their sleeves and would let him in on it
certainly he would gain nothing by hurry-
ing them he would let them take their
time
  what do you fellers mean he asked
slowly whats the game
  oh nothin we just thought wed offer
you some spot cash fer that old claim
what do you want it fer
  its a good hole an its a deep hole
said dailey reflectively an me an boaz
thought maybe we might make a grub-
stake by cuttin it up into post-holes an
shippin it north where the squatters is ta-
kin up land-
  he successfully dodged the empty bottle
that mr wilkes threw at him and returned
to the charge
  on the level john me an boaz is get-
tin darned tired of bein always called my
man by that ol-of- he hesitated for
a name-ol lord cornwallis-hes dead
an cant kick-up at fort stevens were
aimin to get a few dollars out o this an
get the ol colonel to move back to eng-
land again are you on
  mr wilkes yelped joyfully he too had
had more than lis share of the colonels
superiority
whatll you take to let us work it
john
  one-third share in whatevers goin you
to pay all expenses said mr wilkes cau-
tiously he had been stung before by his
two friends and would take no chances
done put it down on paper
  mr wilkes drawing forth a scrap of
wrapping-paper and the stump of a pencil
carefully set to work on the contract inter-
larding his scholastic efforts with audible
sucks at his pencil
  we had hard luck last month john we
lost a bunch of pretty good hereford cattle
we was aimin to ship em fast but some
greaser across the line wished for em be-
fore we got a chance to ship we had em
in the big pasture an they got across the
line an cut the fence one of our greaser
herders went at the same time we had to
lick him once before fer earn in a runnin
iron under his saddle an brandin maverick
calves-
  i never could see what you two was doiv
in puttin a wire fence around a pasture so
close to the line you might have knovcd
that that fence was like a advertisement to
them greasers savin i got a good thing
here come an get it what you wanted
to fence in two thousand acres of bare des-
ert for gets me its like puttin a fence
around a graveyard them thats in cant
git out an them thats out dont want to
git in-fer no good purpose that is-
  thats so john said boaz softly
but we may break even after all weve
got four witnesses to the fact that the
fence was cut an two of em swear that
the men that done the cuttin was mexican
soldiers weve got all kinds of affidavits
to that-
  object bein- queried mr wilkes
if one regiment of cavalry spends twelve
thousand dollars of pay in a month in a
place somebodys makin money reflect-
ed mr dailey therell be beef contracts
an oat an hay contracts an if any more
troops should be sent here to help us poor
citizens tryin to wrest a livin from a fruit-
less soil-
i get you said mr wilkes joyfully
an we sent our affidavits to our rep-
resentative in c ongress assembled an john
if youd only hear colonel borden up at
the post about his havin to split up his
the salters

regiment to guard the border youd think
hell had sure broke loose at last
   where does he come in at
   he got orders to send detachments out
all along the line to watch the waler-holes
to pertect the lives an property of-
   you an boaz there aint no work in
guardin your property youre settin
down in em all the time-
   so seein that colonel bordens got a
pile o cash an a most unlovely disposition
me an boaz has decided that he aint a de-
sirable citizen were goin to move him
east john he thinks hes a fine pros-
pector an knows all about minerals ill
bet he never saw nothin like this look
he tossed a bit of shining quartz upon
the counter under the nose of the aston-
ished mr wilkes
   mr wilkes examined it carefully-
  that neser come from my claim he
said presently having subjected the sam-
ple to every improvised test that he could
think of at the moment
  it sure did john it come from that
very claim said boaz signing his name to
the paper that mr wilkes had completed
out of the shaft
   often the ore-dump
   youre a liar said mr wilkes pleas-
antly there never was enough gold on
that whole dump to fill a tooth with
  a sudden thought occurred to him and
he sat down upon an up-ended box laugh-
ing till the tears ran down his face
  go on he gasped go on you
twoll be the death of me yit only mind
you i dont know nothin about the mat-
ter im just a-rentin my claim to you two
to work an im in on one-third of it joke
or not no matter how you git it
   im plain astonished at you john said
mr dailey in a tone of pained surprise
were goin to work that claim of course
weve got to get capital to start it with
but we aint lookin to have no trouble in
gettin all the capital we want-
   you wont have-none at all if you go
after it like that gasped mr wilkes
youll git it an in the meantime ill keep
this paptr
   he folded up the painfully written docu-
ment and thrust it into his pocket and
stood watching the two men who had slow-
ly mounted and were plodding westward
into the red-hot dust of the arizona after-
noon
n
      i tell you frankly may i am
getting very tired of stumbling over
that young cub mr needham
every time i enter the house he is quite as
bad as your aunt mollies dogs i have to
stand the dogs but i simply will not have
that youngster it seems to me that you
should have more regard for what you know
my wishes are than to have him here where
you know well he is not welcome-
  miss allardvce toying with her grape-
fruit made a little grimace at her uncle be-
fore she replied sweetly
  i really do not see why it bothers you
uncle he does not come to see you and
as he never comes when you are in the
house i really do not see quite how it can
actually annoy you since you assure me it
does i will tell him that you do not wish to
see him what time shall i tell him that
you will be out
 out out who the deuce said i
would be out i suppose i have a perfect
right to say who shall and who shall not
come to my house
  you can not well shut the door of your
house upon an officer of your own regiment
without giving some reason and that a good
one mr needham comes here for two
reasons the first is because i asked him
to do so the second is-
  she paused provokingly rose and strolled
to the long glass that hung between the
windows
  well are you or are you not going to
finish what you started to say you have
many bad habits but none so bad as that
am i to be kept waiting all day to hear
your second reason what the devil is
your second reason miss
  i have an idea-now mind you uncle
jim it is really no more than an idea i
may not be right-i would not say it
though unless i had some really good
reason for believing my informant to be
correct any wav i did it all for the
best you know that dont you uncle
good heavens say it what do you
mean by gabbling over what you have to say
like two women talking gossip out with it
what does he come here for
   think its aunt mollie said may al-
lardvce softly
  for one moment colonel borden looked
long at his pretty niece it was a long

adventure
steady look during which miss allardyce
wondered vaguely if he were on the verge
of a paralytic stroke as he strove vainly
for speech his face was as red as the crest
of an angry turkey gobbler
  there was nothing for him to say how-
ever and miss allardyce when she thought
of her aunt of whom she was really very
fond figuring in a flirtation with a bachelor
lieutenant of cavalry her aunt with the
stature and the mustache of a wurttemberg
hussar her aunt for his marriage with whom
it was vaguely whispered in the regiment
her uncle had been given his medal of hon-
or with its motto for valor  i say when
she thought of all this miss allardyce burst
into soft laughter
  colonel borden boiled over with wrath
he had come down to breakfast a half-hour
before in the worst possible temper so that
the cook noting it took time to feed the
orderly first so that when the inevitable
message should be sent to direct some one
to report to the colonel the orderly at least
should not be hungry she also cautioned
the orderly to look out for himself strongly
advising him to be suddenly taken ill and
to go  sick report
  mind the weather this mornin lewis
th ol mans the divvle the day sure the
c o w which is army argot for com-
manding officers wife been givin him
what-for since she got up norah just told
me that theyve been rowin again over miss
may sure they always do its a pity
they cant let the girl alone shes more
sensen the pair of em go on sick report
i tell you
       all colonels of cavalry are pecu-
liar that is an axiom if it re-
quires proof any subaltern of cav-
alry can give it-to the point of profanity
colonel borden was no exception to the
rule an irate troop commander called
upon once to express his idea upon the rea-
son why so many colonels were peculiar
voiced the generally accepted belief in the
words
  ill tell you why it is its because
theyre driven crazy when theyre captains
thats why it is
  he was an unbending martinet of the
severest school which means the type which
can see no reason or excuse for any short-
coming in any one but himself no man
resents severity provided only it be based
on justice injustice severity and incom-
petence make a bad trinity and have broken
the backs of many competent juniors
  he was even worse than his officers called
him in the privacy of their own rooms for
to the credit of that regiment be it said
in public they upheld him no higher
praise can be uttered he was almost as
bad as the regimental sergeant - major
called him which was singularly like a per-
sonage mentioned in the book of revela-
tions
  he was extremely close in money mat-
ters and was never known to entertain any-
one except the department commander on
the rare occasions of his visits to the post
but most of liis shortcomings were condoned
at least on account of his niece-may allar-
dyce
  may allardyce was young and may al-
lardyce was more than a little pretty e ven
the young married ladies of the regiment
said so and that is proof incontestable
also she possessed a quiet charm that made
even the more confirmed bachelors thin
twice about the doubtful advantage tha
they possessed in times of moving when all
they had to do was to pour water on the
fire and call the dog better still if that
indeed was needed may allardyce would
be rich in her own right
  her mother had been colonel bordens
favorite sister in so far as he could be
said to have shown affection for any one he
had shown it for his sister and for her hus-
band tom allardyce who dying left liis
wife the sole heir to his immense fortune
unfortunately she soon followed her hus-
band and when her will was read it was
found to contain the somewhat curious pro-
vision that while may was to have a com-
fortable income when she should come f
age on her eighteenth birthday yet she
would not inherit the bulk of the property
in its entirety until she was twenty-one
years of age
  she was forbidden to marry before her
twenty-first birthday
  people seeing her denied nothing that
money could buy from the days of her first
living with the bordens at first thought
that her luxuries were the outcome of
avuncular affection no one knew that
tom allardyce had left nearly three millions
of dollars to the pretty little girl who was a
favorite with every one of the officers ant-
most of their wives
the salters

   as a matter of fact it was not generally
known colonel borden her uncle was
also her guardian and he had no mind to
surrender until the latest possible moment
his stewardship over the pleasant little bun-
galow on chesapeake bay that boasted the
finest duck-shooting on the eastern waters
nor the cottage at palm beach where he
could have as guests men whose words
would mean much if he should ever desire
a pleasant detail in washington the mecca
of old officers
  thus is it done kissing goes by favor
and there are man- kinds of kisses he re-
turned to the charge
   i fail to see why you want that shave-
tail -a generic army title for an officer
of less than five years service derived prob-
ably from the fact that when young mules
are first purchased for the service the con-
tractor has their tails shaved to tell them
from the other mules-hanging around you
all day why dont you like captain
evans
  he has had two wives uncle jim-
   the fatal gift of beauty said her uncle
savagely evans was so ugly that it was a
common report in the regiment that even
his own dog ran away from him
   striker then
  he has white eyes and he sniffles-
  johnson then ha youve got noth-
ing to say have you what fault can you
find with mr johnson
  case-hardened as may allardyce was to
her uncles unpleasantnesses even she lacked
courage to tell her uncle that her chief ob-
jection to mr johnson lay in the fact that
he was known to be the colonels pet and
was strongly suspected of being a tale-bear-
er let a man once get that reputation in
the army let him once be known as a
boot-licker-one who curries favor by
adroitly pandering to the weaknesses of a
superior-and that man had better hang
himself
may allardyce her break-
fast finished sat contemplatingly
eying her uncle as he fussed about
the room picking up a cigar here a paper
there and when he stamped out upon the
sunlit porch with a testy call of orderly
she breathed a sigh of relief
  mr needham a hundred yards farther
down t he line as officers line is commonly
called standing discreetly on the off side of
 his horse busied himself with a refractory
 stirrup-leather till he saw the broad back of
 his superior disappear in the administra-
 tion building when he walked lightly
 up the line and entered the forbidden
 ground
   no poaching please uncle is as mad as
 -as- may stopped for a simile oh
 gerald he said all kinds of nasty things this
 morning hes awful-
   of course he is show me the man who
 denies it
   mr needham promptly drew the girl be-
 hind the sheltering vines that massed on the
 end of the porch what took place under
 those vines is no business of yours or of mine
 but mrs fantcr who lived next door nearly
 got a stiff neck through twisting her hea l
 around the corner of her sitting-room window
 to get a clear look she found that she
 could not see them from her bedroom
   its perfectly disgusting she declaimed
 to her bosom friend mrs burr my dear
 i sat and watched them for twenty minutes
 every one knows that he is crazy about her
 and that she has just tfung herself at his
 head every one knows that colonel bor-
 den hates young mr needham and that he
 will not allow any one but his own pets to
 show may any attentions no my dear i
 must say i do not think she is exactly pretty
 -and there they stood for a half hour i
 saw them as plainly as i see you this min-
 ute he had his arms about her and her
 head was on his shoulder and he was kiss-
 ing her simply disgusting i call it-
   the episode under the vines however
that so upset mrs fanter did not affect
needham seriously fifteen minutes later
miss allardyce reappeared very flushed as
to her countenance and very bright as to
the eyes
   i tell you darling quoth mr need-
 ham  i do not want to be disrespectful in
 speaking of your uncle but he is an old
 devil-
   he is he is worse than that if i could
 only think of what to call him
   he is very foolish even- one knows
that he is trying to make you accept the at-
tentions of his own favorites here evans-
he s a nice enough fellow-or striker-or
johnson it is a purely personal dislike
that he has taken to me and he will not ad-
mit that he is wrong there is nothing that
he can show against me or against mv
record
adventure
  just let him try it-just once said
may viciously
  her pretty cliin went up in air needharn
laughed lightly
  im going to propose formally to you-
sweetheart will you marry me he asked
quietly his gleaming eyes belying the quiet-
ness
  of course i will
  she leaned lightly toward him and he
took both hands in his raising them to hi
lips and kissing the rosy tinted palms
  then-mind you darling it will be un-
pleasant for us both-i am going straight
to your uncle and ask him for his consent
to our engagement he is sure to say no
but that doesnt make the least difference
in the world if he says no he has to give
a reason he is certain to be unpleasant to
me and probably to you but we can not
have things go on in this way any
longer it is not fair to either of us the
first thing we know some of these old
catsll be talking about you and i do not
propose to have any one talking about my
wife
  she colored warmly at the proud posses-
sion of the tone but nodded brightly
  i didnt think you would have the cour-
age she said lightly
  courage i why id charge hell with
a bucket of water for you meet me in an
hour at the tennis-court will you-just
one-
  that one multiplied by ten being com-
pleted and a very thoro uglily kissed
young lady having vanished into the
house gerald needham went jauntily to
the office
  if the red face of the orderly standing
just outside the door of the holy of holies
had not informed him that the official ba-
rometer of courtesy registered low that
morning needham would have read it the
moment he stepped inside the door of the
adjutants office which led to the colonels
room for the adjutant his face bent low
over his desk was red to the top of his
scalp and he toiled with a fervor that
was too feverish to have lasted long he
looked up as needham with a cheerful
hello burke whats new entered the
room
  lissht ssi cautioned the shocked ad-
jutant
  wtiats the matter anybody dead
queried the unimpressed needham
  shut up you -fool the old mans
on the rampage this morning
  ah and i suppose every one in the
whole rouud world must tremble and kow-
tow until it pleases his august majesty to
shed the light of his countenance upon us
once again hence slave and tell tbv mas-
ter i defy him give him my gage-it s
twelve-bore-double choked sirct lve been
here sigi da gup an burke theres a good
chap tell the old man that id like a few
moments conversation with him that is i
mean i want a chance to do about two min-
utes talking myself not for him to do it
as i said burke sigi dagupan
   that word or expression rather has been
the sliibboleth of the new army by which
i mean the army that had its beginning in

      captain burke disappeared
into the inner office whence an omi-
 nous clearing of the throat which
was to the colonel what the rasping threat
chuckle at the sight of freh meat is to the
cage-born lion announced that the old
man was ready for a meal needham en-
tered
  good morning sir
  hm what do you want to see me
nosir to speak to you fora moment
well you will have to be quick sir
dont you see i am busy
   so am i sir i will not take more than
a few minutes of your time i have come
colonel borden to speak to you on a pri-
vate matter i wish to ask vour consent
to my marriage to your niece-
  for three long minutes an awful silence
reigned a silence that was broken only by
the ticking of the office clock and by the
shuffling of papers in the office of the ad-
jutant
  needham looked at his superior with
some curiosity colonel borden was al-
most bursting with illy suppressed rage his
face mottled red and white like a well-mar-
blcd piece of ham as he stared at needham
from behind his desk presently
  what- what- mr needham sir
this is the most udparalelled piece of im-
pertinence that even you have ever been
guilty of--
  needhams eyes grew steely in their in-
tensity and his mouth set in tense clean-
cut lines any one who knew him could
have told colonel borden what that look
the salters

meant his voice was as sweet as strained
honey but there was a ring in it that
meant fight
  colonel borden i must inform you with
all respect that i permit no man living to
speak to me in this way i have come to
you to prefer a formal request because that
form is prescribed by convention i knew
when i came what your answer would be
that makes no difference i shall not per-
mit you to insult me my record both per-
sonal and official is clean except for one
slurring remark that you yourself placed
upon my efficiency report which an in-
spector decided was the result of personal
prejudice on your part my income is the
income of any officer of my grade i am not
in debt a cent miss allardyce has honored
me by-v
  leave my office sir
  i warn you sir one more word in that
tone and manner and i will request an offi-
cial investigation of you and your methods
by an inspector general i will not allow
you to be discourteous to me simply be-
cause you think that you can get away
with it because you are a colonel and i a
mere lieutenant so unfortunate as to be
placed under your command is your an-
swer yes or no sir
  no no a thousand times no sir
you are not to speak to her again do you
understand that
 one moment colonel borden you
seem to strangely misunderstand both your
position and my own if i have done any-
thing to merit such a diatribe as you
have favored me with i merit a trial i
know very well sir that if you had the
slightest grounds for preferring charges
against me you would have done so long
ago so long as i am who i am and my
record such as it is i shall insist on and re-
quire sir from you the same courtesy that
i in turn am required to show as for your
consent to our marriage i never expected
you to give it i asked it as mere formality
and i tell you frankly sir that as soon as
may is twenty-one next month we intend
to be married either with or without that
consent good morning sir
  he stepped out into the hall and meet-
ing the white-faced orderly whose mouth
was lianging open like the mouth of a fish
lie realized that every- word of his conver-
sation had been overheard and would be
common property by noon
ill
rjjj gerald needham went to his
imus quarters in a dangerously quiet
mood furiously angry as he was
he was quite aware of the fact that the
slightest false move on his part now would
bring colonel borden upon him as he ex-
pressed it like a duck on a june bug
  so far his own demeanor and conduct
had been perfectly correct and within the
spirit and the letter of the regulations but
he knew that if he should make the least
slip from the standard of official correct-
ness he would receive no mercy evans
striker johnson could miss morning sta-
bles be late for drill forget to sign the
book for official papers and nothing would
happen but let him do one of these sins
and he would figure as the accused before
a general court-martial now however
that open war had been declared he knew
where he stood and could prepare for any
move of the enemy
  the first move came when being en-
gaged in changing from riding-boots to ten-
nis shoes he heard a knock at the door a
sprucely clad orderly entered at the shout-
ed come in
  i have a paper here sir for the lieu-
tenant
  needham took the paper signed the book
and opened the envelope it was a type-
written order on which the ink was not yet
dry and it read
  st lt gerald needham b cav and ten men
will procced at once mounted to the international
boundary line west of and in the vicinity of pre-
ciosa for the purpose of enforcing the neutrality
laws
  rations for thirty days will be taken
  the detachment will tale no tentage but shelter
tents
                 by order of col borden
                      john burke
                         capt th cav
                                 adjutant
  darn his old skin first move to him
this is the first time in the history of this
post that an officer has had to go into the
field without a tent hed send me out
naked if he dared
  sir the adjutant directed me to tell
the lieutenant that sergeant wilson has
been directed to report to him for orders
the commanding officer directs that the
lieutenant leave iifan hour
ali right there is no reply orderly

adventure
  the soldier saluted and left passing as he
went out sergeant wilson who was com-
ing up the steps to get his orders
  all right sergeant i know ajl about it
tell the first sergeant to make the detail
and notify the men yourself so they can
get ready tell the quartermaster ser-
geant to pack at once thirty days rations
for eleven men and overhaul the pack-sad-
dles and look over the mules you will need
seven pack-mules the forage will be sent
by wagon of course we will leave in an
hour have the trumpeter saddle my
horse and bring him to the door in half an
hour
  sergeant wilson saluted and departed
and needham set to work rolling up his
bedding filling his flask and canteen and
packing up what few little luxuries he could
carry that would make life more endurable
on that hell-hole of a border
  he well knew what his life would be he
had been there before for two months in
very nearly the same locality he would
make his camp as near water as he could
and the nearer to it he got the more trouble
would he have with the cattle stampeding
in from the range to get at the water
twice he had had his own horses stampeded
by it costing him two days of hard work to
get them again
  for a mile around his camp the ground
would be covered with the dead bodies of
cattle that had died within the past year
in their attempt to get to water only too
often dying when in sight of it but too
weak to reach it he would have flies
thousands of them almost as big as spar-
rows bred in those same dead cattle he
would be afhictcd with dust-storms that
would follow him around by day and go to
bed with him at night he would exist in
a temperature of never less than  de-
grees and he would learn all over again to
smoke tobacco that was half wind-blown
cow-dung
  that would be by day by night it would
be different for as soon as the darkness
should shut down and the sun drop below
the saw-toothed range of the raw red
western hills there would come a wind out
of the desert-a raw cold wind that would
drive the men inside their tiny shelter-tents
for very warmth where they would shiver
in their clothes and one blanket till sun-up
  there would be alarms from people un-
heard of about parties unknown who were
always just about to cross the border with
arms and ammunition but who never got
there the point where they were to cross
the line would always be ten miles distant
he would be riding and roasting by day and
freezing and shivering by night for a month
striving to enforce laws that no one knew
his orders given his bedding-roll
placed upon the porch where the
packers could get it when the mules
were ready he buckled on his revolver and
went to the tennis-court where may was
waiting for him she caught sight of him
when he was a hundred yards away and
ran toward him swinging her racket
  whats the matter--dear she almost
whispered seeing him in field garb is
there any trouble
  only for us im sorry to say-sweet-
heart his voice lingered over the sweet-
est word in the english language and he
caught the hand that held the racket care-
less of who might see
  your respected and revered old uncle
has seen fit to send me an order sendir g
me to preciosa on field duty for a month
what why gerald you only came
back last month you cant be next on the
roster arc you
  of course not there are five lieuten-
ants here who have not been out at all
its because i had the temerity to fall in
love with vou
  what
  needham nodded
  he was so mad he said grinning at
the recollection that i thought for a mo-
ment he was going to burst i remember
being grateful for the fact that he did not
burst on me
  what did he say gerald asked miss
allardyce giggling	n
  pardon me  never use such language
tell me at once-dear she entreated
half tearfully needham relented
  he said a lot of things first he said
no no no five or six times then he said
the first word ol god save the king and
mixed that up with a lot of plain ordinary
words in which i understood him to express
a positive conviction as to my ultimate des-
tiny he was rather comprehensive in his
statements and he was so mad that i ex-
pected to see him burst into a blare i only
cot the order a few minutes ago i go to
preciosa
the salters

  what did you tell him gerald
  i told him that i was asking him for his
permission to marry you because i thought
it was the proper thing to make a request
like tiiat but that i was going to marry
you whether he liked it or not just as soon
as you are twenty-one years of age
  you dear-i think id like to kiss you
gerald i think hes perfectly horrid but
im not going to let him see it
  she thought for a moment then slipping
her hand under his arm she pulled him
lightly under the shade of a giant cotton-
wood tree that shaded the court
  gerald she said presently i am going
to speak seriously for a moment have we
been simply flirting with each other to pass
away the time
  the youngsters face whitened slowly un-
der her words he looked at her steadily
for a moment his eyes narrowing to pin-
points he noted the quick warm flush
that mounted from cheek to brow and he
saw her eyes wrhich were as the eyes of a
bride and his own face cleared
  you know better he said simply
you know dear heart that it is for ever
and ever
  then before you go away today write
a request for a leave of absence for four
months to take effect a month from tues-
day tuesday will be the eighteenth can
you get it
  the old-i mean your uncle-will dis-
approve my request of course but what is
the use of having an uncle who is a united
states senator if i cant get a little thing
like that certainly i can get it why
what is your plan
  the girl flushed again even more warm-
ly than before
  i thought she said in an embarrass-
ment that was delightful to see that a
month from tuesday will be the eighteenth
and that is my birthday i will be twenty-
one and no longer under uncle jims con-
trol well-then-then-if you really want
  she had no opportunity to finish her
speech for long before she could say any
more she found herself gathered into a pair
of brown-shirted arms her lovely blushing
face hidden beneath the brim of his cam-
paign hat
  twenty minutes later having received
his final orders from the adjutant need-
ham left the post with his little detachment
and threading the narrow dust-ribbon of a
trail with his pack-mules well closed up
ahead of him pulled out on the trail for
preciosa
  he had hastily written a letter request-
ing a leave of absence for four months so
his conscience was perfectly clear on that
point though he knew right well that colo-
nel borden would never approve it and for
the first part of the ride he was busily fra-
ming mentally a night letter to be sent from
preciosa when he should get an opportunity
to united states senator james needham
which was calculated to make tiat gentle-
man sit up and rub his head
it was not a long ride as rides go
only twenty miles but the road was
dusty beyond the power of words
to describe and there was no scenery he
knew it of old the chug chug chug of the
walking horses in the dust varied by an
occasional short trot where the prairie-dog
holes were fewest till finally the topped
the last divide from which they could
see preciosa a brown blot on a browner
plain
  it is only in novels that cavalry moves
at a gallop on a campaign or in the field
even- cavalryman knows that luck is on his
side if he can always move his entire troop
at a walk to be able to walk and trot
equally is the gift of the gods
  he was glad when they drew up in the
dust of the corral and dismounted to water
the horses at ten cents a head mr wilkes
met him at the pump greeting him with a
toothless grin
  hello son just in from the post
  yep hello mr wilkes glad to see
you whats new
  greaser baby over at juan morcllos is
the newest thing i know of but vou aint
interested in that-not yit hey
  no any arms around here any talk

  mr wilkes flung his arms wide
  good lord lieutenant you know as
well as me whats here there aint nothin
now if we only had water-we could do
anything if we had water if we only had
one-inch rainfall in a whole year we could
raise all kinds of vegetables
  needham iooked his disbelief mr
wilkes snorted
  oh we kin you neednt look like that

ax smith up at pestilente

inch pipe well fer two thousand dollars it

rest he carted the greens over to the rail-
road an sold em to the eatin-houses an
he was makin the dollars just roll in when
one of his burros turned hisself loose an
kicked out four of broad-axs front teeth

ture an theyve got a lot of hosses in there
now they claim them greaser soldiers
come across the line an cut the fence an
run the cattle ott if they done that with
cattle theyll do it a lot quicker fi r hosses
they need them fer their cavalry you know
the lines only five hundred yards from
their fence-corner
  hml im sorry to hear they lost any
stock ill do what i can to prevent it in
the future when you see dailey and boaz
mr wilkes tell em to come over an see
me will you
  i will so good-by vaya con dios as
the greasers say
  needham shook hands with him and
rode oil to the westward with his men mr
wilkes stood looking after him for a mo-
ment till he faded away swallowed up by
the swirling dust
  hes a good youngster he said reflec-
tively a good youngster i wish there was
more like him down here
iv
l ji the line runs due east and west
from preciosa and they made their
camp a mile to the west where the
corner of the wire fence that enclosed the
great two-thousand-acre pasture where
dailey and boajs kept their stock was
within five hundred yards of the inter-
national line
  at that point the boundary was marked
by a great sheet-iron monument standing
upon a small rocky hill the monument
was marked upon its northern face with the
arms of the united states of america while
the southern face showed the eagle stand-
on a cactus grasping a serpent in its talons
the symbol of mexican supremacy since the
days when in  the acolhuaos over-ran
the country from the north
  it was not an imposing camp five
shelter tents standing in one line spreading
their brown canvas to the sun showed
where the ten men skpt at one end of this
line was the improvised kitchen made by
simply scraping a narrow trench in th dir
the length lying in the direction of the pre-
vailing winds at the other end of the line
stood the shelter tent where needham slept
and in front of the line of tents lay the
griund-line two lariats stretched between
two stunted mesquit bushes where the
horses and the mules were tied
  the water-hole was about a hundred yards
to the north for work they could ride for
fifty miles over the inhospitable brown mesa
that lay like an oven under the semi-
tropical sun for diversion they could watch
the prairie dogs that yip-yapped inces-
santlv ducking into their holes at the first
sign of life from the camp
  four men will remain in camp all the
time sergeant we will have to have some
one here permanently to look after the
stock there will be three patrols to go out
daily one of two men will ride east for
about ten miles and one will ride west about
ten miles returning by sundown the
other two men will watch the railroad ani
the station at preciosa who s that coming
in now
the salters

  its me dailey lieutenant how are
you
  the cowpuncher rode up to the cook-fire
and dismounted leaving liis rein-chains
dangling he strode forward with out-
stretched hand for he knew needham and
liked him as did most men who came in con-
tact with him
  youre the very man i wanted most to
see dailey john wilkes told me that you
and boaz have lost some stock lately is
it true
  yes it was about a month ago we
had driven in a lot of hereford cattle to
fatten up an had em corralled in the big
pasture onder thats what ive come to
speak to you about the fence was cut by
some mexicans and some of the stock was
run off i think a man named lopez was
mixed up in it he was a man we fired
some time ago on suspicion theres no
question about it lieutenant they do
run stock off here an take it across the
border they sneak over at night some-
times bringin cattle over that they swap
off here to some of the mexican residents
for stolen ponies sometimes they dont
trouble to bring no cattle along the just
naturally pinch the ponies payin fer em
with the loose end of a lariat
  have you any idea how they do it
  mostly they cut our fence an steal
some outen our herd you see our boun-
dary fences run down like the letter v with
the point right here not moren five hun-
dred yards from the line naturally they
cut it right at the point thats because a
horse if hes stampeded runs straight to the
rear if they cut it on the long side the
horses might git scared an scatter if they
cut it at the point an the horses scare
theyll just run back in the pasture you
kin count on it that if they do come over
an try to cut the fence theyll do it right
here moren that the grass has been
burned off near the water-hole an with the
new grass cornin up here all the herdll be
grazin right down here if youll just
watch this fence youll see somethin i
think
  ill do better than that dailey-
  you see lieutenant if they run any
stock off theyll run em off along the low-
land in the bottom he pointed to the
draw as lowland is generally called in the
southwest in which lay the water-hole
they wont dare lake the cattle over the
hilltops your mend see em against the
skyline you neednt worry none they
wont try it till full moon an thats two
weeks away yit ill sit down awhile if you
dont mind boazs gone up into the foot-
hills to round up some cattle
  so down he sat and talked late into the
night rough as he was he had a keen
sense of humor and a stock of stories of the
range that told with rabelaisian humor
moved needham to laughter so that he was
genuinely sorry when his guest rose
  ill see you soon again dailey said as
he swung into saddle me an boazll be
ove often adios
  needham still smiling over the last story
sat listening to the patter of his ponys feet
among the rocks till the last echoes died
away in the night
the next day after much thought
he sent a man with a pack-mule into
preciosa on a mission that greatly
puzzled that hard-riding trooper need-
ham wanted six empty coal-oil cans
  a great light dawned upon the detach-
ment when they were called upon to hang
the cans to the top wire of the wire fence
one empty can near each post near the point
of the v in each can needham placed a
great rock
  i learned it in the moro country he
deigned to explain a man always cuts a
wire fence near the post i dont know why
but he does well when he cuts the wire
the canll drop an the rock in itll make
enough noise to wake the dead youll be
able to hear it all over camp thatll do
brown
  day after day the patrols rode the line
vigilantly day after day they returned
hot and dusty longing for the cool beer that
the temperance people in that outburst of
fanatical enthusiasm that leads people to
deny to others what they themselves do not
like had forbidden them
  each day too brought its new baseless
rumor once word came that a flying ma-
chine was about to smuggle field-guns
across the line to the rebels needham
got word of it by a personal note sent by
colonel borden himself and the orderly
nearly killed his horse to get the note in
promptly him the men jeered openly
again a report camethat bombs were being
shipped across the line packed in firewood
and carried on the backs of burros there

adventure
being no firewood nearer than fort stevens
the report was discounted
  with the waxing of the moon however
he grew more cautious but it was not until
one night about two weeks after his arrival
that anything actually happened
  his letter requesting his four months
leave of absence had been returned to him
bearing the one word disapproved the
colonel had evidently written it himself
and the very period after the word ex-
pressed ire needham expecting no less
upon receiving the letter saddled his horse
and rode in to preciosa to send the night
letter to his uncle the message des-
patched and its urgency explained he was
walking his horse slowly along the moonlit
road when his quick ear caught the unmis-
takable sound of iron striking against rock
he reined in his horse in the shadow of a
mesquit bush
  clear and distinct above him he saw sil-
houetted against the skyline the heads of
two men sombrero-covered leaning toward
each other in talk a moment later as he
watched he saw two lean horses heads
come into view over the hilltop above the
trail
  the sound of the hoof-beats on the rocks
ceased once he heard an impatient stamp-
ing among the rocks and the jingle of bit-
rings then a voice that said in clear sono-
rous spanish
  alio el hijo de la-
  needham heard no more and it was just as
well that he did not hear it he knew the
mexican people well enough to be able to
fill in the hiatus for there are no fouler-
swearing people on earth than the spanish-
speaking peoples compared with spanish
even arabic which is said to be a language
specially devised for the use of the afflicted
becomes mere childish prattle
  the two men were on the trail between
him and his camp if they were engaged
in an attempt to run off cattle or stock he
was convinced that the two men had been
placed so far out in order that they could
give the alarm if any one came along the
trail from the direction of preciosa the
main attempt would be made nearer to the
camp itself just as dailey had prophesied
  either of two courses was open to him
he could gallop down the trail toward his
camp taking the chance of a shot as he rode
or he could sneak up to the hillside above
the trail and work along the crest till he had
passed the two men when he could regain
his camp he chose the latter and dis-
mounting he led his horse straight up the
hillside down which the two men had come
keeping off the rocks as well as he could in
the darkness
  up up up he worked as slowly and as
carefully as a scout works in war-time when
developing a ridge that is suspected of hi-
ding a foe once a step of his horse sent a
volley of shale rock clattering down the
slope making noise enough to wake the
dead a horse whinnied in the darkness
and only his quick grasp on the nostrils of
his own steed kept him from replying he
stood in perfect silence for a moment hold-
ing up one forefoot of his horse so that he
should not make any noise by pawing the
loose shale of the hillside
  a deep-toned voice down on the trail said
clearly
  es nada nada pcro un conejo-it is
nothing but a rabbit-alerla-be quick
  and again he worked his way along the
hillside
      he had reached a point on the
      hillside almost directly opposite his
      own camp and was about to swing
into the saddle and make a dash tor hi own
detachment when clear and distinct his
ears caught the clang of a falling can then a
second clang echoed in the silence then a
third a point of flame spat out into the
darkness and a gun-shot jarred the night
  halt who goes there came the quick
challenge of the sentry in the camp
  no time now to ponder over what lo do
he pitched into his saddle and spurred into
a headlong gallop down the slope regard-
less of the prairie-dog holes that yawned for
the leaping near-fore and as his horse to-k
the slope he worked his revolver from the
holster
  he heard curses behind him thai were
followed by a shot and his campaign hat
jerked forward over his eyes and he was
suddenly aware of a sharp pain in his left
thigh as if a red-hot iron had been passed
across it the next moment he had swung
his horse into the trail and thundered up
the far slope into his camp
  the men had got to their rifles and were
standing ready for the orders that came
quick and fast
  two of you take your horses-never
mind saddling and bridling them-and ride
the salters

hcll-for-leather to where this draw crosses
the line stop any one who attempts to
pass you if they do not stop shoot
  sergeant wilson take two more men
and get to the fence and reinforce the patrol
there shoot any one you see who will not
surrender mind you dont shoot dailey
or boaz york you and wentworth take
your lariats and stretch them along the gap
in the fence where the wires have been cut
you can find the gaps by looking where
the cans are down the rest of you come
with me
  there were only two men left to follow
him and they did not follow very far for as
soon as he reached the level ground in the
bottom of the draw his left leg shut up
under him and he fell prostrate gasping
  go on men therere two men farther
on down the trail get them bring em in
or show me where theyre lyin go on you
fools im hit
  two shots from the neighborhood of the
fence broke the silence followed by the
thunder of several horses in a mad stam-
pede the lone sentry in the camp fired
twice and then he heard the stinging crack
of a rifle tired down by the line again he
heard the whirling rush of galloping horses
till the very air seemed full of it then
came a long silence-he had fainted
  when he regained consciousness-and it
could not have been more than five minutes
later-he heard his men calling to cach
other from hilltop to hilltop he rolled over
and working his revolver from the holster
fired straight up in the air presently a
man broke from the bushes and ran down
to him as he lay in the low scrub it was
earle one of his own men who almost
stumbled over him passing his arm about
his wounded officer he raised him bodily
from the ground
  hurt bad sir
  i dont know earle got a match
  yes sir
  a hastily struck match showed a gaping
tear across the leg into which one could
have laid a finger it was bleeding freely
and the khaki breeches were blood-soaked
almost as far as the knee
  only a flesh wound after all grunted
needham i dont see why  keeled over
give me your first-aid package earle
  the trooper tore it loose from his belt and
opening it tied the bandage adroitly about
the wound which was bad enough to have
bled much without being serious with
the mans aid needham got to his feet and
hobbled back to the camp where he found
the men gathered by the replenished fire
anything to report sergeant wilson
yes sir i captured one man dowm by
the fence caught him in the act of cuttin
the wires lowe shot the pony of another
one the rest of em got off i reckon sir
they was tryin to do just what mr dailey
said they would
  did they succeed in running off any
stock
   not a hair sir
take a light and examine the dead pony
for his brand and bring the prisoner to me
sergeant wilson hastened oil to do his
bidding and presently a soldier stepping
forward into the ring of the firelight said-
heres the prisoner sir
       he was a most villainous-looking
mexican black-bearded and dirty
weighted down by three bandoliers
filled with cartridges but he rolled his cigar-
ette with the insouciance that only a mexi-
can or a spaniard can affect while need-
ham seated upon a saddle on the ground
questioned him
  no intende sehor-i do not under-
stand- however being the only reply to
his questions he very soon desisted
  id make you understand if i had you
fer an hour in the bush growled the angry
sergeant there aint no better teacher of
english than a good revolver lanyard used
about a foot below the shoulders sir- he
added i examined the pony that as shot
it is one of the lazy b brand but its been
vented an theres no new brand on him
that i can see
  by which sergeant wilson meant that
the pony had originally been branded with
the letter b king down but that some one
had crossed it out
  an i can tell you about that said a
voice behind them
  needham turned to find himself face to
face with dailey
  hello dailey go ahead then tell me
what you can lo you know the man
dailey walked over to the man and
looked him over critically
  sure i know him his names lopez
he used to wtork fer us  whatll you do
w ith him
   turn him over to the sheriff i suppose
 
adventure
an let the civil authorities prosecute him
for attempted horse-stealin lord but this
leg does hurt
  dailey started  looked at needhams
white face and quickly pulling a flask from
his pocket forced a drink down the young-
sters throat
  you git on your back as quick as you
kin lieutenant an keep the blood outen
that leg if youve got any report to make
write it out an ill put it on the wire fer
you at preciosa
  needham wrote a brief report of the
occurrence on a page from his notebook and
gave it to the stockman to be telegraphed
to the post and this done bared his leg
and with daileys assistance examined the
wound the cow-puncher breathed a sigh
of relief
   was afeared it was a high-power bullet
youll be all right in a day or two its
only a scratch it aint touched bone ner
muscle now- he gave a last touch to
the rough bandage-youre as good as
new keep out of the sun all you kin did
you tell em to send the doctor
  no i didnt tell them ive been hurt
dont you say a word about it either
dailey you see i do not stand in very well
with the old man-
  who wants to growled dailey a
man dont pet ground-rattlers
  -and if he thought there was any
chance of there being any real work to do
down here thatd bring any credit to a man
hed relieve me and send one of his own
pets down here
  johnson queried dailey who knew
both that officer and the colonel
  veryr likely beside that old man
theres another reason theres a girl at
the post who would worry a lot if she knew
ive been hurt
  there most generally is a girl some-
where said dailey looking at him with
kindly eyes
  so you see i only reported about the at-
tempt to steal the horses and the capture of
the thief and i will not peep about the
row see
  aye i see i wont open my head about
it to a soul lieutenant but i want to say
right here an now that we owe you some-
thin me an boaz an we generally manage
to pay our debt your friend the colonelll
swear to that before were through with him
i aint a-goin to thank you you done
your duty an a feller dont want thanks
fer doin that but-well maybe the dayll
come when j  be able to show you that me
an boaz aint the forgettin kind
  he swung on his pony and cantered olf
down the trail toward preciosa leaving
needham staring after him in the moonlight
v
needhams telegram discreetly
worded created no disturbance at
the post but colonel borden being
constitutionally unable to allow any one to
perform undisturbed the work to which he
had been assigned telegraphed reams of in-
structions as to the manner in which the
prisoner should be turned over to tlie
sheriff
  it is doubtful if any prisoner being trans-
ferred to the military fortress of peter and
paul was ever surrounded by such formali-
ties all of which instructions having been
duly received were read by needham with
an assiduity worthy of a better cause and
then were promptly cremated in the troop
lire
  no word having been received at the
post of his wound no one worried lea of
all may allardyce who got her daily letter
which was delivered by the orderly at the
house after her uncle had departed for the
office where he made the adjutant miser-
able for three hours ever- morning each
time she received a letter may went
through the regular formality of crossing
off the calendar one more day the
eighteenth was marked with a huge red m
for that day was if their plans did not mis-
carry to be literally a red-letter day
  i will not say a word to advise you she
wrote needham but will leave the making
of the plans to you it would seem ridicu-
lous if being ready and willing to trust my
entire future life in your hands i should
demur at any plans you make dedde on
what you think best to do and let me know
in time to make my arrangements
  but needham could do nothing until he
should get an answer to his night letter
to his uncle everytfiing hinged on that
so writing may to have patience he told
her that he could not properly plan until be
could get a reply to his request lor the four
months leave
it came one night when it was least ex-
pected when a trooper returning from
the salters

preciosa late at night rode up to his little
fire and handed needham the brown en-
velope that meant so much to him
  a telegram for the lieutenant sir
  needham thanked him and tore it open
a moment later the astonished men stared at
an apparently demented officer who danced
about the fire forgetful of his game leg
  good old uncle jim he muttered un-
folding the telegram and reading it again
and again as if to convince himself that it
was true
lt gerald needham th cav
    preciosa arizona
  four months leave granted you take effect
isth inst copy of order mailed your regimental
commander today	needham
  vhoo-oo-oop whos the man who
wants to do away with the united states
senate its the greatest body of law-
makers in the world oh what a letter ill
have to write to may tonight she wanted
detailed plans- shell get em now-and
wont the old man swear
  he got out paper and pencil and wrote
feverishly
   a telegram that t have just received tells me that
my leave is granted to begin on the eighteenth
-your birthday our wedding-day now
darling listen very carefully and i will tell you
what to do on the eighteenth you being twenty-
one years of age will be no longer under your uncles
control in any way tf i return to the post and we
arrange to marry there it is quite within the realms
of possibility that the old devil would order me off
the post and it may be you too
  pack a suitcase and leave the post unknown to
any one on the mail-stage that leaves the post-
clfice at the fort at eight-thirty the morning of
the eighteenth it reaches preciosa about noon
in time to put the mail-sacks on the noon train f-r
the east the train docs not stop here i will
meet you with a buckboard about two miles out on
the post road and we will get on the noon train
for the east at catlins crossing which is a flag
stop about three miles west of preciosa i will
write and get a license and have a minister on the
train and we will be married as soon as we get on
the car wc will send a telegram to your uncle
after it is all over so that he can rejoice with u
   be very sure to do exactly as i tell you because
the slightest change might spoil everything all
you have to do is to pack your suitcase and start
for preciosa on the stage on the morning of the
eighteenth i will attend to everything else
always excepting a condemned
criminal awaiting the day set for
his execution to no man does the
time pass so slowly as to the prospective
bridegroom it was even worse than usual
to needham who knew nothing of either
state patrolling always tiresome and
monotonous work grew doubly so to him
even dailey who met him frequently now
on his rides found him growing more and
more touchy
  what ails you he asked one day with
the direct frankness of the southwest
leg hurt you
  needham who had for days longed for
some one to whom he could speak threw
restraint to the winds
  no that isnt it im going to be mar-
ried dailev
  does the girl know it asked the inter-
ested mr dailey
  she does she is the niece of that old
devil up at the fort-
  dailey looked at him as one can imagine
the onlookers gazing at the leaders of a for-
lorn hope
  say son youve got the nerve she
aint like him i reckon-
  not much i dont know how hell
take it hell bust i reckon whats the
matter with you he asked suspiciously
for mr dailey was rocking to and fro in his
saddle as if suddenly taken ill
  oh nothin nothin only its some-
thin i was thinkin about an this here
just about puts the gilded mansard roof
on it we was plannin a little party fer the
ol devil up there an with this on top of
it-
  he rocked from side to side in renewed
laughter
  the old mans forbidden it said need-
ham so we re goin to run away--
  how where tell me all about it
needham told him and mr dailey
slapped his leg in unrestrained mirth
  thats all right son youre on an
heres where i kin help you i ll go over to
the county seat tomorrow an get the license
fer you an arrange to have a minister on
the noon train the day after tomorrow
you might have difficulty doin that on
account of you not knowin nobody but
ill go over tomorrow an attend to it ail fer

needham wrote it out upon a piece of
paper and handed it to dailey who thrust
it into his pocket	 
  i can count on you can i dailey
san you saved me an- boaz a good manv
hundred dollar you sure could count on
it just fer that but youre goin to salt lhc

dailey

boaz an to old john wilkes hes in the
game with me an boaz ill tell you about
it some time you see sou itll be such a
blamed good joke on the old colonel-
  joke on the colonel colonel borden
  mr dailey nodded his head
  you know hes about as popular about
here as a skunk is at a church social-never
mind that he called me my man once
before a gang of politicians an they call me
that all over the state now-ill show him
got any money needham
  needham about to take offense at the
words caught the tone and smiled
  oh i guess ive got enough much
obliged just the same
  i dont mean that i mean that me an
boas has got what we think is a good thing
-in copper it is it aint any prospect
where you pay a man fer diggin a hole an

no sir if youve got say three hundred
dollars-
  yes ive got that much
  well ill see boaz tomorrow or the next

fer themselves an then cut a water-melon
in dividends if theres anything in it
well let you in on the ground floor ill go
tomorrow an git that license fer you an

train the day after tomorrow adios
  he swung off down the trail and need-
ham glad at heart now that he had taken
the cow-puncher into his confidence rode
back to his camp
that afternoon johnson coming
down to relieve needham from the
command of the little detachment
needham turned over to him the various
orders that he had received from time to
time and gave him what information he
could johnson however was not very
receptive he knew loo much
  dailey and boazll hejp you all they
can said needham
  ah indeed mr johnson smiled bis
superiority so youve been consorting
with that crowd the colonel said he
thought you would why needham
theyre the worst outfit of robbers this
country has ever seen i cant see what you
see in them coarse common vulgar cow-
punchers colonel borden says-
  oh- what colonel borden says and
you too the one redeeming feature about
this place is that you dont have t-- listen
to him if youre here for a month johnson
youll have good chance to rest up and get
the taste of shoe-polish out of your mouth
whereat mr johnson had the grace to
lose his temper
   colonel borden however was not so well
satisfied as he might have been such an
important thing as transferring the com-
mand of a detachment of ten men from one
officer to another without his being present
to interfere was of doubtful propriety be-
side that there was just one chance in a
thousand that by dropping in on them
unexpectedly he might bridg to light some
dereliction of duty on the part of air need-
ham that would justify him in refusing to
permit him to take advantage of his leave
of absence which had been granted him
over the head of his colonel accordingly
he dropped a bomb in the midst of the
dinner-table as they sat at dinner on the
night of the seventeenth when be remarked
sourly-
   molly ill have to have my breakfast at
half-past three in the morning
   well all i have to say is that youll
probably have trouble in getting it ou
know very well that the cook does not get
here till six- and so forth con amore
even married man knows it
  can  or can  not have what i want
and pay for in my own house thundered
the colonel if you were to spend half
as much time in attending to your duties
as you spend in telling me how to run this
post-
  if i didnt run this house any better
than you run this post-
  may rose and pushing her chair back
from the table left the room her uncle
gazed after her triumphantly if he
the salters

thought for one moment which he did
rejoicing thereat mightily that she had
gone to her room to cry he was vastly mis-
taken she had gone to her room to pack
her suitcase and to put it where no prying
eye should find it as she went up the steps
she could not help hearing her uncles last
words he had testily opened the mail
that the orderly had brought him a long
stiff official envelope attracted his attention
and eying it eagerly he ripped it open with
liis dessert-knife two long blue checks
each for two hundred dollars fell out he
picked them up eagerly and then burst
forth
  see what it is to be a fool i sent my
pay accounts to the paymaster two weeks
ago and requested him to send me four hun-
dred dollars in small checks so that we could
have them cashed here as we needed them
no human being nearer than john wilkes
at preciosa can cash these checks i had
intended to go there in the morning any-
way and now this makes it imperative
weve got to have some cash ive got to
go early in the morning i want to get there
so that i can get out to the camp before
mr needham has a chance to leave if he
has not fully complied with all the regula-
tions by the eternal he shall not go on his
leave ill stop it
  how did he succeed in getting his leave
when you had disapproved it
  how by going over my head officially
and by invoking some sort of cheap political
aid when he gets back to this regiment
ill see that he gets a course of training
  i suppose his uncle helped him you
know he has an uncle who is a united
states senator what a pity it is colonel
that mr needham is so deep in your black
bocks if you had only liked him it is quite
within the realms of possibilities that you
might have got-oh well i do not suppose
you will ever be a brigadier-general if no
one ever has a chance to know your abilities
-if a colonel today wishes to retire-
 an uncle - a senator why-why
madam said the colonel with the most
elaborate politeness that finally gave way
under the strain just as a dam gives way
under pressure why in - madam
have you kept this from me
  i supposed of course you knew it and
that you-would not allow yourself to be
swerved by personal feelings where your
principles were involved i knew that
   
under no circumstances would you allow
him to use political aid to help you-
  may heard just this much in her aunts
voice before she fled to her own room where
she buried her face in her pillows to deaden
the shrieks of her laughter which she feared
would be heard below stairs it was simply
delicious beyond the power of words to de-
scribe how gerald her husband tomor-
row would enjoy it she blushed at the
thought and then came the knowledge that
there still remained a way by which she
could re-establish friendly relations with
her uncle should she ever desire to do so
the very knowledge too that she could do
so hurt her for it was not pleasant to see
such veniality even in a man for whom she
had long since lost all regard
  she finished packing her suitcase un-
dressed brushed her hair and after writing
a farewell note to her aunt crept into her
bed where she dropped oil to sleep smiling
happily
fffis colonel borden for his part
gsgsg spent a very pleasant evening in
making his wife as thoroughly miser-
able as only a man of his type can finally
announcing his intention to leave the post
at half-past three he went off to bed leav-
ing his wife in tears
  promptly at three-thirty appearing on
the scene with a bad temper and an attack
of indigestion and finding no breakfast he
stormed out upon the porch and threw him-
self into the waiting buckboard paying no
attention to the shrieked oh colonel
colonel wait a moment i ll come down
and get you a cup of coffee that floated
down to him from the second story like
most men in like case he imagined that
somehow he was inflicting an injury upon
his wife by going away without his break-
fast
  ill get some breakfast at old john
wilkess place ive got to get him to cash
my checks anyway  suppose hes got four
hundred dollars in his place big fool as he
is he ought to be able to cook a simple
breakfast for me i hope i catch that young
scoundrel needham in some dereliction of
duty id just like to show him what it
means to go over my head in official mat-
ters
  with which charitable wish colonel bor-
den solaced himself for several miles until
it occurred to him that he was missing a

adventure
chance to swear at the driver lor his bad
driving accordingly he devoted himself
to scathing comments on that functionary
till he saw him growing  isibiy red behind
the ears
  the morning was fresh and the road was
good if dusty so that in three hours he
found himself in sight of the little brown
settlement of preciosa
  go to john wilkess house driver i
want to get some breakfast
  now john wilkess house had four rooms
one was a general store one was a bar-
room one was called by courtesy an eating-
room and the fourth was mr wilkess own
private boudoir the kitchen was a small
adobe building detached from the house
mr wilkes stood in the doorway of the
store listening vaguely to a conversation
between messieurs dailey and boaz who
were in the bar which connected by a door
generally kept closed with the cating-room
  its all done said boaz proudly i
done it myself i couldnt trust no one
else i took the ol shotgun an i loaded
her up with about ten dollars per barrel
man its a shame to take the money i
acted on the hint that old john gave me-
what hints that
  why he told me that id better spread
some sackin in front of the rock sos to
catch the fumes of the powder when i shot
through it you see if the assayer was to
find sulfur in his assay hed git suspi-
cious 
  mr dailey gazed long and admiringly at
mr wilkess back
  now who would have thought of that
but old john he demanded a good
pirate was lost in john how much ore is
there on that dump mike
  welt sir i fired about ten shots i think
at the dump itself if  lifted one pound of
rock there i lifted five hundred i didnt
put it all in one shot i scattered it didnt
you hear the shoot in
  sure i did but  thought you was
shootin at quail
  quail nothin  lifted all the top rock
off so i could get at the bottom layers an
i put the same stones back where they come
from so that the moss was slill on top
every time i placed a new layer i plugged
it with a shot an then i mixed in a lot of old
lookin shale with the pile so it would look
like it had never been bothered none
  the slurring of buckboard wheels in the
foot-deep dust of the roadway drew both
men to the door colonel borden dis-
mounted waving to mr wilkes in the door-
way
for the edification of th< >se who do
not know what salting is as prac-
tised in the busy marts of the west
it may be explained that mr boaz had been
employed that morning in preparing a gold-
mine for sale by the simple method of
salting it
  now there are two methods of salting a
mine if it is a placer mine which is a mine
in or near a water-course where the gold-
bearing gravel is simply washed out in the
water salting consists in simply scattering
some gold-dust and then allowing the vic-
tim to dig it out and pan it
  the method of salting a quartz mine is
diilerent requiring at times an erpert in
salting a quartz mine the gold must be
made to adhere to the quartz in the dig-
gings and in the loose rock on the core-
dump this is done by the simple means
of loading the gold-dust into a shotgc 
and shooting it up against the rock it
must be done from the right distance and
in just the right quantity too little
would not induce one to buy too much
would make the would-be purchaser suspi-
cious care must also be taken that the
gold is the same quality tliat comes from
that district this was the work on which
mr boaz had been employed that morning
  lets get our business done urn of all
mr wilkes i will appreciate it if you
can do me a favor-ah i knew you would
if you could yes-im in a-ah-ah a sort
of an embarrassing situation i sent my
pay accounts to the paymaster with the re-
quest tliat he send me a lot of small checks
so that i could use them to pay bills with
he paid no attention to my request but like
the fool he is sent me two checks for two
hundred dollars each can you cash them
for me mr wilkes
  mr wilkes went to the little iron safe
that stood in the corner and after pawing
the combination for five minutes got the
door open and announced that he could sup-
ply cash for the checks he proceeded to
count out the cash in dirty greasy bills by
the aid of sundry lickings of the tongue
more or less audible
  now for breakfast eggs mr wilkes
if youve got any fresh and some nice
the salters

crisp toast and a cup of coffee with a
few slices of well-browned bacon i like a
simple breakfast please hurry my man
holy cats i wonder what he eats when
hes hungry look at john hes a-havin
a fit
  mr wilkes w-as struggling manfully
against evident resentment
  i kin give you coffee he said slowly
an bread but i aint saw a egg since
easter i aint got no bacon but i can give
you corned beef
  call this a hotel snapped the colonel
i aint called it nothin barked back
mr wilkes fiercely an id advise you not
to neither i aint no soldier you caint
talk loose to me cause i wont take it an
you aint wuth it if you want what i got
you kin buy it if you dont like it you kin
go hungry
 well-well my man-
  an i aint your man neither ner no-
body elses man but john wilkes
snapped the old man angry now in earnest
  i didnt mean any offense-you know
how a hungry man feels mr wilkes said
the colonel who saw the chance of a break-
fast rapidly disappearing give me what
you can and for heavens sake hurry it up
will you mr wilkes
  no and i wont hurry it up none neither
ill take my own time to it an them as
dont like it kin go further grumbled mr
wilkes retreating into the kitchen where
his voice could be heard as he talked
querulously to himself
  oh mr wilkes the colonels voice
too had growtn snappy and irritated
theres some one in the bar i think see
who it is please it may be some one to see
me who is in there
  his quick ear had caught the sound of
moving feet as the two men in the barroom
shifted their positions
  say somethin growled boaz say
somethin an say it quick to make him
think we didnt know he wras in there
vi
the door between the rooms was
closed and colonel borden had no
more idea than any person has of
the carrying properties of his own voice
the fact that he heard the voices of the men
in the next room should have lold him that
his own was audible
  an i says to him- the voice carried
well through the closed door- i cant tell
you nothin i says till i see boaz you
remember that you was away i wrant to
let you in on the ground floor i says be-
cause you helped us save them cattle that
the greasers was tryin to run off well
when i said that needham he up an says
 how much will it cost me to come in on
tliis ground floor along with you an boaz
i aint got much ready cash he says
but i kin put up a matter of three or four
hundred dollars its mighty good of you
dailey he says again an i only wish i had
more money to put in it
  of course i told him that we was anxious
to git the cash in right away so we kin buy
the claim up at once he listened to me
right good an then he says that when he
comes back from leave hell be married then
an hell have a lot o money to invest it
sure is funny mike to listen to these yere
people who gets married believin that two
can live as cheap as one marryin on the
pay of a lieutenant he wont never have
two quarters to jingle on a tombstone
  a long silence reigned in the eating-room
if the colonel could have looked through the
closed door he might have seen mr dailey
leaning over the bar his left eye contem-
platively closed as he w atched his partner
who was grinning foolishly presently
dailey hearing colonel bordens chair
scrape across the rough floor began in a
slightly higher key
  o course mike just between us it is a
good thing its the best thing that ive
seen in twenty years out here in arizona-
old wilkes himself dont know how good
it is if he had any notion of it hed never
have been willin to sell fer nine hundred
hes so darned lazy that he aint been near
the claim fer a month an durin all that
time the greaser that he hired to work the
claim fer him has been haulin the ore
away an sellin it if old john knowed
what that ore-dump shows right now hed
have heart failure to tell you the truth
i aint so blamed anxious to let young need-
ham in on this of course we owe him some-
thin fer havin helped us out with them
raiders but id a heap ruthcr have a re-
sponsible man in with us on this its most
too big a thing to fool with when were
done wte ought to clean up fifteen thousand
dollars easy
  but you told needham youd let him in
 
adventure
on this here thing said boaz oomplain-
ingly
  so  did but he says right out that he
cant very well spare the cash right now
he wants us to hold oil ivr four months
we cant do that why old johu is likely
to lind out about this at any moment an
when he does its good-by to any chance of
gettin any gold otfen that claim
  the chair in the next room scraped back
still further and they heard the colonel rise
and come to the door mr dailey snick-
ered openly
  gentlemen- the colonel opened the
door and walked in-  hope you will
pardon me i could not help hearing a
part of your conversation ah mr dailey
bow do you do well i hope and this is
mr boaz too-i am very glad indeed to see
you gentlemen
  to save his life the colonel could not keep
the patronizing note out of his voice
  i understand gentlemen that my
young officer mr needham has been so
fortunate as to have been of some assistance
to you in saving your stock thats what
were here for gentlemen you know to
help you gentlemen all we can our army
is a public tool you know always to be used
to help the people
  mr dailey and mr boaz shuffled their
feet embarassedly along the floor had
colonel borden been looking indeed he
might have seen mr daileys left eyelid
flutter a moment and lie still he had
heard the colonel before on the propriety
of having the post garrison split up to
guard the border
  mr needham is one of my best young
officers went on the colonel i did not
mean to play the eavesdropper but-er-
er-i could not help overhearing a part of
your talk it is very good of you two gen-
tlemen to plan to help the young man
financially i suppose he needs it most
young men do he is to go away today on
leave of absence for four months quite a
long leave and i-ah-may say that it took
a deal of work on my part to get it for him
  indeed  can hardly spare him as it is
but  am delaying you gentlemen what
i wanted to say is this from what part of
your talk i could not well help overhearing
i understand that it is your intention to let
mr needham in on what you call a good
thing financiallybut that he has not got the
ready money to invest at present on the
ground floor so to speak to use	of
those incomparably humorous idioms of the
southwest
  he winked ponderously intending mes-
sieurs dailey and boaz to appreciate his
quickness of perception as well as his busi-
ness acumen
  of course mr needham hasnt got the
money youngsters rarely have now if
you gentlemen really wish to do him a good
turn if you will show me that this project
is really a good thing i can in pul the three
hundred dollars that you need and when lhe
time comes transfer the claim or whatever
it is to mr needham when he is in a posi-
tion to take it
  thats square of you colonel mighty
square sir daileys voice boomed big
with appreciation but its so small a
tiling that it wouldnt be even interestin to
a gentleman of your means you wouldnt
want to touch it
  to colonel borden strong in the knowl-
edge that on the very day his guardianship
of his pretty nieces fortune ceased and thit
legally the management of her fortune h i
already passed out of his hands the fifteen
thousand dollars that he had heard men-
tioned a short time before did not sound
small all numbers are purely relative
  not for myself no you are right of
course personally i should not think of
making a small investment like this i
merely mention it because i thought per-
haps you might like me to take the matter
up for mr needham it is of no conse-
quence
  oh i see mr dailey became sud-
denly convinced if we show you the
place an you decide that its a good thing
an decide to go in fer needham then youll
transfer it to him if he wants it
  certainly thats the understanding
  it aint hardly necessary to put that in
writing i suppose with most people it
would be but of course no army officer
would sting another
  sir the colonel looked properly in-
dignant
  oh pshaw colonel dailey didnt mean
nothin heres what weve got broke in
boaz
  he glanced around the room furtively a
he spoke
  it aint necessary fer old john to hear u
talkin if he knowed what we know he
wouldnt sell that claim o liisn at any price-
the salters

come on outside colonel where nobody can
hear us
they passed outside the door
once arrived at the back of the
house mr dailey produced some
samples of ore from a capacious pocket and
passed them to the colonel
  old john took up a claim seven years
ago away up the canon here up by willow
water it is you know it its about three
miles up the creek well you know hes
gettin old an hes gettin lazy an instead
of doin his own work on the claim hes been
hirin a greaser to work it fer him at
first it didnt pay he was workin it fer
near six years before he got color enough to
make him keep on
  then it pinched out on him but he
wouldnt quit every cent that he makes
offen the store hes been payin that greaser
to work the claim fer him about a month
ago we began to have suspicions that all
wasnt right we got on the trail of that
greaser an found he was gettin drunk
every saturday night in nogales an then
we trailed him home an discovered that he
was haulin the ore away from the dump on
the claim by the burro load an was sellin
it right in nogales fer eight dollars a load
you kin figure out how much the ore was
runnin to the ton
  dailey who had begun to believe his
own story was obviously excited and boaz
was puffing at liis cheap cigar till it threat-
ened to burst into a blaze
  well sir as i say we trailed him an
found out what he was doin all that ore
come from john wilkess ore-dump an old
john never knowed it it aint no sin to
keep quiet somethin beside that that old
devij stuck me bad on a horse last year
hed eat loco-weed an he like to killed me
  it turned out that he hadnt been near
the claim fer a year to my certain knowledge
so when we offered to buy the claim he
jumped at the chance he wanted nine
hundred he asked three thousand at first
but we let him beat hisself down to nine
hundred ive got here three hundred of
mine an three hundred of boazs an we
was lookin fer needham to put in his so
we can close up the bargain we was
anxious to close up the tiling on account of
worth down in nogales gettin on to the
thing in- kind of a way if you want to
come in sir you kin but its on the under-
standin that youre doin it fer needham
itll cost you three hundred dollars cash
down
  can i see the claim and the ore-dump-
asked colonel borden quietly underneath
that tone he was fairly quivering with ex-
citement he had known several officers in
times past who had been let in on the
ground floors of good things realize largely
from the investments that had been made
on just such pointers given by these ster-
ling rough pioneers whatever he might
make it was not a matter of doubt in his
own mind that mr needham would not be
entitled to any of it he would be investing
his own money not that of needham
  of course you can see the thing we
dont want you to buy a pig in a poke got
an hour or two to spare
  the colonel consulted his watch
  i am in your hands gentlemen until
eleven oclock
  come on then if you an boazll walk
on up the trail fer a bit   sneak around to
the stables an git my buckboard without
lettin old john see us we kin drive up
there in a half-hour ill just take a look to
see that of john dont suspicion nothin
ready sir
  my breakfast gasped the colonel
  he strode back into the eating-room
where he found mr wilkes slapping down
sundry evil-looking dishes upon a none
too clean table
  its ready come an git it was his an-
nouncement made sourly
  the colonel sat down and fairly gobbled
at the most unappetizing meal that he had
ever tried to eat mr wilkes had excelled
himself
ten minutes jater the colonel
joined mr boaz in front of the
house and they walked slowly down
the trail carefully observed by mr wilkes
who standing with a curtain grasped in
each hand fairly shook with homeric
laughter
  a heavy-handed slap upon the shoulder
nearly threw him off his feet end he turned
to face dailey
  now john get a move on you he said
quickly get that muzzle-loadin shotgun
of yourn an load it up with black powder
an this-
  he handed him a small glass bottle that
was half filled with gold-dust and gravel
-
adventure
  boaz has salted the dump but he told
me that he clean forgot to salt the vein in-
side the shaft if the old man examines the
dump an sees gold an then looks at the
veins inside in the shaft entrance an dont
see no sign of gold hell call off an spot the
game slip up there just as quick an as
quiet as you kin and lire a shot at the
headin everything is all fixed up there
for it
  boaz left his screen all fixed in front of
the tunnel just as it should be to fix the veins
its made o old sugar sackin an all youve
got to do is to get up there right quick an
lire a shot tlirough the screen an then get
out as fast as you can youll have to
hurry up though ill hold em back as
long as i can after youve fired the shot
sneak right up the hill as fast as you can an
then come down again an say you was after
quail  use your pony youll have no
time to get there walkin
  mr wilkes nodded comprehendingly
took the shotgun from the corner poured a
generous charge of black powder down each
yawning barrel rammed a half a newspaper
in on top of each charge decanted carefully
the gold-dust on top of that rammed that
home with wet cotton atop and hastily cap-
ping the piece made for the back door
  man but im workin hard these days
he said complainingly i aint doin it fer
money mind he called back over his
shoulder you didnt hear what he called
my hotel today did you
  nobodys doin it fer money said
dailey scornfully whod salt a mine fer
three hundred dollars im doin it to fix
him hes so derned high an mighty with
his know-it-all airs callin his betters my
man after you sting him good once hell
quit talkin about knowin so much about
mines hell move east im thinkin after
this when it s all done well have to make
a big fuss about it somehow or other an then
give him back his coin after hes made a
fool of hissclf hurry up john  cant
wait no longer youll have to crowd your
hoss as it is to get there
  he stood for a moment watching mr
wilkes scrambling up the loose shale of the
hillside as fast as his old legs could carry
him on his way to liis stable and then
climbing into liis dingy rattle-trap of a
buckboard dailey drove slowly up the trail
to where colonel borden and mr boaz
stood awaiting him
 st
  it aint very far he said as they
arted oft so we can take our time
i have not much time to spare said the
colonel presently i have to go over to
inspect mr needhams camp before noon
let your horses out mr dailey
  under his cunstant urging dailey let the
eager ponies so faster than he intended
he could not refuse point-blank to hasten
but he made ever possible effort to delay
progress in order to give mr wilkes all the
time he could first he dropped his whip
then that proving unavailing he adroitly
kicked into the dusty trail the desert
water-bag without which no man travels
in the southwest no sound of any shot
coming to his listening ears he became
despondent finally colonel borden un-
able to restrain himself longer laid a heavy-
hand upon the reins
  oh go on dailey you drive like an
apple-woman let the ponies go well
never get there
  were there now said boaz as a jerk
of the buckboard nearly threw him out  f
the wagon theres the entry
  he pointed to a yawning black mouth
that gaped at them from the hillside three
hundred feet up in air a great pile of ore
lay on the dump just outside the mouth of
the tunnel and in front of the entrance ex-
actly as a shade stands before a fireplace
he noticed with concern a great screen made
of old sugar sacking it was about four
feet square and nearly obscured the mouth
of the entrance it was through this very
screen that he had salted the ore-dump
itself earlier in the day
  one moment colonel dailey was
sparring for time though be well knew that
time could not avail them now fair
plays a jewel its only right for you to
deposit with us your three hundred dollars
before you go up there you turn over your
money to me or boaz an then well take
you up to see that claim if you like it you
own one-third of it if you dont like it
well turn the money straight back to yu
you givin us a promise in v ritin not to say
a word about the matter till we give you
leave aint that right mike
  sounds all right you see colonel you
aint runnin no risk if you like it it s
yourn it you dont like it its oum an we
have your promise not to tell anybody else
about it we got to protect ourselves
shell out sir
the salters

  colonel borden glared at them puffed
sterlorously for a moment and finally pro-
ducing a plethoric pocket-book counted out
the money with a hand that trembled with
eagerness
  now well go up there said dailey
springing out of the buckboard
  one moment gentlemen by this last
act you have stripped this deal of any per-
sonal feelings that might have entered into
it and have made it simply a cold business
deal i prefer to examine that claim by
myself if you have no objection if you
gentlemen will kindly await me here i will
run on up there i flatter myself that it
will not take me long i am a bit of a con-
noisseur in mines and minerals i will
hurry all i can
t with a darkening brow mr
      dailey watched the stout figure
   climb slowly up the slope at that
rate of speed it would take him a long time
to reach the tunnel
  itll be all up with us now if he goes in-
side if he sticks to the dump he may bite
yet but if he goes inside an once sees that
the veins aint even the same kind of rock
that the ore-dump carries well be out
twenty dollars worth of gold-dust thats
all confound old john hes as slow as
cold molasses runnin up a fence in winter
hes spoiled the best joke we ever planned
in arizona- look there he goes now
its all spoiled
  very slowly they saw colonel borden
climb up the shaley slope that scaled oil
under his feet falling in a thunderous rattle
to the lower slope they saw him grasp an
overhanging bush and draw himself to the
lip of the bank and then pass to the ore-
dump over which he bent curiously once
or twice they saw him take a piece of rock
from the pile scrape it weigh it in each
hand smell and taste it and finally drop it
into his coat pocket he finished with the
ore-dump and passed to the screen of torn
sacking which he carefully examined from
front and rear finally he stepped back
again to the dump took a great piece of ore-
bearing rock in his hand and coming back
to the entrance passed behind the screen
then-
  land o goshen said mr boaz fer-
vently look yonder will you there
comes that old fool john wilkes see him
cornin down the hill too late o course
  who-who dailey gaped in every
direction except the right one indicated by
boazs stabbing forefinger
  wilkes-john-the old fool hes right
above the entry goin down toward it
see him
  dailey stared sure enough they saw
against the hillside the figure of old gray-
haired mr wilkes bare-headed clutch-
ing his gun to his breast with both hands
hastening down the slope of the hill just
above the tunnel he had tied his pony to a
bush higher up on the crest among the
rocks
  stop him yell to him mike your
voicell carry furthern mine tell him to
come back or to get back up the hill before
the old man sees him y-o-u john-get
back i say
  mr wilkes intent upon his work as all
good workmen should be did not hear the
shout but colonel borden did he thrust
his head out for one moment waved a
reassuring hand and once more disappeared
behind the torn screen ten seconds later
mr wilkes sliding down most of the way
upon his haunches made the last ten urds
of his descent climbed to his feet and the
startled men in the buckboard saw him
drop to one knee raise his gun and fire
straight through the screen of sacking
 good-
  boaz never finished the sentence the
roar of the double explosion-for john had
fired both barrels-echoed in thunder from
wall to wall of the narrow valley and was
followed long before it died away by a series
of ear-splitting shrieks that would have
made a white mountain apache turn green
with envy
  they stood appalled and saw presently
when the smoke pall had blown aside old
john wilkes his gun sinking from his
nerveless hand half sink half totter to the
ground they could see his old knees
trembling
  two seconds later the figure of colonel
borden tottered from behindthe screen
he was roaring like a bull and both hands
were clasped firmly over his two hip-
pockets
  good lord john has plugged the
colonel look at him run
  they saw for one moment as in a ha-e
old john wilkes standing staring at the
apparition the next moment he had
dropped his gun and sped straight up the

adventure
hill with the speed of an antelope and had
disappeared in the scrub toward his pony
vii
the two men hardly waiting to tie
the ponies sped quickly up the
slope only to lind the colonel gasp-
ing upon the ore-dump he was evidently
not seriously injured
  good heavens colonel- began
dailey
   kill him for this-ill have his
hearts blood that old devil sneaked up
behind me gentlemen i have you for wit-
nesses-he shot me from behind he fol-
lowed me all the way from his accursed
hotel and shot me just because i didnt like
the way he cooked-
  he thoughtlessly sat down upon a rock
and sprang up swearing
  both barrels as i live great gosh
colonel mr dailey was helpless with
laughter wherere you hit colonel
  colonel borden glared at him and
started to shake his fist in his face the
necessity of using both hands prevented
him
  youre a pair of - robbers he
gritted between his teeth wheres my
money wheres my three hundred dol-
lars
  boaz made shift to place it in the blood-
stained hip-pocket hardly able to find the
pocket through laughter lie at last shoved
the roll in and roared again to see the
colonel wince it was probably the first
time in his life that the acquisition of money
had caused him physical pain he had
experienced it on several occasions when
he had lost it
  shoot him in the coat an vest the
pants is mine cackled mr boaz feebly
waving his hands in front of his face there
couldnt have been no shot in it colonel or
hed have killed you at that distance
  there couldnt have been hey the
irate colonel was rapidly passing his hands
over his person look here will you
both pockets are filled with blood my
heavens do something quick to help me
are you going to let me die unaided
  whats that stickin to your pants
colonel
  dailey bent forward and touched him
with a prodding finger the colonel
winced
  as sure as im a livin man its-gold
the lat word was a shriek its gold
gentlemen i see it all now i dont jiu ti
be suspicious but i swear  believe now that
we know the real reason why john wilkes
was willin to let us pay him nine hundred
dollars fer this claim as sure as a gun is
iron that old devil has been saltin this
dump on us and he came mighty near gettin
us too if it hadnt been fer the colonel
hre-yes sirs thats just what he was
doin i wouldnt have believed that of old
john he sure come up here to salt that
claim to fool us an he salted-
  he - he - he - salted echoed mr
boaz
  the colonel they shrieked in unison
falling up against each other in helpless
laughter while the astonished colonel who
had been surreptitiously examining his
wounds stood clutching his trousers in both
hands glaring at them
  together they got him to the buckboard
but it was a half hour before they started
homeward the ponies walking the colon
standing erect one hand grasping firmh
the back of the front seat with the other
holding the clothing away from the delicate
parts of his person emitting evry few mo-
ments groans and curses as the buckboard
hit the ruts and stones in the road
  dailey and boaz had openly cast aside
restraint
  my lord but youre lucky colonel
when vou git yourself minted-
  he-he-he cackled mr boaz he kin
issue gold certificates now on hisself-
gentlemen roared the now angry
colonel this unseemly levity shall-must
stop you hear me stop it instantly
whereat the two men burst into renewed
laughter
  who is that cornin up the road mike
it looks like a soldier
it was a rider spurring a tired and
sweating horse up the canon trail
and when he drew nearer they saw
that it was a trooper from the  ort and that
he had been riding hard he reined in hii
sweating horse and dismounting handed a
letter to the colonel
  sir mrs borden said i was not to halt
my horse till i gave you this
   letting go his hold on his trousers which
settled to his knees the colonel put on his
glasses and tore open the letter it was a
the salters

mere hasty scrawl but it made him grasp
hastily at his clothing in his haste to do
something it was a nervous scribble and
it read
   i have just found a note from may saying that
she has run away to marry mr needham for
heavens sake stop them at preciosa ll thej are
to be married have her married here and spare us
the gossip
  go on roared the colonel get to
the railroad station as quick as you can i
must catch the noon train wtiat time is it
due there
  she tasses preciosa at  but she
dont stop she just picks up the mail-sacks
on the fly
  it must stop-it shall stop i ll flag it
oh all right but im bettin even
money she wont stop she wont even
stop fer a cow on the track
  well for heavens sake get there and
stop talking i must catch it if it slows
up enough to pick up mail i can jump on it
where does she stop
  catlins crossin is the first stop to the
west of here shes past there now hold
on everybody im goin to the station
dailey would not have missed that last
half-hour with the colonel for the world
  banging from rut to rut rocketing
from stone to stone the old buckboard
swung down the trail the colonel hutching
his garments closer and closer to him eying
the nearing line of the railroad with the
stern gaze of a conqueror boaz clutching
fast at whatever came first within his reach
as the wagon swayed from side to side like
a log in a tidc-rip muttered grimly
  hes shore got faith in his maker-of
buckboards look out here we are-
  the ponies sat back on their haunches 
the dust as the buckboard stopped and
colonel borden still wildly clutching his
fast escaping garments was flung forward
over the front seat in a grotesque bow to
the gray head of mr wilkes which all un-
seen thrust itself around the corner of the
station mr wilkes promptly withdrew
  three minutes to spare  there she
comes-
a plume of black smoke showed
to the west of the curve and a deep
steady hum from the approaching
train ciyne down the wind to them
  dailey had done his work well the day
before with the license in his pocket he
had sought out needham and assured him
that there would be no hitch in his plans
whereupon mr needham had promptly
borrowed a buckboard from the dailey
ranch and driving two miles out upon the
post road awaited the arrival of the mail-
stage
  may had had no trouble whatever in
carrying out her part of the plan her
uncles early departure from the fort had
made all easy she waited till her aunt
was busy in her own room when she took
her suit-case and walking to the post-office
climbed into the waiting stage simply an-
nouncing that she desired to go to pre-
ciosa
  two miles out she found needham await-
ing the arrival of the mail and it was with
wildly beating heart that she climbed out
and held up a pretty flushed face for him
to kiss
  a half-hour later the red flag at catlins
crossing bade the roaring train slacken and
they were helped aboard by an obsequious
porter who ushered them into the observa-
tion car where they were greeted by a smil-
ing clergyman who rose to meet them
  mr needham
  gerald bowed
  this is most irregular as of course you
know but i am willing to earn out the
request of mr dailey our mutual fricncl
have you your license
  gerald produced it
  when do you desire the ceremony per-
formed
  at once if you please the conductor
i have no doubt will act as a witness
are you ready sweetheart
  may allardyce blushing like the rosy-
fingered dawn came out upon the observa-
tion platform just as they noticed a per-
ceptible slackening in the speed of the train
  shes slowin up to pick up the treeiosa
mail suh said the grinning porter 
  the clergyman opened his prayer-book
and began the service
  dearly beloved we are gathered to-
gether-
  they heard a yell from the station plat-
form as ihe car shot past the station they
saw a wildly moving figure dart out from
the building both hands clutching w ildly at
his trousers they heard a shrill shout
somebody stop him hcll make it
vit

adventure
  what they had not seen was colonel bor-
den as he prepared for the rush i hat was to
land him on the car where he would try to
prevent this elopement he forgot that he
no lunger had authority he saw the train
slacken its speed as it rounded the curve and
he darted forward just as the gray-bearded
mr wilkes shot around the corner of the
building and seized a coiled lariat from the
saddle of a sleeping cow-pony
  ill ketch him by the off hock he
shrilled as he swung the loop
  it left his hand opening and closing with
a vicious snap and it settled about the right
foot of the fleeing colonel borden
  the next moment the pony bracing him-
self for the shock the onlookers were dimly
aware through a great cloud of dust of a
prostrate figure on the cinder platform of
a struggling pony sitting back on its
haunches of two figures standing very
	lose together on the rear platform of the
rapidly moving train with the tall black-
garbed figure of a clergyman standing be-
hind them swaying to the swing and toss of
the trucks
  in an instant a sharp knife had fallen
on the taut lariat and mr wilkes dashed
around the corner of the station and run-
ning like a deer sought the seclusion of his
ow n home
  two perfect strangers picked the colonel
up brushed him down and pinned up hib
more obvious rents it was then that
dailey came up to him boaz had disap-
peared with wilkes and was not to be seen
  ive lost everything except my three
hundred dollars that  started in to get
today he said when he had exhausted his
stock of profanity ive lost everything
dailey except that accursed claim and im
not sureof that i wonder if that old wilkes
did actually salt it on us do you suppose
theres anything in that claim dailey i
suppose im lucky to have saved my three
hundred dollars
  well colonel quoth the cow-puncher
thoughtfully you know the old miner s
sayin gold is where you find it my ad-
vice is when youve got a place that you
know contains gold even if theres only a
small amount of it dont say anything to
anybody about it just set right down
on it
  and colonel borden waiting for the
buckboard to take him back to the post
reached behind him for an empty canta-
loup box and-sat down
   the camp-fire
a wehtlngflachjrheadershlters and adventurers
  rederick william wallace
is an old-time member of the camp-
fire and well known to most of us through
his stories yet he has told us only stray bits
about himself some four yiars ago he sent
me for you of the camp-fire an outline of
his life but always there has been some-
thing else to say about him or to hear from
him when one of his stories appeared
  now however wrell have it since the
following was written he has taken a num-
ber of trips with the banks fishermen and a
year or two ago became editor of the cana-
dian fisherman he has given me a still
fuller detailed account of his seafaring ex-
periences and some day we shall have them
too
  for the life of me i cant scare up anything ex-
citing enough in my own life to calj adventurous i
have roughed it at sea and ar--und the ports but
these art- merely incidentals
  was bom t went-five years ago near glasgow

sides father was a shipmaster sail and steam alfo
several uncles and cousins one uncle captain

tjtave knocked about since seventeen years of
age and have traversed the briny in square-
riggers spanish iron-orc boats norwegian coal-
t ramps atlantic and south american cattle-ships
liners and freighters and am familiar with almost
every craft that floats besides being a student of
marine history and author of several articles upon
old-time shipping have had my hands in the
tar-pot as they say at sea and can turn to with
any sailor at hand reef or steer
  have for the love of the thing and local color
beach-combed around most european and american
ports hanging around wharves ships and living in
sailors boarding-houses have also hauled trawls
with the banks fishermen and worked with them on
cape sable roseway and la have only last
month when driving for home from off la have
bank to digby n s we ran out of water and for
two days we had nothing to drink but a suck at
some chopped ice taken from off the fish in the hold
in the opinion of the gang it took more nerve to eat
that slimy ice than to die of thirst
dy the bye i recollect a close shave we had
once i was on a big cargo-steamcr bound
around lands end to london england it was a
dark foggy night and the vessel was in the vicinity
of the wolf rock-we could hear the horn it was
end of first watch midnight and firemen were draw-
ing fires when steam went down engineers drew it
off from steam steering-gear the wolf rock light-
house could be seen dead ahead and when the
quartermaster tried to pull the wheel to port it re-
fused to budge-no steam mate and man strug-
gled at the wheel but could not move it steamer
in the meantime ploughing straight for the rock
when in almost hair-raising proximity steam was
turned into the gear again and we swung clear
missed an iceberg once on the banks of newfound-
land in about as narrow a shave
t can think of nothing else except the usual
hazards one bucks against at sea where if you
lose your grip on a rope or jackstay you go plump
into eternity never was a passenger on a voyage-
always worked and enjoyed it if i sailed with my
father i had to work harder than ever he was
trained in bluenose and down-east windjam-
mers and still retained the characteristics peculiar
to these craft have taken a great delight in rough-
ing it always glad to get away from boiled shirts
collar and tie hate society especially literary
high-brows and prefer to swap pipes and yams
in the odoriferous gloom of a focsle with a crowd of
sh-backs and with the heave of open water undi-r
your feet on a fishing schooner i slept in my
dollies for throe weeks on end and never washed or
shaved for a month-they arc the only craft i have
been on where t hey do that in other vessels even
coal-boats you can undress and keep yourself clean
but in fishermen it is impossible
  ffxcuse this verbose and rather rambling ac-
count i am sorry that i can not scare up any-
thing really exciting but if the foregoing is any use
to you you ire welcome to use it in addition to
writing ea-ction am a marine artist--probably
the best known in canada have written hundreds
of special and technical artides and have even per-

it bore one was german the two others aus-

  having an idea that some of my friends may be
seeking my whereabouts through the medium ot

expect will find me for some time to come so that if
any letters arrive for me addressed to your care you
will perhaps kindly redirect them i wrote you last
from honolulu i tiiink after leaving those delight-
ful islands i sailed south to australia visiting sa-
moas etc en route
      the outbreak of hostilities i joined the
forces being raided in sydney and was selected
to go to the tropics in a special naval and military
expeditionary force of men who had seen previous
active service after being in various places in
new guinea and the bismarck archipelago we
arrived here in rabaul new britain neu pom-
mcm rabaul is the capital of german new
guinea which embraced all the islands around h re
it is a very pretty place and the tropical scenery
surrounding it is beautiful as all such scenery always
is the natives around the coast are quiet and very
well behaved but those a few miles in the interior
are savage cannibals to whom human life is value-
less and human flesh a great delicacy new britain
like the larger island of new guinea has never been
explored and offers a splendid gdd for some enter-
prising individual with aspirations in that direction
  you must excuse my not referring in any way to
the military situation here that is strictly taboo
for obvious reasons i have not seen a copy of your
valuable magazine for a long time now but hope to
procure some of liic back numbers in svdney later
on-c 
back numbers-and thanks
	hat what is practically an all-fiction
magazine should be so valued by its
readers that its back issues are carefully
treasured is a sincere and very practical
compliment to that magazine and -jtvir-
ture is duly proud that it is thus valued
that so many of our readers should keep 
complete file of all the back adventures a
considerable number even having them

adventure
bound in permanent form that the demand
for back copies should have exhausted
practically all of the supply that this de-
mand is so strong that we have to use form
letters for reply and to publish this state-
ment covering the situation-in short well
it certainly makes me feel good that adven-
ture has won so firm a place in the regard
and affection of its readers it is rather a
unique accomplishment for an all-fiction
magazine
while im at it ill also voice my ap-
preciation of the surprisingly large
proportion of you who have read the maga-
zine from its very first issue or who began
one two three or four years ago and have
never missed a month since some day
too ill print some of the letters showing
how much adventure readers will do or give
to get a copy of the magazine where
magazines are hard to get
  now as to the back issues still in stock
to issues of adventure for  
 and  can be supplied with
the exception that we have  copies of
june  and  of september  of
the  issues of   and  there
are only  of which we have enough copies
for our own office files incidentally we
have no bound volumes for sale but we can
furnish our readers free of charge with a
limited number of printed indexes for all
volumes  issues to a volume beginning
with vol iv may to october 
  for  we have about  copies of each
month which can be secured for the regular
price  cents each
  for  the current year we can at
present supply a reasonable number of back
copies though two or three months are
already beginning to run low
at this writing there are we find after
a careful raking over of the whole build-
ing some  extra copies of june  con-
taining one of dr cochranes dan wheeler
stories a drop of doom they may be
gone by the time this reaches your eye of
june  containing the crimson
chamber by the same author there is now
a supply of extra copies but it is fast
diminishing there are no extra copies of
any of his other stories as yet these stories
have not appeared in book form but they
may later
cjome of you have told rne it is next
 to impossible to find an old copy of
adventure on the second-hand book stalk
since they art so hard to secure from either
them or us ihe only other chance of getting
a few seems to be among yourselves if
any one of you has any considerable num-
ber of back copies an incomplete srt he can
not fill out or random issues which he can
no longer find place for or wishes to dispose
of let him send us his nameaddress a list
of t he exact issues in his possession and the
price he wants for them whenever we can
find room well publish these items and those
of you who wish can write direct to the
owner
when a new writer joins us it is the
custom that he shall stand up in his
place and tell his fellow members of our
camp-fire who he is and what hes done
m s wightman with a story of the
philippines in this number follows custom
   to begin with i am a southerner having been
born in south carolina when the seventies were ap-
proaching the eighties in the eighteen hundreds and
having spent my boyhood and early youth in that
state
   fiowever i must early have been bitten by the
wanderlust bug for in the late nineties having lost
both my mother and my father and being free to
roam as far as comparatively empty pockets would
carry me i trekked to chicago in search of adven-
ture and a living  found the adventure grinding
out the living
tn the fall of  i entered princeton and
was graduated with the ckts of  having
been an editor of that staid old exponent of classi-
cism the nassau lit following this i spent a year
up on the delaware tutoring a couple of scions of
wealth a year in und about new york and then
made up my mind to go to the philippines as the
most likely method of gratifying my desire to see
the world before settling down in any particular part
of it
oaveng taken the precaution of securing a
government position i went out in the autumn
of  possessed of a very hazy idea of what our
overseas provinces were like and intending to spend
a couple of years in them  actually spent seven
and if jacob got as much fun out of his first period
of service for rachel i dont wonder that he under-
took another seven when he found he had been
duped with leah during most of tliis time j acted
as secretary- to the vice-governor and acting
governor-general secretary to the university of
the philippines and assistant to the philippine com-
mission and i had the opportunity oi seeing the
islands and the workings of their government in and
out upside down and crosswise fur good measure
   also i spent a good deal of lime on different o -a-
sioni in japan and china so much so indeed lhn i
the camp-fire

feel quite as at home in the empire of the rising
sun and along the china coast as i do in new york
 have cruised about borneo and the dutch east
indies made the tourists visit to india and travel-
ed pretty generally through europe returning from
one visit to the united states by way of london
and the very excellently managed trans-siberian
railroad to vladivostok
t have also summered on a ranch in montana
  and camped out in the heart of the rockies
but i may as well confess  have never seen a typical
bad man nor a cow-puncher with the heart of sir
galahad and the shoulders of hercules-a bayard
in chaps nobody ever called me tenderfoot and
if they were impressed favorably or otherwise by
my london breeches they were too courteous to
show it i have however seen a rancher wearing a
revolver in fact i saw him buckle it on with evi-
dently a good deal of inward protest as he muttered
there isnt a chance of that damn badgers being
there now
   i also found that although i do not consider my-
self more than a fair horseman i could actually out-
ride and out manage a goodly number of the men on
the ranch-the average ranch hand could stay on a
bronco doing a moderate job of bucking about as
long as a fly could stick to a whirling buzz-saw but
it is only fair to say it was primarily a sheep ranch-
the horses and cattle were incidental to the sheep
hthe most complete typical cowboy outfit from
spur straps to sombrero i ever saw was worn
by a small boy of fourteen his father had ordered it
from a montgomery-ward catalogue lie was an
interesting boy by the way whose sallow face made
his name alfonso seem less incongruous than his
twang of the plains otherwise would he said little
but took in everything which went on evidently
studying and contrasting our speech and our ways
with those of the men with whom he ordinarily
associated
   and with all his boyish instinct for histrionics he
wished to be accepted on a mans basis showing a
good-natured willingness to do more than his proper
share of duties around camp the moment the old
herder had finished eating he would hurry off on
some suddenly discovered urgent business with the
sheep but alfonso although his billet was herders
assistant for the drive which freed him from the re-
sponsibilities of camp tending never failed lo help
with the tin dishes and i think the way we scrub-
bed those tin dishes was nothing short of heresy in
the old herders eyes to him dinner was no less
palatable because of the breakfast grease on the
plate
 know of only one time that i stood actually
   face to face with death that was un a submarine
in manila bay in which i was cruising as a guest
we were running awash preparatory to submerging
with the heavy cover of the conning-towcr closed
bat not sere wed home as it must be before the boat
dives the main tank was open-the one which
really changes her from a surface t an under-sea
crut and which because when full it only barely
sinks her to the waters level is made to withstand
ue pressure of the water at no greater depth than
bjow this its intake mu be dosed
  the commander a young ensign was in the cou-
ning-tower the crew at their various posts and i
sitting on a stool amidships with it must be con-
fessed a certain squeamishness at the pit of my
stomach in this sinking under the sea bottled up in
a two-by-four eggshell when without warning the
boat plunged downward and came to rest under
some thirty feet of water why the main tank did
not give way drowning us out of hand only the god
of strains knows
tt all happened so quickly that the inrush of
  water through the conning-tower drenching the
commander was my first intimation that something
was wrong but he was as cool as an autumn night
slipping from his post in the conning-towcr he
supervised the dosing of the valve of that deadly
main tank after which he pushed his wav back
through the inpouring water and screwed home the
top of the tower then a little grim about the mouth
but without comment he continued his cruise it
was not until we were back in his cabin on the
molher-ship tidying up for luncheon that i learned
just what had happened
gut the thrill of danger has been distinctly ex-
ceptional in most of my adventures a couple
of years ago in the mid-pacific with the wiie of a
high american official who was going out tor station
in the orient i was leaning over the rail watching the
asiatic steerage swarming over the main deck for-
ward in the bright sunshine when the whistle sud-
denly sounded the fire call there was the rush of
the chinese crew onto that part of the deck and a
thin line of blue smoke curled upward out f an
open hatch
   it was exciting but i fdt no thrill because it
seemed impossible that the great ship could be de-
stroyed by fire and so i continued to chat my
companion of the moment to mask a vague un-
easiness made some laughing but not unkind refer-
ence to the destruction of the dothes of the jap pas-
sengers who had now been herded together in wide-
eyed silence the fire was quickly extinguished
but the real laugh came that afternoon when the
offi dals wife learned that the only thing destroyed
had been her trunks and these trunks contained
almost her entire supply of gowns which were
nearly as important for her husbands succcss as
were his own tact and experience
just now i am living in a rginia village which
has traditions behind it and in its friendly if
inquisitive atmosjjhere i am tnnng to put on paper
some of the things i have lived and seen as well as
some of the livings i have only imagined myscu
living and seeing  
     ho knows about swords here is
     an appeal for information
  fmm reading advmiurr one would judge that
you are in toudi with men who possess a larce fund
of information ujn unusual subjects so that you
may be able to give me the answer to a question of
interest to me and on which there eems to be no in-
formation in washington
   in what year was the present design of sword for
general officers in the british scrvice adopted-
   the sword of the british general officer is identical
in pattern with the officers sword in the united

adventure
states marine corps but which was adopted first
last winter i obtained a fairly good authentication
ofthe marine corps tradition that our sword was
designed from a mameluke tulwar brought back to
the united states by lieutenant presley n oban-
non in  and it is absolutely certain the sword
was regularly worn iu  burtons book of the
sword would indicate that the curved sword was
adopted in europe about 
  any information you may be able to give to
assist me in running down this matter will be greatly
appreciated-m m suaw box  washing-

ptle following word from an american
at the front with the french foreign
legion was so exceptionally interesting
that our older brother everybodys publishes
it in its current issue but that is no reason
why all of the camp-fire should not also
hear what one of us has to say he men-
tions among other things the american
legion which he has joined and which as
you know was started by us of the camp-
fire the legion grows apace and we have
reason to be proud of it if you havent
joined it do your share toward the national

yesterday n the village of craonne until
laterly occupied by the germans i came
across a copy of adventure for the month of january
j a strange place to find your magazine you
will say but to me it is very welcome as i had not
seen it sincc last june i read with a great deal of
interest about the american legion and am writing
to ask you to put down my name
  as you will see from the envelope i am now in
second regiment of the foreign legion i enlisted
as a private soldier last august and now command a
scction of s men and am as far advanced in grade as
a foreigner can be in the french army- sous-
offidcr e regiment etranger bataillon c sectcur
postal no fi france
yvas very glad to receive your letter of the first
and i thank you very much for your kindness
in sending me the adventure i shall be very glad
to receive it as you can easily imagine our greatest
hardship in this sort of war is the deadly monotony
almost impossible to find books or periodicals so
you can imagine with what joy i seized on the ad-
venture that i found in a german advanced post
  i have also received a letter and application blank
from the american legion they are leaving by
this mail but  doubt very much if they will ever
arrive at destination i am however writing dr
llausmann under separate cover
wish i could tell you something about our life
here but i have no ability in the line of descrip-
tion however it is entirely different lo anything
else  have ever been in under false names i
fought with davilla against bonilla in honduras
and with madero against iia but this is a game
played with a different set of rules the king of in-
fantry encounters i- the hand-grenade the high-
power rirte is a joke  have scm for the last ten
months continual firing from one trench to another
sometimes at disuni es of fifty ti enty-five
meters  have seen uncalled-for panic lake both
sides on a dark night when each trench vould be a
continual line of fire hundreds ol men firing hun-
dreds of cartridges each and  have never seen a man
killed by a rille-ball
   but if you want to see a shambles visit a trench
just after a few hand-grenades have been thrown
into it the great sport here on both sides is hand-
grenading the other fellow how playedr- well
you leave your trench on a dark night with three or
four grenades nothing else then you pull yourself
along the ground toward the opposite trench no
crawling on hands and knees goes-too dangerous
slow business i have taken over three hours to
cover a hundred yards arrived at the other trenh
you keep still until you hear the relief coming gener-
ally between eleven and twelve or between one and
two when the relief is in the trench opposite you
you jump up throw your grenades and run ts if the
monster of sleepy hollow were after you if you
arc a good runner the surprise has been complete
and you know the moment to drop you should get
out of it alive
as i said before if you want to see a shambles
visit a trench or a communicating boyau after
one of these visits i have seen a whole half sec-
tion thirty-two men put out of business with four
grenades and the germans have undoubtedly had
much the same experience if we can believe the
prisoners we take also in attacking or dvfending
trenches the grenade rules king nothing like it
for cleaning out a trench or for stopping a masted
charge we all consider here that the total failure
of german attacks on this front for the last few
months should be attributed to our greater ability
in the use of grenades added to our greater love or
cold steel for the dutchman does not like the
bayonet
t am sure i am boring you my dear mr hoff-
man with my praise of the grenade but you
should sec the first lines of a french force when we
start after a german trench head face neck
arms and hands covered with vaselin against the
streams of vitriol a mask covering face and nose
and automobile goggles on the eyes against the
asphyxiating gases a baikct attached around the
waist containing ten or fifteen grenades and one is
off to lead an assault funny game this modern
