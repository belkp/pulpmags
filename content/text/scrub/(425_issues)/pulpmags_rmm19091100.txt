h a r r i m a n

by arthur b reeve

as an empire-builder julius caesar was insignificant compared with harri-
xv man and alexander the great who wept for more worlds to conquer
was a blubbering barbarian butcher in comparison with this frail
american railroad emperor the wealth that harriman controlled developed
or made possible of development would have bought up most of the kings
of the earth at any time since their toy kingdoms began to flutter aimlessly
through history

    he was the first railroad speculator who made excellence of property
the bait of success and he blazed a trail where all who come after must be
second to his unapproachable first the name harriman marks an epoch

the little giant who coupled a continent onto
his motive power and steamed unfailingly
with his load up every grade of
life until he reached the top

go

would

   the speaker
frail man
with a large
head and a
great pair of
spectacles over eyes
that seemed to pierce you
through and through

he was sitting before
the interstate com-
merce commission keen
and fresh after hours
and days of grilling
that had taxed the
greatest legal experts
in the country they

 r r

on as long as i live

was  an undersized

he was always a builder


the railroad mans magazine

had just led up to a crucial question
where his policy of acquisition of rail-
roads would stop

  there was nothing in the face of the
little man to suggest the leonine great-
ness of janies j hill the almost ascetic
tenacity of john d rockefeller nor the
cold relentless aristocratic power of
rogers nor the bold buccaneering bull
strength of j p morgan rather he
was the picture of a shrewd country
schoolmaster-a man who studied tilings
out his answer showed wherein the ob-
server was wrong in thinking the man a
student merely he was essentially a man
of action they had expected an evasive
answer quick as a flash came the quiet
reply

   i would go on as long as i live

  and he did go on as long as he lived
from office-boy in wall street to being
the greatest railroad magnate the world
ever produced  from the son of a poor
country clergyman to a power in the na-
tion greater in some respects than the
president himself-that was the amazing
career of edward henry harriman

  up to within an hour of his death he
was still the railroad financier  going
on as long as he lived dictating letters
to his stenographer literally bidding
death itself wait till he set in order his
railroads-one-fourth the mileage of the
united states with a capital equal to the
gross debt of the country

  harriman never but once let slip in
public his real dream in  not long
after the lines under his control had been
subjected to a searching investigation by
the government he took a trip over his
western roads and in the west was re-
ported as saying that he  would control
all the railroads in the united states if
he could get them

  the remark was characteristically im-
politic and was officially denied but it
was a tvical expression of his ambition
nor is there any doubt that he went far-
ther in gratifying such an ambition than
any other man thomas w lawson ex-
claimed when he heard the news of har-
rimans death  the king is dead  long
live the king 

   i would not say that i am the man
who successfully could organize all the
railroads of the united states and com-
bine and operate them under one man-

agement but that is what should be
done said harriman

  had he lived another five years it
might be predicted he would have added
another quarter if not more to his rail-
way dominion time only stood in the
way of the unfulfilled ambition of har-
riman-the man who would be railroad
king

  roughly speaking harrimans won-
derful career falls into four epochs
fifteen years spent as a youth twenty
years spent in learning the wall street
game  ten years spent learning railroad
operation and development and then
about fifteen years spent in adding one
railroad to another in the great harri-
man system

  the greater part of his railroad king-
dom came to him after he had reached
the age of fifty in the little over ten years
since  in those years of a mans life
during which dr osier says he should
be chloroformed his manner in busi-
ness was cold and snappy

his start in life

  edward h harriman was born on
february   in the rectory of st
georges episcopal church at hemp-
stead long island it was a poor
church then but now it is a fashionable
parish attended by many whom mr
harriman has enriched

  harriman was one of six children at
the end of fifteen years he had to go to
work although he longed to be a soldier

  his first employment was as an office-
boy with a brokerage - house in wall
street there he ran errands and did
the odd jobs which hundreds of small
boys are doing in offices to-day the
office-boy took to the methods and intri-
cacies of the street naturally intuitively

  it was a fortunate chance that took
him to this environment he was quick-
witted and the years of privation he had
gone through gave him a rare judgment
far beyond his age working among
millions lie never forgot that a single
dollar had a purchasing and investing
power which in the mass made possible
success

  at eighteen he was a partner in the
firm  at twenty-two he bought a seat on
the exchange where he got the money
               i

harriman



no one knows some say ins wealthy
uncle furnished it probably he had al-
ready saved it from his speculations at
any rate old-timers on the exchange will
tell you that he was one of the stingiest
traders on the floor that he never let a
dollar get away from him that he could
possibly hold  to they accuse him of

being a  two-dollar man a piker a
 shoe-string  speculator perhaps he
was he knew what he was doing

  he organized the firm of harriman 
co and went after business he got
it too moreover he got some big
traders and made large sums on commis-
sions but his main fortune came from


the railroad mans magazine

his own speculation time and again he
risked almost all he had but it wasnt
really a risk for as he once said in a
confiding moment he  made speculation
safe by the information at his com-
mand

  during this period he married mary
averill daughter of a railroad man and
banker interested in the rome water-
town and ogdensburg railway in new
york the marriage was a happy one
and furthermore added to his wealth
even more in the store of knowledge of
railroads that he drew from his father-in-
law than in money

his horses beat vanderbilts

  harriman was gaining influence when-
ever he had a chance he had a way of
ingratiating himself with the old knick-
erbocker families and he soon had many
of them as customers even at that earlv
day there was only one way in which you
could see harriman at play he loved
fast horses then as he did to the day of
his death

  old commodore vanderbilt used
often to drive his teams along the old
boston road and the youngster who was
one day to break into the old commo-
dores new york central took delight in
a brush with him especially when lie left

the vanderbilt team behind but his
life was soon all work and little play
harriman has had little time for play
perhaps he would have lived longer if
he had certainly he would not have
gone farther

  twenty years of harrimans life were
rounded out in learning the stock mar-
ket though he got the railroad idea as
early as  it was not until  that
he settled down in earnest to learn rail-
roads it was ten years later before he
really got a chance to work out his
knowledge of both finance and railroads

ten years learning railroading

  stuvvesant fish gave him his start-
the stuyvesant fish with whom he later
waged one of his bitterest fights fish
had met harriman on the exchange but
after a few years had left the floor and
gone back to railroading with the illinois
central in is lie was vice-president
and in that year put harriman into the
directorate of the road that was har-
rimans first direct connection with a
railroad

  harriman did not believe in being a
director who does not direct he
plunged headlong into illinois central
atfairs he inspected every mile of the
system he went over the whole meth-
od of management he investigated
every contract he even averaged sala-
ries with those of other roads there
was nothing he didnt know he even
knew what the central paid for spikes

  thus it came about that when fish
became president in s harriman be-
came vice-president gradually he be-
came the ruling mind of the road once
when fish went abroad harriman cut
loose and ran things to suit himself
some of the heads of departments re-
signed in a rage but it is not related
that it was not a great thing for illinois
central the big men behind illinois
central saw what harriman was accom-
plishing and began to appreciate it

  harriman studied everything about
railroads up to about  then he
was satisfied tliat his railroad education
was complete and that it was time for
him to get out and do things

  in his first big fight his opponent was
no less a power than j pierpont mor-
gan who even at that day was doctor
to every sick bank or railroad the
fight was over erie curiously one of
his last fights was with morgan over
erie still more curious one of his last
visitors to whom ft is said he entrusted
much of the futuje of his lines was
morgan

  the old new york lake erie and
western in  was sick unto death
and receivers had been appointed early
in january of  a reorganization
plan was announced by j p morgan
 co harriman then little known
with other owners of second - mortgage
bonds opposed an assessment and
formed a  protective committee he
laid his case before morgan

   whom do you represent mr har-
riman  asked the financier

  with that laconic manner that always
characterized him he replied directly

   myself

chance came with panic

  this was the key to harrimans rail-
road career he represented himself
people have said he was a standard oil
man that he was a vanderbilt man that
lie was some one elses man he has
been harriman  myself thats
what he has always represented any-
one who got in his way found that the
harriman express runs straight ahead
switches spiked

  however he lost his first fight de-
spite protests the reorganization was car-
ried out even after a suit it was put
through when in  the second
battle over erie with morgan came
harrimans position was the exact re-
verse he won that fight

  at any rate even though he lost in
 he had started his railroad career
he went slow at first for remember it
was for himself not others that he was
building and waiting his chance

  at last the chance came it grew out
of the panic of  harriman has al-
ways grown with panics - but lie lias
thriven with prosperity in  a quar-
ter of all the railroads were in re-
ceivers hands the great union pa-
cific from omaha to ogden was one of
the worst - two streaks of rust on a
bunch of ties and with all due respect

to hustling omaha and ogden begin-
ning nowhere and ending nowhere

  but it had the possibilities of becom-
ing the spine of the country while
wall street was resurrecting the dead
bodies of railroads union pacific seemed
beyond hope of resurrection

  but harriman after studying it close-
ly thought differently and what was
more to the point succeeded in making
other capitalists think with him it is
useless to enumerate who were in the
syndicate ihat bought it no one con-
sidered harriman as important

  it was generally credited to be a van-
derbilt syndicate they paid the gov-
ernment about  for the
eighteen hundred miles of rust and
worn-out equipment and an additional
sum to bondholders and for subsidiary
lines then they brought out a com-
pany reorganized with 
bonds  preferred stock and
 common

  the common stock now worth double
its par value was distributed all around
the other securities were turned over to
the syndicate to reimburse it or were
used to purchase minor lines

  harriman took a trip over the road
to see just how and why the spirit had


the railroad mans magazine

gone out of the men who ran it and the
people along its lines it is told that
one of the old rattle-trap engines on his
train loafed even longer than usual ta-
king water until harriman lost patience

   whats this delay  he demanded of
the division superintendent

   get larger engines

   engines taking water sir

   why not make the feed - pipe
larger  snapped harriman

   the engine wouldnt stand it

   then well get some larger engines
it was one of harrimans boasts that
he replaced eight-inch feed-pipes on the
u p with twelve-inch thereby saving
one minute and thirty-nine seconds in
the movement of a train every time the
engine needed water there was noth-
ing he didnt attempt for economy and
efficiency perhaps if he had lived he
would actually have introduced his wider
gage which he had hinted at often

  harriman did not stop with new
equipment or with automatic block-sig-
nals engineers will tell you that one
of his greatest feats was in securing the
completion of the famous lucin cut-off
across the great salt lake by which ten
complete circles in the -mile old

i- - -

he longed to be a soldier

route were eliminated  degrees of
curvature and  feet of vertical
climb

  great tunnels were built grades re-
duced at hundreds of points only
show it to be for ultimate economy and
harriman was ready to say  build it
and spend money tike water for the
money came back

  once a director complained of cost
 we havent bought a railroad here
was harrimans reply  weve bought
an empire

gathering in the roads

  it was this reasoned faith in the fu-
ture which amazed wall street and the
country not only was harriman ma-
king tj p worth something but he was
gradually gathering in other roads the
first was the oregon short line and
then-the oregon railroad and naviga-
tion company it was a question
whether the oregon short line would
have to be bought or whether it would
exchange its stock and come in peace-
ably

  harriman adopted the peaceable
course  is road was just beginning to
boom and with a little coaxing the
short line stockholders were made to
see that it would be a good exchange

  harriman had had faith that great
good times were coming after mckin-
leys first election when rockefeller
was scared to death over the political
outlook harriman reassured him and
harriman as the prophet secured
standard oil money whenever he need-
ed it

  new ventures now came thick and
fast so thick and fast as to bewilder
every one except harriman who planned
them in that superior sphere where as
william nelson cromwell said it was
not permitted for others to intrude the
alton deal came next how he and his
associates  reorganized  that road is
still fresh in the public mind acquisi-
tion of the kansas city southern on
somewhat similar lines came next then
followed the coup in southern pacific

  harriman was looking out for new
worlds to conquer he saw to the south
collis p huntington to the north james
harriman



j hill huntingtons vast work had
been central pacific and southern pa-
cific late in  huntington died
suddenly  his estate and those of the
crockers and stanfords controlled the
road speyer  co being the bankers

  harriman went quietly to work to
gain control buying right and left
the next thing wall street heard was
on february   when the control
of southern pacific had been bought by
union pacific

  the announcement came as a thunder-
clap if you want to know where har-
riman was most cordially hated go
down in the financial district to the
offices on whose doors is the name
 speyer  co harriman had his
much-desired outlet to the pacific and
the great southern line from the cali-
fornia coast to the gulf with its impor-
tant steamship connection with new
york

  it made harriman the leading rail-
road factor in the west-allowed him to
tap the region from chicago to new
orleans down the mississippi valley on
the east and from portland to ios an-
geles down the pacific coast on the west

  here again ttie harriman  myself 
method came into play almost direct-
ly after the purchase one of the officers
resigned  then many

  what was the matter a friend
asked of one

    well he replied  i didnt think
flie southern pacific should be com-
pelled to pay  a year for an
office-boy when harriman got through
working there wasnt anything left for
me to do i couldnt buy a ton of rails
or a switch-engine without his o k

quick to punish

  some time later harriman had a hard
fight over southern pacific james r
keene tried to force him to pay divi-
dends before he was ready keene got
a terrible trouncing for that harriman
did it by forcing t j taylor  co
keenes son - in - law to the wall and
taking away  from the keene
s p pool

  so harriman was master of union
pacific and southern pacific before
wall street had recovered from its

surprise over the sudden change in
southern pacific harriman was after
northern pacific and one of the most
interesting chapters in the countrys
financial history had begun

  hill and morgan had just purchased
the burlington as an outlet for north-
ern pacific and great northern into
chicago again harriman went to
morgan   demand an interest in
burlington for my union pacific he
said hill shook his head and morgan
smiled

  they failed to note the threat im-
plied in this unusual request before
they knew what was going on harri-
man had purchased in the open market
a majority of the stock of n p har-
rimans campaign culminated in may
 with n p shares quoted at 
a share throwing the whole stock mar-
ket into one of the worst panics ever
recorded harriman won the first
round

  but there was a right of the common
to call in the preferred stock and by
exercising it over-night the hill-mor-
gan group holding mostly common stole
a march on the harriman group holding


the railroad mans magazine

mostly preferred

harriman was check-
mated the com-
promise agreed on
was the northern
securities company
whereby both were
to deposit their
shares and thus es-
tablish a  commu-
nity of interest

  it is a matter of
too recent history to
need recounting how
the government in-
tervened instituted
the northern securi-
ties suit disrupted
the merger and flung
all into chaos again

  harriman wanted his original n p
shares back hill and morgan wanted
to divide both n p and great north-
ern pro rata after a long suit the
hill-morgan plan prevailed but even
then harriman wasnt altogether beaten
in  when the rumors were afloat
of the cutting of the hill melon in the
shape of distributing profits from ore
lands and these stocks were booming
he sold the stocks at a profit of -
 and with this in the open mar-
ket harriman later increased his hold-
ings in baltimore and ohio and new
york central

  if he couldnt control the northwest
then he would creep back into the east
west and southwest were his

beaten by hill and morgan

  harriman had a new fight on his
hands every few months after that he
had been elected a trustee of the equita-
ble life assurance company and as he
increased his influence he tapped another
source of capital for his great enterprises
second only to standard oil when
hyde and alexander began to row har-
riman began to secure control of the
company

  at the beginning of the row harriman
was hydes closest adviser  hut for some
reason or other after the frick commit-
tee report hyde suddenly conceived the
suspicion that harriman was playing
him false

 now mr hyde
was more interested
in social matters
than in finance like
many another man
if he couldnt have
it all he was not
averse to pulling
down the whole
building over the
ears of every one
concerned in his-
almost gallic man-
ner he one day ac-
cused harriman of
treachery harri-
man bursting with
rage almost lost the
power to speak his
reply was a classic
in the cartoons for a time

   wow wow wow 

  harriman resigned then hyde be-
gan to dicker with ryan harriman
was boiling over with anger at this coup
of ryans arranged by the adroit hand
of root

not yet but soon

  he made a threat to get even with
ryan all this was brought out during
the insurance investigation among other
questions asked mr harriman was
whether he had yet made good his re-
venge his answer created a new piece
of classic slang

   not yet but soon

  out of the depression of -
and the uncertainty of the exposures of
financial rottenness of  the harri-
man system came-still on top there
was nothing that could put it down for
it was not as so many people said a
speculative venture speculation was re-
duced by knowledge to a certainty

  then came the boom of -a boom
of even greater proportions than those
after mckinleys first election and in
 the system went ahead just the
same in prosperity as in panic the cul-
mination was the union pacific dividend
episode when for the first time ten per
cent was declared on the common in
august  along with five per cent
on southern pacific common as an initial
dividend

there are two factors which work against

prosperity one is idle men and
the other is idle capital
harriman



  there was one phase of this episode
that very vitally affected harrimans at-
tainment of his ambition when he de-
cided to raise the dividend he casually
omitted to mention it to any one in ad-
vance no one in wall street was
 on no one had loaded up with the
stock to make a coup

  if there was to be any speculating in
union pacific and any great money made
out of it harriman was going to do it
himself

  just as a side diversion came the final
fight with fish about this time

  it was a long fight involving the

western coast more than half is com-
pleted harrimans work in mexico has
been of so great size that he has en-
countered there much the same opposi-
tion as at home his relations with the
government have been such that there
too an anti-harriman party has grown
up in opposition to diaz

  harriman was undoubtedly looking to
the development of mexico with much
the same kind of longing as hill looks
at the canadian northwest

  all the time harriman was looking
for eastern outlets to the atlantic-the
dream of all railroaders -  ocean to

in wall street he
was an active ener-
getic speculator

seeking of proxies in the ends of the
earth fish was ousted from the presi-
dency of illinois central for casting
sheeps-eyes at hill his successor was
a harriman man mr j t harahan
that was the last of harrimans long
and spectacular fights in railroads and
the markets he made many conquests
afterward but they were mostly peaceful
conquests

   the north and south harriman lines
from puget sound to guadalajara mex-
ico are almost as important as the lines
east and west said mr harriman in an
interview just before he died

  in mexico the southern pacific plans
the construction of  miles down the

ocean he had passed through many
panics and escaped unhurt his asso-
ciates remarked that they guessed harri-
man enjoyed panics he -must have en-
joyed the one in - it virtually
completed his ocean-to-ocean plans-not
only with one line but with three

  in april  the erie short-term
notes matured harriman and a number
of other railroad men and bankers met
at an up-town club one night to deter-
mine what should be done on the next
and last day when  must be
paid by that road

  it was one of eries chronic crises
harriman argued that erie was worth
the money needed that the recovery from

cos-xo

panic would be delayed unless the notes
were met all night harriman stood
alone the others favored a receivership
they argued till morning and still stood
the same harriman went home still
thinking it over then before the closc
of the business day he sent morgan a
letter saying he would pay the notes
himself

  that action single - handed against
the judgment of the directors was char-
acteristic it saved the erie and it
saved more than one other corporation
from a receivership it helped the re-
turn of prosperity above all it clinched
harrimans ocean - to - ocean control by
means of erie

products of the panic

  besides his baltimore and ohio hold-
ings there have been mentioned the har-
riman investments in new york central
and hence also in lake shore another of
harrimans ocean-to-ocean connections
just what the union pacific holdings are
is not known exactly but it is known that
up to the very day
of his death harri-
mans mind was ac-
tive with plans for
the betterment of
new york central

  still another prod-
uct of the panic was
the acquisition of the
central of georgia
by the illinois cen-
tral the great in-
dustrial development
of the south strong-
ly attracted harri-
man  it was just the
sort of tiling he
liked to get in un-
der and capitalize in
advance

his manner in business was cold
and snappy

harriman roads compared
with those of hill
morgan the vander-
bilts and gould

when the news of harrimans death
reached president harahan in the south
he exclaimed the south will never
know what a good friend it had in mr
harriman

  ocean to ocean lakes to gulf middle
west far west pacific coast mexico
the orient northwest southwest south
and to a great extent the east and new
england-that was the great harriman
railroad empire when the little railroad
corsican passed away at arden on sep-
tember 

his personal side

  what manner of man was this man
harriman first of all he learned rap-
idly once he was secretive but from
 to  he was in a lot of trouble
with the people through ignorance and
misunderstanding then he did what
he never did before in his life he be-
gan to talk to newspapers

  it was as if the sphinx spoke he
kept in touch with public sentiment
through a most comprehensive and elab-
orate press-clipping system operated by
a competent man in the office of each
all the papers of a
locality were sum-
marized as to their
attitude toward the
roads and the sum-
mary was telegraphed
to mr julius krutt-
schnitt director of
maintenance and
way in chicago

  everything w a s
expressed in percent-
ages and figures it
was an accurate gage
of public opinion
and after it had been
collected and unified
at chicago mr har-
riman read it noth-
ing like it had ever
been attempted

general manager
harriman



  he was doing everything to overcome
his aloofness he was not so averse to
meeting strangers and instead of stamp-
ing and swearing at reporters he called
them  my boys and spoke of them as
his friends when he came back from
europe dying he insisted on seeing the
reporters in his private car

  it was a different harriman

  he made one vital remark at a din-
ner   there are two factors that work
against prosperity one is idle men
the other is idle capital

   i have never put my mind on any-
thing yet that i havent been able to
accomplish he replied  my brain
now is keener than it ever was and if
hard work wont affect it how will it
affect my body i thrive on hard
work

  even when he did go in search of
health he could not put business away
entirely some time ago when he was
ordered to take an automobile trip to
europe away from railroads and tele-
graphs he consented

  he had said that he was going to re-
tire  his sixtieth birthday in 
that time came and he announced that
he was too busy to think of it but all
that time as during the previous five
years he was really fighting the greatest
battle of all-against ill health

  his greatest victories were won while
he carried on this losing fight yet he
never let the truth become known to his
foes or even to his friends-perhaps only
to himself at the very last yet for
many years lie was forced to wear cor-
sets for spine trouble due to his inactive
physical life

  time and again his doctors warned
him to retire but to no purpose they
didnt even get him to keep his promise
about retiring at sixty when they ar-
gued with him he replied that his nerve
power would pull him through

when he thought of gasoline
motors for railroads

  but as lie convalesced he began to
think of his string of machines as a
railroad train then an idea came to
him he began to keep strict account of
gasoline expenses the drivers began
to worry over his supposed economy and
trouble was averted only when he assured
them that h wasnt spying on the
amount of gasoline they burned up
harrimans restless mind had conceived
the idea of gasoline motors for separate
coaches on small spurs of his railroads

always practical

  he was investigating when he got
back he had some such coaches built
and they are to-day running on many
small lines where the traffic is too light
for a locomotive to pay

even last spring when in alarm he


the railroad mans magazine

had to take a vacation he couldnt quite
make up his mind to quit his vacation
was in a tent in mexico where his new-
est interests lay

  a telephone wire kept him in touch
with business all the time then he
decided to go to europe he must have
felt it was a losing fight but he neg-
lected no chances that was how he
conducted his business fights might it
not succeed in the fight for life

  while in europe fighting his last
fight he learned that a plot had been
hatched to wrest from him control of
his railroad empire and no ship could
take him h o m e
quickly enough

he knew what it
meant

  he carried on
everything as if a
long life of power
and health lay be-
fore him he did
everything but talk
of death he fin-
ished his new home
at arden he com-
pleted the plans to
carry on his roads
after his death

  he came home
to defend his em-
pire and to die
and he died in his
armor-one of the
most heroic rail-
road figures that
ever lived

  harriman was a
small man nar-
row chested look-
ing anything but
the part of a great railroad builder but
though frail in physical strength he was
one of the most resourceful fighters of
modern times there was only one word
he didnt understand and that was
 quit life to him was a long un-
yielding fight and yet there was an-
other harriman that the world did not
often see

what he did for boys

  over on the east side of new york
there is a handsome building on avenue

a opposite tompkins square it is the
boys club those east side boys saw
the real harriman when they gave a
play he was always one of them once
when they couldnt get a hall he hired
sherrys for them often he dropped in
to see how the club was getting along

  on an outing he had been known to
bat out flies to the boys he took them
up to groton once for an athletic con-
test with that aristocratic school where
one of his sons was studying and rooted
for the-east side boys was that the
harriman of union pacific

  harriman had a golf course laid out
and then never
played over it yet
he only spent four
days a week at his
busy office his
recreations were pe-
culiarly his own
building the great
home on the high-
est of the ramapo
mountains and
contemplating i t s
broad thirty thou-
sand acres was
one of them his
devotion to his
f a  i  y was an-
other but the
harriman of stren-
uous play - never
his greatest recrea-
tion was after all
business

  one thing hurt
him he knew
that the world
thought he had
no friends that
he made railroad men under him mere
machines and that the men hated him
once in a burst of self - defense he
exclaimed  ask the workers on my
railroads if theyre not all harrimans
friends and then if they wont testifv
for me ask my neighbors if you think
there is no humanity in harriman go
up to arden and find out

   but the only side tliat really count-
ed was the harriman who would be
railroad king- the man who would  go
on as long as he lived whatever he
was doing he was always building

by j r stafford

               an ignorant man is a weak one
               but strength is often disguised

  it would take all
bread an meat ye
there mister to fill
ip but i jist caint
to eat when any one
is watcliin me so if its
j is asame to you ill take the grub an
go off by mysef to eat it the rather
foolish-faced lanky and ragged boy of
twelve or thereabouts looked appealingly
down into the hard eyes of old burkett

  burkett grizzled and unkempt-after
the fashion of market hunters-squat-
ting huge bulked before the tire 
which a frying-pan sizzled puckered his
tufted gray brows in calculation as he
looked from the lad to the big camp oven
filled with new baked bread

    boys he at last observed  has 
insides then he stared for a moment
around the camp and suddenly exclaimed 
 boy ef ye air a tramp wy up an
say so but ye neednt be one no more
im a needin a boy powerful bad taint
the work so much as that im a gettin old
an need a young an handy feller to talk
to of a night wy not jist stop ith
me 

  out of the rapture into which he had
been thrown at sight of a gun leaning
against the tentthe youth replied me-
chanically 

-	 nope i gotta go

  burkett smiling through his beard
spread the newspaper thoughtfully
brought by the young vagrant and on it
dumped the ovenful then having poured
over the bread the contents of the frying-
pan he made up a bundle incomparably
ungeometrical in shape after a pride-
ful survey of this he clutched it tightly
and again persuaded

    boy you air a passin up a powerful
good chance to make somethin out  yer-
sef a powerful good chance  got a
little double barl shotgun id give ye
an id larn ye to decoy ducks an geese
an shoot em on the fly an id show
ye how to ketch fish in the summer an
mink an muskrat in winter time an
of a night wed set by the fire an id tell
ye about the war an picketts charge
an by the time ye growed up ye would
be a man  stid  jist a bum

   for a moment the youths spaniel-eyes
brightened  these vistas of delight but
the glow suddenly went out as with a
gulp and a look of fear he exclaimed

    nope i gotta go i jist gotta go
burkett tossed him the bundle al-
ready moving off lie caught it and kept
going as fast as his awkward legs would
carry him underfoot the corn-field
littered with last years stalks was deep
with mud from the march rains but he
never stopped to rest maintaining his
ungainly trot until it had carried him the
full half mile to the railroad track
there he vanished behind the tall grass
fringing the right of way

   at that the duck-hunter started in
pursuit he crossed the field in the
boys tracks and approaching the rail-
road fence with noiseless step at last put
a steadying hand to a post and cocked
his head to listen

   he heard the voices of men and then
crawled carefully between the wires as
he smashed his way through the screen
of crackling stems and blades three men
lolling about a fire lifted their faces in
lazy inquiry

  obviously they were tramps it was
apparent also that they were now eating


the railroad -mans magazine

a dinner at burketts expense for their
hands were clutching huge biscuits lie
had baked and rinded bacon he had
fried between them lay the newspaper
bare of everything but crumbs and a
solitary half biscuit upon this rem-
nant the boy who sat apart was gazing
in profound speculation

  burkett understood w ithout a word
of warning he dashed at the feasters
now rising to their feet into their
midst he shot with an ear-splitting
screech like a bomb he seemed sud-
denly to explode hurling terrific fists on
every side the assaulted went down
together on the trampled grass where
they sat gingerly feeling their bruises

  now the victor commanded you
boy  you come ith me these fellers is
no good you jist stand right up now
an tell em they air a pack o bov-robbin
skunks

  the lad staring open-mouthed at the
burliest of the trio started to obey and
then trembling stopped

   tell em whut  say burkett fairly
boomed  ef they even dast to open
their heads to ye ill give em a dang
sight more 

  at that in a kind of panic the youth
dashed to the cover of the hunters elbow
and from that redoubtable position not
only repeated burketts characterization
of the trio but others of his own compo-
sition strangely picturesque and profane

  when the long-pent torrents had
flowed till only the dregs of epithet re-
mained burkett took him by the hand
then the pair having crawled back into
the field crossed it to the camp

   whuts yer name boy  the old man
demanded as they entered the tent

   fellers called me squib

   well ye air a goin to be more than
any blank catridge ef ye stay an grow
up ith me i had army trainin an i
haint forgot it i wuz a soldier under
pickett

  he paused and a strange fire gleamed
in his eyes as with shaking head he de-
clared  boy them days i wuz jist nach-
erally hell an repeat but his glance
softened as he concluded

   i am a goin to name ye bob jones
after the boss i rode in picketts charge
an all the good an bad water spanl
dawgs ive owned sense the war

  in this manner the waif became bob
tones and his fortunes linked with those
of old burkett

  when the fact became generally known
up and down the bottoms the good
people - for everywhere there are good
people-generous to think and do espe-
cially to think for others made up their
minds the boy should have a better
chance for to them old burketts con-
duct in every particular shouted the very
antithesis of their ideals

  they dwelt in fixed abodes he rosmed
along the missouri sheltering in a tent
they planted and plowed and reaped
sweating with toil and worry he merely
hunted and trapped and fished leisurely
and carefree they gave full weights
of grain they had produced he often art-
fully sold mud-hens for teal bullheads
for catfish and it was affirmed had
palmed off rabbit skins for muskrat hides

  after they had paid for the neces-
saries of life they put the remainder of
their money at interest he invested his in
whisky or lemon extract which went
further

  on sundays they went to town to sit
soberly in the church and listen to ser-
mons of peace after which they cordially
shook hands with even those they might
have disliked he came to parade the
street drunkenly and collect a crowd of
loafers to whom he would boastingly tell
of the war and picketts charge in which
he claimed to have actually killed one
hundred of the enemy and he would
wind up then by daring any one to fight
him in short he surpassed the ordinary
type of river-rat in general worthlessness

  it was with these facts in mind that
deacon smith got up in prayer-meeting
ore wednesday evening and earnestly
pleaded that the brand might be plucked
from the burning a newcomer who did
not know much about -old burkett but
who made ftp for this trifling lack of
knowledge in a courageous zeal for good
works volunteered to go to the camp and
get the boy

  at the next-meeting this one limped
painfully to his pew when experiences
were in order he instantly rose and with
a blackened eye fixed sternly on the
deacon vehemently repudiated the mis-
sion lie had so blithely pledged himself
to perform
general burketts disciple



  again the deacon pleaded eloquently
but no one volunteered then being a
conscientious man he rather grudgingly
signified his intention to go himself

  so next day with his gun on his
shoulder for he loved to hunt lie made
his way to the river as the mallards
were flying well he first attended to the
business of killing a dozen or so of them
at noon he strode up to old burketts
camp the man and boy were already
there eating dinner

   burkett the deacon spoke with a

the boy to whom this golden opportunity
had been offered instead of embracing
it merely stuck out his tongue and
wagged his head very naturally this
offended the deacon and very naturally
too he exclaimed

   if you dont come ill cut a switch
an tan your jacket

   umiiu  the refusing one dared
 you tetcli me an the general hell make
moren a christian man o you hell
make ye outrun yer dog a gittin acrost
that field

 ef they even dast to open their heads to ye ill give em a dang sight more  

forced civility  that boy ought to be in
school

   you an him fur it deacon ef e
wants to go e kin go

  astounded at the ease with which he
had gained his end the good man some-
what pridefully shouldered his gun and
commanded 

   come with me boy i am goin to
take ve home and make a christian man
of ye

  he was now further astounded for

  at this though roaring with laughter
old burkett began to roll up his sleeves

   you have already corrupted him
mebbe beyond redemption the deacon
declared white-lipped-for he expected a
beating- but i shall go to the law he
sliant be your disciple no longer

 all right deacon burkett boomed
with unexpected good humor  i jist
wisht ye would boss us into the court
wherefore a couple of days afterward
the sheriff came to the camp and took the


the railroad mans magazine

pair to the county seat where county
court was in session

  now the county judges were farmers
and they did not wish to put any new
burden on the taxpayers moreover

his sallow face flamed red his brown
eyes glowed like two coals from which
a breath had swrept the ash  and jumping
up and down in a kind of paroxysm he
screamed

hell make ye outrun yer dog a gittin acrost that field

deacon smith had worked against the
election of two of them besides there
were some sixteen voters present in the
room at that moment fiercely demanding
an appropriation of thirty-seven dollars
and thirty-five cents for a bridge over
squaw creek

  they of course felt a vague interest
in the boy they listened impatiently to
the deacon and then the presiding judge
having asked bob if he wished to leave
burkett and go to the deacon and having
received a surprisingly emphatic negative
they dismissed the whole matter and
turned their attention to real business

  forthwith burliett led the boy into
the probate court and by means of much
red tape painstakingly unrolled adopted
him

  then the pair marched proudly down
the corridor and coming out found the
deacon sitting dejectedly on the steps
at sight of him the boy paused abruptly

   when i git big ill kill ye ill
kill ye 

  hush bob jones old burkett
chided fiercely  ye dassent to kill cep-
in in war tell im yell pound the soup
out of im

   then ill pound the soup out o ye
ill pound the soup out o ye the
lads voice echoed with unabated wrath

  at that the duck-hunter caught him
up and then with a mighty swagger
quitted the courtyard

  that was the last effort made with a
view of separating them under old
burketts tutelage the lad grew to be
an ungainly but very strong man pro-
foundly igorant and of course supreme-
ly disdainful of all things outside of his
own little world

  in that narrow circle however he
was really a genius he shot with a pre-
cision marvelous even among men
brought up from childhood to the gun
general burketts disciple



and as a fisherman trapper or boatman
he was equally proficient his attitude
toward old burkett was also worth com-
ment

  his readiness to obey that worthy
was a constant reminder of that other
famous bob jones of picketts charge
while the devotion that shone always
from his brown eyes recalled the faithful-
ness of all those spaniels which since
the war had borne the name in fact
save for two rather trivial personal in-
terests-his hatred of deacon smith and
an astonishing delight in his own silky
and inconsequent whiskers his whole
thought and effort were for his guar-
dian

  it would seem that all this devotion
might have had an ennobling influence
on its recipient but it is a lamentable
fact that old burkett never changed
his ways one whit through all the
years he scoffed at industry other than
his own told wilder tales than ever of
his prowess in the war grew more quar-
relsome with the world in general and
since bobs efforts brought more money
drank even more prodigiously

  thus it happened that one sleeting
day in march the old man having gone
to town for shot shells returned to the
camp with his pockets filled with bottles
from jack renfros drug-store instead
and going out to his shooting-pit in the
afternoon did not return

  when bob came in from running a
line of mink traps that night he went
out there and found him stiff and cold
in death he carried the body back to
the tent and sat with it until day then
leaving the dog to watch he ran all the
way in to town quite out of breath he
entered the furniture-store and asked
for a coffin which he naively promised
to pay for as soon as the shooting
opened

  the dealer was a tight-fisted and un-
imaginative man he scoffed at the idea
of a sale on terms requiring him to wait
for his money until wild geese and ducks
at that moment roaming over florida or
headed for nova scotia for all he knew
should fly a thousand miles or more to
eiselman bar with no other purpose in
their fool heads than to get shot more-
over he was a brother-in-law to deacon

gated at the drug-store requested

smith he dismissed the would-be cus-
tomer and his proposal as preposterous

  dismayed beyond description bob
rushed down to jack renfros drug-store
and poured out his troubles there then
jack though lie was a flashy young fel-
low of rather doubtful morals-his drug-
store was really a dive-straightway has-
tened to the furniture-store and with
his own money somewhat ostentatiously
paid for a casket

  the gratitude of old burketts pro-
tegee at this was pitiful his further
efforts to gather a crowd for funeral
honors on behalf of his dead were how-
ever altogether fruitless so he got the
long box on his back and plodded alone
across the fields to the camp

  next morning he moved the tent
where it had stood beneath the great
sycamore in a spot commanding a wide
sweep of the river and the shooting
grounds of eiselman bar in the spot
clearest of earth to old burkett he dug
the grave there with only the solemn
spaniel looking on he heaped the mound
with loving care

  that afternoon he went back to
town and in the presence of the loafers
congregated at the drug-store requested
renfro for  some writins to put over
the generals grave

  the crowd of course laughed but
renfro who was one of the best fellows
on earth-extrinsically-inquired with a
rare deference what it was that the epi-
taph should convey

   i want it to say the facks the
general he wuz a soldier an as brave
as they ever wuz he didnt fear noth-
in nothin a titter ran round
at this whereupon bob straightened his
stooping shoulders and with a look of
mild reproof on his rather vacuous face
he concluded   an he wuz a mighty
good man fur he took me from tramps
an made me whut i am

  a shout greeted this but renfro with
a solemn wink at this and that chosen
habitue of the place tore a piece of
wrapper from the roof at his elbow and
then getting out his pencil bowed over
the counter -and wrote the following

   general burkett age place of birth
and cause of death unknown claimed
to have killed one hundred men in pick-
etts charge this is likely for ever since

the war wherever he has gone he has
always left behind him a string of dead
soldiers ttis good works live after
him witness bob jones his mark

  he made bob subscribe to it with a
cross after which he showed it to the
crowd then amid the bedlam that
went up he got a big flask from behind
the prescription case and proffered it
to the guileless one

   ef its booze bob declared slowly
 i dont want it the general he pri-
vately told me often when he wuz sober
that ef it hadnt a ben fur booze he
might a ben knowecl fur a great man by
more people than jist me an hissef

   all right bob the druggist re-
turned with unruffled suavity for he was
making sport to please the crowd  i
suppose now that the general is dead
youll quit the old river

   nope jist keep on asame old wav
when a feller has been lor ought up to a
good business as i have he ort to stay
with it the general he alius lowed
that he would have been a heap better
off ef he had stayed with the army after
the war ef he had though i never
would a run acrost im it might a ben
better fur him but it would a ben al-
mighty tough on me

  at this even renfro gave way to his
long-pent laughter then since he was
beginning to feel some qualms though
they were it must be admitted vague
ones he passed over the paper

  bob took it and putting it carefully
in the pocket of his flannel shirt ambled
out where the march sunshine soon drove
all doubt from his simple mind

  two or three days after that when
the wind bad swung round to the east
where great cloud-drifts lay threatening
storm deacon smith venerable now and
softened by the years but with his old-
time ardor for shooting unabated came
down to the river for the sport that a
rain would surely bring his youngest
son a man of thirty was with him

  as the two were passing the sycamore
they noted that the tent was gone
wherefore in that curiosity that all men
display in the presence of deserted home
sites they went to it and found old
burketts grave and above it renfros
epitaph tacked neatly  the shining
bark


general burketts disciple



  now the deacon did not comprehend
that clause- has always left behind
him a string of dead soldiers but the
son did and explained that it referred
to old burketts trail of empty bottles

  on a sudden then the old man saw in
the ignorance that had suffered such a
cruel joke a long-hoped-for opportunity
to rescue the half-savage bob more-
over his heart was strangely touched at
the symbolism of burketts grave

but by dint of much sober argument
he was at last convinced of the trick that
had been played upon the memory of
his friend

   all right he admitted sadly  i
knowed they wuz somethin wrong atthe
time by the way they laughed they
haint no one thats all goot like the
general wuz i wislit i wuz with im

   oh no the deacon gently remon-
strated from the depths of a sudden ab-

then he sat bolt upright and with the matchless strength of his arms alone

rowed in a cunning frenzy

  he forgot all about the shooting and
peering round soon discovered the new
location of the tent the two approached
it and found its owner at home he of
course greeted them with his old-time
curses

   who writ that epytaft  the deacon
demanded

  after a long silence bob declared that
though it was nobodys business mr
jack renfro had been kind enough and
fair enough to give the general his due

straction  you want to go to a better
place than that

  then after a silence he roused bright-
ly and pursued  you jist come on out
on the bar with jack an me an shoot
awhile an iorgit your troubles when
we git back well write somethin suitable
fur burkett

   couldnt ye do it now 

   we better be a git tin to the point
the deacon replied as glancing out along
the spit he saw geese and ducks already


the railroad mans magazine

swarming in above it  the shootin is
a goin to be somethin wonderful we
kin write t at any time git yer gun
an come

   nope i guess not id rather set
an think

  moralizing the pair hurried to the
river bank down it and thence over the
wide stretches of dead water

  out on the very point of the bar the
old man and the son dug their pits has-
tily put out their decoys between
the pits and the edge of the sands where
the black waters of the main channel
crinkled and sucked by and then with
their faces set toward the shore across
they waited the return of the flock

  presently rain began to fall and the
wind that had been fresh and strong
now rose until it boomed mightily over
the great valley at that the birds
blinded and beaten hurtled in never-end-
ing swarms overhead and swept down
confusedly for the shelter of the spit
the deacon and his son stood up load-
ing and firing with all their speed and
skill and in the mad excitement of the
sport forgot all else

  it was just about noon that the clouds
suddenly parted the wind fell and the
sun came out brightly and the birds all
flew away the hunters stared across
the river noted the wondrous lustre with
which the farther shore shone and then
discovered that the waters had risen

  with a profound sigh for this meant
an end of the sport the old man turned
his head to look back over the way very
humanly anticipating his regret at de-
parture and was attempting to solace
himself with a bit of philosophy con-
cerning the brightness that comes after a
storm when on a sudden he gave vent
to an exclamation strangely vehement
for a deacon

  the bar or rather a great portion of
it lying between them and the shore had
disappeared where before for many
years it had risen now a black tossing
of waters swept and at every moment
grew wider the missouri had changed
its course

  the two scrambled from their pits
and huddling together gazed with start-
ing eyes as whole acres of the sands
slipped down and sank away

  presently from the bank down which

they had scrambled in the morning a
skiff shot out it came with speed toward
them but the cutting waters also came
the man in it bent himself far forward
at each stroke and  then with braced
feet hurled his whole weight upon the
tether of iis arms and the oars with
never a splash went up and down like
the wings  of a flying bird like
a bird the boat skimmed on but engulf-
ment approached even swifter

  then he sat bolt upright and with
the matchless strength of his arms alone
rowed in a cunning frenzy till the oars
showed as but a rolling sheen and the
hull lifted until it seemed fairly to fly
whereat the two who watched whirled
up their caps and cheered migtily for
he was gaining now then when the
point  which they stood had fallen
away to a space no wider than an oar
length he swung the boat alongside

  with a choke in his throat the deacon
quavered  bob jones god almighty
is behind a man that kin row that way
but the boat wont hold us all

  for answer the boatman tumbled
weakly out and gripping the painter
tightly with both hands cried in a com-
manding fury  git in git in won-
dering what further marvel of his craft
he would display whereby three men
might ride to safety in a boat designed
to bear but one they blindly obeyed him

  then he said  i couldnt a got to ye
with the big skift but thisll will float
ye till ye hit some bank he flung the
rope into the narrow prow and with a
sturdy kick on the gunwale shoved off

  they caught the oars and wielded
with all their strength to win back to
him but in the heart of the main chan-
nel of the missouri at flood-time the
currents are mighty when at last they
faced the bow about a score of boat
lengths separated them from the dwind-
ling circle at his feet

  from it he hailed simply  they is
no use men three would sink the skift
an no man could live in this water even
with a hang holt at the stei - let- er
drift fur fear o ice cakes floatin down

  then the last of the sands slowly
settled and the dark and swift flood
swept them remorselessly from view but
around him it seemed to rise gently and
gently it bore him down
great american train
robberies

by john p duxter

we are able to add no  to our series of great american train rob-
beries it is a startling gripping story strange as it may seem it
didnt happen in the far west where the doughty deeds of modern
dick turpins have added so much to history it occurred in pennsylvania-
the keystone state of this gentle-mannered effete east

    the spot selected was ideal the night was dark and rainy the
scheme was well planned the robber was a cool calculating desperado
nothing in the history of train-robberv reads more graphically

no -the lone bandit of the  pennsy

he just missed getting away with over  but the total
amount of his haul was exactly  in
lincoln pennies

  only the most colossal nerve aided
by equally unusual luck made possible
this latest exploit it is significant that
even after all the deviltry that marked
the palmy days of the old-timers had
been resurrected this robber in the
heart of civilization got away finally
with exactly sixty-five dollars in nice
new lincoln cents 	i

  never on the lonely plains of the
far west was a train held up and
looted in a bolder or more sensational
manner than was the pittsburgh and
northern express  the pennsylvania
railroad early in the morning of
august  never was a lone and
audacious robber more wofully sold than
the man who pulled off this job - he
actually missed getting over half a mil-
lion dollars

  most amazing in many ways of all
the fourteen  great american train
robberies told in the railroad
mans magazine is this the fifteenth
and final story in the series here al-
most under our very eyes is pulled off
one of the last if not the last of the
big deeds of daring of the road-agents
of the rail for meanwhile the gentle
art of train-robbery is passing into de-
cline and fall and the figures of jesse

a purpose threading its serpentine
course in and out among the mountains
of pennsylvania the juniata river is
closely paralleled by the pennsylvania
railroad

  it is one of the most wildly beautiful
spots in the alleghenies for miles on
this side of the river not a house is to
be found though the narrows is only
fifty-three miles from harrisburg the
state capital on one side is the river 
on the other are the mountains rising
abruptly and forming a deep narrow
gorge

  old residents of the section on either
side of the narrows recall that the point
at which the express was held up was
the scene of numerous highway robberies
in the days when david lewis and his
band operated in the mountains around
lewistown and bellelonte lhe old
state pike from philadelphia to pitts-
burgh passed through the lewistown
narrows where the tracks of the penn-
sylvania railroad now run and lewis
and his highwaymen frequently held up
stage-coaches bound east or west

  they continued to operate from 
to  when lewis and his chief lieu-
tenant connolly were captured and shot
by a posse and the gang dispersed
since then for nearly ninety years no
highwayman had dared operate there
thats how daring was this modern
hold-up

  had the highwayman been the most
artistic of theatrical managers instead of
a vagabond but pretty well educated for-
eigner as he seems to have been he
could not more excellently have staged
and carried out his plot

a criminals paradise

  the narrows is a rift between the
mountains some ten miles in length and
not much over an eighth of a mile in
width with piles upon piles of loose
jagged rocks covered with underbrush
and known under the name of  black
log mountain

  beside the juniata river an artificial
bed has been formed for the railroad
tracks to rest upon at many points
there is a sheer descent of thirty or
forty feet straight into the river - bed
there is only room for the towpath of

the pennsylvania canal and the old
state road between this and the abrupt
ascent of  j acks  mountain one of
the highest-and most rugged in that sec-
tion of the state

  the lofty mountains more even than
the tangled scrub timber cast deep
heavy shadows over the tracks at this
point until in the daytime except when
the sun is overhead they are of almost
stygian darkness there is absolutely
no life in the vicinity after sunset ex-
cept the seminightly trips of the track-

carried over 

  train no  has the reputation
among railroad men who know of being
a treasure-train nightly it carries from
 to  other trains carry
more money and valuables than this
but after all no  is a pretty regular
carrier of large sums at this particular
time it was a richer haul than ordi-
narily

  the pittsburgh and northern ex-
press as it is known to the public leaves
philadelphia shortly after  pm and
harrisburg at  on the night of
august  it was composed of five
pullman sleepers filled with passengers
and three express cars two of which
had come up from washington in the
afternoon and had been transferred to
the train at philadelphia while the
other was from that city itself

  in one of the washington express-
cars were five big steel safes crammed
full of rifew bank-notes in the denomi-
nations mostly of ones twos and fives
-perhaps something over half a million
dollars

  in the philadelphia express-car were
shipments of money and bullion to
banks farther west as well as checks
and valuable papers to an unknown
amount no one except the treasury
officials in washington and st louis
knew the combination of the five big
safes but the express messenger in the
other car knew that of the smaller safe
in which the smaller amounts of bullion
and coin were placed
great american train robberies



  at this particular season of the year
when the east was hurrying  crop
money  to the west to facilitate the
handling of the harvests the train was
likely to be a particularly rich haul
moreover it was the thirty-first of the
month and usually there was also on
this day over  in the pay-en-
velopes of the cambria steel company
of johnstown for september i

cars all this the robber must pre-
sumably have known when he deter-
mined on this dark and overcast night
to hold up no 

donnelly hears the torpedo

  it was about  am and the train
was running along smoothly at about
fifty miles an hour when suddenly en-

there was no answer-just the two eloquent open mouths of the automatics

  it so happened however that on this
night the pay-roll had been delayed to a
later train but the robber must have
known a lot about the inside as the gang
did in the famous mineral range hold-
up some years before on this train
it had always been the practise to have
a guard with a loaded repeating rifle in
the coach behind the express-cars

  it was his duty to get out and patrol
the treasure-car whenever a stop was
made but this had been discontinued
and the messengers and baggagemen
now relied on the carbines in their own

gineer samuel donnelly heard what
sounded like a torpedo under his engine

  he pulled back the throttle and fol-
lowing the rules after slowing down
proceeded under control then came
another explosion more violent than the
iirst and a whole series of them shat-
tering the head-light and breaking the
windows of the cab

  he turned on the emergency-brakes
and the wheels were clamped tightly
while the train came to an abrupt stop

donnelly peered out into the darkness
ahead fully expecting to see a wreck


the railroad mans magazine

  instead a gruff voice from behind
him rang out sharply 

   get down out of there  quick 
donnelly turned hastily only to find
himself facing the cold blue yawning
mouths of two automatic revolvers if
they were pointed at you you would
tremble if even a fly walked over the
trigger-the kind that will send half a
dozen bullets into you in as many
seconds

  behind the automatics was a grotesque
figure it was apparently that of a
short stockily built but very muscular
man from beneath his black slouch-
hat a gunny sack hung down covering
his face and even most of his body

  slits were cut in it through which his
piercing black eyes snapped sharply
even the burlap did not tone down the
rapid fire of profanity which blazed
from his mouth

  donnelly hustled down to the ground
as the robber also leaped off the steps
of the locomotive

  just then the fireman freeman g d

 willis came around the engine he
 had stepped out at the first sign of
 trouble to see if anything was wrong
 with the engine he hadnt time to
 report that the headlight had been
 smashed

hands up be quick about it
yelled the highwayman firing a few
shots just for the moral effect  if
either of you sav a word before  tell
you ill kill you both

 then followed a brief parley

 anv mail-cars

  no

  any express-cars  

 yes

  anv money  

  no

  you lie lead me back to them
 and be careful 

 fortunately the car containing the
 safes with the half million dollars was
 the second in the train the first car
 contained the single safe with the
 smaller amount the engineer was
 forced to beat on the door john w

everything that looked like money went into the bag
great american train robberies



the robber had chosen the pennies

s harper the express messenger
opened it

   whats the matter up the line he
drawled not for a moment dreaming of
such a thing as train-robbery in penn-
sylvania

  there was no answer-just the two
eloquent open mouths of the automatics
harper started back to the carbines in
the corner then stopped as if frozen

  if you move again before i tell you
to ill blow you up up with your
hands  yelled the robber  see those
dynamite cartridges in my pocket too
eh  

lined up the crew

  no one cared to trifle with the walk-
ing arsenal of death after that with
the utmost alacrity the engineer and fire-
man jumped up under orders into the
car while the robber followed and lined
up all three in the corner farthest from
the carbines

  just then the messenger from one of
the other cars t m clayton stuck his
head in the door to find out what was
up he didnt even have time to ask

his question but was expeditiously lined
up by the side of the other three

  the road-agent hadnt really got down
to business before up came i r poffen-
berger the conductor of the train swing-
ing his lantern and calling out to know
why the train was stopped

   throw up your hands and get back
there  answered the bandit adding an
argument from one of his revolvers while
he kept the other slowly swinging back
and forth on a level with the fifth ribs
of the four men lined up in the car be-
fore him

  the first shot went through poffen-
bergers hand and as he ducked and
ran a veritable broadside followed him
 by a miracle the shots went through
his coat-tails and nqt through him but
so far as the men in the car knew he
was dead as a door-riail

  at any rate the highwayman had
shown his quality-he was ready to fire
at a hostile eye-wink then he pro-
ceeded to take advantagt of the few
minutes he had in which to do his real
work

  under his directions while the fire-
man held open a sack harper was


the railroad mans magazine

forced to open the safe and take out the
contents as the highwayman inspected
 each bag he determined whether to take
it or not ordering harper to place it in
the bag which willis held

   some bags of bullion went in then
 some bags of currency and some pack-
 ages of papers that looked as if they
 might be bank-notes bundles pre-
 sumably of jewelry were discarded as
 too bulky but everything that looked
 like money went into the capacious maw
 of the bag that willis held

 right heah is whar he broke his
merlasses jug as uncle remus put it

   while no one knew the combinations
 of the five safes of the other car the
 bandit might have dynamited them and
 got a chance at half a million in the
 car he entered he mistook the heavy
 bags of uncoined bullion for coin the
 bags of what seemed to be gold coin
 were really nothing but lincoln pennies

    as for the packages that seemed to be
 treasury-notes they contained nothing
 but checks and commercial paper the
 whole thing made a heavy bundle more
 than he could quickly andconveniently
 carry in his hurry to get away and start
 the train off again

   in fact the pennies themselves-some
 eleven thousand of them-weighed over
 seventy pounds and after you drop the
 two decimals off they werent much of
 a haul at that

up the mountainside

    pick up that bag  he ordered
 willis when it was evident that the safe
 had been thoroughly looted and that the
 time was growing short

   now carry it up this path he
 added

   then as the fireman preceded him up
 the mountainside he turned to the en-
 gineer

     now you go back to the engine and
 dont you stop till you get to the next
 station 

   after a few minutes climb fireman
 willis was told to drop his burden in
 a thicket

     good night and good luck said the
 bravado  get back to your train if
 you can i hope to see you again 

willis was only too glad to return on

a run and more than glad to just
scramble aboard thfe train donnelly
had been much too cautious to run his
train out blindly but had reconnoitered
the track for several yards ahead find-
ing near the rails a quantity of dyna-
mite large enough to blow up thetrain
provided he had not stopped just when
he did after the second explosion

  indeed the bandit had intimated that
if anything went wrong he wouldnt
hesitate to blow up the train not five
days later in another part of the state
yeggmen dynamited a train on another
road for the purpose of concealing a
robbery

the passengers sleep

  while all this rapid-fire excitement
was taking place up at the head of the
train only three or four of the most
wakeful of the passengers in the sleep-
ers had the slightest inkling of what
was going on some were for going
ahead with conductor poffenberger and
putting up a fight but most of them
dived back into their berths and got
exceedingly busy secreting their money
and valuables in unlikely places so as
to be protected if the trouble extended
back into their cars

  but the majority of the passengers
didnt know a thing about it until they
reached pittsburgh the next morning and
reporters approached them for accounts
of the hold-up the train was delayed
so short a time by the hold-up that it
came in practically on time

  at the first tower  station donnelly
had stopped long enough to telegraph
the news train no  held up
masked bandit lewistown narrows
 this morning loss slight

  within an hour a posse on a special
train was on its way from the division
headquarters to the narrows followed
later by willis the pinkertons had
been notified and were on their way
the state constabulary bad sent out or-
ders to look for the robber local and
long-distance telephones were buzzing
all over the state telegraphs were
spreading the news to every flag-station
and the newspapers were hurrying the
story over the land

with the first break of light in the
great american train robberies



lewiston narrows pennsylvania the scene of the last great robbery

east the side of the mountain was liter-
ally alive with searchers suddenly a
shout of joy rang out only a few hun-
dred feet away from the spot where the
fireman had dropped the sack a bag
had been picked up it was heavy and
the searchers expected to find in it the
pennies

  they literally yelled when they saw
it was the bag of bullion the robber
had made another blunder and had
chosen the bag of pennies rather than
the uncoined gold

  a few hundred yards farther was
found a bag half full of pennies-the
seal intact but the bag slit with a knife
handfuls of bright new lincoln cents
lay scattered in every direction

  boys were set to work picking them
up and all but about six thousand five
hundred were recovered even those
made quite a load

  after the trail of pennies ended
little further was found except the torn
and discarded envelopes of papers and
the gunny-sack with the eye-slits

  even when bloodhounds kept for this
very purpose by the b and o at chil-

licothe ohio had been brought to the
scene and had picked up the scent it
was soon lost

  the highwayman had disappeared as
completely as if the darkness had swal-
lowed him the wide-flung net about
the scene never gathered him in in spite
of the score- of dogs and over two hun-
dred officers and citizens

  and so as usual it was the little
fatal mistakes after the big work had
been done successfully that prevented
one of the most daring hold-ups in the
history of american railroading from
being a complete success until it ac-
tually happened no railroad or express
official would have believed such a thing
within the range of possibility on the
roadway of any of the great eastern
trunk lines

   there lias been nothing like it to
occur on any eastern railway in some
twenty-five years said one official
 it wont occur again in twenty-five
more possibly we have fostered the be-
lief that such a thing could not be done
here in the east and were not looking
for wild-west episodes

 came effective at once

   the policy of the
 bureau was to be de-
 termined and its busi-
 ness conducted by an
 executive board con-
 sisting of the chair-
 man or commissioners
 of the several terri-
 torial passenger asso-
 ciations it was not
 realized at that time
 how strongly the
 scalper was entrenched

           series began in october

nor the magnitude of the work to be
accomplished in the elimination of these
self-constituted railroad ticket-agents

   the policy of the bureau was similar
to that of the american bankers asso-
ciation and the jewelers security alli-
ance no let-up  any suit commenced
no compromise of any kind but simply
constant and vigorous prosecution when-
ever and wherever sufficient evidence of
lawlessness had been secured

                    the first year was
                  devoted to securing
                  data and information
                  showing the extent
                  of the frauds prac-
                  tised by the scalpers
                  instructing conductors
                  how to examine rail-
                  road tickets to detect
                  manipulations etc

fighting the ticket - scalpers

  these men were sent to the larger
cities and often obtained employment in
scalpers offices thus being able to render
daily reports advising the bureau of the
frauds perpetrated by these people

  through this systematic supervision
the bureau was soon in possession of the
necessary information with which to
wage a successful warfare against this
illegal traffic

  it was found necessary to secure the

  the membership lines of the bureau
were advised by circular letters of irregu-
larities discovered and suggestions were
made to them how to safeguard their
tickets where a ticket was in use that
could be easily altered by scalpers its
withdrawal and the substitution of one
more difficult to manipulate was recom-
mended

out of tickets which would withstand

cooperation of the auditing departments
of the railroads so that altered tickets
found in collections would be sent to the
bureau with as little delay as possible

  it was soon learned that the majority
of altered rickets emanated from such
cities as atlanta indianapolis chicago
st louis buffalo kansas city denver
cincinnati san antonio and new or-
leans

  such altered tickets as came to the
notice of the bureau through the col-
lections of the railroads or through pur-
chases made at scalpers offices were care-
fully examined each alteration noted and
compared with manipulations in other
altered tickets and also with the reports
of the detectives employed by the bureau

checking up scalpers

  in this way the workmanship of the
different ticket  fixers  became fa-
miliar and distinct traces of them and
their work could be maintained

the acid tests and many other sugges-
tions of a like nature were urged blank
forms were prepared for the use of con-
ductors when altered tickets were found
in the hands of passengers these tick-
ets were  lifted

  the passenger was required to give
his name and address date of purchase
of ticket name and description of party
from whom ticket was purchased and
what rebate order if any

  the conductor also had to secure what-
ever statement a passenger was told to
make to a conductor what envelopes
cards papers or letters for purpose of
-identification a passenger presented to
what point baggage was checked on a
ticket whether the baggage was checked
by the passenger or another party also
getting a description of the ticket with
its number date etc

  many other suggestions were made and
adopted by the railroads and it was their
cooperation with the bureau in every
matter brought to their attention which


the railroad mans magazine

largely contributed to the great measure
of success achieved

  if any question ever existed as to the
necessity and expediency for such an or-
ganization as the protective bureau
its experience effectually dispelled the
doubt what the bureau was enabled to
discover in the extent and character of
the frauds which were boldly perpe-
trated by these lawless ticket - scalpers
should convince even the most skeptical

  perhaps the most profitable manner of
swindling the railroads was by altering
the destinations on tickets thereby en-
hancing their value

all writing removed

  for instance a ticket would be pur-
chased by the scalpers at the railroad
station reading over more than one rail-
road and requiring the issuance of two or
three coupons a skeleton form of ticket
-which is one whose coupons are in
blank-would be used to route the same
the names of the railroad line and the
destination being placed on it in writing
by the agent

  the scalper would submit the entire
ticket to a bath in certain liquids there-
by removing all trace of writing if
the ticket was tot much discolored by the
acid it would be dyed or recolored with
water-colors nd restored to its original
tint

  to further avoid detection it would 
be used on night trains only the ticket

would then be routed via some line which
would permit the longest possible haul
in this way often enhancing the value of
the ticket ten-fold

good around the world

  when one considers that a single cou-
pon frequently carries a passenger a
great distance as from chicago to al-
buquerque  and another from albu-
querque to california points it is easy to
see the enormous profits made
by the scalper from the sale
of tickets manipulated by
diis method

  the boast made by one of
the scalpers is apropos  give
me any kind of ticket with
enough coupons on it and i
will make it good to ride
around the world

  the plugging of expired
tickets examples of which
are shown in the illustrations
became so general that scalp-
ers thought nothing of it
the writer recalls an incident
to the point showing the ex-
tent of the moral perversion
among these scalpers when
one of them called on him and protested
against the surveillance maintained on
his office

  he claimed that he was absolutely
honest and never resorted to altering or
changing the destination of tickets but
at the same time admitting frankly that
expired tickets were plugged and sold
by him saying that every scalper did
this and it was not considered a dis-
honest practise

in the laundry

  it was considered good form and a
business necessity to have what is termed
a  laundry  in connection with every
ticket-scalping office this  laundry 
was a back room where the ticket or
pass received its final touches in altera-
tions

  it is a well-known fact that almost
every pass which found its way into the
hands of a scalper and which read
 good for john brown had the addi-
tion of  and wife  or  and sister 

that it is fitting they were put to an end

  if a call came for three persons
to use the pass the addition  and
daughter or and son was made

the railroad companies no doubt
would now be carrying entire bat-
talions on this class of transporta-
tion if mr scalper had not been
suppressed

  lost or stolen annual passes is-
sued to railroad employees of dif-
ferent lines found their way to
the scalpers who made a specialty
of this class of transportation

such a pass usually had the name
of the person to whom issued type-
written on its face all trace of writing
would be removed the number of the
pass would be changed and it would
then be made to read for john brown
and seven men  on account of  adver-
tising  or  construction

large profits made

  parties of six or seven people would
be made up and the pass placed in the
hands of one of the creatures or em-
ployees of the crooked scalper who would
accompany the passengers to their desti-
nation being careful to keep the pass in
his possession

  old stock expired tickets which
had accumulated in the hands of the
larger scalpers who were too conscien-

or sell them over their counters to their
customers but who were not too scrupu-
lous to dispose of them to other scalpers
would be eagerly competed and bid for
by the smaller fry

  in fact the saying became common
that  a ticket never expired in a scalp-
ers hands some of these buyers of
expired transportation traveled to smaller
cities where scalpers had been in business
for years and for a few dollars pur-
chased large numbers of such tickets

  even if some of them could not be
revived due to the fact that the year
calendar limits would not permit they
could always be used for matching or
plugging other tickets the paper of
which was the same color and the cou-
pons used to paste onto other con-
tracts-thus making one ticket out
of two

  the contract form giving the
year month and date calendars is
generally termed a  header and
represents the issuing line cou-
pons can of course be routed via
any line with which the contract-
ing lines has interline routing
agreements and therefore large
profits could be made by the use
of the coupons from the expired
tickets

  frequently through tickets are
canceled by the first conductor by
one or two punches in the lower
right-hand corner by the second
conductor in the middle of lower
part of ticket and are supposed
to be taken up by the third con-

ticket originally issued to short destination
of a value about  made to read from
kansas city to chicago chicago to
indianapolis and indianapolis to
monon thereby enhancing its
value to about l


the railroad mans magazine

ductor scalpers will send a ticket the
distance of the first conductors run re-
ceive the ticket back by mail showing
but one cancellation in lower right-hand
corner

  with their shears they will cut off this
cancellation and send the ticket out for
a second run if the cancellation can-
not be removed in this way it is altered
by the aid of the  b c punch which
indicates that baggage has been checked

  this  b c punch usually obliterates
the conductors cancellation if this
cannot be done cancellations are prompt-
ly plugged and in this way two or three
and sometimes as high as ten rides over
the division of this conductor can be ac-
complished before the ticket is finally
sent through to its destination

more scheming

  to avoid the scrutiny of the gate-
keepers a ticket is purchased to some
short destination and presented at the
gate so as to permit the passenger to pass
through he is told to present the ticket
bearing the longer destination to the con-
ductor who supposing that it has passed
the scrutiny of the gatekeeper does not
give it as close an examination as he
should

  if the conductor is known to be care-
ful or  wise  to altered tickets the
scalper either avoids sending such ticket
over his run or furnishes the passenger
with a ticket to the end of the conduc-
tors run and instructs the passenger to
present the altered ticket to the second
conductor the scalper having first placed
proper cancellations on it to mislead the
second conductor into the belief that it
has passed the scrutiny of the first one

  to the layman who is unfamiliar with
the methods of railroading it would
seem impossible or unreasonable that
forged tickets could be used to such an
extent as to seriously affect the revenues
of the railroads

  it would be reasoned that inasmuch
as tickets are cancelled by the conductor
and turned into the auditing department
the fraud would be discovered at once
this is true provided the tickets always
reach the auditing departments but this
is not the case

one of the cleverest forgeries perpe-

trated in chicago a few years ago was
by the following method

  an entire forged ticket purporting to
be issued at some eastern point having
but one coupon to its destination via a
western railroad was extensively dealt
in by a gang of forgers who never sold
the ticket to its destination but to some
point short

rebate from passengers

  in other words they never permitted
the ticket to get into the hands of the
last conductor to cancel it they would
exact a rebate from the passenger draw
a sight draft on the bank in the town
where he was going for the amount of
the rebate and would at once send to
this bank the amount to be paid on de-
livery of the ticket the bank returning
the unused portion of the ticket to them
by mail

  so careful were they to whom they
sold this ticket that a prospective pur-
chaser would be shadowed during the
entire day by boys employed for the pur-
pose

  if the passenger in any way aroused
suspicion by entering one of the regular
railroad ticket-offices or a building
where one of the passenger associations
was located or could not give the names
of reputable citizens of chicago to vouch
for him the ticket would not be deliv-
ered to him

  it required considerable skill and pa-
tience to gather sufficient evidence with
which to successfully prosecute this gang
of forgers but it was finally accomplished
and they were sentenced to terms in the
penitentiary of illinois

  i recall quite vividly an instance in
the trial where one of them made the
claim that we could never produce evi-
dence to convict as they had been careful
not to sell to  stiffs -a  stiff  being
some one employed by the bureau to test
the scalpers

his waterloo

  this name was also given to any one
arousing suspicion a clerk would use
the words  stiff bat  in conversation
with a scalper to indicate that the party
trying to purchase a ticket was a spotter

    here are reproduced the stub and going and
 returning-coupons of a ticket issued by the louis-
 ville and nashville railroad april  s from
 nashville to louisville and return at one fare
 for the round trip the going portion of this
 ticket was properly used when the return por-
 tion appeared in the collections of the auditor
 it was discovered that the tint had been entire-
 ly removed from it and that the word cin-
 cinnati  had been substituted for the word
 louisville also that the return limit had
 been raised from may   to june  
 the action of the acids necessary to remove
 these names also destroyed the tint comparison
 also shows a difference in stamps of the word
  special

   at the trial in question the
 witnesses had been kept in the
 background but during the con-
 versation had with the scalper
 an elderly benign gentleman en-
 tered the court-room

   the scalper gave a horrified
 gasp and exclaimed  great
 heavens that isnt one of your
 witnesses is it 

     replied that it was

   he said  let me tell you

 that old man was passing my
 office one morning with a folder
 in his hands he looked so good
 to me that i asked him if he
 would not like to buy a cheap
 ticket he replied that he
 would that he was here visit-
 ing his daughter but that he in-
 tended to return to his home in
 minnesota the next night

    he was so unsophisticated
 apparently that i induced him
 to buy one of these  phoneys
 never even requiring him to pay
 a rebate but simply giving him
 an envelope directed to me in
 which to return the unused por-
 tion

    i gave him a lot of advice as
 to the many pitfalls of a great
 eity even going so far as to take
 him to the elevated railroad and
 showing him just how to reach
 his daughters the easiest way

 i surely got a hot one when i
 picked up this chap

   we are glad to state that this
 benevolent-looking old man made
 one of our best witnesses and
 aided materially in the conviction
 of the forgers

   there was considerable danger
 in the printing of an entire
 fraudulent issue of railroad tick-
 ets a safer but as profitable
 method was purchasing tickets to
 some short destination directly
 from the railroad companies this des-
 tination would then be erased and a
 destination to some point on a branch
 line close to a junction point would
 be printed on them the printing making
 the ticket appear more bona fide than
 writing would have done

   this junction point being where the
      r r

 conductors changed the ticket would re-
 main in the passengers hands merely
 showing the first conductors punches
 and he would pay cash fare from the
 junction point to his destination at the
 destination the ticket would be turned
 over to a confederate of the scalper and
 a small rebate paid the passenger the


the railroad mans magazine

ticket would be returned to the original
scalper who would use it again and
again after the cancellations had been
plugged

crooked scalpers organize

  the rebating of these forged tickets
necessitated some organization of the
crooked scalpers and what was known
as the american traveling brokers
association  was formed this organi-
zation had no offices or officers and its
only purpose was to hoodwink the travel-
ing public into the belief that they were
dealing with members of a legitimate
organization among the scalpers known
as the american ticket brokers asso-
ciation

  the members of the fake association
displayed membership certificates on
their walls to which they would point
when passengers hesitated about buying
a ticket saying  we are regular mem-
bers of the american brokers associa-
tion  we guarantee our transactions and
if anything should happen that this
transportation is not accepted we would
be compelled to refund your money

  these men in case of arrest and prose-
cution would flock to the aid of each
other many-would commit perjury with-
out the slightest hesitation approach
jurors during the progress of the trial
and in fact would do everything they
could to defeat the ends of justice

a special ink used

  one of the earliest impositions prac-
tised by the scalpers was that of using
volatile ink in signing tickets this ink
when dry could readily be removed by-
rubbing with a cloth or brush in pur-
chasing a round trip signature form of
ticket from the agent at the station the
passenger would be instructed to use a
fountain pen furnished by the scalper
containing this ink and to sign his name

lightly

  the ticket would then be used to
its destination the return portion rebated
at the scalpers agent who would prompt-
ly remove the signature as explained
placing thereon the name of some other
purchaser to whom he had sold this por-
tion of the ticket

  childrens tickets issued at half rate
or half tickets were another source of
profitable income the figure   
which had been cut out by a punch would
be plugged or if written in it would
be erased and in this way the ticket
could be made good for an adult

  one of the most flagranc swindles per-
petrated by the scalpers was that of in-
ducing passengers to use what they
termed the  fast stock express

  in a large city like chicago there are
many men who are temporarily stranded
and who are willing to ride in almost any
kind of car to reach their homes

  the scalpers had arrangements to fur-
nish helpers to a number of stockyard
agents who shipped cattle to eastern
points these helpers were required to
 punch up  the cattle that fell down
in the cars long poles were furnished
these helpers and the work was very
arduous

 fast stock express

  the scalper would tell a party who
came to him for a cheap ticket that he
would get him home for a small sum
he would of course have to ride on the
 fast stock express but that it only
took some three or four hours longer
than the passenger - trains to make the
ti ip furthermore he would have a de-
lightful journey and could rest in the
caboose which was almost as comfort-
able as a sleeping-car

  after separating the unsophisticated
one from his money a trip would be made
to the stock-yards the man turned over
to the agent and the profits divided the
agent would put the man in the caboose
and after the train left the city the vic-
tim would be handed a long pole and
told to work

  if he refused he would promptly hit
the gravel  some two or three hundred
miles away

  it frequently happened that more vic-
tims were secured than could be accom-
modated on these stock-trains but this
did not deter the scalpers from taking
the money for the  fast stock express

  one night a polish hebrew was found
sitting disconsolately in an empty caboose
at the stock-yards the night-watchman
asked him what he was doing he said
fighting the ticket-scalpers



he was waiting for the train to start
that he had paid his money to a ticket-
scalper who had put him aboard the
caboose which he could not be induced
to leave until the police were called

  he afterward endeavored to get his
money back from the scalper but was
compelled to sue the case was aired
in all the newspapers at the time many
letters of complaint were received by the
scalpers from their victims whom they
had induced to take this journey which
they read to each other with merriment

  the railroads thought that they had
solved the problem of avoiding manipu-
lations and alterations of tickets when
they instituted what is called a train
check all tickets presented on trains
were at once taken in charge by the con-
ductor and train checks were issued in
this way a ticket was at once turned over
to the auditors

train checks useless

  it was found however that the
scalpers were as expert in forging these
train checks as they were in forging
tickets entire issues of them were
counterfeited and the same methods
were used to prevent their falling into
the hands of the auditors as in the case
of tickets the following clever method
was evolved by a denver scalper

  a train check bearing a thirty-day
limit reading from denver to chicago
would come into his hands he would
sell forged train checks bearing this
same number as far as kansas city
having them mailed back to him by an
associate on whom it was rebated

  he continued to issue forged train
checks during the entire month bearing
the same number as the original the
numbers being placed on with a number-

ing machine in this way he could keep
a train check working every day bearing
the same number but if by chance the
forged train check was not mailed back
to him he would cease using that number
immediately

  the forged check going to the audi-
tors would check up with the envelope
from which the original had been taken
and of course would be found correct
thousands of dollars were lost to the
railroads by this method before it was
exposed and the guilty scalper prose-
cuted

worked even when insane

  such in brief were the miscreants
the protective bureau were pitted
against it found them bold because
they had so long been undisturbed in
their vocation it found them skilful
because their calling required skill it
found them hardened in their vicious
practises but in the end it invariably
found them cowardly and cringing when
brought face to face with the law

  a certain scalper one of the cleverest
ticket-forgers in the country was em-
ployed by a st louis scalper solely for
the purpose of altering and forging
tickets his work became well known
and the constant fear of arrest and prose-
cution together with the close confine-
ment day after day and month after
month shattered his health and he be-
came a nervous wreck finally he was
taken to an insane asylum where he died
it is said that during the time he was
in the asylum the only thing that would
quiet him was to give him pieces of
colored paper some paste and the tools
of a ticket-forger with which he would
contentedly work under the delusion that
he was still altering railroad tickets

the third and last article in mr koachs series will appear in our december number
it will deal with the methods by which the dishonest scalpers were finally put out of business

chapter i
a fight in the bay

erhaps it was because i
was raised inland that the
boat interested me i stood
at the edge of the dock ten
feet above the surface of the
water looking down at it
intently of course i had seen skiffs on
the park ponds and larger rowboats 
the inland rivers but never such a row-
boat as this-a craft where twenty men
could work at the oars and wide enough
to permit a line of passengers between
the rowers

  it was shaped peculiarly too - cut
away at the bov to permit a speedy pas-
sage through the water low amidships
raised high the stern this high stern
fascinated me and i caught myself won-
dering why it should have been built
so i was to learn within an hour just
why and to give thanks that it was so

  almost before i realized it it was
dark i took my eyes from the boat and
looked out upon san francisco bay a
short distance away a brilliantly lighted
man-of-war rode at anchor out toward
the golden gate red and green lights
told where a tramp steamer was anchored
the boat below me belonged to the
tramp steamer i knew that much for
i had seen it leave the steamer three
hours before

  i had watched fascinated as the
regular long sweep of the oars carried
it across the water toward the dock from
a distance i had watched the men disem-
bark-a crew of tough-looking ruffians
i thought at the time the majority of
them foreigners jabbering some foreign

tongue their hands and faces seamed by
rough work and living and red from con-
tact with sun and wind and sea they
had gone up one of the narrow side-
streets leaving one of their number be-
hind to guard the boat

  i had watched too as this fellow
paced back and forth restlessly mutter-
ing to himself evidently chagrined be-
cause he could not join his companions
in their revel or work whatever it was
that had brought them ashore after
an hour had passed he had slipped away
into another side-street perhaps to some
resort and at the time i stood above
their boat as night was falling none
of them had returned-

  it came to my mind suddenly that my
interest in things which were new to me
had dulled my common sense that it was
already far past the dinner - hour and
that my uncle would be anxious concern-
ing my whereabouts

   it would be better to explain here and
now that my uncle is richard engle the
famous explorer a month before he
had visited my mother and me in our
home town in indiana and had enter-
tained us with tales of adventure in for-
eign lands

  he announced that it was necessary
for him to make a trip to san francisco
on business and i begged to be allowed
to go along my mother had consented
that was how i came to be looking fool-
ishly down  this wonderful boat in
san francisco harbor

  everything interested me during the
ride to the coast but it was after i
reached the sea that my real interest was
aroused for a week i had made daily
pilgrimages to the bay there to sit on


the railroad mans magazine

the dock and watch the ships come and
go load and unload arrive from and
depart for the uttermost parts of the
earth

  this was the first time however that
i had failed to return to the hotel by six
oclock  decided that i should return
at once and never remain away so late
again  remembered too that uncle
dick had tickets for the theater and
if i did not hurry we should be late at
the play

  as i turned to go up the dock toward
the street there came a babel of cries
behind me the rush of many feet
screams and curses and a shot it
seemed that my heart stood still i was
utterly unable to move for the din was
one to strike terror to the heart of a boy
unused to such events

  before i could step to one side the
rush of men was upon me in the dark-
ness i could not see much could only
realize that the men were those i had
seen come ashore in the boat below me
they bad been drinking evidently and
had had trouble with the police for they
seemed highly excited and cried to each
other loudly and rushed toward the boat
intent only upon getting in her and get-
ting away

  the rush came so quickly that there
was no time for me to escape

  half a dozen men hurled themselves
against me i felt my feet slip felt my-
self falling through space gave a scream
that was not heard in that unearthly din
struck against something hard with such
force that the breath was knocked out
of me before i could regain my feet
half a dozen men were upon me falling
fighting screaming struggling to get
at the oars

  other men sprang down upon us
sprawled to their positions cried out to
each other in voices of anger and fear
i realized dimly that one man was fight-
ing as though to regain his liberty that
his clothes were half torn from his body

  i saw an oar lifted saw it descend
saw this man who fought rendered sense-
less by the blow i had not seen his
face yet i had seen enough to convince
me that he was not like the others but
was american or english

  some one gave a command in a loud
voice and then t realized for the first

time that i had been thrust into the big
boat at the foot of the dock by mistake
and that the boat was rushing through
the water- as fast as the rowers could
send it

  on the dock there was another chorus
of cries

   stop stop or well fire  screamed
a voice

  the men in the boat began cursing
again i heard shots saw flashes of
fire back at the dock heard bullets
whistle by instinctively i flinched and
got down as low as possible in the bot-
tom of the boat

  two men who were not rowing began
to fire in return then a regular battle
began between the men in the boat and
the men on the dock and all the time
the cursing rowers pulled at their oars
rushing the big boat through the water

  directly in front of me a man
screamed threw his hands above his
head and toppled to one side one of
the men who had been firing at the
dock sprang to the vacant place the
wounded man was kicked aside

  i had been unable so far to make my
presence known and now fear clutched
at my heart for such brutality was new
to me and i began to avonder what my
fate would be at the hands of these men

  i decided to remain in hiding as long
as possible to wait until my presence
in the boat was discovered and then
tell a truthful story and trust to their
mercy or the mercy of their commander
the men on the dock were still firing
but the men in the boat had ceased to
reply to their fire

  near the stern there was a pile of
canvas and toward this i crept as cau-
tiously as possible owing to the dark-
ness and excitement no one saw me

   as i reached the pile of cloth i noticed
for the first time that a motor-boat was
coining after us swiftly and wondered
whether it was endeavoring to overtake
us i was not to remain in doubt long
for as the motor-boat approached some
one in it commanded our boat to stop
and upon getting no answer opened fire

  i crept beneath the canvas my heart
was pounding at my ribs our boat
stopped and the firing became heavier
all the rowers were using their weapons
now
the daughter of the idol



  presently the boat shot forward again
i put my head from beneath the canvas
the lights of the motor-boat were far
astern the men in it had been slain
or had retreated before the heavy fire
i could tell by the lights that the motor-
boat was putting back toward the shore

  then i looked ahead and saw that
we were near the tramp steamer as
we drew nearer some one from the
steamer hailed some one from our boat
answered we drew alongside and the
men scrambled over each other in a
frenzied effort to get on deck

  by peering from beneath the pile of
sail-cloth i saw the two men handed up
-the sailor who had been shot and the
other man who had been rendered sense-
less by a blow from an oar

  there were quick demands from some
one who spoke in a tone of authority
i hid beneath the canvas again for the
boat was being swung to the deck of the
steamer

  my sensations at that moment were
unpleasant and i shall not attempt to
describe them it seemed that even be-
fore the boat i was in had reached the
deck the steamer was under way and
rushing down the bay toward the golden
gate

  my terror increased i was on a ship
leaving port bound i knew not where
companion to men -whose appearance be-
spoke them brutes and who were evi-
dently at outs with law-abiding people
what was to become of me what
would my uncle think

  i peered from beneath the canvas
again crawled out and raised my head
cautiously until i could look down at the
deck a group of men stood beneath a
light before the forward mast

  in the center of the group upon the
deck was the body of a man-the man
who had been struck with the oar one
of the sailors was dashing water in his
face another was holding liquor to his
lips

  he seemed to regain consciousness
then struggled to his feet quickly and
faced toward me the sailors holding
back his arms so that he could do no
harm as he faced the one i took to be
the ships captain the light fell full
upon him

  i gave a cry that would have betrayed

me but for the throbbing of the ships
engines and the roar of the wind through
the rigging

  the man on the deck below clothes
half torn from him his face covered
with blood and dirt his eyes flashing
angrily-was uncle dick

chapter ii
under fire

co great was my astonishment that i
lifted myself half over the gunwale
of the boat trying to see and to hear
then i realized my position and be-
came more cautious

  the steamer was rushing down the
bay toward the harbor entrance the
black smoke pouring from her stack far
behind another vessel rushed after us
evidently a police tug or a revenue cut-
ter i saw all this at a glance then
gave my entire attention to the scene on
the deck below me

  uncle dick was still struggling with
the men who held him and as i watched
his struggling ceased and i knew from
the look in his face that he felt this was
a time for cunning rather than brute
force

 what is the meaning of this out-
rage i heard him demand what
ship is this where is her commander 
the man i had taken to be captain
stepped nearer uncle dick and laughed

   this is a steamer that changes its
name whenever it pleases the skipper
he said  the skipper changes his name
as often as he pleases also at present
this is the steamer faraway and i am
captain hawson

   why was i decoyed to the water-
front and there seized and made pris-
oner and carried aboard this craft my
uncle demanded again  if you have
made a mistake in the man it would be
better to right it instantly

  your name is richard engle de-
manded captain hawson

  if it is what follows 

    well if it is it follows that there
has been no mistake the captain re-
plied with his evil grin

  my uncle shook himself free of the
two sailors who held him and took a
step forward facing captain hawson


the railroad mans magazine

   will you tell me why i am on this
ship he demanded

  do you not know the captain
asked

   most certainly i do not where is
this ship bound

   the port is not on the charts said
the captain laughing

   i demand that you answer me 

   demand away  cried captain
hawson  you are not going to whip
my entire crew and force an explanation
are you 

  there was no mistaking the venom in
the captains voice my uncle turned
and glanced around him at the evil faces
glowering at him

   a splendid collection of thugs  he
cried  you must have scraped the
slums of the world to get them 

  evidently some of the men understood
english for there were quick murmurs
among them and two or three started
toward him but captain hawson
raised a hand in warning

   dont touch him  he cried  ill
shoot down the first man who raises a
hand against mr engle

  uncle dick whirled upon him

  so he cried laughing himself
 that is the way matters stand you
have walked into my little trap you
have not decoyed me aboard the faraway
for purposes of your own then but are
only an agent for some one else

   very well if you have orders to
deliver me a prisoner at a certain port
be sure that you carry out your orders

   well carry out the orders all right
answered the captain angrily

   and in the meantime no matter how
nasty i get you will see that i am not
harmed-is that it i am worth money
to you if delivered to a certain port
alive and worth nothing to you if dead
is that it now we understand each
other

   perhaps we do not said the cap-
tain

   youll not tell me the ships destina-
tion 

   not at present

  i am to make myself at home aboard
i suppose

   you are to be made comfortable
but do not try any tricks captain haw-
son warned  you might as well take it

easy i have nothing to do but capture
and deliver you im not supposed to
torture you the torture i understand
will come later

  again the captain smiled that evil
smile and turned to give some orders to
one of the crew my uncle brushed back
the hair from his brow and looked ahead
toward the golden gate

   my dear captain he said  you are
perhaps forgetting that your men cre-
ated something of a disturbance while
capturing me you are perhaps unaware
that the police knew something was
wrong that i was able to call out to
them that i was being abducted it is
just possible that there is trouble in store
for you there is a tug following

   the tug will scarcely overtake us
once we are upon the sea the captain
said

   it is possible that the fortifications
at golden gate have been warned
uncle dick said  they may be on the
outlook for you

   a ship has the right to leave port
sir the captain thundered

   not at night without proper clear-
ance papers especially when her skipper
and crew run away from the police

   i am not worrying about the fortifi-
cations the captain said

   then there are revenue cutters

    theyll have to hurry to catch us

   perhaps you are used to evading the
authorities my uncle insinuated

  captain hawson walked nearer to
him

   perhaps i have had some little ex-
perience in that line he admitted and
perhaps your talking about it will do no
good suppose we let the matter drop
for the time being

   willingly my uncle replied  es-
pecially as you are to lie busy with other
things for the present

  what do you mean the captain
asked

   there 

  i saw uncle dick point to port from
one of the splendid fortifications which
guard san franciscos harbor a long
bright finger of light shot out and illu-
minated the bay back and forth it
swept resting for a couple of seconds
upon every vessel it spotted they were
sweeping the bay with searchlights
the daughter of the idol



  captain hawson issued orders quickly
before he had concluded the search-
light rested upon the faraway followed
it made every inch of the ship as light
as day

  the faraway continued on her course
behind us the tug gave sharp quick
whistles imperative commands lor us
to stop captain hawson gave them no
attention

  i heard the report of a heavy gun and
realized that the fort was issuing a com-
mand of its own still the steamer con-
tinued  her way other searchlights
flashed out from the other fortifications
the narrow harbor entrance was as light
as light could make it

  there came another shot from the
fort -more whistles from the following
tug then the whistle of the faraway
spoke loud and clear like a human
being demanding to know what the row
was about i saw two of the men run
aft saw them unfurl the stars and
stripes to the breeze then the faraway-
whistled again and kept on

   but the forts were not satisfied there
was another report and a shell screamed
past ahead of the steamer instead of
stopping she put on more speed and
dashed into the entrance

  searchlights flashed angrily the pur-
suing tug continued her staccato whis-
tling  heard the report of another
gun heard something strike saw a blind-
ing flash and heard a deafening roar

  the fort had done with nonsense
the shell had struck the deck and a
splinter had evidently smashed into some
part of the boat in which i was con-
cealed cries told me that some one had
been injured throwing caution to the
winds i raised my head above the side
of the boat and peered down

  two men were wounded upon the
deck captain hawson was cursing and
crying out orders at the top of his voice
uncle dick stood beside the mast one
hand upon it smiling at the scene

   perhaps you had better stop the
steamer i heard him say

  captain hawson looked keenly down
the narrow illuminated strait for a mo-
ment then smiled queerly he shouted
an order and slowly the ships engines
quieted their throbbing and she stopped
a confident smile crossed uncles face

   so you have concluded that discre-
tion is the part of valor that appeals
most to you just now  he said

   exactly answered the captain
strangely undisturbed  i hate to waste
united states powder almost as much
as  hate to run the gantlet when there is
an easier way to escape

  scarcely had he finished before it was
apparent what he meant the vanguard
of a dense sea-fog was already creeping
over the bow and turning the white
searchlight to a dirty yellow soon the
daylike glare had become an elusive
scarce visible smear and to sight a gun
upon any object in the golden gate
would have been an absolute impossi-
bility a sharp triumphant order came
from captain hawson and the faraway
dashed recklessly on and on courting
destruction every moment but with the
luck of daring she gained the open sea

chapter iii

i meet a lady

rfwo men sprang forward to carry out
captain hawsons command to cut
away the wrecked boat in which i lay
i felt the ropes give as they worked at
them we were outside the range of the
searchlights now and it was almost pitch
dark save where the light from the mast
cast its narrow reflection

  while the men worked at the ropes
below i slipped as near the deck as pos-
sible undecided whether to show myself
or to make an attempt at escape the
sea decided it for me for as the last
rope gave away the ateamer lurched to
starboard my hands were wrenched
loose and i fell toward the deck

  as i fell the half-wrecked boat went
over the side into the ocean the two
men had sprung to the rail to see that it
cleared properly i struck the deck on
my feet within half a dozen yards of
them

  there was a large coil of rope near
by and i was able to dash behind it in
the darkness they did not see me and
the roaring of the sea and wind prevent-
ed them hearing me

   youll have to submit to a search
sir i heard captain hawson tell my
uncle


the railroad mans magazine

   heard my uncle laugh in reply and
after a time the captains voice again

   very good you are at liberty to
come and go as you please so long as
you do not attempt any tricks if you
do that ill be obliged to confine you in
your cabin of course

   i have had no dinner uncle dick
reminded him

   i beg your pardon you shall be
served immediately

  he called one of the crew and gave
him orders uncle dick and the men
walked down the deck within half a
dozen feet of me then they disappeared
below

  i took stock of my predicament i
wanted to let uncle dick know that i
was aboard and how i came to be there
yet i did not wish to be discovered by
the crew i remained behind the coil of
rope for fully half an hour before ma-
king a move

  the sea was comparatively calm and
i had grown used to the rolling of the
steamer i crept from my place of con-
cealment and made my way cautiously
along the deck keeping away from the
lights

  at a cabin door i heard voices and
hurried by once a sailor hurried by me
and  crouched against the cabin my
heart pounding at my ribs

  i was afraid to attempt to go below
for there were lights everywhere and
there was the danger of running into
some one coming up so  went on to-
ward the stern

  i found no way there of getting below
and dared not go too close to the man at
the wheel i returned and stood just
outside the circle of light peering down
wondering how  was to get to my uncle
without any one seeing me

  while i stood there captain hawson
came from forward and went below he
entered the first cabin to the right

  i waited a moment then followed him
slipping down as quickly as possible 
heard voices in the first cabin among
them those of captain hawson and
uncle dick there were footsteps upon
the deck some one was coming down

  there was no time to lose no time in
which to plan without hesitation i
stepped to the first door on the left
grasped the knob felt it turn and the

door open and the next instant was
inside the dark cabin wjth the door
closed i was just in time for the steps
outside told me one of the cew had
come below to see the skipper

  i gasped for breath and turned from
the door there was no light in the
cabin except that which filtered in under
the door the porthole was closed and
i started to walk across toward it be-
fore i reached it i stopped and my heart
stood still

   who is there a voice had asked

  i did not reply the voice came to
me again

  who is there speak instantly or
ill fire at youl

  it was a womans voice but there was
the ring of determination in it which
told me she did not speak without true
meaning

  i threw myself upon the floor

   dont fire for gods sake dont
fire i gasped

  who are you

  the words came from across the cabin
where i judged the bunk to be i heard
the swish of her skirts as she moved
then a match flared up was touched to
a candle and the light shaded i sat up
on the floor

   a boy   heard her gasp in sur-
prise

   dont shoot  i implored

  she held a revolver in one hand the
candle in the other as she moved to-
ward me trying to see me better

  what are you doing here she de-
manded

  i do not intend to harm you i an-
swered  i-i had to come in here if
i hadnt he would have seen me

   who would have seen you

   one of the men he was coming
below i was standing outside i opened
the nearest door to escape him he did
not see me enter

   who are you  she asked

   my name is roland burke

   what are you doing aboard this
ship  

   i was standing at the dock i ex-
plained  the men came back running
away from the police and i was hurled
into their boat before i could get away
no one knows i am on this ship youll
not tell them
the daughter of the idol



    i dont understand yet she said

   dont you  they had captured a
man and were bringing him to the ship
after we got here i found that the man
they captured was my uncle

  your uncle

   yes-richard engle he is an ex-
plorer do you know him

  for she had given a little cry when i
spoke my uncles name

   never mind that she said  why
do they want your uncle

   i dont know i replied  they
are going to take him somewhere so the
captain said

   and no one knows you are on
board 

  no one youll not tell them will
yea i want to get to my uncle of
course and let him know but i dont
want to tell the others  am afraid
she put the candle down upon the
table and reached down and helped me
to my feet

   you poor boy she said

   why do you say that  i asked

   do not ask questions now she re-
plied and there was a deal of sadness in
her voice

   you didnt tell me your name i 
said  i want to thank you for not tell-
ing them i am here

   my name is ruth holland she re-
plied

   do you know why they are treating
uncle dick so i asked

   let us not talk about that now she
said  i think i know but the story is
too long for me to tell you now

  he isnt in danger is he 

  he is in grave danger she said

 we must help him-you and l but
we must be careful now they must not
know you are o i the ship well have
to wait roland until we get a chance-
she ceased whispering for there were
steps outside again and some one knocked
on the door miss holland pulled at
my arm and motioned for me to get be-
neath the bunk then she dropped the
bed-clothing carelessly so that i could
not be seen

   who is there she called

   captain hawson i want to enter

   come in she responded

  the door opened and  heard the
captain enter

  you have been sleeping he asked
   yes she said

   i was afraid the gunfire had alarmed
you there is no need for fear now

   i did not hear it she replied

 the forts tried to stop us the cap-
tain said  we are away now and
safe do you feel like eating dinner
can you not serve it in here she
asked  id rather eat alone

   no one will disturb you if you eat
in the other cabin it would be more
convenient

  i heard him step across the cabin
what are you going to do she
asked

   the bedclothes are falling on the
floor

   ill arrange them she said quickly
 will you serve my dinner in here to-
night  

   as you please he answered and
went out

  miss holland stepped across to the
bunk

   get against the wall and lie perfect-
ly still roland she instructed me  i
dont think youll be discovered i had
my dinner brought here for i knew you
must be hungry

   thank you i whispered in reply
i was famished i knew it the mo-
ment captain hawson spoke of dinner
though in the excitement i had not real-
ized it before i lay against the wall
as she had told me for several minutes
then i heard the door open again and
some one come in

   captain sent dinner miss some one
said	i

   put it on the table she replied
  shall i wait

   certainly not i desire to dine
alone ill put the tray outside when i
have finished

   very well miss

  the man withdrew and for a moment
or so i heard no sound then miss
holland cautiously lifted the clothing
which hid me

   come out roland she said   but
be ready to go to your hiding-place
quickly if any one comes

  that was a good dinner and i en-
joyed it although there was a scarcity of
knives forks and spoons it was no
time for etiquette however


the railroad mans magazine

   i believe you are a good boy ro-
land she said

   thank you i replied  you are
certainly a beautiful young lady

   ah roland she said with a little
laugh  for all the world like your
uncle 	

   then you do know him  i cried

  her face flushed rosy red as she
turned it away her voice caught a
little when she looked back at me
again there were traces of tears in her
eyes

   let us not talk of him now please
she said  i know him-yes

   every one loves uncle dick i said
not knowing what else to say

  does every one she said trying
to laugh again but there was no laugh-
ter in her heart and the poor semblance
of it that came from her lips lacked
merriment or joy or even pleasure

   dont you i demanded

   roland she said  let us not talk
of him now please

   i beg your pardon i replied

  we had finished eating and i began
to wonder whether i was always to be
a prisoner in the cabin miss holland
sat with her elbows upon the table her
pretty chin resting in her hands think-
ing she seemed to have forgotten my
presence

  she was not any larger than i but
was much older of course her hair
was as black as night her cheeks red her
eyes flashing her neck and arms were
as white as marble and her lips perfect

  she was very beautiful to look at and
i wondered whether uncle dick had ever
loved her and where he had met her
and how and why it was that she didnt
want to talk about him i knew ever so
many girls back home who raved over
uncle dick and talked about him every
chance they got but miss holland
seemed different somehow

  just as i got through wondering this
there were steps outside again i got be-
neath the bunk quickly and she dropped
the clothes so that i was completely
hidden

  some one knocked at the door and
miss holland told him to enter

  you have finished eating asked
captain hawsons voice

       

   there is nothing else you would
like

   nothing thank you

 there is another passenger aboard
the captain said he is going to your
destination too perhaps youd like to
talk with him may i bring him in
who is the gentleman

   mr richard engle the captain
replied and chuckled

  i heard miss holland rise to her feet
and move back toward the bunk she
hesitated a moment before replying

   ill gladly welcome mr engle she
said finally

  the captain stepped out of the room
and miss holland stooped and whispered
to me

   roland she said  this interview
will pain me more than you can dream
im doing it for your sake it is a
chance to let your uncle know you are
aboard the faraway

  before i could reply the door opened
again and my uncle entered with the
captain i peered from behind the bed-
clothing to see what took place

  miss holland this is mr engle
the captain said

   mr engle and i have met before
miss holland said in a peculiar tone

  my uncles face had gone white as he
looked at her he staggered against the
wall of the cabin his voice was hard
and cold when he spoke

   captain hawson he said  ill not
ask you again to tell me this ships desti-
nation now that i see miss holland
here i fully understand

chapter iv

a gentlemans duty

t t e bowed in cold courtesy and start-
a ed to back out the door i heard
miss holland gasp heard her take a
step forward and there was sadness in
her voice when she spoke

   mr engle she said  i would like
a few words with you in private

  is an interview necessary my
uncle asked

   must i beg you to grant me one
she said

  uncle dick stepped back into the
cabin
the daughter of the idol



    trust that i have not forgotten
how to act toward a lady he said
 will you leave us alone captain haw-
son  

   with the greatest pleasure the cap-
tain replied  it seems you two people
are not exactly cordial toward each
other it were better for you to be good
friends you are to make a long journey
together

  then he went out and closed the door

  well miss holland my uncle
asked turning toward her

   what i have to say must not be
overheard she whispered  do not
think i requested this interview for my
own sake i have news for you-some-
thing you should know

  well my uncles voice was still
cold and hard

   i wish you wouldnt use that tone
toward me miss holland said  some
day you will learn- but never mind
that now what i have to say to you is
this-your nephew roland burke is
aboard this steamer

   roland  my uncle exclaimed
 what do you mean

  hush-they may overhear us he
came into this cabin i am hiding him

  i dont understand you dont mean
-youcant mean that even my relatives
are not safe from-

   his presence here is an accident
she interrupted

  then she told him the story as i had
told her

  where is lie uncle dick asked

  miss holland raised the bed-clothing
and  crawled from beneath the bunk
uncle dick hurried across the cabin and
took me in his arms

   my poor boy he said

   why i demanded

   you have no knowledge-thank
heaven-of what is in store for you

   what does it all mean i asked

   do not question now lie answered
 we must keep you concealed if pos-
sible

   he may remain in here miss hol-
land offered

   but there is a chance he will be dis-
covered would it not be better for him
to hide in my cabin then if discovery
comes i can at least be present to fight
for him

   are you afraid to leave the boy with
me miss holland asked

  for a moment they looked each other
straight in the eyes

   it isnt that my uncle said after
a time  what are we to do the
captain may return soon

 youll never be able to get him to
your cabin without being seen she said
 yet it must lie done some way

   leave him here until there is a good
chance she said

   ill come for him at the first oppor-
tunity my uncle replied  let us hope
his presence aboard will not be discov-
ered and yet-even so-there seems no
chance for escape

   there is always a chance miss
holland replied

  i stepped between them

   what does it all mean i demand-
ed  what is this danger of which you
hint 

   you are to know nothing at present
my uncle said  these fanatics-

  he stopped for miss holland had
raised a hand in warning

   if ill befalls this bov it is your
work my uncle said to her

   it is not my work she said

  uncle dick laughed cruelly

   do you think  do not understand
he asked  why talk of it at all we
understand each other

   there is a great deal youll under-
stand some day she told him

  again that peculiar look flashed be-
tween them a look of mingled anger and
defiance the thing was getting on my
nerves i was in the dark seemingly in
danger though i knew not of what
facing a secret understanding or misun-
derstanding between these two in which
i played no part

  i started- as though to speak when
there came a knock at the door it was
the work of a second to get beneath the
bunk again and for miss holland to
drop the blankets before me captain
hawson entered the cabin

   just thought id run in and see if
youd killed each other he said  you
two had better make up and be friends

   captain hawson my uncle replied
 youll be kind enough to attend strictly
to your own business

   dont get nasty about it the cap-


the railroad mans magazine

tain warned  my men used you rough-
ly ill admit but it was necessary youll
have no complain to make during your
voyage just try to be comfortable
my uncle laughed again  they al-
ways give a condemned man all he wants
to eat he said

   you seem to know what is ahead
of you the captain said

   seem to know  uncle dick cried
 do you think i do not do you think
i do not understand the language of
your crew-do not know from where they
hail do i not see this ladv-here
mr engle ruth holland cried
captain hawson threw up his hands
in despair

  stop it he exclaimed ill not
have any fights aboard my ship the
crew does enough of that without the
passengers beginning it

  my uncle backed to the door

   with your permission miss hol-
land ill retire to my own cabin he
said  ill see you again in the morning
 very well mr engle she replied
captain hawson laughed and fol-
lowed my uncle out of the cabin they
had been gone for several minutes before
miss holland spoke to me then she
sat down on the edge of the bunk and
lifted the blankets and i crawled out
and sat on the cabin floor before her
what is it all about i asked

   i can tell you nothing she said
 youll know all in time  here is a
revolver you may have to use if it is
necessary i have another

  i slipped the weapon in my pocket
you know how to use it she
asked

   very well i answered  uncle
dick taught me he is a good shot
 yes-he is a good shot she said
you have seen him shoot

   let us not speak of it now she
said and her face clouded again

   i heard the ships bell strike then and
she bade me get beneath the bunk again
as though she expected some one to en-
ter the cabin indeed i was no more
than hidden when the door opened and
half a dozen of the crew entered they
did iiot speak but ranged themselves
against the cabin walls holding their
caps in their hands and looking at miss
holland as men look at a goddess

  presently one of them began speaking
in that peculiar foreign tongue and at
intervals the others answered him
then the spokesman took from beneath
his jacket a small idol and placed it
upon the table they bowed before it
and went back against the wall again

  then the spokesman began in halting
english

   most exalted one he said  it is
again the hour and we ask your an-
swer

   my answer is still no  miss hol-
land replied

   you have considered wel   

  it is a matter that needs no con-
sideration she replied

   great honor is preferable to death
 not always she answered  some-
times death is preferable to what some
men call great honor

   we will visit you again at the hour
we express the hope that you shall have
changed your mind

   i shall never change my mind she
said

  they left her but she remained stand-
ing before the table looking dowrn at
where the small idol had rested sev-
eral minutes passed and the door opened
again

  it was a stranger who entered a man
who was either american or english-
who seemed apart from the others

   you  miss holland exclaimed
  does it surprise you he asked

   i knew you had something to do
with it but  did not think you had
courage enough to be aboard yourgelf
 perhaps i am not lacking in cour-
age he said  does my presence
annoy you  

    it does she said frankly

   why should it   he demanded
 it would be better dont you think to
treat me with courtesy  

  he had stepped to the table and
stood just across from her i saw his
hand go out toward her try to clutch
at hers she stepped back against the
bunk

  it is time to have done with non-
sense he said following her  why
do you hold out against me as you do
cant you realize that vou are help-
less 

   there is always a chance she said
the daughter of the idol



  not when frederic welch engineers
 the job 

  you have made mistakes before
 she reminded him

  but not this time welch said

  will you kindly leave my cabin

  when it pleases me

  i ask yon to leave the cabin she
 said

 and suppose i refuse to go

  ill call for help  

 no man aboard this ship would
 raise a hand to help you if i bade him
 otherwise 

 leave my cabin-she said again
 for you are here only to insult me
  i have offered you no harm

  your very presence insults me she
 said will you go

 suppose i refuse he said laugh-
 ing at her

 i heard her breath coming in quick
 gasps like a flash i had sprung from
 beneath the bunk and confronted him
 it was a foolish thing to do under the
 circumstances but  had been reared
 carefully and knew a gentlemans part
 and this man was of my own race not
 a foreigner whose manner and method
 i could not understand

 he reeled against the wall as he saw
 me astonished beyond speech

  mr welch i cried  a gentleman
 always does as a lady requests 

 i stood there before him my hands
 clenched my teeth shut tightly

 he laughed a gentleman he
 sneered  what do you know about
 gentlemen you young cur

 as he spoke he struck me across the

face with the flat of his hand miss
holland gave a little scream and reeled
against the table

  the revolver miss holland had given
me was in my hand i struck out with
all my strength and the butt of the gun
crashed against his temple before lie
realized what i intended to do he
reeled then crashed to the floor like a
senseless being

  roland roland miss holland
was crying

   do not be frightened i told her

  welch staggered to his feet his face
purple with rage

  you young cur he screamed

   saw his fist uplifted saw him start
across the cabin toward me there was
no defense  could make except to
shoot and i did not want to take a hu-
man life yet i was determined not to
submit tamely to an assault and so
raised the revolver

   dont shoot him roland  miss
holland was crying

  he did not seem to see the weapon
i held but sprang on toward me my
finger touched the trigger then the
cabin-door was hurled open and some
one threw himself into the room and
upon welchs back

  in an instant welch was hurled the
length of the cabin to crash against the
porthole there he stopped his eyes
blazing back at uncle dick miss hol-
land standing between them i resting
against the bunk

   a man who insults women and at-
tacks boys is a fitting person to be mixed
up in this business  my uncle cried

                       to be continued

special gars for autos and fish

fifty auto railway cars something en-
tirely new in railroad-car construc-
tion have just been turned out by the mil-
waukee road at its shops in milwaukee

  these cars substantially built and ornate
in appearance each forty-one feet in length
are intended solely for the transportation of
automobiles which has come to be a large
item in the transportation business

  the special  milwaukee  cars for this
class of shipment are designed with a view
of carrying complete automobiles without

the least twisting or cramping large
double doors are located on each side at
the opposite ends so that the machines may
be easily loaded and unloaded

  another new style of car now being built
by the milwaukee road at its shops is a spe-
cial refrigerator car for the pacific coast
fish-trade these cars are about the size of
the regular baggage-car are of the pas-
senger-train style and finish carrying the
milwaukee roads regular color and are sup-
plied with a complete refrigeration-plant

no  - billy m has a merry time trying to make the rubes
fall for a new blue uniform with gold braid
and brass buttons

back in the mulligatawny age
say two or three million
i years ago-or to put it
 more definitely the post-
tertiary period of the mam-
malian age-the only ap-
parel covering the genus homo was
coarse unkempt hair	

  i got this from darwin the scientist
or from dooley the philosopher or
from professor doocllespeck of petro-
leum university illinois but i dont re-
member which this is a mean and un-
worthy reflection for a proud man to
indulge in but whenever  look upon
a pullman conductor in his new spring
uniform it comes to me in that way

  now from the bristling nucleated
epidermis of the tree - man to the fine
blue-and-gold braid of a parlor-car man
is a long way yet many of us were
here when the blue and the gold braid
appeared among us and we have wit-
nessed within easy memory this last
phase of evolution to the point of spot-
less elegance

evolution is at work

  the matter is placed before the reader
in this way to remind him that even in
railroading the forces of evolution are
at work and that changes and improve-
ments are constantly taking place

  there was a time in railroading-not
more than one generation ago - when

  there were no blue uniforms  gold
buttons no badges

  the pioneer conductor and brakeman
appeared in bobtail coats wide-buttoned
checkered pantaloons and derby or
slouch hats they had on them  dis-
tinguishing marks they could only be
told from the passengers by acquaint-
ance or by evidences of authority

  the conductor careened up and down
the aisle of the coaches and collected
cash fares without regard to interstate
commerce laws or state commission
rules he was not even annoyed with
a duplex cash-fare receipt he just
took the money and put it into a deep
pocket and passed on to the next pas-
senger simple arrangement wasnt it

knew the con personally

  people did not care whether they
bought tickets or paid the conductor
there was  penalty they often knew
the conductor personally and the fellow
sympathy and human touch naturally
led to the cash fare

  but the first conductor that ran the
first train and collected the first fare
had a wag for apassenger the wag
handed the conductor a piece of silver
the conductor gave it critical scrutiny
it had an unknown head  one side and
a strange tail on the other it was
mexican canadian or egyptian - the
puzzled conductor did not know which

series began in the july  railroad mans maeazine single copies  ceots


observations of a country station-agent 

   here he said to the passenger  i
cant use this

   then give it to the company re-
plied the wag

  a very clever retort was it not

  this first conductor then passed on
to the second passenger the second
passenger was not a wag but was nosey
and curious he paid a cash fare and
the conductor thrust it down deep into
his trousers

   say said the passenger  how
can you tell whats your
money and whats the com-
panys 

-	 very easy replied the
conductor who was a nifty
proposition and afterward
owned the road  when i
get through i toss all the
money to the top of the car

all that sticks to the bell-
cord belongs to the company

what comes down is mine

  just then the train whis-
tled for herkimer the
brakeman twisted the brakes
and more cash fares came
aboard

  george stephenson who
invented the road and b f

morse who later added cer-
tain improvements were occu-
pying the next seat together
and laughed heartily at these
jokes which are officially la-
beled no  and no 

  by heck exclaimed
morse  people air a going
to say a mighty lot of funny
tilings about conductors and
cash fares

  they have they do and
they will no  and no 
vinted in s have not been
improved upon and are now
recognized as standard by all
railroad organizations

  when a passenger wants
to be pleasant with the con-
ductor he tells one or both the best
plan is to tell no  going down and
save no  for the return trip that
shows versatility when a conductor
does not enthuse over either of them
ask him bluntly when he expects to have
enough to quit railroading

   	r r

  if that does not bring a sickly half-
hearted smile tell him about the con-
ductor you know who worked ten year
and saved enough from his salary of one
hundred per to buy a section of illinois
that may arouse interest at least it
will show that you are wise to the game

  joke no  on the conductor was per-
petrated fifty years later by the railroad
itself when they equipped him with a
cash-fare receipt which enables the pas-
senger to know all the particulars and

all

that sticks to the bell-cord belongs to
          the company

preserves the identical memorandum for
the roads accounting department

  joke no  is intended to head off
jokes  and  just as one train-order
often annuls another of previous num-
ber

  along about the same time it occurred


the railroad mans magazine

to some one in authority that the plain-
citizens attire had certain disadvantages
as any rogue could impersonate a con-
ductor and beat him to a cash fare
passengers often found it difficult to
pick him out when wanting information
the first thought was to tag him with a
badge then they had him wear a cap
and finally he appeared in the military
splendor of a blue uniform brass-but-
toned and gold-braided

the foolish question

  the conductor has always remained
true to his colors no matter how
stifling oppressive or sweltering the
day he moves down the aisle panting
and perspiring with every stitch of his
regalia hung upon him

  the panting passenger throws off his
coat and bares his neck to any welcome
breeze that comes in at the window
the conductor is permitted to unbutton
his vest but beyond that he violates the
proprieties he takes his fully togged
at  fahrenheit there is no better
subject in all this broad expanse to hail
with that jocular query  is it hot
enough for you

  thats a torrid - season joke on the
conductor official label no 

  some roads go even farther and uni-
form their station employees

billys glad rags

billy m was agent at k when the

b	and b road issued a  glad rag  ulti-
matum to all its agents ticket - sellers
and station baggagemen

   i had to do it said billy  or quit
i didnt want to wear a blue uniform
and cap in a small town everybody
looks you over and makes remarks i
knew when i went up street i would
create a sensation of course i could
have kept a citizens coat vest and hat
at the station and changed when i sal-
lied forth among the ribald population
but thats too much trouble

   two days after i received the outfit
i boldly walked up to the post-office in
full official regalia i was hailed with
loud acclaim small boys ran along be-
hind me and tradespeople came to their
doors to look me over they called me

 major and piped off the outfit with
all the ready wit a village commands

   i comported myself with dignity
after all there is something stiffening
in blue clothes and gold trimmings
they lend to poise decorum and cir-
cumspection they drew attention to
me and i unconsciously stepped higher
and breathed deeper  returned to the
depot feeling i was no longer unnoticed
and unsung

   during the day i handled some
mailbags hustled some baggage trucked
in a lot of green hides and a number of
tubs of ancient butter together with a
general assortment of merchandise in
barrels boxes and bags

decorum and other lugs

   i solved the problem of an agents
uniform in this way in addressing the
public over the counter or through the
window a neat uniform and spick and
span appearance add to his prestige but
from lugging the dead calf from the
scales to the trucks common jerkies have
all other outfits beaten a mile

   a day or so after i had been wear-
ing my blue uniform billy continued
 i went out to the platform and struck
a posing attitude that all might see an
old g a r man hobbled up gave me
a look and saluted i saluted in return

    you fellows had it easy said he

    deuce we have i said warmly
 what do you know about our work  

    me know  bristled the old man
with a shriek  wasnt i with phil
sheridan all through it wasnt i in

   now i suppose i should have sent
both the bundle and the dollar back to
the old man with the proper explana-
tion  have a strong but phlegmatic
conscience i delayed but at last i
sent the money and the clothes to the
captain of the salvation army at the
nearest city i signed  from a
friend

   on the great record grandpap will
get credit for that i pfbpaid the ex-
press on the outfit-thirty cents that
much was out of my own pocket that
means one small mark for me

   a day or so after this incident i
again sauntered out on the platform in
full regimentals and drew myself up in
a sort of magnificent fulness so satisfy-
ing to the man in striking attire when
a wild-eyed hatless young man rushed
upon me and grasped me by the arm

    come on quick i want you   he
bellowed  hurry before they get
away  well get all three of em the
dirty dogs 

   i dont understand the witless im-
pulse that sent me along with that fel-

low but i went with him on a trot
he was in a ranting frenzy he
brought me up in front of a saloon half
a block away

   arrest all of em  he shouted
  they kicked me out git em git
 em 

  he stood off a little waving his
 arms and shouting encouragement and
 waited for me to sail -in i hesitated

   are you afraid   he yelled

then chief of police

  now that fellows brand of hypno-
 tism was only good for thirty seconds
 and i came to

   whats the row   i asked inno-
 cently

dont let em get away he
shrieked  get all of em they kicked
me out 

   i dont see why i should have any-
 thing to do with it i began to protest

   what aint you the chief of po-

  i admitted that i was not i was

continued billy  in one
week i was a spanish-

of them they look at him closely
he flashes back all the tiffany elegance
a good salary permits

   when he passes a ticket back to a
passenger and the passenger inadver-
tently diverts an eye for a brief moment
to the jeweled finger holding the ticket
thomas gets thrills that you and i wot
not of

thomas gets thrills

   thomas has a sort of cat-and-water
horror of one duty-that of rejecting a
refractory passenger it musses him up
so they tell me that when this must
be done thomas goes to the baggage-
car and daintily detaches two or three
thousand dollars worth of ornaments
before undertaking the operation

   very often when he returns the
fervor of the belligerent has somewhat
cooled and actual hostility is averted

   i understand the road thinks well
of the plan and may insist on other
conductors equipping themselves with a
bunch of kohinoors

   the laugh is now on thomas i
started to tell you the story did you
ever notice the pair of cuff-buttons he

 wore for a long time
 he paid five hundred
 dollars for them two
 hundred and fifty dol-
 lars each - think of
 that they were gen-
 uine sapphires and
 thomas prized them
 very highly

    one day not very
 long ago when thom-
 ass train pulled into
 the station at chicago
 there was something
 of a jam of hurrying
 passengers in the ves-
 tibule and thomas
 was jostled a little in
 straightening out the
 confusion when the
 last passenger was out
 and lost in the swarm-
 ing multitude beyond
 the gate thomas dis-
 covered that one of
 his cuff - buttons was
 missing

   a thorough search of the coaches
failed to locate it thomas lamented
the loss very greatly not for the price
but because he was attached to the stone
you and i do not understand that

    of course he quickly inserted an
 ad  in the  lost  column of the
dailies describing the button and offer-
ing a suitable reward he really ex-
pected no results but there was a bare
possibility that it might have fallen into
honest hands the unexpected hap-
pened this letter came to him in
response

  kind sir

    i have noticed your advertisement
 in the morning planet in leaving my
 train in the union depot a few days ago
 i picked up a cuff-button some one had
 dropped i had no opportunity to find
 an owner i have it now in my posses-
 sion if it is yours you may call at
 my apartments no - mohammed ave-
 nue and recover the same the stone
 and button are rather unusual and i
 think if you can show its mate no
 other identification will be required to
 prove that you are the rightful owner
 very sincerely

               mrs v m moriseen
observations of a country station-agent



   thomas hastened to the place indi-
cated

   he was met by a pleasant-iaced old
lady with snow-white hair

    i found a cuff-button the lady ex-
plained  as  was leaving the train at
the union depot last thursday after-
noon when i saw your  ad  in the
 lost  column of the planet i took it
you were the rightful owner i presume
you have the mate

   thomas produced the mate from its
tissue wrappings and handed it to the
lady

    i think that is it she said looking
it over

   she unlocked a convenient drawer
and took out the other button and care-
fully compared them

    i think there can be no mistake
she said returning them both to
thomas  they are quite unusual but
they match in every respect i suspect
they have a pretty fair value

    they cost me five hundred dollars
blurted thomas

    indeed   she exclaimed with mild
surprise

   thomas wrapped them up carefully
and put them safely away then some-
what awkwardly he fished up a twenty-
dollar gold coin  its your reward for
returning the lost piece he said

    really she protested  i could not
accept anything one hardly expects a
reward for doing right i cannot pos-
sibly-i-i- - still i might take the
coin and  turn it over to the mission as
a contribution from you a stranger
the credit to oe yours

  it was arranged that way

   it isnt often a lost gem of that
value falls into honest hands and is re-

trains forbidden

the michigan railroad commission re-
cently declared by the supreme court
to be absolute boss of the railroads in michi-
gan has issued an order prohibiting the
running of trains backward or with cars
ahead of the engine the various lines
were given ninety days to put in ys and
turn-tables and it is probable that the order
will cause trouble because of the expense

  the chief reason is that the engineer does

turned to the owner but now and then
there is an honest man or woman even
in a great city heres a match dio-
genes

   a month later thomas noticed one
of the settings was loose and that the
cuff was blacked where the button
rubbed he hastened to the jeweler of
whom he had purchased the pair and
complained

   the jeweler gave a quick but critical
glance

    diable  he exclaimed  you
never bought these of us they are
cheap imitations both of them not
worth five dollars a pair we do not
handle counterfeits sir you have been
imposed on elsewhere indfeed you
have sir 

  thomas hastened to mohammed
avenue the gray-haired lady was not
there-had never been there-was en-
tirely unknown she had never been
heard of at the mission either

   didnt she turn a neat one on
thomas whats the use diogenes
blow it out

the struggle  why not go back to na-

  at the same time billy brushed a
little dust off his blue pants picked
some lint off his  blue coat and passed
his hand over the badge on his gold-
braid cap for a brighter polish

we like to be as useful to our readers as we can but because of the great popularity
of this department we are forced to impose certain restrictions in future we
shall be compelled to limit its scope to the answering of questions of an inform-
ative technical or historical nature only

    we receive dozens of queries in regard to the right person to apply to for certain
classes of employment if the writers will pause for a moment to consider the title of
the proper official will readily occur to them and in any case the information can be
obtained by application to the headquarters of the company involved much more quickly
than we can publish it

    if a reader after following these directions still finds himself lacking in information
and will write us giving his full name and postal address we will try to satisfy him
through the mail but we cannot answer any letter in which it is not made clear that
some real difficulty exists

is it consistent with good railroading to
make a meet order on form   to be
delivered to the ruling train and is it
a violation of the standard code to make a
meet order on form   at all

a h wichita falls texas

  it is not consistent with good railroading
to use form    as you suggest in first
part of your question  roads where both
forms are in use for the remainder
would say that the standard code gives in-
ferior train   order but superior or as
you term it ruling train gets    order



ah f east st louis illinois-to ob-

	tain position with a surveying party
application should be addressed to the chief
engineer of the railroad where employment
is desired you should endeavor to learn
the road which has new work under way or
in contemplation as the chances for employ-

ment in that contingency would necessarily
be brighter

the necessity for experience on the part
of the applicant depends largely  the po-
sition desired refer to march  num-
ber of thf railroad mans magazine

blasts call for signals ro one long
and two short blasts to call attention of
the same or inferior class to signals dis-
played by a following section to be an-
swered by two short blasts of the whistle
n two long and two short blasts ap-
proaching public grade crossings  one
double long blast approaching stations
junctions and railroad crossings at grade
 two long and two short blasts to be
repeated at intervals approaching obscure
crossings  four short blasts repeated
to be given by engineer on siding or 
double track to warn a passing train that
it is following another train too closely

  b	trains of the first-class are superior
to those of the second-class trains of the
second-class arc superior to those of the
third and so  extra trains are inferior
to regular trains

  the above is quoting the book of rules
but the exact definition of what comprises
a first-class train can only be derived from
the time-table there is not general uni-
formity in the classification ordinarily all
passenger-trains are first-class but we have
in mind one road where only electric trains
are so designated steam passenger-trains
second-class and scheduled freight-trains
third-class

gh ogesna wisconsin - there are

	many occupations in a large round-
house for men without trades for
instance tlue-cleancrs arch-brick men pit-
cleaners wipers fire builders engine watch-
ers turntable men and helpers for ma-
chinists and boilermakers and the other
trades

  a inexperienced man would likely be
assigned as a helper or to whatever in the
judgment of the foreman or master me-
chanic he is best fitted for the position of
hostler which your letter indicates as the
one you have in mind is quite responsible

  hostlers as a rule move engines from
the point where the engineers and firemen
leave them until they are finally placed over
a pit in the roundhouse in some instances
they take the engines from the roundhouse
to the station for other trains and the regu-
lar crew takes them there this means of
course moving over often several miles of
yard tracks and it is necessary that the
hostler pass the eye examination and be fully
qualified for the signals

  such responsible positions pay about 
per day and often engineers are used at the
regular road rates hostlers are generally
promoted from hostler helpers who receive
from jii to  per day hostlers not
engaged  main line tracks are paid any-
where from  to  per day

who invented the stephenson link
which is used in locomotive valve
motion and what is its history

e c hornell new york

  we can quote no better authority than
angus sinclair  this subject he says
there is no doubt but that the link was
invented by william t james of new
york a most ingenious mechanic who also
invented the double eccentrics he experi-
mented a great deal during the period from
 to  and while his work proved of
 commercial value to him it is probable
that long who started the norris locomo-
tive works at philadelphia and introduced
the double eccentrics was indebted to james
for the idea of a separate eccentric for each
motion

  the credit of inventing the shifting
link is due to william howe of newcastle
england he was a pattern-maker employed
by robert stephenson  co and he invent-
ed the link in  in practically its present
form

   howes idea was to get out an improved
reversing motion he made a sketch of the


the railroad mans magazine

link which he explained to his employers
who were favorably impressed with his idea
and permitted him to make a pattern of it
and afterward gave a trial on a locomotive
constructed for the midland railway com-
pany it proved successful the first day

  although stephenson gave howe the
means of applying his invention howe
failed to perceive its actual value for it
was not patented seeing how satisfactorily
it worked stephenson paid howe twenty
guineas for the device and secured a patent
under his own name

  this is how the link comes to be called
the  stephenson link the credit for this
invention was not extravagantly paid for

 what becomes of the expansion and
 contraction in a continuously welded
 street-car rail 

             l a b st louis missouri

   in the first place it is endeavored to weld
 the rail-joints at as nearly a mean tempera-
 ture as possible so as to have as little
 extreme contraction due to heat or cold
 the strain due to contraction is taken care
 of by the fact that the cross section of the
 rail is large enough to give sufficient
 strength to withstand this pull without be-
 ing strained beyond the elastic limit of the
 material this has been proved by tests at
 the government arsenal watertown massa-
 chusetts

   in the matter of expansion due to in-
 creased temperature it is largely checked by
 the grip of the pavement in which it is laid
by the light of the lantern



 and most of the track which has been weld-
 ed in recent years lias been bedded in con-
 crete base any movement which this grip
 of the pavement does not hold goes into
 slight irregularities of line and we presume
 the cross-section of rail may be slightly in-
 creased you must remember that as rails
 are so largely in use in paved streets only
 a very small proportion of the surface is
 exposed to the sun

  the electric-lighted trains of the new
york new haven and hartford railroad

steam from the locomotive and the neces-
sary attention to this dynamo when on the
road devolves upon the baggagemaster the
pay of train electricians where such positions
are in evidence is approximately  per

brake valve 

j g c boston massachusetts-

  l	in the early days of railroading prac-
  tically  attention was paid to the neces-

sity for braking power on the engine and
tender  account of the service conditions
prevailing and fear of flattening and slip-
ping the driving-wheel tires a little later
straight air-brakes similar to those under
the cars were applied to tenders then the
driver brake was added and later as it be-
came necessary to utilize every possible
means for obtaining braking power the
truck brake thus forming the complete brake
installation

  later the development of the high-speed
brake equipment led also to the addition of
the high-speed devices to the locomotive
equipment when further improvements be-
came necessary the undesirability of adding
further to the existing equipment became
apparent and it was resolved to depart from
the previous lines along which improvements
had been made and to design outright an
equipment which would combine the func-
tions of several pieces of apparatus and in-
clude the features required ol a brake which
should meet the requirement arising from
present- day conditions this equipment to
cover all kinds of service and classes and
weights of locomotives

  the brake known as the  et which of
course means engine and tender in-
cludes all of the advantageous features
which have been worked into previous equip-
ments eliminates many of the undesirable
features inseparable from former types and
provides many additional operative features
which have long been desired but hitherto
unobtainable with other types of equipment

  the first  et  equipment was put in
service june  but you will of course
understand that this was more or less an
experiment at that time and since then the
 et  has been modified and improved in a
number of particulars the present standard
being the no   et  equipment which
has been in service for about three years

  	after the brake-cylinder pressure has
been entirely released from emergency ap-
plication the brakes can be reapplied in an
emergency immediately and full pressure
obtained this operation can be repeated in-
definitely it is presumed you understand
that this refers to the locomotive brakes
only as on the car brakes the re-
sults of such an operation would de-
pend entirely upon the type of triple valve
employed

  	the notch employed to release the
locomotive brake using the automatic brake-
valve of the  et  equipment is the run-
ning position notch as the locomotive brake
is automatically held applied in all positions
of the automatic brake-valve handle except
running position

what is horse-power as applied to a
locomotive and how is it deter-
mined 

g	a j baltimore maryland

  the term horse-power was first estab-
lished by janies watt who ascertained that
a strong london draft-horse was capable
of doing work for a short interval of time
equal to lifting  pounds one foot high
in one minute this value was used by
watt in expressing the power of his engines
and has since been universally adopted in
mechanics

  the expression  foot pounds  is used to
denote the unit of work and is the force
required to lift a weight of one pound
through a space of one foot horse-power
is the measure of the rate at which work is
performed and is equal to  pounds

lifted one foot in one minute or one pound
lifted  feet in one second therefore
one horse-power equals  foot pounds per
second

  the general formula for ascertaining the
horse-power of a locomotive is as follows

           pxlxaxn
         -hp



in which

        p means effective pressure in
           pounds per square inch

         l length of stroke in feet

         a area of piston in square inches

        n number of strokes four times
            the number of revolutions
            per minute

         hp indicated horse-power

  the tractive power of a locomotive mul-
tiplied by the speed in miles per hour di-
vided by  gives liorse-power

a new  waste  for oiling wheels

samuel a flower after learning that  pounds of cotton
waste are consumed yearly invents a new product

samuel a flower was called the
 man who watched the wheels go
round a large majority of the turning
wheels at least all of those of the railroad-
cars rest on half bearings and the lubri-
cating oil is applied to them by putting into
the box below a mass of waste soaked in
oil the waste acts as a wick and draw-
ing the oil up presses it against the axle- and
keeps the axle lubricated steadily until the
lubricating oil in the box is exhausted and
must be renewed

  the best sort of waste of the several sorts
was found to be cotton waste the refuse
from the cotton spindles and looms
worth about eight cents a pound yet so
great is the demand that the american
product of one hundred and eighty million
pounds a year is greedily absorbed by the
market it has become the most profitable
by-product of the cotton-plant over forty
million pounds are shipped yearly to ger-
many for cheap fabrics men make for-
tunes in gambling in it at fractions of a cent


the railroad mans magazine

profit it never sells below six cents and
in some years goes over ten

  this constant demand for waste makes a
two hundred per cent increase in price over
cost of production its use for wiping ma-
chinery is universal but something else
was needed

  flower was handicapped in every way
he had nothing on which to begin but his
courage and his wonderful chances it was
a virgin field he was all alone in it and
had no fear of competition

  one of the first steps was the acquisition
of the knowledge that cotton waste has
never been entirely satisfactory sometimes
it is not resilient enough to hold up against
the axle when a costly and dangerous  hot-
box ensues and sometimes bits and par-
ticles become detached and get into the
close-fitting moving parts of the machinery
causing great damage

cotton waste is scarce

  so scarce is cotton waste at times that
some of the railroads that must have it or a
substitute use unmixed cotton and woolen
waste or woolen waste entirely paying the
bills and taking the consequences in trouble
and damages with a sour face

  patiently flower sought the substitute
it must be one that would be cheaper than
cotton waste one that would be resilient
and springy no matter whether heavily
soaked in oil or very nearly dry and that
would not easily part with fragments to get
into the machinery

  he had experimented with all of the in-
expensive fibers and all of them were quite
useless save coir-the fibrous component of
the outer coconut husk his careful re-
search brought him to the conclusion that
this fiber was cheap enough and had the
resiliency it has a stiffness and a rebellious
nature which give it a distinct character
among all fibers and it is impervious to
both oil and water in its natural state

  tts best quality was that it would
neither shrink nor stretch plodding along
until he had hit the right thing he found a
process of treating the coconut fiber that
curled it and then when it was mixed with
cotton waste the combination was perfect
a resilient lubricating waste had been de-
vised that filled all requirements

  it  wicked  the oil to the axle perfectly
soaked or dry it retained its form in all
temperatures and was very difficult to ignite
fragments of either of the two fibers were
infrequent in use the last drop of oil was
used up thereby effecting a great saving
less than half the previous quantity in
weight was needed-one pound of the mix-

ture was sufficient where a railroad car box
required two of the old cotton waste

  when he was sure that he had the right
thing he secured his patents and then he
took it to the experimental department of
one of the great railroads an extremely se-
vere test was proposed a car that was to
travel to the pacific coast was selected
one set of boxes would be packed with the
new compound and another set with the
ordinary waste

 flower knew he had found what he had
been looking for he had learned that the
demand for waste for wiping machinery was
equally great and the supply quite as small
also that the present commodity is not suf-
ficiently absorbent first he tried jute fiber
of the sort that is used in burlap and bag-
ging and because in its natural state it is
non-absorbent his friends laughed at him

  at last the day came when the express-
car which had been made the subject of the
test was due home a body of men whose
business it is to be interested vitally in eve-
rything that promises to save a penny or a
minute in the mechanical end of a railroad
gathered to examine the boxes and the ac-
cumulated reports

  even flower could hardly believe what
he saw the cotton-waste boxes had acted
 the average one had been repacked
and two partially refilled and there had been
the usual troubles the four boxes packed
with the mixed cotton and coconut fiber had
given no trouble they were as full and
springy as the day the car left and there
had been an eighteen per cent saving in the
consufnption of oil  the man who had
watched the wheels go round to so good a
purpose was showered with congratulations
by men who rarely indulge in enthusiasm

may save some money

 one of the men drew the grav-headed
inventor to one side

  see- here my dear mr flower the
 my dear mister seemed dd to the
modest man you have to get a factory and
a plant to make this stuff and i suppose
you will start out at once dont let any-
body fool you out of your rights now i
dont know what these other fellows are go-
ing to do but you can take my open-time
order for half a million pounds at six cents
and begin to fill it as-soon as you can

  that night as he went home the song of
the wheels as they went around beneath
samuel b flower was the tune of millions
over two hundred million dollars is spent
yearly for lubricating oils mr flower may
save the people who buy this oil some
money
the vanished freight

he who told this yarn wasnt known as anner
nias but his friends called him  monk hausen

the job for a raise he gets focused on
a certain locality and fricassees the at-
mosphere at that location and keeps on
plugging at it until the air is all con-
sumed

   this creates as it were a hole in the
atmosphere then nature gets busy and
sends a wireless to the spot where there
is an oversupply of the ethereal fluid and
as soon as the cqd is received the air
makes a bee-line for that vacuous void

   sometimes it travels in a straight
line and sometimes not however as it
travels it assumes a rotary motion due
to a law of physics that all swiftly
moving bodies must rotate as it ad-
vances in its swift flight it is utterly un-
selfish for it takes everything along that
it comes up with

   houses trees and cattle are gath-
ered in its loving embrace and the whole
blooming outfit forms a sort of relief ex-
pedition to the afflicted place the world
moves but kansas is a whole moving-
picture show talk about the shifting
sands of time a kansas cyclone is the
sine qua non of motion and is entitled
to full honorary membership in the

             e loose-jointed individual
and the watery-eyed one
met on common ground
they had both  been fired
from the same freight and
were drawn to each other
-or more correctly speaking fired at
each other for they came near colliding
in the process of ejectment

   must take us for blooming cannon-
balls grunted the loose-jointed one

   yes those fellows are certainly on
the firing - line all right replied the
watery-eyed one  reminds me of the
way ive often floated through space in
kansas riding bareback on a cyclone

  so youve been in kansas too
queried the loose-jointed one  now
theres a state that can boast some
about nearly everything and talking
of cyclones did you ever hear how they
are formed 

   well i met an ex-college professor
out there who had succumbed to the wan-
derlust and hit the road and he explained
the whole thing to me

   you see cyclones are formed in this
way first of all comes one of those
scorching-hot days when the sun is on to


the railroad mans magazine

  	it may leave a path of devastation
behind it but think of what would be-
come of that airless void if the cqd
was ignored

   thats so replied the watery-eyed
one  nature has got railroads skinned
alive when it comes to delivering the
goods then again a cyclone is a great
factor in promoting social intercourse
there are lots of people out there who
would never see each other were it not
for the fact that they are thrown together
by the thoughtful cyclone i know of a
couple of fellows who had not seen
each other for years who met in the
air both joy-riding aboard the same cy-
clone

  hallo bill shouted one i
havent seen you for a good while  no
yelled the other fellow  i dont often get
up this way 

   speaking of railroading said the
loose-jointed individual  id like to re-
late to you some tff my experiences in the
railroad business back in the seventies
i did key-pounding down in kansas on
the p d qroad i held down a shanty
up along the line forty miles from the
nearest refectory

   did nothing much but give the trains
clear track or hold them up to sidc-track
sos to let another train pass the old
p d q was a single-track road with
shanties and sidings at regular intervals
at which a number of other jays like my-
self did the brain-work of the system

   i was holding down this king will-
iam job in that queen anne cottage with
no great white way nearer than the milky
 baldric of the skies and the only stars
i could flirt with were those winking at
me across millions of miles of space
but i was not astronomically inclined-
gastronomy has always been my long suit

   well this particular incident  have
in mind happened on one of those days
when nature seems to be resting and
getting ready for a grand-stand demon-
stration even the grasshoppers had
ceased their campaign against the crops
as a rule the quiet of my position never
bothered me much but that day the si-
lence seemed to get onto my nerves

   i seemed to sense something was go-
ing to happen and felt as fussy as a mag-
netized kitten there was a south-bound
train due at my villa at  pm i had

orders to hold it on the siding until the
north-bound passenger due at  had
passed

  i set my signals and busied myself
doing nothing until the south bound
should arrive i felt mighty glad of the
chance for human companionship which
the side-tracked freight would supply

   the sky had assumed a dirty-gray
color the clouds seemed to hang bal-
anced overhead without any sign of mo-
tion the temperature had dropped
quite perceptibly and from indications
i felt certain that there was a cyclone
sashaying around somewhere in my vicin-
ity

   i was wondering if my villa was in
the path of the whirling dervish when
the stillness was suddenly fractured by
the shrieking of the south bounds whis-
tle

   i got ready to do the reception act
and wondered why jim bludsoe kept his
whistle blowing

   in a few seconds the big engine
loomed in sight along she came like
a race-horse on the home - stretch and
suddenly i realized that the big galoot at
the throttle was going to give us the
go-by

    grabbed my red flag and got busy
with the wigwag performance but old
iron horse swished past with his long
brown tail of empty freights strung out
behind like the appendage of a comet

    what the sam hills the matter
with that gidcly choffer   thinks i then
it struck me all of a sudden that in about
seven and a half minutes there was going
to be trouble likewise a lot of scrap-iron
scattered over the scenery of the sun-
floaver state

   the north - bound train had already-
entered the same block and the two trains
would meet about half-way between my
bungalow and the next one south on the
curve around a grove thereabouts in
my mind i pictured the horror of the
scene

   say did you ever read  ben-hur  
do you remember the chariot-race and
how that gay lothario of the ghetto had
ornamental spikes on the hubs of his chug
car  then do you remember how when
coming up the home-stretch he spoke to
his team in yiddish and they spurted to
overtake the fellow on the lead
the vanished freight



   also do you remember how the bully
boy tacked a little to leeward so that by
the time the lead horses of the two teams
were neck to neck his chariot swung to-
ward that of mister-man-on-the-lead and
that harveyized toothpick on bully boys
chariot-hub slid in between the spokes of
the-other fellows wheel and there was a
sound like the tearing off of several yards
of dry noise and mister-man-on-the-leads
chariot turned turtle and benny-boy fin-
ished first amid the plaudits from the
bleachers and the showers of american
beauties from the grand stand and
boxes 

  you remember that do you well
thats the kind of noise i expected wjjjxid
vibrate the atmosphere of kansas in a
few minutes but as compared to this
noise the noise of that chariot-ptice would
sound like the joyful coo of a happy in-
fant

   my mind was full of the possibilities
of the situation and i was standing there
paralyzed as it were when suddenly there
was a roar and the topography of kansas
began doing the wilbur wright act

   i was picked up bodily and hurled
against that shanty of mine with sufficient
force to knock the sense out of me when
i came to i saw a train standing on the
siding the crew were emptying the con-
tents of a water-pail over me and search-
ing my anatomy for injuries

   as my gray matter resumed opera-
tions i realized that it was the north-
bound passenger-train that stood upon the
siding  how the sam hill did you get
here   i asked the engineer

    why came in on my engine he re-
plied  wheres no -isnt she in
yet i had orders to run through to x
and expected to see no  side-tracked
here not seeing anything on the siding
i pulled up to investigate whats up

  didnt you smash into  i
gasped

    sure not he replied  whats the
matter did you strike your head

    my heads all right i replied
 twenty-three passed here in a blaze of
glory some time ago and if you didnt see
her where is she  

    come man coaxed the engineer
get word along the line and find out when
she is due i dont want to stay here all
day

    	r r

    but i tell you she passed here i
insisted and in desperation i rushed to
the key and pounded off an inquiry to the
fellow south of me as to whether  had
passed

   the reply staggered me he an-
swered in the negative

  wheres that train i shrieked
 it passed here at  i persisted 
just then the rear brakeman came
running up the track with a cap in his
hand  found this down the track he
said thats old tim bludsoes cap
and if his cap is here he must have passed
here himself

    thats so rejoined the engineer
 but what am  going to do i cant
hang around here any longer

    well i wired to the northern end for
instructions and got word to send the
passenger along then the word went
over the line to the next station south
to send out a searching-party for the
missing train the track between my
shanty and the next one south was closed
to traffic pending the arrival of the
searching-crew in due time they pulled
in on a hand-car and reported that they
had seen nothing of the missing train
i wired the information to headquar-
ters and asked for instructions

   open up the road for traffic and
send men on foot to make a thorough
search for that train  we need it came
the answer

    i did as directed and sent the search-
ing-party down the track tolcl them to
spread out on either side of the track and
work along until they found the wreck
for i felt sure it must have run off the
track somewhere

   after they had been gone about fif-
teen or twenty minutes and i had raked
my brain for a solution of the matter i
heard a whistle away off in the distance
it sounded low appearing to come from
the south there was nothing due at my
place for an hour or so  so i thought at
first it was a relief-party coming up to
help solve the mystery but as the sound
continued and did not get any louder
i concluded that whatever it was it was
stationary	

   the sound kept up for about ten
minutes and then stopped i waited for
about half an hour and then i saw one of
the searching-party returning on the run


the railroad mans magazine

in the meantime headquarters had been
hammering me for news of the engine

   when the special courier arrived he
was winded  so i saw it was no use trying
to pump anything out of him until he got
through with his breathing exercises

   when he got his bellows working
again i learned that they had found jim
bludsoe and his train about three miles
down the road about a mile and a half
away from the track several of the cars
were standing on end but the engine and
the balance of the train were right side
up scattered over the face of the virgin
prairie

   the searchers had heard the whis-
tle and proceeded to investigate they
had found the wreck as reported with
old jim standing in the cab scared wild-
looking and battered

   how the heck did they get there
asked the watery-eved one

   well they couldnt get anything out
of jim he seemed plumb locoed when
i sent in my report over the wire they
sent down a lot of experts to try and
salvage the train jim bludsoe was the
only living critter left of the crew

   they figured that the cyclone had
caught up to the train on its wild whirl
down the track picked it up bodily like
a blooming air - ship and carried it
across the country to where it was dis-
covered this was verified by the crew
who came straying in like lost sheep from
the prairie whither they had blown

   it was learned from them that the
engineer had developed a crazy streak
some time before passing my station and
chased the fireman out of the cab that
explained why they gave my signal the
go-by however jim bludsoe never had
to answer for his crazy act for the last i
heard of him he was in a dippy domicile
quartered in an upholstered boudoir-
 and what became of the locomotive
and cars inquired the watery-eyed
one

   oh they built a mile and a half
of track out to the scene and the wreck-
ers salvaged the whole outfittlie strange
part of it is that a prosperous settlement
known as the lost freight sprung up
at the terminus

   but then that seems to be the cus-
tom in kansas whenever any of the
real estate is shifted by a cyclone the
natives send a tracer after it and if it is
found in good order they migrate to the
spot

  why ive seen the same family liv-
ing in the same house in a half-dozen
different counties its a cheap way to
move and besides you dont have to
bother about the selection of a site

   thats so replied the watery-eyed
one  you dont happen to be related
to anner nias do you

   no replied the loose-jointed indi-
vidual  my familiars call me monk
hausen so long pard thanks for a
very entertaining afternoon

doubt about hudson bay r r

many doubts and rumors of doubts
have been going the rounds since it
was announced that the canadian govern-
ment planned to build a line from winni-
peg-to hudson bay the ice-bound condi-
tion of the bay during a considerable por-
tion of the year and the bleak and unsettled
nature of the country through which the
line would have to pass have been quoted
as insurmountable objections to the scheme

  the recent preliminary report of the sur-
veying party sent out by the government
however  will set at rest many of these
doubts though it does not bring a final
decision the surveyors report that a line
could be built easily and cheaply either to
port churchill or port nelson

  they estimate that the cost including
harbor and terminal works would be be-
tween seventeen and eighteen million dol-
lars the engineers favor the line to port
nelson as that point is some sixty miles
nearer winnipeg and the port is ice-free
for about one month longer than is port
churchill

  the country through which it passes is
also much better adapted for agriculture
in spite of this report however the govern-
ment will take  further steps toward the
construction of the line until it has fuller
evidence that the bay is open for naviga-
tion for a sufficiently long period each year
to warrant the establishment of steamship
lines
finding the secret of the
automatic coupler

by e l bacon

life-saving inventions rank first in importance in the field of human
ingenuity an invention that saves a man time and worry that enables
business to be transacted in double the volume of former standards
can be hailed with delight but the life-saving device is hailed with a thank-
fulness that has in it considerable of reverence of all life-saving devices it
is doubtful if one can be found to rank with the automatic coupler every
year more men were sacrificed to the link and pin than in battles that have
decided the fate of hemispheres and to janney and miller belongs the undis-
puted glory of having saved thousands of the countrys sturdiest sons and
what positions some of those sons have filled none can tell

the toll of human lives that was paid before a genius among
eight thousand men found a way to prevent
the slaughter

were frittered away in the search for the
true secret of its mechanism and the
labor of thousands of inventors ended in
disappointment for a generation the
automatic coupler was a will-o-the-wisp
to half the inventive genius of the
country

  perhaps no other invention had ever
been attempted by quite so many men-
certainly no other that when at last it
was accomplished seemed so simple it
was a search as popular as absorbing as
heart-rending as was that of the medieval
alchemists for a way of transmuting
gold

	

iie automatic car-coupler
which fastens by impact
and is unfastened by the
turn of a handle seems
like a simple contrivance
the invention of which
could not have called for unusual me-
chanical ingenuity to-day the auto-
matic coupler is used on every railroad
car in america yet from the time men
first began to work upon the idea at
least thirty years passed by before the
device was perfected so that it could be
put into general use

  during that period scores of fortunes


the railroad mans magazine

  surely even the long-lived delusion of
the possibility of perpetual motion never
obsessed more dreamers of a mechanical
turn of mind than did this effort to
couple railroad cars automatically and
instantaneously without risk to life or
limb

  one wonders when one examines the
modern coupler which is far from being
a complex piece of mechanism that it
took so long to perfect it or that thou-
sands failed in their efforts to find the
secret

the coupler fever

  in  four thousand patents had
been granted at washington for auto-
matic couplers and twelve years later
the number had grown to eight thousand
it is doubtful if two per cent of these
eight thousand inventions ever brought
a penny of profit

  it was in the late forties that the
effort to make an automatic coupler was
begun and for forty years afterward-
in fact for fifteen years after the solu-
tion of the problem-coupler inventors
were haunting the offices of every rail-
road in the country

  they came in swarms inventors with
long hair and wild eyes who dreamed
of becoming millionaires within the year
and others sober-minded practical men
many of whom seemed to have come close
to the heart of the mystery

  when the fever was at its height the
traffic manager of a railroad would find
a line of coupler inventors stretching
from his door down the hall like a long
snake every one of them with a miniature
train of cars in all kinds of receptacles

   perhaps fifty per cent of the hordes of
inventors would succeed in getting a
hearing if one of them succeeded in
getting through the skirmish lines of
office-boys and clerks who were accus-
tomed to shoo them away as if they were
book-agents or pedlers he would lay
out a miniature railroad track on the
floor of the officials office then he
would set his cars on the rails and bang
them together with terrific force to illus-
trate the workings of his contrivance

  but somewhere there was a weak
point in every one of these inventions
it was astonishing how many things

there were to be considered in the making
of a successful coupler the problem of
curves was the pitfall that proved the
undoing of many of the enthusiasts

  they had failed to realize that a
coupler that would not turn to right and
left at the knuckle would be serviceable
only on an absolutely straight track of
course there are inventors with such
buoyant optimism that they are not dis-
couraged when confronted with such an
obstacle as that

    that is not the fault of my coupler
said one of them  it is the fault of
your railroad whats the matter with
relaying your tracks and taking the
curves out

  at last a coupler inventor came along
whose idea did come into practical use
he was colonel ezra miller of the
horse artillery a dashing figure was
the colonel in new york city in the
forties especially when on parade in his
showy uniform at the head of his na-
tional guard regiment

  he had traveled on the first trains in
the country in the days when stage-
coach bodies were placed on trucks and
run on strap rails railroads had had
a fascination for him from their be-
ginning

  he would spend hours watching the
trains go by on the harlem road until
in ss he moved to magnolia wis-
consin to survey state lands there he
became a justice of the peace and later
because of his fame as commander of the
horse artillery in new york the gov-
ernor appointed him colonel of the
eighth regiment of the wisconsin mili-
tia still he continued to spend almost
all his spare time studying railroads

   in those days the platform buffer and
coupler were placed below the sills of
the car although the sills are the line of
resistance to any longitudinal blow the
colonel saw the folly of this and real-
ized that it added greatly to the dangers
of travel often it was responsible for
the telescoping of cars in collisions

  he determined that the platform
coupler and buffer should be placed on
a line with the sills that the cars should
be coupled with compression buffers and
with couplers that fastened by impact
in lsf he patented the  miller plat-
form coupler and buffer
finding the secret of the automatic coupler 

  the coupler was automatic-the first
automatic coupler ever put into service
moreover it prevented the oscillating
movement of cars acting independently
when coupled with slack links or chains
a movement that caused many broken
rails and the violent whirling of rear
cars from the track the compression
buffers made the train a solid whole

extra hazardous labor

  but although the colonels invention
was hailed as the greatest life-saving
discovery of the age and was adopted
before long by every large railroad in
the world the great coupler problem
was not solved by any means the
miller coupler which is referred to now-
adays as the  miller hook was in-
tended only for passenger-trains and
the coupler problem pertained princi-
pally to freight-cars there being about
forty times as many freight-cars as pas-
senger-cars in service in this country 

  while the hook backed by the elabo-
rate platform and buffer was a great
improvement on the old link and pin it
would be impossible to apply it to a
freight-car then too the hpok did not
always work instantaneously and some-
times cars had to be banged together two
or three times before fastening

  hundreds of men were being killed
and thousands injured every year be-
cause of the lack of an automatic freight-
car coupler with only a few thousand
passenger-cars in use and hundreds of
thousands of freight-cars the adoption
of the miller hook had scarcely a per-
ceptible effett upon the number of acci-
dents

  it was dangerous business coupling
cars in those days there has never
been anything more disastrous to life and
limb than the old link-and-pin coupler
and it is only ten years since the last of
them went to the scrap-heap

  mutilated men were a common sight
in railroad yards an instants delay in
lifting the link and slipping it into place
might mean the loss of a hand or an
arm hundreds of lives were crushed
out between the heavy beams that acted
as buffers at the ends of the cars

  it was intended that there should be
enough space between these buffers for

a mans body but all cars were not the
same in this respect and sometimes the
buffers came close together a man en-
gaged in coupling cars had to be on
a constant watch to see that there was
going to be enough space left for him
when the cars should come togethe

  uncoupling was almost as dangerous
it had to be done with the cars in mo-
tion  and at night in the uncertain light
of a swinging lantern it was not uncom-
mon for a man running along between
the cars to slip and go under the wheels

  during the years   and 
the average annual number of men killed
in this country while coupling cars was
four hundred and fifty-nine and the
number injured seventeen thousand eight
hundred and fifty a total of eighteen
thousand three hundred and nine-more
casualties during one year than were suf-
fered by the union army on the bloody
field of gettysburg

  confronted with such figures as these
there began to be a public awakening to
the necessity of putting an end to the
slaughter the master car builders
association took a hand in the matter
and its members bbgan to demand a
standard type of coupler

  clearly a standard type was a neces-
sity since no railroads freight-cars were
confined to its own lines the associa-
tion appointed a committee to look into
the matter

the weeding process

  the committee looked over the field
to discover an automatic coupler that
would fit all requirements and they
found a few thousand kinds to choose
from the hungry coupler inventors
scarcely any of whom had succeeded in
marketing their wares came down upon
the committee like a vast army equipped
with diagrams and models

  it was decided to hold a series of tests
to determine which was tne most satis-
factory of all the couplers offered in
 the associations committee held
trials at buffalo with the intention of
recommending twelve makes

  they expected a horde of inventors at
these trials as a matter of fact only
forty-two kinds of couplers were pre-
sented for the tests most of the rest


the railroad mans magazine

had not been brought out by the inchoate
model stage

  as a result of the tests the committee
chose six automatic couplers of the link-
and-pin type and six known as vertical-
plane couplers so called because they
came together on a vertical plane a
year later the committee held further
trials at albany where thirty-three kinds
of couplers were tried

  at boston in the same year one hun-
dred and seventy-three couplers were
entered for competition before the mas-
sachusetts state railroad commissioners

  the master car builders at last picked
out the one coupler that they considered
the most satisfactory of the lot it was
a coupler of the vertical-plane type and
had been invented by eli h janney
who at that time was unknown

  janney had been brought up on a
farm in virginia for fifteen years he
had been experimenting in an attempt
to solve the coupler problem and as
early as  had hit upon the design to
which the master car builders gave first
place for five years after getting his
patent he had tried in vain to interest
railroads in his invention

  his original invention was a passen-
ger-car coupler and for passenger-cars
the railroads were using the miller hook
and did not care to go to the expense of
making a change at last the pennsyl-
vania took a fancy to his coupler for
their passenger-cars

  then in  using the same contour
lines for the clutching part of the ap-
paratus he invented an automatic freight
coupler and it was this i-nvention that
won out in the master car builders tests

janneys two devices

  janneys first invention consisted of a
coupler body with a bifurcated head and
a revolving hook or knuckle with a ver-
tical lock actuated by a flat spring lock-
ing automatically on the closing move-
ment of the knuckle his invention of
 had a vertically moving locking-
pin especially suited to freight service

  as the rules of the master car build-
ers prohibited them from adopting any
device covered by a patent however
they succeeded in inducing the parties in
interest to waive their patent rights to

the janney contour lines this opened
the field for other inventors and manu-
facturers to come in and furnish coup-
lers having the contour lines that the
association had adopted but with differ-
ent locking mechanisms

  even now the battle was only half
won it would cost a good many mil-
lions of dollars to equip all the freight-
cars with automatic couplers

  the railroads didnt care to spend the
money congress had to take a hand
and in  the safety appliance act
was passed that compelled the roads to
use automatic couplers on all cars giv-
ing them until august  to complete
the reform

the vanished horde

  to-day in spite of the fact of the
eight thousand patents that have been
granted there are not more than fifteen
makes of couplers in general use all
having janneys contour lines which the
master car builders made the standard
some of the manufacturers bought up
several of the patents to combine them
into one coupler but it is safe to say that
considerably less than two hundred of
the eight thousand were ever sold

  the making of automatic freight-
couplers is exclusively an american in-
dustry in the british isles and in the
european countries they use screw coup-
lers which take several minutes to fasten
and the old link and pin american
manufacturers have tried many and many
a time to induce the englishmen to make
a change but without success

  not one of the horde of coupler in-
ventors made any great fortune very
few made anything but colonel mil-
lers platform buffer and hook brought
him a quarter of a million dollars and
janney is supposed to have made a good
deal more than that

  still not every inventor who has
achieved great wealth has contributed so
much toward saving human life as mil-
ler and janneyi no man loses his life or
is maimed nowadays in --this country
while coupling cars if it were not for
the automatic coupler the number of
killed and wounded taking into consid-
eration the increased number of cars
would be more than fifty thousand a year
 a track-walkers devotion

by edmund g kinyon

hphe true story series even the unbalanced mind
a leans to the instinct of preserving human life this bit of history
shows how duty can become so prominent a part of a mans life that the
idea of it lives on after all but the merest physical vitality has departed in
the old track-walkers case physical life is in fact secondary to and probably
dependent upon this overpowering instinct to accomplish what he believes
to be his mission

true story number thirty-eight

how an old mans task has become the unbroken thread that
has held him to life after the light of
reason failed

fames drum golds name
does not appear upon the pay-
 roll of the southern pacific
company yet for more than
twenty years he has patrolled
the seven hundred miles of
desert track stretching between losan-
geles california and el paso texas
he has rendered as faithful service as
any other track-walker in the pay of the
company

  there is deep pathos in this story of
drumgold or  crazy charley as he
is known all along the way it is a
striking example of that devotion to an
imaginary duty which ofttimes possesses
a mind which has slightly left its moor-
ings drumgold is old and gray and
his body is bent and worn with years of
heavy labor and exposure yet no in-

fluence can induce him to desist from his
self-imposed task

  he is a martyr to a deranged intellect
an intellect which forces his tired body
to this endless pilgrimage in the belief
that the safety and lives of thousands of
passengers depend upon his faithfulness

  many years ago when the southern
pacific was first built across the desert
drumgold was employed as track-walker
in a lonely section for a number of
years he performejl his duties in a most
trustworthy manner then somehow the
great desert with its sameness and mys-
tery and solitude got into his brain and
he saw queer visions and conversed with
unseen persons as he went about his tasks

  rumors of his condition reached the
superintendents office and in due time
an order was issued discharging drum-

gold from the service of the company
and another man was sent to take his
place

  but drumgold argued with himself
that harm would surely come to the pas-
sengers and trainmen should he cease to
patrol the track so he disregarded the
order and continued his inspection
heretofore he had patrolled only a few
miles of track now he resolved to patrol

the entire desert and that is what he
has been doing for the past twenty years

  every trainman is familiar with the
bent worn figure of  crazy charley
although he avoids the towns and is sel-
dom seen by the residents of the country
through which he passes the trainmen
sight him daily at some point along the
way trudging beside the tracks labori-
ously carrying a roll of blankets a little
cooking kit and a canteen of water

  he stoutly refuses all invitations to
ride asserting that he must walk in
order to do his work properly his eyes
are constantly upon the track every
foot of rail is scrutinized every bridge
and culvert and cattle guard inspected
no high-salaried engineer is more pains-
taking and tireless

  -drumgolds vigil has not been entire-
ly in vain in at least two instances he
has prevented disastrous
wrecks one night a pas-
senger-train was flagged
in a deep winding canon
and when the crew ran
forward they found
crazy charley shrink-
ing against the wall of
the cut

  the train proceeded
slowly and just around
the bend a blazing bridge
was found in another
instance a cloudburst
washed out a section of
track an approaching
freight-train found dan-
ger signals between the
rails but there was no
one in sight later it
was learned that drum-
gold had placed the sig-
nals and then hid from
view

  mauy times he has
given section bosses and
road -masters in-
formation concerning
defective track or
weakened bridges and
such information has al-
ways been found relia-
ble

  many efforts have been
made to induce drum-
gold to give up his weary
wandering at first the company feared
that evil might come from his presence
and he was ordered repeatedly to stay
off of the right of way but he always
ignored the orders

  wealthy relatives have pleaded with
him in vain at one time a brother ob-
tained a promise from him that he would
remain in one place provided a house
was built a comfortable cottage was
accordingly erected at cabazon cali-

the trainmen sight him daily at some point along the
way trudging beside the tracks
a track-walrers devotion

fornia near the railway track and com-
pletely furnished

  the old track-walker seemed satis-
fied and agreed to remain there the re-
mainder of his days he slept in his
new house just one night then started
for el paso five hundred miles eastward

  recently this same brother resolved
to make another effort to rescue the old
man from his life of hardship he ob-
tained permission to ride the call of
freight-engiues and spent several days
in search before locating the wanderer

  finally far out on the salton desert
twenty miles from a station the old man
was sighted at dusk squatting beside his
tiny camp-fire the train was stopped
and he was taken half forcibly aboard

  the brothers left the train at indio

and spent the night at the town hotel
 crazy charley  went to bed faith-
fully promising to accompany his brother
to san francisco in the morning he
was gone during the night he had
arisen and started on his endless journey

  summer and winter storm and sun-
shine are alike to drumgold nothing
deters him from his daily pilgrimage
along the track those who have taken
note of his movements assert that he
averages the round trip of seven hun-
dred miles between los angeles and el
paso once each year

  so far as known he never proceeds
beyond those cities although they by no
means mark the confines of the southern
pacific system why he has selected this
particular stretch of track is a mystery

 why he doesnt like uppers

they would be all right says the traveler if provided with a
private elevator and a dressing-room

    ake it from a man who has tipped
sleeping-car porters from montreal
to pensacola and from seattle to san
diego said an old traveler to a writer for
the washington d c post the upper
berths on sleeping-cars ought to be abolished
on general principles and the minneapolis
man who has complained to the interstate
commerce commission about them and who
wants them put at a lower rate than lower
berths has a drink coining when i meet him

  of course there are a few fresh-air
fiends who stand out for the uppers and
aver they are superior to the lowers but
the great majority of travelers utter inde-
corous remarks when the man behind the
ticket-window says  the best i can do is
an upper

   uppers would be all right if each one
were equipped with a private elevator and
had a dressing-room attached but the dis-
comforts which they provide offset the ad-
vantages which are claimed for them about
three times over

  ill admit that there is a freer circula-
tion of air up there sometimes its so free
that the doctors get a nice thing out of it
also if the ventilators arent working prop-
erly theres sometimes a free circulation of
black smoke which is a bit disconcerting
to put it mildly

  the climbing up is what gets me you
have to wait your turn for the ladder while
the lucky chaps in the lowers make facetious
remarks which are calculated to disturb
your balance when once you do get your
feet planted on the ladder then when you
once get up and find yourself sitting on the
edge with your feet dangling over the aisle
you are confronted with the problem of un-
dressing

   when you get some of your things off
and start to hang them up you find that
youve got to disturb the serenity of the
person in the lower berth if you want them
to hang right so that they wont be all clut-
tered up across your feet

   you have to pull out the curtain and let
them fall down below the level of your bed
once when i did that a fussy old maid
who occupied the lower berth and who had
apparently noted my operations with grow-
ing alarm called out in a shrill voice warn-
ing me against invading her privacy and
threatening to sick the porter  me

 after youre once wrapped up in the
blankets there is a certain sense of freedbm
up there that you dont get in the more
confined lowers and if there arent many
tunnels with their accompanying smoke you
sleep pretty well but when it conies to get-
ting up your troubles arc renewed
mcallisters grouch

    by charles wesley sanders

     when he found out who the operator
     at mx was it vanished like the mist

callisters promotion
had been rapid he
had blown into the chief
despatch ers office one
afternoon and asked for
a job having ridden
from the western terminal in a caboose
pie had answered questions satisfactorily
and the chief had sent him to a way-
station to work nights

   say that man at bg is a whirl-
wind the third - trick man said next
morning  he sends like a machine
and  never had to call him moren
twice

   think hed be all right copying up
here   the chief asked

  the copier on the third trick had quit
the week before and the chief had been
hesitating whom to put in his place
there were of course any number of
operators who could have done the work
but the chief wanted a man who had the
making of a despatcher

  so when mcallister came to work the
next night he found a message ordering
him to report for duty on the third trick
at the despatchers office in twenty-four
hours he came-a tall dark - haired
blue-eyed young man-who spoke only
when business demanded it and who
eternally smoked a long thick very
black cigar

  everybody admired him on the spot
for his ability but he made no friends
personally when he was spoken to he
answered with a nod when pressed by
a monosyllable when necessary

  sometimes he was almost discourteous
the chief dropped in one night while
the despatcher was at luncheon and
wanted to know where  was

   its on the sheet mcallister said

shifting his big cigar and leaning back
in his chair

  the chief had a notion to speak
sharply but he only looked at the sheet
and went into his own office

   i wonder whats eating that fel-
low he said to the trick - man when
they met on the stairs a little later

  hes a queer fish the trick - man
said  i feel like smashing him one
in the jaw sometimes but im afraid i
couldnt get away with it

  the reason for mcallisters grouch
was very simple and as old as the race
pie had been disappointed in love like
all persons who have been so disappoint-
ed he kept on thinking about the girl
he had her picture always with him
and wrote a letter to her every night-
and then tore it up after the letter-
writing he would pace his room

   ill be hanged if ill pay any more
attention to her he would say and
then he would dwell upon her looks and
her ways till his heart was like lead
and then his grouch would sjveep over
him like a flood till he was immersed

  he had worked his way to the first
trick on the road where he had learned
telegraphy her father was the chief
mcallister and the girl became engaged
the father died unwise investments
had taken all his money

  even the home had to be sold to meet
debts the girl had a mother and a
sister to care for the mother was in-
capable of effort for herself and the
sister was too young to do much at
breadwinning the superintendent gave
the girl a place as a telegrapher in the
yard office mcallister was furious

  what are you going to work for
he demanded
mcallisters gro ucii



   we must live she said

  im working am i not he asked

   why yes the girl said gently
 but-

  she paused and looked at him appeal-
ingly he had a temper and looked at
things simply

   but you couldnt let me help you
ll finished for her

  his anger rose higher to think of
her going to work made bis blood boil
according to his way of thinking she
might easily have let him take care of
the family or she might have married
him at once but he was too angry now
to suggest that latter

   you are speaking harshly she said
still gently

  he fumbled for a cigar

   well he said slowly and his voice
was harder and more bitter
than he was justified in letting
it be  well if im not good
enough to help you we might
as well call it quits

  he had not meant quite that

he had no idea of giving her
up but he hurt her so that
her own temper rose she
straightened herself and looked
at him kindly

   you are going rather far
arent you  she asked

   why no ill go farther
than that if i like

 indeed she rose and
walked to the door  you may
come to see me again when you
can act like a gentleman

then she left him

  he sat for a moment listen-
ing for her return there were
two closed doors between him
and the sound of her weeping

he arose and left slamming
the door behind him he heard
next morning that she had gone
to work

  he resigned to the chief des-
patcher as soon as that official
came to the office the chief
knew that it was futile to question or
argue and he accepted the resignation
with a sigh mcallister was a good man
-too good to lose in spite of his pecu-
liarities

  and now he was working a trick on

a road two hundred miles away but ever
she dwelt in his heart he grew sad-
der and colder and sterner and she do-
ing the task she had set herself to do
wondered how he was and whether he
ever thought of her

  for lovers quarrels partake of such
folly and madness

  the first-trick man was ill mcal-
lister and the second-trick man were di-
viding the time-mcallister working
from midnight till noon this gave him
two sets of operators to work with the
day men and the night men he had
got the night men trained because they
were afraid of his speed and his sharp
way of doing business but he had had
one or two wire fights with the day men

  whos that man at mx he asked
the chief

  the chief smiled and opened his lips
to reply then he seemed to change his
mind he finished a message he was
writing mcallister repeated his ques-
tion with a frown

   oh thats somebody the superin-


the railroad mans magazine

tendent of telegraph sent over when i
asked for a man i havent seen him
we were so rushed we didnt even
give him the color examination

   well hes a ham said mcallister
 i should think we might get a better
class of operators

   howre they moving he asked the
second-trick man when he came on

   rotten said the second-trick
man  theres been a heavy rain
west and there was a little washout at
dascom mx says its sleeting there
to beat the band i had
the general office set the
repeaters in here but its
pretty heavy yet

  he pulled up to show
how heavy the wire was

mcallister slipped into a

 you may come to see me
when you can act like
a gentleman

  he administered a smarting rebuke be-
cause the operator hadnt had sense
enough to pull up in heavy weather
the operator offered an apology and
mcallister snapped open his key

  what are you working for he de-
manded  wheres the night-man 
he had recognized the sending of the

chair and began to make dots firmly
even on that leaking line

   i guess you can put it through the
second-trick man said

  mcallister spent a few minutes get-
ting terminals to see how they were ad-
justed as he was calling an office mx
broke and began calling him mcallis-
ter tried to break but mx was not ad-
justed

  he waited till the operator closed his
key then he called the office nearest
mx and told the operator there to get
mx adjusted that operator did so
and mcallister was soon able to make
mx understand

man he had previously and politely des-
ignated as a  ham

   hes sick was the nervous reply
 ill have to work to-night

   well its going to be bad mcal-
lister said  you want to keep on the
job

  it proved to be very bad indeed fog
was reported all along the line with
sleet and rain in spots mcallister
never took his hand from the key or his
eyes from the sheet

  toward midnight what he had feared
happened a train slipped between
spreading rails not much damage was
done but another train jamming along
mcallisters grq uch

 

in the mist ran into the first one and the
cars went all over the right-of-way

  a fireman had a broken leg but none
other was injured mcallister tele-
phoned the trainmaster and in an hour
he was speeding west in a special

  mcallister called an office to give an
order to the special that office an-
swered promptly and mcallister called
the yard office there was no reply
a while before the operator at the yard
had said that the yardmaster thought
there would be no  but that train had
not yet been annulled mcallister
knowing the yard-man would report 
ready sent this order to the trainmasters
special

number forty-nine of this date is

   annulled

  that sent the special speeding against
 so far as technicalities were con-
cerned without  having been an-
nulled

  a little later the operator nearest the
wreck sent a report from the conductor
of the train which had gone into the one
derailed mcallister called mx and
mx answered promptly

   msg for extra west mcallister
said sm fine

  which meant that he had a message
for the special and that the message was
some fine or long sending long
messages was mcallisters forte his
morse was perfect his spacing being as
if cut out with a knife

  mx did not break for the first hun-
dred words the wire seemed to be
working better mcallisters speed in-
creased till his sounder sang mx broke
and then broke again mcallister slowed
down mx got started again and mc-
allister once more speeded up

  mx broke nervously and then again
more nervously mcallister slowed
down again but still mx broke once
the operator held open his key for twenty
seconds while mcallister fumed at the
vacant wire when mx said  go
ahead mcallister shot a short but ugly
word over the wire

   never mind he said  ill send it
to bx

  the man at bx was an old-timer and
he had a typewriter so that mcallister
could not put it up his back

   theres some sense to you mcal-
lister said at the finish for he admired
good work as much as he loathed poor

  the operator at mx heard with burn-
ing cheeks the pperator at mx was
well aware that the operator at bx was
a better telegrapher but that was no rea-
son why mcallister should rub it in

  then fates finger touched the proud
mcallister

  the yard operator reported  ready
the yardmaster having scared up enough
loads for a train the yard operator
asked for orders mcallister said there
were none

  forty-nine pulled out and glided away
through the mist at the scene of the
wreck they let her through the siding
and she sped merrily eastward while the
trainmasters special bore down upon her
from the east

   oss  came from offices along the
line reporting  and the special by
mcallister studied the sheet and kept
things moving well considering the
weather and the fact that he had a bad
wreck on his hands

  presently he wanted to put out an
order to  to meet a train at a siding
near mx he called mx

  think you can copy an order he
asked

    ill try the operator meekly said

  mcallister called a station ten miles
down the line the station answered
promptly and mcallister started his
order

  to no  mx he began and
then mx broke

   forty-nines gone was the laconic
report

   why didnt you report them com-
ing mcallister snapped

   you didnt tell me to

  mcallister knew he had not done so
but the fact of his omission only made
him more angry he started a smart-
ing rebuke when the station east of mx
broke in

   os os the operator said slowly
special west by  am with one
coach

   mcallister shot his eye down the sheet
then he knew for a moment strange-
ly he had no sense of shock or horror
he was only filled with a great wonder
that he the most careful of men should


the railroad mans magazine

have made this colossal blunder while
he had been sitting here in his chair in
a warm office he had been letting men
go forth to their crashing death it was
rank stupidity

  he leaned back in his chair and
closed his eyes first he disposed of
himself he had a notion of flight-the

   its pretty slippery and foggy the
engineer said

   never mind weve got to get over
there

  mcallister had so much on his mind
that he had no sense of fear he sat
chewing his cigar while his scowling
eyes sought to pierce the gray - black

inevitable swift emotion in such cases
-and then he decided to stay and face
the music that was more his way

  action followed swiftly he called
the yard office and ordered an engine
got ready on the instant

   stick some box cars behind her
he said  i want to make time

  then he called a couple of doctors
who lived near by and gave orders put-
ting everything in to clear for his spe-
cial of an engine and two box cars
slipping into his heavy coat he ran down
the stairs and hastened to the yard of-
fice the doctors came presently

  whats up the operator asked

  mcallister only scowled and went out
to the engine with the two doctors he
crowded into the engine-cab

   you can let her out he told the
engineer

  l guess im not getting
along very well the des-
patches hasnt shown me
much consideration

bank ahead it was characteristic of him
that he had no moment of despair he
only wanted to get to the wrecked train
to help those whom his carelessness had
injured then he would decide upon
the next move

  through his plans shot a thought of
anna he wished that she had not been
so stubborn they might have been hap-
pily married if he had had her safely
in a little home of their own he would
not be in his present predicament
worry had made him unstable he
mcallisters grouch



had had nothing to care for-nothing to
work for

   were near mx he said  why 
he strained his eyes  why that
chump has got the block against us
heaven what a ham that fellow is
whistle him  he ordered the engineer

  the whistle screeched mcallister
kept his eyes on a tiny point of light that
showed red through the fog-bank he
wanted it to disappear he knew mx
had no orders for this train but there
might be something wrong somewhere
that little flickering light could not be
ignored

   youll have to stop he told the en-
gineer through his set teeth  ill go
in and murder that fellow

  they were a hundred yards beyond the
telegraph office when the engine slid to a
standstill mcallister jumped down
bidding the engineer to stay where he
was

   ill be back in a minute he said

  he strode to the office slipping now
and then on the soft clay the sleet
and the mist had coated the windows so
that lie could not see inside the office

with a touch of anger he threw open the
door and stepped in

   what have you got that block
against us for lie cried as he sprang
to the door which separated the outer
room from the telegraph office  didnt
i put everything in to clear

  he threw open the door and as he
stopped  the threshold the operator
rose to face him her back to the table

  mcallister gasped the operator was
a slim white-faced tired-looking young
woman her brown eyes were wide now
with astonishment and her lips were
tremulous

  mcallister was sure she was about to
cry she put up her hand and brushed
back her soft hair it was a well-re-
membered gesture - one of her most
charming

   anna   mcallister breathed

   well she whispered

   what are you doing here

  she laughed uncertainly

   im working she said  that is
im trying to work i guess im not get-
ting along very well the despatcher
hasnt shown me much consideration i

you saved me little girl


the railroad mans magazine

 told him the night-man was sick and i
 thought he would bear in mind how long
 i had worked

    it was inconsequential talk to cover
  her confusion but it was sweet to mc-
  allisters ears

   how do you happen to be here
 he asked

     i dont happen to be here she said
   i came here on purpose i came to
  see you  meant to go straight to you
  but then i lost my nerve i asked the
  superintendent for a place and for
  fathers sake he got me in here without
  any of the usual red tape i heard you
  were half sick and irritable and mother
  didnt need me any more i dont know
  whether you heard but we found some
  insurance papers of fathers those
  gave mother enough-

  -	 anna-anna   mcallister broke in

  you have come too late im a ruined
 man i cant ever get on my feet again
 the despair was so unlike him that it
 made the girl shudder it was as if
 some strong thing upon which she had
 leaned had suddenly grown weak

   why is that she asked

     i sent an extra against  to-night
  i expected to annul  but i forgot it
  i dont understand how i ever did it

      heard you send the order to the
 extra the girl said  i knew you
 hadnt annulled  i heard you let 
 out of the yards too

     oh anna  the dispatcher cried
 why didnt you tell me

     i tried she replied and he thought
  her voice was cheerful under the circum-
  stances   but you wouldnt let me
  dont you remember i tried to break
  three times when  was coming

     yes and i told you to stop he
 admitted reluctantly

     well i mustnt sit here any longer
  weve got to get over there and see how
  bad it is

    the girl went close to him

     why dont you wait till the extra
 comes 

    mcallister stared at her in amazement
     the extra is probably in the ditch

by now he said  dont you see that
it and  would meet head oh

   oh no she said she picked up a
manifold - book that lav on the table
 read this		-

  mcallister read

    number fort--nine engine  will
  run as extra east from alain crossing
  to edgerton extra east engine 
  and extra west engine  will meet at
  harland siding

   i grounded the wire and sent that to
the extra west the girl said  then
i put the block red so that i would hold
everything till the extra west got here
that made it safe didnt it 

  mcallister sat and stared at the sheet
of yellow tissue-paper in his hand the
hand for the first time within the girls
recollection trembled when mcallis-
ter looked up and spoke his face was
white and his voice trembled

   you saved me little girl he whis-
pered

   all youve got to do now is to fix
your sheet isnt it she asked

   thats all said mcallister  oh
of course i wont try to deceive them
ill tell the chief the whole truth i
guess i can still hold my job des-
patches are scarce in these parts

  they fell silent there was some-
thing more to say but neither knew how
to say it outside the engine which
had brought mcallister over whistled
sharply

   theyre getting impatient mcal-
lister said

  he rose and went to a window rub-
bing it with the palm of his hand but
the mist on the outside still covered the
pane he threw up the sash

   the extra west is coming anna
he said  ill have to do a little des-
patching from here

  he moved toward the table and the
girl stepped back he raised his eyes
and met hers they looked at each
other a full minute then he held out
his arms and took a step toward her

  with a laugh that was half a cry she
stepped toward him

speed and power of
the locomotive

by c f carter

whether the electric locomotive will ever supplant the steam-engine
as the chief railroad power cannot be said to be an actual problem
of operation at the present moment nevertheless the records of
both forms of motive power cannot help but bring up the suggestion that in
the very near future large districts will either because of peculiarities of
traffic or of country find it more economical to use electricity

   the purpose of the following article is to attempt to set forth some of
the statistics only of these records whether actual operation under identical
conditions would bring the same contrasts is a matter that can be dealt with
only when and where such operations have taken place as yet we fear
comparisons can only be of a somewhat general and experimental nature

there are some signs of discontent with the steel giant of the tracks
and many experiments are pointing
to electricity

sually the volume and
vociferousness of a mans
own account of what he is
doing has done is going
to do or could do if he
wanted to may safely be
set down as bearing an inverse ratio to
his actual achievements the same
principle applies to machines

  of all the machines ever invented
doubtless the average dweller near a
railroad believes that the locomotive
makes the most noise about its perform-
ances the act of hauling a few cars
across the country is made the occasion
of an uproat that can be heard for miles
series began in the august  railroad

 around a visitor from another planet
 might be pardoned for assuming the
 first time that fearful din assailed his
 ears that he had stumbled upon the
 main power-plant which keeps the uni-
 verse in motion

   yet as a matter of fact the locomo-
 tive is theoretically the most wasteful
 and most inefficient of prime movers it
 has been found by observation that a lo-
 comotive is engaged in useful work only
 one-fourth of the time it is fired up and
 under expense of the heat units in
 the coal shoved into its furnace but lit-
 tle more than half as many as would be
 rendered available by a stationary steam

power-plant notoriously inefficient as it
is are utilized

  to be of any use at all a locomotive
must have its steam pressure maintained
at the maximum under such conditions
it necessarily blows off frequently and
while the safety-valve is open shovels-
ful of coal are passing out of it in the
form of wasted steam finally the
amount of coddling and grooming that
a locomotive requires at the hands of its
engineer and fireman and hostlers and
wipers and coal-heavers and sand-men
and machinists and boiler - makers and
boiler-washers and so forth and so on
is beyond belief of any one but the
auditor under whose eyes the number-
less rivulets assemble in an appalling
flood of expense

need of close figuring

  of course the locomotive is render-
ing a service of such inestimable value
that a grateful world dislikes to look
too closely into the manner in which
that service is performed but the trans-
portation business has grown to such co-
lossal proportions that all thinking con-
cerning it must be done in millions and
that means millions outgoing as well as
incoming

  organized competition has reduced
the margin of profits nearly to the van-
ishing point and in some cases quite
beyond it and the true character of
the locomotive has become a matter of
transcendant importance research in
this subject has two distinct aims-first
to find if possible a more economical
motive-power than the steam locomotive 
second to secure immediate economy by
improving it as much as possible while
its successor is being developed

  in september  purdue univer-
sity bought an old - fashioned eight-
wheeler of the schenectady locomotive
works installed it in a testing labora-
tory and carried out with it a long se-
ries of experiments in the course of
which fifty thousand facts were accu-
mulated -prior to this each locomotive-
builder was apt to construct his engines
the way lie thought they ought to be
built

  if they did not give satisfaction he
built the next lot some other way if

that did not answer he went into bank-
ruptcy such tests as had been made
were carried out in a desultory sort of
way and while the results had consid-
erable individual value no comparisons
could be made and the data gathered
was practically jvorthless to the industry
in general

  about the time the test locomotive
was installed at purdue the american
railway master mechanics association
and the american society of mechanical
engineers held a conference at which
it was resolved to cooperate with the
university faculty in the experiments
in  the chicago and northwestern
railroad established a locomotive - test-
ing plant while a third was installed at
columbia university in 

  the locomotive-testing appliances ex-
hibited by the pennsylvania railroad at
the louisiana purchase exposition in
 was transferred to altoona where
a force of sixteen experts are still en-
gaged in testing an average of three lo-
comotives a week under such general
scrutiny the shortcomings of the loco-
motive have been made plain and con-
sequently many of them have been
eliminated

  one of the first things done at pur-
due was to attach the locomotive to a -
traction dynamometer so sensitive that a
man by pressing against the pilot with
his extended fingers could deflect the
dynamometer needle it was soon ascer-
tained that while the engine had a
draw-bar pull of  pounds at ten
miles an hour it had difficulty in attain-
ing a pull of  pounds when run-
ning at sixty miles an hour in spite
of all the locomotive-builders can do the
same ratio of speed to power holds good
to-day

 fuel through the exhaust

  in endeavoring to find out what be-
came of the coal that went into the fire-
box but did not come out at the drive-
wheels the purdue experimenters made
a discovery that throws a great deal of
light upon the frequent and disastrous
forest fires in the west and northwest
with apparatus to catch the sparks com-
ing out through a given area of the
smoke-stack it was proved that fourteen
speed and power of the locomotive

to twenty-one per cent of the fuel dis-
appears in that form

  another series of experiments under
service conditions on the road showed
that from one to five per cent of its
maximum capacity was lost by radiation
from a well-covered boiler when run-
ning at thirty miles an hour and from
two to seven per cent at sixty miles

  one of the most interesting experi-
ments was in the matter of counter-
balances a number of pieces of wire
a little longer than the circumference of
a driving-wheel were fed between the
driver in the rim of which a small notch
was cut to mark the position of the wheel
as the wire passed under and the sup-
porting wheel while the engine was run
at various speeds

impact of drivers

  these pieces of wire were visible for
an instant as a streak of light as they
shot through the air and struck the end
wall of the laboratory with violence

  an examination of them showed that
the driving-wheels were lifted clear of
the rail for one-tenth of each revolution
when going at high speed so that the
progress of the locomotive was marked
by a series of terrific hammer - blows
this was not surprising in view of the
fact that the reciprocating parts on each
side often weigh a thousand pounds or
more and the counterbalances as the
heavy weights in the wheels are called
three-fourths as much the wheels often
make three hundred revolutions a minute

  up to  it was thought that a
locomotive to haul heavy loads must have
small drivers but it was learned by ex-
periments that the draw-bar pull at the
engines best speed was not reduced by
increasing the diameter of the drivers
while the cylinder action was more effi-
cient the larger-wheeled engines were
more economical in coal and water

  the proper size of the smoke-stack
the size shape height and position of
the nozzle and a thousand and one lit-
tle details which up to that time had
been executed by rule of thumb pur-
suant to the untested theories of indi-
vidual builders were accurately deter-
mined by scientific experiment

the knowledge thus acquired has

made possible the development from the
passenger engine of fifteen years ago
with a tractive force of  pounds
and capable of hauling a light train be-
tween new york and chicago in twenty-
eight to thirty-two hours into a machine
weighing  pounds with a trac-
tive power of  iif  and to
haul a heavy private clubhouse on
wheels between the same points in eigh-
teen hours winter and summer

  freight engines have been developed
from a tractive power of  pounds
into the monster mallett articulated
compounds weighing  pounds
with a tractive force of  pounds
such an engine can haul a train of

	tons up a grade of  per cent
and around  degree curvas on level
track it would haul a train of  cars
a mile and a fifth long if the cars could
stand the strain

  having reached this stage of develop-
ment an entirely new set of problems is
presented for the cry of the directors is
always for heavier and therefore more
economical motive-power the limita-
tions imposed by the size of bridges and
tunnels have not quite been reached by
the locomotive-builders but the extreme
limit of the firemans muscle has

  the conditions on a locomotive are
such that only one fireman can work at
a time and only an exceptionally strong
man is capable of keeping these steel
monsters hot by the time he has done
this he is too exhausted to study the
fine points of engine-running so that
when his turn to be  set up  comes
lie is not qualified to assume the duties
of an engineer this introduces a com-
plication that is of great importance

developing stokers

  another complication arising from the
same conditions is the ever - growing
necessity of economizing in fuel and of
abating the smoke nuisance experts
agree that nine-tenths of this depends
upon good firing but when a man is
working to the limit of his endurance
lie cannot do his best work besides
there is the other tenth of the problem
for the solution of which some mechani-
cal device must be found 

this matter is becoming so pressing


the railroad mans magazine

that at its last meeting the master
mechanics association appointed a per-
manent committee to study the subject
of mechanical stokers up to the pres-
ent time four of the machines for firing
a locomotive that have been introduced
are regarded as promising but not as
entirely satisfactory yet

  some of the problems that perplex
railroad officials may seem trifling to an
outsider who does not stop to reflect that
if they were really trifling they would
not worry any one ne of these is the
temperature of the water used in wash-
ing out locomotive boilers

saving a score engines

  among the infinite attentions that a
steam locomotive constantly requires is
a thorough washing out once or twice
a week or even oftener depending upon
the quality of the water used in it if
the boiler is cooled off rapidly washed
out with cold water and then fired up
hurriedly the result is leaky flues and
broken stay-bolts caused by too violent
shrinkage and expansion of the metal by
sudden extreme changes of temperature

  leaky flues drown the fire so that the
locomotive cannot pull its load nor
make time thus throwing the whole
train service into confusion delaying
passengers and perhaps causing the loss
of perishable freight and furnishing ex-
tra work for the boiler-maker

  at last it occurred to some unknown
genius to install a plant to heat the
water used in boiler-washing it was
found that while three to six hours were
required to wash a boiler properly with
cold water making the necessary allow-
ances for cooling off and warming up
the job could be done much better in
fiftv-five minutes to three hours with hot
water and that the flues would not leak
afterward

  now a saving of two hours on each
washing for a thousand locomotives
amounts to  hours in a year it
would take twenty-two locomotives to
do that much work in a year which at
fifteen thousand dollars each would re-
quire an investment of three hundred
and thirty thousand dollars when the
great pennsylvania company has to sell
bonds at ninety-six to raise money for

needed improvements opportunities to
save little trifles of a third of a million
or more a year are very pleasing to the
perplexed officials

  but in spite of all that can be done
the task of handling the nations com-
merce has grown almost beyond the
capacity of the locomotive the earliest
practical recognition of this fact was
when the new york central planned
the reconstruction of its forty - second
street terminals in new york

  it was imperative that something bet-
ter than steam if such a thing existed
should be found to handle the swiftly
increasing traffic in order to know
definitely whether electricity would meet
the requirements the railroad company
ordered a full-sized electric locomotive
of the best type that the general elec-
tric companys experts could devise
built a six-mile experimental track at
schenectady and started the new motor
on an endurance run of fifty thousand
miles

  no piece of machinery has ever been
subjected to so severe a test in the whole
history of invention and no test ever
resulted in such a remarkable triumph
up and down to and fro day after
day in summer sun and winter storm
the electric locomotive plied on its six-
mile beat like a shuttle in a monster
loom at high speed at low speed and
all the speeds between dragging behind
it a train weighing from two hundred
to four hundred tons making service
stops and emergency stops and under-
going every conceivable test that could
come up under service conditions

a grueling test

  every detail of performance was ob-
served and recorded by merciless critics
and every legitimate item was charged
up against the locomotive when the
last mile of the fifty thousand had been
run it was found that the expense of
maintenance had been one and a fourth
cents a mile as compared with an ex-
pense of ten to eighteen cents a mile for
steam locomotives besides there had
been greater freedom from break-downs
and delays of course in actual opera-
tion this record could not be sustained 
but this in connection with the other
speed and power of the locomotive



tests has been accepted as an incon-
trovertible demonstration that the elec-
tric locomotive can haul heavier trains
at higher speeds than steam and with
equal reliability and greater economy

  it takes a pretty big steam locomotive
to develop two thousand horse-power
while electric locomotives are built of
three thousand four hundred horse-
power and even more besides two
or more electric locomotives can be
coupled together and operated as a unit
by one man to haul just as large a train
as the draft-irons will hold together

  an electric locomotive will develop
its full power at the maximum speed
for which it was designed which means
that it canx haul a full train up grade
at the same speed as on the level in-
stead of crawling up at five or six miles
an hour and perhaps doubling the hill
at last as a steam locomotive does

  in the new york central tests an
electric locomotive weighing ninety-five
tons of which seventy tons were on the
drivers was able to exert a draw - bar
pull of  pounds up to thirty-five
miles an hour the speed for which it
was designed while a pacific type
steam locomotive weighing one hundred
and seventy-one tons of which seventy
tons was on the drivers could exert a
draw-bar pull of only  pounds at
twenty miles an hour  pounds at
thirty milesan hour and but a beggarly

	pounds at thirty-five miles an
hour thus the adoption of- electric-
power would do away with the necessity
of spending millions to reduce grades as
all the roads that could raise the mil-
lions have been doing for some time
past

buying water-power

  from thirty to fifty per cent more
traffic can be handled on a given road
by electricity than by steam the cost
of electrical equipment is only a fraction
of the cost of the additional tracks
which would otherwise be necessary

  the problem of bad water which is
making so much trouble for the steam
locomotives and causing great expense
to the railroad companies has no ter-
rors for the electric locomotive for it
uses no water except at the generating

station beside some mountain torrent
hundreds of miles away finally the
increase of tractive-power makes pos-
sible an increase in traffic capacity thus
reducing running expenses

  the significance of the showing made
by the electric locomotive under elabo-
rate tests may be better appreciated
when it is known that very soon after
the fifty - thousand - mile endurance run
was completed at schenectady the new
york central secured by purchase on
long-term lease rights to  elec-
tric horse-power at niagara falls part
of which is already developed a
hydro-electric plant of iso horse-
power is now being installed on the st
joe river in idaho to operate trains
on the pacific extension of the chicago
milwaukee and st paul a power-
plant of  horse-power is being
installed on the feather river in cali-
fornia to operate the mountain division
of the western pacific while the great
northern is now operating its trains
through the noted cascade tunnel by
electricity

millions of horse-power

  all these facts taken together would
seem to indicate that the great problem
of motive-power for the railroad of the
future is regarded in some quarters at
least and under certain conditions as
pretty well settled

  not all railroads are in reach of
niagara falls or the magnificent water-
powers of the cascade range but there
will be no dearth of cheap power to
keep their electric locomotives going for
all that as the most effective and
economical and indeed the only effect-
ive way to control the flow of the ohio
and mississippi to prevent the millions
of dollars damage those streams do
during their annual floods and to pro-
vide the improved water-ways so widely
demanded government engineers say
great storage reservoirs must be built on
the headwaters of navigable streams and
their tributaries

  in doing this untold millions of
horse-power will be developed-enough
to take care of any conceivable increase
in the manufacturing and transportation
of the future

special traveling correspondent of the railroad mans magazine

over the sage-brush plains and fertile valleys of nevada mr willets
goes winding up in the rose-bordered slopes of that paradise of
america-southern california there he rests for a few days before
taking up his interesting journey

    the stories that he gathered for this instalment of his series contain
those elements of humor and pathos that make narrative breathe with truth
and human kindness dont you wish that you could have been with him
boys wouldnt you like to have heard the western trainmen and old
travelers spin these yarns well we just guess- yes 

no -on the latest desert railroad

romances and tragedies gathered in a trip over ex-senator clarks
salt lake railroad from the utah capital to the
silver sands of the pacific ocean

ing will grow out here because of the
terrible heat

  i carried both those gents out of here
some weeks ago and they declared that
after months of experimenting not a
darned thing would grow in this strip of
desert except just scrub mesquit

   but look at those shacks you can
fairly see em grow  tell you theres
an epidemic of fever hereabouts thats
going to make something besides shacks
grow in a night theyll tell you theres
never been a strike on this salt lake
route since senator clark opened the
show but i hereby inform you that the
biggest strike in the history of railroad-
ing is on right in this vicinity right now
and im one of the strikers

no reader that brakeman was not
crazy i had known him a whole hour
series bcean in march r a i i r o a d mans magazine single copies  cents

r

mas change for rhyolite
coldfield and tonopah  
having given voice to
this rear-brakeman an-
drews finished his flight
through the observation-
car went out on the rear platform
yanked up the protection-door over the
steps and jumped to the sands of the
nevada desert

  i followed him

   humph  he grunted in a tone that
bespoke actual delight in the indignation
that was animating his breast  look
at those shacks composing the burg of
las vegas every time i come through
here there seems to be two shacks where
only one stood before and yet gordon
true and roland peterson of the ne-
vada experimental station say that noth-
riding the rail from coast to coast



s 

and had found him to be perfectly sane
were it not that i had talked with him
ever since eight oclock i might have
believed him a little  off  when he made
those remarks while the los angeles
limited paused at the las vegas station

glad the boys  struck

  i pulled out of salt lake  that train
a little after ten the evening before two
hours late during the night we had
made up lost time and at five in the
morning at calientc had picked up
brakeman andrews and i think an en-
tire new crew and now here we were

the line from utah while caliente is
still the center of strike operations more
and more railroad men are joining the
strikers down the line all the way here
to las vegas

   the first man to strike was one of
our conductors rob rives the second
man to strike was another of our conduc-
tors dan swayze then in quick suc-
cession a lot more of us struck and me
among em

there was an american eagle measuring six feet from east to west of its wings

at las vegas on time at nine-twenty in
the morning

  it is  difficult thing for the san
pedro los angeles and salt lake rail-
road to make up time for it runs mostly
on the dead level passengers bound for
goldlield said good-by and at nine forty-
five after a stop of twenty-five minutes
our limited pulled away from the shack-
growing desert town and we rolled on
over the rails toward california

  andrews plumped into a big com-
fortable chair next to mine in the  ob-
servation  and said

  yes siree biggest strike ever
known on the railroads of the world it
began at caliente in this state just over

   queerest thing about this strike is
that when senator clark president of the
road heard of it he said  bully for the
boys  and when the senators brother
j ross clark who runs this railroad
learned of the strike he cried  oi oi
its great  and when douglas white
our literary press man and all the others
at headquarters at los angeles were told
that we had struck they chorused  good
luck 

   bet you never before heard of rail-
road officials talking just like that when
they got wind of a strike among the
employees

   well ill let you in conductor
rives was taking a walk in the desert


the railroad mans magazine

up near caliente when suddenly-he
struck i mean he struck gold he and
his brother at once staked a claim to-
day they are working gold eagles and
double-eagles out of an ore-body six feet
wide and a hundred feet long

   then conductor swayze got busy up
in that region and they say lies got a
claim thatll run something like five hun-
dred dollars to the ton  the conductors
went right on railroadin while others
worked their claims for em but the
later boys to strike in the same way quit
their jobs and went to workin their
claims themselves these new shacks
growing here at las vegas belong to
various strikers whove quit railroading

   now as i say im one of the strikers
myself-got a fine little claim of my own
staked out up by caliente theres some
forty of us strikers now who are spread-
ing that epidemic i spoke about-an
epidemic of gold-fever

   were all going to be john mackays
and other kinds of millionaires pretty
soon and what i say is that for once
in the world the most remarkable strike
in the history of railroading is now on
on this railroad and what i add is
that its the right kind of strike

  andrews sat gazing at his gold-bearing
bonds that lay hidden in the sands of the
desert and then continued

   i aint dreamin all im tellin you
we had a sign from heaven only last
week that shows us all were going to
win the strike good and big rnow
what the sign avas well it was an
eagle captured by two of our telegraph
operators up at crestline station on this
road almost plumb on the utah-nevada
line

caught a real eagle

   i know those two operators well
and i aint fooling you they are war-
ren stains and elbert gilbert they set
a trap for coyotes and in the morning
when they went to look at the trap
there caught fast was an american
eagle measuring six feet from east to
west of its wings

   they put that eagle in a big cage
outside the crestline station and when
we strikers hit crestline stains and gil-
bert came out and said

    boys you struck the gold and we
coined the first eagle

   thats why i call that a sign from
heaven were all of us going to have
eagles galore around here pretty soon
and were going to clip their wings just
so it cant be said of us that our riches
had wings

   that reminds me of george travers
a man who put in his railroadin days on
the southern pacific out of ogden and
toward sacramento and who at last
struck just like we are striking now and
struck it rich too he combined rail-
roadin with prospectin and when he
struck he chucked his job on the espee
and went down to ranab hard by the
corner where nevada and utah and ari-
zona meet

plain  mary darling

   george went to ranab because he
was sweet on a girl down there-the
adopted daughter of oscar powers
ranchman and in that sweetness of
george on that girl-her name was
mary darling-theres a story for you
thats got fiction beaten to a frazzle its
a regular shakespearian tragedy i tell
you with self-sacrifice and all that sort
of thing

   george travers ex-railroader was
riding the desert near ranab one day
when he came to a water-hole by which
lay a female in distress she was in dis-
tress because her horse had stepped into
a hole and had thrown her and fallen on
her with pretty much all of his weight

   travers promptly picked the female
up loaded her on his own horse then led
both horses in a bee-line toward the ranch
of oscar powers before loading the
girl on the horse i forgot to say travers
tried to revive her by throwing water on
her face but she persisted in remaining
unconscious

   on the way to the powers ranch
however the girl came to and travers
said  whats your address  

    im mary darling and you are
taking me to the right address replied
the girl

    that sounds like a book - name
mary darling says travers with a lit-
tle emphasis on the darling

 well it werent many weeks before
riding the rail from coast to coast



mary darling became to george tra-
vers just  mary darling you simply
couldnt keep him away from the powers
ranch and i allow  mary darling
was glad he just couldnt stay off the
place

    so travers at last suggested to oscar
powers that he marry  mary darling
and that the daughter cleave to him at
his own shack just beyond powerss
barbed wire

poor mary weeps

   acceptances and congratulations all
round and george travers rides off to
town to secure a license

   the next afternoon travers re-
turned instead of galloping up to the
corral with an  oi oi  and a  yi yi 
from his lusty lungs he rode up with all
the air of a rejected suitor and a dejected
man a family conference followed at
which travers told the news that had
fairly taken the heart out of him and
long before he could finish what he had
to say  mary darling hurried to her
own room to weep her heart out

   what was the matter just this
mary had indian blood in her veins and
never knew it till that day her grand-
mother was a piute oscar powers knew
of the blood but pever told mary

   he took her when she was a little
baby called her just mary instead of
using whatever her indian name might
be and finally  mary darling  and
thats how she came to have a name that
sounded to george travers like a book-
name

obliged in mexico

   well what do you think travers
did shoot himself like a lovesick
swain no not just at that time he
went to  mary darling and to powers
and said something like this 

    under the law of this state they
wont let a white marry an indian they
wont give me a license here but i
know where they will let folks of differ-
ent races hitch up together-and thats
mexico ill go to mexico and prepare
a home for  mary darling and then ill
come and get her and take her there and
well marry why look at her wliod

ever know shes a piute in face form
and manner shes a white if shes good
enough to be your adopted daughter
powers shes good enough to be my
wife im off to mexico

  and southward rode george travers
he hadnt been gone a day however
when a terrible thing happened mary
was missing powers and his ranch-
hands searched the desert roundabout till
they came to that water-hole where
 mary darling and george travers
first met that time mary lay there in
distress

   there they found mary no longer
in distress-she would never know dis-
tress again around her throat knotted
so tight that they had a hard time un-
doing it was a red silk bandanna which
george had given her pinned to her
waist was a note in which she asked
george to forgive her and saying that
she would not let him sacrifice himself
for her adding that if she married him
all his friends for the rest of his life
would point to him and say  squaw man

thinks he slept too much

   and that note was all of  mary
darling that george found when he re-
turned from mexico to claim her as his
bride

  ancl what became of travers i
asked andrews for he had come to a
dead stop

   they found him weeks later an-
swered andrews with a nervous laugh
 lying at that same water hole with a
bullet-hole in the center of his forehead

  brakeman andrews now reverted to
his pet subject the  strike and while
he was still discoursing on the achieve-
ments of his fellow  strikers we were
joined by the queerest and most interest-
ing man on that particular limited

  pie was mr darius darius mormon
aged seventy-two bound from salt lake
to los angeles on a pleasure trip he
was tall and leaner than any famine
victim he had the baldest head i have
ever seen on a human being his ears
stood out from his head like the handles
on a vase

  he helped build the central pacific
westward from the salt lake end of the
line knew c p huntington and leland


the railroad mans magazine

he was mr darius darius mormon aged seventy-two

stanford and artemus ward witnessed
the driving of the last spike in the com-
pletion of the union pacific at promon-
tory utah where that line joined the
central pacific and was present at a
similar celebration a few years ago when
senator clarks new salt lake railroad
was completed across the desert

  i had met darius darius the evening
before at the salt lake station when
for two hours be regaled me with early-
dav and latter-day stories of the railroads
of utah and even got off his little joke
on the latter-day saints

   going to bed he asked just as i
was about to make for my berth  see
here young man we sleep too much
im seventy-two years old and ive
passed twenty-four years of my life either
in my bed at home or lying asleep on
the ground in a railroad construction

 camp come outside and
 smoke

   he hopped off the car
 with the sprightliness of
 forty-two we lighted up

    im one of the utahns
  he said he never referred
  to himself as a mormon but
  always as a utahn  i
  knew artemus ward arte-
  mus came to salt lake to
  deliver a lecture he issued
  tickets to that lecture that
  he thought read like a joke
  ive got one of those yellow
  bits of paper at home now
  it reads  admit bearer and
  one wife how old are
  you thirty-nine well
  youve been asleep thirteen
  years of your life its too
  much

    why do you know he
 added  i was a passenger
 on a train over this salt
 lake railroad last june
   to provo lttah we
 had thirteen hundred pas-
 sengers aboard average age
 seventy-three and a total
 representation of over nin-ety
 thousand years of life and
 by george those passengers
 had been asleep thirty thou-
 sand years think of the
 wasted energy

 i asked darius darius how it hap-
pened that a train carried so many old
people

first old folks day

  it was a free excursion given to the
old folks of salt lake-the pioneer
utahns-to provo senator clark and
his brother ross clark ordered a train
of twenty coaches and two engines to be
placed at our disposal free of charge

   then the old people were invited to
be at the station at  am as the
train was to leave at eight as the re-
sult of the efforts of a committee of rail-
road men of this line the oldsters arrived
decked out in a fashion by which you
could spot a mans age the moment you
laid eyes on him

 all persons between the age of sev-
riding the rail from coast to coast



enty and eighty wore a red rosette be-
tween eighty and ninety a blue rosette
between ninety and one hundred a white
rosette over one hundred a golden
star and if you were under seventy
no money could get you on board that
train as i was only forty-eight years
old i refused to wear any rosette

   i dont understand forty-eight i
said

   look here he answered  didnt
i tell you ive been asleep twenty-four
years very well then i have been
awake only forty-eight years and you
can put that down as my real age but
seriously old folks day is an institu-
tion in utah  and as it originated in the
brain and heart of a railroad man thirty-
three years ago  want you to tell your
railroad audience about it

  a railroad man named john young
general manager of the utah western
railroad started this old folks excur-
sion schemeback in may  the
utah western ran only from salt lake
city to the shores of great salt lake 

but all the same john young thought
his road a wonder

   he wanted the pioneer utahns to
see what a railroad was like he insist-
ed upon giving them a free ride to the
lake where he could entertain them all
day as the guests of his road so he
invented the colored rosette and golden-
star idea and got a train-load of two
hundred and fifty passengers all over
seventy

the golden-star boy

   i was on hand to see that first old
folks train pull out it consisted of a
baggage-car seven open box cars and
three flat cars the only passenger wear-
ing the golden star was pop merrill
aged one hundred and one who lived to
dandle the fifth generation from him on
his knee and whose posterity numbered
seven hundred human beings

   from that spring to this one rail-
road or another out of salt lake has
furnished a train to carry the old pio-

 the only passenger wearing the golden star was pop merrill aged

one hundred and one


the railroad mans magazine

neers to some place near by for a free
days outing the excursion on the salt
lake route this year was the thirty-third
jaunt of the kind and was the biggest
of all

   when  was about thirty years old-
having passed about ten years of that
time in sleep- worked as a railroad
construction man on the central pacific
under huntington and stanford i told
the old utahns how we had a couple of
rascals running a store in a rag-town
near our camp and how those storekeep-
ers made money swapping cattle with
emigrants

kenyons cattle

   i told em how those two men would
swap one pair of fresh cattle lor three
pair of worn-out cattle then fatten up
the worn-out cattle and sell them to the
railroad-construction outfit at a big profit
but one day an emigrant got the best of
one of the storekeepers

   the senior storekeepers name was
kenyon in the absence of his partner
one day kenyon was approached by a
tired emigrant who said he had two old
steers down the road that were all in
but that they could be fattened up and
that he would sell them for ten dollars
then the emigrant pointed down the
desert to where the worn-out steers could
be seen standing in the road

   kenyon cinched the bargain by im-
mediately handing the emigrant a twen-
ty-dollar gold piece and receiving a ten-
dollar piece in change he said that he
would ride down and get his property
the next morning

   next morning when kenyon went
after the steers he found that two dried-
up carcases had been propped up in the
road to look at a distance like the real
thing was kenyon mad no he
declared that emigrant to be a mighty
smart man but he swore hed get his
ten dollars back and so he rode west
like the wind till he finally overtook the
emigrant and demanded the return of his
money

   the emigrant handed over a twenty-
dollar piece kenyon gave him ten dol-
lars change a clay or two later kenyon
rode into our camp at the grading and
told the storv

     and to think he cried with terri-
ble oaths that i rock all that distance
after that confounded emigrant just to
give him ten dollars more 

  hows that we asked

    why both the supposed gold pieces
which that emigrant gave me were coun-
terfeit

   that brakeman tells me continued
darius getting on another lead  hes
been giving you that story of travers
anti the indian girl well this country
is full of romances and tragedies of that
kind these rails over which we are
rolling is the old mormon trail to cali-
fornia ive traveled this trail when
railroads werent thought of as ever
being possible through this long stretch
of desert

   in those days there was a sheriff
known all over this country as  desert
tan so named from the quantity of
whisky of that name which he imbibed
one day  desert tan  captured a horse-
thief and with some deputies end other
desert rovers proceeded to string up the
thief i dont remember the name of the
horse-thief but i do remember that he
had a wife named kate

   kate was a fine woman to look at
but she had the wild ungovernable dis-
position of the true desert woman she
loved her thief of a husband and when
he was dragged away to be hung kate
followed close at the heels of the hanging
party

her life for love

   when they came to a cluster of trees
where the ceremonies were to take place
it was night and a dead hush settled on
the crowd suddenly out of that silence
came the soft pleading voice of kate
begging  desert tan  to spare her hus-
band  desert tan  merely shoved her
aside with words that no christian gen-
tleman would address to a lady the
result was that next moment  desert
tan  lay breathing his last under the
trees shot through the heart by kate

     desert tans  pals forgot all about
the horse-thief and turned their atten-
tion to preparing kate for her own end
by lynch law kate said never a word as
they began fastening the loop around
her throat then suddenly she cried
riding the rail from coast to coast



  wait a minute boys ill help you
you see they had been having trouble
getting the rope into place because of
the two heavy braids of very black hair
that hung down kates back so with
the words she brought the braids around
her shoulders to the front out of the way
of the mens clumsy hands and added

    now i reckon you can work
quicker im all ready

   well sir that little act of kates
saved her life the men were so im-
pressed by her bravery pluck coolness
and lack of fear that they simply could
not go on

  take that rope off commanded
the one who had assumed leadership
 now tie her on her mustang

   and when katie was securely fas-
tened to the mustang they struck the
horse a smart clip on the flank and away
he sped with the bravest little woman on
the mormon trail

   and what of the husband-the
horse-thief   i asked

  that coward ob he had escaped
-flown while the men were in the very

ft s

act of putting the loop around the throat
of the woman who had risked her life
and done murder to save him she
joined him at a camp somewhere just
across the line in california somewhere
about the place on this railroad now
called leastalk told the people there
what a low-down cur he was and had
him driven out of camp

clarks golden spike

  during that twenty-five-minute stop
at las vegas nevada i talked to two
or three  strikers employees of the
salt lake route who had struck gold at
caliente and thereabouts though at the
time i did not know they were strikers
las vegas is as i have intimated the
junction at which passengers change cars
to take the new branch line built by
senator clark from the main line up to
coldfield and tonopah it is called the
las vegas and tonopah railroad it is
natural that the  strikers  should have
stories to tell of happenings on the
branch line

   this branch was opened october
 with a great celebration in which
a golden spike figured as usual said
one of the  strikers

   goldfield that day had one grand
holiday with suspension of work at the
mines and a closing of business gen-

two dried-up car-
 cases had been
 propped up to
 look like the
 real thing


the railroad mans magazine

erally senator nixon who was with
senator clark in the senate handled
the golden spike after the most approved
fashion-the spike itself being made
from gold taken out of senator nixons
own mine at gold field

   well let me inform you that there
was revelry by night participated in by
about all the railroad men of nevada
who could get a lay-off for the occasion
we just hit things up grand thostly at
the expense of owners and directors and
officials of the newly finished railroad

   during the blowout up comes  rec-
ord  brady an engineer out of gold-
field and conductor alley out of the
same place and chief dispatcher nel-
son of the same all being men of the
tonopah and goldfield railroad which
line had traffic all to itself into those
mining towns till senator clark built
this branch into the camps

    record  brady and conductor
alley and despatcher nelson spoke up
for a hero  their line that nobody had
heard of the hero was a switch-ten-
der near tonopah named petera binger
-and he was hero because he was awake
at the switch and then some more of a
hero because his heroics never got into
print nor were they ever- noticed by any-
body save  record  brady and alley and
nelson

  that switch-tender peter a binger
saved about two hundred lives and a heap
of property-all by being a man who
could let his head direct hishands at the
crucial moment

awake at the switch

   it-was this way ringer was on duty
at the switch it was near eleven at
night in december  the point of
duty for binger was at one of the high-
est places on the railways of nevada just
outside of tonopah its mountain rail-
roading at that point all right and when
vouve got a double-header passenger-
traiu swooping down the mountain and
a heavy freight coming up the mountain
and both  the same track youve got
to act mighty quick

  all of a sudden binger hears extra
 the freight coming up the mountain
calling for the switch at the same time
he sees the headlight of the first engine

of  the passenger which was coming
down the mountain on a -marathon

   it was up to binger fourteen being
the nearest to hand binger knows that he
must set her off out of the way of iixtra
 at his switch was a y and whats
binger do but throw the switch then
frantically signal  withhis lantern to
stop as  record  brady engineer on the
head engine of the passenger swoops by
binger and into the y

  and just as-  stops short on the
straight leg of the y the freight dashes
by

one touch of nature

  we pulled into daggett california
about three in the afternoon and were
held up there about half an hour from
there to san bernardino and a little be-
yond we would run over the tracks of the
santa fe consequently any passengers
booked to finish the trip to los angeles
or san francisco via the santa fe
changed trains at daggett

  i made the acquaintance of one of the
depot men who told me this story

    ive seen it stated in print that rail-
road conductors are as a rule just ma-
chines performing their duty without
ever showiijg that they possess the milk
of human kindness so far as any extra
attentions to passengers are concerned
especially when passengers are very poor

   let me call your notice to conductor
moore of the salt lake route only a
few weeks ago when his train pulled in
here his passengers in the pullmans told
me of extra attention which moore gave
to the poorest immigrant passenger-and
if that attention of moore to that poor
woman did not indicate human kindness
then theres nothing in life on the los
angeles limited of the salt lake rail-
road was a young mother and her baby

    they were in one of the tourist cars
soon after the train left salt lake city
the baby began to cry most piteously the
mother seeming very weak tried to com-
fort the baby as best she could all
night the baby cried and all the next
morning while the train was running
through nevada

   when conductor moore passed
through the train he spotted that mother
and babe and decided that here was trou-
riding the rail from coast to coast



the tramp spoke to the woman and she answered at once

ble of some sort that required human
kindness he spoke to the young wom-
an but she only shrugged her shoulders
not understanding what lie said moore
noticed that the woman gave the child a
tiny hard crust of bread that the child
gnawed the crust ravenously and that the
mother glued her eyes  that crust with
a look that could spring only from one
who was hungry

   moore went among the passengers
and requested all who could speak a for-
eign language to come and talk to the
woman one passenger spoke to her in
french another in german a third and
fourth in italian and spanish but to
none of these did the woman respond

the timely tramp

   at kelso california where the
train stopped moore happened to see a
tramp stealing a ride instead of jump-
ing  the tramp with both feet moore
scrutinized him closely then asked him
if he could speak any foreign language
the man said lie could speak russian

   moore hustled him into the tourist-
car and there led him to the woman and
the baby the tramp spoke to the wom-

    	r r 

an and she answered at once  shes a
russian jewess said the tramp inter-
preting the womans words almost as fast
as she uttered them

    she says she arrived in new york
a week ago with plenty of money to join
her husband in los angeles she bought
her railroad ticket but before the time
came for her to board the train some one
stole all her money and her trunk and
everything she possessed except her
ticket

    she says she determined to start for
california and risk starving she says
she has been without food except one
stale loaf of bread ever since she left
new york she says she is now so weak
that she is hardly able to utter a loud
word but that if only some one will give
food to her baby she wont mind dying

   hearing these words conductor
moore took off his cap and went among
the passengers in the pullman asking for
subscriptions for the poor woman in the
tourist car

   fifteen minutes later he came back
to the woman with twenty-two dollars
and put the money in her lap then he
took some of the money went to the
diner and bought hot milk and other


the railroad mans magazine

things-bought more food than any
starving person could possibly eat and
survive

   told by the tramp interpreter where
the money bad come from the woman
broke down completely overcome by the
kindness of strangers in a strange land
whose language she could not speak
when the train reached daggett there
was her husband who had come to meet
her

   the last thing moore saw and the
last thing the passengers saw as the
limited pulled out of daggett was the
poor woman pointing to the train ob-
viously telling her husband of kindness
that seemed little less than a miracle

    where were you trying to get when
i overhauled you asked conductor
moore of the tramp while the train wait-
ed at daggett

    los angeles was the reply

    well said moore  thats one hun-
dred and fifty-eight miles but hanged if

i	dont let you ride plumb to the pacific
ocean at san pedro what kind of a
sandwich shall i bring you from the
lunch-room  

  san berdoo is the railroad mans
short-language-line for san bernardino
this is one of the busiest railroad towns
in southern california i had been there
on a previous trip so when my train hit
the place some of the men at the station
came to me saying

  back again what not stopping
over going right on to los angeles
sorry you remember the district at-
torney here - dickson well weve
nabbed him we trainmen have
arrested him whats he done

   arrested nothin weve corralled
him and hes in the all-firedest fix you

ever heard of you see when he got
tired of being a good railroader he be-
came a good lawyer and secured the job
of district attorney here the brother-
hood of railroad trainmen elected him
to be our head counsel now hes draw-
ing two salaries holding down two jobs
and as a result hes in an awful fix hes
got to resign one or the other of his
jobs

   why well our brotherhood held
a convention at columbus ohio not
long ago and there passed a by-law ma-
king it imperative that our head counsel
live at peoria illinois if he wishes to
hold down bis job with us

   and theres dicksons fix he loves
this california climate-same as all folks
who come here from the east and he
hates the chill of the north the citi-
zens here dont want him to go because
if be does they will lose the best
district attorney theyve ever had and
our brotherhood doesnt want him to stay
here because if he does well lose the
best head counsel weve ever had-and
there you are dickson cant make up his
mind what to do

  just then another trainman joined
those to whom i was talking  youre
telling our friend from new york about
that dickson mix-up said the new-
comer  but you arent telling him the
latest the brotherhood has offered
dickson a higher salary than hes getting
as the peoples representative here-and
pleasanter work too i reckon san ber-
doo wont look quite so good to him now
as peoria illinois does you see our
brotherhood comes to the pacific not
the atlantic coast for an honest lawyer
and when we find him we bind him to us
with bands of gold all-aa-board

and the men who made them
horrigans medal

by robert fulkerson hoffman

     a hero of the throttle wins the plaudits of
     a grateful public-but knowing ones revolt



h hes not so bad some-
times contended a fireman
whose feet were dangling
from the idle baggage
truck on the pelaya station
platform   can carry as
thin a fire with horrigan up as with
any engineer on the division

    hes a big wind and no cyclone-
cellar handy declared jim allen
 and i hope he dont pull me if im
drawn for one of the specials he keeps
me feeling that things are going to hap-
pen soon

   allen spoke with thefixed belief and
 deep unction of an experienced conduc-
 tor measuring up a comparatively new
 engineer

    horrigan has too many things on
his mind and he cant seem to keep
them there hes always slopping over
into talk alien continued

    if you were to ask him for a chew
of tobacco in the dark at a water-tank
on short time hed very likely give it if
he had it on him but before you could
get him to pull out for the next siding
hed start a lecture on what tobacco does
to the solar plexus

    and if you were to turn hot under
the collar and throw out your cud on
the strength of that talk while youre
trying to get him started hed turn in
at the next stop and give you facts and
figures world without end  what to-
bacco is costing the united states and
what per cent of its wasted through
rough handling

    horrigan knows too much besides
running an engine when i break away
 from him i always feel as if id been
grabbed by the neck and dipped in a
creek

  red jones the brakeman broke in
 he scares me way up into the rocks
when he gets talking in full release

   but he knows engine - dont ever
doubt it-and if he pulls us on special
well go where the rest of them go you
can bet on it 

  the engineer whom they had been dis-
cussing finished his walk across the
tracks after leaving the group of talkers
and was humming a happy nervous sort
of nothing in the way of a tune as he
stooped and touched here and there
about his engine which was waiting at
the coal chutes just over the way

  horrigan did not rightly belong on the
pelaya division this was not so much
because he had not been brought up
there although that fact operated as a
handicap against him just at first as
it does against any man coming new to
the special requirements of the mountain
service

  he had been taken  probation in
short as all men are taken there and
while he had succeeded in weathering
the test to the point where he had rights
 extra passenger runs yet he somehow
did not seem to belong

  he was a free and somewhat able
talker and seemed to have more than
the ordinary predilection for what is
commonly called a play to the grand-
stand even that might have passed
the broad tolerance of the men of the
division had he not possessed the un-
happy faculty of injecting into his ever-
reacly speech a vitriolic tang that sent
the comfort of common speed glimmer-
ing from any conversation in which he
engaged and left his hearers with an
unreasonable sense of shame for which
however they never could quite account


the railroad mans magazine

across the continent and when the re-
turn journey began pelaya division like
the rest of the line went into careful
and complete preparations for handling
the several heavily laden sections of the
special traffic which was scheduled to
run as number 

horrigan was drawn from the freight-
crews and assigned to the engine of third
number  among the others abotit the
roundhouse when the great day for the
division arrived there was a pregnant
silence born of a deep sense of the re-
sponsibility of handling the living six
sections that were laboring on from the
coast

horrigan alone seemed to find it an
occasion for much speaking and stimu-
lated to greater effort than usual by the
sense of his own responsibility he
descanted loud and long on how the
thing should be done to redound with
proper glory to the division

the others listened and one by one
slipped quietly away

duly number  trailed down off the
mountain-side and came safely to rest
in pelaya the happy zealous occu-
pants of its ten coaches swarmed out
and cheered to the echo the crew that
had brought them safely thus far upon
their return

  they cheered as heartily the engine
and crew that backed down upon the
train to take up the journey afresh and
number  went strongly and gaily upon
its way

  when second number  arrived all

they swarmed around horrigans engine
just before the start and cheered
and cheered again

  it was to them as though they had
been detected in the absurdity of trying
to fit a hex-headed bolt into a square
counter-sink and perhaps that was really
the trouble horrigan had too many
angles he did not fit there

  that was the way matters stood when
the society for the promotion of peace
on earth sent some thousands of its
members on a well-timed pilgrimage
horrigans medal



this was done again and pelava was tak-
ing on a quiet exultation at the unwonted
celebrity while horrigan with his
preparations made was circulating free-
ly with the throng shaking hands with
the pilgrims telling them in awe-inspir-
ing periods how the thing was being
done and what he too was about to do

  the rest of pelava of course was
equally glad but it was very quiet about
its gladness pelava well knew that
while there are trains there are chances

  second number  was well away when
third number  came in and disgorged
its burden of enthusiasts they swarmed
around horrigans engine just before
the start and cheered and cheered again
yielding at last only to the polite but
urgent insistence of the conductor and
trainmen who were trying with little
success to gather them all quickly back
into the train horrigans too effusive
greetings and responses from the cab-
window were holding them

  finally they reached the climax of
their enthusiasm and as the tide set back
toward the coaches their long-sustained
excitement their gratitude for safety
through many perils but dimly under-
stood and their longing for definite ex-
pression centered upon the well-meaning
but too demonstrative horrigan at the
cab-window the great volume of
voices trailed off from its cheering into
the dear old hymn of benediction  god
be with you till we meet again

  with that appealing strain  deaths
threatening wave  wafting to his ears
from the train horrigan pulled out with
third number s ten coaches and with a
suspicion of more than usual moisture
in his eyes horrigan was very far from
being a hard man fie was a hard talker
that was all

  horrigans present triumph was brief
complete and to him most satisfying
while it lasted he wheeled them away
magnificently over the first rise that puts
up its resistance beyond pelava and be-
gan dropping down the long reaches of
the eleven-mile hill with all of the as-
surance that careful preparation could
give

  his heart was beating high with the
warmth of the enthusiasm of which he
had unexpectedly become the central
object at pelaya and he saw himself

  thenceforth a towering figure in the
division annals

  the run ahead held no special diffi-
culties and he let the train soar down in
wide breathless sweeps that brought joy
to the hearts of the travelers and keyed
him to a keener gladness in his work

  with the throttle closed and the re-
verse lever latched well down ahead for
drifting he was sailing them free as an
eagles flight where he dared fondling
the brake-valve handle and holding
them safely where be must

  back in the crowded coaches further
campaigns of  peace on earth good-
will to men were being planned song
relieved the weariness of the long jour-
ney

  then without warning and from no
fault of his disaster fell upon horrigan
and rudely disturbed the confidence of
his passengers in their engineer deep
down in a vital spot of horrigans
engine a little detailed fracture had been
growing for many months where no out-
ward search could detect it and no fore-
sight or care defeat its growth

   close in behind the cellar of the main
pin securely hidden within its fit in
the wheel the little threadlike frac-
ture had been gnawing into the circum-
ference of the pin

   little by little it had eaten toward
the heart of the pin until now with the
rods fanning the air in a steely blur of
light and the wheels humming in dull
monotone in the rushing air the pin was
quivering upon its remaining solid core

  half way down the eleven-mile
grade just when horrigan had yielded
to the temptation of one proud back-
ward look at the inner side of the hying
curve of the train the overtaxed pin
let go

  there was only an instants crashing
jumble of sounds from below before the
roads wrenched themselves apart and
the swift stripping of his side of the
engine began

  in the next moment the forward work-
ing parts broke free with the shattered
cylinder and fell in the ditch the
side rod parted at the middle began its
work of thrashing with swift rotary
sweeps the cab and after fittings

  first among these to go were the brake
pipes and reservoir and when the seat-


the railroad mans magazine

  box went shivering upward in a shower
of splinters and tools horrigan stood
upon the deck where he had tumbled
without even a chance to touch the brake
valve or move it from the lap where lie-
had set it previously

  with the train-line torn open and the
air gone from equilibrium the brakes
went  with an emergency application
that set the coaches humping upon their
trucks and put in sudden motion a series
of wild gymnastics among the passengers

  before they were fairly untangled
from their catapult departures over the
tops of car-seats the train had ground
itself to an abrupt stop then they
shook themselves out of the tangle and
as hurriedly as conductor jim allen had
moved to the front at the first jolt they
were flocking to the engine ahead of him

  there he found them rapidly increas-
ing from a bevy to hundreds close
around the damaged engine standing
erect in the ruins of the cab the whole
side of which was torn off and gone was
horrigan with his hand clutching the
only projection that remained in reach-
the handle of the now useless brake-
valve

  horrigans cap was gone his blouse
was ripped up the back and there was
one bright spot of blood sending down a
trickle of crimson upon his cheek where
a splinter had grazed him

  he certainly looked the conventional
hero and as the little human eddy of
passengers swirled into a constantly wi-
dening pool of frightened humanity about
the engine a murmur of admiration rose
and grew until it broke forth into ring-
ing cheer after cheer punctuated with
cries of  speech  speech speech 

  none but a man built upon horrigans
lines would have thought for a single
moment of responding to this hysterical
demand under the circumstances per-
haps not even horrigan would have
done so had he not been frozen stiff with
fright and astonishment while the delight
of his ovation at pelaya was still surging
in his mind

  the latter apparently was the first
clear idea to free itself in his shocked
senses and with the entire trains com-
pany for audience-all save one lonely
figure that shot out from the rear of
the last coach and went running up the

  grade-horrigan clutched the useless
brake-valve handle spasmodically and
began upon a stammering speech

  jim allen conductor thrusting his
wiry body unceremoniously through the
closely packed crowd had reached the
distorted gangway between engine and
tender he had seized the hand-iron
and was thrusting his feet into the step
when horrigans first halting words
sounded

  allen stopped as though stricken pow-
erless with his foot in the air as the
monstrous folly of the thing made its
way to his quick senses but only for a
single look upward into horrigans dis-
torted and painfully working face

  then allens white face went even
whiter with suppressed wrath and he
sprang up the step and upon the littered
deck and stood tensely with the fireman
close behind horrigans shoulder

  he permitted horrigan to ramble
through a few sentences of rather point-
less platitudes and at the first tangible
halt in horrigans now rapid utterances
he stepped in front of him with a ghastly
smile seized his free right hand in a
crushing grip and shook it ostentatiously
for the benefit of the intent audience
below

  with his back turned to the passen-
gers and his eyes boring fiercely into
the eyes of the engineer he was saying
while his grip tightened

   horrigan you fool grand-stand
player you havent done a thing here
but roll in luck and you know it if
you dont cut this out and get down
and clean up the pins so fourth number

	can help us down the hill ill pound
you to a frazzle here on your own deck
get some tools and get down 

  then he released his fierce grip upon
horrigans hand turned with a strained
smile to the cheering audience below and
removing his cap bowed to them most
suavely while horrigan turned hastily
to the tool-box upon the tender

  a few moments later both of them
with the fireman were thrusting the
crowd back from below while the broken
rods were stripped off and the crippled
engine made ready for movement with
help from the coming fourth section

  in the few moments that this byplay
had occupied the only man of all the
horrigans medal



if you dont get down and clean up the pins so fourth
number  can help us ill pound you to a frazzle

trains people who
had not rushed to-
ward the engine-

red bill jones-
true to his great
trust had caught up
his flag with its dan-
gling sack of torpe-
does and was run-
ning swiftly to the
rear

  previously there
had been nothing to
distinguish him in
road talk from black
bill jones except the
qualifying adjectives
of color which the
road parlance had
supplied thereafter
however he was to
be known as the flag-
man who saved third
and fourth number
 his opportunity
had come suddenly
and he was equal to
its demand

  two train lengths
up the wide curving
grade the track was
lost from sight in
the deep and narrow
spire cut and be-
yond that the swell
of the mountain hid
it for a mile down
which its fourth
number  would
soon be bowling

red jones ran swiftly to the spire cut
fumbling the while with the string of
the torpedo bag meaning to make assu-
rance doubly sure by setting explosive
signals in the cut before running far-
ther in the concealing curve to meet the
oncoming section

  thus absorbed in his double duty a
vagrant wedge of rock caught his foot
and threw him heavily from the track
upon his shoulder into the ditch

  vith a muttered imprecation he
scrambled hastily to his feet and much
to bis astonishment fell over again quite
helplessly upon the spot from which he
had arisen

  a piercing stab of pain shot through

his ankle and when a second effort to
rise resulted in a second fall he exam-
ined the offending ankle to find it dislo-
cated and his foot badly awry

  he set his teeth grimly and tugged
at the anguished foot as at a boot it
would not right and he gave up the
effort quickly he crawled back up the
ballasted bank of the track and bent a
signal-cap upon the rail

  he crept an engine-length and bent
another cap upon the rail then he
began the long crawl upon hands and
knees up the grade in the cut with the
flag

  the ragged rock-ballast riddled his
clothing and bit cruelly into his naked


the railroad mans magazine

knees but he held to the middle of the
track with the flag wavering and upended
before him even though he left a dull
irregular trailing stain of blood upon
the ballast

  once he fainted for a moment with
the flag stretched out upon the rail be-
fore him and his face fallen among the
broken rock then he came back to the
pulsing anguish of his disjointed ankle
and crept forward again until he heard
the distant whistle of fourth number 
at the approach to the spire cut

  he stood up then leaning upon the
flagstaff for support until the black muz-
zle of the coming engine shot into sight
he raised the flag aloft waved it in wide
and steady sweeps across the track until
the deep note of the whistle barked brief-
ly twice in acknowledgment then he laid
the flag carefully upon the rail spread it
to its full length and rolled over into
the ditch as senseless as the ties bedded
in the track

  he was game to the last conscious beat
of his heart

  they lifted him to the cab and quickly-
brought him back to consciousness they
dropped cautiously down through the
spire cut and coupled in at the rear of
third number  and helped them down
the hill while red jones lay quietly upon
a plank that slanted forward from the
firemans box in the engine of fourth
number 

  the kindly members of the society
for the promotion of peace on earth
knew nothing of red jones or his doings
they were discussing in subdued tones
of gratitude and admiration horrigan
the brave engineer who had stood daunt -
lessly and alone in the wreck of his post
and saved them from a dreadful fate-
just what they were not so clear on and
horrigan was a brave man

  so with this single interruption the
splendid movement of the precious six
sections went smoothly on the day
saw pelaya division well and creditably
clear of its great responsibility and in
the days immediately following the re-
spective parts played by horrigan and
red jones in the spire cut affair be-
came a serious bone of contention

  the whole bitterly fought old ques-
tion of the comparative danger and
bravery of the several posts in train

service was reopened with a zest and
venom that it had not previously attained

  but the subject was wearing itself
out and bade fair to subside when a most
unfortunate event tore all lacerated feel-
ings open

  there was not a man in pelaya who
did not fully understand that when hor-
rigan was discovered clutching the brake-
valve handle he might as well have been
holding the empty casing of a burned-
out rocket so far as the safety of the
train had been concerned and that the
almost human action of the wonderful
brake mechanism had automatically
taken care of its priceless human freight
at the first crash without any possible
assistance from horrigan

  horrigan had indeed been a towering
figure in the discussion he had found
himself strictly on the defensive for
once and having made the best stand
he could against the none too gentle im-
peachment and innuendo which con-
stantly assailed him there had been
times when he was driven almost to the
point of unobtrusively leaving pelaya

  but the saving reaction had come at
length and pelaya was inclined to leave
him to extract whatever satisfaction he
might from the situation-and say no
more

  then came the misfortune horrigan
was sitting on a baggage-truck at the
station one day some six weeks after
the spire cut doings talking with re-
turning confidence to a group of road
men down the narrow stairway that
ascended to the superintendents office
just back of them a clerk came clatter-
ing into their midst

   see horrigan around here any-
where  he asked briskly oh he
added as the group opened a little far-
ther and brought horrigan into view
upon the truck

   say horrigan the old man has a
letter up there from those peace on earth
people asking him to give you this pack-
age and to read these resolutions to you
and give them to you too  in some suit-
able public place the letter says

   the old man says lies too busy and
im it ready he asked handing the
sealed package to horrigan and opening
a richly bound and engrossed document

  horrigan blankly accepted the pack-
horrigans medal



our brave and kindly fellow citizen jonas farwell horrigan did on the

eighth day of august-

age and for the rest of it never had an
opportunity to answer a shout of wild
derision went up and men slapped each
others backs while they demanded that
the clerk proceed with the reading hor-
rigan sat and said nothing

  with due identification dates and pre-
liminaries the document was opened
and the listeners granted the clerk the
courtesy of silence the reading pro-
ceeded 

    whereas-in the course of this our
  human life there are many deadly
  perils in which men should stand firmly
  one with another and

   whereas-the qualities of human
 courage and endurance are always to
 be desired and commended but more
 especially in the times of stress and
 danger where only the utmost courage
 will suffice and

    whereas-our brave and kindly fel-

  low citizen jonas farwell horrigan
  did  the eighth day of august in the
  year of our lord one thousand nine
  hundred and blank exhibit and em-
  ploy these admirable qualities in acts of
  conspicuous heroism and bravery to
  our lasting good and gratitude there-
  fore be it and it is
  resolved-that we a committee of
  the society for the promotion of peace
  on earth duly appointed and assembled
  do herein this dajr and date extend to
  jonas farwell horrigan the sincere
  thanks and the undying respect of this
  association and it is

  resolved-that a medal of gold ap-
propriately designed shall be provided
and presented to jonas farwell horri-
gan with a suitably engrossed copy of
these resolutions and it is
resolved-that a copy of these reso-
lutions be spread upon the minutes of
this association in further loving re-
membrance of jonas farwell horrigan


the railroad mans magazine

  the signatures followed in clue order
and when the voice of the clerk ceased
he handed the document to horrigan in
a dead silence that contrasted sharply
with the earlier burst of derision

  apparently nobody felt moved to
laughter who could laugh at such a
motive whatever its objective might be

  nobody laughed they who listened
had almost come to believe in horrigans
heroism against their own expert knowl-
edge of the event in question horrigan
had come almost tobelieve in it him-
self he had done what he could-he
was reasoning

  nothing prompted his inner con-
sciousness he was sitting pale-faced
and with downcast eyes looking at the
unopened package in his hand

   open it horrigan said some one
very quietly  lets see the medal

  he removed the firm wrappings and
sprung the little clasp exposing the
beautiful thing upon its cushion of
purple depending from its richly
chased cross-bar was a liberal circle of
the solid red gold of olden rome and
upon its polished face this inscription

to

jonas farwelj horrigan
from

the s p p e

for conspicuous heroism
august th -

gave ax order at the hotel desk against his
wages due

   the reverse side bore in bas-relief the
heroic figure of a man warding oft with
bared and upraised arm some unseen
danger while a girlish figure cowered
at his feet a trophy fit to commemorate
the best endeavor of any man when taken
with the earnest message of its presenta-
tion a worthy token indeed

  that until the time of his
going from pelaya was the one
occasion upon which horrigan
said nothing having fully
complied with the request of
those who stood about him he
folded his possessions away
and rising passed thoughtful-
ly up the street alone

  when he had gone one of
those who lingered a fireman
ventured the opinion that the
deal wasnt so far off anyhow
horrigan had stayed with the
engine he was there ready
to do what he could and a
man who had gone through
what he had at spire cut and
come out of it with as good as
a whole skin was entitled to
all he could get

  but it wouldnt do they
all knew the truth aud the
truth would not down red
bill jones was the only hero
of pelaya it wasnt right
and they liked right first and
glory afterward

   then it began all over again
somebody hooted from the ca-
 boose-track when horrigan
pulled out next day some-
body laughed when he signed
his report upon the work-book
at his return
horrigans medal



  the following morning found a savage
screed of doggerel verse posted upon the
freight-house in the unfolding of which
horrigan was made to suffer by compari-
son while red bill jones was lauded

  it crept into the conversation at the
hotel tables when horrigan could not
escape and was not directly addressed
he met it by implication at every street-
corner and even saw the reflex of it in
the faces of the children in the street

  he bore it sometimes in fiercely out-
spoken anger sometimes in sullen silence
until looking from his cab-window one
evening when just about to pull down
into the yards for the start on a night run
he found a four-foot placard staring at
him from the wooden face of the chutes

  evidently produced with much labor
and the aid of a marking-brush bor-
rowed from the freight-house this is
what he saw

the eagle eye stood on the deck

  the flagmans hair was red

that deck was busted good and hard

  the brake valve sure was dead

aw whats the use the boys all said

  the flagman was the stuff

but the people seen the eagle eye
  and never called his bluff

  nothing very serious this in the way
of an indictment and yet it struck so
close to horrigans own inner sense of
the situation that it was the one last
straw that he could not bear

  looking at his watch in white-faced
anger he found he had time to return
to the hotel across the tracks crossing
hastily he packed into an- irregular
bundle his few possessions gave an order
at the hotel desk against his wages due
paid his bill and making his way back
to the engine without encountering any-
body climbed aboard with his bundle

  in due time he departed on his run

  when he reached the farther end of
the division late that night he silently
folded the tent of his tenure upon the
pelaya division and as silently stole
away

  it is likely that pelaya in time might
have accustomed itself to the idea of the
medal even though it had never become
entirely reconciled but the engrossed
resolutions turned loose the muse of
every caboose poet  the line-and
every line has a large and prolific lot
of them although they will not all con-
fess

the growing record for safety

competition between railroads is a
good thing for the public and it is
especially good in the matter of safety the
burlington road has made a rccord of which
it has much reason to be proud because
during the fiscal year recently ended not a
single passenger was killed of the many mil-
lions who traveled on its trains

  this is a record which equals that made
by the pennsylvania railroad in the year
 says the new orleans stale and indi-
cates that the managers of the various rail-
way systems are giving considerable atten-
tion to the safety of the traveling public

  the interstate commerce commission in
its last report showed a substantial gain
for safety in travel for there had been a
great reduction in the number of accidents
of all classes and while this was admitted

to be due in part to diminished traffic on
the roads yet better discipline more care-
ful attention to the operation of trains and
the adoption of more safety devices were
undoubtedly factors that contributed to the
gratifying records made by the roads

  in the last year the activity in many in-
dustries has become almost as great as that
which marked the days preceding the panic
of  for business has been increasing so
rapidly that a car shortage is predicted

  therefore it is to the credit of the penn-
sylvania and burlington railroads that their
remarkable records for safety in the trans-
portation of millions of passengers were
made during a period of recovery from
panic stagnation and therefore cannot be
attributed solely to  lessened pressure and
diminished traffic

 -on the smoky end

payment of railroad clerks is too low but when the narrator of
these papers is president of the in and out he will
raise them  per cent

erhaps it sounds queer but
all railroads are more or less
alike the conditions which
exist on any one of them
are fairly characteristic of
all the same book of
standard rules is the basis of examina-
tions on all and if you qualify on the
rock island you could probably do the
trick on the new york central or the
mexican central

  thats been my experience ive
found out that the gaff on the arizona
in and out was a bit more of a grind
than the average road owing to the fact
that it was a mountain road and wher-
ever you go against the  hog-back 
track you will not be long in getting
pretty well acquainted with the broke-in-
two sign

  my promotion from the chief des-
patchers office came directly after carl
smith endeavored to break into the sting-
ers ranks and in doing so all but broke
his neck carl was just a common clerk
like myself with a capacity for long
hours and hard work but with a con-

stitution that would have been a dis-
credit to an adult ant

  one evening as we came out of the
office to make the usual trip to the
chinos i noticed that he was looking
more frail than usual and for a delicate
digestive organ there is nothing that will
do so much damage as three doses of
chinamans grub a day for a few months
and carl was certainly showing the ef-
fect

three trips for a pay-check

  as we came out of that office across
the track some fifty yards we noticed a
big boiler-maker carrying a large gen-
erous jag it was almost the largest
jag i ever viewed from the standpoint
of a disinterested spectator we stood
and watched him make a crooked
straight line for the master mechanics
office

  at the door he met one of the clerks
coming out and from the fussy conver-
sation which ensued it developed that
he had made three previous trips to the

began in the octobcr railroad mans magazine single copies  cents v


being a boomer brakeman



office that afternoon in quest of his pay-
check the boiler-maker was a mighty
good sort of a fellow but that jag he
was keeping company with covered him
from head to foot and looked as if it
might be the most ferocious specimen
ever captured in that neck of the tim-
ber at least it had a jim jeffries dis-
position  and before carl and i were
really wise to what was going on a row
had started

  the clerk would have qualified in the
featherweight class while the boiler-
maker would have tipped the scales at
all of two hundred pounds not count-
ing bis booze tonnage although the
little man gave away a lot of weight
he made a great run for the money and
im here to say that he would probably
have pulled in on the schedule had not
the crowd interfered

the arizona appetite

  it wasnt strict rules for the clerk
just kept beating ragtime on the boiler-
makers head with a brass fire-hose
nozzle till the cupola looked as if it had

been foul of a low bridge and when
peace was finally established there was
one head around there that looked like
a raw beefsteak and it didnt belong to
the clerk

  that fight got carl to thinking about
what he would have been able to do un-
der the same circumstances it took all
his strength to make a dent in a chinos
bill of fare and he shortly decided to
listen to the boys and try an outside job
for a few months and see if he couldnt
cultivate one of those arizona appetites
which makes it possible for a fellow to
eat scrap-iron without salt he went
and i took his place in the train-
masters office of the in and out

  i was interested in his experiment for
the stinger fever was on me and i was
anxious to see how a tenderfoot would
get along when against the real goods
carls first trip was his last one

  he caught up with murphy on the
first division local-the fellow who said
 a local run is a good place for a stu-
dent knows what he is without me tell-
ing him the very first trip carl made
after having carried a  dope  bucket

           the clerk just kept beating ragtime on the boiler-makers head


the railroad mans magazine

until his hand was blistered after hav-
ing jacked up cars until his back was
tied into a hard bow knot after having
rustled freight for eighteen hours he had
to take a high dive from the top of a
refer and land on his noodle and when
he came to he was in the hospital look-
ing into the face of one of those beau-
tiful nurse-girls

a rough-neck again

going into the terminal he was stand-
ing on the head-end of a refer when the

yardmaster had said that i could have
a place on frenchs crew and that same
evening before i had had time to draw
a switch-key and a badge frenchs crew
was called and got out without me
they went east on an orange special
behind bob kelley

  i learned in later years just how fast
bob could run thirty cars of oranges be-
hind a tandem compound engine  and
if he was living up to his reputation that
night he must have been traveling some
when the crash came

  a light extra - two engines coupled

train broke in two right ahead of that
car and off he went by actual meas-
urement he just lacked one and a half
inches of getting the big works

  as it was his right arm was broken
and the wheels missed his head by a
mighty small margin when i heard
all about it i suddenly became satisfied
to push a pencil for a few more months

  however shortly after that the am-
bition to be a rough-neck brakeman came
back again and  asked the boss to put
me on the extra board the day he said
he would i changed my mind again

  it was just like this ike roberts the

together without a train-was coming
west against him and bob had a string
of waits over half the division the
light engines were evidently trying to
make howard for the orange extra and
they would have been all to the good
and in the clear if some one hadnt gone
to sleep

  bob was in the clear all right as he
had the right of track and so long as
he stayed behind that string of waits
he could run them as fast as he wanted
i got the story from bobs own brother
who was firing on the head engine of the
light extra and who took to the tall

                         -vk a

he shot out into the country clearing everything but the barbed-wire fence
being a boomer brakeman



timber when he stuck his head out of
the cab and saw a headlight poking
around the curve

  bobs brother said that his crew on
the light engine had had about four
hours sleep in forty-two his engineer
was all in  and just as they passed the
high switch at howard the fireman
asked him where he was going for the
orange train he pulled out his watch
and didnt reply but eased her off a bit
and the fireman thought he was going to
run down to the west switch and back
into the clear

when three hogs meet

  he evidently went to sleep between
the switches and they met about two
hundred yards beyond the yard limit
board on a curve where the view was
obstructed by a deep cut in a sand-hill
something funny about these big hogs
they never turn out to go around so the
three big engines got all tangled up
smith the engineer on the first engine
of the light extra was sitting with his
feet in the cab-window when they hit
and he shot out into the country clear-
ing everything but the barbed-wire fence
along the right of way

  all he got to remember the accident
was a badly cut hand where it scraped
the window glass in the cab-window a
few jagged cuts from the wire fence
and his discharge papers the rest of
the crew on the light engine unloaded
as did bob and his fireman and no one
was killed

  i went out and watched them pick up
that wreck it was a great pile of splin-
tered box cars twisted iron and mer-
chandise mixed in it took four days
to clean up the mess although a slioo-
fly was built around it to open the main
line in less than ten hours after the acci-
dent happened when i walked over
from the wrecking-train and looked at
that heap of wreckage i decided again
that a clerks job had its advantages

getting stinger symptoms

  but this stinger fever keeps coming
back  a fellow with an awful regu-
larity and it was only a few months
after that accident that i began to note

the symptoms again nothing proved a
cure so i bolted the pencil pushing
drew a badge and key and one night
found myself called for the smoky end
of howard grimshaws crew a coal
drag for my first trip

  ever take the smoky end  a coal
drag ever eat the cinders from two
baldwin hogs when they were burning
gallup coal dont do it there are
easier ways-over the brooklyn bridge
or a leap into the grand canon for in-
stance

  but i didnt realize what i was going
against so i whistled my little whistle
proceeded to the coal-chute track to get
my engines and pilot them down to the
train calmly split the first switch i came
to as every student must and finally
had them coupled onto the string air
connected up and ready for the sign

  a great trip that twenty-eight cars
of coal the dirtiest coal that ever blew
into the eyes of a student brakeman
we were over  the mountain end of
the division where it is nothing but drag
and drag up and up until you finally
reach the top of the mountain range
and then its nothing but hold them
while you drop down  the other side

  so little to do going up that you get
tired and so much to do coming down
that you are half exhausted every-
thing went along fine until we reached
the divide and started down that sixteen
miles of canon road

the tallow-pot did it

  if i had known more about railroad-
ing i would probably have unloaded in
that old canon for the train ran away
got beyond control when we were eight
miles from the bottom of that grade
and although the boghead was squealing
for brakes and i noticed that we were
running pretty fast around the corners-
the curves are corners  that piece of
track-still i didnt have sense enough
to know we were in trouble

  finally they stopped the lead-en-
gine went onto the ties and plowed up
quite a stretch of track  the second en-
gine had every tire slipped and when
the crew came over ahead and began to
talk about the narrow escape i got real
frightened


the railroad mans magazine

  but it was on the return trip that i
pulled off the real patent - applied - for
stunt braking on the smoky end is no
soft snap and after you have been out
over twenty hours and are unused to
the grind its only natural that you long
for a little shut-eye in the hay

  i remember we had a positive meet
order with a train at bubbard and go-
ing into that station - it was nothing
more than a blind siding-i made my
way over to the head engine so that i
should be  johnny at the rat-hole 
when we neared the switch

  i climbed down and took up my posi-
tion in the gangway it was night and
i was sleepy the next thing i knew
i was experiencing a falling sensation
which ended in a dull sickening thud
and a fierce pain in my left shoulder
from where i lay on the ground i
looked up expecting to see fire and
steam descending on me and box cars
coming my way in droves  but instead
there was the engineer sitting calmly in
the cab with his head against the win-
dow-casing sound asleep

  i picked myself up hunted around in
the dark until i found my lantern and
anxious to be sure that no one saw me
fall out of the gangway on my head
and shoulder started to climb back
then i realized that i was hurt for i
had no use of my left arm

  i have thought about that little high-
dive feature several times since then
and the only thing i can make out of
it is that i went to sleep standing there
in the gangway while the train was run-
ning i never opened that switch but
it must have been opened for the train
was in on the siding i suppose the tal-
low-pot opened it for me

better be tied on

  then they pulled in on the siding
and after they had stopped and there
was little danger of me falling off i
just went and did it anyhow  always
thought it was mighty considerate of me
to wait until they stopped to fall off
for they didnt have to make a special
stop and lose time picking me up then
too ive thought it was considerate of
the train for had i fallen when it was
running at high speed there probably

wouldnt have been enough of me left
to pick up

  it was about four oclock in the
morning and as the engineer and fire-
man were taking a little shut-eye they
didnt see the acrobatic stunt and i
wasnt going to pipe it off to them but
when i dropped off to open the switch
at the terminal i couldnt deliver the
goods as my left arm was useless

  the engineer had to stop and the
fireman climbed down and unlocked her
and threw her over and then i had to
tell the truth and i got mine all right
all right after that john mckenna
would always suggest every time the
train stopped that i had better tie my-
self on

kind to a youngster

  i took a two-weeks lay-off with that
bad shoulder and in that time the brake-
man fever had a chance to recover all
that it had yielded to the heroic treat-
ment of rough experience but when i
was again ready to report for work i
had learned that there is some slight
danger in sleeping while on duty i
might add that the lesson cost me a
great deal less than it has cost other
people i have known

  aside from the fact that the smoky
end is always a hard school my break-
ing in was easy for me-the men made
it so i had always endeavored to play-
fair with every one when i was a clerk
 had no favorites and every time i got
a chance to do-a rough-neck a favor i
was glad to do it and i want to say
that those favors were the best invest-
ment i ever made

  when i got out on the road taking
the ups and downs with the rest of them
the little things  had done for the boys
kept coining back to me with interest
added until now i am firmly convinced
that railroad men are the most appre-
ciative in the world when the bunch
saw me out to make good firemen en-
gineers conductors and brakemen would
give me suggestions and often climb
down and help me do my work until i
had learned the ropes and could tell the
difference between a spot sign and a
wash-out signal

  i am firmly convinced that railroad
being a boomer brakeman



men as a rule never forget a favor an
opinion which is substantiated by a
thousand and one little incidents which
came to my notice while following the
game up and down the pikes in various
parts of the united states and mexico
i first began to notice it when engineer
walcott escaped the wreck on  the
section foreman who pre-
vented that accident went
down on rileys friendship
tablet in letters of gold

  after that da riley
never passed that section
but he whistled a welcome
and it was through the engi-
neer that the section foreman
was finally given a little trip
east-a months vacation on
full pay and transportation
over half the continent i
am reminded of a more per-
sonal case which illustrates
the point

  when i was still a train-
masters clerk one morning
a fellow came drifting into
the office and asked for a
job braking he looked as
if he needed a job and he
talked as if he wanted one
and although the extra board
was full at that time i
stretched it a point and put
him on

  he had a stingeris card
and good service letters and
when  put him on the board

i didnt think of it as a
favor to him at all he was
called that very night for a
locjil turn - around and less
than twenty-four hours later
i helped the boys take him off of
thomass caboose and carry him into the
emergency ward of the local hospital

  in putting a couple of cars of coal
on the chutes at a little station up the
line he had fallen between the cars and
one foot was so badly smashed that am-
putation was necessary almost four
years later i-broke hungry and out
of a job-met him again in el paso
texas

  i was running awful light making
slow time with no provision in the
schedule for meal stops sam - well

   	r r

call him sam for short - had just
been before a texas court to let twelve
men decide what that leg was worth and
he had cashed the member for a little
over five thousand dollars i was stand-
ing in a cafe making eyes at the free
lunch when in walked sam his wooden
leg beating a lamentable tune and re-

minding me of that night when i last
saw him

  he knew me in a minute i was
standing there looking like a caboose
after a rear-end collision and feeling
worse i was all to the rip track he
saw me and flagged me asked me how
i was running and when i told him
that i wasnt pulling tonnage that my
hue-sheet was leaking that i hadnt been
able to meet myself at the meal table
for two weeks he gave me the spot sign
and we went over in a corner and sat
down

i was standing in a cafe making eyes at the
free lunch


the railroad mans magazine

  to make the story short sam re-
marked that he would like the oppor-
tunity to break even with me on that
little favor  once did him out on the
arizona in and out when i gave him
a job and with no further remarks
handed me five of the biggest five-dol-
lar bills i ever saw they looked like
circus posters that little favor i did
him had cost him a leg but he didnt
figure it that way

  after i got out on the road braking
a full-fledged stinger i never allowed
myself to forget the grind which the
railroad clerk is up against when he goes
down on the salary-list i ground away

there for about fourteen hours a day for
my monthly insult kept all kinds of
hours and about every month i would
decide that it was the call of the stock-
car or the empty refer for me and away

  the railroad clerk of to-day is the
hardest worked poorest paid man in the
employment of a great system and in
more offices than one there are sixty-
dollar clerks with six - thousand - dollar
responsibility ive long since decided
that when i am made general manager
of the in and out the first official move
 make will be to raise the pay of every
office-man on the system at least one
hundred per cent

   in the december issue mr herrs hero will tell why he decided to break out of
the game

inventing as an occupation

from time to time our mail brings a
woful tale from a disappointed inven-
tor who has devoted a number of years and
considerable money to the perfecting of
some device which the world has not duly
appreciated says machinery many inven-
tors spend years on the development of an
idea which to them appears to be of great
value often too they sacrifice the employ-
ment by which they earn their daily bread

  it is but natural that the inventor who has
thus devoted his time and perhaps all of his
savings to the development of a new idea
should be discouraged when he finds that
he can realize little or no returns from his
invention as a rule he thinks that he has
been unjustly treated by those to whom he
has submitted his idea and often regards
the manufacturer as an enemy because the
compensation offered is from his point of
view inadequate

  in many cases the inventor sees from one
view-point only he has not the advantage
of wide experience and knows little or noth-
ing of the costly organization necessary for
marketing goods

  inventing should seldom be considered as
an occupation to which a man can profitably
devote all his time except in cases where the
inventors genius is of an extraordinary
degree

  the inventors who succeed as a rule re-
tain employment in regular occupations
while they perfect their inventions during
spare time the inventions being incidents
in their regular occupations or by-products
as i were

  when an inventor works under such con-
ditions he is more likely to correctly esti-
mate the value of his inventions and not
be bitterly disappointed because his inventive
genius is not highly appreciated

  a man who has true inventive genius can-
not help being an inventor but he should
avoid living in expectation that one brilliant
idea will make his fortune and enable him
to live ever after free from all pecuniary
cares

  the hope of  striking it rich  is a com-
mon fault of many inventors if they must
invent iet them content themselves with
moderate returns for their ideas placing-
each in the best market possible but not
feeling disappointed if a large fortune is
not realized from an idea that to the in-
ventor seems very valuable

  advice is cheap and is generally disre-
garded by those who could best profit by it
but notwithstanding we cannot help sug-
gesting that inventors of ordinary ability
should retain their regular occupations while
developing their ideas they will be happier
and their chances for success will be greater
than if they give up profitable occupations
hoping to produce something which will
make a large fortune

  the trouble is that inventors as a class
are a somewhat irresponsible lot to whom
a steady job is distasteful steadiness of
character and genius are rarely found coiii-
bined in the same individual and doubtless
much that has been said here will be of
little value to the class most in need of
advice

               a queen comes to a house of gold

              synopsis of previous chapters

philip sand being informed that he has a year before tuberculosis will claim him
as a victim prepares to get the best out of the time being financially ruined he
raises ten thousand dollars on his life-insurance policy of fifty thousand from a money-
lender named merton scraggs who opens up on the comfortable promise that sand will
not be living that day a year he charters a yacht to go treasure-hunting sends the
yacht ahead and himself goes down on the regular liner for panama on board he meets
miss verina harding they arc wrecked

was the use of going to a sanatorium to
be cured when the cure effected the
patient might meet a speeding automo-
bile or be killed in the very train that
was taking him back to life and useful-
ness

  fate however was on the side of
lauriston this time fate was not going
to upset this particular prophecy of the
gloomy doctor philip was to be re-
served for his just deserts at the ap-
pointed time for the present fate
merely whirled the young man around
in the sea for a prolonged half minute
then brought him to the surface

  philip could swim the first thing
he became cognizant of was the cold air
blowing upon his wet face then his
opened eyes were attracted by a streak
of light which flashed up occasionally
between the waves dawn was breaking
in the east

  either the steamer had foundered ot-
her lights had gone out for around the
swimmer darkness was upon the face of
the waters he could see nothing but
he could hear a great deal-the roaring
of the sea breaking over rocks with a
broad snarling- a-a-a-ah   and once
he thought he heard a long gurgling cry

  at intervals he collided with floating
objects in the water one of these philip

the irony of fate

          ueer it is to think of a
man down under the
sea laughing yet that
is what philip sand
was doing as the great
waters closed in around
him and he felt himself being drawn
deeper and deeper in the booming dark-
ness he was smiling broadly at his
own thoughts

  the main thing that occurred to him
in an amusing way was the luck of mer-
ton scraggs at the very outset of af-
fairs the old skinflint was likely to reap
his one hundred and fifty per cent

  dr lauriston also flashed before
philips alert faculties another proph-
ecy gone wrong-at least the spirit of
it he wondered as he whirled about in
the breathless undertow how many doc-
tors prophecies went wrong in similar
fashion 

  it proved to philip that he was quite
right not to have taken lauristons ear-
nest advice that he go to a sanatorium
and  take the cure  in a reclining chair
for a year life had seemed such a
chancy thing to philip just then what
the railroad mans magazine

ized hoping to find a spar or a life-
buoy but it proved to be a man who
attempted to seize him

  philip wriggled free he was willing
to help but not to sacrifice his life use-
lessly

   lay one of your hands on my shoul-
der   he shouted above the storm

  there was  answer he swam for-
ward a few strokes to right and left
hoping to find the drowning man again
but apparently he had gone down

  once again philip thought he heard
a cry and a second later he heard voices
raised in loud talk

   they must be in a boat he reflect-
ed and next moment he hailed as loudly
as his almost exhausted lungs would let
him

  no response came although philip
still heard the voices they were pres-
ently lost and silence reigned upon the
ocean save for the snarling of the break-
ers and the melancholy dirge of the wind

  then a feeling of desperation seized
him he was alone on the sea it was
still too dark for him to see any dis-
tance around him he might be near
land or he might be twenty miles from
it twenty miles even the possibility
of five staggered his brain

  he struck out in the direction of the
dawn keeping the reef to his right
perhaps the island was behind the reef
it was his only chance he could have
swam to the reef easily enough but that
would be courting death

  all at once philip sand had forgotten
his deep - sea amusement and life was
the most precious thing in the world
his whole faculties were centered on that
one thing-life-and he meant to give it
up hard

  his arms were aching and his breath
was jerky and short it flashed into his
mind that he had a poor pair of lungs
for such a strenuous battle but still he
was not discouraged he would fight
for life to the last heart-flutter and
there in the roaring sea as he struggled
against terrific odds it seemed to him
that merton scraggs was whispering in
his ear

   life is sweet mr sand-even to
me

  slowly the light in the east spread
a little to the right ahead of the swim-

mer arose a low cloud was it a cloud
it might be land but it was as yet too
dim and shapeless for the eye to deter-
mine

  like a man clutching at a straw he
swam toward it wildly at first but
presently he steadied his stroke for there
might be a chance and he must conserve
his forces

  it seemed fully an hour before the
light convinced him that it was land
in reality it was about ten minutes be-
fore the cloud took the shape of a soft
round hill whose base was clustered with
trees and palms it was like some dim
oasis in a desert of water and across it
lay fine strata of mist

  by this time philip was in the last
stages of exhaustion he was seized
with an irresistible desire to cough he
did and swallowed a mouthful of salt
water that irritated his throat and lungs
still more

  he raised himself in the sea and trod
water until the paroxysm had passed
then he swam again a hard smile on
his face that was the fatal cough
below were the fatal waters yet he
would fight

   life is sweet mr sand-even to
me

  the shore came nearer presently the
tumbling sea became quieter and seemed
to breathe mightily but steadily if he
could only last five minutes longer he
would be safe

  but his arms refused to obey his will
his strokes became feebler shorter and
slower he felt his body sinking lower
in the water several times he lifted
himself in an effort to keep his nostrils
above the surface no longer were his
limbs moving in accord they were
feebly swaying independently of brain
control

  a mist began to gather before his eyes
he fought it off and struggled forward
again the mist and now a fog in his
throat then he was choking with his
lungs full of salt water he felt his
brain reel and his whole being sink into
red blankness

  the last thing he knew was being lift-
ed as it seemed on the wings of the
wind carried up to a great height and

flung down - down--down  then his

body struck against something again
treasure of the world



he was being lifted up and again he was
flung violently to earth

    ive been washed ashore he reflect-
ed semi consciously  ill be all right
if i dont die of exhaustion

   then he fell asleep

  philip next felt very uncomfortable
his nostrils were filled with the stench
of sun - baked seaweed his back was
very hot and his feet very cold also
there was a continuous rustling around
him and things ran across his face

  he opened his eyes and promptly shut
them again the sunlight hurt in a
little while he became used to the strong
light then he sat up stiffly and looked
around

   he was lying on a beach with the sea
lapping around his feet and sometimes
driving foam right up to his waist
about fifty yards up the white beach
there was a long fringe of coco-palms
ending in a pile of rocks to the east and
another pile to the west that was all
he could see of the land to which he had
been washed

   he looked out to the sea and then his
memory returned in full force the
revuelan had apparently gone down for
there was not a sign of her he looked
over the face of the ocean then his eyes
roved the length of the beach there
was a quantity of wreckage at the tide-
mark but not a sign of a human being

  was he the sole survivor it looked
so all at once philips heart and mind
were clouded by a great sorrow all at
once the ships company seemed to pa-
rade before his inner sight they were
all drowned - the complacent captain
rodgers the asthmatic planter who
would no longer worry over the tariff
the voluble  cattle prince and the
quiet englishman who found his ideas
 most interesting the pitiful higgs
was drowned too and poor little old
miss sharpe who would never again
utter her prim reproachful- vcrina 

  yes and verina was drowned too
it seemed impossible that that beautiful
creation of god should be as-should be
as dead as higgs it did not seem fair
somehow that they should suffer a com-
mon fate yet it seemed true enough
that drowning had been the common fate
of all but philip sand

   the ways of god are inscrutable

said philip to himself with a queer
laugh

  he was thinking of all that ships
company gone to death and he alone-
philip of the mortgaged life-the sur-
vivor

  by and by he arose and staggered
rather than walked to the fringe of
trees again he sat down this time with
his head and shoulders in the shade of
a coco-palm and his legs in the sun-
light that they might dry

  where was he anyway it was all
so new to him the sand of the beach
was unlike anything he had ever seen
there were brilliantly colored lizards
and queer-looking crabs running about

   the inshore waters were a beautiful
opal shade farther out the sea was
green then indigo-blue and close to the
shore it curled its lips and showed start-
lingly white teeth

   he looked up at the tree above him
its slender stem arose and curved out-
ward without a break or a branch until
the crest was reached there it burst
out in a great rosette in the heart of
which were clusters of big shiny green
globes

    coconuts thought philip

   the breeze rustled through the palms
and presently a big dried nut fell at his
feet with a startling thud he drew a
penknife from his pocket and tried to
cut the husk off but it was too hard

    perhaps i could get a green one
said philip to himself

   he got up and walked with difficulty
along the fringe of palms presently
he found as he had expected a green
nut which had yielded to the previous
nights stonn this nut he pared at one
end with his penknife presently the
nut gave a hiss and a little spurt of
fluid came from it the knife had
reached the soft half-formed inner shell
and pierced it

   he put the little hole to his lips and
drank the milk was sweet and fresh
and almost as if it had been carbonated
it-contained an amazing amount of fluid

   the first thing to do was to find out
if possible where he was he remem-
bered the captains chart of the day be-
fore and tried to trace the probable
course of the vessel the gale had been
from the northwest


the railroad mans magazine

   castle island light had not been sight-
ed on the port side probably the re-
vuelan had gone out of her course to the
southeast before the northwest blast in
that case castle island light might have
been lost to starboard

   if that surmise were correct then this
island was probably one of the inaguas
which had appeared to the southeast of
castle island it might even be one of
the turks islands if by chance the re-
vuelan had escaped grounding on one of
the greater islands

  philip remembered the soft rounded
hill in the center of the island as he had
seen it in that terrible dawn when every-
thing had been indelibly stamped on his
senses he entered the fringe of vege-
tation and struck inward and upward at
right angles from the beach

  in about half an hour he came out of
the belt of jungle and found himself
upon a gentle decline it was the hill
it was bare of vegetation save for a
hardy form of wiry grass rocks were
numerous and sometimes lie had to
clamber up a steep bluff but the hill
was low and in a short time he stood on
the summit and looked around him

  he could see the ocean  all sides
the first thing that attracted his atten-
tion was a brown sandy-looking island
about five miles to the east of the one he
was  presently he descried other is-
lands farther off in fact the entire
horizon was broken by the crooked out-
lines of barren sandy islets

  his own island differed from all the
others in that it had a belt of luxuriant
foliage all around it through this at
intervals he caught a glimpse of the
white beach and the breakers so far as
he could make out from the hilltop
there were no houses no sign of human
beings or human habitation

  his expedition had cheered him
that his island was not remote and was
one of a group not a hundred miles from
the regular track of west indian and
south american steamers was a consola-
tion

   it even was possible too that the re-
vuelans company was scattered over
these islands he remembered that
there had been at least one boat launched
before the steamer foundered for he
had heard the voices in the darkness

people struggling for life in the sea
would hardly have carried on a lengthy
conversation

   the next thing said philip ad-
dressing himself  is to find a shelter
for the night

  he descended the hill by the way that
he had come passing through the belt
of jungle he curiously examined many
strange trees there were many bril-
liantly colored but oddlv shaped fruits
none of which he cared to sample

  if he had only known that the big
green cannon-balls which he turned over
so curiously were breadfruit had he
known that the sticky turpentine smell-
ing oval apples which strewed the
ground were mangoes or that the yellow
cheesy - odored things were exquisite
cashews he might have worried less
about starvation

  as it was he decided to confine him-
self to coconuts of which there were
plenty

  philip in his meandering was sud-
denly startled by a grunt followed by
a tremendous scurrying in the under-
growth next moment a number of
small - sized black animals dashed past
him scattering in all directions

  pigs said philip tempted to
laugh  i wonder where they came
from

  it did not occur to him to reason the
presence of pigs  the island he was
only wondering whee so many of them
had suddenly appeared from he
pushed his way into the brush whence the
pigs had rushed and presently came to
a face of rock with a large hole in it

   looks like a cave said philip
 good there wont be any room for
the pigs to-night

  he walked into the cave for a min-
ute his eyes now grown used to the
light could see nothing in the dimness
but gradually he made out that it was
quite a comfortable place only it smelt
abominably of pigs it was perfectly
dry and-

  philip stumbled over an obstacle he
caught himself up and bent to examine
it with his hands it was square he
tried to move it he succeeded toler-
ably but it was as heavy as lead

   thats funny pigs dont have
trunks  he exclaimed
treasure of the world

  lie looked around the cave again his
eyes becoming more used to the dimness
made out other queer things about the
cave at the further end there was what
seemed to be a wall built of bricks
he went forward and examined the wall
then he stood perfectly still absolute
silence reigned

  presently he made a queer cackling
sound in his throat he turned on his
heel and walked out into the open he
staggered slightly then fell  the grass

  a moment later that part of the is-
land was ringing with shrieks of almost
insane laughter the circumstance-
the irony of the circumstance-was too
much for the son of philander sand

  philip sand who had hired a steam-
yacht to- hunt for treasure had been
wrecked on the caicos islands and
about the first thing he had stumbled
upon was the pirates cache

chapter vi

treasure and pork

ri h ere was something more than
mirth in philip sands laughter
there was a bitterness - a regret over
the absolute futility of human achieve-
ment his treasure - story too had
fallen to pieces or rather it had
reached an anticlimax anticipation
was gone and the realization had fallen
flat he had found the treasure at the
first move instead of after divers ad-
ventures and hairbreadth escapes as is
right and proper in a treasure-hunt

  but his sense of the ridiculous saved
the situation  and the situation was ex-
tremely ridiculous he was staggered
by its funny side pigs sleeping on sil-
ver plate and golden ingots reveling
perhaps among pearl necklaces and
other baubles of worldly worth  scratch-
ing their backs against golden images

   the husks that the swine did eat
quoth philip humorously and then he
rolled over and laughed again -

  he had only taken a cursory glance
at the store of wealth but he had dis-
covered enough treasure to suggest that
the boxes contained twice the visible
value

  true he could pay oft the mortgage
 his life but if lauristons predic-

tion had been right-and it did seem as
if philip were reserved for some partic-
ular fate he would lie a dead man in a
year and the spanish treasure would be
as useful to him as it was to-to gibbys
father or to the pigs

   i can scratch my back on it any-
way chuckled philip almost hysteri-
cally  gibbys father cant do that

  for about two hours he sat before the
mouth of the cave gradually recovering
his sober senses and marveling over the
business here he was on a desert is-
land-a beautiful little island-and ap-
parently it was all his

  he had enough to drink and the
problem of eatables would probably
solve itself  the morrow and he was
also sole owner by right of discovery
of a treasure which on its face was
worth at least a million dollars what
a funny thing life was

  as he thought it over-the coconuts
the queer fruits the pigs and the treas-
ure-it became clear to him that the is-
land had been a favorite resort of certain
persons at some time or other probably
it was the pirates who brought the fruit-
tree plants and the original pair of pigs
just as they had brought the treasure

  philip was wrong in this theory there
were no mangoes or breadfruit in the
west indies in the days of the pirates

  but even if he were rescued what
good would this treasure be to him if
he could not live a year at present he
had his yacht and sufficient funds to
keep him through the year to a man
who loved fast and high living the treas-
ure might be a handy asset but to philip
sand it meant nothing worse than th-
ing

  he might await the rescuing steamer
and present the treasure to the rescuer
or to charity but the commercial in-
stinct of the late philander sand arose in
arms at the thought and in philip
sand too although he did not admit it
to himself there was still a great deal of
red blood and human instinct

  it was the problem of the fifty thou-
sand dollars over again he hated to
leave an unearned fortune to an unde-
serving heir or to some one for whom
he had not the slightest affection it
was his treasure yet what was he to do
with it

for the latin-american steamship re-
vuelan which never arrived what
would pearce do with the yacht when it
was reported that the revuelan went
down pearce himself had caught the
treasure fever he had shown most de-
cided symptoms of it when he could not
keep his own counsel

  perhaps pearce would set sail for the
cocos islands not knowing that the
 differing information  which philip
had in his breast-pocket placed the treas-
ure in a diagonally opposite direction

  it amused philip sand in an ironic
way to think of pearce sailing off on
the long voyage through the strait of
magellan and northward to the cocos
when the treasure lay only a few hun-
dred miles from colon and mr philip
sand was at that moment sitting on
guard over that treasure shooing pigs
off it

  laughing inwardly philip drew the
damp log-book leaf from his pocket
ripped off the oilskin covering and dis-
covered that the sea-water had utterly
obliterated the legibility of the ancient
manners entry

   and i alone know said philip
suddenly solemn

  he pitched away the worthless paper
it had been all that remained of that
old captain and gibbys father and
gibby himself now they were dead-
and buried their identity had be ob-
literated by the sea and no man w  d
ever know that they had lived or know
that the treasure was on the caicos and
not on the cocos

  there came a grunting from the un-
derbrush

  get away you brute shouted
philip again there was a hasty flight
of pigs

  philip listened until the sound died
away then he cackled softly to himself

    the pigs want to sleep he reflected
with the inconsequentiality of exhaustion
  wonder did they ever realize what
they were sleeping on

  the suggestion of disturbed repose

made philip aware that he himself had
had a hard day that it was quite dark
and that he might as well rest he en-
tered the cave again it was utterly
black inside but the air despite its
farmyard odor was warm

   philip felt quite grateful to the pigs
even for the homelike atmosphere of
the place he managed to make a bed
out of two boxes and presently he
stretched himself out for repose

  he did not sleep much for several
hours the pigs had to be shooed away
every half-hour and in the intervals
philip composed himself by dreaming
this is one way of going to sleep-to
imagine grotesque dream things

  philip imagined that he would keep
the secret of the treasure before his
year was up he would make a regular
chart leaving out names and he would
make a document full of crosses mys-
terious marks and directions for pacing
etc so that some other adventure-loving
party would have more joy out of the
search for and discovery of that treas-
ure than he had had himself

   he finally grew tired of being dis-
turbed by the oncoming pigs just as he
was about to dream himself into uncon-
sciousness after one more frantic rout-
ing of the swine he settled down for the
night and fell asleep just at the point
where a man with knives stuck in his belt
was making a iine with his hand from
the shadow of the point of rocks at pre-
cisely  pm

   philip was awakened about sunrise by
stertorous snoring all around him he
sat up dazed opposite him was a wall
of bricks the lower part of which was
deeply scored and of a glittering yellow
then he remembered the treasure and
where he was

  but the snoring the light was dim
in the cave but he could make out long
black bodies stretched in -slumber all
about him the iair too breathed of an
overfilled lodging-house that has not been
aired for a month- or two

   he shot out his foot at one adjacent
lodger who was sonorously offending
the lodger gave a wild squeal next
moment the cave was filled with snort-
ing squealing and rushing two pigs
had got in after all and had slumbered
peacefully all night by his side
treasure of the world

  the incident amused the castaway
and so his day began with lighthearted-
ness  but it was only after the noise of
the retreating pigs had died into the dis-
tance that a very practical thought oc-
curred he suddenly felt the gnawing
hunger of a man who has slept soundly
upon an empty stomach

  all at once he realized what a fool he
had been to let the pigs get away so
easily he might have knocked one of
them over the head while it slept beside
him yet the thought had not occurred
while the pigs were still snoring for
there had been the feeling that after all
they were fellow lodgers and it would
have been unnatural for philip to think
of assassinating a bedfellow for the sake
of a loin chop

  but he had to eat his hunger was
of the kind that is not particular as lo
the viands so long as they are eatable
but it was powerful enough to demand
that the meal be solid and substantial

   now if the pigs would just come
back said philip to himself half un-
consciously picking up a golden ingot
 i believe  could hit one at close quar-
ters a pork chop would taste fine this
morning

  just my luck laughed philip
if i had been more sociable last night
one of the pigs might have sacrificed
himself on the altar of mans necessity
however-

  he drank the contents of two green
coconuts they filled him but did not
remove the aching sensation before
risking the queer fruits which he had
seen he sat down to think while he alle-
viated his pangs with the slimy meat
from the inside of the young coconut

  there was plenty of pork on the is-
land in time he might be able to kill
a pig  but even if he had one ready to
hand it would take him some time to
cut it up and cook a chop was there
nothing else that he could get quickly

  in imagination he glanced over a
menu-card olives yes olives might
be growing here only philip was not
quite sure that he could tell an olive-
tree if he saw one and he was not sure
that olives were the washed-out green
on the tree that they are in the bottle
clams-oysters yes there should be
shell-fish  but then they might be out of



season and philip had no very clear
idea as to where oysters were to be
found

   there was the ocean and it was full
of fish why not catch a fish fish
for breakfast

   it was a brilliant idea but it was like
pork chops for breakfast how was he
to catch a fish any more than kill an
elusive pig he had no line no hook
he might catch one in the shallows with
his hands but it was now an hour past
breakfast-time and he was very hungry

   surely  can find something to
make a hook and line he said to him-
self  among all this truck -and his
eyes turned to the boxes- there is
something that might be made use of

  he got a large stone and began to
batter the top of one of the boxes the
wood was quite rotten and in a moment
he had the lid off breaking the hinges
as if they had been soft putty

   inside the box he found a miscella-
neous collection of valuables there
were strings of coral and strings of
pearls many elaborate necklaces of vari-
colored stones and quantities of jeweled
brooches the bulk of the stuff in the
first box was made up of little golden
images-crude things with queer heads
and cross-legs

   they reminded philip of little indian
gods he had seen in the metropolitan
museum he decided that that was
what they were-indian gods probably
stolen by the spaniards from incas of
peru and brought across the isthmus
with the other ill-golten store only to
fall into the hands of the first high-sea
marauder

   but he gave little time to dreaming
just then his hunger was extremely
practical in its demands he was look-
ing for a hook and line with which to

	catch a fish for breakfast

  he picked up a brooch in which was
set an uncut ruby it had a stiff pin
and for a few minutes the hungry man
was busy with a stone beating the pin
into the semblance of a hook succeed-
ing in this he made a cut near the point
with his knife so as to give the hook a
clutch should it lodge in the mouth of a
fish then he turned in search of a line

  there was a lengthy string of red
coral which seemed strong enough to
g

the railroad mans magazine

this he tied a bit of fine gold link-ehain
and added to the length a kind of hair
rope which was decorated with strung
pearls

   that should make a fairly good
fishing-line said philip to himself
holding up the outfit for his own inspec-
tion

  next he prepared to attach the hook
he was going to break the brooch off
the bent pin when he suddenly remem-
bered the love of fish for a bit of color
he had never fished with a ruby before
but if he knew anything about fishing
a ruby set in gold should make a pretty
good troll as he could hardly troll in
the strict sense he could try a cast or
two and draw in his brilliant bait slowly

  a few minutes later he had climbed
to the point of the pile of barren rocks
he cast out his rich line as far as its
weight and length would take it and
then began slowly to draw it in

  the result was nil he tried again
and with the same result

    there arent any fish hereabouts he
said to liimself and then he laughed
for it was so like a fisherman at the end
of the first vain five minutes

  at the end of half an hour he was
growing quite disheartened also his
hunger was lowering his optimism

   ill try again said he as he drew
in the mocking jewel without a catch
 if there is any virtue in an old saying
i will catch a whale presently pickle the
meat use the blubber-oil for illumina-
tion make a bow to shoot pigs with out
of the whalebone convert the-

  he stopped he had thrown the line
and as he started to draw it in he felt a
slight jerk followed by the thick wavy
motion that thrills the soul of the angler

  hear me ye gods cried philip
jubilantly  i have caught a fish 

       chapter vii
       the house of gold

ten minutes later philip sand sat in
front of his cave a fine whole-
some-looking fish lay on the grass before
him but the angler was scratching his
head

    ive caught a fish said he as if to
assure himself that that difficulty at least

was solved  but how the dickens am i

to cook it

  by this time he was in a desperate
condition from hunger

  philip was doing very well asan ama-
teur robinson crusoe but the trouble
was that most of his knowledge of pro-
cedure on a desert island was based on
defoe and marryat for five minutes
he had tried in vain to produce fire by
rubbing two sticks together for ten
minutes he had exercised his penknife
with a piece of stone that looked like
flint and very likely was not then he
cast his mind back to stories of ship-
wrecked mariners

  there was one story in which he re-
called that the castaway made a fire by
gathering some dry leaves together and
setting fire to them with the aid of the
sun and the small end of the telescope
philip hadnt a telescope he hadnt
even a pair of eye-glasses he had a
box of matches in his pocket but the
water had touched them and the heads
had come off

  tust at that moment he would willing-
ly have parted with that million-dollar
treasure for just one dry match with
which to make a fire to cook that fish
he would not have considered the price
a bit too dear even without a guarantee
that the match wouldnt go out

  he got to thinking of a certain fable
in which a traveler was dying on the
desert and all he had was a bag of
pearls the fable told of the mans aw-
ful sufferings and of his feelings how
he had gone down on his knees  the
desert and promised the saints that he
would build temples with his precious
pearls if only a miracle could be
wrought and he could have a teaspoonful
of water and a crust of bread but the
miracle wasnt wrought and the traveler
died in fearful agony

  it was a fine story philip thought-
a fine parallel only the story was a
lie it had always worried philip that
story because if the man died how did
the truthful scribe know about that
prayer and the travelers soulful emo-
tions 

  anyhow what had that to do with this
fish philip could not quite recall just
what had started him  that story oh
ves- ii was the uselessness of treasure
treasure of the world



as compared with a little match but
was that fabulously valuable man-sought
stuff so useless wasnt there a spark of
lame in it-just a spark

  then philip smiled - a broad satis-
fied smile he went to the box which
he had opened and turned over its con-
tents until he found what looked like a
very fine white topaz presently he
gathered some dry leaves and sticks into
a little pile then he sat down and
proceeded to concentrate the sunlight
through the topaz upon the leaves

  the little spot of fire hurt his eyes
he looked at it so intently that it made
his brain reel and when lie looked away
for a moment he saw a big black spot
elsewhere

  for fifteen minutes he tried in vain
to make the leaves take fire the spot
beneath the concentrated ray would
blacken and singe but would not burst
into flame finally he arose in disgust
and pitched the topaz into the brush

   the only way to cook that fish he
said bitterly  is to lay it out in the
sunshine

  rendered desperate by hunger and
disappointment he went off in search of
a coconut he found one cut the end
open and drank the milk when he
returned to the mouth of the cave he
found the pile of leaves and dry sticks
blazing merrily

   a watched pot never boils quoth
philip laughing joyously the ray had
left a spark of fire singeing in the leaves
and then the breeze had done the rest

  in a short time he was hungrily eating
his fish which proved to be as delicate a
thing as he had ever tasted

   and now he reflected when his
hunger was partially appeased  what
next 

  his first idea was to hunt a pig but
he reckoned that luncheon would be
about due before he had procured one
having proven to himself that the treas-
ure was at least good for catching fish
he finally decided to spend a few hours
on the rocks the result was that lie
caught another fish but as he felt able
to dispense with a midday meal he de-
cided to fish on all afternoon

  toward sunset he caught another and
with his two fish he spent the rest of the
hours of daylight in making a fire and

cooking his dinner that night supple-
mented as it was with coconut milk and
coconut meat for dessert was a great suc-
cess

  after dinner philip was just think-
ing about the joys of the pipe which was
not in his possession when he noticed the
moon overhead previously he had ob-
served that the dusk was rather long
the knowledge that his evenings-for a
week at least-would be gladdened by
light cheered him greatly he em-
ployed the evening in the construction of
a club the nature and purpose of which
amused him immensely

   i wonder he mused  if a pig ever
died the glorious death of being hit oh
the head with a heathen image of gold
tied on the end of a stick 

  this indeed was the form and pur-
pose of the club having taken one of
the heaviest of the little inca gods from
the box he had tied it to the end of a
stick with a strip of silk which he had
found among the miscellaneous treasure

   now for the pigs  laughed philip
swinging the club

  he did not feel any great need of
sleep that night so he decided to lay in
wait for the pigs which he felt sure
would come back to their lair as soon
as all was quiet

  philip ensconced himself on a little
platform of ingots and waited expectant-
ly an hour went past then another
hour the moon was shining across the
mouth of the cave and he could not fail
to see any pig that tried to enter

  it was not until the third hour of his
watch that he heard a grunting in the
brush the sound came nearer pres-
ently there were numerous grunts

  theyre holding a council of war
chuckled the castaway fingering his
gold-mounted club expectantly

  whatever the pigs might have been
doing they seemed very wary of entering
the cave remembering no doubt-if a
pig has a memory-that certain strange
things had happened therein during the
last twenty-four hours

  philip was sitting  the ingots
fuming over the stupidity of pigs in gen-
eral when a shadow fell athwart the
cave mouth he waited for a moment
and presently a hog stood at the entrance
and grunted a challenge
	the railroad

  philip rashly accepted it he flung
the golden club with all his strength at
the pig which uttered a defiant squeal
and fled the club hit the rock buttress
at the left side of the cave and the
golden image came off the end

  now ive spoiled everything
groaned the castaway  they were just
coming in and now they wont come
back for a week what a fool  am

   i was too eager he said to himself
and sure that there would be no pigs to
disturb his rest he made the most of that
consolation and went to sleep

  he was right he had no fellow
lodgers when he awoke in the morning
angry at the fulfilment of his own
prophecy he mended the club and
widened the breach between himself and
the pigs by a vain pursuit of the whole
drove

  that third day on the island he spent
fishing and cooking it was the same
on the fourth day and the fifth final-
ly philip hated the taste even the
thought of fish

   i no sooner catch a fish and cook it
than it is time for me to go catch an-
other and cook it for the next meal

  thus he summed up his semihumor-
ous situation and decided that he needed
a change of diet the fifth night on
the island he heard the pigs grunting
about the mouth of the cave his first
impulse was to give chase the call of
a pork chop was strong upon him but
he remembered the grave consequence of
his earlier rashness and resolutely went
to sleep

  he awoke in the morning with an
idea it was this what was keeping
the pigs out of the only place where he
could hope to trap and kill one him-
self  then he must vacate the prem-
ises in favor of the pigs

   they are well-bred pigs said philip
to himself  they are used to the par-
lor and resent intrusion ill get out
and-call again

  that morning he was lucky with his
jeweled hook and line and got enough
fish to last him through the day the
afternoon of that sixth day he spent con-
structing a lean-to of branches in a shel-
tered corner of a rocky bluff the rock
afforded two walls of his house and the
rest was merely a matter of one side of

mans magazine

                                       

branches so that when finished his new
residence was a triangular thing with a
hole at the left where he cnuld crawl
in and out

  philip was mightily pleased with him-
self when he went to sleep in his new
house but in the middle of the night it
began to rain and as the lean-to was not
thatched he was very soon drenched

   and thats wet too said the philo-
sophic castaway as he stumbled through
the darkness in search of the pigs par-
lor as he had dubbed the treasure-cave

   thats one night lost in the cam-
paign against the pigs he reflected next
morning  it wont do it might be
dry for four or five nights and then i
might be forced back to the cave just as
the pigs were getting over their bashful-
ness 

  that morning as he was doing his
first fishing for breakfast a great idea
occurred to him

   i knew that treasure was good for
something he said to the sea  if
gibbys father et a were able to build a
wall with the gold-bricks why cant i

  after he had cooked his mornings
catch and eaten part of it he put up the
rest for luncheon and began the execu-
tion of his great scheme he hoped
that the pigs would not resent the shift-
ing of their parlor decorations but the
ingots were necessary to the sclrcme he
carried them two at a time to the cor-
ner of the rocky bluff where the lean-to
was he took down such of the con-
struction as the rain had not beaten
down then he drew two lines one out
from each face of rock so that the lines
met

  next he laid a foundation of big sil-
ver ingots and built upon them when
the silver ingots were finished he piled
on the golden ingots until he had a wall
about seven feet high he had left a
gap for the door and topped it with a
board and two rows of gold-bricks to
bring the top of the erection flush

  the next thing he did was to roof the
top with the branches he had used for
the lean-to then he climbed in a
roundabout way to the top of the bluff
and dropped down more branches the
roof he finished off with bits of turf
which lodged in the crevices as he
dropped them from above
treasure of the world

si y

  when he had thrown down a much
as the roof of branches could stand
philip returned to the beach and came
around to his brick house he looked
inside at the roof it was sagging a
little from the weight upon it but it
seemed solid enough

   of course itll leak thought philip 
 and if it gets soaked with rain the
w hole business might come down on my
head some night but a man whose house
is built of golden ingots shouldnt com-
plain about little inconveniences like
that

  he looked at the solid walls of metal
and for some strange reason he could
not help grinning extensively

  behold chuckled philip solo-
mon in all his glory all i need now is
a visit from the queen of sheba

  a shadow fell across the doorway
the castaway started and spun around
on his heel looking in upon him her
eyes wide with amazement relief and
unconcealed joy was miss verina
harding

chapter viii

the adventures of miss verina

aitss harding and philip sand
 stared at one another for a few
seconds the lady was the first to re-
cover

   oh mr sand she exclaimed  i
was never so glad to see any one in my
life 

   ell go farther than that miss
harding said philip   was never
so glad to see a particular any one
how d-do 

  then they stared at one another with
a kind of growing confusion

  what do you think of my house
asked philip at loss for a subject  i
built it myself its made of gold ex-
cept for the interior decorations-arbo-
real you might say

  she turned her eyes full upon his face
and into them came a look of sudden
alarm and pity he laughed

  no its all right miss harding
being castaway hasnt robbed me of my
sanity i mean what i say these
bricks are made of solid gold see
and he jabbed on the wall with his pen-

knife turning up a gleam of yellow
 its a treasure some gentlemen left
here about two hundred years ago

  miss hardings stare became fixed on
the golden wall things were coming
a bit too fast for her first she had
seen what looked like a human habita-
tion she had crept toward it and heard
a man quoting-scripture it sounded

  she had looked in and faced the man
whose fate had occupied her thoughts of
late and now philip sand was ex-
plaining that lie was not dead and that
his house was built of gold-bricks with
arboreal interior decorations if he had
not taken leave of his senses it seemed
certain to her that she had taken leave of
hers

  philip suddenly became aware of her
distressed condition he realized that
all this was news to miss harding

  oh pardon me he said hurriedly
 but i am afraid i have forgotten how-
to be hospitable but the pigs you see
are bashful-

  he stopped again miss hardings
eyes were filling with tears

   upon my word miss harding i
dont seem able to say anything that will
make you understand you see it is
such a queer story but do let me assure
you that i am quite well-and-and i
hope you are too you look well

   it is all-so sudden-and strange
she said doubtfully drawing back
against the wall which was real enough

    of course it is said philip  its
the oddest thing i ever heard of-or
read let me tell you in a word i
was washed ashore i thought all the
rest were drowned t found this treas-
ure first thing in a cave a little way
from here

   the cave was full of pigs-thats
what i meant by the pigs - and they
slept in that cave fancy pigs sleeping
on treasure miss harding

   they bothered me so that i had to
move out and build a house of branches
the rain came through so i finally hit
upon the idea of using the gold ingots
of the treasure for bricks i have just
finished building this house it isnt
bad is it   he concluded lamely

  she continued to regard him with a
confused puzzled stare and she had
thought that he was dead it was over-


the railroad mans magazine

powering to see him standing there in his
golden hut with the irresistible smile
playing about his quiet refined face
she wanted to do something to express
her feelings she had a suspicion that
if she did anything she would cry and
she did not want him to see her crying

  thats my story said he now
you must tell me yours - how you got
ashore how long you have been here
how it is i havent seen you before and
if there are any others on this island

    mine is a queer story too said she
 yes there are others on the island

   oh   said philip and somehow
he was disappointed tell me

  she  opened her mouth as if tocon-
tinue but suddenly a strange expression
came over her face her lips trembled
and a lively motion started in her fea-
tures

  oh heavens thought philip
 shes going to cry	

  and that was just what miss harding
was going to do-and did she sudden-
ly turned to the wall and laid her face
in her arms next moment her shoul-
ders were heaving and shaking and
philip could hear her vainly suppressed
sobs

  for an instant he was paralyzed with
embarrassment he had never had much
to do with women and was completely
at a loss as to the steps required in the
emergency his first impulse was to
put his arms around her and comforf
her as he had seen grown-up people do
with children but then miss harding
was not a child and at that moment
philip did not feel particularly grown
up

   instinct finally took the reins philip
stepped up to miss harding and laid
his right hand upon her shoulder very
gently

   dont mind me miss harding he
said  if it does you good have it out
youve been through a lot im sure
but now youre in good hands-that is
to say ill save you all the worry and
discomfort i can if you think youd
rather be alone ill-ill go and fish
she lifted her head quickly and turned
a tear-stained face to him

  no-dont she managed to say
 ill-be all-right-in a minute

  he smiled and stepped out into the

sunlight feeling instinctively for the
pipe and tobacco which he did not pos-
sess the circumstances-of the miss-
ing pipe-upset him more than anything
else had done since his arrival on the
island

  he stared at the sea he had stared
at it a good deal in the -past week but
now it seemed different he was trying
to connect that lonely waste with the
idea that miss harding was alive-and
was with him he had connected it so
with miss hardings death and absence

  it seemed unreal that she was with
him again pie realized for the first time
-he had refused to consider it before-
how much the girls actual existence
meant to him but he was not going to
consider it now in any other way than
that she was alive and that he was glad
she was alive

  she was the same miss harding only
circumstances were altered she was as
handsome as ever as attractive both
 uj higgs and as she had appealed to
philip she was wearing the same
clothes that she had had on that night
when he told the white lie about the
captain on the bridge

  her gown was soiled and a bit shabby
but it still set off her wonderful figure
she was just as beautiful in face too
and a shade of suffering around her eyes
a little pallor of the cheeks and a trem-
uleusness of her lips did not detract
from that beauty in fact these were
hardly blemishes for they heightened
her feminine appeal mainly because she
strove hard to hide the appeal

  he wondered where miss sharpe was
and who the others on the island were
and-

   mr sand said a voice from the
golden hut

  he turned to the door she came out
to meet him her face bore traces of
recent tears but she had downed them
and she was smiling bravely she held
but her hand

   let us begin over again she said
 how do you do mr sand i am
very glad that you are alive now tell
me your story over again	

  they sat down on the sand together
and philip repeated his story-this time
in detail pte had a way of interpreting
things - the way that his philosophic
treasure of the world



humorous temperament saw them be-
fore he was done she was laughing heart-
ily over his adventures with the pigs and
his trials with the fish and the culinary
department

   im so glad i can cook said she
 i would hate to be dependent on your
makeshift cookery

   ye-es said philip day-dreaming for
the moment  you may consider your-
self engaged of course you couldnt
cook much without me to do the fishing
i have a great ambition to kill a pig
but before we make plans for laying up
a store of pickled pork against emer-
gency  would like to hear your story
  am afraid i cant convey a definite
idea of what happened she said  but
after i called to you-i meant to warn
you that the ship was aground- went
on deck they were lowering the boats
and in the excitement miss sharpe and
i got separated

  philip glanced sideways at miss hard-
ing she had paused and he could see
that she was mastering her emotion
philip concluded at once that it would
be better not to press inquiries after miss
sharpe

   i was the only woman in the boat
they put me into there were five sai-
lors and another man who kept very
quiet i thought it was another of the
crew until he came to the stern of the
boat and told me that he had come to
take care of me and that he had had to
slip into the boat unnoticed it was that
creature higgs

  humph grunted philip

   we hadnt the faintest idea where
we were-at least i hadnt the ship
went down and-oh it was awful we
could hear them crying out in the black
sea and-there was a man called out to
us quite near the boat but they paid no
attention to him

   i got ashore though  philip
chuckled to himself

   the crew rowed away into the storm

i dont think they knew where they were
going but they said they must get clear
of the reef and stand by till morning
while they were rowing this way and
that a pair of arms came over the side
of the boat and a man commanded them
to take him in

    i stood by my ship till she went

   	r r

down he said in a queer way  and
thats as far as a masters duty goes

   they pulled him into the boat i
expected to find that it was captain
rodgers but it was a strange man whom
 had never seen before he-he had
been drinking too and he swore fright-
fully and paid not the least attention to
me i made out that he was the cap-
tain but  could not understand this
until afterward you need not look so
guilty mr sand you did the right
thing

   that was what i thought said
philip readily

   the man who said he was captain-
his name was howells and he had been
the mate before captain rodgers went
overboard-he ordered the men to row
to the east he said there were lots of
islands about and they could land on
one as soon as it was daylight

   when it got light there were a num-
ber of islands sure enough we could
see this one but the boat had traveled
nearer to another island which is east
of this one we landed there

  miss harding paused philip under-
stood that the next part of her story was
not pleasant narrative

   it is an awful place that island
she said  it isall sand and rock at
one end there is a patch of tangled grass
which barely covers the sand and there
are some coconut-palms we camped
there and i slept while most of the men
went off in search of food and water

  again she paused

  yes said philip

   only two of them remained - the
captain and the man higgs i cant tell 
you what an obnoxious creature that man
higgs is the captain is not a very
pleasant person but when he sobered
up he kept to himself and ever since he
has hardly spoken a word i think he
feels guilty of negligence

   higgs told me that it was mr
howells first ship and he had lost her
within twelve hours of his taking com-
mand i can understand how the man
felt when he became sober-and realized

  and higgs said philip gently

  higgs when i awoke he was sit-
ting beside me he told me that he was
never going to leave me that he was
going to protect me oh you cannot


the railroad mans magazine

imagine how odious an unwelcome pro-
tector is to a woman  would rather
have had the meanest of the sailors-
and they were a poor ignorant inoffen-
sive lot-than that man but i had to
appear grateful while i just sickened at
his presence

   never mind mr higgs said philip
quietly he did not offer you any-
that is he gave his very best imitation
of a gentleman

  oh yes he-he was very attentive
but i kept him at a distance once-
only once - i told him that i would
rather be left alone and that the sailors
would do all that i wished

    all right said philip quickly  so
much for higgs you found the sailors
-not so bad  

   poor fellows she said  they
worked hard all day trying to find water
and food when they didnt things
looked so black that i do not think they
were even aware of my presence they
tried to devise a hook and line to fish
with but they failed

   we had nothing but rancid coconuts
to eat and there were a few fresh ones
the second day they found water but
it had a taste of the sea in it and was
not much good except for cooking they
cooked shellfish and things and one of
the men made coconut-oil which took
away the awful taste of some of the
tilings we ate but we managed

   things went on like this for several
days the men were waiting for the
mate to give orders but he kept to him-
self and walked about the beach like a
crazy man finally the men went to him
in a body and said that they ought to
launch the boat and come to this island
which was quite clear to us we could
see that it had plenty of trees and they
said that meant good water and per-
haps there might be somebody living on
it

   there was said philip with a
smile

   the captain agreed i think he
would have agreed to anything he was
so dazed yesterday the boat was
launched and we put to sea again it
was only about five miles but it took
us nearly five hours to get here the cur-
rents were so queer and the sea was

heavy we finally landed about sunset
-last night-and had plenty to eat

   eh   said philip then he laughed
and inwardly estimated his own intelli-
gence

   last night miss harding said  the
man higgs made me promise that i
would go for a walk this morning he
told me it was a beautif-td island and i
must come and see the lovely woods
his idea was that i should walk with
him i promised that i would  go for
a walk to get rid of him and this
morning before the others were stirring
i stole away and here i am

   and now that you are here said
philip after a long silence  i think
you had better remain you need not
be afraid that i shall be as attentive as
the willing higgs but i can assure you
fish for breakfast and a house to live in
maybe in time we will have pork
chops

   but- she said

   its all right said philip with
studied indifference  ill go back to
my country residence with the pigs
you can have this summer palace but
if you dont mind ill take my meals
here i am not particular about the
husks but i draw the line at eating with
the swine

   very well she said  it is very
kind of you

   its the least i can do in return for
my good fortune said philip seriously
 i need not hide from you miss hard-
ing that your comirfg has brightened the
outlook tremendously it has been hard
work laughing by myself now we will
try and laugh through things together
he was standing bareheaded before
her as he made this little speech she
looked up at him at first with the grav-
ity of one who perceived sincerity over-
topping gallantry then with a smile of
gratitude she held out her hand

   i wont hide from you mr sand
that i am very glad it is you

  five minutes later philip sand was
walking alone toward the camp of the
shipwrecked men wondering just what
he would do to mr higgs when he
found him and what effect the treasure
would have upon those  poor ignorant
inoffensive  sailors

to be continued
he had a glimpse of what
looked very much
like a man

 whos got the turkey

       by percy wilson

the eagle eye and the head shack discover
the difference between lark and larceny

  skeeter was not in a companionable
mood that morning he notified his
wife that he had secured permission to
be off duty on thanksgiving day that
he might enjoy one of her incomparable
turkey dinners mrs cook - treasurer
of the skeeter household and chairman
of the board as well-had tartly remind-
ed him that he had been bringing her
home very skimpy pay-envelopes for the
past several months and that if he ex-
pected the national fowl to grace his
table he would have to provide it him-
self-or else eat pork

  being short of funds and knowing no
kind friend who would donate a bird


                the through freight
vest engineer howland
nd conductor gillip lay
 the siding at welsh
zreek waiting for the
chesapeake despatch the
fast freight to pass east it was a raw
drizzly afternoon in late november and
skeeter cook the front shack having
dutifully ridden out on the train for the
last fifteen miles had come ahead to
join the little company in the engine-
cab not that he had any particular de-
sire for comradeship but merely that he
might dry some of the moisture from his
garments and warm his chilled person


the railroad mans magazine

skeeter was the allegory of depression
his condition was trebly aggravated by
the continued melody from a neighboring
farm building-the angry  gobble gob-
ble gobble  of a disturbed turkey-cock
 shut up  muttered skeeter acidly
whats the matter skeet in-
quired the engineer taking smiling note
of the circumstance  dont you like to
hear that turkeys call it sounds to
me like he was inviting us to dinner
with thanksgiving only three days off
um-m-m-m   the engineer rolled his
eyes and patted himself comfortably in
pleasant anticipation

  you shut up too retorted skeeter
scowling  i reckon i know thanks-
givins only three days yet and patchen
promised to let me off but whats the
use my old woman says its hog meat
for me--turkeys is too high hog meat
on thanksgivin 

  howland chuckled too high he
repeated winking across at gil lip who
sat on the firemans side  they must
be roosting on balloons then skeet if
thats your trouble i swear youd climb
to the top of a california redwood to
steal one

  oh would  retorted skeeter
would i if i did id moren likely
meet you coinin down with it

  this referred to an incident in how-
lands firing days when on a marauding
expedition with several others he was
coining down a tree with a fine bird and
unexpectedly met the legitimate owner
whom he was compelled to reimburse at
a fancy price it was a body blow and
skeeter permitted himself a grim smile

   thats right tell him about it
skeet urged gillip  ha ha thats
one on you howland youd better at-
tend to your bright-works and let skeeter
alone id sooner trust him than you
anyhow for youve been caught at it and
ive never heard that skeeter was

   i never done it declared skeeter
piously

   all that i ever did myself said
howland  i did just for the fun of it
 if i cant buy what i want to eat
went on skeeter taking a high moral
stand  i can go hungry thats me
 good boy  said the engineer with
laughing approval  never steal be-
cause youre hungry skeet when you

go after the birds just for the fun of it
its only a lark but when you take them
because you need them its larceny
thats the difference

    i believe you declared skeeter

  guff broke in gillip neither
of you are any too good to rob a roost
if i was old man wentzel back there
-pointing toward the farm buildings-
 id be patrolling that flock with a shot-
gun every night from now till new-
years

   skeeter and howland turned their eyes
in the direction bv george ex-
claimed howland  theyre a nice bunch
arent they does he let them roost there
under the barn bridge

    ah ha   cried oillip  youre fig-
uring how to get one are you  

  skeeter who had been eying the fas-
cinating sight greedily started guiltily at
the question and was about to retort in-
dignantly seeing that it was the en-
gineer who had been addressed he wisely
held his peace

   no gillip howland replied sha-
king his head  no my days for such
tricks are over im getting too heavy
to handle myself like i used to im a
down-and-outer i reckon those were
good old days though he added regret-
fully

    there comes the  peake put in the
heretofore silent fireman thus remind-
ing them of their duties he got down to
take a look at his fire howland gave a
light burnish to the throttle and the lever
with a handful of waste and tried his
sand

  gillip pulled out his time-table and
watch and made a mental calculation
while skeeter buttoning his coat and
turning up the collar against the
weather swung down and started toward
the switch

  when he reached the front of the en-
gine he stepped between the rails where
he could not be observed from the cab
and looked longingly toward the barn
how he did hunger for a thanksgiving
turkey old man wentzel could easily
spare him one out of that bunch and
scarcely miss it but old man wrentzel
didnt know of skeeters wants and the
despatch rolled by and skeeter let his
own train out at the switch and went on
with it
whos got the turkey



  gill ip and his crew should have made
their return trip by daylight the follow-
ing day but having been held at their
western terminal for freight delayed be-
hind a wreck on the connecting division
it was almost ten oclock at night when
they were nearing bonita the passing
siding first west of welsh creek

  if the longing of skeeter for a festal
bird to adorn his thanksgiving board
suffered any diminution when he realized
bow hopeless a prospect it was it became
intensified when he saw that they would
pass through welsh creek eastward in
the still hours of the night the rain
of the previous day had ceased and given
way to colder wreather without entirely
clearing  and when night came on heavy
clouds obscured the moon

  this of course was greatly in skeeters
favor but what was almost insuperably

against him was the general avoidance
at welsh creek siding by east - bound
freights on account of the difficulty in
starting from that point with a heavy
train if the passing siding next east
that at markley could not be reached it
was policy to go in at bonita rather than
run the risk of having to seesaw out of
welsh creek hole

  but even this difficulty skeeter finally
planned to overcome from the time
they were making he figured that they
could not reach markley to clear the
night express no  and would have
to go in at bonita while they were in
there he designed to arrange a little
 brake trouble  that would act as a
drag when they tried to go up the hill
east of welsh creek and thus compel
them to back to the siding and lie there
for time freight no s

when howland came lumbering over the edge of the cut half rolling and half
sliding to the bottom skeeter was waiting for him


the railroad mans magazine

  this would give him all the time he
needed and as a salve to his conscience
for abstracting a turkey from farmer
wentzels flock without mutual arrange-
ment he persuaded himself that he would
forward the value of it anonymously
from his next pay-and sincerely hoped
he might succeed

  with everything thus planned he came
confidently ahead on nearing bonita to
be ready to open ihe switch  we can
hardly make marklev i reckon how-
land he heard the conductor say  bet-
ter go in here hadnt we

  howland looked at his watch skeeter
looked at his noting once more that the
time was scant and knowing the engi-
neers usual aversion to taking risks he
was dumfounded to hear howland re-
ply we ought to be able to do it
we can if the old boat hangs together
lets try

  the lights of bonita were far to the
rear before skeeter began to recover
from the effects of this death-blow life
seemed a vale of gloom until turning a
baleful look on howland whom he held
to be the cause of all his griefs he no-
ticed that the engineer was beginning to
act strangely

  easing his bar hanging out the win-
dow  trying the throttle at various
notches listening with sharp ear to
every click of the machinery all the
while muttering to himself howlands
actions indicated that the  old boat 
was not hanging together

  when turning to the conductor he
said  well have to go in at welsh
creek gillip that right crosshead
keys working loose skeeter could
scarcely restrain himself hang it i
told corcoran when he was putting the
stud-bolt in that he was stripping the
thread the engineer went on  im
afraid to hit the hill with it the way it
knocks dont you hear it

  gillip hadnt heard the unmention-
able old kettle knocked so unmentionably
all over that he couldnt tell one knock
from another he supposed hed have to
take howlands word all he knew was
that at this rate they wouldnt get home
for a week

  skeeter however came to the engi-
neers support with the declaration that
he had been hearing it very distinctly

and had been on the point of mentioning
it when he saw that howland heard it
too  pretty bad aint it  asked skee-
ter

  howland made no reply his look
even intimated that he didnt believe
skeeter knew what he was talking about
but skeeter did for he was talking to
get twenty minutes or more in welsh
creek siding regardless of how it was
brought into effect

   stopping the train as soon as the rear
end was well into clear howland
dropped off with hammer and wrench 
and he was tapping the head of the key
when skeeter and gillip appeared to
learn how long it would take to make
the repair they could follow no 
close howland said if gillip would go
to the telegraph office and get the block
held for them immediately after the ex-
press had passed

  by backing out of the siding and ta-
king that much of a run at the hill he
thought they should be able to get over
it without having to double  and you
had better look over your brakes care-
fully skeet he suggested  for we
dont want to hang up

  at any other time skeeter would have
retorted that the brakes were all right
that that was his business and he at-
tended to it that if the air was handled
the way it should be there wouldnt be
any trouble with the brakes in the pres-
ent instance however he merely waited
until the conductor had gone ahead
toward the office and then started duti-
fully back along the train

  with some concern he noticed that the
sky was growing lighter with the wind
beginning to sweep the lower heavier
clouds before it there was need of haste
moreover as the engine was standing
nearly opposite the barn every step took
him farther from his point of attack

  when he bad gone about seven car-
lengths he glanced over his shoulder
and seeing nothing of howland or his
torch stepped between two cars and
jerked out his light then looking out
and still seeing no sign of the engineer
he hung his lamp on an uncoupling-
lever and stepped down the low bank

  with the sound of his footsteps
drowned by the rustle of the wind
through the dried leaves of the corn he
whos got the turkey



made his way in safety across the field
just as he reached the fence separating
the field from the barn enclosure an edge
of the moon shone out quickly he
dropped down

  he was not certain if it were the
passing shadow of a cloud or perhaps
merely his imagination-but he had a
glimpse of what looked very much like a
mail crouching close against the side of
the barn bridge

  for nearly a minute skeeter remained
there undetermined what to do being
loth to give up now that he was close
to his goal and the moon being obscured
behind a very large and heavy cloud he
crept along the fence and crawling be-
tween the bars made his way cautiously
to the farther side of the bridge

  a glance toward the house showed no
light a moments intense listening re-
vealed no distinguishable sound but his
own breathing taking fresh courage
he lowered his head and stepped softly
into the pitch-black darkness beneath the
incline

  the pungent aroma that attacked his
nostrils left him in no doubt of having
come to the right place a fence rail
stretching from wall to wall met his
hand but as he felt cautiously along it
he experienced something of dismay at
finding it unoccupied he reached anx-
iously forward and touched another

  his hand was scarcely on this one
when something like flesh struck his
little finger and immediately another
hand made a sweep at his own it
brushed his knuckles as he snatched them
away

  it needed nothing more to convince
skeeter that the form revealed crouch-
ing alongside the barn bridge must have
been the farmer who having seen him
as he came across the field had thus en-
couraged him to walk into the trap and
be caught

  but he was not caught yet and back-
ing hurriedly into the open as he heard
the other scrambling toward the farther
end he circled around a wagon-shed
made a detour to get behind the house
and raced from there toward the field

  the moon came out before he reached
the fence and as he crawled beside it
scarcely daring to breathe and listening
sharply for sounds of pursuit he saw

that the sky was clearing rapidly from
the absence of any sound of footsteps
he feared that the farmer instead of fol-
lowing him was watching to cut him off
his safest plan was to follow a shallow
gully leading eastward of the engine and
to move only when the moon was ob-
scured

  three times he was compelled to stop
in the shadow of a corn-shock he was
about to make his last dash for the rail-
road and crossing it come around the
farther side to avoid his mates when he
saw in the beams from the head-light
that gillip was coming up from the of-
fice

  changing his course he ran up the
hill and as the moon came out once
more took refuge against a shock al-
most opposite the engine-cab and about
five yards from the edge of the cut in
which it stood just in time to see a burly
form stagger out of the moonlight into
the shock next ahead it was howland

   it required several seconds for skeeter
to grasp the situation when he did it
was with an outraged feeling of chagrin
and disgust after all his planning and
trouble to have no turkey and all on ac-
count of howland was too much

  hed like to- by cricky he won-
dered if howland had seen him after
a moments reflection he felt assured that
he hadnt and the instant there came a
shadow he darted toward the engine-cab
and slid down the bank

  when plowland came lumbering over
the edge of the cut half rolling and half
sliding to the bottom skeeter was wait-
ing for him

   youre a nice christian you are 
he began sarcastically  you make be-
lieve your engines broke down dont
you  but what youre after is turkeys
i know didnt i see you its a pity
that farmer didnt-

   sh-h-h-h   warned howland puf-
fing and blowing  here comes-gil-
lip sh-h-h-h

  o-ho said skeeter you dont
want him to know do you well im
going to tell him and-

   no urged the engineer  dont
leave him to me ill fix it right with
you

   i thought i saw you fellows in a
mix-up said the conductor as he came


the railroad mans magazine

  skeeter nudged howland and mo-
tioned to the turkey very significantly
in fact it was a threat

  howland took the hint say gil-
lip he asked how much will you
take for that youve got one at home
now you dont need another

   two-fifty said gillip

   done said howland and the ex-
change was made gillip started to
climb up on the engine

 here skeet said the engineer loud-
ly   heres your bird you won the bet
you threw me fair and dropping his

closer  and youre all covered with
dirt howland what have you been
scrapping about now  

  howland nudged the brakeman to
keep silence just a little friendly
wrestle he panted  but say -star-
ing at the article in the conductors right
hand-where did you get that
this said gillip holding up a
young hen turkey  old man wentzel

his whole flock skeeter was on the point of exclaiming

gave me this a fellow from baltimores
been around here the last two days buy-
ing every turkey he could find old
wentzel sold his whole flock-

   his whole hock  skeeter was on
the point of exclaiming when he checked
himself howlands eyes were as big as
switch-lights

   and hes down at the station loading
them into a car with the rest for no si
to pick up  helped him rack up his
coops and he opened his heart

voice to a whisper  dont you ever
sav anything-or ill never hear the last
of it

  in giving the fowl into skeeters
hands his own hand brushed the brake-
mans little finger and he straightened
back with a jerk  look here  he ex-
claimed in a husky whisper  you were
the fellow on the other side of that-

  skeeter grinned  mebbe i was he
retorted starting off with his prize
 but you cant prove it
how railroad men balked a
plot to assassinate lincoln

by bertram adler

just after the close of the civil war plots to assassinate abraham
lincoln were hatched thick and fast one carefully prepared scheme
to take the life of the great emancipator was nipped in the bud by
the railroad men in charge of the train  which he was traveling to wash-
ington they worked in conjunction with the pinkerton forces and they
did their work faithfully and loyally as the following chronicle of that
historical happening will show

the members of a band of baltimore conspirators awake to find
themselves cheated in their attempt to prevent
the inauguration

house of pinkerton was closeted with
the railroad president in a nearby hotel
were four picked aides whom the detec-
tive had brought east with him with
the president in the railroad council
chamber was one other official henry
f kenney mr feltons superintendent
when the conference ended pinkerton
summoned his aides and sent them forth
to find -the truth or untruth in the plot
rumors

  they returned with a complete cor-
roboration of the rumors washington
was to be made isolated by the maryland
secessionists furthermore the isola-
tion was to become effective quickly-
and lincoln the president-elect was
never to reach washington for his in-
auguration when mr felton had heard
the reports through he turned to pinker-
ton

 allan he said  can you change
your headquarters to the east

 i can answered pinkerton

 can you bring every one of your
detectives here  

 i can

          ne morning early in the year
 samuel h felton
president of the philadel-
phia wilmington and bal-
timore railroad rushed to
his private desk in the ex-
ecutive offices at philadelphia and scrib-
bled a letter which he directed his clerk
to get into the first mail west the
clerk noticed that the letter was ad-
dressed to allan pinkerton at chicago

  gee he exclaimed another rob-
bery  

  the  bosss  letter dealt with more
important matters than mere theft of
money it dealt with rumors of an at-
tempt on the part of southern sympa-
thizers in maryland to isolate the capital
of the loyal states by preventing ap-
proach to it by train the last link in
the route to washington was president
feltons road and its tracks were to be
demolished and its bridges destroyed
whatever information mr felton had
of the great plot the letter to pinkerton
contained

  several davs later the head of the


the railroad mans magazine

plunging through the police ranks to the side
of the carriage he handed mr judd
a slip of paper

   can you guarantee to stay here your-
self 

   i can answered pinkerton- but
why do you ask this

   your men will guard my road said
felton  you and  will ride mr lin-
coln over it

  at every danger-point a detective was
stationed every bridge and ferry tra-
versed by the road was kept under the
surveillance of pinkerton men in the
guise of laborers ostensible trackmen
watched every inch of rail and telegraph
wire through the disloyal parts of mary-
land

  pinkerton himself spent much of his
time in baltimore where he soon un-
earthed the chief plans of the southern
sympathizers then he hastened to
philadelphia and mr felton with his in-
formation

   the assassination he stated  is
to take place at the calvert street depot
of your road a vast crowd of secession-
ists are to assemble there and await the
arrival of mr lincolns train they
are to appear early and to fill the narrow
streets and passages immediately sur-
rounding the depot

   the marshal of police is a southern
sympathizer and is conversant with the
assassination plans he will detail but
a small force of-police to attend the ar-
rival and nominally clear and protect a
passage for mr lincoln and his suite
v when the train enters the depot and

mr lincoln attempts to go through the
narrow passage leading to the streets a
party already delegated is to engage in
a conflict on the outside the police are
to rush away to quell the disturbance

   at this moment the police being
entirely withdrawn mr lincoln will
find himself surrounded by a dense and
excited crowd hustling and jamming
against him then the fatal blow is to be
struck a boat waiting on the chesa-
peake shore is ready to take the assassin
on board a swift steamer which will con-
vey him to a southern port

  the situation was really alarming and
heroic measures were in order it was
decided to obtain a speedy interview with
mr lincoln submit the facts squarely to
him and abide by his suggestions

  this meeting between the detective and
the railroad officer took place on feb-
ruary  the president-elect was ex-
pected to arrive in philadelphia en route
for his inaugural on the following day
all philadelphia had prepared to wel-
come him the entire militia of the city
was to act as escort from the railroad
depot to the continental hotel where
he was to receive the congratulations of
the people

  just before the presidential party left
new york for the quaker city one of
a plot to assassinate lincoln



  the young man was a
messenger from felton
and pinkerton and
j h hutchinson
was the name under
which pinkerton had reg-
istered at the hotel to
avoid the curiosity of
any emissary of the
baltimore conspirators
who mighthave chanced
that way

  shortly after the ar-
rival of the president-
elect at the continental
hotel mr judd was an-
nounced to felton and
 i n k e r t o  at the st
louis all proofs rela-
ting to the conspiracy
were submitted to mr
judd and when he had
satisfied himself about
them it was suggested
that mr lincoln should
proceed  the eleven
oclock night train to
washington where gen-
eral scott could guar-
antee him safety

mr pinkertons assistants met mr nor-
man b judd of the official escort and
arranged for an interview between fel-
ton pinkerton and judd at philadelphia

  when mr lincoln arrived the en-
thusiasm of the populace was unbound-
ed the great military and civic pro-
cession escorted the new chief magistrate -
through streets black with people on
each side of the carriage in which were
mr lincoln and mr judd marched a
file of police whose duty it was to pre-
vent the multitude from pressing too
closely to the vehicle

  as the procession reached the corner
of broad and chestnut streets a young
man in the crowd tried to attract the at-
tention of the occupants of the carriage
he found this impossible plunging
through the police ranks
to the side of the car-
riage he handed mr

judd a slip of paper on
which was written

 st louis hotel ask
 for j ii hutchinson

  mr judd agreed to go with felton
and pinkerton to the president-elect and
place the facts before him

  at mr judds request lincoln ex-
cused himself to the throngs in the hotel
parlors and received the party in private

   but gentlemen he said while they
were discussing the matter  while i
can stand anything that is necessary
i cannot -go to washington to-night i

  lincolns firm tone indicated the use-
lessness of attempting to have him alter
his opinion and a second conference was
held in mr judds room to which
thomas a scott vice-president of the
pennsylvania central railroad was
summoned mr scott however could
not be found but
george c franciscus
the general manager of
the pennsylvania cen-
tral was reached so
was e s sanford
president of the amer-
ican telegraph com-
pany at this meeting
the railroad officials
the telegraph official
and the detective went
over the s i t u a tion
carefully and the fol-
lowing program was
decided upon

  after the formal re-
ception at harrisburg
a special train consist-
ing of a baggage - car
and one passenger-
coach should leave
there at six oclock
pm to carry mr lin-
coln and one compan-
ion back to philadel-
phia this tram was
to be under the imme-
diate control of mr

franciscus and enoch
lewis the general
superintendent

  in order to avoid the
possibility of accident
the track was to be
cleared of everything
between harrisburg
and philadelphia from
 oclock until after
the passage of the spe-
cial train mr felton
was to detain the eleven
oclock pm baltimore
precaution was secretly taken

  mrs warne a woman detective en-
gaged a berth in the sleeping-car bound
for baltimore mr judd was to man-
age affairs at harrisburg and pinkerton
at philadelphia

  the next morning lincoln drew the

he went immediately to his
berth

 train

every

stars and stripes to the top of inde-
pendence hall flagstaff and delivered
a speech that is historical the ceremo-
nies over he was driven back to the
continental hotel where he found
awaiting him frederick seward the son
of william h seward seward told
lincoln that he had
just arrived from
washington that his
father and general
scott had sent him
to warn the president-
elect of the danger of
passing through balti-
more and to urge him
to start immediately
for the capital

  the advices which
actuated the message
came as substantiation
to the information
which pinkerton had
obtained for mr fel-
ton mr lincoln
evinced no further hes-
itancy in the matter
and signified his im-
mediate willingness to
do whatever was re-
quired of him mr
judd who was at lin-
colns side then direct-
ed mr seward to in-
form iris father and
general scott that
everything had been
arranged to place the
president - elect safely
in washington before
the evening of the fol-
lowing day

  lincoln started for
harrisburg and judd
and pinkerton busied
themselves carrying out
the program pinker-
ton had received re-
ports from baltimore
stating that the excitement there had
grown intense and that the arrival of
the president-elect was eagerly awaited

  the common belief was that lincoln
would journey from harrisburg to bal-
timore over the northern central rail-
road and the plans of the conspirators
were laid accordingly
a plot to assassinate lincoln



  it was important that no hint of the
contemplated movement of the presiden-
tial party should reach the monument
city agents of the conspirators were
found to be following and it appeared
certain that they would apprise their
leaders by telegraph of lincolns ab-
sence as soon as they discovered it

  to prevent this the american tele-
graph company detailed a trustworthy
lineman to render useless for the time
every wire leading from harrisburg

  this the lineman easily accomplished
by placing fine copper - ground wires
among the regular lilies and harrisburg
was entirely cut off from the rest of the
world president sanford of the amer-
ican telegraph company directed his
manager to remain in the office during
the night and intercept any despatches
that might be sent from any point be-
tween harrisburg and baltimore

- on the way to harrisburg mr judd
acquainted lincoln with the final plans
judd suggested that lincoln take the
other members of the presidential party
into his confidence lincoln accepted
the suggestion and at the jones house
in harrisburg he informed the escort of
the proposed night ride to baltimore

  the gentlemen comprising the escort
were judge david davis afterward
of the united states supreme court
major-general sumner major-general
david hunter major-general john
pope and ward h lamon afterward
united states marshal for the district
of columbia having thoroughly en-
lightened them as to his plans lincoln
accompanied them to the dining-room

  it was late afternoon and the special
train was on a side track just outside of
harrisburg waiting supposedly to take
the officers of the railroad company back
to philadelphia at philadelphia the
rear half of a sleeping-car of the balti-
more train had been retained for lin-
coln and a curtain separated it from
the rest of the coach

  in order to detain the train until the
arrival of the lincoln special from har-
risburg conductor john litzenburg was
directed not to start until he received
his orders personally from superin-
tendent kenney who was to give him
an important package which president
felton wished delivered in washington

   at  oclock a carriage drove up
 to the side entrance of the jones house
 two minutes later a message was hand-
 ed the president-elect by secretary john
 nicolav lincoln looked at it and
 straightaway went to his room

   he summoned governor curtin of
  pennsylvania to his side and proceeded
 with him to the carriage at the side en-
 trance seeing lincoln in company with
 their governor the crowds in and about
 the hotel decided that the distinguished
 pair were going to the executive man-
 sion where a reception was announced
 for the evening

   with mr lamon of the escort the
 president-elect and the governor entered
 the carriage and a little later they were
 speeding to philadelphia on the special

   they arrived at philadelphia at 
 pm and found allan pinkerton and
 superintendent kenney waiting with a
 carriage lincoln lamon and pinker-
 ton entered kenney seated himself on
 the box with the driver and the carriage
 whirled off to the depot of the phila-
 delphia wilmington and baltimore
 railroad

   there the carriage stopped in the
 shadow of a fence and the transfer of
 its distinguished occupant to the balti-
 more train was quietly effected super-
 intendent kenney gave conductor lit-
 zenburg the washington package and the
 order to start and the night ride to
 baltimore began how safe lincoln
 felt in the hands of the railroad men
 was evidenced by the fact that lie went
 immediately to his berth where he fell
 into a calm sleep

   the change to the washington train
 at baltimore was made without accident
 and at six oclock in the morning lin-
 coln arrived at the capital

   the baltimore conspirators awoke to
 find themselves cheated of their prey
 and vented their rage on the massachu-
 setts sixth two months later in the his-
 torical mob attack wherein the first blood
 of the civil war was spilt

   that lincoln did live to be inaugu-
 rated is history-but the work of sev-
 eral railroad men toward that end is
 not you will find no mention of fel-
 ton franciscus lewis kenney feltons
 detective or sanford in the text-books

    it was all in their days work
railroad in your back garden

how some of our rich english cousins manage to move about
their ancestral acres without the trouble
of walking

railroading as a private hobby or
as a private convenience would not
on the- face of it seem to have a very ex-
tensive appeal nevertheless there are
several private railroads notably in england
which have been constructed for the pleasure
or private convenience of certain rich men
some of these roads are not by any means
toys and the lilliputian dimensions of their
track and rolling stock only add to their
interest

  some time ago the scientific american
published an excellent article with photo-
graphs dealing with several of these private
english railroads and from this article we
have taken the liberty to draw for our in-
formation the english correspondent of
the scientific american says

   the most notable of these private diminu-
tive railroads are those at eaton hall in
cheshire the country seat of the duke of
westminster duffield bank the home of
sir percival heywood bart and blakesley
hall where resides mr c h bartholomew
a retired civil engineer and contemporary of
the stephensons

  these railroads are not mere toys but
exact replicas upon a reduced scale of the
ordinary standard systems of the country
correct in every particular including track
signaling equipment rolling stock etc

   the miniature railroad at duffield bank
was designed and constructed by its owner
sir percival heywood who is a recognized
authority in such work and is an enthusias-
tic advocate of light railroads this par-
ticular line is one mile in length exclusive
of side-tracks extending through the estate
the gage is fifteen inches the track alone
cost four thousand five hundred dollars in
its course the line passes through three tun-
nels traverses two bridges of the wooden

trestle type and a timber viaduct of ninety
feet in length by twenty feet in height
there are six stations along the route which
convey guests to the various parts of the
estate

   the private railroad of the duke of
westminster is of a more ambitious charac-
ter it runs through the eaton hall estate
and links the residence with the trunk
railroad system at balderton three and a
half miles distant this line was also de-
signed and constructed by sir percival hey-
wood and is also of fifteen-inch gage the
whole system comprises four and one-half
miles of track including the direct through
line three and one-lialf miles long and ap-
proximately one mile of side-tracks

   the track is built upon the latest ap-
proved style with vignole rails averaging
twelve pounds per yard laid on longitudinal
wooden cross-ties and cost exclusive of
buildings and rolling stock six thousand five
hundred and forty-five dollars per mile rep-
resenting an outlay of over twenty-nine
thousand four hundred and fifty dollars in
track alone the gradients vary from one
in one hundred to a maximum of one in
sixty-five

   this railroad is essentially employed for
the transportation of freight to and from the
house though members of the family and
their guests travel between the main-line
station and the mansion there being for
such purpose a number of open vehicles and
a bogie parlor-car capable of seating sixteen
persons

   the utility of such a railroad as this in
connection with such a country seat and
the heavy work it has to fulfil may be
gathered from the fact that the trains cover
five thousand miles and transport over six
thousand tons of freight a year

                light amusement proves instructive
                and a walking delegate falls down

               synopsis of previous chapters

larry smith and jack marley being in possession of some valuable water-rights
j are building a dam smith being the engineer and marley supplying half the
capital the other half of the capital is supplied by a denver capitalist named briggs
and another man named garth briggs comes to view the work and while there lie drops
half of a broken shilling which marley picks up the capitalist is interested as a
money-lender and not as a partner and he holds a mortgage on the dam and all the
rights subject to a time-limit for the completion of the work

chapter iv

moving pictures

ariy the next morning lar-
  ry walked up to murdock
  who was watching a group
  of men fit the gate into
  one of the sluices that had
  just been completed

  i want you to stop the masonry-
work above there lie said  and put
the men at work on the pipe down by
klingerman pass

 whats that murdock stared at
the engineer in surprise

  larry repeated the instructions

 well i dont know about it said
murdock slowly whats the reason
 simply that i wish to get the pipe-
done quickly and turn a little water into
it replied larry coolly

   you havent enough inspectors there
to keep up with such a rush

   thats my lookout as a matter of
fact jones and armsbv have worked out
the formula for all the pipe that re-
mains to be built and they are ready to
give you the spacings

  it may be explained that a stave-pipc
is built on the principle of a virtually
endless barrel without a bulge the stave
being of different lengths at intervals
which vary in accordance with the head

of water to be carried-in its undulations
up and down over a surface that is only
partially graded - steel rods must be
boiled around the pipe

  the distance between the rods may be
several inches at places where the level
of the pipe is nearly as high as the level
of the source of the water - supply
where the head of water is great the
rods must be placed much closer to-
gether

  as the rods are a considerable item of
expense the contractor would be glad to
space them as far apart as possible but
the engineers working from formulas de-
termine the correct spacing for every
level of pipe this was the work which
jones and armsby were doing for
larry

  murdock may have realized that if
the pipe was crowded to completion any
effort to make delays on the remaining
courses of masonry would be palpable
at least he was reluctant to concentrate
his forces on the pipe

  he could not well refuse to obey
larrys order however and in the end
he agreed and after the noon meal
sixty men were sent down to klinger-
man pass with their outfits for like
the others who were already at work on
the pipe they would eat and sleep near
their job

   i wish i had told him not to start
them off until after hours this evening
muttered larry to jack as he watched
the procession wind dustily down the
canon behind its wagons  those sixty
men wont be ready for business until
to-morrow

   they couldnt well move their out-
fits after dark

   it might have been managed

  let me see said jack murdock
has twenty men still at work here on the
sluices then there are those twelve
machinery - iustallers from pittsburgh
ives is directing the work on the sluices
for you and jones and armsby are down
on the pipe

  well larry looked at him in
surprise he had yielded as far as he
felt that he safely could to the man who
was both his friend and his partner but
jacks insistence on protective measures
was beginning to make him uneasy

  well jack continued speculatively
 there are five of us - and we might
count on those twelve machinists in a
pinch

   jack youre getting melodramatic
laughed larry

  perhaps i am said jack any-
how im going for a ride murdock
kept madden at the corral here with a
few ponies didnt he

   yes

   well good luck to you then
larry im off for a time

  jack rode up the canon with an ex-
pectant heart as for the situation at
the camp there was little to do during
the next few days except to await de-
velopments murdock would not show
his hand yet and meantime here was
this wonderful norse goddess to wor-
ship he found that he craved to see
her again that he might the better re-
member her loveliness

  but when he reached the little bridge
from which he had first seen her the
afternoon before she was nowhere in
view the stream rushed over its rap-
ids and into its quiet pools and there
was no one to lure the wary trout from
their hiding-places jack looked in vain
for a glint of golden hair

  from the low houses that raised their
roofs here and there through the valley
the smoke rose as on yesterday from

some distant field came the rattle of a
mowing machine but near at hand
there was no sign of human life and
as he looked the scene became to him
strangely empty

  he almost wondered whether he had
not dreamed thekla-whether she were
not merely an ideal of his imagination
that had flowered in these fields to a
seeming but temporary reality

  for a moment he considered riding on
to the house and asking for her per-
haps after all she had suffered some ill
effects from her injury it would be the
polite the correct thing to go and in-
quire how she was

  but there was her fathers hostility to
the project in the canon perhaps it
would be extended to tack himself
thekla had not invited him into the
house when lie took her home there
had been no reason for her doing so
but now he fancied that she might have
feared an inhospitable reception for him

  as to the possibility that she had been
more seriously injured than she thought
he refused to entertain it her mere
failure to appear at the same time in the
same place where he had first seen her
was no evidence that she was ill

  sitting his pony there at die little
bridge he might have been a scout
scanning an untried country peter
wist or any of his fellow farmers
would think as much should they see
him and their suspicions of the bend-
water scheme would increase he real-
ized this it would be inadvisable for
him to remain where he was

  but first he must satisfy his fancy to
leave some token dismounting he
gathered a handful of roadside flowers
and carried them up the stream to the
place where he had found her

  he untied the silk handkerchief that
was about his throat and spreading it
flat laid the flowers upon it and weight-
ed them down with a flat stone upon
their stems then lie tore a blank leaf
from his memorandum-book and scrib-
bled upon it with his pencil

  	hope you are all right-t m 

  he thrust the paper under the flow-
ers she might again pass this way and
find his token

  when he got back to the road a child
the dam-builders



was standing near his pony - a flaxen-
haired snub-nosed little girl about
eight years old where she had come
from he could not at first imagine for
the road was straight all the way to
peter wists house and there had been
no one in sight when he dismounted

  hallo said jack

   the girl had thrust a finger into her
mouth and at the sound of his voice
she looked at him shyly

   do you understand english little
one 

  an embarrassed nod finger still in
mouth

  do you know miss wist - thekla
wist

  again the nod

   have you seen her to-day is she
well

  the girl nodded more vigorously

  whats your name little one

  she hung her head and her body
swayed with embarrassment but he
caught the word  christine  - hardly
more than a breath

   where were you playing when i
came 

  his smile was anything but ogreish
and the child pointed to the field at the
roadside she had lain hidden it ap-
peared amid the alfalfa

  well good-by christine he
climbed into the saddle and with a pro-
found salute went galloping away

  it was now that the whim struck him
not to return at once to the camp but
to ride by way of willow canon to lar-
kin city eat supper at a hotel and dur-
ing the evening go back to the dam
through bendwater canon

  it was a long ride-the eight miles
already covered from the dam to  swe-
den   nearly twenty miles from  swe-
den  to larkin city by willow canon
and eight miles up the bendwater to
the dam but the pony was in good
condition and if necessary he could
exchange it for a fresh mount at a stable
in larkin city

  a mile to his left he could see the
gap in the surrounding mountains that
marked the entrance to willow canon
the regular road thither began some-
where back in the settlement but he
continued toward the bendwater until he
had passed the limit of cultivated fields
 r r

and then turned in upon the sage-brush
slopes at his left skirting the shoulder
that divided the two canons

  his course took him high enough to
give him a better view of  sweden
and he was surprised to observe the ex-
tent of cultivated fields and the inge-
nious way in which the little streams
had been turned to irrigation purposes
at length he came down to the willow
canon road where it rose over the low
barrier that shut the head of the canon
off from sweden and giving the pony
the rein let the sure-footed animal
plunge forward at an easy lope

   willow canon was not so picturesque
as the bendwater its walls were rela-
tively low and its stream though aug-
mented as it proceeded by brooks from
the mountainsides was small he rode
many miles before he came to a house
for here there were no bottom-lands that
could be cultivated

  half-way down he met a wagon
coming up and halted his pony at a
widening of the narrow road to let it
pass the driver was a stolid scandi-
navian giant who nodded in indifferent
greeting but showed no surprise at see-
ing a stranger in this out-of-the-way
place one of the farmers of  swe-
den no doubt returning from larkin
city with supplies

   at last the canon broke through the
range and debouched upon the low table-
land or  bench which lay at the back
of larkin city

   looking to the right jack could see
where bendwater canon had its opening
-a mile away-and as he looked a horse-
man emerged and went galloping on to-
ward the city

   at that distance of course it was im-
 possible to make out who the rider was
 but there was every reason to think that
 it was somebody from the dam for the
 men of the outfit were virtually the only
 ones to go up and down the bendwater
  the construction-work had been in
 progress

   the two roads converged farther on
thus as jack proceeded the rider from
the bendwater was closer something
familiar in the way that rider sat in his
saddle led jack to slow down he
thought it wise not to be recognized un-
til he had himself recognized the other
-

the -railroad mans magazine

a screen of poplars which bordered the
road for a way helped him to keep fair-
ly well out of sight while at the same
time he could look through the trees and
across the fields to the other road

  the distant rider was not sparing his
horse jack meantime had slowed
down indeed he stopped altogether
just before he reached the end of the row
of poplars and waited

  the other man came nearer and near-
er on his angle and when he passed the
point nearest to jack he was not more
than a quarter of a mile away he sat
well back his neck thrust forward be-
tween his broad bent shoulders

  his long legs even with the stirrup-
straps let out as far as could be were
so bent that his knees almost came up to
the pommel of the saddle it was bill
murdock bent on an errand which ap-
peared to be hasty

  the presence of the contractor in
larkin city added to the interest of
jacks visit the natural supposition
was that murdock had ridden down on
business-and business that was not
necessarily important or significant he
might be planning to hire more men or
to arrange for a consignment of sup-
plies

  jack nevertheless determined to play
the detective such a course could do
no harm and he might learn something
therefore he ambled slowly into the
city by an indirect route and put his
ponv up at a stable which was not ordi-
narily patronized by the bendwater out-
fit

  larkin city was a type of those west-
ern communities which have lived
through the youthful period of danger-
ous overgrowth originally a placer
camp in the karamak valley the later
discovery of quartz ledges in the vicin-
ity had led to the establishment of
stamping-mills

  the mines were all in the mountains
to the west of the city for no pros-
pector had ever found color worth while
in bendwater and willow canons a
transcontinental railroad had forced its
way through the karamak valley-add-
ing to the permanent importance of
larkin city

  agriculture had taken hold wherever
the soil proved suitable and water could

be obtained so that larkin city now
had a population of about fifteen thou-
sand people two banks a good hotel
many saloons and a few churches

  jack strolled slowly down the main
street dusk was just coming on and
the arc-lamps were flashing out at the
corners whitening the wide macadam
road-bed and enfeebling the incandescent
bulbs that shone in the various shop-
windows

  many people were abroad most of
them lounging idly-laborers from the
stamping-mills farmers in from outlying
districts a sprinkling of better-dressed
citizens at the garish entrances of two
moving - picture shows phonographs
squawked loudly

  avoiding the hotel since murdock
would be likely to be there jack en-
tered a cheap restaurant and ate a hasty
meal on the street again he set out
to find murdock

  first he went to the hotel the con-
tractor was not in the lobby nor did
a glance into the cafe and the dining-
room reveal him jack looked into
three or four saloons without discovering
the man he sought

  he had about made up his mind that
murdocks errand had taken him to the
residence district - and very likely to
garths-when he saw the man strolling
along fifty feet ahead he checked his
own pace

  murdock glanced at his watch he
appeared to be in  great hurry his
manner was that of one who has a little
time to kill and he glanced into shop-
windows and once or twice nodded care-
lessly to passing acquaintances

  at last he turned in at the entrance
to one of the moving-picture shows
bought a ticket and disappeared through
the curtains jack promptly followed
into the stuffy little theater

  the dim light reflected from the pic-
tures on the screen enabled him to make
out murdocks big form seated several
rows forward he himself remained
standing at the back ready to get quick-
ly away if the contractor should show
signs of leaving

  the pictures projected  the screen
at the time jack entered were a varia-
tion on the familiar series illustrating the
attempts of a thief to escape from the
the dam-builders



police the pursuit began on foot and
the thief then took possession of a cab
the police following in a delivery-wagon
pursuers and pursued then impressed
motor-cars into service and the little
drama ended with a fight on a country
road the fugitive being killed by a re-
volver-shot

  the crowd greeted the pictures up-
roariously they applauded every suc-
cessful turn the fugitive made anil
cheered loudly during the fight they
were not jaded by amusements in lar-
kin city

   the next scene was the final round of
a battle between two well-known pugi-
lists this proved highly popular and
there were cries from the excited crowd of
good boy tommy and hit him
again jack	

   and then the preliminary white let-
ters flashed out on the screen

   local view-work on the bendwatej

   dam

   there it was-the long gray line of
masonry with the mountains rising at
each side and the derricks lifting the
heavy blocks of stone and swinging them
to place the workmen were moving
about or bending at their toil in the
foreground-though not near enough to
be recognized except by one familiar
with his attitude-stood bill murdock
looking on	

  jack was puzzled to determine when
these pictures had been taken he re-
membered no visit of -a moving-picture
camera to the camp he realized how-
ever that the apparatus might have been
brought up in a wagon at a time when
everybody was busy and perhaps no- 
body would have noticed it

   people often drove up to look at the
work it had come to be no noteworthy
sight if two or three buggies or carts
were drawn up by the road just below
the camp

  now there was a break in the film
the camera had been moved nearer or
else a telephotographic appliance had
been used only a section of the work
-at one of the sluices-was to be seen
and between it and the camera stood
murdock now as large as life

  into the picture suddenly walked
larry and behind him garth and then

 thomas briggs and jack himself the
 crowd shouted its recognition of garth

   standing there at the back of the
 theater jack gasped at the photographic
 presentment his own motions as pic-
 tured  the screen appeared both fa-
 miliar and strange

   he had not realized that his walk had
 such an effect of indolence but there
 was no strangeness to him in the manner
 of the other men the camera had un-
 doubtedly caught the group at the mo-
 ment when thomas briggs was being in-
 troduced to the work

   larry on the screen seemed to hail
 murdock for the big contractor sudden-
 ly turned toward the four men who
 were approaching him the expression
 of his face was distinct-the opening of
 the mouth when he recognized briggs
 the involuntary step forward and
 there was that swift look of warning on
 briggss face

   the introduction took place-just as
 he remembered it then something hap-
 pened which he had forgotten garth
 was pointing toward the dam and speak-
 ing to larry and he himself stepped
 forward

   briggs and murdock were now behind
 the others suddenly briggs stepped
 forward and put his mouth close to the
 contractors ear

   apparently he was whispering some-
 thing the contractor nodded assent
 and the two men moved apart

  another moment and the five men
 on the screen were all talking together
 again briggs took out his handkerchief
 and mopped his brow then jack saw
 himself stoop pick something up and
  slip it into his pocket

   what was it he had picked up oh
 yes-the broken shilling his eyes still
 on the pictures he quickly felt in his
 pocket

   the fragment of coin was still there

   the moving-pictures now shifted to
 the pipe-line but jack had seen enough
 he had seen briggs seize the moment
 when the backs of the others were
 turned to whisper to murdock

  he wondered how murdock had en-
 joyed the pictures looking to where
 murdock was sitting he observed that
 the contractor was stirring as if about
 to rise therefore he stepped quickly


the railroad mans magazine

 out to the open air and hurrying across
 the street took up a position in the half-
 concealment of a doorway

chapter v
room  i

presently murdock came slowly
out of the theater his eyes were
on the ground as though he had been
made thoughtful by what he had seen
he turned to the right and slouched
in the direction of the hotel

  jack followed on the other side of the
street he had begun to think that
the object of the contractors visit to the
city was to see the moving pictures the
news that they were being shown might
easily have spread to the camp

  when he got to the hotel however
murdock turned in at the main entrance
with a manner of definite purpose first
glancing toward the clock-tower of the
railroad station two blocks away the
hands on the illuminated dial registered
eight-thirty

  whether the time of the evening had
anything to do with the contractors
sudden alertness jack of course could
not tell he waited in a shadow at the
other side of the street to make certain
that his man had not merely stepped into
the hotel for a moment

  five minutes passed people were
frequently going in and out of the hotel
entrance but murdock was not among
them

  at last jack crossed the street arid
entered the lobby was a place where
the business men of larkin city fre-
quently went of evenings to meet not
only acquaintances from out of town
but each other it was to all intents
and purposes a club and if murdock
should see jack come in he would sus-
pect nothing unusual in the arrival since
this was the natural center of gravitation
for a young fellow of jacks standing

  murdock was not among the groups in
the lobby however nor was he in the
cafe either he had gone out by an-
other door or-and this became for the
moment a conviction-he was planning
to spend the night in the city and had
taken a room

the obvious course for tack was to

look at the register he strolled over
to the desk

   hallo mellish he said to the clerk
 what are you doing here this time of
the evening  

   wharton had a little business to
look after  - wharton was the night-
clerk- and i am staying on till he
comes hell be here in a few minutes
mellish laid his pen down with a flourish
of emphasis

  jack swung the register around as
his eyes fell on the names of the late
arrivals he exclaimed aloud

  whats the matter inquired mel-
lish

  nothing i thought of something
i have to do so long perhaps ill
see you later he hurried away from
the desk and out to the street he want-
ed to think fot on the last line of the
register written in a precise copper-
plate hand he had read

thomas briggs denver

  opposite the name was the room
number  

  there was little doubt now as to what
had become of murdock he was surely
closeted in room  with the denver
capitalist

  but jack wanted to make sure that
conference on the sixth floor must not
go on uninterrupted he walked twice
around the block trying to decide just
how to act and at last he made up his
mind that the simplest course was the
best

  returning to the hotel he looked in
and saw that mellish had been relieved
by wharton he walked in quickly
like a man late for an appointment

  hallo mr marley wharton
twisted at his heavy black mustache and
turned his body so that the diamond in
his necktie would flash to best advantage

  hallo said jack quickly has
thomas briggs arrived

  yes 

  good im afraid i-m a little late
dont bother to announce me ill go
right up and he was on his way to
the elevator before the clerk could ask
a question

  now wharton-knew as every man of
consequence in larkin city knew that
thomas briggs had some connection
the dam-builders



with the bendwater project it there-
fore never occurred to him to question
jacks right to go to the sixth floor un-
announced when the opportunity
came thomas briggs had reasons for
not enlightening him as to his mistake

  so jack was carried up to the sixth
floor and made his way through the long
corridors he would have liked to
stand outside the door of briggss room
to overhear as much as possible of the
conversation that was going on within
for he felt that in the circumstances
eavesdropping would lie justifiable but
as it happened a porter was sitting at
the other end of the same corridor

 as he stopped before the door the
end of a sentence came to him through
the open transom the clean-cut words
were in the voice of thomas briggs

  -simply must be managed

  jack waited as long as he dared
hoping to hear a reply but there was no
immediate answer and seeing that the
porter was watching him he knocked
sharply on the panel

  a chair was pushed back steps
crossed the room the door opened
thomas briggs stared out at the unex-
pected visitor

   how are you mr briggs jack
began affably  i happened to be in
town and saw your name on the register
the clerk let me come right up

  as he spoke he advanced into the
room oblivious of any frigidity in
briggss manner

   why hallo bill murdock  he ex-
claimed grinning at the embarrassed
contractor  and mr garth  

  his astonishment almost declared it-
self in his voice as he caught sight of
the larkin city partner garths wide
face was a picture of white dismay and
he tugged nervously at his bunch of
beard

  thomas briggs had the trait of show-
ing surprise only by silence thus he
was able quickly to adapt himself to un-
expected circumstances

   i am very glad to see you mr
marley he now said quietly  sit
down i was not sure until late this
afternoon that i should be able to stop
off here to-night then i sent a wire
to garth from the train asking him to
meet me here and suggesting that he get

word to mr smith and yourself if there
was time i go on to denver in the

morning

  the fluent explanation might or
might not be true

   garth could not reach you contin-
ued briggs  but he happened to run
across mr murdock and brought him
along

   lie number one said jack to him-
self

   murdock was just telling us
broke in garth huskily  that most of
his men have been concentrated on the
pipe a very good plan

    i didnt understand it at first said
murdock in a floundering attempt to
improve the situation  but i see now
that it is better to get the skilled work
done first then i can throw extra
men on the dam masonry if  have to
briggs disapproved of this line of ex-
planation he made his disapproval
plain by jerking a chair noisily away
from the wall and saying abruptly

   since mr smith is not here it
would be futile for us to talk about the
work he is the only one who really
understands it

   why not -come up to the camp now
mr briggs suggested jack well
rout larry out and have a night of talk
and we can get you back here in time to
catch your train in the morning

   i am too old for anything quite so
strenuous as that smiled briggs  be-
sides -his voice took on a graver tone
- since garth and murdock are here
i must use my time to discuss a project
i am undertaking in utah you see i
have many interests mr marley

   but i thought you wished to see all
of us

   i did-if it could be arranged with-
out too much difficulty but-

   well -jack arose- i wont stay
then

  he thrust his hand into his coat-pocket
and fingered the broken shilling if it
was a lucky piece he hoped that luck
went with the possession of it

   tell mr smith that i wish the work
all success said briggs

   lie number two-for sure  said
jack to himself

 i shall be happy to renew that mort-
gage continued briggs earnestly his


the railroad mans magazine

sharp nose seemed to hack the air as he
spoke  and even if the work should
not be done on time you need not worry
i am already sufficiently convinced that
you mean business - which of course
was my one reason for insisting on a
time-limit

  lie number three thought jack
it seemed to him that briggs was over-
playing the game suddenly it occurred
to him to strike a blow for the defense

   in that case he said coolly with a
smile that was not free from contempt
 youd better caution murdock to burn
no more blue-prints good night gen-
tlemen he stepped into the hall and
drew the door shut after him

  descending in the elevator jack
glowed with excitement he realized
that he must have left consternation be-
hind him and he could picture the as-
tonishment of garth and murdock and
the glittering anger of briggs

  they would wonder how much he
knew murdock would tell the story of
the charred piece of paper and briggs
would curse the stupidity of his ally

  but as jack thought the affair over
while he was walking slowly to the stable
where he had left ins pony he saw that
he had really done nothing to help larry
and himself he could prove nothing
against briggs and garth and murdock
in a court of law and he had simply
made plain to them the need of greater
caution

  not for an instant had he placed cre-
dence in briggss suave reassurances
the mere fact that the three men had
met together in that hotel room was evi-
dence enough that mischief was being
planned and the confusion of garth
and murdock when he entered had been
unmistakable

  now they would revise their conspir-
acy and make it more effective larry
and he were certainly up against it for
what could they do watchfulness
would protect them only until the time
when briggs was ready to drop his mask

  riding campward over the starlit
reaches of the road through the lower
canon he decided that the time had
come to lay the entire matter before lar-
ry worry or no worry the engineer
must not be permitted to continue in the
notion that there was no real reason for

suspecting kriggs some preparation
must be made to meet the final issue

  as the wearied pony brought him at
last to a point whence he could make out
dimly the outlines of the camp and the
serrated wall of the dam he shook his
fist at it and exclaimed

   we will succeed you will be done
on time 

chapter vi
the walking delegate

r i he next morning he drew larry
aside and told the story he be-
gan with briggss visit to the camp and
their first joint suspicions of the man
and he added his early memory of
briggs and what his stepfather had said

  then he took the charred piece of
blue-print from his poeket and de-
scribed how murdock had acted when
he saw it he concluded with an ac-
count of his adventures of the preceding
evening

  larry listened gravely  you have
clinched the case against them jack
he said at last  briggs intends to
freeze us out theres no doubt about
that now i thought - but it doesnt
matter what i thought weve got to
be ready for them

   i didnt more than half think you
would believe it even now

   didnt you  larry smiled  you
must remember jack that from the mo-
ment briggs appeared you had more
reason to suspect him than i had
that was as near as larry came to ma-
king reproaches

  youre right said jack but i
didnt want to worry you until i was
sure now then whats to be done 

   will you stay here on the job to-day
while i take a run down to the city

   of course 

   keep an eye on the general situa-
tion watch murdock hes back isnt

he 

    yes  he rode in early this morning

   i will see if i can make arrange-
ments with another contractor to rush
some men up if murdocks men should
lay oft

  how can you do that larry its
a ticklish matter to talk about
th e dam-builders



  yes but i can find out what we
want to know without giving much
away its all we can do just now any-
way you see briggs wont have mur-
-dock act until the time has almost ex-
pired trust him for that

   there will be a strike or something
like it at the last minute when it looks
as though we couldnt get help but
we will pull out somehow jack

   yes said jack  we will shake  
they clasped hands in a hearty grip
of confidence

  so it happened that jack did not ride
to  sweden  that day he stayed in
the close neighborhood of the drafting-
tent murdock avoided him

  in the early afternoon a decrepit
road-cart crawled up the road and a
short stocky man with prominent front
teeth climbed out and walked rapidly
down to the sluices where the men were
working jack watched him closely
and saw that he was talking earnestly to
the men who fioticeably slowed their
work to listen murdock did not ap-
pear to see the man

  jack walked down to the corral
where madden was giving the strangers
horse a feed of hay

   who is that fellow that just came
up  he asked

  the old irishman answered readily
enough  his names oneill

  what does he want

   hes the stone-masons delegate
he wants the boys to qrganize

  jack asked no more but hastened to-
ward the place where murdock stood
the contractor did not wait for a com-
plaint apparently catching sight of
the walking delegate for the first time
he took a few steps toward him and
bawled

   here you  get off the job you
cant talk to these men durin hours
aw whats it to you oneills
prominent teeth gleamed

  murdock halted and as jack came
up to him remarked in an undertone
 thats the way the unions bully us
if i kick that fellow off hell spoil me
on some city job when i have to use
union men

   do you mean to say youre proing to
let that fellow call your bluff   de-
manded jack

  what else can i do

  jack shrugged his shoulders then
strode toward the sluice oneill
he called  come here a minute

  the delegate did not budge  who
are you he sneered

   never mind who i am come
here jack smiled grimly giving his
command the suggestion of a dare and
oneill feeling himself challenged
came cautiously forward

   how much are they paying you for
this asked jack -in a low voice

   what you talking about  exclaimed
oneill

   i asked how much you were being
paid for making trouble here i
 paid  

   keep cool 

  oneill thrust his head forward
 thats the way your kind of men al-
ways sneers at honest working men 
he exclaimed bitterly

   honest working men youre no
honest working man  youre one of those
fellows who make honest working men
look like monkeys

   ill knock your block off in a min-
ute raged oneill

   hold on i asked how much you
were paid because i want to raise the
ante ill give you more than the other
fellows

   youre talkin through that wild
west hat of yours who are you any-
way

   im one of the owners of this prop-
erty jack paused and he add-
ed  my partner and i own just as
much of it as aaron garth do you
understand  

   no snarled oneill  i dont un-
derstand

   well are you ready to talk busi-
ness 

   what do you mean by talking busi-
ness 

  jack did a rapid problem in mental
arithmetic after putting his share into
the company there had remained to his
credit at his eastern bank a little more
than six thousand dollars a third of
that he had spent for various purposes
and the remaining four thousand was all
the free money he had in the world-or
was likely to have unless the dam was
finished  time he could not offer


the railroad mans magazine

it all and larry he knew had lew re-
sources

   well he said at last  i mean
say a couple of thousand

  oneill laughed  i guess there
aint any business for you and me to
talk he jeered

   perhaps  can make it more

    cut it out 

  oneill moved away and jack real-
ized that he must have struck far below
the sum promised by briggs and garth
the knowledge of his helplessness made
him angry

   then get off this property he
called after oneill  get off now or
ill put you off

  the delegate swung about  youll
put me off will you

  will you go quietly

  oneill laughed  i wont go till i
get good and ready he said

  jack glanced at murdock the big
contractor remained in his former posi-
tion watching the little drama with a
non-committal air the men at the sluice
had stopped work entirely apparently
they were getting great enjoyment out
of the situation

  oneill looked ugly his upper lip
was drawn up and his teeth were more
prominent than ever apparently he
felt at home in the prospect of a rough-
and-tumble fight he was shorter than
jack but heavier

  nevertheless jack was committed
he felt vaguely that he was making a
mistake in taking the aggressive but
there seemed to be nothing else to do
walking slowly to oneill he said

   come now i dont want any trou-
ble but you have no right on this work
murdock has told you to go and i have
told you to go

  oneill did not answer jack still
smiling that grim smile laid his right
hand on the delegates shoulder he did
this with full knowledge of what was
likely to follow

  at once oneill made a vicious
swing with his right jack leaped back
and the blow missed him the force of
the swing being so great that oneill
spun around and almost lost his balance
his failure enraged him he lost all
his prudence and just as jack had hoped
he would rushed forward

  he struck out first with his left and
immediately afterward with his right
perhaps he hardly expected the blows
to land his intention must have been
to get to close quarters where he could
rough it with his extra weight

  jack warded off the two blows he
had expected them almost at the same
instant he swung his left foot so that
it struck the inside of oneills advan-
cing left leg a little below the knee
the result was astounding oneill
plunged heavily to the ground striking
on his right side his cheek plowed into
the soil

  jack stepped aside he had struck
no blow with his fists and the kick had
been so quick that its connection with
the fellows tumble might easily have
passed unnoticed by the onlookers

  even if they had observed it they
might think that he had lost his balance
parrying oneills right-arm blow and
had swung his foot around to save him-
self from falling he did not wish to
seem even to defend himself aggressive-
ly against the delegate and he was glad
to see that the faces of murdock and
the workmen at the sluice showed merely
surprise

  oneill slowly rolled over on his back
and stared at jack in a daze he was
bruised and shaken

   i dont often boast said jack in a
low voice but im going to tell you
something oneill i boxed ten rounds
once with a middleweight champion
and-well he didnt put me away

  if you want any more trouble just
come at me again youll go down and
out next time if you dont want more
trouble clear out

  oneill was sitting up  i dont
want any more he said sullenly
 there are better ways of fixing you
 thank you replied jack  my
friends shall hear about that threat if
anything happens to me theyll give you
whats coming to you

  oneill got to his feet and without
a look or a word walked away to the
corral two minutes later he was dri-
ving down the canon

  murdock spoke up abruptly  that
was a bad move he said  theres
sure to be trouble now

   not if you know your business re-
the dam-builders



plied jack then to the men at the
sluice  i call you to witness that that
fellow attacked me

   you laid your hand on him first
blurted murdock	 

   not in a way to hurt him and
you men i hope you understand that
there isnt any objection to the mans
coming and talking to you about organ-
izing so long as he doesnt bother you
while youre at work

   with that he went back to the draft-
ing-tent more than ever he was con-
cerned about murdocks attitude for it
was obvious that the contractor would
have let the delegate have his way-
even shaming himself weakly before his
own workmen rather than send the bully
about his business

  jack was troubled too by the con-
sciousness that larry with his knowl-
edge of labor organizers would have
handled the situation differently  would
not have permitted oneill to come to
the point of physical violence would
have found a way to put him in his
place by making him ridiculous but

when larry rode up from larkin city
and heard the story he had no word of
blame

   you did the natural thing he said
 but it isnt what you would have
done larry

  how about things in the city
asked jack then as larry hesitated
 dont be afraid to tell me 

   there isnt much to tell said
larry dejectedly  apparently not a
contractor will be able to supply us with
men for six weeks garth has got all
the stone-masons tied up building a new
stampintj-mill

   garth 

  larry nodded

   did you see him larry 

  oh no what was the use

   sure enough said jack  well
buck up  they havent downed us yet
larry lets go right ahead with the
work just as if nothing were wrong

   yes that is what we will do 
and remember this larry theres
always some way out if a man keeps
his eyes open to find it

              to be continued

not enough slack

a switchman and a brakeman were
once beating their way across the coun-
try both were without funds but the switch-
man had nerve and managed to feed both of
them however he finally became dissatis-
fied and told the brakeman he must make
an effort himself so the next house they
decided to hit the brakeman advanced
knocked on the door and asked the lady of
the house

   could jou give a poor man a bite -

   certainly said the lady and kicks a
bulldog out

  the brakeman started round the house
with the dog behind meanwhile the switch-
man stood outside the gate round came
pursued and pursuer

   open the gate  yells the brakeman
around they went again

   open the gate  cried the brake agent
but still the switchman stood

  why dont you open that gate panted
the discouraged man

   cant do it pal he said  youll have
to give me more slack if you want to make
a drop of that bulldog-ex

when does a journey begin

as to just when or at what point a trav-

	elers journey is considered as begun
is a question that has been put up to the
interstate commerce commission to settle
says the railway and engineering maga-
zine it is asserted for some lines that as
soon as a travelers ticket has been punched
at the gate entrance to the train-house pre-

paratory to boarding a train lie is actually
on his way although he may change his
mind and not proceed farther they refuse
to assent to a redemption of his ticket an
administrative ruling by the commission is
expected and if this is not accepted as
final a formal hearing may follow to test
matters

   a year for ties

by richard maxwell w i n a n s 

the wooden tie on which the steel rail rests is one of the very important
factors of the right of way it gives a road-bed elasticity as well
as solidity and strange to say the wooden tie has proved superior
to the steel tie

    the tie problem is an all-important one with the railroads just now
more trees must be grown or there will be a serious slump there are
many people who own abandoned farms or waste stretches of land who will
learn something by reading this article

oak and particularly white oak is the preferred wood  but a great
many other varieties are used and some have
to be treated chemically

kuring the year  the
 railroads of the united
 states-steam and electric

  -purchased over -

  	cross-ties at an aver-
age of fifty cents a tie
making a total of over  for
this part of railway road-beds alone

  and the cost of ties is not diminish-
ing indeed it is increasing for
serviceable stability the wooden tie has
not been equaled-and it is frequently
reported that some day soon there may
be a famine as the supply of tie-pro-
ducing timber is slowly being exhausted

  james j hill the veteran builder of
the northwest and edward h harri-
man the little colossus of roads have
not overlooked the serious side of this
rumor they have even proposed plant-
ing both sides of their track with trees
of the tie-producing varieties-making a

parkway through which the trains would
pass of course this is a project of some
magnitude and expense and could only
be put into effect by men who build
roads not only for to-day but for ages
to come

  both are practical men and if they
carry out this scheme it will be in a
practical way to a practical end so the
thousands upon thousands of miles of
waste space beside their roads is to be
utilized to produce a supply of timber
for the future use of these roads it is
probable that they expect to see ties laid
that come from the trees growing along
their right of way

railroads that own forests

  so far only two or three of the rail-
roads of the united states have attempt-
ed to provide a future timber supply for




the railroad mans magazine

their roads the pennsylvania system
and the santa fe system are both man-
aging their timber lands in accordance
with the latest dictates of scientific for-
estry

  the pennsylvania system has a large
supply of standing timber which it
is gradually increasing through con-
stant annual plantings the santa
fe system is planting many thousands of
eucalyptus - trees in southern california
especially purchased for this purpose
the illinois central railway at one time
attempted the raising of hardy catalpa-
trees for cross-ties but was unsuccessful

  if the increase in the visible supply
of lumber was in proportion to the in-
creased demand there would be little
cause for any grave concern as to the
conservation of our forests however
the opposite condition exists the sup-
ply decreases and the demand increases
this is particularly true of the railroad
cross-tie and the timber of which it is
made

  over  a year for railroad
ties gives pause for thoughtful concern
suppose for instance that the consump-
tion of ties goes on doubling itself every
two years where would the material
come from to make them after a few
years 

  if the proportion of increase should
hold the number purchased by the steam
and electric roads this year would amount
to  in  they would use
 and by  there probably
would be required the enormous total
of  ties to supply the de-
mand

increase in trackage

  according to poors manual the total
trackage in the united states on jan-
uary   amounted to  miles
the same authority shows the total
trackage for  to be  miles
an increase of over  miles of
trackage in three years and we are
still laying new rails and driving spikes
on newly constructed track

  from coast to coast electric lines both
suburban trolley and high-speed long-
distance lines are being built to an ex-
tent that was not dreamed of ten years
ago

there are many not directly inter-

ested in railroads who have looked far
enough into the future to see the neces-
sity of growing a supply of tie timber
for future use it is learned that maude
adams the actress who has a sense of
business foresight as well as the ability
to act purchased some years ago a tract
of land on long island which she plant-
ed to spruce

  this she said would be her drawing
bank - account for old age she could
hardly have selected a better investment
-an investment that without further
care or worry on her part would go on
piling up principal as well as interest
for years to come

looking to the future

  it is learnedv also that many other in-
dividuals both east and west have
planted available tracts by making an-
nual plantings these tracts of land will
yield a constant source of income of very
substantial proportions for many genera-
tions to come the advantage of this
tree-growing is that once the land is set
to the trees it requires very little atten-
tion until time to cut and market the
timber

  if fifteen hundred trees are set per
acre a small tract of say two hundred
acres will carry  trees in fif-
teen or twenty years according to variety
and size this acreage should cut three
or more ties to the tree or at least -

	ties and these if sold at the average
price of fifty cents per tie the present
rate would put about  on the
credit side of the owners bank-account

  since land may be utilized for this
purpose that would be of little value for
cultivated crops the original investment
would be of small moment the cost of
the plantings could be reduced to a min-
imum by the grower raising his own seed-
lings

	the banner year

  during  the railroads purchased
 cross-ties the greatest con-
sumption of ties ever recorded these
cost the railroads at the point of pur-
chase the neat sum of  or
an average of fifty cents per tie the
falling off in s is accounted for by
 a year for ties

the general business depression that af-
fected every line of industry

  there is a wide range of woods used
for cross-ties there being listed separate-
ly fifteen classes or species the oaks
are at present and always have been by
far the most important for  the
oak ties amounted to more than -

	or forty-three per cent of the total
quantity purchased the reports show
that next to these ranked the southern
yellow pines with  or nine-
teen per cent of the total in some pre-
vious years the per cent of oaks has
ranged close to fifty per cent and the
pines to twenty-five per cent

oak and pine most used

  however the oaks and pines furnished
nearly three-fourths of all the ties
bought by the railroad companies in

	cedar and chestnut supplied
more than  ties each with
douglas fir trailing very close to that
number about  tamarack ties
were used nearly  of cypress
ties and in round numbers 
each of western pine and hemlock
spruce beech gum lodge-pole pine
white pine and redwood and several
other woods were used in smaller quan-
tities

  this gives some idea of the range of
territory in which cross-tie timber may
be grown there being hardly a tree-
growing state in the union that is
not adapted to the growth of one or
more of the varieties

  while the reports show that the oaks
and particularly the white oaks have al-
ways been the preferred woods and still
form a large per cent of the total the
increasing price that the roads have to
-pay for satisfactory oak ties are forcing
them to look more and more for substi-
tutes

a variety of woods

  this accounts for the variety of woods
that are now being used white oak
untreated makes a tie which gives excel-
lent service for many years but it has
been found possible to take woods which
are not naturally durable give them a
treatment with either creosote or zinc-
chlorid to prevent decay and thus get



much longer service from them than can
be secured from untreated oak

  among the woods that have been most
largely treated so far are the yellow
pines particularly loblolly pine douglas
fir western pine and lodge-pole pine

  there are two kinds of woods listed
in this years statistics for use as ties
which previously had not been reported
in sufficient quantity to justify listing
them separately these are gum and
beech in s the purchase of gum ties
exceeded  while hardly more
than  of them had been reported
for any previous year of the beech
ties the purchase in  amounted to
nearly  against but little more
than  in 

  these woods are not suitable unless
given preservative treatment their in-
creased use therefore is one of the many
results of the progress of wood preserva-
tion in the united states for many
years beech has been one of the prin-
cipal woods used for ties in europe
where its value when given chemical
treatment was long ago recognized

  it is said that it is not uncommon for
european roads to secure from twenty
to thirty years service from beech ties
untreated they would be absolutely use-
less

more ties needed

  as far back as  at least a dozen
american roads were conducting experi-
ments in preservative treatment of ties
at present nearly twenty-five per cent
of the ties purchased are given one of
the several preservative treatments

  the hemlock and tamarack ties are
among the cheapest used being listed in
the government statistics at a cost of
thirty-three and thirty-six cents each
respectively the chicago and north-
western railway however estimates that
these ties including freight and labor
charges cost untreated when laid for
use west of the mississippi about sev-
enty-five cents apiece

  when treated with zinc-chlorid the
cost is about twelve cents per tie ma-
king the total cost of the treated tie
eighty-seven cents

  on the basis of an annual charge the
following comparative statistics are de-


the railroad mans magazine

rived-the basic data used estimates the
life of an untreated tie at five years
with an interest rate of four per cent

  being almost impervious to the pre-
servative fluid hemlock and tamarack
are the hardest and most expensive of
all woods to treat with the more po-
rous woods better results are obtained
and the life of the lie is increased in
proportion

  just at the present moment the great
problem is to get the ties to treat the
problem of a supply to meet the demand
-a demand that will naturally increase
with every year and that will advance
prices as the supply diminishes

  only one-fifth of our forest area is in
national or state forests and that four-
fifths is either in private hands or likely
to pass into private hands out of a

total of  acres of wooded
area the government owns but -
 acres with   acres in state
forests and the remaining  
acres are in private control or in unre-
served public forests

  it is claimed that the average age of
the trees that are being felled this year
is not less than one hundred and fifty
years the lumberman could not afford
to replace them even were he blessed with
the prospect of unequaled longevity

  in consequence there arises the need
that the state and national governments
which do not need to look for so high
a rate of interest as the private investor
and which are concerned with the pro-
motion of the genera welfare should
assume the responsibility of providing a
future supply of timber

hollands controlled railways

where the principle of government ownership is resulting in a
severe economic problem

if recent newspaper accounts can be relied
upon it would seem that the railroads of
holland are in danger of being legislated
or  controlled out of existence holland
according to these reports has carried the
principle of government control of railroads
to a great extreme at the same time without
accepting any responsibility in the way of
guarantees and without showing any desire
to take the logical step of government
ownership that its course in the long run
would render inevitable

  the government itself owns  miles of
line which is operated in two separate sys-
tems by two private companies the gov-
ernment has the fullest power of control
and proceeds on unlimited competition

  the companies cannot make any changes
in their schedules or tariffs without first re-
ceiving the permission of the minister of
railways the result is a congestion of un-
remunerative train service

  economies cannot be effected by mutual
agreement as this means of serving the
public and paying dividends is frowned upon
by the government department if it so de-
sires the government may take over the rail-
roads any time up to  by giving the
companies one years notice and  the
other hand the companies may insist on
government purchase if their dividends are

	more than three and one-half per cent
for two years in succession

  in  the dividend was clown to the
prescribed minimum and  was little
better therefore the administration find-
ing itself perilously close to being compelled
to take a step it wished to avoid has ap-
pointed a royal commission to investigate
tl situation and it is believed that its cast-
iro and uneconomical policy will be suf-
fick  ly revised to permit the companies to
pay ufficient dividend to keep them on their
fee even if tottering

describing an air-cooler for electric locomotives an automatic turn-
         table a new idea in the construction of dump-cars a
         decided improvement in car-fenders more switch and
         point inventions and a valuable contrivance for train-shed
         ventilation

to cool the motors

device for overcoming the tendency to heat
shown by electric locomotives
at high speed

one disadvantage incident to the use of
the electric locomotive lies in the fact
that the motors soon become overheated
under high speed a device to accomplish
this has been invented and patented no
 july   by max r hanna
of schenectady new york and lias been
adopted by the leading electric company in
the lnited states

  it consists of one or more fan-casings
which are mounted in the cab of the loco-
motive and are preferably driven from the
motors themselves leading from these
blower casings are conduits which conduct
the air blast generated therein to a point
beneath the locomotive where it is directed
upon the motors thus keeping them cool
during the entire lime of travel

  when it is considered that even a small
blowcr-fan will give quite a blast of air
under high speed it will be appreciated that
the device is entirely practicable

j

guard for switches

will replace a costly and uncertain design
with one that will last longer and
be cheaper to install

avery decided improvement in foot-
guards for railway switches and the
like is disclosed in a patent no s
august   issued to frederick w
rizer of chicago illinois as is well

known metallic castings are now employed
for this purpose and require to be bolted or
spiked in place and frequently renewed at
considerable expense

  mr rizer however has conceived the
idea of lilling in such spaces as are liable
to catch and hold the foot of a person with
concrete or some other material which may
be applied in a similar manner and will
harden when allowed to set such a filling
will of course pack beneath the heads or
treads of the rails and will not be liable to
become loosened this will also last for
almost an indefinite period without renewal
or attention of any sort at the time of
filling in the material a channel or groove
is formed in the surface for the flanges of
the car-wheels where necessary

for turning the table

an automatic device to render easier the
work of roundhouse and yard
men

the operation of the turntables now in
use is laborious to say the least and
frequently a comparatively large force of
men is required for this purpose it has
been proposed to employ some mechanical
motor suitable for the purpose of rotating
the tables but while in this instance ihe
necessity of several yardmen would be elimi-
nated considerable expense would be in-
volved in installing the motors and mechan-
ism incident to their use

  michael j leonard of long branch new
jersey has secured a patent no 
july   which discloses quite a new
idea in turntables and one which seems to
fill the bill in every particular in fact the




the railroad mans magazine

turntable invented by mr leonard is almost
entirely automatic in its action and requires
but a single attendant

  the table is so constructed that when the
locomotive is run upon it the pilot of the
locomotive engages with a trip interposed
in its path and by the pull exerted upon
this trip a weight which is located beneath
the turntable is pulled from one end of a
beam upon which it is mounted toward the
other end and past the axis or center of
the table

  this weight then acts to rotate the table
nt the proper speed until a brake is applied
by the attendant whereupon the engine is
free to move onto another track leaving the
table in its original condition for further
use

  means are provided for locking the table
at the proper points and are under the con-
trol also of the attendant

a simple dump-car

will relieve the strain from the weakest
part and put operation under
better control

in nearly every form of dumping-car
now in use the entire weight of the
load is sustained by the mechanism employed
for raising and lowering the dumping doors
and where such means include chains among
its other elements a weak link will fre-
quently result in premature discharge of
the load and possibly a derailment where
such is not the case on the other hand
means such as latches are employed but it
is necessary for the train crew to operate
them manually and this requires considera-
ble time

  to overcome these disadvantages and at
the same time to provide means which will
act automatically to lock the doors when
swung up to closed position harvey allen
of pittsburgh pennsylvania has in a device
covered by patent no  july  
a combined dump-car door operating and
holding or supporting means

  the construction of the car disclosed in
the patent to mr allen is of the ordinary
type except that a shaft is mounted along
each side of the car near the bottom and
to each shaft are connected chains which
connect also with the doors which are to
be raised and lowered in the ordinary
form of car these chains connect directly
with the doors and other means is provided
for holding the doors in closed position but
in this device a hoop-shaped link is con-
nected to each door and to each chain

when the shafts are rotated to wind up

the chains and raise the doors to closed po-
sitions these hooked-shaped links are drawn
over the shafts and act as supporting hooks
for the doors so that the chains are relieved
of all strain

a fender that fends

following the course of the trucks it is as
effective on curves as on straight
track

it is very probable that as many if not
more persons are struck by street rail-
way cars while  curves as when on a
straight stretch of track when this oc-
curs the risk is even greater for the reason
that the present fenders are- fixed with re-
spect to the platforms of the cars and swing
out beyond the curve leaving a clear space
for one to fall beneath the wheels

  also persons are frequently struck by the
fenders as they swing out beyond the track
line with the object in view of remedy-
ing this defect of the present fenders henry
d gardy of philadelphia pennsylvania has
patented no  july   a con-
struction of fender which will turn with
the car trucks so as to at all times follow
the track

  this fender is of substantially the ordi-
nary construction except that it is swiveled
to turn upon the car platform and has con-
nections with the forward truck which act
to turn it when the car is rounding a curve
so as to follow the track and more nearly
the general line of travel of the car

  notwithstanding the fact that the fender
is so mounted it may be tripped as readily
as can the ordinary fender bv the motor-
man to drop upon the track

new point connection

device which overcomes a long-standing
difficulty and is of simple and
effective construction

it is a difficult matter to make adjust-
ments for wear of switch-points under
present conditions owing to the character
of the connection between the switch-point
and the switch-rod this connection being
such that either  adjustment is provided
for at all or only a very insecure one in
a patent no  july   issued
to phillip b blish of chicago and charles
m bruff of chicago heights illinois
there is disclosed a novel form of connec-
tion for switch-point and rod which will
recent railroad patents



not only allow for adjustment but will hold
the parts securely in set position

  in carrying out the invention a hole is
drilled in the swilch-rod and a box-like
sleeve is fitted over the rod and has its
upper and under surfaces roughened or
toothed these sides of the sleeve are also
slotted and a bolt is passed through the
slots and the opening in the rod and also
through the ends of a clip- which is fitted
over the sleeve and has toothedends bearing
upon the toothed surfaces of the sleeve

  when the bolt is tightened the sleeve will
be securely held upon the rod at the posi-
tion to which it is adjusted and as this
sleeve has connection with the switch-point
the point is also held at adjustment the
value of the device lies in the fact that
there is no possibility of the sleeve slipping
and the switch-point is therefore held posi-
tively in adjusted position upon the rod

 a motormans friend

improved vestibule window-cleaner for rid-
ding front glass of snow and ice
without exposing operator

considerable annoyance is caused
the motormen of street railway cars
during the winter months by the accumula-
tion of snow and ice  the windows of the
car platforms or vestibules and where time
cannot be spent in removing this snow and
ice at intervals the motorman is frequently
compelled in order to see ahead to open the
window and subject himself to the cold

  while a number of devices have been
patented for the purpose of removing this
accumulation without the necessity of open-
ing the window they have nearly all been
so complicated as to render them imprac-
ticable a very simple cheap and efficient
device for this purpose is however shown
in a patent no  august  
issued to s jones of finleyville pennsyl-
vania

  in carrying out the invention disclosed in
the patent a short sleeve is fixed in one
lower corner of the front window frame of
the car vestibule and a short shaft is mount-
ed to rock in this sleeve and carries at its
outer end an arm having secured thereto a
strip of felt or other suitable wiping ma-
terial

  normally this arm is held in raised posi-
tion beside the near side of the window-
frame and practically out of view but by-
turning the shaft slightly the arm may be
made to sweep across the window-pane re-
moving any snow or ice that may have col-
lected thereon a spring holds the arm

raised and as soon as the shaft is released
this spring returns the arm to its normal
posiiion and holds it there

governor trolley-pole

air cylinder which will control the pole
when wheel leaves the wire and will
be easy to keep in order

in mounting trolley-poles upon cars it is
usual to provide some sort of spring-
controlled means for preventing undue up-
ward movement of the trolley-pole or to
allow the pole to drop after it has swung
up after leaving the wire

  such means is of course provided to pre-
vent the pole coming in contact with the
overhead hangers for the trolley-wire a
very simple means for accomplishing this
result and one which will not require any
considerable expense to install is -disclosed
in a patent no  august  
issued to major d self -of bessemer
alabama

  mr self contemplates mounting upon the
roof of the car an air cylinder the piston
of which is connected directly to the trolley-
pole a pipe leads to this piston and in
the pipe is a valve which has its stem pro-
jecting into a slot in an arm hung also from
the pole

  as soon as the pole jumps the wire the
sudden upward movement of the arm opens
the valve and allows air to enter the cylin-
der thereby immediately lowering the pole
the usual rope connected with the pole is
then pirhed to further lower the pole where-
upon the valve will be closed and the wheel
may be replaced on the wire

also of train-sheds and other similar struc-
tures to which it is applied in the roof

     there was a gap in the trestle - but
     she got over it without much trouble

alf an hour before train
time i passed through the
gate and sat on a baggage-
truck near the iron fence
in the ninth and broad-
way streets station louis-
ville the train nearest me-eight elec-
tric-lighted palaces besides mail and
baggage-cars drawn by a -ton l and
n racer-was the one by which  should
depart

  i became aware of a small gray man
sauntering along by the big engine-a
grizzled stocky figure of a man with a
slight roll in his stride seemingly en-
grossed in his own thoughts he passed
along stopped examined her outlines
with an admiring eye patted her pon-
derous cylinder as one might pet a child
and stood listening to the purr of her
steam presently he noticed me and
strolled over to the truck

  aint she a beauty he queried
jerking his thumb in the direction of the
engine i assented and after a pause
to keep up conversation mentioned that
the weather was warm

   quite so he said  quite so but
it would be cool on a moving train
mighty fine to lean out of a cab and
watch her throw the right of way be-
hind her on a night like this mighty
fine 

  i remarked that he must have leaned
from a cab in his time and he nodded
with some pride

   yes he said  i wrestled the re-
verse-lever and eased the steam into the
cylinders on one of them for sixteen
years not a big girl like that one
though  there wasnt any like her in my
day- quit in  i come  down
here once in a while to hear the sputter



of an engine and to pat one on the side
sort of familiar but i havent been in
a cab or even aboard a train for twenty-
years i run a grocery-store he added
with an apologetic air as if it was an
occupation of small renown and to be
mentioned without enthusiasm

  he relapsed into silence and i
waited

   excuse me i said finally  but i
am waiting for you to tell me about it

  about what he asked

   well about-your most thrilling ex-
perience   i said

   never had many thrills he said
 used to have lots of hard work and
plenty of wrecks and very little pay but
thrills as you call them w didnt pay
much attention to i worked on the old
c o and s w a rickety old road in
those days but some better i under-
stand since the i c got it

   it was fierce then though track so
loose that after a rain we could squirt
water from under the ties into a dogs
eyes twenty feet away the coach win-
dows used to rattle and clatter and the
bell on the engine never stopped

   johnny westover who used to run
the accommodation from cecilia to
louisville and back went down to
charleston about the time they had the
earthquake and they said he woke up
when things began to dance and rattle
and said  muldraughs hill by gad-
frey  he thought he was on his old
run

   we used to get hot boxes regular
right by a big watermelon patch and
while wed stop to cool pete and sam
our two darky brakemen would go over
and get some big ripe ones

   we rarely ever got from one end of
the leap	of old  

the division to another without going	there that was built like a culvert -

in the ditch and for a gondola to	nothing above the stringers but ties and

jump off run a hundred yards or so on	rails not even a hand-rail

the ties and then jump back on again	 the ohio was backed up in the salt

at the first curve was so common that	chock-full and there wasnt any bridge

half the time we never knew it unless	in sight-just black lapping water old

a truck happened to turn sideways and	man morrison and me went down and

tear up the track  then wed find it out	set sticks to see how fast she was rising

for about twelve hours	and she was crawling pretty fast

  in the winter wed buck snow and	whatll we do said the old man

l pulled her wide open and she took it like a hunted deer

in the spring the ohio would get on
a rampage and wed get laid out by
floods

   one time we got into west point
about midnight and the river was out
in the bottoms there used to be an
old wooclen drawbridge across the salt

-we hadnt been home for forty-eight
hours and if we got hung up there we
might be out for two weeks more

    cross her if the bridge is there
i said and we all climbed on and i
let  walk out on that bridge mighty
slow and eyeful with the crew ready


the railroad mans magazine

to pile off if she dropped the bridge
was there all right four inches under
water and we got across

  old  there was a good old
engine she knew me just as well as
a horse or dog knows their masters and
she never went back on me not even the
last trip when i quit the road she
killed two engineers after i left her and
shes gone to the scrap-pile long ago but
she never did me a mean trick in all
those years

   how did i happen to quit yes
i know old-timers are not supposed to
ever quit but sometimes they do see
these gray hairs i reckon i got most
of them one night on that same old mul-
draughs hill

   you know how the old line winds
in and around that old knob and all
those old wooden trestles there used
to be nine of them trestles-some away
up in the air too-built on short curves
one had a reverse curve in the trestle
itself

   i was pulling a local freight that
year and we had quite a bit of business
along the old chesapeake hauling dried
apples tobacco sorghum and such like
and we never had any schedule except
to start out on-we got back when we
could ben austin was running the
way car and the two darkies pete and
sam were braking

   i had a fireman named brady who
was young and enthusiastic when he
wasnt drunk and a hoodoo to the train
when he was according to the darkies
whenever brady came out loaded pete
would roll his eyes and say  mother
wreck this trip and shake his head

   that last trip was sure unlucky
brady was drunk two cars went into
the ditch down by big clifty we killed
a cow at east view and a gang-
plank broke at bethlehem and let a
barrel or something fall on austins leg
mashing him up considerable we were
anywhere from eight to ten hours late
when we hit the hill and i shut old 
off when we started down and sat back
contented like to let her roll easy

   it was about seven oclock of a sum-
mer evening quiet and peaceful the fire-
man standing in the gangway enjoying
the breeze everybody feeling comfort-
able except bob austin who was nurs-

ing his smashed leg back in the caboose
we had a pretty fair train twelve or
fifteen cars mostly loaded and we
pushed along about thirty-five miles an
hour snug and eozy

   down around the hill we bowled
over the trestles and around the rocky
points i was thinking about supper
and a smoke on my back porch at home
when we came out of a short curve in
a shallow cut and out onto one of those
hundred-foot high bridges and my
breath stopped

   about the middle the bridge was
burned in two

   it took me about a second to pull
a screech for brakes yell for brady to
jump throw the engine into the back
motion and give her steam but in that
second we were out on the trestle and
the valley looked a long ways below
the fireman jumped before we had
hardly left the embankment and wasnt
hurt the rest of the crew got off
austin with them some way before the
caboose got out of the cut

   as for me and  we were out
in the air behind us a loaded train
shoving too hard to be stopped before
us a gap in the trestle where for three
or four feet everything was gone but the
rails when i saw how it stood i got
up and threw her into the forward like
a maniac-i guess i was crazy

   then i gave her steam and we
jerked away from the train like a horse
when you cut it with the whip then
when we reached the gap i pulled her
wide open and she took it like a hunted
deer she shivered one instant settled
and sunk-then she rose and leaped sir
she leaped across and we went out on
the firm track beyond

   the rest of the train went through
the box cars dropping and crashing end
over end to the valley below and the
farmers used them for kindling wood
afterward

   i took my engine in and resigned
i havent been in a cab since i read
about these young lads with their twen-
tieth century limiteds and their racing
for the mail contracts and all that but
its too hard on the nerves

   i like to come down occasionally and
kind of snuggle up to an engine and
hear her breathe but thats all
what the hoboes cost yearly

a grim way in which the importance and scope of the tramp problem
may be brought home to the general public is in the perusal of the
analyzed accident reports of any large railroad it will be found
that the bad name that american roads have achieved in the matter of
casualties is very largely due to the tramp evil more  trespassers  are
killed or injured than any other class of railroad users-often more than all
the other classes put together

the harmful unnecessary tramp does many things to hinder the
countrys transportation and increase the cost

of living

hile the season for
the annual outing
of the underworld is
still with us it would
be well if its prey
the public could be
induced to bestow upon the subject a
passing thought or so lack of thought
has permitted a condition to develop in

the united states without a parallel else-
where a condition which has grown
steadily worse until it has become unbear-
able

  it is a condition of universal concern
for no community is too remote to escape
the visits of no one too influential to be
safe from none too humble to avoid the
imposts levied by the predatory hosts




the railroad mans magazine

of criminals which under the convenient
incognito of  tramps combine plunder
with pleasure on their summer prowl of
vicious indolence

  for some incomprehensible reason the
popular mind seems unable to disabuse
itself of the idea that the tramp is an
amiable harmless creature whose ex-
istence is to be regarded as a joke or at
the worst as a remote impersonal inflic-
tion like the tariff possibly this may
be ascribed in part to the comic supple-
ment of which the tramp is the favorite
hero and to persistent exploitation of
these vagrants in magazine articles

   possibly the facts herein set forth may
serve to show that so far from being
harmless tramps have become the most
insufferable plague that ever preyed upon
a supine people perhaps the truest ex-
planation of the easy indulgence with
which tramps are treated is the popular
belief that since they travel by beating
their way on railroads the matter is one
which concerns and must be remedied
by the railroads alone

  railroad managements might be par-
doned for sharing that belief for they
have been left to cope with the plague
of tramps without assistance from any-
body and least of all from those who are
paid to enforce the laws

encouraging a nuisance

  the theory that the railroads are in
duty bound to carry free of charge or
molestation every vagabond and criminal
who feels the need of a change of-scene
is even more firmly held in the country
than in the city the rural justice usu-
ally goes through the farce of imposing
a nominal fine upon the tramps brought
before him which is then suspended on
condition that the culprit take the next
train out of the town

  the chief of police of an ohio city
simply refuses to lock up tramps taken
to him by railroad police the governor
of an eastern state peculiarly afflicted
by tramps declines to commission rail-
road policemen as state detectives thus
rendering them liable to arrest for carry-
ing concealed weapons if they are found
to have a revolver in their possession
and the municipal police have not been
slow to take advantage of every oppor-

tunity in their power to humiliate rail-
road policemen

  thus sustained by public opinion in-
dorsed by official approval and backed
up by the strong arm of the law in the
principle that the railroad is the legiti-
mate runway of the underworld the
tramp has flourished until there is to-day
in the united states a floating army of
five hundred thousand criminal vagrants
and the number is rapidly increasing

the opposing force

  riding on trains intimidating often
assaulting and not infrequently murder-
ing trainmen are by no means the only
offenses of the tramps all the millions
of dollars worth of valuable goods re-
tailed in the stores of the land must
pass over the railroads before they reach
the consumer and these goods in tran-
sit are at the mercy of the tramps along
the line who are not slow to help them-
selves to what they want-and their
wants are not modest

  three years ago an average of three
hundred to four hundred cars a month
were robbed on a single- road entering
new york the value of the stolen mer-
chandise on this line footed up approxi-
mately half a million dollars a year

  so serious has the situation become
that every railroad in the land is obliged
to maintain a police force of its own
or a corps of special agents or some-
thing of the kind whatever be the
euphemism by which this force is desig-
nated on the pay-roll its use is to do po-
lice work guarding the track against
train-wreckers watching for car burglars
who steal valuable merchandise protect-
ing passengers from pickpockets at
crowded stations and on trains and from
sneak-thieves who take valuables cloth-
ing and baggage from sleeping-cars

  the railroad systems centering at new
york city alone are obliged to maintain
an army of two thousand policemen to
protect their property and that of their
patrons

  some idea of the difficulties encoun-
tered in discharging this responsibility
may be gathered from the following ex-
tract from the last annual report of the
chief of police of one of the trunk lines
as it was not expected by the writer that

   the train rider problem is one which question how long we can do so and ex-
calls for a radical change in
existing laws trunk line 
railroads have become the
popular routes of travel
for escaping criminals vegg-
men who are the most dan-
gerous class in the coun-
try to-day and a young
tough element who find they
can obtain free transporta-
tion from town to town in
this manner

   the fact that the penn-
sylvania railroad alone re-
ported having killed six
hundred and fifty-seven and
injured seven hundred and
ninety-one train riders dur-
ing the last year shows the
desperate character of this
class the fear of death or
injury does not deter them
from travel neither does the
fear of consequences prevent
them from killing any one
who interferes with them

the local courts will do
nothing with train riders
on account of the expense
their punishment would in-
volve  they simply pass them
along to the next town
where the same treatment is

given

   conditions at buffalo
and jersey city are bad and
are growing steadily worse

during the year fully a doz- he managed to escape after a long chase in which

en different officers have
been shot at in the dis-
charge of their duty by car burglars
in the buffalo yards alone at jersey-
city officers have been shot at repeatedly
by armed mobs of thieves which enter
the yards in daylight and shoot at officers
or whoever attempts to interfere with
them

   the leniency with which the courts
deal with these people when arrested is
responsible for this condition it is

fifteen shots were fired

pect them to do their duty and effectively
protect the property of the company

desperate remedies

this is pretty strong language but it
is far from telling the whole story of the
plague of tramps the plain truth is
that he situation became so desperate
last year that one of the trunk lines


the railroad mans magazine

was compelled to add a pack of blood-
hounds to its police force to protect the
lives of employees and patrons from train-
wreckers car burglars thieves highway-
men and other desperate  tramps

  another line was so hard pressed that
it was finally obliged to arm its police
force at buffalo with shotguns another
line quickly followed suit and now all
railroad police at buffalo are to be
armed with short-barrelled shotguns

  at short range a shotgun is more
likely to knock a man out yet is not so
apt to kill as a revolver besides it
affords more chances of a hit and a rail-
road policeman in the lonely wilderness
of tracks around buffalo needs all the
chances he can get

  captain weber of the new york cen-
tral police caught a notorious car thief
in the act of plundering a car of mer-
chandise in the buffalo yards last octo-
ber he slipped upon the thief and
clinched with him whereupon the thief
shot him twice in the chest

  by a miracle of good luck both bullets
struck at an angle that sent them plowing
around his ribs to come out of his back
instead of passing through his heart as
they were intended still holding on to
his prisoner the captain drew his own
revolver and shot the fellow in the eye

  captor and captive still locked in each
others arms went down and lay there
till help came the captains bullet
also failed to inflict a mortal wound so
both he and his prisoner recovered

a dangerous occupation

  this was not the end f the matter
however so emboldened have the tramps
who have made buffalo their temporary
headquarters become and so determined
are they to retain possession of a hunting-
ground which affords such rich plunder
that they visit summary vengeance on all
who attempt to interfere with them

  as soon as captain weber was re-
ported to have left the hospital and re-
turned to duty an ambush was prepared
for him one night in a lonely part
of the yards a lake shore policeman
who resembled him was shot and mor-
tally wounded

  the railroad police have many such
experiences for the tramp indeed does

not hesitate to kill any one who inter
feres with him officer wilson was shot
and killed while in the discharge of his
duty in the yards of the erie railroad
at bergen new jersey four years ago
five negro tramps who attempted to cap-
ture a freight-train at sparta illinois
last july shot and instantly killed a
deputy sheriff who came to the relief
of the tram crew

unscrupulous wreckers

  lieutenant william kane of the erie
police captured a giant negro in the act
of robbing a car at goshen one day last
summer while taking his prisoner to
jail the negro snatched the officers club
and knocked him down

  the negro then sprang upon kane
and began chewing his ear only pausing
to announce that he meant to kill him
as kanes right hand had been ampu-
tated at the wrist he was at something
of a disadvantage the coroners jury
which investigated the matter found that
the lieutenant was justified in shooting
the negro dead as he held him fiat on his
back biting and choking him

  several trains were wrecked by tramps
last year and a great many more at-
tempts were frustrated only by the vigi-
lance of the railroad police an erie
policeman saw a man bending over a
frog running up he found a pig of
iron wedged in the frog

  as a passenger-train was due in less
than five minutes the officer stopped to
remove the iron this gave the wrecker
a good start and he managed to escape
after a long chase in which fifteen shots
were fired in another attempt at wreck-
ing on the same road an unexpected
freight happened along ahead of the pas-
senger - train for which the obstruction
was intended preventing the accident

evencommit murder

  fifteen train robberies accompanied
by four murders were committed in the
united states last year by wandering
criminals known to the unsophisticated
public as  tramps no one will ever
know how many other robberies and
murders were committed by the same
class nor could any good purpose be
what the hoboes cost yearly



served by compiling a catalogue of such
crimes if such as have been mentioned
are not sufficient to show the tramp in
his true character any seeker after infor-
mation can get all he wants by applying
to any one who has ever been brought in
contact with tramps

  there is a popular impression that the
tramp is a downtrodden creature whom
misfortune has followed until it has de-
prived him of any inordinate appetite
for work but who is harmless and would
soon become an ornament to society if
he only had a chance nothing could
be further from the truth

  it may be true that occasionally some
honest hard-working man out of employ-
ment and out of money may undertake
to beat his way to another town in the
hope of finding a job but the moment
he takes to the box car or the truck he
becomes perforce the traveling com-
panion of the dregs of humanity for the
railroad is the ever-readv refuge the
safest retreat the surest means of escape
for criminals of every degree

wasted sympathy

  by the time your honest workman has
reached his destination he has lost his
taste for toil in a month like the rest
of the vagrants with whom he now trains
by choice he is not worth the powder it
would take to shoot him he is simply
a pest

  the railroad police must be conceded
to have some opportunities for gathering
first-hand impressions they made thir-
ty-five thousand arrests on four trunk
lines last year for offenses running the
whole gamut of the criminal code from
stealing rides to burglary train-wrecking
and murder they will tell you the
tramp is such from choice and that he is
in the profession to stay

  unless he has recently been robbed by
his fellow travelers the tramp usually
has his kit consisting of a pocket-mirror
razor soap needle and thread and other
trinkets of that sort thus showing that
he is out for the season he also has a
weapon perhaps a murderous bludgeon
made out of two feet of wire cable load-
ed with lead and wrapped with gummed
cloth such as is used by electricians per-
haps brass knuckles or a knife or more

likely a revolver which may be taken as
an indication that he is not out for the
good of society

criminals by instinct

  wherever they may be found gangs
of tramps may safely be set down as
criminals a pertinent illustration of
this fact may be found in an incident in
the work of special agent j m bing-
ham of the chesapeake and ohio rail-
road

  hearing that a gang of thirteen tramps
was camped at olive hill kentucky
bingham boarded a freight-train to visit
them after the custom of their kind
the tramps kept on the move so that
bingham had a long chase

  one night while riding a freight-
train the surest way to find the men he
wanted bingham saw a camp-fire near
the track at lewis west virginia
summoning some tool-car men to help
him bingham surrounded and surprised
the camp

  in due time the entire gang was land-
ed in cattlesberg kentucky but there
was no evidence against them as they
could only be held four days without
some sort of definite charge being made
against thefti bingham was obliged to
move his prisoners to another jail while
he kept up his search for evidence

  being still unsuccessful when the sec-
ond period of four days was up there
was another move to a new jail and
another after the fourth move super-
intendent bowden sent for -the special
agent

  after glowering at the officer a mo-
ment the superintendent inquired

   mr bingham are you running a
hobo excursion

   you bet i am i am running an
excursion to the penitentiary and i
think there will be just about one more
side trip between here and our destina-
tion

  he was right for before the time limit
at the next jail was up evidence had
been found that his prisoners had robbed
some cars at ashland junction then
one of the gang turned states evidence
told the whole story and confessed that
he and his companions constituted the
notorious  lake shore gang  of car


the railroad mans magazine

thieves thugs and all-around despera-
does the excursion ended with a sen-
tence of seven years in the penitentiary
for all the gang except the one who
turned states evidence

  the situation being such as has just

always has his kit consisting of pocket mirror
razor and other trinkets

been indicated the question naturally
arises what are we going to do about it
the question is of some moment for the
plague of tramps now costs the railroads
twenty-five million dollars a year

  let it not be forgotten that even a
railroad company cannot pay out what
it does not take in that twenty-five

million dollars does not come from an
inexhaustible reserve fund in the coffers
of the morgans harrimans and rocke-
fellers but is added to the freight bills
of all the merchants in the land who
simply tack it onto the prices of their
wares as they hand them over
the counters to the public

   in the last analysis the cost
of the crimes and depreda-
tions of vagrant banditti is
borne by the people of the
united states just as all other
 charges are it may also be
well to remember that it is
a per capita tax for freight
tariffs are based on weight
and plain john smith of
jonesville eats just as many
pounds of steak and potatoes
as a pittsburgh millionaire

  if one may believe what
one reads henry viii hit
upon the most effective reme-
dy for vagrant criminals re-
corded in history he simply
had a thousand or so of the
worst of them hanged out of
hand lesser offenders of
this sort were flogged and sent
home

   if the neglected to obtain
a certificate signed by two
justices to prove that they had
had their whipping they were
liable to be given another by
the first officer they met on
the road no doubt such
methods would be quite as
effective in the twentieth cen-
tury but doubtless they would
be considered too radical for
this soft-hearted age

  perhaps the next best
course would be to turn the
whole tramp problem over
unreservedly to the rail-
roads since the railroads
are expected to furnish their
own police force to protect the property
and lives of the public while in transit
why not compel them also to maintain
their own courts penitentiaries gallows
and hangmen

  surely such a course would be better
than the present system of requiring
them to arrest vagrants ard criminals
what the hoboes cost yearly



and then thwarting every effort to mete
out justice to them take for instance
the case of a new york centra track-
walker who caught a man in the act of
fastening fish-plates and other obstacles
on the track just before a passenger-
train was due

  the fellow was pursued immediately
caught and positively identified but
by methods only too familiar he secured
delay after delay until at last the track-
walker the principal witness against
him died and so he escaped punishment

  another example of many such cases
was the stealing of a quantity of silk
from a car on the erie railroad the
case was followed up so energetically by
the railroad police that the thieves were
captured and the silks found in the pos-
session of notorious receivers of stolen
goods the tramps who committed the

robbery were sent to prison but the re-
ceivers of the stolen goods have secured
one postponement after another and
there is no present indication that they
can ever be brought to trial to say noth-
ing of punishment

  possibly the best plan of all for deal-
ing with this evil would be to exercise a
little common sense if public officials
would but perform their sworn duty by
zealously and faithfully executing the
laws already on the statute-books if
they would sentence train riders to a
months labor on the rock pile instead of
sending them on to the next town or
giving them a rest-cure in a comfortable
jail and see that train wreckers car
burglars train robbers and the like were
promptly tried and relentlessly punished
the plague of tramps would disappear
like mist before an august sun

fresh air for the hudson tubes

how the engineers solved a difficult problem in the new tunnels
connecting new york and new jersey

the two submarine tubes under the hud-
son river connecting the new termi-
nal station of the hudson and manhattan
railroad company at cortlandt and church
streets new york city with the pennsyl-
vania railroad station in jersey city new
jersey are now in full operation the
question of ventilation was simply solved

  experience in the operation of the up-
town tunnels of the hudson and manhattan
system says the electric railway journal
proved to the engineers that with trains
running in separate tubes which for the
most part pass through soil saturated at all
times with water there was little difficulty
in maintaining good natural ventilation in
both the tunnels and the stations and
furthermore that the temperature of the air
in the tunnels was uniformly cool

  fans have been provided in the terminal
station however to accelerate the move-
ment of air if it is found necessary and
suitable chambers have been provided in the
land tunnels on the jersey side so that ven-
tilating apparatus can be installed in that
section if found necessary

  the ventilation of the concourse and track
level of the terminal station is entirely in-
dependent of the general ventilating scheme
installed in the building for the offices on the

upper floors an intake tunnel has been
driven under the inbound jrain tunnel for
some distance toward the river

  air is drawn out of the inbound river tun-
nel through theseopenings and the intake
tunnel by two fans located in the basement
below the track level these fans have a
capacity each of  cubic feet of air a
minute they are one hundred and sixty
inches in diameter and are driven by direct-
connected motors they exhaust the foul
air drawn out of the tunnels into an uptake
flue which extends up to the level of the
roof of the building adjoining this ex-
haust flue is a fresh-air flue which also
passes down to the basement level and from
which air is drawn for cooling the trans-
formers and rotaries in the substation

  no air is drawn from this flue directly
into the terminal station at the north end
of two of the platforms of the station there
have been installed motor-driven fans each
with a capacity of fifteen thousand feet of
air per minute these fans draw air out of
the station and discharge it through suitable
passages into the outbound tunnel some dis-
tance beyond the station with the aid of
these four fans it is believed that the piston
action of the trains in the two tubes will be
ample to maintain satisfactory circulation

 brain teasers

    here are three hard nuts to crack boys and
    perhaps you can send us some that
    are equally as good

                n answer to our request for puzzles two of our friends
          ralbfl have sent us the following

                        mr charles j bills of dubois pennsylvania asks
                 conductor jim says to conductor bill hello bill
                  a heavy string of one hundred cars youve got

                         no says bill  i have not got a hundred but if
         the number were doubled plus one-half of the number plus one-
         fourth of the number and the caboose thrown in i would have a
         hundred therefore how many cars have i in the string

             here is another one of mr billss perplexers

             conductor z comes in with a string of cars which are to be dis-
         tributed  switches at the division point if lie puts a car on each
         track there will be one car remaining but if lie puts two on each track
         there will be an extra track how many cars and how many tracks
         are there

             also we are indebted to mr j r conway of alberta canada
         for the following

             an engine and caboose west bound meets an engine and caboose
         east bound the only means they have of passing is by a turntable
         which holds but two ie one engine and caboose or two engines
         or two cabooses they pass and proceed with their engines headed
         right and cabooses behind how do they do it

             tf il takes passenger train no i seven days to go from new york
         to san francisco and no  the same from san francisco to new
         york no  as it leaves new york meets a no  there and when it
         reaches san francisco meets a no  just about to leave how many

           paget enters a very convenient apartment and
           drives to a convenient storage warehouse

synopsis of previous chapters

stephen paget a retired newspaper man and his friend marshfield are at-
tracted by the sight of a beautiful girl in a poor building opposite pagets apartment
a few minutes later a middle-aged woman in the street below is heard to scream
hysterically and on paget rushing down to find out the reason she says she has seen
the evil one indicating as the place the room in which the two men have just seen the girl
paget escorts the woman to her store in the basement of the cheap house where he learns
that her name is rosa and that she and the girl maria bigontina live in the room above
some days later paget finds the girl in a park homeless rosa has disappeared and
marias brother is also lost paget arranges for her to stay at the walton until her
people can be found he goes to interview the landlord who has turned her out and
in her room has an adventure with several italian cutthroats dining with maria he
is warned by a hungarian orchestra leader not to take the first cab or walk when going
home

    the cab they do take breaks down and in the confusion they are actually led into
taking the first cab the driver tries to abduct them but paget thrashes him and after
seeing maria to the walton he changes coats with the driver and goes to the place the
latter was instructed to drive them to he sees his enemy but fails to learn anything
next morning with maria he dodges the spies and carries the girl to the seclusion of
his cousins home

    as paget is going home he is met by marshfield who insists that he go to his house
to dinner a scheme is on foot through which the elder marshfield may purchase valu-
able mining property in abyssinia and it is practically settled that paget and young
marshfield shall go to look things over paget sees one of the guests at the dinner in
conversation with one of the italians of his previous adventure and later he and marsh-
field overhear a conference of the cutthroats in which it is planned to get possession of
maria

people meet to-night down-stairs in the
annex

  marshfield did not start he did not
even look at me only his eyes narrowed
as he gazed through the smoke from his
cigar at the leaderless orchestra huddled
in confusion on their platform

  wheres the annex he asked at
last

   i can gef to it all right i answered
very slowly davids head turned and
his eye left the orchestra to rest for a
moment on my face simultaneously
we rose from the table reaching for our
coats neither had spoken for there
was no need

the basement of the auvergne

     arshfield looked his
     unspoken question as i

              seated myself in front
              of him  its a gang
              of fiends i murmured

              a gang of-

   never mind all that interrupted
david  do you know what it means 
no i dont except i leaned for-
ward dropping my voice to a whisper
that was barely audible to the alert man
across the table  except that ghedina
is after our friend and that ghedinas


the railroad mans magazine

  leaving the section of the hotel given
over to the restaurant and cafe we made
our way down a corridor of the rambling
old structure to the office a stout
florid individual perched on a high stool
and lazily writing in an enormous ledger
raised his head as i stopped in front of
the desk

 good evening he grumbled rather
sulkily anything i can dofor you
 my friend and i were thinking of
taking rooms here-by the year said

i	 theyre cheaper in the annex
arent they  

   theyre cheaper retorted his
majesty from his wooden throne  but
that wont do you any good

   why not 

   because they arc all taken he
dipped his pen in the inkwell and went
on writing as though the conversation
was at an end for all time

   well some of them will be vacant by
and by wont they  i had been room-
hunting in earnest in new york in my
time and i was not to be so easily put
down

  perhaps how do i know com-
pelled to pay attention the stout indi-
vidual laid down his pen with an
aggrieved air and waited for my next
demand

  could we see some of them

   not now its eleven oclock how
would you like to have a fellow walk
into your room in the middle of the
night 

   thats so i smiled cheerfully back
in the face of the mans insolence  by
the way what do you do with the rooms
on the ground floor 

   theres only two of them that are
any good some kind of a club has
them in the daytime they come here
to lunch and then sit around and gas
down there

   and what do you do with them in
the evening 

   nothing the clerk reached for
his pen again  theyre no good-
dark holes were lucky enough to rent at
lunch time dont get anything for
them at that you dont want to hire
them

   we might like to see them sug-
gested david mildly

   it wouldnt do you any good be-

sides im too busy to show them to-
night ive got to finish this work and
get to sleep no use your wasting my
time as well as your own

   cheerful citizen remarked marsh-
field as we turned away  and what
now steve

   this i led the way down the
stairs to the bar and the lower obscure
regions of the hotel before us stretched
a dim corridor lined with painted hands
that pointed to barber-shops and tailor-
shops and heaven knows what other para-
sites of a prosperous hotel at the foot
of the stairs i halted for a second to
look back at marshfield

   well show ourselves i said  if
we get into trouble were drunk and
have lost our way do you understand
 i understand with a grim smile
marshfield jammed his hat on one side
of his head and twisted his white tie to
one side  its the best i can do on
what ive had go ahead

  treading silently over the tiled floor-
ing we had gone but a pace or two down
the corridor when a squat figure popped
out upon us from a side door

   hey hey  it cried waving its arms
in front of us  where you going
nothing this way

   thats what we want-nothing
marshfield reeled uncertainly forward to
be stopped roughly by the outspread arms
of the bootblack of the hotel auvergne
  ou in wrong-wrong-wrong
the american slang on foreign lips
was ludicrous enough but it was not of
that i thought with his last words the
boys voice had risen almost to a shriek
but it did-not drown a strange sound at
the end of the corridor-the sound of a
heavy door sliding shut marshfield
heard it too and fell away from the
human barrier that blocked us

  wheres the bar he muttered
thickly  we want a drink

   down that way

  the bootblack positively pushed him
along the corridor back whence we had
come in himself the boy was but a
feeble guard-either one of us could
have brushed him aside with one hand-
but we could not batter down an iron
door retreat was all that was left us

  well asked marshfield we
stood together in the quiet street looking
the spider

of palermo



 at each other in discomfiture  how
 about it 

    well spend the night here i re-
 plied with  sudden determination
  theres one more chance well get
 room forty if we can

   the florid clerk grunted in disgust
 when he heard my modest request
  hull yes you can have forty if you
 want it it aint much of a room why
 didnt you say that was what you were

-	after before 

   he slammed down the key on the desk
 and turned back to his writing

     if i was the proprietor of this place
 remarked marshfield in the elevator
  id fire that fellow hes not what
 youd call a business-getter

     id fire the bootblack and the starter
 and- and then i remembered that the
 elevator-boy was not deaf and subsided

   number forty was not much of a
 room the clerk might be rude but in
 that at least he spoke the truth the
 light  turned on as we shut the door
 disclosed a narrow cell-like apartment
 with two small beds a washstand and a
 window opening high up upon a court
 there was another window in the side
 wall for we were at the extreme end of
 the main building of the hotel au-
 vergne

   david glanced about him with a quick
 eye before he turned to me well
 he said again

    were at the end of the corridor
 next to the annex i explained  theres
 a fire-escape running down from that
 window

    oh said david and he sat down
 on the bed and proceeded to kick off his
 evening pumps  you dont want any
 noise in this game do you  he asked in
 answer to my look of surprise

    i wish i knew what i do want i
 replied  i am a long way beyond my
 depth i can tell you

    the only way to learn how to swim
 retorted marshfield as he stood up in his
 stockings  when are we going to touch
 bottom 

    meaning the down-stairs rooms in
 the annex

   as marshfield nodded i reached above
 me and turned off the light then stum-
 bling through the darkness to the win-
 dow i threw it open and leaned out

  do you see that fire-escape i
asked pointing to the slender thread of
iron which ran down into the blackness

  ahead of us we could distinguish the
roofs of several private houses fronting
on a broad avenue on our left was the
rear wall of the annex a floor or two
lower than the main building of the
hotel to the right enclosing the court
was an old stable and two or three di-
lapidated structures they were the
vanguard of the slums rubbing elbows
here with the wealth of new york as it
retreated northward

  where does it go david peered
over my shoulder striving to follow the
dim ladder

   to the roof of a passageway run-
ning from that stable to the basement of
the annex the main entrance to the
place is by a high stoop from the avenue
that brings it on a level with the office
floor of the hotel theres a way into
the annex from there of course but i
am pretty sure the door leading down-
stairs is locked at night anyway you can
bet it would be guarded just as the base-
ment corridor was

   of course what about the pas-
sage  david was following me atten-
tively as i whispered in his ear and his
breath came in quick gasps of excite-
ment

   its on the same level as those rooms
there must be a door between them i
think that stable is empty since the au-
vergne took over the annex theres the
bare chance we can get into the passage
by a window or somehow and then-

   i see muttered marshfield  come
on

  bareheaded without our overcoats
and noiseless in our stocking feet we
crept down the cold iron rungs a few
of the rooms we passed were lighted
but the occupants did not see the silent
shadows that dropped rapidly through
the shafts of light from their windows
into the darkness beneath the fire-
escape ended where i had hoped it would
and we stood on the flat roof of the cov-
ered passage

  where it joined the wall of the old
disused stable was an expanse of glass
the thick dust and cobwebs which
stretched across it visible even in the
faint light of far-off lamps before that


the railroad mans magazine

blessed passage bad been built it must
have been a window of the stable now
as we shoved and pushed upon it it
swung open pouring a shower of dirt
upon our heads lowering ourselve by
our hands we dropped silently into the
blackness and the secret of the stable

  and black it was the few rays which
straggled through the forced window
served only to emphasize the impenetra-
ble blank in which we found ourselves
every window must have been shuttered
and we could only guess from the un-
broken silence that the place was empty
not daring to strike a match we groped
for the entrance to the passage that we
knew must exist

  my hand was on what might have
been a door when i jerked it back to
clutch at marshfield from the outside
of the building came the sound of nailed
boots striking on stone more than one
pair was there and a trap like this was
no place in which to offer battle to-
gether we leaped far to one side falling
flat on our faces in the heart of the sur-
rounding night unless the visitors
brought a lantern with them it was pos-
sible that the two forms low on the floor
would escape attention

  a door was flung open and for a sec-
ond three men were silhouetted against
the dim background of an obscure alley
they closed the door behind them
tramped with the knowledge born of
familiarity through the darkness to where
i had been standing and then we heard
their heavy tread tiptoeing cautiously
down the passageway the midnight
reception was about to begin

  with the sound of their footsteps still
in our ears we rose to our feet and stole
after them guided by a spot of light at
the end of the passage it came from
the keyhole of what had been the back
door when the annex of the hotel au-
vergne was merely an unpretentious pri-
vate house at the sides of the door
rose two stone columns and between one
of them and the wall of the passage our
hands found for us a narrow hiding-
space into which we squeezed for a mo-
ments thought

  the house was an old one in its
long life it had passed through many
phases and one of its tenants had seen
fit for some purpose of his own to join

the stable to it by this passage why
he had done it we neither knew nor cared
but it occurred to me as  we huddled
close to the column that he had labored 
well for the schemers within

  apparently they had the control of a
part at least of the force of employees
of the auvergne thus the entrance
through the hotel was open to them and
closed to all others including busybodies
like ourselves the way by which the
three men had come was practically a
secret passage as secret as any under-
ground tunnel to a medieval fortress
and most important of all there was
no need for obvious and mysterious safe-
guards with which to attract the suspi-
cion of the curious	

  my respect for the intelligence of the
rascals had mounted as high as my won-
der at their motive when the door was
thrust partly open and a commanding
voice cried in italian

   that is better there is no need to
suffocate now giuseppe what is it
the gruff uneducated tongue of a
sicilian of the lower orders answered
him in a dialect i could with difficulty
understand for a  while indeed i
heard nothing but the harsh voice as it
plowed forward through its story muti-
lating the musical  italian shockingly
then as my ear grew accustomed to the
patois and to the words clipped short in
ignorant sloth i began to understand

   we found them sir the man was
saying  on a rafter close to the wall in a
little crevice as one might say when
we first looked we missed them but you
ordered us to stay until we found them
and we searched again

   you have taken long enough about
it came the sneering reply and i
gripped marshfields arm in excitement

it was the voice of the man who had
put me  the track of ghedina the man
whom i had seen lighting a cigarette as
he drove away from the marshfields

 hand them over he ordered crisply

   what  they  were we had no means
of knowing but presumably they were
handed over the conversation ended
and silence fell upon the room it was
broken by a sharp question from the man
we had left smiling and smoking in the
restaurant

   wheres the key 
the spider of palermo



  the key several voices echoed the
word in apparent astonishment

   yes the key ghedinas voice rose
high in anger  whats the good of
this stuff without it dont you under-
stand wheres the rest of it

   but signore that is all we found
there is no more

  a chair was pushed violently back and
ghedinas voice rang out no longer shrill
and excited but cold with menace and
command

   dont play with me where is the
rest no man lies to me twice

   signorl i swear-i swear it is all
i do not lie signore it is all except-
the gruff tones of the man who had
found  them  had turned into stam-
mering quaver of fright a palsy of
terror seemed to fall upon all who looked
upon the fresh suave face of my late
dinner companion

   except what 

   except the fellow seemed to hesi-
tate as though between the devil and the
deep sea  except a little book with fig-
ures in it that signor cagno took

   what  it was more a bellow of
rage than an articulated word which
burst from ghedinas lips  signor
cagno took it what did he do with
it

   signore so eloquent was the one
word that i could almost see the gesture
of humble deference with which the ter-
rified man disclaimed all knowledge of
signor cagnos doings

  is this true cagno apparently
ghedina possessed a wonderful ability to
lose and recover his temper at will for
now his words were fraught with the
same cold menace with which he had a
minute before addressed the working-
man

   i-i-there was a book but it was
nothing cagno stammered and recog-
nizing his voice  knew that cagno was
the name of my slender adversary of the
attic room over him too lay ghe-
dinas baleful inrtuencef for his voice
shook as he answered 

  nothing it will be something
when i tell the chief give it to me

   but i-it-i have lost it it was
stolen

  lost stolen you bungling fool 
once more rose the roar of wrath with
 r r

almost incredible intensity  dont
glare at me you had better be saying
your prayers stolen who stole it
 that busybody paget he stole it
from my pocket when he threw me down-
stairs nobody told me what it was
i kept it but  did not know ihe chief
will understand-he must understand
paget-

   paget  ghedina cut short the whi-
ning man with an exclamation of wonder
 paget i dined with a paget to-night
what has he to do with the bigontinas 
stuttering and confused cagno poured
forth a torrent of explanation and apol-
ogy- he had been ordered to search the
rooms he had found the black book
but he had been told to find papers the
book meant nothing to him

  paget-and the curse of the evil eye
upon him-had forced his way into the
rooms he had thrown him down-stairs
he had stolen his book he had run
away with maria bigontina cagno had
planned to get them both but the cabman
was a fool and a coward

  he had done all that man could do
ihe chief himself would have fared no
better and nobody had told him
about the book and he didnt know now
what it was

  he stopped and  gazed down the dark
passage-way a thousand wild surmises
rioting in my brain one thing i knew
the iittle black book over the loss of
which cagno trembled and ghedina
stormed lay where i had thrown it in
disgust on the top of my desk while
it remained in my possession no minute
of the day or night would be safe for
me  and yet it was a tool an invaluable
tool if  could only learn how to use it

   you did not know what it was and
you have lost it also you have lost
the girl ghedinas voice again broke
the protracted silence  it is a bad
business for you signor cagno the
chief does not like bunglers he is
angry already when he hears this he
will be furious what do you propose 
 we can get paget muttered the
cowed cagno  that will be easy we
can get him to-morrow-he is a careless
fool-and then we can find a way to
search his rooms

   a wise thought for one in your po-
sition ghedinas jeer cut like a keen


the railroad mans magazine

knife  that will give us the key to
these -he slapped his hand on the ta-
ble and i heard the rustle of papers-
 and it will lose the key to the signorina
bigontina the chief wants both-and
just between ourselves signor cagno he
will have both or you will pay for it
but what then asked cagno in
obvious despair

   i will talk with the chief he will
find a way until then watch this paget
and young david marshfield too they
are friends and see that nobody steals
the boy pietro pie is no good to us
now but we cannot let him go to tell his
story the chief must decide that also

   and hark you giuseppe or what-
ever your name is you have been to-night
where you have no business to be and
you have heard things not for the ears
of such as you if there is a leak we
shall know whom to blame we only
blame once my friend leave us
marshfield and i held our breath as
we forced ourselves back into our nar-
row hiding-place by the side of the stone
column the door swung wider open
and the three men we had seen come
through the stable stamped into the pas-
sageway as quietly as their clumsy
frames and heavy boots permitted

  they did not glance behind them-i
fancy the fear of ghedina lay heavy upon
them also and that they were glad to
escape the overladen atmosphere steal-
ing down the passageway the darkness
swallowed them and left us undetected

   if this business is to be left to the
chief said a man whom we had not
heard speak before  there is nothing
more for us to do the small affairs
can wait i am tired and thirsty let
us go to the cafe

  a general murmur of assent was lost
in the scraping of chairs on the uncar-
peted floor as the party within rose to
their feet

   just a minute i nearly forgot
ghedinas words brought instant silence
 this fellow who plays the violin and
sings here-get him at once-alive if
you can for i want to talk to him-but
get him it is important

   but interposed some one mildly
 what-

   get him interrupted ghedina
 surely you need no help in that he

has balked us on the other side for
heavens sake do you ever do anything
here in new york

  it was the last sneer that we heard
from him that night the heavy door
which had shut at the bookblacks shrill
warning creaked upon its hinges and the
members of the black conclave trooped
out into the corridor of the hotel au-
vergne marshfield and i were left
alone in the silence and the darkness

chapter xiii

i play the guide

y boy what do you want me to do
about it old marshfield
leaned back in his chair and surveyed
me calmly we were in his private
office high above the turmoil of wall
street and it was the morning after
david and i had been uninvited guests
at the meeting of ghedina and his
friends after their departure we had
waited for a while in the dark passage
before following them into the hotel cor-
ridor

  no one observed us and we made
our stay unostentatiously to number forty
in quest of our pumps when we returned
there was no sign of any of the partici-
pants in the conference apparently
they had sought elsewhere refreshment
after their labors now i had come to
lay what  knew before the banker and
to seek his advise

  i met with scant comfort puffing
at his eternal cigar marslifield senior
listened to my wild tale as he listened
to many mens stories no evidence of be-
lief or disbelief upon his face self-con-
tained inscrutable it was as though i
were appealing to the sphinx by the
time i had finished i had almost come
to doubt the truth of my own words

  what do you want me to do he
asked again as i stared blankly at him
across the broad flat top of the desk

   do but i want to know i stam-
mered

   i cant help you to know retorted
marshfield  people have to do that
for themselves in this world im a hard-
headed business man stephen and i
dont go in much for romance and senti-
ment-not in business hours anyway
the siider of palermo



   to tell you the truth i dont take
much stock in your story theres a lot
of funny business in new york i know
and you may have -run into some of it
but i dont see what  can do to help
you

   as for this ghedina chap what he
does with his private affairs i dont know
and i dont care he can help me in
this abyssinian deal i am told if he
doesnt do that he can go home and the
sooner the better and by the way ste-
phen theres been talk enough about this
abyssinia affair-just leave it alone for
a while will you

   leave it alone   the cold-blooded
invulnerable absorption of the man in
his own gains broke the spell and 
leaped to my feet in indignation
 leave it alone i tell you theres a
gang of ruffians plotting to steal a help-
less girl plotting murder plotting
heaven knows what and that you had
one of them to dinner at your own house
and all you say is not to talk about your
business affairs 

   and thats what i mean marsh-
fields heavy brows met across his fore-
head and his bulldog jaw set  im
not going to quarrel with you paget
youre a friend of davids and  like
you besides but by heaven you dont
dictate to me in my own office

   i ask people to dinner to please my-
self and im not going to waste my day
explaining why if you really want
help im home in the evenings usually
-not listening to fiddlers and fighting
cabmen im sorry to cut you short but
i have an appointment come up to-
night if you want to	

  as he ended he glanced at the small
clock on his desk the hands pointed
precisely to eleven oclock from the
doorway came the respectful voice of
his secretary

   mr rocca is outside sir

   show him in marshfield ordered
without another look at my angry and
amazed countenance

  the bulky figure of t italian
blocked the door as i turned to go a
sudden gleam flashed in the deep-set eyes
as they fell upon me but he extended
his hand cordially

   good morning mr paget we meet
again i see you have not forgotten

your engagement to luncheon with me
i trust i am looking forward to an
abyssinian talk

  it was childish enough but i was
smarting under marshfields rough treat-
ment and i grasped at any opening for
revenge however puerile

   there is no danger of my forgetting
mr rocco i am much interested in
abyssinia and now more than ever

  i have never been quite positive but
i have always believed that the sound
which came from behind my back was
the sound of a drawer in a mahogany
desk slammed violently shut by a man
in a very bad temper it was the little
things in life which most irritated mr
marshfield with a malicious mental
chuckle i stepped to one side to allow
rocca to pass but he did not move for-
ward at once toward the waiting mag-
nate

  if you are coming uptown mr
paget he remarked  let me take you
up i have a hansom waiting for me
and i shall detain mr marshfield only
a minute you may be hardened -to it
but  find your new york cars really
abominable

  considerably surprised i murmured
my thanks certainly this distinguished
foreigner was more than affable if he
were half as big as man as david ap-
peared to believe and his relations with
marshfield indicated if i did go to
italy and if he were as cordial at home
as he was abroad i would find myself
in clover those were a good many ifs
i thought as i sat down in the outer
office and picked up a newspaper but
it was well worth my while to wait

  my eye read the words but my mind
refused to listen to the news of the day
instead i fell to speculating on the real
character of the strange man who sat
at the big desk behind the closed door
and who was the father of a son so to-
tally unlike me i liked old marsh-
field-at least i had liked him up to
a few minutes ago

  in business i knew he was commonly
supposed to pound his way to the desired
goal as much by sheer overpowering
will as by any extraordinary commercial
genius but his business did not concern
me at home i had always found him
cordial and considerate in his peculiar


the railroad mans magazine

gruff way at bottom he was an affec-
tionate father and a kind friend

  even now still boiling at his sum-
mary dismissal of my tale i did not
doubt that he spoke the truth if i
chose to go to his house that evening
i would receive a very different greeting

  but i would not go i would find
my way to the heart of the labyrinth
without his aid there were enough
threads in my hand to guide me-the
black book which was the key to some-
thing though heaven knew what ghe-
dina cagno the musician the cabman
and above all maria bigontina i alone
knew where she was she must know
something and for the sake of her own
safety she would have to tell me what
she knew

  as i reached this comforting conclu-
sion rocca emerged from the magnates
lair though short the interview must
have been satisfactory for he beamed
more cordially than ever upon me as he
apologized for detaining me

   at last we are off he said as we
stepped across the pavement to the wait-
ing hansom  and on a sunny day like
this the open air is far preferable to that
underground atrocity you call the sub-
rway is it not so

  far preferable it was but with a cau-
tion born of recent experiences i glanced
upward at the driver he was a round-
faced irishman on whom i had never
laid eyes and i took my seat with a
secret blush at my suspicions was i
to go through life in terror of every
member of the innumerable host of cab-
drivers

  we had gone but a few blocks when
rocca poked with his stick at the trap
above him  i know fifth avenue
he called to the inquiring countenance
visible through the aperture  take
us some other way

   very good sir the trap closed and
we swung off to the west no profes-
sional guide ever worked harder than
i for the next fifteen minutes to gratify
the visitors insatiable curiosity rocca
asked questions about everything but
they were intelligent questions

  he had seen most of europe he de-
clared but of new york he was igno-
rant yet it was interesting-most inter-
esting and to him especially once he

had been commissioner of emigration
and he knew of the hundreds of thou-
sands of his countrymen who had found
here a new home ah yes every poor
italian dreamed of new york as the
gateway to the land of hope

  we were still hard at it asking and
answering as the cab rolled up sixth
avenue suddenly a new thought
flashed across the keen brain of the man
and he turned apologetically to me

    beg your pardon mr paget i had
forgotten that you may not wish to go
this way tell me where you are bound
and i will drop you there

   i was going to my rooms i an-
swered  but it is no matter they are
near by and i can walk

   ah but i insist it was stupid of
me not to have thought of it before
really i insist

  it was impossible to refuse and in
obedience to my order the driver turned
east again at the next corner as we
left the rear of the elevated trains and
the teeming life of the avenue behind us
i realized for the first time that this
comparatively quiet by-way was eleventh
street the next remark of roccas fell
on deaf ears for i was looking eagerly
along the stretch of stone pavement in
the unreasoning hope that chance would
allow me a glimpse of maria bigontina

  with a little start i leaned far for-
ward in the seat my head thrust out be-
yond the apron of the hansom in front
of the high stoop that led up to the
white door and the silver name-plate
two figures were standing as though to
enjoy for a minute the sunshine of early
spring before they entered the house
one was mrs noyes and the slender
girl by her side was maria bigontina

  the black dress and rather worn hat
had been replaced it is true by fresher
attire but there was  mistaking the
grace of the figure a smile flickered
over my face at the sight cousin lucy
had taken her new charge shopping

  rocca did not share my interest in
eleventh street he was leaning back
comfortably in the cab and mrs noyes
apparently saw only my familiar face
protruding from the hansom as we came
abreast of her

  oh stephen stop she cried rais-
ing her arm and the driver pulled up
the spider of palermo



abruptly without further orders  where
have you been all this time here weve
been getting all sorts of new things and
nobody to show our finery to except
ray husband and he wouldnt care if we
dressed ourselves in the drawing-room
rugs get out of that cab and pay
some attention to two lone women

  i threw open the doors of the hansom
and jumped out

   what do you want me to say cous-
in lucy something about painting the
lily and so forth i am sure miss bigon-
tina-

  i stopped as though the rest of the
sentence had been driven back into my
mouth by a clenched fist maria had
turned to welcome me with a suspicion
of ablush and a smile of genuine happi-
ness on her lips and in her eyes in a
second the smile was dead and the face
ghastly in its sudden whiteness one
wide glance she threw along the length
of the quiet street then turned and ran
up the steps to the door old jane held
hospitably open

  heavens stephen mrs noyes
gasped in consternation as the fleeing
girl vanished within the shelter of her
house what can have happened
she stood in the center of the side-
walk twisting about in the frantic at-
tempt to see in all directions at once
her own cheerful visage clouded with
anxiety and fear

  what can have happened she re-
peated  she was quite happy a minute
ago before she saw you

   im just the same i burst out  i
dont know what has happened-i dont
know anything about the confounded
business

   i must go to her said mrs noyes
with decision  she needs comfort
oh- for the first time she noticed
rocca within the cab  we have kept
your friend waiting come back when
you can stephen i want to talk to
you

chapter xiv

a wooing that began badly

t came back very soon parting from
signor rocca at the door of my
apartment-house with scant thanks for

his courtesy the italian it is true
hinted rather broadly that an invitation
to refresh himself in my rooms would be
acceptable but i was in no humorfor
the entertainment of distinguished vis-
itors

  maria hadjun from me as though i
had the plague my cousin had said that
she was quite happy before she saw me
for rocca and his amiable conversation
i cared nothing for the welfare of
maria bigontina i cared much and i
fancy that my feelings were quite ap-
parent at any rate rocca proved him-
self quicker to take a hint than i chose
to be with a polite reminder that he
would expect me to luncheon at half
after one he drove away and i was free
to return to eleventh street

  for marias welfare i have said that
i cared much it was of her welfare
that i told myself i was thinking as i
strode rapidly across washington square
it was true-i was thinking of her wel-
fare but i was thinking of something
else as well of the way she had fled
from me-fled as though i were some-
thing to be loathed no man is so hum-
ble that he relishes loathing by any one
but when it is the girl that-

  at the foot of fifth avenue i stopped
abruptly the white arch rose against
the clear sky children were romping
about the square the benches were lined
with toil-worn mothers the whole city
was reveling in the first days of spring
while i gazed blankly at nothing
numbed by the suddenness of the revela-
tion the last words of my unfinished
unspoken sentence danced before my
eyes and shut out the rest of the world

  the girl that i loved but i didnt
love her it was absurd i-iow could
a man love a girl he had talked to for
half an hour in his rooms and dined with
once love at first sight that sort
of thing came to an end with shake-
speare the futile sneer wilted in the
light that burst upon me absurd it
might be it was true nevertheless i
did love her

  with a long - drawn breath i threw
back my shoulders to face the new world
there was the arch there were the chil-
dren watched by their mothers spring
had come for them but for me there was
as yet only hope first i must win


the railroad mans magazine

maria for myself second i must hold
her against the world gaping on a cor-
ner would do neither and i strode on-
ward

  as i entered the door of my cousins
house the vision sank into nothingness
in the dim hall mrs noyes met me a
very different woman from the one who
had stood in the sunshine to laugh with
me a quarter of an hour before she
had no cheerful greeting for me now
but the look of relief on her face showed
more eloquently than words how eagerly
she had been awaiting my coming

   something terrible has happened
stephen she began at once  maria is
another girl she will tell me nothing
what can it all mean i am frightened
stephen

  where is she i demanded

   up-stairs in the library but do
you think you had better see her you
know it was from you that she ran so
wildly and-

   i know it was i interrupted
 thats why i am going to see her
weve got to find out what this means
i am-i mean you and -we are her
only friends cousin lucy and we must
stand by her

   of course we must retorted mrs
noyes with unusual heat but how
its no use your making melodramatic
speeches at me she runs away from
you and she wont talk to me what are
we going to do stephen

   i intend to find out at the bot-
tom of the stairs i turned for one low
warning  if i dont find out cousin
lucy dont let maria out of the house
and dont let any one in then i went
on into the library

  she was there huddled in a big arm-
chair staring out of a back window with
white strained face at the sight my
own face went white and my breath
came hard forgetful of everything
save the one truth that i loved her and
that she was helpless and suffering be-
fore mv eyes i took a step forward
maria i cried

  she sprang from the chair and faced
me her dark eyes blazing with inexplic-
able wrath

   you   she cried  you  
contempt scorn rage-all were in the
two words i stopped appalled at the

transformation mrs noyes had not
exaggerated this was not the maria
bigontina i knew this was not the
shrinking timid grateful girl i had left
in my cousins care the day before at
the detestable miracle i stood dumfound-
ed while her eyes flashed their full scorn
upon me

   you  she cried again  you dare
to come 

  had the long strain been too great
had collapse come with the relaxation
of security the hideous thought grew
irresistibly in my mind as the fixed eyes
burned through me and the face that
nature had made so delicate grew harder
and harder

  so for a moment we stood gazing at
each other then i took another step
forward

  miss bigontina what is this wont
you tell us

  though i spoke gently as one might
to a frightened child the mere sound of
my voice was like a whip to her the
slight frame quivered and she sprang
away from me behind the great chair
as though she would thrust it as a bar-
rier between us  there she stood her
eyes still fastened on me in undisguised
loathing and terror

  to me the situation was unbearable in
its hideousness

  what is it what have i done i
am the same man that i was yesterday
i am the one friend you have in the city
and you treat me as though i were the
lowest of the low

  unable to contain myself longer the
words poured forth in a torrent of bitter-
ness the vision i had seen by the side
of the arch of washington square rose
to mock me this was a pretty way for
a man to begin his wooing a fine ending
to my brief dream

  you my friend i should never
have recognized her voice in -those low
syllables that echoed the scorn in her
eyes  my friend is there no one to
trust in the world mrs noyes was so
kind so loving and yet you brought me
to her-you but i will not believe it
of her it is you have done it-you
you you it is you and you are vile
you are unspeakable 

  stunned by the onslaught i staggered
back as though from a blow of what
the spider of palermo



i was accused i had then no idea but
doubtless to the heated imagination of
the girl my confusion and dismay pre-
sented the very picture of detected guilt
of feelings i believe i had none-cer-
tainly none that can be described only
one who has come with love in his heart
to such a reception can conceive the
numbness which seized me as i saw and
heard

  gradually the same appalling thought
asserted itself-the girl was hysterical if
not actually demented but with it and
towering higher and higher above it
came blind anger born of grief and
pride my love might not be worth
much it was all that i had to offer and
it was not for maria bigontina or any-
one else to spurn it as an abomination
needless to say i did not stop to re-
member that of love i had as yet said
absolutely nothing to her

   and this is all you have to say to me
-that i am vile  when i spoke at
last i was as bitter as she  you are
not particular about your words miss
bigontina

   go  was all she answered her out-
stretched arm and white hand pointing
to the door in resolute command

  too choked with rage to speak i
turned away at the door i stopped
and with one last effort for self-com-
mand faced her

  of what you mean i have no idea
and when you have come to your senses
miss bigontina you will regret your be-
havior but i can tell you this now
whatever you fancy me to have done
mrs noyes has had no hand in it you
can stay here with safety- shall not
return to trouble you

  my words fell upon a girl turned to
stone

   go  she repeated and ordered
like a whipped cur from my cousins
library i walked down the stairs to mrs
noyes- she looked anxiously at me
but the thought of any discussion of the
scene was more than i could bear i
reached my hat from the rack and
jammed it on my head

  take care of her  muttered i
can do nothing then the white door
closed upon me and with wrath in my
heart i strode down the steps into the
world again

  mechanically i turned toward my
rooms and mechanically i stopped for
the second time that morning under the
shadow of the great arch it was there
that a few minutes before i had admitted
my love to myself i had not told it to
maria i never would the clead weight
of it all sank down upon me and crushed
the flame of my anger

   what did it matter what she had said to
me i loved her and i knew  always
would

  as i stood there slowly rallying from
the shock the familiar sights began once
more to convey their meaning to me
this was washington square and over
there in the center of that row of build-
ings was what  called home it was
all just as it had been and yet there was
a difference unconsciously i felt it
dazed by its grief my mind wandered
afield to seek an explanation for the
change

  the children had gone and only a
dilapidated horde of vagrants occupied
the benches which had been lined with
mothers it was dinner - time in an
hour they or a fresh lot would be back
and the square would be alive once more
the world was going on as though i had
never seen maria bigontina and i must
go on with it

  dinner- time  that meant luncheon
for me i had some sort of engagement
for luncheon i remembered it was
with rocca and at one-thirty if i
walked up i could do it comfortably
and i needed the walk

  i swung about and headed up the ave-
nue the mere physical exercise of walk-
ing toward some definite goal an infinite
relief but as i walked there was
more than mere physical relief a new
hope was born in my mind marshfield
had told me that ghedina could help
him in the abyssinian business and
rocca was the controlling genius of the
abyssinian business

  therefore rocca might know some-
thing about ghedina

  ghedina certainly knew cagno and
cagno had started the whole thing with
his men in rosas humble dwelling
also there was that black book on my
desk about which ghedina had raised
such a hubbub last night the key to
the whole mystery to marias wild scorn


the railroad mans magazine

must be within my grasp could it not
be in the luncheon in which  sought re-
lief from present pain

chapter xv

i am too highly honored

tt was an excellent luncheon so excel-
lent that marshfield commented on
it as we sat over its relics in the dining-
room of roccas apartment on thirtieth
street throughout the meal  had been
vaguely conscious of good cooking of a
noiseless individual in black who had
made of waiting a high art of unobtru-
sive luxury all about me of a steady
flow of conversation from my almost un-
known host which david appeared to
find entertaining

  all this i had perceived but i had per-
ceived it through the haze of my own
thoughts my mind was not on rocca
nor his talk of abyssinia nor the ele-
gance of his dwelling it was traveling
in endless fruitless repetition from my
own love to the inexplicable behavior of
maria bigontina and back again al-
ways in the center of my thoughts was
the slight figure of the girl tense with
white rage as she drove me from the
house to which i had taken her but
around it like the frame of -a picture
were the shifting memories of all that i
had seen and heard since rosa had
rushed screaming into the square

   could make nothing of them dazed
and appalled by the mornings shock the
clues i had fancied that i held slipped
from me as  strove to grasp them and
all the time the black-clothed man waited
noiselessly upon us david and rocca
talked and laughed and mechanically i
laughed and talked with them

   a very delightful luncheon mr
rocca marshfield pushed back his chair
and lighted the cigar the servant handed
him  i do not wonder you prefer this-
to a hotel

   ah i do not care for hotels and
some friends of mine were kind enough
to secure this for me rocca looked
about him carelessly  it does for a
time and it is convenient-very

  a singular emphasis on the last word
made me look up quickly i saw noth-
ing but our suave italian lfost smoking

placidly and i plunged back into the
dreary routine of my thoughts the voice
of my friend reaching me as though from
a great distance

   so convenient that i wonder you
have the energy to think of the wilds of
africa

   great heavens i am not going to
abyssinia  at the thought rocca
burst into a louder laugh than i had
ever heard from him  i leave that to
younger blood to you and mr paget i
am too old for adventure and the fare
of the mountains

   it might do you good davids eye
dwelt with disrespectful frankness upon
the surplus flesh of our host  anyhow
stephen and i are quite young enough
arent ave steve 

   eh-certainly-quite-of course

  i awoke from my abstraction to won-
der what the dickens possessed the whole
world to talk of nothing but abyssinia
and why david should be bent on drag-
ging me there i wouldnt stir from new
york until maria was safe-that was
flat afterward-abyssinia or china
or the north pole-it did not matter

   you have quite converted me into an
enthusiast though upon my word -
marshfield set down his coffee-cup and
surveyed rocca with cool appraisal-
 upon my word i dont know how you
have done it

  it was not a polite speech-in fact i
have always considered it distinctly rude
to my ears it conveyed clearly the im-
pression that david regarded his host
somewhat in the light of a confidence
man and was not averse to proclaiming
his opinion

  rocca was fully as intelligent a man
as i what  perceived he must have
also had he chosen but he did not
choose and in that instant my respect
for the distinguished foreigner crumbled
into nothingness

   truth works in mysterious ways he
laughed with no trace of resentment visi-
ble on his strong face and the talk drift-
ed into other channels

  suddenly rocca pulled out his watch
 if you really wanted to know how i
can convince you i would offer to show
you specimens of ore maps and all that
but such things are really rather a bore
i should be delighted to show them how-
the spider of palermo



ever ah i forgot you said you
were engaged this afternoon and they
are not here-it would take time to bring
you to them

   david rose from the table with a slight
frown

   thank you for reminding me he
said  i remember now that i am busy
this afternoon though i had forgotten
the engagement as well as you

  i knew the man too well to miss the
sarcasm in his voice moreover david
had said nothing to me of an engage-
ment he made no pretense of confi-
ding all his affairs to any one it is true
but had there been any reason for his
hurrying away from that luncheon it was
probable that he would have mentioned
it when the invitation was first accepted

  i saw the frown on his face heard the
sarcasm in his voice and i jumped to
the conclusion that he felt that he was
being asked to leave unlike rocca
david marshfield was never blind to
rudeness

  as a matter of course i rose also i
wanted to be alone to think and to plan
to my surprise rocca checked me with
his most affable smile

   sit down mr paget i am sorry
mr marshfield has to leave us- so abrupt-
ly but i know that he is a busy man
you have emancipated yourself from
business surely you can spare a stranger
an hour or two

  i sat down abruptly in the chair i had
just vacated who told rocca  had
emancipated myself from business and
what did it matter to him if i had this
individual took a deal of interest in an
unknown young man he had met only the
day before if another in whom i took
a deal of interest had shared his senti-
ments it would have been pleasanter

  well stephen are you coming
from the doorway david looked at me in
obvious surprise as i remained seated at
roccas table

    i think ill stay a little longer since
mr rocca is kind enough to ask me
there would be plenty of time to sit
in my lonely apartments thinking it
occurred to me suddenly that if the ital-
ian went out of his way to seek my so-
ciety he must have some reason besides
the charm of my society to me at that
moment there was only one reason in the

world and that was maria bigontina
therefore it must be on account of maria
bigontina that rocca asked me to stay

  naturally the processesof my bewil-
dered mind were hidden from david
for a minute he appeared to hesitate as
though he regretted his determination to
depart but rocca stood ready to bid
him farewell there was no excuse no
reason for him to change his mind

   as you please he said  i must
be off good-by mr rocca i shall
see you again

  he shook hands with the italian and
then the servant ushered him ceremo-
niously down the stairs to the street it
was all as it should be of course polite
perhaps a little formal but disguise it
as they might master and man between
them had managed to eject marshfield
as effectually as if they had kicked him
out of the house possibly rocca had
his own way of resenting unwelcome re-
marks

   it is a thousand pities your friend
had to leave us the italian dropped
back into his chair at the head of the ta-
ble  i should really have enjoyed
showing him- several things-the young
men of to-day are so skeptical mr
paget in my time abyssinia-

  abyssinia again the man had the
wretched place on the brain i wanted
no more lectures from the encyclopedia

   possibly he is not greatly interested
i interrupted  why should he be 
rocca leaned over and filled his liqueur
glass   a little benedictine mr
paget no why should he be inter-
ested in abyssinia you were present at
the dinner last night do you not think
most men are interested in great wealth
 apparently neither of the marshfields
is convinced that it means wealth i re-
turned

  at last the man seemed to be coming
to his point if he did it might throw
some light on ghedinas connection with
the affair and on ghedina himself and
that would throw light on maria and-
 was back in the midst of my dreary
circle before i knew it roccas mild
remark rescued me

   i have been trying to convince them
of that for some time ideas appear to
frighten them

  well my tone was hardly cor-


the railroad mans magazine

dial i did not care to hear this fellow
criticize the marshfields and also i had
discovered that the shorter one was with
the great man the more confidential he
became

   possibly you are more receptive

  the voice was silky in its smoothness
it hashed across me that i was about to
be offered a bribe he knew that i was
a friend of davids and somehow he had
learned that i had  emancipated my-
self  from business and presumably
from an income at the same time my
influence might be worth paving for

   what do you wish me to do i
asked running rapidly over in my mind
all the dramatic tales of incorruptible
virtue i had heard one man had light-

ed a cigar with a hundred-dollar bill-
that story had always rather appealed to
me unfortunately my cigar was al-
ready burning nicely

   i merely wish you to convince your-
self that abyssinia does mean wealth

   and how am i to do that 

   by driving with me to where i have
stored my specimens and my maps i
do not keep them here-there is no
proper safe will you come

  rocca rose and stood looking down at
me with the confident smile of one who
held earths treasures in his hands

   with pleasure but where are we
going 

 to my warehouse down-town-in
barent street if you know where that is

an engine for sharp curves

new mallet creation to be used in the logging camps of the
tennessee mountains

the baldwin locomotive works have
recently completed for the little river
railroad a mallet articulated locomotive
which is of special interest it is the first
engine of its wheel arrangement thus far
constructed by the builders says the rail-
way and engineering review and has been
designed to meet difficult operating conditions
this engine is in logging service in the ten-
nessee mountains on a line having grades of
two and a half per cent combined with un-
compensated curves of  feet radius

  the sharpest curves have a radius of 
feet and the track is standard gage with
rails weighing  and  pounds per yard
the design of a locomotive suitable for
handling trains of about  tons weight
under such circumstances requires special
treatment and the problem was given care-
ful consideration the --- wheel ar-
rangement was finally selected as offering
a minimum rigid wheel base ample flexi-
bility and a good weight distribution with
a sufficient amount on the driving wheels to
give the necessary adhesion the tractive
force exerted by this engine is  pounds

  i	its constructive details this locomotive
is similar to heavier engines of the articu-
lated type previously built at these works
the leading truck is center bearing and is
equalized with the front group of driving
wheels while the trailing truck which is

side bearing is equalized with the rear
group the rear frames are of cast steel
each frame being in one piece

  the front frames are also of cast steel
with double wrought iron front rails the
articulated connection is effected by two
radius bars and the weight on the two
groups of wheels are equalized by contact
between the frames  equalizing bolts be-
ing used in this design

  the high pressure cylinders are cast
separate from their saddle and from each
other while the low pressure cylinder cast-
ings are bolted together on the center line
of the engine walschaerts valve gear is
applied the design being in accordance with
the latest practise of the builders

  the front and back reverse shafts are
connected by a single reach rod placed on
the center line of the engine and having a
suitable joint at midlength this joint is
carried by a cross-head which is guided be-
tween the inner walls of the high-pressure
cylinder saddle the steam distribution is
controlled by balanced slide valves

  sand is delivered to the rear group of
driving wheels by a box placed over the
boiler and to the front group by two boxes
placed well down between the low-pressure
cylinders

  the tender carries  gallons of water
and  tons of coal it has a steel frame
on the editorial carpet

       gome boys gather around us back here

the december run

when we gave the courage club series
the highball some months ago the
idea was an experiment with us it proved
a very successful one and we feel sure
that many of our readers regretted the end
of the series last month but if you no-
tice we have always balm for the regrets
of our friends and when you read the open-
ing instalments of our new serial  the
daughter of the idol in this number you
will agree with us that we are in no danger
of letting the gage drop below its normal
position which is close to the shadow of the
blow-off point

  for a real steamer with classy lines and
a high draw-bar pull  the daughter of the
idol  is about as tine a bit of motive power
as we have turned out of this shop and her
designer mr john mack stone has reason
to be proud of her

  in the october number we promised you
the trail of the missed extra by j n
shreve for this month well we found we
had to cut that high-class car out and leave
her on a siding but she has been picked up
and is coming right along for the december
number when you read that story youll
be glad we saved it for you even if we did
it by accident

   the ten-thirty call  is a railroad story
dealing with the original methods of a very
bright call-boy we know that grown-up
railroad men give another name to the pre-
cocity of the call-boy but as we read the
story perched in the snug comfort of our
office-chair we had no fear of the impish-
ness of that tormentor of roadmen and we
laughed so will you laugh when you read
it even if you have just kicked the call-boy
down-stairs for suggesting that owing tq
the shortness of your wheel-base he has to
wake you half an hour before everybody
else

   mabel on a mountain  is another rail-
road story dealing delightfully with the
love-affairs of two operators mabel is
one of them the name of the other is not

mabel naturally but that does not prevent
them from owning one name in common
anyhow before the story gets through with
them

  another delightful feature of the decem-
ber number is a little story by clara morris
the famous actress called  christmas on
the rail miss morris has a large place in
a large heart for railroad men and you
will like her sketch

   in the matter of special articles we shall
again be  riding the rail from coast to
coast  with mr willets who has by now
taken us to california i lie golden slate
j e smith is still observing in the ca-
pacity of a country station-agent and his
observations are even more fruitful of
keen wise humor than ever may he live
long he is a real railroad man and we
are proud of him

  a new feature to be inaugurated in the
december number is a series of letters be-
tween an old railroad man and his son just
starting out in the business by herman da
costa mr da costa needs no introduction
to our readers-many of whom will remem-
ber his delicious bits of wit and humor in
the earlier numbers of the magazine this
time he is more serious but he is just as
pointed and as a railroad man writing about
railroad matters we have no fear for his
reputation

  the great trouble in writing this edi-
torial paragraph is the conflicting emotions
of the editor we must tell you something
about the running schedule but we havent
got room to tell you all and when we look-
over our fine equipment and consider that
we have to make a choice and show a seem-
ing favoritism where everything is so good
we are disturbed

  thus we are reduced to the expedient of
mentioning them as they come and while
the train is solid-vestibuled throughout we
can only mention the names of a few of the
leading cars the other cars are just as
good however and if you dont get aboard
youll be sorry for never in the history of
railroading was such a fine ride and such

    songs of the rail

we have many requests for songs this
month and if any reader can oblige
with one or more of the following
railroad ditties we shall be much obliged

c h p galiton pennsylvania asks if
anybody is familiar with a song entitled
 jim blake or the midnight express the
first verse of which begins

jim blake is an engine-driver

      he runs on the midnight express

another reader mr e f mckenzie asks
if we can obtain the words of the song
entitled poor tramps the chorus of
which goes something like this

it was just the other day on the n p
     railway

a poor tramp all tattered and torn

saw an empty box car standing still on the
      track

so he went in and closed the door

but he had not gone far in that empty box
      car

when a brakeman came round with a
     lamp

he was thrown from the train and was
     killed by the mail

because he was only a tramp

mr w m kensill wishes to know where
he can get an old railroad song by the name
of  mike odinner was a good engineer
it runs

mike odinner was a good engineer

he said to the fireman  dont you have any
      fear

all i want is lots of water and coal

and ill put my head out of the window
and watch the drivers roll

another song desired is one written on
the  chatsworth wreck  about twenty
years ago it begins

     with hand upon the lever

      and eye along the track

      the engineer is watching

      while the shades of night grow black

mr t b foreman of metz missouri
asks if we have run across a song beginning

he climbs on his engine and looks about
two short whistles and the drag pulls out

can any reader oblige

  if a reader of chicago illinois will
refer to the railroad mans magazine for
november  he will find that the poem
he asks for  swifty joe by j e hunger-
ford originated in our columns

  expressing a hope that we will not be
offended mr a j ahern of baltimore
sends us another verse for the song  the
rock candy mountains published in the
august number so far from being offend-
ed we are very much obliged to mr ahern
for his interest here is the verse

the punk rolled up his big blue eyes and
      said to his jocko sand

ive been hiking all day long where is that
      gol darn candy

ill hike no more for my feet are sore if
we ever reach that fountain
ill be a  home-guard with a lemonade card
at the big rock candy mountain

a hasty friend

genuine objections are as welcome in
this office as is genuine praise and
much of the popularity we enjoy has been
gained by our readiness to take hints from
our readers the people we are making this
magazine for are the people who buy it and
we like to make it as much in line with their
wishes as is practicable

  we must admit that our friends have
been generous in taking advantage of this
privilege of readers and the letters of criti-
cism we have received have usually been
thoughtful and valuable

  we have just received a letter from a gen-
tleman signing with the initials h e r
to which we fear we must hesitate to apply
these adjectives we fear the gentleman is
hasty in fact from certain slight mis-
statements we are sure of it

  we feel sure that he paused for a mo-
ment and laid aside matters of pressing
official importance to take up his pen and
hurriedly give us much-needed advice his
first point of attack is the article on the air-
brake by c f carter in the september
number

  let us be frank we have tried innu-
merable times to catch mr carter napping
so that we might have the editorial satis-
faction of pointing out to him how little
he knew compared with ourselves and-
we have never succeeded we have come
hopefully upon promising points and have
quoted our authorities with the care-free
indifference of those who know these
things because they cannot help it only to
find that mr carter had the drop  us at
some unguarded spot

it has been like trying to pull clinkers
on the editorial carpet



out of an oil-biirner and frankly we would
give a years subscription for ninety-nine
cents and a postage-stamp to anybody who
would show us how it could be done

  at first when we saw h e rs letter
we were hopeful but by the time we had
finished it our hopes had fallen for we
found that the sum of it was a suggestion
that mr carter get a copy of the westing-
house air-brake companys instruction-book
and copy it verbatim

  now this is biting sarcasm but it really
doesnt prove anything we refrain from
publishing mr carters reply because we
are determined to get even with him some
way

  having thus carefully shown that the air-
brake doesnt work as mr carter says it does
our friend h e r transfers his attention
to the editor of by the light of the
lantern department and the things he does
to him are awful the insignificant fact
that the instance he quotes does not occur
in by the light of the lantern de-
partment at all but in the editorial carpet
does not disturb him

  he declares that the man who attempts
to answer the questions in this department
must have lived close to a railroad at some
time in his life and imagined that he had
absorbed the points of practical railroading
he further suggests-and trusts that we will
take it in the spirit it is intended-that we
 get some one to write in your mechanical
department who is capable and up-to-date
and further volunteers that  there are
plenty of able men whom you can get but
you will have to pay them as men of known
ability come high but as it is at present
your mechanical department and by the
light of the lantern is indeed laugh-
able

  the idea that the editor of by the
light of the lantern department once
lived close to a railroad appeals to us we
imagine that he must have for convenience
sake for at one time in his life not very-
long ago he was master mechanic at the
largest station in the world perhaps he
lives close to a railroad even yet for we
understand that he is a more than ordi-
narily important figure in the mechanical
department of one of the best known rail-
roads in the country

  as h e r is preparing to abandon us
he further informs us that as it is both
departments are a travesty on practical rail-
roading and adds-more we feel in sor-
row than in anger  now look at this
matter seriously and either give the proper
interpretation of a rule and the practical
operation of a piece of machinery or else cut
out the department as i buy the magazine

not for any information  can get from
these departments but for the humor that
they contain as some of the explanations
are ridiculous in the extreme

  friend not for all the world would our
ruthless hands deprive you of that humor
which we feel jou appreciate so keenly and
to which you have added so generously we
have honestly enjoyed your letter-and we
trust you will take this in the spirit it is
intended-and we have been so moved by
it that we have almost decided to live near a
railroad ourselves

train news service

wh c of winnipeg calls our atten-

	tion to the fact that the news serv-
ice recently installed by the great northern
and mentioned in a recent number of the
magazine as a step in the progress of rail-
roading is not by any means an innovation
he tells us that the canadian pacific has
had such a service on its transcontinental
trains for a number of years

  we did not mean that this was an inno-
vation in railroading but that the spread of
such a custom marked a step forward in
rendering railroad travel as a whole more
luxurious and convenient

can you give us a verse boys

gm burnham of miles city mon-

	tana one of our readers has tried to
write a song he did pretty well through
the first verse and the chorus but then he
found that the muse had forsaken him and
his lay written to the tune of  alice where
art thou going halted as it were for
lack of a cylinder and declined to go any
further

  mr burnham therefore appeals to his
fellow readers who may happen to have a
poetic turn to get the other side in working
order so that the song may steam down
the line of fame with its tuneful whistle
playing variations of the well-known air

  here is the cripple in good shape except
for that one cylinder whos got the tools

we are only n p brakemen looking for
     the dough

and when we leave old livingston we do
     not go so slow

well soon be down in billings in a very
      very short time

well take our engine to the house and
     prance right down the line

well play the beanery and vaudevilles you
      know 


the railroad mans magazine

 we are not multimillionaires but we have
       a little dough

 but when the callers ready he will holler

         go 

 well grab a lantern and a club and start to

  accidents badly reported

ak sanderson of buffalo new

 	york has a grievance but as it is
 not against us we sympathize with him and
 congratulate ourselves not that the latter
 is necessary for mr sanderson gives us
 all the congratulation that even the greediest
 of editors could desire

   in the following extremely interesting
 and well-written letter mr sanderson en-
 closed a newspaper account of an accident
 which indeed must have been of so weird
 a nature that nobody but an experienced
 newspaper reporter would have had the
 courage to rush it into print

   no doubt many will agree with me that
 newspaper accounts of railroad accidents
 have always been a source of annoyance to
 railroad men in every case where i have
 known of the cause and the result of such
 accidents the newspaper report was not only
 far from correct but would make one won-
 der how they could obtain a version so
 garbled

   accounts of which i had no knowledge
 other than from the newspapers could be
 easily sized up the one enclosed is a fair
 sample and shows how brave and thought-
 ful the engineer was to shut off steam as
 soon as the boiler exploded

   one day during the last presidential cam-
 paign papers came out with the following
 scare-head

accident to tafts train narrowly
averted by prompt action of tower man
the account condensed said

 train was running sixty miles an hour
 just as tower was reached a cylinder-head
 blew out on engine tower-man saw it
 and immediately put semaphore against train
 and stopped it

 of course the enginemen wouldnt notice a
 little thing like a cylinder-head out so 
 doubt the action- of the tower-man-which
 was commendable-saved the lives of all 
 board

   the railroad stories in papers and maga-
 zines with a very few exceptions are simply
 amusing the brave acts and hairbreadth
 escapes of the entire crew told by a writer
 who wouldnt know whether he was going
 east on the main line or being backed into
 the yard track are to say the least laugh-
 able

   the enclosed lines are sent to you as a
 poetical  curiosity

   the  poetical curiosity  follows and
 what it lacks in quality of verse we are sure
 it makes up in good feeling

railroad literature-past and
present

 the former attempts to cover this field
 have now been made to gracefully yield
 erstwhile competitors lower their shield

 railroad stories by the writers of old
 are the ones that often  knocked you cold
 ignore them now for it will not pay
 longer to read their exciting lay

 romancers they were in more ways than one
 or would have quit before story was done
 and not try to make us believe so soon
 dame nature used cheese to make the moon

 mans wishes now atthe present time
 are for stories truthful of the rail

 nor cares he much if from other clime
 since they follow well the beaten trail

 magazine writers in your popular pages

  chat with a lay reader

ttere is a typical letter from morton-

   a ville california from a reader who
 is not a railroad man perhaps some one
 can give us more specific information about
 the roads mr tongue mentions or can tell
 us of some other instances 

   in reading a very interesting article in
 the september issue of your magazine en-
 titled  some tom thumb railroads i
 happened lo recall two such roads you evi-
 dently overlooked one is four miles long
 and is down-grade all the way from
 exeter missouri to cassville missouri

   exeter is below springfield  the frisco
 railroad i do not remember the name of
 this little railroad

the other road probably belongs to the
on the editorial carpet

pennsylvania and runs from brandywine
maryland to meehanic-sville maryland be-
ing another one-man railroad i dont
know the distance or the name as i havent
traveled it for fifteen years and then for
only one trip

  if your mr willets goes through the
 sunny south he could probably get some
interesting pictures of antiquated locomo-
tives around many of the sawmills

   riding the rail from coast to coast 
contains information about a great stretch
of salt-fields on the western pacific in
utah your readers might be interested to
hear of similar salt deposits for quite a
stretch along the alfalfa route-denver
enid and gulf-now a part of the santa
fe running between enid oklahoma and
kiowa kansas

  your magazine is certainly a winner i
dont see any room for complaint either
although i am not a railroad man still i
find much interesting and instructive read-
ing continued stories are certainly fine

respectfully

paul weber who has done consider-
able railroading in the central america
countries adds an interesting chapter to
the queer methods used in a section where
railroading must be regarded as a joke mr
weber is now located at walnut lake ar-
kansas 

editor the railroad mans magazine

   if you will allow me a little space in your
valuable magazine i will tefl you of a little
experience i had while special traveling
auditor for the salvador railroad com-
pany limited of salvador central amer-
ica the head office of which is in london

  i was under the auditor-general mr
gibson and had orders to check up the con-
ductors and see that everybody had tickets
or passes it was a new order of things
usually everybody could ride that was ac-
quainted with the conductor and if he
showed his pass once he could ride the rest
of the year without ever carrying it again
passes would be exchanged from hand to
hand and maybe twenty or more persons
would ride on one pass at different times

  i	found it very hard to get the aristo-
cratic gentlemen of salvador to get used to



the new orders one day in february s
 our route from the little coast town
acajutla to the capital a distance of sixty-
six miles we had with us in the first-class
coach several very proud-looking gentle-
men accompanied by several officers in uni-
form the conductor asked them for their
passes when one who seemed to be the
leader said that he was colonel gomez the
military commander and governor of the
province of sonsonate that he had his pass
in the office and did not intend to carrj it
or bother himself with it and if we asked
him for a pass again he would have us
thrown off the train by his officers

  there were ten officers with him and
they carried long revolvers it was ad-
visable to let him ride but  reported the
matter to the auditor-general who said if
it happened again he would report it to the
president of course we knew that would
do very little good since every little one-
horse colonel or general with about twenty
men would start a revolution if they were
corrected too severely by their superiors

  there are many generals and to ask them
for their tickets or passes was quite a
strain on us and we had to go at it very
gently we generally kept out of reach of
them

  life is very cheap there and any drunken
officer can shoot a man and will not be
punished because there is no high official
who would dare to punish or correct him

  every one who rides  the trains is
asked by a policeman who enters the cars
his name where he is going and where he
came from if he dont give the informa-
tion he will have to go to the police station

  in the eastern part of salvador another
railroad was almost completed but the peo-
ple there refused to allow the road to be
operated they would wreck the trains
continually and the owners finally quit the
road



more about latin-america

apropos of the constant advice we have
given through the light of the lan-
tern department regarding work in south
and central america we have received the
following letter we are more than glad to
find that our magazine has an interest for
such a varied class of readers and the fact
that men who travel are among the earnest
readers of the railroad mans magazine
helps us in the belief that we are striking
the right key-note

  our correspondent says

  while not a railroad man myself i am
much interested in your magazine and in
any matters relating to railroads as i have
spent fifteen years in the theatrical business
 the road in this country canada mexico
and central america i notice that in al-
most every issue you have inquiries from


the railroad mans magazine

railroad men in different parts of the union
about employment in latin-american coun-
tries

  	have put in some months down there in
my business and have ridden  the greater
number of their lines consequently i have
bad a good chance to get first-hand knowl-
edge of conditions besides i have gotten
what information i could in conversation
with white railroaders from all over who
were employed there at the time

  from what i saw and could gather i
would say to any prospective candidate for
railroad employment in latin-anrerica  let
it alone 

   conditions may seem to a man to be bad
where he is in this country but i will guar-
antee that the worst railroad job in the
united states is a paradise to the best they
have to offer there conditions of life em-
ployment and in fact any and everything
are so much different there that i feel safe
in saying that not one out of a hundred
would stay only long enough to get a stake
to ride back to gods country with

missing relatives

its only when you become very useful to
your friends that you have to make
rules consequently we have to institute
one or two slight restrictions owing to the
physical difficulty of keeping up with the
calls upon our services

  we have from time to time published par-
agraphs requesting information about the
missing relatives of our readers these
paragraphs have been useful to our friends
and a pleasure to us but unfortunately
there are more missing relatives in the
country than we can hope to cope with as a
side issue so we are compelled to draw up
the following regulations

  hereafter all letters asking for informa-
tion about missing men must be accom-
panied by a letter from the company with
whom the lost person was last employed
also a reasonable time must have elapsed
since the person sought was last heard from
or about

  it should be clearly understood by rela-
tives or friends that the authorities of their
own town or neighborhood or of the neigh-
borhood in which their friend was last
heard of can give them much quicker satis-
faction than we can under ordinary circum-
stances therefore these should first be con-
sulted any letter to this magazine should
state exactly what means have been used
for the discovery of the missing person
and when

  in the meantime we hand on a query for
the whereabouts of r w lilly last heard
from when working in or about little rock
arkansas any information should be for-

warded to his mother mrs g w lilly
point of rocks frederick county mary-
land

  we also have a request for information of
the whereabouts of ralph kincaird an
operator last heard of in mantua ohio
four years ago he was then on his way
to sharon pennsylvania

reaching the poles

r i h e gossip of railwaymen  depart-
raent of the san francisco call is an
entertaining column what the jokes lack
in vividness and point they usually make up
in good-nature and railroad atmosphere
and besides have a truer sound than some
of the ultra-smart things that ultra-smart
people who havent got time to be rail-
roaders are supposed to say

  also once in a while they drop us some-
thing that is worth repeating for example
the following

   wanted-ten thousand poles pur-
  chasing department blue ridge line

  highest price for right kind

   and the residt was this 

  dear mr purchasing department-j
have the right kind of poles there are
ten thousand right in new york state and
thereabouts who are willing to go west
and will make the best kind of immigrant
for a young and growing country they
are all familied men and each man has one
wife and from six to one dozen children
if they are not all his children they are his
sisters or his brothers which of course
will make  difference to the railroad com-
pany

    they are all good workmen and some
of them would buy land and farm they
all like cows and other kinds of animals
and never get into fights with railroadmen

    some of them can handle pigs and
hogs and know all about track-building i
think that if you employed them you would
find that the poles you are looking for are
right there every time shall i send them
 to you at once and we can talk over the
price i get for sending them if the first
batch suits

  and what do you think of that asked
the purchasing agent after he had spelled
the letter through and so they can get
along with railroadmen because they can
handle cows and hogs  

    look here boy take this letter over to
the passenger department it evidently has
been addressed wrongly

a living from poultry

in a space of two square feet for each bird no green cut bone of
jry description is led and the food used is inexpensive as compared
with food others are using

 our new book the philo system of poultry keeping gives
full particulars regarding these wonderful discoveries with simple
easy-to-understand directions that are right to the point and  pages
ji illustrations showing all branches of the work from start to finish

dont let the chicks die in the shell

  one of our secrets of success is to save all the chickens that are
fully developed at hatching time whether they can crack the shell
or not it is a simple trick and believed to be the secret of the
ancient egyptians and chinese which enabled them to sell the
chicks at  cents a dozen

  from  hens in ten months

on

city

lot

feet

square



to the average poultry-
man that would seem
impossible and when we
ti ll you that we have
actually done a 
poultry business with 
hens on a sorner in the
city garden  feet wide
by  feet long we are
simply stating facts it
would not be possible to
get such returns by any
one of the systems of
poultry keeping recom-
mended and practiced by
the american people
still it is an easy matter
when the new

 philo
 system

              is adopted

the philo system is unlike all other
ways of keeping poultry

and in many respects just the reverse accomplishing things in poul-
try work that have always been considered impossible and getting
unheard-of results that are hard to believe without seeing

the new system covers all branches
of the work necessary for success

from selecting the breeders to marketing the product it tells how
to get eggs that will hatch how to hatch nearly every egg and how
to raise nearly air the chicks hatched it gives complete plans in
detail how to make everything necessary to run the business and at
less than half the cost required to handle the poultry business in any
other manner

two pound broilers in eight weeks

are raised in a space of less than a square foot to the broiler without
any loss and the broilers are of the very best quality bringing here
three cents per pound above the highest market price

our six-months-old pullets are laying
at the rate of  eggs each per month

chicken feed at  cents a bushel

our book tells how to make the best green food with but little
trouble and have a good supply any day in the year winter or sum-
mer it is just as impossible to set a large egg yield without green
food as it is to keep a cow without hay or fodder

our new brooder saves  cents on
each chicken

no lamp required no danger of chilling overheating or burn-
ing up the chickens as with brooders using lamps or any kind of
fire they also keep all the lice off the chickens automatically or
kill any that may be on them when placed in the brooder our
book gives full plans and the right to make and use them one
can easily be made in an hour at a cost of  to  cents
