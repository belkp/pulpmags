and mail the coupon below and we will send the seven-
teen volumes for your inspection without a cent of cost to
you if you are satisfied keep the books and pay  a
month if not satisfied return the books at our expense

 every lover of literature will appreciate the consummate art of maupas-
 sant he has been ranked by hamilton wright mabie as the fore-
 most master of the art of short-story writing in a group of writers who
 seemed to know instinctively the limitations and resources of a literary
 form which exacts the nicest perception and the surest skill ilis stories
 are held up to the writers of today as models of logical analysis selection
 development and construction

      maupassant wrote with the conviction that no phase of life could
 be so noble or so mean as to be unworthy of chronicling-no groove of
 human virtue or fault wisdom or folly that did not possess its own
 peculiar psychological aspect and therefore demanded analysis

      this edition is unexpurgated and with
 maupassants realism added to the breadth of the
 french school it is literature that should be read
 only by people of mature mind but to such it is
 an intensely interesting study of human nature

     the seventeen volumes

    contain over  pages and  masterpieces-
    studies sketches of travel and adventure tales of
    love comedy tragedy and pathos-with thirty
    illustrations each volume measures x inches-
    printed from large readable clear-cut type on
    heavy eggshell-finished paper with liberal margins
    gold tops and deckeled edges the set is bound in

     the first of the series conies from dixie-the sunny southland-where
the life of the railroad man is just as strenuous as in the northern climes

railroad yarn without its gripping blood-tingling quality

     these from the southland have besides the real dixie-land flavor

the railroad mans magazine

  no i will get you a real one some
day in the near future

   how soon 

    oh pretty soon

  the girl departed and the operator
lighted a cigarette and puffed nervously
ten oclock came and eleven and twelve
and one his key had ceased to click
there would be no more trains till 
when no  freight would pass the
operator settled down to read  the rail-
road robbers revenge

   here ends the first act of this particu-
lar melodrama of the dixie rails now
for the second act

  that same morning at  the men
in the despatchers office in the headquar-
ters building of the norfolk and western
at roanoke were working and yawning
at the same time bored by the eternal
round of the usual

  of a sudden however the unusual
happened - and the chief operator let
loose a laugh that went through the open
window and was heard by the watchman
up in the  crows-nest or signal-tower
that was hung up on the foot-bridge over
the network of tracks that ran by the
headquarters building

    listen to this cried the chief oper-
ator to the other boys  its from dave
chester conductor of no  he wires

 train delayed  untying operator 

   the boys laughed uproariously

    what station  one asked

    elkton

   this ends the second act now for the
third

the retired officer talks

  it was my first morning in roanoke-
january   on my arrival the
night before it took only five minutes to
discover that every third man in roanoke
was a railroader that the norfolk and
western had a monthly pay-roll of over
 that the n and w shops ex-
tended for two miles down the tracks
that the n and w owned about every-
thing in sight including the hotel in
which i was staying that the hotel was
filled with officers of the n and w and
with traveling men who wanted to sell
things to the n and w and that rail-
road stories would begin coming my way
the moment i turned myself loose

   at breakfast that first morning in the
hotel dining-room i found myself at the
table with general passenger agent be-
vill two officers of the supply department
two travelers who wanted to sell things
to the supply department and a retired
n and w officer

   when all had left the table save the
retired officer and myself he suddenly
said

   did you happen to be awake about
 last night suh

   no why  

    well if you had suh you would have
heard a mighty powerful heap of laugh-
ter going on across the way in the des-
patched office you see they received a
despatch from a freight-train conductor
dave chester from down at elkton on
the shenandoah division saying  train
delayed untying operator 

  whats the joke i asked

twas no joke

   taint no joke suh that conduc-
tor wasnt jokin the operator suh was
really tied and he really had to be un-
tied for about ten minutes the whole
thing was a mighty powerful deep dark
mystery - to the despatchers across the
street here

  then in came details no 
freight it seems was crawlin up to
elkton station on time at  this
morning the engineer was expecting to
go past the station without stopping as
usual for there is seldom anything to
stop for at that little place but what
did the engineer find he found the
semaphore set against him so he stopped
then he and conductor chester went into
the station to see what was up

   here the retired railroader stopped to
pour a lot of maple-sugar over his corn-
pone and in impatience i asked

    well what did they find 

    in the station suh they found the
operator tied with rope to the semaphore-
levers and a mail-bag over his head suh

    robbers 

   yes suh two of em with guns
they got the drop on the operator about
one oclock in the morning shoved the
mail-bag over his head and tied him to
the semaphore-levers then they broke
open the cash-drawer rifled it and got
ten thousand miles by rail



away the operator lay there tied like
that for an hour ancla half conductor
chester untied him and then resumed his
run and there you are suh

   did the robbers get much money 

    forty-three dollars and seventy cents
suh but joe funk is already on the job
hell get those robbers in no time

   whos joe funk a detective

   yes one of bill baldwins lieuten-
ants youve heard of bill baldwin
havent you  

joe funk on the job

   yes hes the norfolk and west-
erns chief sleuth and one of the most
famous railroad detectives in the south
 right you are suh and his lieuten-
ant joe funk is not a man to fall down
on a little job like this you may look
for joe funk nabbin hose elkton sta-
tion robbers in about twelve hours from
now i tell you that mornin suh 

  so ended the third act

now for the fourth

  joe funk appeared sud-
denly in elkton to sev-
eral and sundry of the vil-
lage he put this question

 did you see any strangers
hereabouts last night

  the answer was invari-
ably a negative

  joe funk visited the sta-
tion looked sharply at the
operator when the operator
was not looking at funk

and funk made this mental
note  operators eyes close
together can keep a se-
cret

  then he looked carefully
around the station finally
making these further men-
tal notes  operator a ciga-
rette fiend and reads dime-
novels such as  the rail-
road robbers revenge

and theres a girl named
nell

  ten days passed and not
a sign of joe funk in elk-
tori in all that time the
operator continued on his
job if any clue to the
identity of the robbers had

been found it had not been made known
to any one

  suddenly however on the morning of
february i  joe funk loomed up
at the elkton station and conversed with
the operator something like this

at the bottom

   youve been buying things on credit
-trinkets and such things-at martins-
ville and rocky mount your creditors
threaten to garnishee your wages you
owe a lot of money now my boy if
you should pay forty-three dollars and
seventy cents on account it would ease
you up a whole lot wouldnt it 

  the young operator looked at the de-
tective a moment with an inscrutable
smile then said

   yes it would

   well then son pay me that forty-
three-seventy and get eased up

  this ends the fourth act now for the
fifth and last

is this an engagement ring harry


the railroad mans magazine

did you see a man drop a letter in your car
yesterday  

  that same night at dinner  sat in the
hotel dining-room at roanoke when the
retired n and w officer joined me say-
ing

   joe funk is back suh

   back from where  i asked  oh
i added  that elkton-operator-tied-to-
semaphore case

   yes suh its a closed incident now
you see there were no robbers the
operator put the mail-bag over his head
with his own hands and tied himself to
the semaphore-levers and joe is back
with the operators written confession and
the forty - three - seventy in cash and
there are four reasons for that operators
fall suh-just four they are cigarettes
dime-novels debts and girl

  i should add here parenthetically
that roanoke was my fifth stop on my

fourth trip across and around the conti-
nent as correspondent for the railroad
mans magazine my present ten-
thousand-mile-story-gathering tour of the
railroads began with a southward flight
of  miles to philadelphia baltimore
and washington and thence through
dixie-kind that flight included thirteen
stops at these stopping-
places the railroad boys kind-
ly contributed to my note-
books the dramas melodra-
mas and comedy-dramas here
related for the sake of
 law and order i will relate
these yarns in the geographical
sequence in which they were
told to me in my progress from
new york to new orleans

   at ten oclock on a very hot
   morning in july  a taxi-
   cab pulled up in front of the
   broad street station phila-
   delphia at the entrance where
   the sign read general of-
   fices pennsylvania railroad
   the passenger who alighted
   and with a wave of his hand
   returned the  good morn-
   ing  of the doorman was a
   commander of men although
   he didnt look his sixty years

  he carried two yards of
 height straight as a signal-
 post and two hundred weight
 of bone and flesh with the
 grace of an athlete in the
 corridor while waiting for the elevator
 he took off his straw hat and with it
 fanned himself he had plenty of hair
 which like his square-trimmed beard was
 tinged with gray

   at the first floor he left the elevator
 and entered an office the door of which
 was lettered 

president

  now the commander described was
 too fine a man to perish by an assassins
 hand if it could be helped at least so
 thought the young man who now entered
 the presidents office and stepped up to
 the great mans desk to say

    mr mccrea heres a letter needing
 the immediate attention of a detective
ten thousand miles by rail

   good morning derousse returned
the commander whats this why
do you look so excited 

  oswald derousse was chief clerk to
the president

   its addressed to you personally
sir derousse said  and the writer
swears he will blow the president of the
pennsylvania railroad into kingdom
come unless  is forthcoming as
ransom for your safety he says hell
even go so lar as to blow up broad street
station in order to get you

  anonymous snapped mr mccrea

the cool mccrea

 yes sir the writer says that by
way of answer we must insert a per-
sonal in the richmond timcs-des patch
using a masonic sign for the purpose
mr mccrea took the letter and read

     this is a declaration of war my
   life is openly staked on the result i
   shall use dynamite

   without reading further he handed it
to derousse saying

   what postmark

    burkeville virginia

  on the norfolk and western

    yes sir

   all right he gave two short in-
cisive orders

  a few hours later the gateman at
track nine at the broad street station
closed the gate as the train on that track
began pulling out for the south just
then a small man with a big head a
bronzed face and eyes like a hawk rushed
up to the gateman and showed a badge
the gateman immediately reopened the
gate and the small man dashed through
it ran down the platform and leaped
aboard the rear car of the outgoing
south-bound train

    bill said the gateman to the attend-
ant at the adjoining gate  if that man
was not captain bill baldwin it was his
double

  captain bill baldwin if the man who
caught that south-bound train were in-
deed he was small as i have said he
had a big name as a railroad detective
and possessed a trigger finger much dis-
liked by bad men in the south

  he was the head of the baldwin de-

tective agency with headquarters at
roanoke virginia  and was moreover
the chief of the secret service of the nor-
folk and western railway

closing in

  i	repeat if the small man who hew
through the gate was indeed bill bald-
win then it was a fortuitous circum-
stance that he happened to be in phila-
delphia that day when the threatening
letter reached president mccreas office

  at richmond that same day post-
office inspector bill calvert received a
telegram which caused him to secure a
copy of the richmond times-dcs patch
the following morning and mark a cer-
tain personal with a blue pencil the
personal contained a sign of a secret or-
der

   at burkeville virginia two days la-
ter two small men interviewed a certain
railway mail-clerk

   did you see a man drop a letter in
your car yesterday the mail-clerk was
asked

    yep

   you knew him 

   you bet  he named a man high
up in burkeville

    what  exclaimed one of the inter-
viewers not that man you are
sure 

    positive

  twelve hours later one of the two
small men said to the other

    hes crazy

    not at all said the other  hes
perfectly sane he thinks he has a griev-
ance against the pennsy his father
owned some stock in a branch railroad
down here which was reorganized
through pennsy influence the man who
mailed that letter fancies his father lost
 as the result of the reorganiza-
tion no it is not insanity its spite

the meeting

  a few days later the man high up in
burkeville received a letter from de-
rousse chief clerk to the president of
the pennsy saying that his superior ac-
ceded to the demand for  cash and
transportation to philadelphia

next day derousse received a letter


the railroad mans magazine

dated at philadelphia in which the writer
said he would meet derousse at noon at
the broad street station  ready for
business at noon accordingly a man
stepped up to derousse and said 

   im the man you expect are you
ready for me  

   yes promptly returned derousse
 come right over to the bank

  the chief clerk led the stranger to the
third national bank where he secured
a certified check for  and prof-
fered it to the stranger saying that the
railroad felt that  was exorbitant
but that it would stand for 

   no i wont take that protested the
stranger  you hold on to that money
a while however till i make up my mind
whether to let you off so easy

  but just then a pair of handcuffs were
clamped on the stranger-by a post-office
inspector who said

 your honor is under arrest for send-
ing threatening letters through the mail
derousse hastened to the office of the
commander in chief of the p r r and
said

   mr mccrea you are safe from dyna-
mite for some time to come

  who was the man the president
asked

   the mayor of burkeville virginia
sir

  detective bill baldwin and post-office
inspector bill calvert adjourned to the
nearest drug-store and ordered two ice-
cream sodas

a certain pay-train

  a baltimore and ohio train on a cer-
tain night in september s pulled out
of washington bound for some place
west of harpers ferry where a number
of federal regiments were mobilized
the train was carrying money to those
troops it was indeed a government
pay-train consisting of the pay-car and
one coach drawn by the locomotive
 henry clay on board was a train-
crew of seven men including breen the
engineer also four government officers
they were armed to the teeth

  toward midnight with right-of-way
over everything the train was flying
through one of the longest tunnels in the
alleghanies some forty or fifty miles

west of harpers ferry when suddenly
engineer breen desperately signaled
down brakes the brakemen now
nearly tore their arms out by the roots
in twisting the brake-wheels

  the moment the train stopped every
man aboard jumped off each carrying
either a winchester or a revolver up
head engineer breen was seen talking
to a young girl who carried a lantern
and was gesticulating wildly

   come here quick you fellows
shouted breen  and hear what this girl
is telling me there is a plot afoot to
wreck us the switch at the signal-
shack at the other end of this tunnel has
been set to derail us and all of us not
killed in the mix-up were to be murdered
like dogs the plan of the wreckers was
to get the money were carrying 

  the girl then rapidly outlined her ter-
rible experiences of the night

the missing operator

  she said she was jennie garth of har-
pers ferry a sister of harry garth the
signal and switch tender who lived in
the shack at the west end of the tunnel
she had come down by rail that day from
harpers ferry to see her brother
arriving at the shack she found that he
was not at his pest

  night fell and jennie waited for her
brother ten oclock came and-still no
harry

  meantime jennie resolved to flag the
first train that came along and report her
brothers absence feeling certain that
some ill-fortune had befallen him

  of a sudden she heard quick but
stealthy footsteps outside and a moment
later two men one old and the other
young bounded into the shack and came
to a standstill as if surprised

   hes not here the old man said
looking around the only room he then
stepped toward jennie a knife gleaming
in his hand

  jennie frozen with fear could not ut-
ter a word

   no dad interposed the young man
 remember your promise-no violence
here leave the girl to me

  with that the young fellow who car-
ried a coil of rope seized jennie and
dragged her to the corner where the bed
ten thousand miles by rail



stood it was a four-poster and to one
of the posts he lashed the girl when
the old man went to the door to peer out
the young man whispered 

he confides

 keep still gal dont be fright-
ened keep your mouth shut my

fright that she could hardly keep from
sinking down thus drawing the ropes cru-
elly tight about her for half an hour or
more she steeled herself against attacks of
faintness and then-the young man re-
appeared and blew out the lamp

   i doubled on the old man he panted
 hest after me so l must hurry so
must you gal my father has spiked the

hes going to wreck the pay-train and kill the crew

father has gone clean crazy hes going
to wreck the pay-train and kill the
crew and steal the money but im go-
ing to stop him

   come along ordered the old man
turning to his son

  the son waited till the old man
stepped out then whispered to jennie

   your brother is safe gal dont
worry he fell-up in the hills-and
broke his knee-cap i knew lie wasnt
here but i wouldnt tell my old man
with that the young man left the shack
following his father out into the night
and leaving jennie so paralyzed with

switch and  cant reset it the pay-train
is coming you take a lantern light it
after yoil get far inside the tunnel and
stop that train

   meantime ill let the old man get on
my track again and while he is running
after me youll have a good chance to save
the train

to save the train

  he loosened the rope and jenniewas
free

  out of the door dashed the young man
jennie realizing that the lives of the men


the railroad mans magazine

on the pay-train were in her hands sum-
moned courage to obey the instructions
given by the young stranger

  carrying an unlighted lantern she ran
to the tunnel when she had stumbled
over the ties for a quarter of a mile she
lighted the lantern-and waited

  presently the headlight of a locomotive
appeared at the far end jennie raised
her lantern and waved it frantically and
as i have told the train stopped

  but even then with the pay-train saved
the drama of the night was not ended

shots are fired

   	vliile the train still stood in the tunnel
and just as jennie finished telling her
story to engineer breen and the trainmen
and while the government men were form-
ing plans to capture the old rogue a wild
shout was heard in the tunnel and into
the rays of the headlight dashed the young
man next came a deafening report and
he fell never to rise again his father
had killed him

  then with another blood - curdling
shriek the old maniac rushed into view
with his winchester leveled at jennie
at the same time however one of the
train-crew fired and down went the homi-
cide the man who fired the shot that
saved jennie garths life was engineer
breen

  the crew took jennie aboard proceed-
ed cautiously to the switch unspiked it
left a brakeman in charge atthe shack
and then went on to their destination

  the next day the pay-train carried jen-
nie back to harpers ferry she was re-
warded by both the p and o and the
government with sums of money

  the old villain in the drama was a
notorious character who with his son had
lived for years in an almost inaccessible
part of the alleghanies  red  bour-
bontie was called fi is sons name was
jim poor jim bourbon 

 old man  whitney sometimes called

	chi  whitney an old baltimore and
ohio railroader of baltimore gave me
these facts

  the heroine of the story j ennie garth
was then only seventeen years of age
 old man  whitney said that when he
last heard of her in  she was still
living in harpers ferry a spinster

  train no  from pittsburgh pulled
into the station at washington one morn-
ing in november s the conductor
as he walked up the platform chanced to
meet a fellow-wielder of the ticket-punch
to whom he said

  jim how long is a penn ticket good
for a ride 

   till midnight on date of issue or as
otherwise specified in contract printed on
said ticket at the most thirty days
replied jim

   then a ticket issued in the year of
our lord  wouldnt carry a passen-
ger very far to-day would it 

   not on your life

   well look here he handed jim a
ticket

   why exclaimed jim  this ticket is
thirty-nine years old 

   yes assented the conductor of no
  ive figured that this ticket is about
 days overdue

  well what of it you didnt carry
a passenger on that worthless paper did
you

   thats just what i did jim the
penn has smashed its own rule regarding
the time limit on tickets to smithereens
at the broad street station philadel-
phia at nine-fifty-five in the evening the
head boss of the night force in the tele-
graph department of the pennsylvania
railroad received a message from con-
ductor malloy of no  the message
that was put on the wire at johnston when
malloys train from pittsburgh to wash-
ington stopped there read

    passenger has tendered for transpor-
  tation ticket issued in  by louis-
  ville and lexington railroad reading
  good for one first-class passage from
  cincinnati o to washington d c
  ticket so worn with age that had much
  difficulty in deciphering name of railroad
  what shall i do answer to johnston
  meanwhile will let the passenger ride

a puzzling matter

  the boss telegrapher scratched his
head this plainly was a matter for the
passenger department but the heads of
that department never work at night
what should he do finally he went to
the telephone and called up general
passenger agent boyd at his house and
ten thousand miles by rail



jcj

matter for the passenger department

 to him read the con-
 ductors odd message

    why that ticket
 is thirty - nine years
 of age  exclaimed
 mr boyd  how-
 ever leave it to me

 ill let you knovv
 what to do good-
 by

   mr boyd called
 up passenger traffic
 manager wood and
 explained all about
 the thirty-nine-year-	this was a

 old ticket

     but a railroad ticket of that sort is
 good only up to midnight on date of
 issue said the p t m

     yes rules is rules quoth the g p a

     all the same it ought to go into the
 museum said the p t m

    yes it should be put in a real nice
 frame replied the g p a

     oh well leave it to me finally said
 the p t m  ill let the telegraph man
 know

   he telephoned colonel barksdale head
 of the publicity department

    leave it to me said barksdale to
 the p t m  ill let the telegraph man
 know

   meantime no  in charge of conduc-
 tor malloy was flying eastward the
 train had left pittsburgh at  and was
 pulling into johnston at  malloy
 rushed to the telegraph man saying

    got a special message for me from
 broad street 

    nope

    good heavens cried malloy and
 that old man riding free all aboard  
 he shouted  and then in a lower tone
 wonder vhy they dont answer ive
 copped the ticket anyway its the whole
 class dont dare punch it i just cant
 let go of that ticket yet i dare not let
 that passenger go on riding without
 orders all aboard

 here called the telegraph man

  heres your answer

 malloy simply devoured that message
 with his eyes all it said was

    honor the ticket

                          barksdale

  barksdale  said malloy to one of

 the brakemen as the train sped on
  whats he got to do with it   know
 hell get the story in the newspapers
 barksdale certainly is on his job night
 and day

believed in education

  bob weaver engineer of the southern
railway with a run in the  land of the
sky where the road drops south from
lynchburg virginia and then up and
over the stupendous black mountains and
past asheville north carolina had a
hobby

  it was education he believed educa-
tion to be a panacea for all the ills of all
the  poor whites mountaineers hill-
billies moonshiners and blockade-runners
on his division

  here is an example of how he would
give his hobby exercise

  one day in the spring of  he was
running his train the southern express
through a notch in the mountains north of
asheville where the road-bed winds along
the side of the mountain a thousand feet
above the valley

  he found a signal set against him and
was obliged to halt he had to stop there
fully two hours during which time a
number of the mountaineers and their
families came down to the track to stare
at the passengers seated at the windows
among these was a young girl to whom
bob weaver said

   whats your name gal  

   nan gibson

 how old

   fourteen

   go to school  


the railroad mans magazine

  no sir aint no school yereabouts
to go to

   whos the kids with you  

   thems mah little brothers and sis-
ters

   father living 

   yes

   mother

   no shes daid

   and so you have to stay home and
mother the family-is that it

    yes sir

  well by hooky its wrong all
wrong you should have an education
youd know then how to take care of
these kids all the better youd do your
work easier-like my name is bob wea-
ver but if id been named andrew carr
negie id turn you into an island nan
entirely surrounded with books good-by
nan

  after that every time bob weaver ran
down through that notch way up in the
air with the mountain towering on one
side and a sheer precipice of a thousand
feet on the other he would think of nan
gibson with protesting thoughts against
the fate that left her without an educa-
tion

fine place for a wreck

   and wouldnt this spot be a place for
a wreck  bob weaver said one day to
his fireman as the train ran down through
the notch

   guess yes answered the fireman
then came a day in april -
some weeks after the meeting of bob
weaver and nan gibson-when the
southern express at  in the morn-
ing was thundering and grinding down
the mountain and bob weaver gave a
yell of alarm and jammed on the emer-
gency

  on the track ahead stood a girl wa-
ving something red

   its that gal nan gibson shouted
weaver as his train came to a standstill
 and by heaven look there ahead  he
continued  a rock slide a billion
tons of rock and earth on the right-of-
way

  comprehending now the full signifi-
cance of the presence of nan and the red
thing she had waved and which proved
to be her petticoat bob weaver sprang

from his cab and ran to the girl fol-
lowed by his fireman and the train-crew
and every man woman and child from
the coaches and pullmans

how it happened

   youre an angel from heaven   cried
weaver seizing the girl and lifting her
in his arms and holding her up so all
the crew and passengers could take a look
at her

   but for this gal he shouted  wed
probably all be lyin a thousand feet be-
low here in the stream through the gorge
without further use for the southern
railway

  the moment weaver placed the girl on
the ground the women passengers
swarmed around her they hugged her
and kissed her and wept on her neck and
thanked her and blessed her

   howd it happen nan bob wea
ver asked

   ah was peelin the tatoes fo dinner
she said  when ah heard a awful noise
like the mountain was crackin open ah
looked out of the do and saw part of the
mountain-rocks trees and all-slidin
down onto the railroad track and i
says to myself an its train-time too
we aint got no clock or watch into our
house but ah knew by the sun that it was
near time for this yere train so ah runs
down yere and takes off mah skirt and
flags you thats all

  the passengers had taken up a collec-
tion they handed nan a hatful of
money

   the money aint no good to her with-
out education murmured bob weaver
then he took nan aside and said to her

   listen to your uncle bob gal you
remember what i tell you this contribu-
tion is merely from the passengers as an
expression of gratitude for savin us-all
from a wreck but pretty soon a man
from the southern railway will come
down here to see you-cause my road
aint no slouch to forget to reward an act
like yours

gave it to dad

   now when that man from my road
comes here nan you tell him that what
you want is an education will you re-
ten thousand miles by rail



member gal get that word on the brain
-education and leave your uncle bob
to do the rest

  the wrecking outfit came and cleared
away the  billion  tons of rock and
trees and earth and rebuilt the track

  nan gibson gave the hatful of money
to her father who promptly went down

   nan want a education the father
asked turning to his daughter

   education-thats the word re
sponded nan

  at the opening of the fall term of
 at the normal collegiate institute
at asheville north carolina the girls
poured in from all parts of the south

into the valley and bought a little cot-
tage and took nan and the kids down
there-and everybody was happy nan
pronounced the word  education  every-
day-but still day after day passed and
no one from the southern railway put in
an appearance

  in june however - about five weeks
after the greatest day in nans life-the
 man from the southern railway 
showed up

  he was a kind soft-voiced man and to
nans father he said 

   my road wishes to reward your
daughter for averting what might have
been a terrible disaster-up there in the
notch we want to make the reward
not only substantial but permanent
our engineer robert weaver in charge
of the train which your daughter saved
has suggested to the company that we
pay for your daughters education at a
seminarv

and one of them signed this name on the
register

   nana gibson

  the southern railway paid the bills

  and every time bob weaver drove the
southern express through asheville he
would chuckle

his lonesome night

  on the train that carried me from
roanoke to natural bridge i repeated
the story of the operator who tied himself
to the semaphore-rods to a young man to
whom i was introduced by conductor
kirby his name is robert hanson he
is an itinerant railroad telegrapher and
my story brought out this one from my
new friend he said it would  go mine
one better

   the hero said hanson  was a
friend of mine and i remember the de-
tails as if it were yesterday

 education-thats the word
responded nan


the railroad mans magazine

   at eleven oclock on the night of de-
cember   ed hutchison agent
operator for the b and o at claring-
ton west virginia some twenty miles
south of wheeling put some more coal
in the stove raked the fire down and
then watched the stove grow red in the
face a biting wind was sweeping down

from the hill and plenty of fuel was
needed to keep the station warm ed
hutchison then responded to the click of
his key for a while wrote out some re-
ports then paced up and down the office
stopping now and then to peer out into
the night

 he was lonesome it was new
years eve and he knew that many of
the young folks of the town were assem-
bling to watch the old year out and the
new year in-a social occasion from
which he was barred by duty as he
once again paced toward the window he
saw a face pressed to the panes it was
a mans face and it was bearded sud-
denly it vanished 

  he rushed to the door and flew out
to the platform no one was in sight

        was it a hill-billy

    queer he muttered returning to
the warmth of his office  was that an
apparition or was it really the face of
the hill-billy and moonshiner known as
stale bread carney wonder what
hes up to loitering around here at this
hour of the night 

 he dismissed from his mind the face
he had seen at the window and thought
of another-a much lovelier face-the
face of bess delisle one of
the prettiest girls in the town

 ed hutchison was only
twenty-and with all the ar-
dor of his youth he wished
he might attend the  watch-
night party  that bess de-
lisle was holding at her house

   the door-flew open and
  in bounded three men one
  of them covering ed with a
  revolver the men had ban-
  dannas over their faces one
  whose beard was not fully
  covered by the handkerchief
  said to the operator

    open that safe or
youre a dead one  

   ed had been edging to-
  ward the drawer in which
  lay his gun

  none o that com-
manded the man with the be-
traying beard  step the other
way-and open that safe 

   what could a boy of twenty do in
the power of three desperadoes except
comply with their demand

   ed opened the safe

the mask falls

   the bearded robber while one of his
pals kept the operator covered knelt in
front of the safe and ransacked it till he
found the money in the course of this
performance however the handkerchief
covering his face fell off with a quick
look he saw by the expression of the
operators face that he was recognized

     ill fix you so you cant tell noth-
in   he swore
ten thousand miles by rail



   without bothering to hide his face
again he sprang at the operator and
struck him on the head with the butt of
his gun and ed hutchison collapsed

   the three men kicked over the stove
scattering the live coals over the floor
then they made their getaway

   meantime up at bess delisls house
a number of young folks were dancing
and making merry generally till sudden-
ly some one announced that the hour of
twelve was striking ushering in 
cow-bells horns and whistles combined
in a deafening racket then a girls
voice was heard crying

    fire the stations on fire  

   it was the voice of the sweetheart of
the man at the station-bess- delisle

   hastily seizing hats and wraps the
young folks sped out of the house and
toward the burning station with bess
leading	

    ed hutchinson is there all alone 
she cried as she ran along

    hoy-yoy  yelled the young men of
the party as they passed each house on
the way thus arousing the inmates

   the alarm spread and by the time
the party from besss house reached the
station a hundred townspeople had
joined them and all now got to work
trying to save the building

   buckets were found water was
brought from the tank-but the volun-
teer fire-fighters could see plainly that the
holocaust was beyond control and the
station was doomed

    but wheres ed   called bess de-

lisle  he must be inside the building
why doesnt he come out

    yes wheres ed  chorused the men
of besss party they smashed the door
of the wareroom at the farther end of
the station they dashed into the build-
ing through the smoke and flame - to
emerge a minute later carrying the ap-
parently lifeless form of ed hutchinson

    ed  my ed   called bess delisle
bending over the operator as they laid
him on the ground  why hes been
hurt  she added  hes bleeding  look 
a gash in his head  

   bess dipped her handkerchief into
one of the useless buckets of water and
washed the blood from eds brow and
as she did so ed opened his eyes

    good-by bess he said  im going
 no no  protested bess  tell us
what happened she added

   ed hutchison gaspingly outlined the
story of what had befallen him the
men of the party yelled  stale bread
carney will pay for this when we find
him well lynch him 

    the robbers thought by firing the
station one young man said  that ed
would be cremated and we would never
know what really happened

 ed my ed dont go away
sobbed bess as the operator finished his
story fell back and grew rigid

   five minutes later the biting wind
was sweeping down from the hills around
and around the living bess delisle who
lay on the ground with her lips pressed
to- those of her dead sweetheart

in the next issue mr willets will relate some more of the dramas of dixie

         when the air turns soft and balmy
         and the birds begin to sing

             when the winter old and haggard
             gives the right of way to spring

     when the orchard trees are buddin

     and the grass begins to sprout

                             then i want to go a fishin

              and my gaze goes out the winder

              and my mind goes up the track

               and i kinda wish that traffic
               was a little bit more slack

                                         thus i slave from morn till evenin

that street-flushing scheme was the
real article

 valhalla in the hills

by emmet f harte

   how the water-power of the perfect town proved one too
   many for honk and horace not to mention the capitalists

  he last roll of sod had been
 r i laid and soaked with water
iiiiiu and the last posy-bed round-
gj i w ed symmetrically at the
ctjusj western terminus of the p

            and p and honk and yours
of the clacking conversation sat gloomily
silent in the medicine-house our work
of parking the stations and beautifying
the outlook for the long-necked hordes
that travel was done

  thoughtfully  inserted a record in
our old comrade with the battered horn
and pulled the trigger the tune was
peculiarly fitting-it was something that
went  ta-ta an rcvoir good-by 

  not that honk groaned ho
hum not that heigh-ho aint we
just about the next thing to out of a
job at this minute whats your idea in
playing that gruesome thing

   excuse me i said  but then ive
told you time after time that we were
getting this work done too fast we
ought to have made it last a year longer
at least but you wouldnt listen youre
one of these ambitious lads thats got to
do it all right at once-

  i paused as a shadow passed the win-
dow  here comes sad-cye   samuel
dyer collins otherwise sad-eye was one
of the operators at the union depot of-
fice he bore tidings addressed to honk
which same i took and read

    simpson etc come headquarters
  bring car immediate important

dade

gen land and immigration agent

  hurrah and whoopee said honk
after  read it aloud  horace i told


the railroad mans magazine

you something would turn up for us it
never fails im a mascot and he
slapped sad-eye resoundingly on the
back  trust to me im it

   also something of a liar i said
 you never told me any such a thing
just a moment ago you were beefing
about us being the next thing to out of
a job hand back that plug of tobacco

i	gave you a half-hour ago too as soon
as you get around to it

   horace -his tone was reproachful
- youre getting more exacting and
pettish every day you live with
which he went out to attend to our being
attached to first train east

  the trip back over the line was un-
eventful as unexciting a four days jour-
ney as you could wish to take many
points along the line recalled memories
though-eagle plume where little mack
had found the gold-mine which turned
out a false alarm after all blue butte
where our handiwork still stood an
oasis in the surrounding desert and other
points that suggested scenes - comic
tragic and otherwise we flitted on

landing at last with a final screak and
jar in the big terminal-sheds of the
other end

  it was nearly noon when we arrived
so we cooked and annihilated a couple
of dollars worth of cartc-blanche grub
as our old friend willard at rivervale
calls short orders then at peace with all
the world and unafraid we strolled up
to dades office in the burton building
arm in arm

  the general land and immigration
agent was in and he wasnt near so big
as his title he was one of those little
runty men that walk bow - legged and
have bristles on the back of their necks
with a voice that sounded like it needed
dressing down on the emery-wheel but
he was loaded for us and made his talk
without any preliminaries other than a
peculiar explosive husk-loosening he had

   bhum  he said  ive heard
about you two and ive seen a bit of
your work along the-line it looks good
to me ive prevailed on the company
to let me have the benefit of your services
for a while in the work of exploiting

hurrah and whoofee
said honk
valhalla in the hills



 improving and colonizing our land hold-
 ings out in the mystic hills country
 bhum  he finished with a resound-
 ing guttural and waited glowering at us
 like a pug dog with the asthma

   i looked at honk and honk favored
 me with his regard then my old time-
 tested friend spoke as was his wont

    on behalf of horace here who is a
 great hand at the kind of work you men-
 tion but wont admit it we are yours to
 command he said  spin on

    bhum   dade detonated  all
 right the p and p owns a million
 acres or so between thered river and
 the sierras some of its good and some
 of its worse its all salable and we
 can and will sell it

    its pretty dry out there but well
 have to rustle some water some way
 were willing to spend some money on
 the project - a lot of money in fact
 bhum the soil is-well you know
 what it is youve been to blue butte
 i know what you fellows did there

    ever hear of a town called arlene
 no its out there in our tract quite a
 town a mile of brick buildings opera-
 house banks stores everything and not
 a living soul in the town deserted
 abandoned-bhum  

   he waved a hairy hand airily and con-
 tinued want you fellows to go out
 there-its twenty miles or so from mil-
 lardsville i believe you can drive over
 -take a force of men with you and put
 arlene in shipshape slick her up you
 know and all that ready for visitors

    then ill bring out a train-load or
 two of investors and well auction off
 the town and in the twinkling of an eye
 have a thriving city afterward we will
 throw open the surrounding country for
 settlement induce the land-hungry pub-
 lic to come and coming they will buy
 settle and remain

    well build a spur from the main
 line to arlene and-presto the desert
 blooms as the rose that opens its petals
 and-bhum 

   they mans enthusiasm leaped to us
 like a jump - spark ignition and all
 aflame we arose and shook his hand the
 scheme looked like simplicity itself

    but remember honk said an hour
  later as we prepared to depart  the
  town is arlene no longer it is valhalla 

    	r r

valhalla in the hills horace were off
in a bunch 

  the trivialities of gathering together
a force of men of shipping supplies-
such as paints wall-paper whitewash ce-
ment tools and foodstuffs and a thou-
sand other things-we put through with
a hurrah it was dead easy for us we
could certainly spend other peoples
money with gusto

  one day the whole works swarmed
into arlene - or valhalla  should say
-and the game began did you ever
see one of those enchanted cities you read
about in the arabian nights where
all the population from the sparrows in
the streets to the hallo girls in the tele-
phone central had been turned into
highly polished black marble never
did 

  neither did i but this deserted town
of arlene was about like that same i
guess except that there wasnt any popu-
lation at all the population had been
spirited away entirely but the town was
there all intact convenient and com-
plete

  as dade said there were brick build-
ings well-built streets sidewalks block
after block of residences all untenanted
the hitch-racks were there around the
little plaza and odds and ends evidences
of former activities such as scraps of
paper tin cans and cigar-ends in the
areavvays were plentiful

  one could imagine that presently a
sunburned team of plugs hitched to a
rattly buggy would appear around the
corner or somebody would hallo from
the open up-stairs window of a building
marked  saloon  across on the corner
but no such thing happened arlene was
a dead one

   horace said honk to me  heres
where well spread ourselves heres
where well build a city thatll make em
all do the gawk act ive dreamed of
this but i never thought it would come
true he scanned the near - by hills
narrowly and swept the level plain with
a self-satisfied glance north east and
west

  just there-he pointed a lean fin-
ger toward the west- well build our
aqueduct and store the snow - water
look at these brick-paved streets-well
flush em every night ill have a clock-


the railroad mans magazine

work arrangement to do it automatically
at a certain hour

    well make a continuous flower-gar-
den on both sides of these here streets
well build our own electric plant run
the city water supply through a turbine
for power throwing two stones at one
bird as it were its swell fine
hooray hows your stock of chewing
holding out  

    while i think of it i said  whats

hear i said but go on in lemons
im with you if we dont do it well
leave it in such a fix nobody else will
we rallied together our twenty men
gave em instructions and started the
ball rolling it was a systematic and
intelligent crusade against the natural
order of decay in the town from that
time on we cleaned up painted and
repapered the place from john ogroats
to the milky way

glowering at us like a pug dog with asthma

going to be the main industry of this
valhalla community 

   sugar-beet factories truck-farming
brick-making cement he snorted con-
temptuously  ill start a flying-ma-
chine factory thatll employ five hundred
men if nothing else gee anybody to
hear you ask questions would think your
ideas had started to ingrow on you
well make this village the eighth won-
der of the twentieth century already
i can hear the hum of dynamos and the
whir of machinery under the brow of
yonder hill-

   thats the wheels in your head you

  if we found a shanty that didnt suit
us or that honk thought wouldnt look
artistic when rejuvenated we either
razed burned down or blew it up and
made a park a flower-maze or a drink-
ing fountain in its place we repaired
pavements and sidewalks straightened
up streets sent for more men and teams
started our reservoir dam and drilled for
artesian water on suspicion

  the original population of the town
had had a few wells with a kind of soap-
sudsey tasting water in them whose only
merits were a certain wetness and the fact
that it did not immediately result fatally
valhalla in the hills



these we left alone for the time being
later they were filled up

  we established a twice-a-day line of
wagon communication with the railroad
and offered free transportation and house
rent to desirable families that wished tq
come in and get on the ground floor of
valhallas wave of prosperity hows
that for maudlin metaphor

  while the water supply question was
being investigated we designed and laid
out a park and boulevard system finished
up all the concrete part walks foun-
tains and cascades-everything up to
snuff we had it all ready for the turn-
ing on of the water

   the populace of valhalla will have
playgrounds here for future generations
honk said and while we were about it
he set up a number of artificial stone
pedestals in the parks

  whats them for i askfcd

  statues of valhallas great men to
be erected later he said cheerfully

    and is mine one   quoted

  nit-not so he replied your
fat face wouldnt look well in marble it
takes a grecian profile like mine to show
up

   ive seen em like yours  said
 profile and front elevation on the same
card with measurements location of
scars moles and warts described on the
back

   along about that time the well-drillers
struck a hundred-barrel-a-minute flow of
water at some seven hundred feet in
depth and blew their apparatus up on
top of a near-by building they also
flooded that part of town it took us a
week to cap it and the whole force was
pretty well bedraggled before it was
done ten families moved into valhalla
the next day

  honk ordered every available man to
the work of laying mains and the town
hummed with industry two general
stores opened up for business and a man
brought a roulette and faro outfit over
with a glad smile

   it made quite a nice little bonfire with
gasoline when we burned it i touched
it off and honk gave the fellow six sec-
onds to get out of range he made it in
five

   while i have it on my mind he
mentioned for the benefit of those present

  i want it understood generally over the
 country that while horace and me are
 sojourning around here valhalla aint go-
 ing to be no disreputable mining-camp
 all you boys can send picture-postals to
 your friends to that effect

     every desirable citizen who favors us
 with his presence will receive a warm
 welcome and well try to find something
 for him to do  but the undesirables-siss
 boom horace tell bill smith to wire
 for two car-loads of sod and a thousand
 maple-trees when he gets to millardsville
 this afternoon and for em to rush it

   three weeks after we commenced op-
 erations valhalla was coming out of the
 kinks the watc-r-works dam was stead-
 ily climbing a solid barrier of masonry
 across the ravine between two hills

honk estimated that the number of
 gallons of water he would have stored
back of that dam by the following spring
would be sutficient to reclaim the entire
mystic hills country and then some

    the string of figures he had on the
 subject was a foot and four inches long-
 i measured it with a ruler

   honk also had half a dozen things
 plotted in the way of plants for running
 dynamos to furnish light heat and
 horse-power so cheap the inhabitants
 would think they stole ir and his head
 was so full of pet projects for making
 valhalla a living wonder in the way of a
 spotless town that his skull was beginning
 to bulge in places

    talk about the ideal towns of some
 of these eastern capitalists he kept din-
 ning in my ears  well make em all run
 for cover here well have a perfect
 climate the unsullied soil in its virgin
 purity a city built on scientific and artis-
 tic lines everything hygienic orderly and
 ornate

    when the good housewife needs a
 small order of groceries she writes a slip
 and inserts it in a pneumatic tube-
 whisk in a few minutes the white-
 aproned clerk stops his rubber-tirecl elec-
 tric cart in the paved alley at the rear and
 delivers the parcels

     well harness this mysterious force
 of electricity to do the drudgery of val-
 halla on wash-day the good housewife
 dumps the soiled clothing of the family
 into a tank presses a button and behold
 the said apparel comes out washed


the railroad mans magazine

starched dried ironed and folded neat-
ly ive got the machine to do it with
all worked out in my mind he tapped
his forehead with a smudgy forefinger
and went right on

   well have no ratty back yards and
stinking garbage piles in the alleys of
this city all refuse will go into a chute
that will lead to an electric incinerator
whatll be the consequence no flies
no vermin no disease-germs no sickness
mortality reduced to the minimum-

   why not cut out the mortality alto-
gether i interrupted we can refuse
to let any doctors in and-

   future generations growing up in an
atmosphere of health beauty and intel-
ligence he continued unmoved  will
become broader-minded more perfect
physically and-and-hows your chew-
ing horace

   i only see one drawback i said
while he was loading up  and that is
the fact that youll have to contend with
a lot of pork-heads thatll likely have
little ideas of their own to introduce free
of charge

   them well eliminate lie said
 whenever a mossback pops into val-
halla and starts arguing that the world
is flat and that they done so and so back
in sumach township where he was
raised well gently but firmly escort him
to the horizon and attach him to a sky-
rocket

   why not proclaim yourself autocrat
and make em all swear an oath of al-
legiance before you let em light i sug-
gested  let me be your grand vizier 
ill bet  could grand-vize em to a purple
perfection

   leave it to me he said  youd
probably get yourself beat up for noth-
ing ill manage the deal by sheer
weight of mentality and moral suasion
you go down and start the boys to razing
that jail-building this afternoon it wont
be needed in valhalla and we can use the
brick and stone in our power-house

  that same afternoon we went out to
the eastern edge of our fair city to de-
cide some question of the drainage in that
direction and on our w-ay back ran
plump into a caravan that was entering
valhalla from the north along our clas-
siest residence street

  the argonautic expedition consisted

of two weather-stained and smoky sloops
of the prairie drawn by the toughest-
looking crow-baits of horses i ever saw
standing on hoofs

  a cadaverous  looking person who
needed various shaves hair - cuts and
massages-not to mention the ordinary
ministrations of soap and water-was ma-
nipulating the strings on the forward
van and a half-grown girl wearing a
mans vest steered the destinies of the
trailer

  numerous progeny peered out through
slits and other openings in the wagon-
cover four nondescript cur dogs were
acting as convoy a coop of chickens dan-
gled beneath one wagon and an uncurried
cow lounged behind the procession at the
end of a rope

  as we approached a sun-kissed female
with a bearded wart embossing her chin
cuffed the kids into the-offing hoisted the
canvas cover and burst into conversa-
tion

   hey she said  what might a house
rent fer in this yer town of yourn  

  have you a house to let madam
honk queried blandly

   huh   she asked with suspicion

  the lord and master of the caravan
anted and sat into the game at that junc
ture he sprung it another way

   we-all air jest movin in he said 
and i noticed that his eyes werent mates
-one was blue and the other brown

   we want to git a place fer about
three dollars a month to live in he con
fided- something with enough ground
to raise chickens an a few pigs an a gyar-
den i do teamin an the old woman
does washin an sich you fellers know
of eny sich a place  

  honk was overcome with his own emo-
tions and gazed in a dazed silence i
spoke up

   i know the very place you want i
said fervently  but youll have to turn
east at this next corner as close as i
can remember its about eighty rods from
the mouth of the kaw river in kansas
city kansas i dont know of a thing
nearer

  it never touched them it was a clean
fumble

   we like the looks of this here place
pritty good the woman said  drive
on lias-these men dont know nothin
valhalla in ihe hills



that there tall one looks like a eediot
anyhow

  tarry a moment said honk with
deep solemnity as the man clucked to his
nags  lemme whisper something in
you peoples earsbefore you get into se-
rious trouble

    this town is infested with a band of
murderous ruffians who wouldnt think
nothing at all of seizing everything you
possess the minute they lay eyes on you

   fly fly
w h i  e there is
-yet time there
isnt a woman in
this town - only
wild and lawless
men hurry up

whip your steeds
to their utmost
and never
breathe freely
until youve put
many miles be-
hind you

  just then a
blast from the
hills to the west-
ward rumbled to
us

  hear that

honk said to me

thats bloody
bens pump-gun

-	i know the
roar of it hes
killed somebody
again fly stran-
ger   he urged
the pilgrim in
the wagon  you may be able
to make it yet-but i doubt it-
youve waited too long as it is

well try to keep em off you for
the sake of your kids

   two or three of the latter be-
gaivto whimper at that and the
woman got rattled alkali ike
himself showed signs of nerves

  here they come i said

 i hear em

  and i rushed to the horses
heads to shoo em around we
got the procession headed into
an alley and pointed eastward

honk bringing up the rear prod-
ding the cow and away we went

  the pursuit died away and they crept
stealthily out and trekked for afar with-
out much urging every kid under cover
and the grown-ups looking back now and
then to watch for imaginary brigands

  the man took time to ask flonk if he
had any  chawin-terbacker however
before the final parting and was cited to
me

  i surrendered all i had and told him
not to give it back he didnt

about that time
the well-drillers
struck a hundred-
barrel-a-minute
flow


the railroad mans magazine

   we lurked around behind a fuel-shed
 and watched them until the last wagon
 faded over the slope

    honk sighed with relief

    phew  he whistled  i hope
 there wont any more come like that
 bunch im wore clear out

 	 didnt you like the looks of them 
 i asked

     why thats the kind of people thatd
 picket their cow in the street and keep
 their pigs in a movable pen in the parks
 he said with bated breath as he wiped
 away the cold sweat

    in truth valhalla was looking as cute
  as could be by that time grass and trees
 were growing in the parks and along the
 streets thered been enough rain in the
 hills to start a tolerable-like puddle of
 water in our reservoir and every house
 shed and building in the town had re-
 ceived new paint and other rejuvenation
 all of which helped some

   honk fixed up his street - flushing
 scheme with its automatic attachment
 and it worked like powder in the fire
 he had his flood-gates all connected up
 with a clock and at a certain hour-mid-
 night was selected for convenience-all
 the paved streets of valhalla were de-
 luged with a sheet of whirling water
 which ran down em like a mill race and
 washed em as clean and spotless as newly
 polished brass railings

    it was supposed to open and shut itself
 and was no bother whatever all that
 had to be done was to keep the clock
 wound and set at the proper hour

    honk was considerably harassed in his
 mind for several days after the visitation
 of the two prairie schooners for fear
 wed wake up some morning and find
 that a mess of poor white trash had moved
 in during the night he suffered many
 misgivings on that score muttered in his
 sleep and harangued imaginary desecra-
 tors of valhallas exclusive environs

   he didnt become wholly reconciled
 and free from these morbid fears till i
 journeyed over to the railroad one day and
 brought back from the medicine-house
 our loquacious friend the phonograph
 which we installed in the drawing-room
 of the ten-thousand-dollar pressed-brick
 residence we were occupying at that time
 and turned it loose without restraint
 then richard was himself again

  a few doses of  he walked right in
turned around and walked right out
again and the welcome on the door-
mat was never meant for me and
honk was right side up with care

   theres nothing like a little line of
music to chirk up the downcast spirits of
a hard-thinking fellow like yours etc
he said  after listening to a few selec-
tions from the classics like  whats the
use and take back your heart i
ordered liver a man can chew his
tobacco with the relish of boyhood-eh
horace

  at last we got things in valhalla just
about as sniptious as theyll ever be short
of divine interference and so reported to
dade who was waiting for the word
honk went over and wired the details
himself direct dade promised to come
a-running with his party on a certain date
all set and honk came-back to valhalla
stepping high and wearing his oh-pitfle-
theres-nothing-to-it smirk

   they cant get away from it he
said puffing indolently at a cheroot hed
acquired somewhere  its all foregone
-nailed tied and tagged if dade
brings really truly people with money to
invest out here its all over but writing
the receipts

  it was a friday when the dade party
stormed valhalla they came in ten big
automobiles each loaded to the guards-

i mean the automobiles-and were quite
a likely looking herd of plum-seekers
there were five severely critical women
in the party whom dade confided were
wary and mightily sophisticated but had
the coin to spend if we could show the
goods

  then there were fifty or sixty fat and
foxy gents of various ages and varieties
of personal charm who were rated at all
the way from tolerably well-heeled to
double a one star plus x all took a keen
interest in everything they saw and there
wasnt much they overlooked either by
the way

  honk burst into radiant blossom and
marched proudly at the head of the
parade spendthrift of words and figures
loud in explanation of the enormous pos-
sibilities at hand-bubbling spouting
and spraying his enthusiasms right and
left i trotted along not to make any
big talk or to volunteer any rash asser-
valhalla in the hills



tions but just as a sort of corroborative
 witness if needed if honk stated that
electricity could be made and furnished
for one-eighth of a mill per watt hour
thousand feet or crate or whatever he
said couldnt it horace i was there to
nod sagely and look around as if daring
anybody to offer a bet to the contrary

valhalla made a favorable impression

envelope too which shows what a man
can do when hes warmed up honk was
a mean hog when it came to figures on
water-power after awhile they got to
palavering about factory sites and jotting
down memorandums of this that and the
other for future reference

some of them proposed to dabble in
real estate pretty promiscuously you

could see that from the way they gloated
over the residence streets from points of
vantage

  then we showed em our street-flushing
scheme and explained it called atten-
tion to our sewerage visited the artesian
well mentioned the fertility of the soil
the peerless climate the latitude longi-
tude altitude and attitude of valhalla
which made all others look like tin money
in a clearing-house succeeding which the
push went to lunch with the understand-
ing that the afternoon was to be occupied
in signing up contracts deeds franchises
and concessions smoking perfectos chew-
ing gum and exchanging attests

  there was a four-story rough-faced

on em all right our wide clean streets 
our parks lawns neat newly painted
buildings and the general air of spotless-
ness pervading everything caught em
we took the whole push all over we
showed em valhalla from every angle

  we piloted em out into the hills where
they could get perspectives and take a
look at the reclamation work honk
proved to every one of them except a
certain austere-looking young lady with
a trigonometrical forehead that he had
water-power enough within hailing dis-
tance to run-as ponderous and compli-
cated a plant as the mills of the gods
themselves

  he did it that time on the back of an

fly while there is yet time
there isnt a woman in this
town-only wild and
lawless men 


the railroad mans magazine

brick hotel building as yet untenanted
whose big dining-room was used for this
occasion

  some of the guests really enjoyed the
canned goods it was change enough to
appeal to em about the close of the
banquet honk slipped out and called one
of our henchmen-one butch poteet by
name-and told him to hot-foot it up to
the waterworks and turn on the water

   turn on the park mains butch he
said  and give us some pressure i
want to show these people what weve got
turn on the whole works we dilly-
dallied around to give butch time and
then honk proposed that everybody go
over and sit in the park for an hour or so
and enjoy a nice rest by the cascades
sure they would fine excellent idea
so we all started

  now so far as i know nobody ever
gets to be such a favorite of fortune but
what trouble wont sneak around and
smell of his trail occasionally and
trouble happened along there just about
then there we went parading up val-
hallas quiet street in the best of humors
all dade was expounding to those near-
est on the history of valhalla in his
usual effective manner

   a great and important drawback to
this country heretofore he was saying
 has been the lack of water it has been
a perplexing-bhum-problem and it
remained for us to solve it which we
have one old gentleman whose hearing
was going down the western slope didnt
quite catch the gist

   eh  he said  you say you have
solved it  how  

  at that moment a two-foot wash of
racing water danced into view fifty yards
away stretching from curb to curb of our
street and coming toward us with the
speed of a mail-train trying to make up
a lost hour dade didnt need to answer
the bunch could see

  when that young river struck our party
of investors there was a squeak or two
from the ladies and a kind of a sigh and
a heave from the male portion then-
down went mcginty

  in the twinkling of a mischievous eye
our street was a squirming mass of legs
arms and other debris shooting the rap-
ids it was heap much splash away went
the ladies merrily and here and there a

bald head bobbed up spouted and clove
the water like a porpoise

  i went down with the rest but man-
aged to port my helm and luff to the
starboard so i climbed out on the curb
and watched ye regatta there went old
honk clawing at the pavement on his
hands and knees and a large gentleman
with a parasol bore down on a skinny
man who was traveling rapidly in a
sitting position

  some managed to regain their feet but
in attempting to gallop ashore lost their
footing and reposed again in the hurrying
tide it didnt let up either butch had
 turned on the whole works

  that street-flushing scheme was the
real article it took along wheat and
tares just the same as the sheep and goats
whether they wanted to go or not made
no difference-they went

  was that outfit angered ask honk
as quick as that crowd of aquatic dis-
posers scrambled out of the souse and got
its bearings they made high jumps and
sprinkled the side streets for the automo-
biles and they didnt listen to any ex-
planations or excuses either not them

  it was back to tire taxicab for them
and steer for the land where streets are
flushed by the time-honored method of a
section of hose on the corner fire-plug
dade bobbed up out of an alley about the
last of all he had made the longest race
of any but one but he was so waterlogged
that he let the guy beat him back to the
home base

  dade was too full for utterance he
tried to rally em around the old flag
but there was nothing didding so he
busied himself with coughing up large
chunks of wet water and exploding peri-
odically like a gasoline engine with a bum
sparker

  with deep dejection honk stood with
his wayward feet splashed by his drip
and watched them sail away some of
them even went so far as to-shake sand-
caked fists at us over the backs of their
cars as they left many bareheaded with
their scanty hair drying awry in the sun

   i thought these capitalists were great
hands for a plunge i remarked with a
watery leer 

   come on honk said  lets go
find that butch i want to whisper some-
thing to him with a club
heraldry of the
railroads

by george foxhall

flags emblems and coats of arms are by no means the product of a
desire for useless ornamentation when they were first invented they
served a remarkably useful purpose of course it is a purpose that no
longer exists but devices of this character still serve a purpose as useful
among the thousands of public-serving corporations where names are com-
plex numerous and in many instances similar a well-chosen device is often
more distinctive and better known than the name itself

the romance of the continent - covering steel tracks as it is em-
blazoned upon the scutcheons of time-tables
posters and rolling stock

n the old days when the
worlds history was in
the making certain gen-
tlemen of amiable tem-
per went w an dering
around spiking each oth-
er upon the ends of long spears this
was doubtless a very modish and con-
venient form of amusement but as the
pastime increased and the gentlemen
were led to clothe themselves in iron-
ware it became very hard to distinguish
the person one wished to spike from the
people who because of affection or pol-
icy he might desire to leave unspiked

  that is why the custom of carrying a
bannerette or an heraldic device painted
with more or less art upon the owners
shield or helmet came into effect at
first it was a rather happy-go-lucky sort of
business and the method of deciding what
particular device should be adopted was
left pretty much to a happy chance

  for instance some gal-
lant gentleman is wandering
along the highway at dead
of night he comes across
a mortal enemy and gal-
lantly removes his head
from his shoulders with a

long two-handed sword posterity
is informed of this fact by an at-
tractive engraving of a dripping
head or beneath which is a cleaving
sword argent on a field gules and
there you have a thoroughly well-
made design ready for your descendants
to use forever and ever

  the writer may add incidentally that
the terms or argent and gules are her-
aldic terms of which he is as blissfully
ignorant as he is blissfully indifferent
therefore if some student of antiques
should find in the heraldry of these de-
signs something to take exception to he is
doubtless quite right

making family decorations

  by and by however people quit spiking
each other and sawing off heads for the
sake of getting decorative family orna-
ments but the same old custom of identi-
fying oneself by painted de-
vices survives whether it
was because of the good
start it got or because it re-
minded humanity of its for-
mer pleasant primitive glo-
ries we do not know
g

the railroad mans magazine

                    we doubt how-
 ever whether any-
 thing bloodthirsty
 survives with the
 idea as we are sure
 that none of the
 well-conducted corporations who have
 been at great pains and considerable in-
 genuity to devise attractive designs have
 anything in their minds except the de-
 vout desire to serve a more or less blood-
 thirsty public

   every reader is familiar with the her-
 aldry of the sea-at least we like to tell
 every reader that he is though doubtless
 he is not  but anyhow he knows that
 such a thing exists the flags of the
 various merchant lines as well as the
 national flags war flags and ranking flags
 of the great navies of the world have been
 the subject for endless journalistic effort

   but there is a heraldry as important
 under the devices and banners of which
 flies at terrific speed wealth of treasures
 and lives many times in excess of that
 beneath all the banners that cover the face
 of the waters perhaps its significance
 is not as keen but its symbolism is often
 as deep and as romantic

swastika of the rail

   in glancing through the field of rail-
 road heraldry the first place historically
 must be given to the emblem of the st
 louis rocky mountain and pacific rail-
 way company this emblem has prac-
 tically got all mottoes devices or
 designs enacted or constructed
 by our spike - sticking friends
 beaten all the way round the
 world when it comes to age

   the main ground of this de-
 vice is a swastika the swastika
 was doubtless invented by some
 friend of the great-grandfather
 of the gentleman who built the cheops
 pyramid or the smiling sphinx or the
 hanging gardens of babylon or the
 tower of babel anyhow it seems to
 have been found in every part of the
 world and at every time that history can
 put a tag on and some that she cannot
 even if she does not admit it

   the swastika on a black flag with a
 circle surrounding it bearing the words
  the rocky mountain route is the

 emblem of this road

 it probably typifies
 the age - enduring
 strength and rich-
 ness of the coun-
 try through which
 the road passes as well as hints at its
 history the swastika having been one of
 the earliest decorative designs of the
 american indian tribes

an emblem and a religion

   there is so much to say about the
 northern pacifics peculiar trade-mark
 that the difficulty is in selecting things to
 be said in the short space we wish to
 occupy so as to give a full idea of the
 large meaning of the symbol for an-
 tiquity this trade-mark runs the swastika
 a pretty good second

   as nearly as it can be traced it origi-
 nated as a symbol in the abstruse mind
 of a young chinese named chow lien ki
 this young man was an ardent lover of
 nature and in the course of his rambles
 he discovered a cave of peculiar forma-
 tion

   he used a modification of the outline
 of this cave to illustrate a system of phil-
 osophy established by full hi a chinese
 philosopher who lived some three or four
 thousand years before christ the sym-
 bol which at first seems very omplicated
 is in reality exceedingly simple

    if you describe a circle and ride a line
          through the diameter then describe two
          semicircles having the center
          one-quarter of the distance-and
          the circumference touching the
          center of the larger circle the
          semicircles facing in opposite di-
          rections you will have the sim-
          ple outline of the great monad

           the system of philosophy is
 stated as follows the illim-
 itable produced the great extreme  the
 great extreme produced the two prin-
 ciples  the two principles produced the
 four figures and from the four fig-
 ures were developed what the chinese call
 the eight diagrams of full hi in  bc

taken from the korean flag

   this is the origin of the symbbl but it
 is not from this source that the northern

new york

central

lines

w
heraldry of the railroads



    pacific adopted it to quote from the
    history of the trade-mark as published by
    the company

       the design was discovered and adapt-
    ed to its present use in  mr e h
    mchenry and mr charles s fee then
    as now the chief engineer and general
    passenger and ticket agent of the com-
    pany respectively are principally to be
    credited with jts discovery and adoption

       the northern pacific was
    in search of a trade-mark

    many designs had been consid-
    ered and rejected mr mchen-
    ry while visiting the korean
    exhibit at the worlds fair
    was struck with a geometric
    design that appeared on the
    korean flag

        it was simple yet effective-plain yet
    striking at once the idea came to him
    that it was just the symbol for the long-
    sought-for trade-mark with but slight
    modification it lent itself readily to the
    purpose

the aristocrat of emblems

      another design the foundation of which
    can do pretty well in the matter of having
    attained years of discretion is the  f
    fv significant of the great flyer of the
    chesapeake and ohio between new york
    and cincinnati this emblem is a product
    of local pride and as the streak of yellow
    glory flashes herself brilliantly through
    the vivid virginia sunlight the first
    families of virginia in particular and in
    general look upon her with patriarchal
    pride and think of the old days when to
    be of the first families of virginia meant
    to be a prince in the state-if such a thing
    as a prince can exist in a democratic com-
    monwealth

       in short the origin of the symbol  f
fv or to quote the full title of the
train  fast-flying virginian is a com-
plimentary reminder
by its initials of the
phrase  first fam-
ilies of virginia
in that section of
the country before
and shortly after the
civil warthis term
was so much used
and it had so much

	l  

meaning that the abbreviation  ffv
was quite common

   when wishing to attract the attention
of the public to the first solid vestibuled
electric-lighted dining-car sleeping-car
and coach through train operating be-
tween the east and the west mr h w
fuller then general passenger agent of
the road decided that the surest method
was to use some form which would abbre-
viate into these famous initials
 ffv

  some of the emblems adopt-
ed by railroads are very sim-
ple apt and obvious such as
for instance that of the read-
ing this design is a black dia-
mond with the lettering  the
reading  in white characters on it
it need not be explained that this is
significant of the anthracite territory
through which the philadelphia and
reading a great coal-road operates

   the lehigh valley has a similar signifi-
cance except that its black diamond bear-
ing the white letters  lehigh valley is
placed upon a bright red flag this was
originally designed by the former general
manager of the lehigh valley transpor-
tation company which operated a line of
boats upon the great lakes and was
adopted as the private signal of the boats
 that line

   these boats formed the lake line of the
lehigh valley railroad company and
were engaged principally in transporting
anthracite coal from buffalo to st paul
and milwaukee the idea of this gentle-
man was to use the red color as indicating
the color of the flame peculiar to anthra-
cite the black diamond to represent the
coal itself while the letters  lehigh val-
ley were shown on the diamond in white
to indicate the cleanliness and purity of
the road this emblem was adopted by
the lehigh valley railroad company
about the year 

the emblem of the
wabash railroad
consists of the word
wabash in white
characters on a
black square on a red
flag intended to car-
ry the conviction to
the observing eye that
the wabash  is the


the railroad mans magazine

banner road the emblem at first was
shown in the glare of a headlight instead
of on the banner but as the wabash grew
okjer and began to look around and see
what a big-sized boy it was becoming it
decided that it could just about show its
tail-lights to anything on the line so it
threw the headlight out and became the
banner road

admiration or derision

  everybody knows that the new york
chicago and st louis railroad is the
 nickel plate very few people know
why personally the writer has two
stories why and as they are both good
ones he prefers to believe them doth  not
because of any similarity that exists be-
tween them but because he got them both
from very high au-
thority and both of
them were doubtless
told in perfect good
faith

  the reader will
probably make a
choice the writer
has too much admi-
ration -for the veracity of everybody the
first story relates how early in the con-
struction of the line in  great rivalry
was manifested by several of the larger
towns in ohio in efforts to secure the loca-
tion of the road

  among these rival towns was nonvalk
ohio the editor of the norwalk chroni-
cle was a member of the connnittee having
in charge negotiations for the location
through that city and when the final de-
cision to run the road via bellevue was
reached this editor in a spirit of disap-
pointment stated in an editorial tihat
 after all they were not losing very much
as it was nothing more than a nickel-
plated road anyhow

  as our informant comments from this
remark made in a spirit of derisibn was
designed for this line
the distinctive ap-
pellation whereby it
is known all over the
world

the other story
that we have at a
later date casts we
regret to say some

aspersions upon the
veracity of all rival
story - tellers among
whom doubtless was
our o w n faithful
chronicler

  this informant
says  the popular
sobriquet of the new
york chicago and st louis railroad
has furnished the subject for the weaving
of many and varying tales each with more
or less foundation in fact as suited the
purpose of the dreamy narrator of cor-
ner-grocery legend or the resourceful and
visionary space-writer doing time on the
sunday blanket-sheet

  this mild ridicule rather hurts the
feelings of the present writer for he has
told the first story -himself effectively
amid deeply touching scenes many many
times and at o much per our cold-
blooded critic and informant tells us that
in place of our own delicately constructed
little narrative we should all the time
have been relating the following bald
facts which while they have many points
of similarity with our own bold narrative
lack the touching dramatic atmosphere
thrown in by the bitter disappointment of
the norwalk editor

   we are told that this editor was actually
building up the enthusiasm of -liis fellow
citizens amid the very pleasant rivalry of
the ohio towns and that in the issue of
april  s of the norwalk chronicle
he spoke of the road its glittering pros-
pects the brilliant possibilities opened up
for the cities through which it operated
together with the gilt-edged character of
its financial backing and characterized
the institution as  the nickel-plated road
the term having been intended as showing
a bright and exceptional attribute of the
enterprise

the domestic katy

  the emblem of the missouri kansas
and texas is also in the form of a nick-
name  katy and is doubtless better
known among railroaders as  katy  than
by its longer and more dignified appella-
tion the name springs from the fact
that the missouri kansas and texas was
prior to s operated as part of the
gould southwestern system being known
heraldry of the railroads



at the time as the
kansas and texas
division this among
trainmen was nat-
urally abbreviated to
k and t and
thus to  k-t and
therefrom by this
easy step into the
touching homelike and affectionate cog-
nomen  katy it is very domestic

the  keystone  system

  of course everybody knows why the
pennsylvania railroad adopted the trade-
mark of the keystone and of course
everybody is wrong-at least they are a
little shy of facts the key stone as an
emblem of the pennsylvania is the result
of a westward movement among emigrants
and among the presidents of the state of
pennsylvania in 

  mr-thomas e watt who was at that
time district passenger agent at pitts-
burgh in preparing some advertising for
the purpose of influencing this business
suggested the use of the key stone his
suggestion as carried out at that time
included with the keystone the headlight
of a locomotive and the rays of light
from the headlight illumined the reading
matter on the flyer

  mr l p farmer then general pas-
senger agent was struck by the effective-
ness of the idea and suggested that the
keystone would be most suitable as the
regular emblem for the pennsylvania
railroad

canadas national railway

  one of the most picturesque of railroad
trade-marks is that of the canadian road
the intercolonial railway this device
is a moose head looking through a double
circle on which appears the words  the
fast line the peoples railway this
was first used in  and in  with
the canadian arms was made a combina-
tion device indicating the government
ownership of the railway

  the moose head was adopted by this
railway because no other railway in the
country passes through such an extensive
stretch of country so definitely recognized
as the home of the moose both the moose

head and the coat of arms appear on the
folder but the moose head is the recog-
nized trade-mark of the road

santa fes repentant moods

  perhaps no railroad has changed its
trade-mark as often as the santa fe the
trade-mark adopted in  is described
by the santa fe employees magazine as
looking like a cake of soap with the words
 santa fe route  across it

  the trade-mark adopted in  is very
gorgeous but is a product of the very
worst pun that man was ever compelled to
survive under the main portion of the
device is the western hemisphere with
a lion standing on top and the words
 santa fe route  scrolled beneath

cance of this work of
art as  the big line

the present trade-

davis then industrial
commissioner and mr j j byrne at 
present assistant passenger traffic mana-
ger used what they said was a silver dol-
lar but what was doubtless a poker chip
to draw a circle and within the circle they
drew a cross this device is not so ornate
as the one of  but it stirs up less
animosity against the designers

first railroad trade-marks

  but the santa fe line pales into insig-
nificance in the matter of ornate design
when compared to the old trade-mark of
the chicago northwestern it was per-
haps the first design adopted by any rail-
road as a trade-mark

  the company therefore had nothing
to guide it and the result looks like hai-
leys comet striking
a palm - grove the
only thing it leaves
whole is a map of
the northwestern
route and about the
only thing we can be
sure of is the state-

trates the richest and

sin minnesota dakota and northern

was very effective

  one is prepared to forgive even the
northwestern however for
turning to a simplicity just as
pronounced and effective as
that of the santa fe the
trade-marks now used are a
circle with a diagonal hand across in
black with the words  northwestern
line  in white and a square of black
with the words  chicago and northwest-
ern railway  in white relief

  the maple leaf of the chicago great
western railroad has an origin all the
more interesting because the man who de-
signed it received one hundred dollars for
the job in  mr busenbark general
passenger and ticket agent of ithe chicago
st paul and kansas city railway as the
road was then called offered a prize of
one hundred dollars to any ticket agent in
the united states who could suggest the
most appropriate trade-mark for his com-
pany

  the result was that mr r g thomp-
son who is now ticket-agent for
the wabash at fort wayne in-
diana-or was some time ago-
sent in the maple - leaf design
with the chicago st paul and
kansas city railway system
sketched into the veins of the
leaf the road has carried this
design ever since

  very few railway emblems or
trade-marks can boast of a better known or
more distinguished designer than that of
the atlantic coast line in january 
colonel a pope who was then located at
wilmington as general passenger agent
devised the present emblem a double cir-
cle with the words atlantic coast line
in red in the center and the names of the
states through which it passes between
the circles

  the atlantic coast line informs us

that there is no special history connected
with the trade-mark we think that most
old railroad men especially in the south
will agree that it is sufficient history for
any trade-mark to have been designed by
such a famous railroad man as colonel
pope

is it a clover-leaf

  the emblem of the toledo st louis
and western railroad popularly known
as  the clover-leaf is a standing
monument to the native
shrewdness of an irishman
this irishman mr james m
quigley was the president of
the road in s

  when the track was being changed
from narrow gage to standard the com-
pany wanted an emblem and the presi-
d e n t suggested the
shamrock the direct-
ors held up their
hands in indignation
and mr quigley beat
a strategic retreat and
smilingly suggested a
clover-leaf

  the result is that till this day nobody
knows whether the original emblem was
a shamrock or the clover-leaf the writer
has friends who say they know the differ-
ence but as he does not know himself he
does not believe them

  in the matter of heraldry the chicago
and alton goes the whole hog
this companys design is real
dyed-in-the-wool medieval her-
aldry the basic design is a
shield surmounted by a very
uncomfortable - looking helmet
which is in turn surmounted
by an electric headlight with
wings it is very awe - in-
spiring

  on the-shield are three links placed tri-
angularly and indicating the fact that the
chicago and alton links the three great
cities of the middle west-chicago st
louis and kansas city surrounding all
this design is an artistic pattern of leaves
and surmounting the whole in a cloud of
steamevidently coming from behind the

evolution of the rio grande

  the trade-mark of the denver and rio
grande was composed and evolved as the
writer is informed by its
evolver after much cutting and
pasting and printing and the
exercise of considerable art and
more ingenuity from a number
of designs submitted by rail-
way printing-houses at his re-
quest

  the route is well known in
its advertising as  the scenic
line of the world most of the designs
submitted were curiously enough formed
by the head of a locomotive-boiler some
with one kind of ornamentation and
some with another the combined re-
sult of all these designs is the front end
of a locomotive-boiler with the words
 the scenic line of
the world  on a
banner beneath it a
mountain scene on the
steam-chest and the
name of the company
surrounding the view

  these prints are made in sizes standard-
ized to united states coin such as the
dime size the dollar size and the half-
dollar size etc this trade-mark has been
used since  and every
piece of advertising or sta-
tionery has had the trade-mark
on since last year

roads of the continent the ca-

records regarding it were destroyed by
fire some years ago

  the widely known trade-mark of the

route

of em-
above a

railroad made its first appearance on the
margin of a newspaper and was evolved
from the original type arrangement by
the late mr c t hempstead who was
general passenger and ticket agent at the
time he was traveling to new haven
from lyndbrook when he hit upon the
design and drew it on the margin of his
newspaper for several years it was used
in type form but the emblem has now
become a recognized feature of
the railroad and it is planned
to make much more extensive
use of it than heretofore

  probably no railroad em-
blem has quite as much his-
torical and legendary interest
surrounding it as has the san
pedro los angeles and salt
lake railroad known as  the
salt lake route  and  the arrow head
line

  the design is taken from the phenome-
non on the arrow head mountain near
san bernardino california one of cali-
fornias geological wonders

  on the face of this mountain and over-
looking the whole of san bernardino val-
ley stands out in startling clearness an
immense arrow head caused by a forma-
tion geologically different from the rest
of the mountain it consists chiefly of
disintegrated white quartz and light gray
granite and is covered by a growth of
short white sage and weeds this lighter
vegetation shows up in sharp contrast to
the dark green growth of surrounding
chaparral and greasewood

  by actual measurement the
arrow head is  feet long
and  feet wide covering
an area of seven and one-hall
acres

  the legends regarding it are
numerous covering a period
undated past to as recently
perhaps the most appealing -
and pleasantest of the legends is that of
the coahuia indians

lowing effect

    thus for many years they lived un-
  happy and in constant fear until at last
  the persecutions could no longer be en-
  dured and at command of their chief
  the tribesmen gathered in council for
  the purpose of calling upon the god of
  peace to assist and direct them to an-
  other country where they might acquire
  a quiet home land

    impressive incantations and ceremo-

  man now being a gentle people they
  found special favor with the great
  spirit by whom they were directed to
  travel westward and instructed that
  they would be guided to their new
  home by a fiery arrow for which they
  must be constantly watching

    accordingly the tribe started upon
  the journey and one moonless night
  when the camp sentries had been posted
  with usual injunctions to be watchful
  there appeared across the vault
  of heaven a blazing arrow
  which took a course westward
  settling upon the mountain
  where the shaft was consumed
  in flame but the head embed-

  as far as national interest is concerned
 the baltimore and ohio will probably
 always take precedence in tlie railroad
 world for the reason that it was the first
 incorporated steam railroad in the coun-
 try

emblem of the first route

    its emblem is peculiarly fitted for
  the road possessing this distinction and
  besides it has a particularly artistic and

distinguished effect
especially in colors

the dome of the
n ational capitol
forms the ground-
work for the em-
blem and a ribbon
encircles it with the
words  the balti-
more and ohio railroad  and in the
upper rim of the circle the words  all
roads via washington there seems
to be no particular history attached to
this emblem apart from its unconscious
significance

the lion mountains remorse

   the missouri pacific and iron moun-
tain is another road that repented of its
misdeeds as a punster some years ago it
was the proud possessor of a trade-mark
originated by a gentleman whom we will
not expose which consisted of a large
steers head with the words  steer for
the mountain- placed between its horns
we understand that the discriminating
steer ultimately tossed the pun off the
paper and it has not been heard from
since the present trade-mark of the
company is a large red seal with the
words  missouri pacific iron
mountain  in white block let-
ters on the face of it

  the kansas city southern
has  specific trade-mark but
it uses as a sort of motto the
words  straight as the crow

time ago it had what might be called a
trade-mark for a very short time it was
a fifteen-inch rule with a map of the

one thousand miles of track that could get
a map of its road on a rule

from an old freight-car

  shortly after mr e l lomax gen-
eral passenger-agent of the union pacific
railroad company entered the service of
that road at omaha as assistant general
passenger-agent the late mr t j potter
the vice-president and general manager
of the union pacific asked him to get up
a trade-mark for the union pacific rail-
road that would convey an idea of pa-
triotic association with the government
using the national colors-red white and
blue

  mr lomax during his search for
something suitable saw a shield on an old
freight-car which was altogether different
from anything that he had ever seen in
the shape of shields and it occurred to
him that with proper changes
a good trade-mark could be
worked out of it

  he had about a hundred
sketches of different forms of
shields drawn and finally se-
lected one that did not conflict
with any other shield national or oth-
erwise of which he could get a record

body widened and a
point drawn at the
bottom and thirteen
stripes alter-
nately red and white
shown in the body
and a blue back-
ground with white
letters at the top

this was at once approved and adopted

  later mr lomax wanted to work in
the words  the overland route as
that was the old name of the union pa-
cific and this was done in the shape of a
legend at the bottom and outside of the
shield but later he concluded to show
this in the center of the body of the shield
within a narrow parallelogram and a
ring then he added at the bottom of
the shield  worlds pictorial line
which was later eliminated

  when the shield was first worked out
the parallelogram extended diagonally
through the middle of the shield from the
right at the top to the left at the bot-
tom this however was changed later
to run from left to right

  the time consumed in working out the
various changes in accordance with ideas
which occurred from time to time was
in the neighborhood of one year

  these brief descriptions do
not cover by any means all
the interesting or romantic de-
vices of railroad heraldry but
they are sufficient to show the
reader that there is being built

nificant system of emblems and trade-

pierre a young frenoh-canadian with indian blood in his veins while hunting and
trapping in the canadian woods rescues anne marie a young indian girl and her
old father whose canoe has been upset and demolished by a moose father and daughter
are badly injured pierre takes them to his tent and cares for them but the old indian is
so seriously hurt that he dies and pierre is left with the girl on his hands a half-breed
and an indian appear at the camp it turns out that this half-breed simon who was the
husband of anne maries sister but who through his brutality has killed his wife is in
love with the girl and tries to make pierre give her up this pierre refuses to do and
the girl and he scheme to escape in the canoe it seems impossible and finally anne
marie whose injuries are very painful endeavors to make simon swear on the grave of
her father that he will protect her and take her to the home of her cousin antoine simon
promises but refuses to swear he insults pierre and a fight ensues in which pierre suc-
ceeds in felling the half-breed and with the help of the girl binds him anne marie after
damaging simons canoe in such a way that it will take some hours to mend helps pierre
and the indian to pack their canoe and she and pierre start up the river leaving the indian
who has shown very little interest in the happenings to return and release simon

  due north where he watched the river
there was an uncanny aspect of darkness
relieved only by the few faint streaks
upon the water some old pines that had
been blasted by lightning stood like
gaunt watching giants just limned in
black upon the dark sky the white-
trunked aspens and the whiter birches
gave clear notes that stood out upon the
background of blackish green of the
hemlocks spruces and firs and the
whole as ever in the north looked weird
full of many portents pregnant with
perils yet imbued with a somber great-
ness and strength that lent a glory to the
world of cold and hunger

  to his left the water was swiftly
passing deep but foam-llecked over the
dark surface extending to the cliffs of
the shore that was only just becoming
visible faintly suggested like some vis-
ionary land

the strange beliefs that had arisen in in-

chapter v

          a battle of giants

         was very early when pierre
         awoke paddy had nestled up
         against the girl as soon as
         his master moved he opened
         one eye wagged his tail and
         finding himself perfectly com-
         fortable remained where he was

  it was quite chilly and still rather
dark as the young man threw off his
blankets and made his way to the upper
end of the little island there he sat
upon a rock among the little scrubby firs
and spruces growing in the scanty soil
that had gathered in the crannies between
the boulders gazing intently up-stream

  to his right the sky was becoming
clearer with ithe bluish - green tint that
comes before the sunrise and yellow pen-
cils of light appeared and disappeared
so faint and hazy that they could hard-
ly be appreciated
a heart of the north



that the generations passed and gone had
peopled the wilderness with windegoos
and things of evil and had seen in the
dark brown waters river men and wom-
en whom it was ill-luck to molest and
had filled the forest with spirits of the
wild things the hunted

  they hung the skulls of animals upon
saplings cleaned of bark to propitiate
their ghosts and begged pardon of the
bears moose and beavers they killed

  but the sky was growing lighter new
tints succeeded one another in the sky
and things could be seen more plainly
an old shell-drake left the rushes on the
edge of the mainland to the right fol-
lowed by her brood of nearly grown
ducklings a couple of bitterns came
along in slow ungainly flight looking
for fishing-grounds now and then a
fish leaped his rise making great rings
upon the water

  pierre began to shiver with the cold
of the early morning which can be dis-
pelled only by a brisk camp-fire and a
cup of hot tea the world was so still
that he was startled when quite noise-
lessly anne marie appeared beside him
paddy had reluctantly arisen and could
be heard foraging about in the brush
he must have caught a glimpse of some
fleeing squirrel or muskrat for he gave
a sharp bark

   bon jour must tie the dog said the
girl

   bonjour anne marie im afraid
he wont like it much still i suppose
that if those fellows pass by and see him
on the island it wont quite agree with
your plans

  so he called the dog and with his
tump-line tied him near the place where
they had slept then in a great crack be-
tween two titanic rocks he lighted a tiny
fire and quickly boiled the kettle as
soon as this was done he put out the fire
and went back to where anne marie had
taken his post as a sentinel to watch the
river

   go back and eat he told her

  have you had your tea already
she asked

   why no  not yet go on and come
back when you have finished

  she was about to object but he made
a somewhat impatient gesture and she
turned away in silence and left him

  she had been gone but a few minutes
when far up the river his eye was caught
by some hardly discernible thing that no
one unaccustomed to the woods could
have noticed it was a bit of a moving
speck faint against the dark background
of the rocks but he knew at once what
it was

  he ran back to where the girl was sit-
ting

   theyre coming  he cried

  he pounced upon his gun and took it
out of the cover that had been put over
it for the night the magazine was kept
full and he had several cartridges in his
pockets

  anne marie had risen quietly to-
gether they returned to the place from
which they had watched iving down
among the low bushes and hidden by the
rocks and the saplings they had no fear
of being seen

   the water is deep on that side they
will keep close to the shore the nearest
place where they will pass is far
yes replied pierre it is all of a
couple of hundred yards

   too far to shoot and make sure she
commented

   yes though i could hit the canoe
all right but im not going to start
tlie shooting

   they will go on as far as the next
portage it is ten miles down and they
will look for our tracks then they will
hunt carefully to see whether we have
passed by the other shore or farther up
in the woods

   and when they find nothing they
will come back added pierre

   yes but they will be very careful
if they are sure they have passed us
they will know that we saw them go by
their conversation stopped and they
watched the canoe which was nearing
them swiftly it kept in the shadowy
water at the foot of the eastern shore
and came along without a sound simon
was at the stern and the indian in front
and like machines their brawny arms
were driving the birchen shell

  pierre was a good enough canoeman
to be able to realize that those two were
masters of their craft

  shortly before reaching a place just
opposite their little island they stopped
paddling and the watchers felt their


the railroad mans magazine

hearts beating a little faster but the two
men only changed paddling sides and
shifted their positions ever so slightly
and then went by the island farther
down and yet farther

  when pierre and the girl reached the
lower end of the island they just saw
the men disappear around a far turn of
the river

  anne marie went back to their little
camp followed by pierre and let paddy
loose to his delirious joy

   he can run now she said

  pierre who had not yet eaten began
his breakfast the tea was cold but he
warmed it up again and drank the bitter
stuff with no thought that it was any-
tiling but hot and tasty

   whats the next thing to be done
anne marie he asked

   we can stay here or we can start
at once she replied  there is a place
farther on at the rapids where there are
many rocks we might be able to hide
ourselves and the canoe there and if
they return and do not see us we will
start down and hurry off while they are
hunting for us farther up

   it seems to me that we might just as
well stay here and do the same thing
said pierre

    yes we are better hidden here an-
swered the girl but it is the only is-
land on the river between these portages
they will suspect every such likely place
they might hide and watch it then
they would follow as soon as we started
or if they had made sure that we were
here they might come it night

   the dog would bark suggested
pierre

   yes but it would be we two against
the two of them and a fight some one
will be killed it would be a fight very
near where their guns are as good as
yours we had better go

  so once again they packed their things
and were floating down the swift river
but this time pierre kept the gun beside
him and the girl held her paddle ready
to help in case of need

  she sat in the bow with her back
turned to pierre keenly watching the ex-
panse before her and he to his surprise
caught himself noticing how well poised
the little head was upon her slender neck

  he dug his paddle in the water vi-

ciously feeling very fit and well and in
less than half an hour they reached a
broad rapid place where the water was
split into scores of little torrents by the
boulders that everywhere dotted the
stream

  from a high cliff on the left shore
tumbled a tiny waterfall that splashed
into the river and a jumble of great
rocks near this offered opportunities for
concealment

   thats the place anne marie it
will be easy to hide there it looks all
right

   no she answered   the waterfrom
that little fall is very cold they will go
and drink there the other shore

  so the canoe was pushed over to the
other side perhaps a hundred and fifty
yards- across and pierre pulled it be-
hind some great flat boulders paddy
to his great chagrin was not allowed to
wade ashore and his indignation knew
 bounds when his master with a piece
of string made a muzzle for him so that
he could not bark

  in a minute however after being well
scolded he desisted from his attempts to
remove it and settled down sulkily in
the bottom of the canoe

   i dont think we are very well hid-
den here anne -marie objected the
young man

   not very well but when they come
up the current is strong and they will
have to use their poles and pay much
attention to their canoe

   they will pass near the other side
to go by the little waterfall for cold
water then they will start on again
and as soon as they get round the bend
we will shoot down through the quick
water

  they will go on up-stream hunt
around for a day or so and make up
their minds that we have given them the
slip maskoush wants to go on with their
trip they have not much time to get
to the trapping - grounds before cold
weather so they will soon give it up and
go on up the river

   but the manouan river is the real
road for them so that they may come
down to the forks

   yes she replied  we must go
fast now if they decide to go by the
manouan they will have to return to
a heart of the north



their camp and ill have to make many
journeys over each carry we can go
faster

    well i hope it will work all right
said pierre

  they waited long both peeping from
behind the great rock that sheltered
them upon its top in one place grew
a few straggling blueberry bushes which
in times of flood must often have been
covered with water for they did not look
prosperous on their slignt foothold

  the canoe was partly in the water that
passed boiling but very shallow under
it and was held in place by the stern
which they had lifted a little and
wedged between two rocks a push
would send them flying down the rapid
water and out of sight in a minute

  the indian girls eyes were riveted
down-stfeam she was motionless ancu
untiring as pierre watched her he be-
thought himself of the behavior of wild
things in hiding he had many a time-
seen a wounded black duck concealed in
weeds and rushes or rabbits frozen into
immobility while a dog or a fox was puz-
zling out a tangled trail

  he had noted all manner of beasts
endeavoring to escape observation and
now this child of the grand nord re-
vealed the attributes of the hunted things
of the wilderness the tincture of the
same blood that was in his own veins
had to a slight extent bestowed upon
him some of those traits but he realized
that in him they were less marked

  his glance was diverted from time to
time he could not help following the
flight of a shrieking kingfisher or looking
at the leap of a fish in the rapid water
and his attention was taken by some fin-
gerling chubs or a band of ninnowg that
swam by the big rock in the shade of the
canoe

  he felt that the truly wild man or
beast whether hunter or hunted observes
everything except that which is of no
importance and that at certain times
every faculty they possess becomes con--
centrated upon the one thing that means
life or death

   ill never be a good indian he said
to himself as-he realized that he had
once more allowed his thoughts to wan-
der notwithstanding the fact  that over
there down the river were two men one

indifferent enough probably but the oth-
er hungering for his blood and searching
for him

  yet he felt a certain exultation that
was mingled with the anxiety of this
time there was sport in- it it was a
contest a game of high stakes that was
being played and he was not conscious
of any real fear

  of a sudden the life appealed to him
strongly he felt that he had an in-
herited place in the great north that he
was of it that it called to him and
thrilled every fiber of his being and that
every hour spent in the forest bound him
more strongly to its greatness

  an hour passed by and then another
until the sun was at midday and still
anne marie remained motionless her
feet in the canoe her arms resting upon
the great rock over which she watched

  pierre had become cramped and shift-
ed his position a little from time to time
while paddy was lying still apparently
understanding that something unusual
was taking place

  he had stopped rubbing his muzzle
with his paws to rid himself of the en-
cumbrance and was asleep most of the
time

  then anne marie suddenly pointed to
a blue heron that was coming toward
them with long wings beating slowly and
his snaky neck turning from side to side
as he observed the surroundings

   maybe they are coining she whis-
pered   the heron does not often fly at
this time of day

  before reaching them the great bird
swerved a little checked his flight and
went down among some rushes that grew
on the bank perhaps sixty yards away
where the rapid water entered the pool

   i wish he had not gone down there
said the girl

   you are right assented pierre  if
they come up they will surely scare him
out of there and if he passes over us and
sees us he will show them where we are

  anne marie nodded

   pick up a stone she told him  and
send him away

  pierre picked up a few stones from
the bed of the stream but before throw-
ing them he looked keenly down-stream
again at once he crouched low in the
canoe


the railroad mans magazine

   theyre coming both said at the
same time

  at the foot of the rapids where the
winding river formed a long sinuous
ribbon they had caught sight of a mov-
ing object near the right bank

   only my head showed above the
rock he whispered  they could not
have seen me

  the girl nodded and pierre worked
the cartridge into the barrel of his rifle

   i see them again said the girl
 they are coming around the little point
they travel fast i wish that big bird
was away he is an evil thing

   yes hes a windegoo said pierre

  anne marie crossed herself she did
not like the mention of the indian evil
spirits name at such a time

  now and then the canoe would lie-
come lost to view but when it reappeared
it was always a good deal nearer they
were clinging to the shore

  simon was ahead this time he was
in the best place for careful observation
finally they reached the swift water at
the foot of the pool and the half-breed
arose and took a long look while the in-
dian with his paddle dug into the bot-
tom of the river held the canoe in place
then he squatted again and they drove
their craft into the boiling water

  but a few yards were covered before
they had to take to their poles discard-
ing the paddles

  suddenly the blue heron with a clatter
of wings arose and came up-stream in a
course that would bring him directly to-
ward the two that were hiding a few
sweeps of his pinions and he was over
them as they held their breath he sud-
denly rose in the air with a cry and
changed his course

  simon and the indian were then nearly
opposite them shaping their course to-
ward the little waterfall pierre and the
girl saw them pause at once their poles
ground among the rocks at the bottom of
the rushing water 

  for a few moments they spoke excited-
ly and the half-breed still holding his
pole firmly with one hand shaded his
eyes with the other and looked in their
direction they were well hidden and
he could see nothing but he pointed to-
ward the rocks and began pushing the
canoe in their direction

   the gun exclaimed the girl  it
is his life now or ours

   i cant kill a man that way retorted
pierre  theyre coming to see what
scared the heron im going to show my-
self it is time

  he rose in the canoe showing his head
and shoulders above the rock with the
gun pointed at simon

   stop or i shoot  he called loudly

  the men were evidently somewhat
taken by surprise they stopped poling
and two or three violent words werfc ut-
tered they wereat a distinct disadvan-
tage standing up in their canoe which a
wrong move would upset

  pierre was almost entirely concealed
and had his rifle ready while their
weapons were lying in the bottom of their
canoe which began to drop back

   keep on up-stream or ill kill you 
shouted pierre who did not want them
to get below him again

  simon shook his fist at him but obeyed
realizing that some part of his body was
constantly seen by pierre in the notched
sight of his gun and that at this short
distance he could not be missed

  the iron-shod poles rattled again on
the stones at the bottom of the river
they disappeared around a bend while
a supreme contempt came into the half-
breeds mind for the man who had held
his life in his hands and had been too
stupid to shoot

   he will land and try to get at us
from the bushes cried the girl  vite
parlous

  the bend in the river beyond which
the men had disappeared was hardly a
hundred and fifty yards off and haste
was necessary but the canoe was
jammed rather hard at the stern between
the two rocks and pierre had to jump
overboard and lift it clear

  paddy seeing his master leap out pro-
ceeded to follow his example glad to stir
after his long rest but he slipped on
the wet surface of the tiny rock upon
which he had sprung and fell in the quick
water

  in a moment he was being carried
down stream

  quick we must save him cried
pierre

  like a flash they were after him but
the canoe grounded in passing over a
a heart of the north



shoal they pushed the canoe back with
their paddles in an effort to get to one
side of the obstruction straining hard
they backed a foot or two losing val-
uable time and with a hard shove got
into deep water again

   it is my fault cried the girl  
was looking at the little dog and did
not notice the sunken rocks

   never mind cried pierre  push on
quick 

  from the shore near by a shot rang
out and a bullet grazed pierres body
passing through his coat a second one
followed at once but fortunately also
missed him

  the loud booming report told pierre
that it must have been the shotgun load-
ed with round ball

  he grasped his rifle while anne ma-
rie from the bow sought to keep the
canoe straight but in the thick bushes
he could only see the thin cloud of smoke
with one hand he tried to steer knowing
it would take seme time to reload the
muzzle-loader and hoping that the in-
dian would not shoot

  but the sharper and less powerful re-
port of the hudson bay companys gun
rang out and the bullet struck away be-
yond them in the water

  something then moved in the bushes
the half-breed wanting to get nearer
for a shot had left the cover and came
running to the shore the rifle in pierres
hands gave the spiteful bark of its smoke-
less powder and the half-breed after
two or three more steps pitched heavily
forward and rolled over on his side

  then it was that the wild nature of
anne marie came uppermost she ut-
tered a cry of joy

   quick get at linn  she cried

  nonsense pierre shouted angrily
 look out for the dog 

  paddy had fortunately drifted half-
drowned near a bit of sandy beach
which he had managed to reach and
stood ithere shivering he was picked
up and his muzzle was taken off at once
they jumped ashore then and pierre
stood irresolute and nervous

   i never shot at a man before he
said

   let us go and see proposed the
girl

   what about the indian 

   i think maskoush wants no fight
he shot because simon ordered him to
did you not hear him cry out but the
bullet went far above us little bear
shoots well  best shot in pointe bleue 
he shot high on purpose i will call out
to him

  anne marie called out loudly and au
answer came stepping carefully they
advanced concealing themselves as much
as they could and soon anne marie
threw herself down behind a rock while
pierre instinctively followed her ex-
ample

  the dog now fully recovered ran
forward and began to bark loudly

   he is there simon half a gunshot
away pie was sitting up come a little
farther there-you can see him aim
the gun at him and i will speak see
his gun is on the ground too far for him
to reach

  she shouted to simon but he made no
answer the two then advanced and
saw that he held his head in his hands
as though suffering great pain at this
moment maskoush came up

    put down that gun shouted pierre
with a significant motion of his own rifle

  the indian laid his gun down at his
feet appearing to be very indifferent and
anne marie went up to him and pos-
sessed herself of the weapon

  simon was recovering from his dazed
condition and loudly from the bottom
of his heart consigned them all to per-
dition

    stop that  cried pierre indignantly
 where are you hurt 

   i am not hit answered the half-
breed contemptuously  after you shot
i caught my foot between two stones and
fell i hit my head hard or i would
have been up again and i would have
killed you maitdit

   well im just as glad it happened
that way answered pierre who saw
that blood was trickling from the mans
head where it had come in contact with
a stone

  what shall we do now pierre
asked the girl

   smash both their guns and leave
them where they are she replied con-
temptuously

    but if they have no guns they will
have to go back to lac st jean they


the railroad mans magazine

cant go trapping without them ob-
jected pierre

   the monsieur says well muttered
the indian  we must have the guns

   look here will you swear to leave
us alone this time asked pierre of the
half-breed who had risen unsteadily to
his feet

   nothing-i will swear nothing he
answered furiously  you can strike
hard with your fist but that is not our
way of fighting you have the gun and
can shoot me if you like but i swear
nothing

   you are a coward you can speak
to a man w ith a gun in your hands hut
if you did not have it you would cringe
before me you are going raway with
that woman

   she would have been mine if you had
hot been here you are a thief  you
steal my woman you would be afraid
of me but for your gun yes afraid
for i am a man and  you a stealer of
women 

  pierre unable to stand this any long-
er threw his gun in anne maries hands
and threw himself upon the half-breed
who like a flash pulled out his knife

  anne marie called out a warning but
the men were already locked together
pierre had succeeded in seizing simons
wrist in his left hand while his right arm
was twined around the hulking body

  the struggle for the possession of the
knife was paramount they twisted and
pushed and stumbled over the rocks and
panted with their exertion while paddy
kept circling around them barking and
snarling and looking for a chance to
bite

  once his fangs sank in the half-
breeds boots but the heavy leather pro-
tected him

  twice pierre was nearly pushed over
on his back but succeeded in keeping his
footing until the half-breed suddenly dis-
engaged the arm he had managed to get
around pierres neck and seized him by
one thigh which he wrenched upward

  with his full weight bearing upon the
young man breast to breast they fell
over but pierre by a vigorous twist of
his body escaped the full shock of the
fall at the same time with his right
hand now free he aimed a fearful blow
at the half-breeds jaw

  they fell upon their sides neither one
underneath and simons elbow struck
upon a stone and his hand opened drop-
ping the knife

  like a tigress arine marie pounced
upon it and sent it flying in the rapids
but now simon got both his arms around
pierres body and his great strength told

  the pressure was more than a human
being could stand and the young man
felt his breath becoming shorter a fierce
pain invaded his chest like the stabbing
of great knives and he knew not whether
it was a harbinger of death

  but thg spirit of fighting forebears was
in him and he struggled on somehow
his right arm got loose and with the last
of his breath while both were lying on
the ground like snarling hounds he
rained blows upon the half-breeds face
who loosened his grip around pierres
body

  with another strugglethe young man
wrenched himself free and in a moment
they were both again standing watching
each other the fury of their faces nekrly
gone

  their panting breath the half-breeds
bloody head their haggard looks their
eager wolfish eyes made them look like
brutes bent on slaughter

  simon thought lie saw a good chance
and threw lnmself upon pierre seeking
to catch him low but he forgot the ready
fists of his opponent and as he dashed
forward he was met with a fierce upper-
cut that staggered him

  in a moment pierre was on him like a
fiend and back-heeled him and the huge
bulk of his enemy was stretched under
him

  the massive throat was in the grasp of
his left hand and his right fist was up-
lifted for a blow as the half-breed gur-
gled 

   quit for the love of heaven  

  pierre arose his clothes torn and soiled
his chest heaving as if the breath would
never return to it in peace the filth of
sand and moss and grit and sweat was
upon him and his limbs shook with the
exhaustion of his nerves

  the weariness of age-long fighting
seized him as if he had gone through all -
the fierce turmoil that may be compassed
in a whole life but when paddy threw
himself upon the half-breed he ordered


a heart of the north



him off and pulled him away by the
scruff of his neck and bade him be still

  during this time anne marie except-
ing when she had taken away the knife
stood still watching the battle that might
mean her life as well as pierres

  maskoush followed the fight eagerly
with the lust that comes to men who see
great strife but did not offer to take any
part in it realizing that the girl with the
gun in her hand was dangerous

  for a minute they were silent as people
are who have been through fierce scenes
of action finally the young man spoke 
 we have had the fight it is over
i want to go back to lac st jean and
anne marie goes with me in the rapids
i could have killed you and again just
before this fight among my people men
fight great fights and they shake hands
after and it is forgotten

   i will shake hands if you wish and
you will swear to leave us in peace if
you are not willing to do that you will
compel me to break your guns to pieces
and to burn your canoe before i go so
that you cannot follow now will you
go in peace and let us alone 

  the half-breed looked at him then at
the girl and at his companion

   i am beaten he finally said  i
will not shake hands with you what do
you want me-to swear 

  pierre still short of breath seriously
under the spell himself of the strange
wildness of the scene began to draw from
the wealth of his imagination a long and
complicated oath that was listened to in
awe by all the others

   now you have heard and you will
repeat after me he said

  the men had instinctively removed
their caps and simon began the oath that
was to bind him

  upon his prospects of future salvation
and upon the rest of nearest and most
remote relatives and ancestors in and out
of purgatory he obligated himself to all
manner of future punishment should he
break his oath to go back up the river to
his camping-rounds without stopping or
returning until the spring should come

  this he did in the-name of the lord
and all the saints the girl and mask-
oush looked awed to hear him take so
solemn an oath when this was over
pierre bade the girl repeat it to maskoush

in his own language so that he should
well understand it as he spoke french
but ill

  crossing his hands upon his scapulars
the indian repeated the binding words
also looking scared at the dread formula

  now will you shake hands said
pierre

  the half-breed shook his head

   i will you brave man said the
indian

 a hearty handclasp was exchanged by
the two men and then pierre and the
girl quietly returned to their canoe fol-
lowed by paddy

  they said nothing as they entered their 
frail craft and pushed off they paddled
a mile or two before speaking

   look here anne marie stop pad-
dling said pierre suddenly realizing
that she was working too hard

  as always she obeyed without a word
and sat in the bow facing him and only
then he realized how bad she looked
there were great black rings under her
eyes and she was thinner and he under-
stood what a strain she had undergone
during these days and how she had suf-
fered

   will they keep their oaths anne
marie he asked

  she looked scared at his question

   keep them she answered  yes
how could they do otherwise a man
might kill and he might rob even rob a
cache but how could a man break such
an oath  

  pierre nodded his head in assent they
were savages and the forms of religion
were as ever with them of greater im-
port and bound them more powerfully
than its spirit

  as- ite kept on paddling pierre grew
aware of a constantly increasing weari-
ness he was sore all over and his chest
that had undergone the bearish hug of
the half-breed pained him badly

  over his body there were bruises re-
sulting from coming into contact with
stones while struggling on the ground
and the excitement of it all had left him
nervous and in truth somewhat dis-
gusted

   we were like a couple of brutes he
suddenly thought out aloud

  you were like the bulls of the orig-
nal the moose spoke the girl  and it


the railroad mans magazine

was fearful to see but a great fight a
fight of strong men for you are brave
and strong and a man from among men
pierre looked at her curiously wonder-
ing whether she meant what she said
her great eyes were gazing at him frank-
ly and he wondered at feeling comforted
by her words by the admiration implied

  their common danger their few days
spent together seemed to lave thrown a
slender bridge over the chasm that sepa-
rated him from that little creature whose
dusky skin whose very rags and poverty
could not hide a personality strange to
him but full of interest

  he felt tired but kept on doggedly
his exhausted muscles laboring mechanic-
ally his efforts caused the canoe to gain
but slightly over the swiftness imparted
by the current his mind was also weary
and his thought stopped coming until he
toiled like an automaton

chapter vi

a hospital in the wilds

tt only took them a little over an hour
a to reach the next portage how-
ever confident they were that pursuit was
no longer to be feared it was best to
take every precaution anne marie took
the gun and watched the river while
pierre unloaded the canoe but as soon
as he had done this and had lifted his
little craft clear of the water his weari-
ness and soreness overcame him

   look here anne marie he said
 that fellow mauled me dreadfully and
ill have to take a bit of rest

  under some little birches near the
landing he lay down upon the mossy soil
and mechanically began to fill his pipe
but exhausted nature had her way and
he fell asleep dropping both pipe and
tobacco-pouch

  anne marie sat near him her chin in
the hollow of her left hand the elbow
resting upon one knee while in the other
hand she still held the rifle

  every minute or two without changing
her position she glanced up the river
but during the remainder of the time her
gaze was fastened upon the young man

  to her he was a great being some-
thing akin to the gods of her ancestors
possessed of strange powers fierce in

battle and yet so jnild in manner so-
lacking in the real knowledge of what to
her was life itself that she looked at him
in awe he seemed to belong to some
race of which she had never before heard

  then she remembered what the mani-
tou-ilno the sorcerer had told her away
up in the north ind her heart seemed
to beat faster

  she understood that pierre was ex-
hausted with fatigue with the blows and
hugs he had borne but she wondered
why he had seemed nervous and at the
disgust that seemed to have taken pos-
session of him after the fight

  the girl watched him long until
hunger awoke him and he smiled at her

   i had a little nap he said

   you have slept two hours she re-
plied smiling also

  he jumped up and in so doing real-
ized once more how bruised he was but
the great weariness had left him and
now it was but a matter of a little pluck

   boil the kettle anne marie he told
her  and in the meanwhile ill make one
journey

  he lifted a great load to his shoulders
and went down the portage which was
quite a short one and repeated the trip
four times until he had carried every-
thing over excepting the rifle and the
few cooking utensils the girl wras using

  they sat down and began to eat
pierre with exceeding appetite but the
girl half-heartedly she gave most of her
food to paddy who kept turning around
them expectantly as usual during meal-
times

  when they had finished she arose and
pierre took the rifle and the cooking
things starting again down the carry
and followed by the girl he did not
notice that she was walking with much
difficulty as if in great pain

  so they started again on a long stretch
of smooth water some eighteen miles
long to the next carry not expecting to
make the whole distance before night
and intending merely to go as far as
possible until it should be time to camp

  the unending digging into the water
began again and they traveled on and
on in silgnce anne marie sitting in the
bow gradually sank farther down at the
bottom of the canoe until her head rest-
ed upon one of the bags
a heart of the north



  she no longer watched the river her

eyes closed and she appeared to become
indifferent to her surroundings pierre
would have thought her asleep had she
not kept her hand upon the injured side
frpm time to time she moaned

   do you feel very badly ou-mem-
eou he asked

  she shook her head unwilling to ac-
knowledge her pain and he continued
to paddle stopping now and then for a
swallow of water or to light his pipe
the river had to be crossed from time
to time to make short cuts at the wind-
ings or to take advantage of swifter
water or in order to avoid the shallow
sand-bars that are common to all the
rivers of that region

  the great northland was ever open-
ing and closing behind them while the
sky on their right showed the changes of
hue that bespeak the coming night

  pierre began to look carefully along
the bank watching for a good place to
iake camp

  by this time he had his second wind
and was working well in a dull me-
chanical fashion the dripping of the
paddle tinkled beside him a pleasant
companionable sound and the dog looked
at him wistfully

  nearer and nearer the poplars and
birches the firs and spruces kept on
coming and then marched past to make
room for others yellow sand - banks
grew to the tender green of rush-lined
shores and these gave way to rocky
places and again to others where the
gaudy tints of deciduous trees touched
with autumnal gold and crimson-with
somber backgrounds of evergreens -
came right down to the waters edge

   little shrill - voiced sandpipers made
circular flights from rock to rock ahead
of him and once he passed a monstrous
horned owl perched on a great hemlock
awaiting the time for his silent flight in
the dark forest

   the sunset was a flash of red and gold
tinting the edges of dark clouds on the
horizon when pierre noticed in a deep
indentation of the shore a level spot
with a tiny brook running down into the
river and plenty of dead trees for fire-
wood with a sweep of his paddle he
turned the canoe and led it to a tiny
sandy beach

  paddy as usual jumped out first in
his delight at being able to stretch his
legs once more and pierre followed
holding the canoe for anne marie

  when he called her thinking that she
was asleep she did not answer and he
pulled his craft a bit higher up on the
sand

  what is the matter anne marie
he asked

  she shook her head and made an effort
to arise  but fell back helpless pierre
lifted her out and placed her carefully
upon a mossy spot

  he put the bundle of blankets under
her head for a pillow and kneeling be-
side her felt her pulse and looked at her
anxiously

  she was very wan and pale excepting
her cheek where red spots were burning
she breathed very hard with short gasp-
ing respirations her hand was ever on
the side that had been hurt

   there must be something the matter
with that lung he told himself then
it was that he longed for greater knowl-
edge of medical things and considered
the situation with great anxiety

  it was too bad he wondered whether
she was mortally ill during all this
time she should have been quietly rest-
ing instead of undergoing the hardships
of the past few days

  perhaps rest would get her well again
but a few hours ago he had thought that
all was serene that all troubles were end-
ed and now it seemed as if they were
just beginning he had felt full of con-
fidence before this but now looked at her
with all the helplessness of a strong
man before a weak and suffering woman

   id better get to work he muttered

  the display of energy gave him some
surcease of worry pie rapidly put up
the little tent tearing up some shrubs to
make a level place and knocking hum-
mocky spots with the back of his ax to
make a smooth floor

  then he spread his waterproof sheet
on the ground after it had been covered
with a thick layer of balsam-boughs
taking the blankets from under the
girls head he replaced them with a bag
and spread them under the tent

  with the dusk of coming night there
was a flurry of strong wind and the
leaves began to fly over the river while


the railroad mans magazine

overhead black clouds were traveling
fast out upon the river dark flaws
struck the surface and the chilly breeze
made him put on his coat the autumn
in these regions is but a short transition
from summer to winter and he realized
that the cold days were coming

  he cut down several dead trees and
made ready a goodly amount of firewood
thinking that the weather might turn
to rain he gathered from the trees sev-
erals armfuls of birch-bark in order to
have plenty of kindling material on hand
and placed it under the tent so that it
might remain dry

  it was nearly dark by the time that he
had his little fire lighted and his kettle
boiling finding that he still possessed
three cans of condensed milk he opened
one of them and diluted some with hot
water thinking it might be a good drink
for the sick girl

  he made her take it holding up her
head in the crook of his left elbow  and
she drank it obediently between her
gasping respirations but without seem-
ing to relish it muchand was evidently
glad when she was allowed to recline
again

  but it was necessary that she should
be taken to the tent and he lifted her
as gently as he could while she feebly
protested that she could go by herself

  he made her as comfortable as he
could and then hurriedly ate a little
smoked meat and a large pancake that he
cooked in his frying-pan resolving that
on the morrow he should make bread

  now that he might be detained by the
girls illness the state of his ilour-bag
had become a matter of some concern
it contained about fifty pounds at the
start and he had used ten dr twelve
pounds at least

  that which remained would not last
very long for two people and a dog at
the rate of two pounds a day for the
three there was only enough for about
three weeks the other provisions were
about at -the same rate though there was
rather an excess of tea and tobacco
which he had taken in view of possible
gifts or exchanges with indians

  fortunately he had plenty of moose
meat and by the light of his camp-fire
he took it out of the bags and inspected
it carefully

  one piece was rather mildewed and
he threw it away then he made a great
boucane and smoked the rest of it strong-
ly again

  on the morrow he would take a careful
survey of the provisions it was evident
that the girl would not be able to travel
for some days even if her condition had
improved a good deal by morning

  a period of rest might do a great deal
for her

  his activity and the appeasing of his
hunger caused him to see things in a more
favorable light somewhat against his
better judgment he persuaded himself
that anne maries troubles would prove
but a temporary matter

  his pipe once finished he gathered up
all his belongings that might be injured
by rain and placed them under the tent
he had made a roaring fire just for the
pleasant companionship of the blaze and
with the flaps turned up the tent was well
lighted inside

  paddy had gone to sleep curled up
against anne marie the tent had no
opening for the stovepipe and he
planned to make one and line it with
pieces of tin flattened out from some of
his cans

  then they would be able to use the
little stove in the tent for there was no
doubt that the cold weather was coming
soon

  he asked the girl if she would have
more milk or any other food but she re-
fused gently shaking her head she
seemed to be in such pain that he
searched through his little case of medi-
cines finding some dovers powder he
gave her a couple of tablets which she
took with the sublime faith of the savage
in the white mans medicine

  they appeared to quiet her and after
a while her breathing became more regu-
lar and she appeared to fall asleep

  pierre decided that he had earned his
rest his sore muscles rebelled at every
move and he was glad to roll himself in
his blanket after closing the tent flaps

  just then he heard the rainrdfops be-
ginning to patter on the tent walls and
tlie faint hissing of the dying fire outside
as the shower began was the last sound
that he noticed

in a moment as it seemed the world
became a blank and he was sound asleep
a heart of the north



 while outside the rain gathered strength
 and soon fell in torrents with occasional
 lulls during which the wind blew harder
 and shrieked through the tree-tops com-
 ing from the northwest and bringing with

 -	it hints of snow and ice

  he had told anne marie to awaken
him in case she needed anything yet
though the girl slept but little she was
suffering less owing to the opiate he had
given her and bore her i pain quietly
without disturbing him

   she was a stoic this girl of the north-
 land and belonged to a people who pay
 small heed to bodily ills which must be
 borne without complaint at night for
 the rest of others may not be broken on
 account of grief or suffering

   in her disturbed consciousness the man
 who rested near her took the proportions
 of some strange and visionary being with
 a manner that was new and odd and pro-
 claimed him to be of a different race-
 of a kind far remote from her own like
 the strange beings pictured in the images
 of saints and other people whom one
 must worship without pretending to un-
 derstand

   he was masterful and very strong and
 yet sought advice from her in a way that
 seemed hardly fitting and showed re-
 spect for her opinions as if she had not
 been a mere woman a carrier of burdens
 one inured to the idea that man is the
 master and king and woman but his
 slave

   his deference to her did not seem like
 the normal conduct of civilized beings
 for she knew but little of the life in the
 places where the forest exists no longer
 to her innocent mind it rather appeared
 as if constituting a quality inherent to
 that one man who in that as in other
 things was exalted beyond all others

   nor did it seem to the girl that the two
 of them traveling thus together formed
 a strange and unconventional partner-
 ship she was accustomed to the pro-
 miscuity of indian tent - life and saw
 nothing in it to cavil at

   it must be said that pierre on his
part had hardly given the matter a
thought he had been led by a kindly
and impulsive nature things had ad-
justed themselves without any planning
on his part and merely resulted from the
tragedy ever present in the northern life

  to him she was merely an indian-
one of a race so remote from him that he
considered himself as standing apart and
separated from her by a line of cleavage
so strong and so deep that the gap could
never be bridged

  she was handsome of her kind-a
strong lithe being and pleasant withal
-a companion like paddy a source of
worry and concern as the dog would have
been if hurt-but not the tender and gen-
tle thing his mind had evolved as a pos-
sible object of love and care

  pierre awoke just before dawn having
slept many hours as he rose to his knees
to fold his blanket paddys tail beat a
tattoo and he whined a greeting which
only ceased after his master had patted
his head

  the girl opened her eyes quietly with-
out stirring

   how do you feel anne marie he
asked

   i have less pain she answered

  did you sleep 

   i did not sleep much sometimes i
did not know if  was asleep or awake
i saw many strange things my head feels
heavy

   thats the opium he decided

  her pulse seemed to him to be very
fast and her forehead was cool but the
hand he had taken from under her blan-
kets was moist and hot she was breath-
ing fast and was lying upon her injured
side

  the rain was coming down heavily
upon the tent but the wind seemed to
have gone down it was rather dark yet
and in the mist as he lifted up the tent-
flaps there was but an indistinct sug-
gestion of surrounding objects they
appeared as if wrapped in a fog through
which somber masses were only hinted at

   do you feel hungry  he asked her

   water-please give me water she
replied

  pierres conscience smote him he had
allowed her to remain all night without
anything to drink her fever must have
made her very thirsty and yet she had
been unwilling to disturb him

  he took up his little teakettle and
went out in the rain toward the brook
the sky was becoming of a lighter gray
in the east during the night the tiny
stream had grown into a brawling burn


the railroad mans magazine

and the water was very muddy he went
to the shore for some river water

  anne marie drank like one devoured
with thirst and at intervals made neces-
sary by her short breathing she half
emptied the kettle with a sigh of re-
lief she put it down and pierre went out
to fill it again

  when he returned she was sleeping
and he placed the vessel near her sit-
ting down at the entrance of the tent
he watched the growing of daylight it
was cold and he wrapped his blanket
around his shoulders

  paddy left the girls side and sat be-
side him shivering this soon grew too
dull for the dog however and it went
back to sleep

  a wonderful loneliness such as he had
never before felt in the forest came over
him there was something inexpressibly
dreary in the falling rain and the misty
outlook

  if he had been alone he would have
prepared his breakfast thrown his cape
over his shoulders and started out not
heeding the rain any more than do the
highlanders from whom he had partly
sprung

  it would have been life motion effort
but -this was an inactivity that gradually
entered his soul he was in a manner
trapped knowing not when the release
would come

  he was here to-day and to-morrow
would see him here and the next day
perhaps

  if the girl should die he would have
to bury her under a tree and leave her
there in the coming storms and snows
and make his way back alone with the
feeling that somehow he had been given
something to guard and protect and had
failed in his duty

  he should have gone farther the day
before for then he might have camped
near a waterfall and there would have
been the life of the rushing waters in-
stead of the dreary monotony of the broad
river so sad and somber under the great
pall of the falling rain

  he replaced the kettle he had put by
the girl by a full cup and then brought
a charred end of a log in the tent and
split it up into dry sticks after several
trials and the expenditure of a good deal
of birch-bark he managed to light a fire

to leeward of a big rock and put on the
kettle to boil

  the routine of these simple prepara-
tions which commonly gave him pleas-
ure seemed irksome now it was a disa-
greeable duty-a sort of penance for a
man of action

  anne marie took a little condensed
milk while he had his tea but she looked
longingly at his cup

   do you want any  he asked

  she nodded eagerly and he gave her
some which she seemed to enjoy she
refused any other food however and he
ate without much relish tossing bits of
bread and meat to the dog who was hun-
grier than his master

  this modest repast over he took the
flour-bag out of the waterproof sacks
and stood it on its bottom in the tent
rolling over the edges until they were
within a couple of inches of the level of
the flour he shaped the white powder
into the form of a wide funnel into
which he poured some water he began
to knead the mass adding more water
and pushing in more flour from the sides
of the bag until there was enough dough

  then he worked in it a spoonful of
baking powder and made a big flat
round loaf lifting it out of the bag
the remainder of the flour was left per-
fectly dry he repeated this process
three times

  near by upon the sandy beach he
built a roaring fire with big logs and
after it had burned some time he dug
out the sand from beneath the brazier
on the leeward side until he had exca-
vated a little trench

  at the bottom of this he deposited his
loaves and simply shoveled the sand
back upon them with a pole he pushed
back his burning logs over the trench and
added more keeping up a roaring fire
for about twenty minutes heedless of the
rain that fell upon his shoulders

  then he shoved the blazing mass away
and dug into the sand finding his loaves
thoroughly baked they were quickly
carried into the tent to keep them dry
and then pierre scraped them with a knife
to remove the very small amount of sand
adhering to them

  whenever he came into the tent he
asked the girl whether there was anything
he could do for her and how she felt and
a heart of the north



always she made as little as possible of
her trouble and tried to smile but the
rapidity of her respirations the moans
she uttered when she thought he could
not hear her quick pulse and hot dry
skin showed that she was very ill

  he chanced to remember that people
with pneumonia spat a reddish brown
substance he had seen it in the hos-
pital and decided that she was not suf-
fering from that disease he made up
his mind that it was a pleurisy and was
rather pleased with himself at having
made a diagnosis and then he also had
an impression that it was not as danger-
ous as pneumonia though people certain-
ly died of it sometimes

  it was important to take stock of the
provisions and he unpacked all the bags
in the tent and looked over the contents
there was the flour from which he had
just taken about six pounds for his
loaves and a little more than half a can
of baking powder

  the moose meat amounted to over
eighty pounds without bone there were
half a ham four pounds of bacon about
eight of fat pork three or four of
salt butter in a tin can and about four
pounds each of oatmeal and rice and per-
haps two pounds of beans

  there was a good deal of salt as he
had taken a lot in order to prepare a
scalp if he killed big game he also
had some pepper half a bottle of pickles
three cans of condensed milk one of them
freshly opened

  he also found about six pounds of
sugar and four of tea the ammunition
amounted to two boxes of rifle cartridges
holding twenty each from one of these
several had been expended there was
also a box of  cartridges for his little
pistol used for partridges

  the total footed up to about a hun-
dred and seventy pounds of food which
at the rate of six pounds a day for two
healthy adults would last about four
weeks then it wascertain that for some
days to come the girl would not eat very
much

   anne marie he asked  how long
will it take us to go from here to the
first falls of the peribonca 

   about fifteen days-not more she
replied

  there was plenty of leeway if the girl

   	r r

did not remain ill too long and he felt
much relieved at the same tune he de-
cided that he ought to neglect no oppor-
tunity of procuring food in case they
were detained

   if you dont mind my leaving you
he told the girl  i think ill go and try
to get some fish

  anne marie looked at him in some sur-
prise it seemed so strange to hear a
man asking permission from a woman to
do as he pleased

   all right she answered nodding

  on the opposite shore there was a long
bank lined with reeds near which he
thought that pike would lurk taking a
spoon and a hand - line with him he
pushed off the canoe and began to troll

  thefish did not bite well in the rain
and after several hours paddling he
only had three rather small ones - the
largest under four pounds

  this was tiresome and he decided
that he could come back at any time and
get more besides anne marie perhaps
needed him he returned to camp and
cleaned his fish the largest he split
front and back to the tail and hung it
over the smoke the rain which had
stopped for a time began again in a
steady downpour

  the rest of the day was dismal he
sat down in the tent wishing for a book
he had never before wanted to read in
the woods from time to time he felt
the girls pulse and wondered whether
any of the few tablets he had in his medi-
cine-case would be good for lier

  he talked gently to her but soon de-
sisted as it seemed so hard for her to
answer she had to make an effort in
order to speak it was better not to let
her do so paddy was a source of com-
fort  but within the narrow limits of the
little tent there was no room for romp-
ing and with an idle dogs astonishing
capacity for sleep he slept nearly all day
curled up beside anne marie

  pierre smoked innumerable pipes and
it gave him rather a headache he was
actually grateful when the girl manifest-
ed a desire for a little water and he con-
stantly offered her milk or tea he idled
over his midday meal and conscientious-
ly made it consist nearly entirely of fish
so as to save provisions

  the afternoon went by full of weary


the railroad mans magazine

  longing for something to do more fish
  for supper made him hope that he would
  not have to live very long on an exclu-

	sive diet of pike

    the night came slowly and when it
  was dark he felt like lighting a candle
  but made up his mind to be saving he
  had a big fire outside the tent and en-
  joyed its comforting glow when at
  length he rolled himself in his blankets
  he slept poorly

    anne marie complained often in her

sleep and each time he whispered a query
to find out if she wanted anything

  once he was awakened during a brief
interval of sleep and heard her mutter-
ing something in the montagnais lan-
guage he wondered whether she was
dreaming and the fear came over him
that she was delirious he touched her
forehead and she awoke shivering

   oh she said in a low voice peer-
ing intently in the dark  i dreamt that
kuick-wa-tiao the carcajou was here

the immortal j n

an unfortunate eccentric whose affliction was an unsound mind and
whose recompense was an innate nobility and dignity of soul

probably many of our readers were
reminded of a familiar and eccentric
character when reading a recent number of
the  observations of a country station-
agent our attention was called to him
afresh by the courtesy of mr c w bales
springfield illinois who sent us the pass
reproduced herewith

  the  immortal j n was no fictitious
character neither was he an insignificant
one so far as personality is concerned al-
though overtaken by the misfortune of an
unbalanced mind he retained the force of
a wonderfully magnetic character

  he was known all over the country as the
 prince of dead-heads in enlightening

us as to the personality of the  immortal
j n mr j e smith the author of the
article in which he was mentioned says

   he traveled continuously and paid no
car fare or hotel bills he styled himself
the apostle of truth-the great reconcil-
iator

   he employed the vague terms of  lift-
ing the veil  and  removing the pressure
to indicate the occult power he held and
which he believed he could employ at any
minute at will either to the blessing or con-
fusion of mankind

   his real name as i recall it was jacob
newman free and his home was some-
where in ohio as a young man he studied
law and was a
scholar of promise
later his mind be-
came affected and
his mania was to
travel

   his hair grew
long and hung about
his shoulders his
culture was always
in evidence he was
tall and straight and
impressive his
memory of faces
and names was mar-
velous wherever
he went he knew
the people and al-
ways manifested a
sincere interest in
their welfare

facsimile of a pass issued to the immortal j n
the immortal j n



    he was admitted to homes and was tol-
 erated and honored everywhere his cour-
 tesy majesty and force were his passports

    as a rule hotel men treated him as a
 guest and i think railroads provided him
 with passes similar to the one now in your
 possession the passes usually indicating that
 they were given for some high-sounding
 consideration his wrath when asked to
 pay bill or produce a fare was grand and
 dignified and quite overwhelmed the sup-
 plicant

     his acceptance of a favor was with such
  dignity that all who administered to him
  were glad and honored to be able to do so
  he died a few years ago just before the
  anti-pass agitation naturally we attrib-
  uted all that followed to  j n as having
  at last lifted the veil or removed the
   pressure 

   in- a recent issue of the pittsburgh
 dispatch the following reference was made
 to his library

    hidden away in the most unlikely place
 in the world a shabby wofully prosaic little
 cottage in a country loyn is a library so
 unique and valuable that to wander among
 its ancient tomes and fondle their ponderous
 clasps and worm-eaten pages would plunge
 the ordinary bibliomaniac into what robert
 louis stevenson called  fine dizzy muddle-
 headed joy

     since there is  real reason for preserv-
  ing the secret forever inviolate let it be
  told that the village is mccutcheuville in
  wyandot county ohio and the owner of the
  library is mrs elias cooley while this

name may not convey any special signifi-
cance mrs cooley is the sister of the late
jacob newman free better laown as the
 immortal j n and the last surviving
member of an extraordinary family

  to-day his splendid library is piled in
confusion in the little mccutchenville cottage
in mute testimony of his erudition in the
old home one side of the front room from
floor to ceiling was lined with volumes and
the table in front of the shelves was heaped
with them the collection numbered about
one thousand volumes they are printed
in many languages-in latin greek ger-
man hebrew sanskrit and chinese some
of them date as far back as the middle of
the sixteenth century these are stanch
old tomes but the worms have bored their
neat little tunnels quite through the heavy
bindings of wood and leather some are
pierced in this way from cover to cover and
a few are gnawed by the rats

   one book dated  and written in
latin contains the works of eusebius
bishop of gesarea in palestine the
covers are a quarter of an inch thick and
covered with leather and the front is closed
with metal clasps another similar in date
and binding is devoted to the works of
chrysostom a sixteenth-century bible is
over two feet long the front cover and
the backs are torn off and reveal the
method of binding the works of justin
the philosopher and martyr printed in con-
stantinople in s are a curious commin-
gling of latin and greek and are abundantly
interlined with notes in the same language

transporting mischief

half a billion pounds of explosives are carried annually by the
railroads with scarcely an accident

colonel w b dunn chief inspector
of the american railway association
recently delivered an interesting address
before the society of natural sciences
 the use of explosives

  some years ago according to the speaker
dynamite and other high explosives were
treated as ordinary freight but when com-
mercial uses brought the production up to
 pounds a year it became neces-
sary for experts to solve the problem of
safe transportation nowadays there are
 cars of explosives constantly in transit

upon the railroads of this country so that
according to the law of averages a traveler
should pass one in every fifty miles of a
journey

  that the problem has been solved colonel
dunn said was evidenced by the rarity of
accidents from these causes inspectors
are at work constantly watching the packing
and shipment of explosives to see that all
regulations are obeyed the speaker as-
serted that accidents which occur in the
handling of these explosives are due to
ignorance
observations of a country
station-agent

by j e smith

no -one cannot always tell just who constitutes his public
when he tries to inject some superheated kindness and
good cheer into his daily routine

ily harm this semidementia begins
when the patron arrives at the ticket-

	window and remains until the journey
is ended and normal conditions are re-
stored by rest and quiet  a kind
word to those in the waiting-rooms and
who may be too timid toask questions
shows thoughtfulness and is received with
appreciation    a few minutes spent
among the occupants of the waiting-room
may bring dollars to the company in re-
turn

  it is not the purpose of the writer to
seriously discuss the value of courtesy
he has had a close range hand-to-hand
conflict with the  dear people covering
twenty r five years and he has modified
and qualified his earlier opinions

   if all ticket-agents and conductors were
born gentlemen and all the men and
women who travel were genteel well
bred and considerate there would be no
 courtesy  problem

  everything is comparative if all men
were rich there would be no riches if
all men were polite there would be no
politeness

cent of us are rude unpolished and im-
pudent from the day of our birth

          great railroad of the
west recently installed
a systematic course of
instructions teach-
ing employees the  eti-
 quette of travel it
coolly calculates that courtesy aids the
road to get and hold business it argues
that passengers at stations or on trains are
usually nervous ill at ease and really
need special attention which in turn
they will appreciate to the extent of re
membering and recommending the road

  the first pamphlet of instructions
opens with the qualifying admission that
 affability is a talent it is also in some
cases a genius one can be cultivated 
the other can be acquired only by great
effort

  of passengers in general it makes this
observation

   a large percentage of passengers on
a train are in a more or less abnormal
condition ranging from uneasiness to
positive hysteria or nervous prostration
conductors can call to mind many cases
where such conditions have become mani-
fest by passengers attempting to jump
from the train in many cases passengers
have succeeded in doing themselves bod-

  then we do not reach the high pas-
senger jobs on the railroad until we pass
our fortieth year and all the distance
we have fought our way over a rough-
and-rugged course and we arrive some-
what ruffled and gnarled

  as an example of this i took a good
look at  buck  jones

  buck runs our package local buck
shaves and trims his hair every time hai-
leys comet visits the earth and probably
wont take a bath until he falls into the
creek buck has an ultramarine vocabu-
lary that fits every angle of a local freight
run only ten words in all - none of
them in the dictionary or book of rules
used singly or in combination they cover
the whole range and all ex-
tremes of human feeling

  some day in the lock-step
forward march of a conduc-
tors life buck will be next up
for a passenger run he knows
how to do his work and run a
local freight but can he be civ-
ilized thats the question

  after a man has put in
twenty years handling barrels
boxes and green hides initi-
ating green brakemen and side-
stepping the responsibility of
 overs  shorts and  dam-
ages he isnt likely to be an
ideal professor of the  art of
gentle manners

  its like putting a full-dress
suit on the cave man

  but maybe they can subdue
buck and get on a veneer of
polish every real diamond
you know comes from the
mud and we can never know
its sparkle and carat until it goes through
the processes of cut and polish

  maybe the courtesy school wont
take notice when buck walks in glad
im not the professor

  there are more bucks among us than
professor courtesy suspects

  i went over to the passenger station to
explain it all to chauncy our ticket-man

   chauncy i said benignly  that
sad far-away board-pastrdue she-never-
spoke-again look must come off your face
have you seen the primer

   hold on protested chauncy  i
cant keep up this antimeat diet- is

going to your headsit down a minute

ill open this window for a little air
when did you first notice it 

   never mind me  i exclaimed  its
you you are to get a series of instruc-
tions by mail on  politeness or how to
be a gentleman regardless of the nat-
ural bent or other deformities and in
spite of yourself 

 ere is one day when
this office will for-
get to emit its

  what is it one of them  put-in-

young man if you ever git the rheumatism
like i hev

peated chauncy contemptuously  maybe
i havent learned anything in ten years
standing here and hammering that dater
every day do you think them fellows
in the general offices can tell me any-
thing 

   they are not telling you anything
about how to handle an  l  punch or to
fill in a skeleton ticket to saskatchewan
via winnipeg or how to route a home
seeker to tacoma via the  air-ship line 
returning they are going td improve
your manners they are going to make
you so pleasant polite and considerate
that people will come for miles to ride on
your road

   there will be a big sign over your
door reading  welcome as people
enter you will stand by and bow bestow
a cheering word and extend a warm hand-
clasp then you will circulate among
them with genial cheer and engaging
amiability you will be helpful and con-
siderate to the aged the ill and the in-
firm you will mingle in common broth-
erhood and be a father to all who come
to you

   hold on  protested chauncy  this

line of talk is not for yours
truly my system cannot be
improved upon it is the re-
spectful distance instead of
the close touch when my
brand of poise and decorum
dont suit em its me back to
agriculture whats the use of
straining yourself to be polite
when you can get one dollar
for a rooster and forty cents a
dozen for eggs 

  the argument became heated
i held for intimate relations
and chauncy for a dignified
reserve

    ill tell you what ill do
you proselyte missourian   i
exclaimed with warmth  ill
show you up ill run this
ticket-office one day on the
plan outlined in the pamphlet
ill lift the sadness from this
dismal joint ill make the
people feel that this is not the
cave of gloom or the chamber
of horrors but the house of
gladness 

  on the following day chaun-
cy turned the plant over to me with all
rights and good-will

  i took a chesty pride in showing the
young man up i was eager to demon-
strate to him the value of the sympathetic
ear and the kind word and by contrast
bring disgrace on him in public

  i appeared neatly shaven and with
vaselined hair i wore a gaudy vest and
a necktie of brilliant hue for bright colors
suggest cheer

  chauncy slunk into an obscure cor
ner to be a passive and unsympathetic ob
server of the days doings

   arent you going to open with a hal-
leluiah service he asked tauntingly

   i may hum soihe merry ditty from
hour to hour and in between i may whis-
tle snatches of some blithesome song i
replied then i added insinuatingly
 anyway here is one day when this
office will forget to emit its customary
dental-parlor groans

  the telephone rang rather persistent-
ly but i answered every time with
promptness and with a cheery  dont
forget to call again and  no trouble
at all i assure you
observations of a country station-agent 

  still for the life of me i do not see
why one woman had to call me up four
times to find out how to get to pennville
and back particularly when i was so
careful to give her every detail the first
time oh well women are naturally
nervous about travel and we must em-
phasize what we explain to them before
they feel fully assured

    br-r-r-r-r-r-r 

    hallo  ticket - office oi the tip-top
railroad hows that pennville yes
thats correct as i told you let you have
it again oh very well-with pleasure
eh flows that

  i held my hand over the mouthpiece so
my voice would not carry

  wouldnt that frost you i ob-
served to chauncy  she says her aunt
jane says there aint such a train out of
pennville that i gave her says whos
right-aunt jane or me

   i notice your brow is slightly corru-
gated hinted chauncy

  i directed ray attention to the teles
phone

   hallo your aunt jane is mistaken
you can count on the train as i gave it to
you

   well we think we do-

   anyway this time shes off-mis-

   dont bang that telephone so hard
when you hang it up suggested chauu-
cy  they cost money

  an old lady came into the waiting-
room and seated herself with a sort of
grim endurance for an hours wait

  i went out and greeted her with a
friendly salutation

   good morning grandma said i
 you have quite a wait before your train
comes if you will sit over in this seat i
will raise the window for you this is a
fine morning and the spring air is a
tonic

   i dont see why you want the wind to
blow on me for  observed grandma
with a cold steely look  young man
if you ever git the rheumatism like i hev
you wouldnt ask eny one to set in the
wind im thinkin you didnt ask me to
expose myself for eny good what you
thought of was if id set there in the
draft maybe id go home and die then
all my folks from around dayton and
eaton would haft to come out here to

the funeral and ffiat would make busi-
ness for your old railroad youre in a
awful little business youre purty low-
clown you air

   indeed madam i hastily apolo-
gized  i was only looking to your com-
fort

   well they aint no use to argue
im goin to stay sot right here nd
youd obleege me by not sayin eny more
to me

  i beat it into the office  chauncy
chuckled exultantly

  then a voice called to me through the
ticket-window-one of those raspy in-
sistent voices with a  step-lively  and
 come-across  inflection to it

   say young fellow he demanded
 i want some information i want to
go to kalamazoo and return to kokomo
and then to oshkosh by to-morrow
night and if i get to peoria how much
time will i have at aurora and how
far is urbana from susquehanna and
do you know of a good dollar-a-day house
at champaign  and when is the last
interurban out of paducah quite a
wait at effingham before  could get out
to cairo aint it wouldnt be sur-
prised if it didnt rain before night-

  this came out in a straight string and
only one breath

   i shoved him the official guide

  fie pushed it back

   say you look it up i cant get
anything out of them guides

   really i explained  i dont think
i can find the time right nov there
are so many waiting for tickets-

   youre paid for looking these things
up aint you   he blurted

   yes but- i had that pitched
higher than was necessary so i modified
it to the gentle assurance that in a very
little bit i would look it up for him

   oh never mind he snapped  give
me a ticket to sweetser a man can get
a stock-market tip out of j pierpont
morgan about as easy as he can get a
piece of travel information out of a
ticket-agent

  a sort of mocking cough issued from
the corner of the office

  then the telephone-bell rang

   hallo 

   so-uncle reub says there isnt any
such a train out of pennville well the


the railroad mans magazine

guide says there is thats all i can say
whats that oh no we wouldnt
purposely mislead you no we would
not i say we would not i want you to
understand-

   br-r-r-r-r-r  right in my ear
caliban sitting in the corner pulled
his hat down over his eyes to hide the
grimace of his face no need of that
i didnt look over in his direction

   goodness me came a thin piping
voice from the other window  im afraid
youll make me miss my train you keep
me standing here so long for a ticket
you are certainly not very attentive
after the rush had subsided a little i
noticed a dear young thing with velvet
eyes and peach - blow cheeks looking
about the waiting-room she seemed so
timid and so frail to be alone in the rude
jostle of a public station that i hurried
out to her to speak a word of cheer i
was eager to circulate

  i asked her if there was any informa-
tion i could give her could i bring
her some of our reading-matter to enter-
tain her while she waited

  she thrilled me with a smile

   you are so nice and considerate she
said that high - voltage compliment
went through me to the finger-tips

  with fine presence of mind i put one
over for the railroad

  it is our desire to be kind and con-
siderate to our patrons the road de-
mands it and we find it a pleasure

  really she blushed it is so
unusual - so extraordinary i always
thought railroad men were so er-well
not exactly rude but so blunt and-and
-rather peremptory i always shud-
dered when i had to ask them for infor-
mation

   i am sorry we have that reputation
i rejoined smilingly  in a measure
we may have deserved it but we expect
to make amends we expect to become
more and more courteous and obliging
to our patrons and attract them to us
instead of repelling them  nothing pays
so well as kindness  i added that max-
im as though i had just received it fresh
by wireless from  poor richard or
confucius

   how delightful  she exclaimed

  then with a sort of legerdemain and
quicker - than - the - eye dex-
terity she whipped from the
folds of a fluffy jacket a rose-
colored magazine and thrust
it into my hands

   thats the ladies home
doings she added with a
quick smile  published in
quakerville i am canvass-
ing for subscriptions only
two dollars the year think
of that only two dollars
american menus american
patterns american morals-
and society ninety-six pages
of uplift and refinement every
month 

  i put on the reverse and
began to back slowly

  she stayed me with a pretty
hand on my arm she lifted
her eyes appealingly to mine

   if i can get them a mil-
lion subscribers she went 
with a sort of pathetic hun-
ger  i get a trip to europe
you know what that means
to a girl you are a ticket-
man you know how travel
observations of a country station-agent 

broadens and educates you are such a
good man-such a nice man-such a kind
man you will help a poor girl wont
you 

  a sudden impulse of benevolence over-
came me i could not turn her away i
thrust my hand deep into my trousers-
pocket and brought forth two shining
 e pluribus unums and she deftly
slipped them into the capacious maw of
her dangling reticule

do about that train that doesnt run out
of pennville i have told you it does
d-o-e-s d-o-e-s run is that plain
enough uncle reub oh uncle reub
be hanged 

  i hung up with a bang

   whoa  came the croaking voice
from the corner

  i went out into the mens waiting-
room primarily to cool off but inciden-
tally with another consignment of good

   how nice of you she added record-
ing my name you will be delighted
with the magazine i know you will
you might help me with others couldnt
you speak to some of your friends for
me  

   dont forget i interrupted with
fine business instinct  that when you go
to europe our line takes you to new
york

   oh the magazine people will attend
to that she replied and was gone

   stung 

  that hoarse exultant chuckle came
from the corner of the office

  the telephone was ringing

   hallo  yes what am i going to

cheer- to scatter among the few passen-
gers that were there

  a lean hawk-nosed man sat on the end
of a seat apparently dejected and dys-
peptic

  he empaled me with a restless eye and
i at once came back at him with the cor-
dial information that it was a nice day

   nice day to-day said he gloomily
 but what of to-morrow  this is a bad
climate to-day everything may be fine
to-morrow it may be raw and blustry
and the next day you may have pneu-
monia and next week your lodge may be
passing appropriate resolutions on you
thats this climate sir 

   well i said cheerfully  a few of

will we be here next week he demanded


the railroad mans magazine

us get through it all right you and i
are still here

   but will we be here next week  he
demanded almost fiercely  tell me
that some one dies every minute
whats your minute whats mine he
jumped up and confronted me at close
range as if to read the answer in my
open joyous countenance

   seafch me said i airily  why
dont you see a trance clairvoyant

   thats itl  he shouted  the
american people are always joking-al-
ways frivolous-always light-headed
whats the use to be otherwise i
argued  why not fill the world with
joy and sunshine to-day and take no heed
of to-morrow  

  improvidence criminal neglect
casting off the loved ones to be a bur-
den  others

  no gloom for me said i edging
over toward the office

  he clung to me and followed me in

   youre a salaried man he persist-
ed  you get so much every month
you know wliat to count  you are
the last man in the world to fail to pro-
vide for your little ones-to save them
from the cold and cruel world if your
minute should come soon study that
he thrust a pamphlet into my unwill-
ing hands

   we wrote eleven thousand and nine
new policies in  whats our out-
standing insurance two hundred and
seventy million dollars we have never
contested a claim whats ourassets
over a hundred million  look over one
of our double -barreled quick - trigger
ten-shot policies where you share in the
surplus and participate in the dividends
-where you draw out more than you pay
in - and we actually pay you for the
privilege of carrying your insurance
you should have a five-thousand-dollar
policy whats vour age  

   hold on  i cried cut it out
a railroad man that eats meat and eggs
cant have any money left for premiums
nix on more insurance

   you dont care what becomes of your
family he asked with a tone of in-
jury

   that neednt be any concern of
yours i retorted warmly  ill take
care of the family

    the little ones can go begging eh  
    vamose  clear out 

   of course theres orphan homes-
  to the waiting-room for you

   and private charities-

  dig

   and poorhouses-

  i slammed the office-door and wiped a
few beady drops from my forehead

  a strange guttural sound came from
the corner

  the telephone ran

   you ought to know came the voice
to my  hallo  that they aint any train
out of pennville uncle reub says the
durned fool-

  i cut off the rest of it by hanging up
the receiver then i rubbed my head
and said tranquillity-tranquillity-
tranquillity forward backward and
down the middle nine times until i was
composed and could not hear the mock-
ing snicker that came from the corner

   just then i noticed a frail little woman
in the ladies waiting-room looking out
of the window at nothing in particular
and sobbing gently

  i was moved by the womans tears and
hurried out to her

   my dear madam i exclaimed  it
pains me to see you cry can i do any-
thing for you how can i help you in
your troubles  

   you - can-jielp-me-a-little-if

-	if - you - will she sobbed lifting
tear-stained eyes to me

   ill do anything in reason madam
i added hastily  anything   for she
was pretty

   weve-had-a-quarrel jim and
me hell - follow me here - im -
afraid please let me step-in your-
office-a minute-or two-until he-gets
over-his mad spell

   certainly i said opening the door
she stepped inside and planted herself
before a mirror which we had in the rear
of the office with dainty hands she re-
adjusted her hat her rat and her puffs
and wiped her eyes

  a husky-looking young fellow thrust
his nose up to the ticket-window

   say he called  have you seen a
woman around here wearing a large
black hat and a blue suit

   no sir i answered stoutly

   you would remember her if you saw
observations of a country station-agent  

her she has large blue eyes and fine
teeth-nice complexion too im awful
anxious to find her i am for sure

   well she hasnt been here i an-
swered with indifference  ive seen em
all none of em answers that descrip-
tion

   im disappointed - i sure am he
answered in a sorrowful tone turning

  he grew purple with rage

   aint you going out and mix with
the public asked chauncy reproach-
full

  i refused to go out and when the
bruiser saw i positively would not ac-
cept any invitations for morgue honors
he moved away with the woman clinging
to him

away  i wanted to tell her how sorry
i am

  the door of our office flew open

  here i am jim cried the little
woman running to him

   why puss he exclaimed  were
you hiding in there 

  then he made a rush for the office
but the spring-lock held him he reap
peared at the window redder than a train-
order flag

   so you was putting your oar in this
was you-you pie-faced monkey-come
out from behind there he roared  and
ill decorate that mug of yours so you
couldnt be identified for a month  come
on out you smug-faced lying coward-
you-you-

  but the woman returned to the window
for a parting shot

    i would have you know she replied
 that jim is a perfect gent

   then she elevated her nose and tilted
out to jim and they departed arm in
arm

  chauncy should have gone out and ex-
plained matters instead of that he
wanted to match me against them know-
ing too that i might go too far and do
something i might regret i am disgust-
ed with him

 at luncheon i called him on the phone
hes too perverse and thick-headed to
learn anything anyway besides why
should i neglect my duties at the freight-
house 

i would have you know
that jim is a perfect
gent


te railroad mans magazine

  so i told him bluntly that i would not
return for the afternoon and for him to
run the passenger station in his own way

  the other day i read a strange story
it is said to be true it is a story of the
 kind word  and the  ultimate re-
sult

  there lived in a small town near
chicago a rich but eccentric old man

  he made frequent trips between his
home and the city he was of a curious
turn asked many questions and drew
heavily on the patience of the conductors

  one conductor whom we shall call
jones was always polite to the old man
and often put himself out a little to
amuse or entertain him with stories or
observations out of the ordinary

  it pleased the old man and at length
he made it a rule to select joness train
whenever he could for his trips

  no matter how importuning the old
man was jones never grew irritable or
short or crusty it is joness way he
is- always pleasant with every one he
really doesnt know how to be otherwise

  one day the old man traveled to that
bourn from which there are no return-
tickets they-read his will

  there were some minor provisions
among them was an item bequeathing
the sum of one thousand dollars to con-
ductor jones  for kindness

  this being a true story shows that it
pays to be civil and it pays to mix-
only dont overmix

a hold-up on hog mountain

by augustus wittfeld

         monk tells of a ride on the scenery special
         that was rudely interrupted by a pesky pirate

hese stories of hold-ups
and train - robberies said
monk  always remind me
of an actress who has been
robbed of her glittering
glassware you never
heard of any one doing much on the pro-
ceeds of histrionic highwaying and the
man who attempts to hold up a modern
express - train may get away with the
goods but eventually the sheriff puts him
on his visiting-list

    right you are replied the pug-
nosed brakeman  it takes nerve to hold
up a train but it takes more than nerve
to pull the trick off successfully and re-
tire on the proceeds the men who pos-
sess all the qualifications requisite for
such jobs generally land a sinecure be-
hind the frosted-glass partition

    now youre talking classical eng-
lish commented monk  and expressing
clarified thought in capsule form i never
knew but one man to pull off a hold-up
successfully and then obliterate himself
from the surroundings

   it happened down south where at
one time the railroads were noted far their
lack of speed and where it was impossi-
ble to miss a train all you had to do
if your train had left the station was tt
follow it on foot and you couldnt miss
it unless you overlooked it or mistook its
creeping for the inertia of a side-tracked
 section

    yes commented the pug - nosed
brakeman  i knew of a mandown there
who brought suit against the s l o
road to recover for damages sustained dn
bumping into the rear end of the moon-
light limited while walking along the
track

   the company tried to non-suit him
by bringing a counter charge of trespass
but his lawyer threatened to attack the
validity of their charter on the ground
that they could not prove that they were
running trains and they withdrew their
charge

   the plaintiff won his suit and the
company was ordered to upholster the
rear end of their trains to prevent a repe-
tition of such accidents

   well to get back to the hold-up
said monk  i was touring the south
some years back and at this particular
time my objective-point was boonville
as i had lots of leisure i decided to
make the trip by rail

   i caught up to a freight bound for
that point and sauntering up to it i
swung myself aboard the caboose and pro-
ceeded to accord myself a cordial wel-
come i took possession of the lower
bunk without waiting for the porter to
appear and was soon in the land of
dreams

   i was awakened by the crew who
had come back to see if the rear end was
all right pie asked me what the stone-
wall jackson i meant by intruding and
volunteered tofunch my ticket or my
head without fear or favor

   i hypnotized him by making a few
occult passes and he extended me the
cordial entente it was pretty good stuff
even though it was tax-free and did not
bear the pure-food guarantee

   if you will pardon the interruption
said the pug-nosed brakeman  i want to
pay tribute to the railroads of the south
the southern spirit of hospitality is not
dead and the chesterfields of the rail
will give you the glad welcome or the




the railroad mans magazine

i

g b with all the grace born of heredity
and long practise they will tire you
from a train  such courtly manner that
you feel like apologizing for giving them
the trouble

   your prognostication coincides with
my observation commented monk
 this chesterfield of the caboose told
me we were approaching hog mountain
a moonshiners stronghold noted for its
reluctance to contribute to the revenues
of the government and for the weirdness
and grandeur of its scenery

  he said he had to get back to the
engine and tend to his fire and he ad-
vised me to take a seat in the observa-
tory of the caboose and enjoy the phan-
tasorama

   i took his advice and found that we
were traveling up into the mountain and
that the scenery was all that he claimed
for it i was taking in the passing scape
when i noticed a tall mountaineer ma-
king his way down a rugged path toward
us

   he carried a long rifle and was ac-
companied by a lean lanky coon-dog he
reached the railroad - track just as we
passed and spying me looking out of the
observatory window like a blooming juliet
scouring the horizon for a dilatory ro-
meo he pointed his rifle at me and com-
manded 

    you-all throw up your hands 

   i looked at him in amazement but
lost no time in doing the upward del-
sarte movement

    say you moth-eaten mountaineer
i shouted  whats the answer to the rid-
dle youre propounding have i uncon-
sciously butted into a hatfield - mccoy
combination or do you imagine this is a
treasure-train  

    you-all stop that tin or ill blow
your darned head off  he replied

    how the heck do you expect me to
stop the train i shouted back run
along reuben and file your request with
the engineer hes running this seeing-
the-scenery special from the front end

   for a moment he looked as if he
doubted my statement then lowering his
gun he sprinted for the forward end
while i climbed down from my perch and
started out to investigate

   as i stepped from the train it came
to a stop and when i reached the engine

the mountaineer had the engineer and his
man of all work lined up with their hands
as far from earth as possible he caught
sight of me and in a wink he had me
doing the high reach alongside the others

     say growled the engineer  what
you want to do steal this outfit there
isnt anything on board you can take un-
less its the coal in the tender

     dont you-all give me no sass cau-
tioned- the tall man of the mountains
 im going to borrow this train and you-
uns  have to run it fcfi me

   well he made us all climb aboard
packing us into the cab and ordered the
engineer to start up	

     say queried the engineer with his
hand  the throttle  arent you going to
ride  

     no replied the mountaineer  i
haint never been on one of those pesky
things an i aint going to take no
chances i guess i can hoof it and keep
up to you but dont you-all try to run
away from me or ill plug you full of
lead 

   the engineer started up and the
highland hold-up man had no trouble
keeping up with us the queer proces-
sion proceeded for several miles then we
came to a place where a track branched
off from the main line into the heart of
the wilderness here he brought the en-
gine to a stop by pointing his gun at the
engineer and shouting  whoa 

     now you-all git down and move the
track over so we can go up this ere way
he commanded addressing the nian of all
work

    that worthy lost no time in climbing
down and throwing the switch and we
moved along the old unused track

     what the nation does that elongated
outlaw want to run us up this old lumber-
line for   growled the engineer  there
fiasnt been a train along here since the
road stopped taking out timber

     say you train-robber  shouted the
man of all work addressing the patri-
archal pirate in his most courtly manner

 will you kjndly inform us whither we are
going and why and what is our doom

     you-all  find out soon enough
he answered  shut up  

    we proceeded for about three miles
and then the grizzled guerrilla command-
ed the engineer to stop he told the fire-
a hold-up on

hog mountain



man to fix his fires so they would last for
a couple of hours when everything was
ready he lined us up in single file with
the lanky coon-dog in the lead and made
us precede him along a path in the wil-
derness in about fifteen minutes we
came to a cabin in a clearing in answer
to a whistle from our captor a woman
appeared at the door

    mandy he said  ive brought com-
pany for dinner rustle around lively
these gents is in a hurry

   in a short time the meal was ready
and we all sat down it knocked the
wind out of me to hear that venerable
villain ask a divine blessing on the re-
past but it didnt spoil my appetite

   after we had finished and the table
had been cleared our host procured wri-
ting materials and placed them on the
table

    i want one of you-uns to write a
letter he said  guess you-all had bet-
ter do it he continued addressing me

   i expressed my willingness to accom-
modate him and prepared to stenograph
his dictation

    this here letter he said is to be
wrote to the president of these united
states	

   i indited the superscription and wait-
ed for him to commence dictation

    mr president he started and then
continued

  dear sir

    this here section of the country has

railway clerks organization

many railway clerks both members
and non-members entertain the idea
that the sole purpose of this organization is
to compel railway companies to increase
the pay and decrease the hours of service of
its members whether they are justly entitled
thereto or not

  many railway superintendents agents and
other officials look upon this and all similar
movements in the same light and it is the
dominance of this idea over one of both
parties to a controversy over wages and con-
ditions of service that leads to strikes and
lockouts instead of peaceful solution

  this is an entirely erroneous view for
those of either side to hold and because of

its harmful unjust even dangerous tenden-
cies should be stored with memories of the
past and replaced by broader more up-to-
date generous and just views

  these movements are not transient they
are -enduringly based

  like all other class organizations the
brotherhood of railway clerks came into
being in response to an economic necessity

  civilization began witli combination of
effort or organization of the species as its
efficacy and possibilities became apparent
the movement grew and prospered its net
product civilization followed apace and the
evolutionary process marches bravely on-

mallet and his invention

mallet articulated compound no  recently built by the american locomotive
company for the denver northwestern and pacific railway weight

 pounds  boiler pressure  pounds  grate area  square
feet hauling capacity  tons on the level

by arno dosch

the history of anatole mallet and his engine is a curious repetition of
the history of nearly all great pioneers in the field of invention the
story of the fight for recognition and after recognition of his engine
due credit for himself is one of the romances of railroading

     it is a romance that ends happily though not entirely satisfactorily
mallets belated victory has deprived him of all the fruits of victory except
undying fame

     the patents by which his engine was originally protected have long
ago expired and the fact that the creation of his genius and persistence is
revolutionizing the rail transportation power of the world dpes not put
one cent into his pocket the slights of practical railroad men are all the
more difficult to understand when one remembers that mallet has always
been among the very highest of the scientific men of the world

scoffed at by practical builders considered as an unimportant product
of bad railroads the mallet articulated compound is now
the last word in engine construction

  first name - invented the articulated
  compound engine which is revolutionizing
  the handling of freight on american and
  foreign roads

    but there are not a dozen engineers who
  ever heard anything about the man him-
  self and the struggle he had to get recog-
  nition

    this is surprising but is by no means
the most curious circumstance which con-
fronts any one who tries to find out about


hy is this new engine
  called a mallet
  railroad men fre-
  quently ask these
  days  who is mal-
  let anyhow 

 few can answer even among civil
and mechanical engineers he is hardly
more than a name vaguely it is known
that some frenchman named anatole
mallet-and most do not even know his
mallet and his invention



him naturally the place to look for
information regarding a man who has
done such a big thing is among the list
of notables of his own country-in this
case  whos who in france but
strange as it may seem he is totally un-
known to the compilers of this book it
is only by going to the records of the
french academy of sciences that his
importance is realized

                                    

the man mallet

  mallet is still a hale and hearty old
man carrying on the business of con-
sulting engineer at  rue troudaine
paris he is well along toward eighty
years of age but still active

  for fifty-three years he has been a
member of the academy of sciences as
early as  he was secretary of the so-
ciety and now for over thirty years he
has been editor of its publications he
has also been a member of many impor-
tant committees and belongs to several
other french scientific bodies but the
most important and surprising informa-
tion there is to be had about him is that
the mallet locomotive which we regard
as something very new and wonderful
was invented by him in  and put
into actual service as earlyas 

  it has however had a long struggle
for recognition and would not in fact
have arrived at its present importance if
it had not been for the american loco-
motive designer carl j mellin - pro-
nounced melleen it was mellin who
saw the fulness of the possibilities in the
mallet type of compound locomotives
and developed it until it has reached its
present position in the railroad world

  it was not until mellin made practical
use of its great possibilities that mallets
invention had had a chance to show what
it could do although mallet struggled
for many years to bring it before the rail-
roads that it was neglected was a
source of constant sorrow during the
greater part of his life and if he had
not been a particularly ldng-lived man
he would never have seen its final tri-
umph any story of mallet is the story
of his engine as it has been the pride of
his life

  other men had leen trying for a num-
ber of years to work cut the same design

   	r r

as mallet successfully evolved but all
had failed something of the kind was
however a necessity on many of the
smaller crooked railroads in europe
they were narrow-gaged winding as a
road full of sharp turns and of uneven
grade-very much in fact like our trol-
ley- ines they required engines which
could make the sharp turns and coukl ad-
just themselves to the sudden changes in
grade

  mallet solved the problem by making
his engine with a high and a low-pressure
cylinder arranged on an entirely differ-
ent system from the ordinary compound
the engines were necessarily light not
to overload the road-bed and to get as
much force as possible in the drivers and
get a correspondingly large hauling pow-
er he put all the weight on the drivers

   the first engine which was made under
his directions was turned out by the
creusot works in t for service on
the bayonne and biarritz railway a
road which was used only by tourists as
the engine was then constructed the du-
ties of the engineer were rather compli-
cated and largely on this account it
was not made much use of on other roads
until the engineers duties were modified

  in those days mallet besides being
secretary of the academy of sciences was
engaged in all sorts of engineering prob-
lems and did not do much toward im-
proving his engine until almost ten years
later when the decauville engineering
works near paris called on him for a
design of an engine which could be used
on a portable railroad in military opera-
tions so he took his former design in
hand and made several marked improve-
ments especially in the gear reducing the
engineers duties practically to what they
are now

the pioneer of the type

   this mallet made in the early eight-
ies contained all the essentials of the
biggest mallets made to-day instead of
having three or four drive-wheels pro-
pelled by each cylinder it had only one 
but the design was the same as in the
latest improvements the frame which car-
ried the rear drivers and the rear or high-
pressure cylinder was rigidly attached to
the boiler and made secure in the usual


the railroad mans magazine

manner and the forward drivers and the
low-pressure cylinders were on an en-
tirely separate frame which was capable
of turning independently of the rear dri-
vers george l fowler a consulting
engineer of new york who saw the de-
cauville portable engine in operation
says it was in every way the same as the
huge mountain-climbers now in use on
the american railroads

   it was the first mallet i ever saw
he said in describing it  and it was so
small you could almost jump over it
except for the design you could not be-
lieve it was any relation to the monster
mallets they are turning out in this coun-
try nowadays

   the possibilities of the engine for
light work were apparent in an instant
when i saw it in operation it was haul-
ing a heavy cannon over a roadway that
was being laid but a few minutes ahead
of it it was an uneven country and for
the benefit of the test they were building
bridges and laying track from material
which had been torn up m the rear of the
locomotive as it passed there were al-
together only a few hundred yards of
track but this was built so rapidly that
the little mallet was able to keep going
faster than i could walk it was ex-
tremely unsteady and uneven as you can
imagine and the engine swayed back and
forth over all kinds of grades but either
the forward or the rear wheels would al-
ways keep going

  that capacity always to keep going is
what is making the mallet what it is com-
ing to mean to freight hauling on the
american mountains besides having
fifty per cent greater hauling power than
an ordinary engine of its own weight the
fact that the forward and the rear dri-
vers are worked by separate cylinders on
separate trucks makes it capable of forg-
ing its way steadily ahead even if one
set of drivers loses its grip on the track

a prophet without honor

  when mallet built the portable engine
he had in mind its possibilities for heav-
ier work-such work in fact as it has
been put to of recent years but at the
time he could not secure the attention of
the great railroad builders it might do
well enough for portable railways and

small mountain-climbing roads they
said but when it came to real railroad-
ing they could see nothing in the mallet

   this attitude on the part of railroad
men and the attempts mallet made to
break it down give his career a particu-
larly dramatic turn and then when it
was finally taken up by the railroads and
made use of as might have been done
years ago the glory of it was almost lost
to him there was a time when it first
came into prominence when it was
known by the names of two other men
and it was only because their names did
not stick in the memory as well as mal-
lets that he received the fame in the end

   science has recognized the value of his
contribution to the world from the be-
ginning he had no sooner placed his
engine in operation on the bayonne and
biarritz railway than the academy of
sciences presented him ivith a gold medal
and placed him among the most impor-
tant of its members then when the de-
cauville portable engine which he had
designed proved a success the french
society for the advancement of national
industries conferred on him another gold
medal

belated honors

  again when the engine was coming
into considerable use on the mountain
railroads of europe the same organiza-
tion in  gave him a second gold
medal for the same invention apparent-
ly as a double honor to offset the general
lack of credit and even america has
given him scientific honors but it was
done in such an unostentatious way that
no one ever heard about it

  the honor in this case however was
not given on account of the greatness of
his achievement but for a paper on the
subject of the mallet engine for this
the franklin institute of philadelphia in
 presented him with the elliott
cresson medal

  little good these honors do him to
the world at large and particularly to
railroad men he is absolutely unknown
that even his name would be lost he
feared himself and was put to the neces-
sity of writing to the leading engineer-
ing papers and correcting their mistake
when they fell into the habit of calling
his wonderful invention by the names of
other men

  but first he had to get his engine
recognized he has not been at any
time in his career either connected with
a railroad or with a locomotive company
and on that account it has been to the in-
terest of no one to make his invention
prominent when it finally won out it
was on sheer merit and mellin the man
who made it what it is to-day did not
even know the inventor he had seen
engines built on that design and that was
all

heart-breaking struggle

  if he had cared to mallet might have
used his position with the academy of
sciences to bring his invention more
prominently into notice but this he does
not appear ever to have done although
at various times scattered through a score
of years he wrote on it publicly and
proudly called attention to the few en-
gines of the type which were being suc-
cessfully used these articles always ap-
peared in the technical papers which had
no connection with the academy of
sciences

  he did however feel himself called
upon a number of times to point out in
technical papers the virtues of his en-
gine and suggest its wider use as late
as  only a short time before mellin
arrived at the same idea he wrote on the
subject in as nearly a bitter frame of
mind as a scientist could permit himself

  at this time-a quarter of a century
after -the engine was invented-but four
hundred were in existence and most of
those very small and on unimportant
lines still he spoke of them proudly
and showed how they had been success-
fully used

  the article was in the railroad the
most important of the french railway
publications but the readers of the
magazine were a a whole so little ac-
quainted with it that he went into elabo-
rate explanations of why he had invent-
ed it in the first place and what he had
done with it since among other things
he said

   i produced this type of engine to
furnish railroads a more powerful and
more economical engine than those now

in use without increasing the load on
the individual wheels or the resistance of
the locomotive on curves

  he might have added that the rail-
roads had not appreciated his efforts
instead he went on to say that the limit
of size for ordinary locomotives had
about been reached and intimated that
the railroads would soon be driven by
necessity into making general use of his
design in fact that happened

  within two years the baltimore and
ohio railroad decided that it needed
bigger engines to haul its trains over the
heavy grades it found that it was no
longer possible to put more weight on
the individual wheels as the road-bed
and the curves would not stand it the
only alternative was the mallet

beginning of the triumph

  but this did not become apparent at
once in spite of mallets efforts the
engine was only known as a little nar-
row-gage affair and it was due to the
ingenuity of mellin that it was made of
practical value on american roads

  mellin was the chief designer for the
american locomotive works and had a
considerable reputation as a locomotive
designer his fame since however has
grown to many times what it was before
when he first announced that he was go-
ing to supply the baltimore and ohio an
engine that could do the work of any
two engines then in the service his state-
ment was not taken very seriously

  when he said that it would be on the
mallet design railroad men who knew
what that was were even more skeptical
failure was predicted on every side un-
til the first of the big mallets was tried
and then it was immediately apparent
that a long step forward had been made

what the engine is

  this is all the more surprising viewed
in the light of later events when one
takes a look at the main features of the
mallet articulated compound engine it
would seem that always the things that
appeal to us as the most obvious improve-
ments when put into practise form the
largest stumbling-block to the credulity
of experts when first stated in theory


the railroad mans magazine

  the mallet engine is really two en-
gines in one that is two engines with
one boiler there are two sets of coupled
drivers and two pairs of cylinders

  the high - pressure cylinder and the
rear set of drivers are fixed rigidly to the
locomotive frame and the low-pressure
cylinders and forward drivers are swiv-
eled under the forward part of the en-
gine so as to act as a forward truck the
two gears are connected by a pivot just
forward of the high-pressure cylinders

  this arrangement obviously gives a
short rigid wheel-base while at the same
time giving a large tractive power by the
faot that the weight is on all the drivers
extending considerably beyond the rigid
wheel-base

  one of the chief advantages of this
arrangement is the elimination of the
slipping of drive-wheels if the drivers
of one section should slip the unbalanced
power is automatically equalized and the
slipping drivers are compelled to get a
fresh grip on the rails without loss of
energy to the whole

  by the american locomotive com-
panys system of compounding another
great advantage is obtained for the mal-
let engine when so desired the locomo-
tive can be operated as a single-expan-
sion engine and about twenty per cent
additional power gained

  the engineer can at will open a valve
which will cause the high-pressure cylin-
ders to exhaust directly into the atmos-
phere and will cause live steam to be
fed directly into the low-pressure cylin-
ders with this additional power the
tonnage that a mallet engine can move is
almost incredible

  operated as pushers they add enor-

mously to she capacity of ordinary en-
gines which helped by he mallet up the
grades can pull a much larger load over
the level than their average rating as
road engines the capacity is double that
of the ordinary engine they are now
being adapted for passenger service and
there is no reason to believe that the ad-
vantages they will show over the ordi-
nary passenger engine would be just as
pronounced as they have been in the
freight service

  already numbers of them have been
constructed by the american locomotive
company for foreign countries inclu-
ding south africa brazil france and
colombia

  the difference between foreign and
american railroads is noticeable here
the heaviest mallet engine built for for-
eign roads is that for the central south
african railways which has a total
weight of  pounds and a weight
on the drivers of  although the
tractive power of the engine built for the
central railway of brazil is larger the
total weight of  pounds being all
on the drivers the weight on the dri-
vers of the engine built for the erie rail-
road is  pounds

  mellins first mallet was four times as
large as those which had been made
abroad and last year one was made for
the southern pacific five times as big
now the baldwin locomotive works is
adapting it to the passenger service

  it took forty years for the railroads to
realize the value of the mallet and the
inventor has had comparatively little re-
turn on his patents if it had been taken
up twenty years ago as it should have
been he would have reaped a fortune

hats and baggage-cars

milliners responsible for the mush-
room hats are not happy for the ex-
press companies have given the business a
fatal slap in the face by so steadily advanc-
ing their rates on this kind of freight that
they are twice what they were in  and
complaint has been made to the interstate
commerce commission the matter is
therefore now under investigation the
executive of one of the companies says
 when we first began making rates on
womens hats the hats were small neat

compact affairs that looked like a pat of but-
ter and were fastened to the wearers head
with a bit of string we charged by the
pound at that time since then the hats
have been growing steadily in width length
height and the fourth dimension but they
havent grown an ounce in weight

  why five years ago you could get from
 to  womens hats into an ordinary

double doors out to get one in-san

bucephalus the avenger

by edward c fellowes

              drisko sniffed the cool breeze of free-
              dom but clancy was not outplayed

lancy was an artist at his
job the construction
gang was working up
alongside the pauguk
river double-tracking the
division in order to ac-
commodate the growing freight traffic
from the brass mills at fountainville it
was narrow between the river and the
bank and for three miles the steam
shovels had to gouge out on one side and
fill in on the other with five hundred
thousand yards of rip-rap to hold the fill
against the spring freshets

   there were three shovels in commis-
sion-two of an ordinary type and bu-
cephalus a monster fresh from the shops
with a capacity of ten cubic yards of earth
at a single bite and with steel fingers
along his bucket-jim for handling stone

  clancy was craneman on bucephalus
under the corrugated hood of the great
machine his engineer hoisted and lowered
on signal while the striker kept watch to
see that all was clear but it was clancy
perched upon his little platform half-
way up the arm of the big crane who
controlled the thrust of the dipper-bar
going just deep enough to fill the dip-
per at the highest point in its rise-
nibbling cunningly about the boulders
which now and then cropped out in the
bank  removing their visible means of
support until they were persuaded to

take a tumble when he would deftly
gather them in and swing them over to
the flats waiting in a long line for the
journey to the dump

  this was no greenhorns job it
took judgment born of long experience
and an eye which could measure dis-
tances to a hair to gage the cutting in
the bank load the dipper exactly full
so as to economize time and power and
draw tire latch at precisely the right mo-
ment as the crane swung the load over
the cars

  clancy possessing both eye and judg-
ment was therefore an artist he
thought of nothing but his job he
loved bucephalus whose first master he
was as though the monster were a clever
animal

  he would talk to him while at work
pat him and clean him and oil him
when off duty as though the future of
the pauguk road depended upon his be-
ing kept in good humor and condition

  one passion and one only besides
his love for bucephalus found room
in clancys soul being an irishman it
might be supposed that this was for
either mountain dew or a pretty girl
but the craneman never drank needing
the clearest of heads for his work and
as for women-he was a staid married
man with a growing family of his own

  clancy was deeply in love however


the railroad mans magazine

andthe object of his affections was an-
other irishman

  it would be hard to say what there
was in christy ohara to inspire the
sentiment he was built like a baboon
with great flat feet ungainly arms which
hung far below their proportionate
point he had fiery red hair growing
like bristles above a receding brow and
his china-blue eyes gave back the light
without a flash of soul

  he was boss of the train gang-a
small army of trimmers and shovelers
who were designated by numbers in-
stead of names and recruited from
many lands many of the gang were
italians a dozen or so however were
of those strange nationalities known to
ethnologists as lithuanians slovaks or
ruthenians for convenience usually
lumped together by the inaccurate under
the generic name of polacks ohara
contemptuously designated them as
 dagoes

  over this cosmopolitan aggregation
the train boss ruled his authority was
absolute his genius lay in  speed-
ing and  speed  them he did with
abundant language which uncompre-
hended save for its oaths drove all
hands for records in trimming and un-
loading while bucephalus and his hum-
bler mates supplied endless material for
their energies

  among the polacks was one drisko
drisko was cursed with imagination a
sullen-browed giant he was conscious of
generations of noble barbarian ances-
tors who had lived in castles in the
heart of bohemian forests busy with
raids forays and reprisals singing lays
of wild minstrelsy sleeping all night in
the form of the cross before cathedral
altars in order to consecrate in advance
their errands of robbery and bloodshed

  echoes of this past rang in the soul
of drisko a medieval soul dwelling in
a twentieth-century body compelled to
handle day after day a collins shovel
and endure the curses of a ribald irish-
man

   it was in this grotesque inappropriate-
ness of actor and setting that the germ of
tragedy was slowly ripening

  clancy and ohara were together
under shelter of the hood of bucephalus
on an afternoon too wet for work even

under the inexorable speed law of the
train boss the gang were in their
shanties scattered along the edges of the
cut clancy a bunch of waste in one
hand an oiler in the other paused in his
work about the engine and looked at
his chum

   jack me by the big dago has it in
for ye do ye watch out form

  ohara withdrew his pipe from the
corner of his mouth he glanced up
with affection at the craneman

   im watchin out all right all right
im not afeared of em

  clancy drew nearer

   yere not afeared of m i know it
and in a fair fight id back ye but twill
be no fair fight hell get ye some eve-
nin in the dark or lay yer out wid a
bar when yere unsuspectin hes look-
in every day for his chance an i warn
ye jack he added with a hand upon
oharas shoulder

  for the fraction of a second the train
boss allowed his stubbly cheek to rest
against the rough paw of his mate
then both men assumed an air of indif-
ference clancy mounted to his plat-
form and tried his levers and ohara
turning the collar of his jumper up
about his throat dropped from the car
and slushed off through the mud to-
ward his shack

  clancys warning was not thrown
away upon the train boss for some
time he had been conscious of unrest
among the crews there was nothing
overt as yet but the keen instinct of the
irishman accustomed to handling rough
gangs had smelled trouble in the air as
a sailor smells a storm

  long before his men were conscious
of it he felt the psychic disturbance and
knew that something was brewing with
watchful eye and ear he went about his
work day by day the train-crews
trimmed their cars fed by bucephalus
as diligently as ever day by day the
spur track advanced the river channel
straightened the rip-rap grew as the
bank disappeared and the fill progressed 
still nothing happened to justify
oharas suspicions

  too wise to seem anxious he made no
move himself as long as the work
went on according to specifications what
more did he want so he watched and
bucephalus the avenger



listened and speeded his gang with
drisko-cursed by his imagination his
medieval soul linked to his twentieth-
century shovel-at their head

   ohara did not distrust his suspi-
cions too often in the past he bad
known riot to spring up only after a
long period of incubation the quieter
things were the more he increased his
vigilance

   he kept rigid tally of his equipment
 prowled around the shan-
 ties at night to catch a
 chance word and still
 nothing he had little
 fear of his italians hot
 in temper they were and
 quick to flare up at a mo-
 ments notice but it was
 only a flare not a flame

as a rule they were
cheerful and willing

when he speeded
them they took a hitch
of their eternal leather
belts grasped their shov-
els a little more firmly
and with a grin added
one more notch to the
pace which deceptive in
its apparent deliberation
would continue unweary-
ing a n d unflagging for
hour after hour until
bucephalus b  e w his
whistle for knocking off

   of the polacks the boss
 was less trustful somber
 brooding their thought-
 ful eyes turned inward upon their past
 they seemed always to work under pro-
 test

   with these people it was likely to be
 a slumbering resentment cherished and
 fostered bursting suddenly into erup-
 tion which was to be feared ohara
 understood them less so lie watched
 them with greater care

   it was only after some weeks of cat-
like vigilance that the train boss came
upon anything which might be construed
to mean trouble scouting through the
brush near the shanties one night he
stumbled over a pile of weeds which
pulled apart revealed three kegs

  ohara kicked them they were
full how they got into the camp was

a mystery supplies for the men came
by rail and were unloaded under super-
vision of a company checker

  the nearest town was four miles away
the sole communication being through
the bakers wagon which once each
day delivered its tally of three hundred
long shiny loaves but these also were
counted as they came from the wagon
and nothing else could possibly be smug-
gled in with them

  still it was less the mystery than the
fact which troubled ohara for liquor
was strictly forbidden except under spe-
cial circumstances such as were defined
by the company

  the presence of these kegs was in di-
rect defiance of discipline ohara sat
down on one of them and ruminated
finally he rose with an air of decision
drew the weeds again over the pile and
set off toward his shack

   watch drisko that was the key
to the situation if trouble came it
would be through him for he alone pos-
sessed the qualities of a leader

  too much imagination was his defect
-an unpardonable defect in such a man
he should have been an automaton with

             

ohara kicked them they were full


the railroad mans magazine

a number  he insisted upon being a liv-
ing creature which thought for this
reason the train boss bore him a grudge
which showed itself only in the pale fire
of his irish eyes as he  speeded the
gang and was recognized by drisko
only in the sullen glow of his own dark
orbs

  the antagonism was there however-
a continual throwing down of the gaunt-
let and a continual acceptance of the
challenge-nothing wanting but oppor-
tunity for the outbreak

  the day after the discovery of the
hidden kegs work began apparently as
usual with no signs of anything aside
from the ordinary routine

  time had been lost by two days of
rain and must be made up somehow
and ohara was the man to see that it
was made up when he began to call
for speed he noticed among his men an
air which attracted his attention not
among the italians who responded to
the extra pressure with the accustomed
grin but among the polacks

  drisko wore a expression more nearly
resembling insolence than he had ever
shown the others seemed to watch
him casting furtive sidelong glances
from time to time as if expecting a sig-
nal and adding little if any energy to
their operations under the sting of the
language produced by ohara for their
benefit

  the dump was half a mile from the
point where the steam-shovels were at
work in the cut at the particular spot
where the cars were unloading the tem-
porary track ran close to the river with
scant space for a man to stand between
the outer rail and the steep bank slo-
ping to the waters edge

  as the first train-load stopped the
boss was standing in this narrow strip
and as it happened just abreast of
driskos car

  the crew hastened to remove the side-
boards and a heavy plank carelessly
handled slipped from the stakes and
struck ohara bruising him from hip
to ankle and all but sending him into
the river

  scrambling to his feet his eyes ablaze
his tongue unloosed the angry man
shook his fist at drisko pouring out a
torrent of invective against polacks in

general and drisko in particular the
big foreigner leaning on his shovel
watched him like a cat

  incensed by this calmness ohara
foolishly passed the limit by using a sin-
gle epithet in the polack jargon which
conveyed the deepest possible insult in
a moment drisko leaped the heavy steel
shovel swung high above his mighty
shoulders descending with a crash upon
the skull of the unfortunate boss and
driving his body like a log to the foot
of the embankment there it lay half
in the water a red tinge spreading slow-
ly in the stream

  in a second bedlam was loose the
italians huddling together with pop-
ping eyes jabbered like monkeys the
polacks rushed to driskos car where
the giant holding aloft his fatal shovel
stood like a vengeful colossus

  seized with uncontrollable panic he
threw down his weapon and fled running
along the loaded train leaping from car
to car it was this course which proved
his undoing there was quick irish wil-
in the cab of the switcher coupled as it
happened midway of the train ten cars
behind and the same number before

  yelling to his fireman to cut loose
from those in the rear murphy the in-
stant his engine was free threw his
throttle wide for full speed the long
line of loosely coupled flats joggled with
a sudden commotion which upset the
fleeing polack

  he lost his balance and fell clutch-
ing wildly his arms buried to the elbows
in the soft earth of the load

  when he regained his feet the train
had gathered such headway that he dared
not jump yet to remain where he was
would be fatal for already the cut was
in sight a minute more would bring
him into the midst of the grading gang

  drisko was paralyzed behind him
the engine shrieked a succession of short
piercing blasts that spoke of danger
murphy was calling for help drisko
looking up the track toward the sound
could see men running from their work

  clancy at his post on bucephalus
leaned far out from his platform and
peered under his hand at the rocking
cars as they roared out into the open the
crouching figure of the polack at the
front abreast of bucephalus murphy
bucephalus the avenger



gave her the air the train
brought up with a crash which
caused the light single-truck
flats to buckle and rear like
broncos and drisko unpre-
pared shot sprawling to
ground	

  he was up in an instant run-
ning like a hare as murphy
shouted the news to the amazed
spectators at once the hunt was
on down the track fled the po-
lack a group of shovelers ran
at him from the ditch back again in
and out among the shanties dodging
among the tool-boxes dropping to the
ground to slip under the cars - but at
every point there rose a figure with pick
or bar to head him off

  the circle was closing there was
open space on one side-toward the bank
drisko darted that way upsetting a sin-
gle opponent up the slope clinging
crawling sliding digging with toes and
claws-his heart pounding the breath
whistling in his chest a wild hope be-
fore him of reaching the top of the bank
and seeing the open country of freedom

  taken by surprise for a few moments
no one made a move to follow him sud-
denly they rushed the bank in pursuit
overhead drisko turned and cursed
them he threw stones upon their
heads and lie dashed handfuls of sand
into their eyes

  blinded and at a disadvantage they
faltered in the sliding earth drisko
turned again like a wild-cat at the bank

  he fought his way up with nails with
elbows with knees

  the fringe of green turf along the
edge of the slope the grass waving in the
breeze grew nearer nearer still

drisko shot to
the ground

  almost up a moment now and he
would be safe

  a huge black shadow enveloped him
he looked poised in the air over his
head was the great bucket of bucepha-
lus it swung swiftly down and rested
 the edge of the bank in front of
him barring the way

  drisko glared he turned and looked
down and saw clancy standing on his
platform half - way up the arm of the
crane his hands on the levers his face
white- as paper his eyes riveted upon
the figure above

  cold sweat trickled upon the polack
a mortal terror clamped its hand upon
his heart he knew clancys friend-
ship for the dead man he knew how
the huge machine responded like a liv-
ing thing to the will of the craneman-
and hope deserted him

  he rested his gaze fixed on the wait-
ing groups below desperate anger
seized him he shouted and shook his

fist at the great steel bulk which stood tion he knew that it had a definite
between him and freedom then like radius of operation beyond which it
lightning he dashed up the slope trying could not go until its car was moved
to skirt the bucket before clancy was along the track

aware of his purpose	but bucephalus was already at the

  but the irishman was ready for him end of the spur which ran out into the
the bucket lifted a little from its place sand at the base of the hill drisko took
brushed silently along the grassy edge courage safety could yet be found in
and came to rest again just in front of one direction-away from the zone within
drisko he waited then he tried the which the crane was free to act
sarnie tactics in the opposite direction the cunning polack edged an inch
and again the bucket floated quietly be- toward the left the movement passed
fore him barring his path	unnoticed another inch clancy did

  drisko began to grow calmer with a not stir he might make it with a rush
deadly calm clancy was prolonging the in order to disarm suspicion he stretched
agony he was playing with him-de- himself as though in utter exhaustion-
laying the moment when he would finally he spread-eagled on the slope
finish him	to the watchers below it seemed as if

  the men at the foot of the bank knew he had given up instead he was gather-
this they were watching they knew ing all his energies for the final effort
clancy he would do the trick	he rolled his bloodshot eyes upward

  drisko looked at the bucket and began ten feet it was not far if he could
to think he measured the bank with his make it he was safe clancy could not
eye pie regarded the crane with atten- touch him he must make a diagonal

for thus he would gain
both in lateral distance
and height

  lying motionless dris-
ko contracted toes and
fingers as they clutched
the soil suddenly he
sprang

  five feet eight feet
he would make it one
more supreme effort

  clancy had been taken
by surprise anticipating
a move in the opposite di-
rection where the bank
was less steep he was un-
prepared for the cunning
exhibited by the polack
but he acted like light-
ning

  already his crane was
swung to the left as far
as it could go he thrust
the bucket-bar after the
fleeing drisko the great
scoop swinging at its end
for once his eye played
him false the bucket
struck short of its mark
and checked impotently a
foot behind its object

  a yell of triumph burst
from the polack with-

mark
bucephalus the avenger



out seeing it he felt the failure of clancy
to seize him another short scramble and
he was safe he could almost feel the
free air of the open country blowing
about his ears and in the ecstasy of his
joy he turned in his tracks to shake his
fist at the baffled engineer

  the move was fatal to the unfortunate
drisko though clancy had been checked
in his last effort he was not yet out-
played

  the bucket slid swiftly down upon its
cable again it started in its ascent its
steel lip bit deep into the bank behind
and beneath the exulting fugitive it
swung aside leaving a huge cavity and
into the opening buried in tons of slip-

ping sliding soil whirled the helpless
form of the polack with staring eyes and
clutching hands

  clancy drew the latch and the bucket
yawned and disgorged its load the
hinged bottom slammed shut

  once more the boom shot out once
more the steel lip bit into the bank-the
cable singing through its pulley the
great crane turned upon the pivot-and
when clancy drew the latch there
plunged headlong to the ground amid
the group of waiting men the limp and
crumpled body of drisko who should
have been an automaton with a number
but who had insisted upon being a crea-
ture which thought

rights of a shipper

a shipper was recently threatened
with direful consequences in fort
worth because he dared open his car and
inspect his own goods which will likely
bring to a constitutional test at once the
question of shippers rights

  an oklahoma man consigned a car-load of
corn to himself in fort worth and ar-
rived on a passenger-train several hours be-
fore the freight the bill of lading as usual
went to the bank but by the time the corn
was ready for inspection the bank was
closed and the shipper was unable to prove
ownership to the car in the prescribed way
he informed the railroad officials that he
would open the car and inspect the corn
without this formality they threatened to
institute legal proceedings if he should
break- theseal on the car-door not deterred
by these threats he entered the car and took
a long look at his corn whereupon the rail-

roads attorneys announced that the court
would be appealed to

  a proceeding of this kind will bring into
the courts the question of a shippers au-
thority over his cargo the judiciary will
decide whether the shipper can break a seal
on a car and look at the contents before
proving ownership to that car even though
as in this instance the proof is locked in a
bank vault and the cargo needs attention

  this is the first time in the history of
texas railroads that such a pointed instance
has arisen and railroad men as well as
shippers over the southwest will watch the
outcome

 the railroads have good reasons for
refusing to allow these seals to be broken
for instance if the wrong man should open
a car of corn the original shipper or con-
signee might turn it back on the railroad and
force the company to pay damages

power for the great northern

great northern engineers have be-
gun work in the lake chelan district
for development of  horse-power of
clcctrical energy to be used in operating the
western division of the railroad title to the

the great northern is now running its
trains through the cascade mountain tunnel
by electric power but the leavenworth
station which supplies the current develops
only  horse-power it is one of the

by arthur b reeve

back ill the early s when almost every other man said that a railroad
across the mountains of the far west joining east and west was an
absolute impossibility theodore d judah stolidly took the other view
even in the face of seeming insurmountable financial and engineering obsta-
cles nothing could thwart the purpose of that great man he simply said
 it must be built i zvill build it

     and he did the story of the winning of the west has been told many
times but theodore d judah deserves the  nations crown of glory but
for him a work which has inspired the admiration of engineers and the pens
of romancers might have been delayed for years

     he was a maker of railroads and a maker of history

how theodore d judah saw the possibility and turned the dream
of joining the east and the west by rail into reality
by hard work and indomitable purpose

ho was the father of
our transcontinental
railroads perhaps
you have thought it
was leland stanford
or collis p hunting-
ton or mark hopkins or charles
crocker or maybe all of them combined
they indeed have had the credit-and
in after years whatever debit there was
too for this early example of how a
great project can be ultimately  high
financed

  then too there were the dreamers of
the fifties who talked long and confi-
dently of their schemes to unite the two
oceans - asa whitney hartwell car-
ver and the rest though they never
really built a mile of the roads they have
received precious little credit for getting
people interested in the idea

  but the real father of the pacific roads
the man who made practicable the plans
of the dreamers and actually interested
the money of the doers-the man who lit-
erally gave his life to the project-he to

whom credit is really due is a manwhose
name you will not find in any of the
biographical dictionaries or histories-
theodore d judah

  if this article succeeds in restoring his
name to its rightful place in railroad his-
tory it will have accomplished its pur-
pose any one who cares to delve back
in the dusty files of congress in the early
sixties or the time-stained first reports of
the old central pacific can verify the
work done by mr judah

intended for the navy

  theodore dehone judah was born in
bridgeport conuecticut march  
he was the son of the rector of st
johns episcopal church his father
came of an early connecticut family
his mother was from virginia and tlie
boy was named for an uncle theodore
dehone bishop of the episcopal church
of that state his fathers closest friend

  mr judahs parents intended that he
should enter the navy but he did not re-
the founder of the c p



ceive the expected appointment he was
then sent to the troy polytechnic insti-
tute also known as rensselaer which
was then the only school of its kind in
the world

  there he was educated for engineering
and while he was still a student at troy
 tech  his father died and he had to
take care of himself

  the railroad was then a new industry
it fascinated him his first position was
on the engineering staff of the troy and
schenectady railroad his career rapidly
broadened neit he went to the new
haven hartford and springfield rail-
road the connecticut river railway and
the buffalo and new york railway now
known as the erie

  his next position was on the erie
canal where he built a section between
jordan and seneca falls new
from there he undertook the
construction of the niagara
gorge railroad this was dis-
cussed widely in the newspapers
of the time as a feat

  it attracted the attention of
some people of sacramento cal-
ifornia who were looking for an
engineer to build a road from
sacramento to the gold - dig-
gings of folsom judah was
recommended by horatio sey-
mour of utica afterward gov-
ernor of new york and was
hired by colonel charles l

wilson of sacramento thus
he came to be associated with
the great work of opening up
the pacific coast by railroad

  when he was only sixteen he
had been inspired by the agita-
tion of asa whitney for the
construction of a railroad across
the continent whitney was
an engineer of note who had
worked  railroads in the mo-
hawk valley in new york he
had been canal commissioner a
former president of the read-
ing a partner of matthew bald-
win in founding the baldwin
locomotive works and the
inventor of the process for
making cast-iron annealed car-
wheels which made them dura-
ble and safe

  during the fifties whitney had advo-
cated the building of a railroad westward
from lake michigan across the plains
through the south pass of the rockies
and then over the sierras to san fran-
cisco

  john c fremont had traversed the
route and had declared such a project
feasible senator thomas c benton
had already introduced a bill in con-
gress for a national highway across the
continent by rail wherever possible by
wagon elsewhere but it had not been
passed in  congress ordered sur-
veys made and five routes were laid out
-all of which by the way are now
approximately followed by the great
transcontinental lines

  whitneys scheme was utterly fantastic
he expected the government in the first

york place to agree to give him in all ninety-

theodore d judah

by whose untiring work the central pacific road
was constructed


the railroad mans magazine

two million acres of public lands as he
carried his road ahead dr carvers
scheme was equally if not more ex-
travagant even at this early date there
were those who saw through such de-
mands like william m hall who be-
lieved with george wilkes that the gov-
ernment could best construct the road
itself

  others - like plumbe loughborough
and degrand-proposed equally injudi-
cious schemes judah was convinced that
private enterprise should do it but that
government aid of a more moderate kind
would be sufficient in  the repub-
lican party was pledged in its platform
to accomplish this undertaking

  in those early days in california mr
judah was the leading engineer in all
railway enterprises after completing
the sacramento valley railroad-thirty-
two miles to folsom-in february s
he undertook to interest capitalists of
san francisco in the project of a trans-
continental road failing there he de-
voted his time to the moneyed men of
sacramento he believed that the road
should be pushed eastward overcoming
first the most difficult obstacles that with
the sierras surmounted the rockies and
the plains were easy the remainder of
his life was devoted to this work

  all of his time from the spring of
 to the fall of s was spent in
washington lobbying for a bill grant-
ing public lands for this purpose con-
gress at that time was torn by sectional
strife between north and south and in
no mood to seriously consider uniting
east and west little real interest was
paid to judahs plans

called in the public

  when congress finally adjourned in
 mr judah returned to the pacific
cdast to take up the fight at the other end
there he organized a convention of dele-
gates from almost every county of cali-
fornia oregon washington and ari-
zona it was a large and enthusiastic
convention and he was the spirit of it

  he laid before them all the informa-
tion he had gathered on the various routes
available and they chose one over which
the central pacific was substantially con-
structed as first outlined by him

  he was appointed by the convention its
official agent to proceed to washington
present copies of the proceedings to the
president the cabinet and congress and
urge the passage of an act that would
insure the construction of the road

  for the two following winters he la-
bored in washington making but slow
progress then the war broke out it
was evident that such a period was any-
thing but favorable to such a project so
he returned to the coast

  although he had spent over 
the only expense bill he submitted was
forty dollars for printing meanwhile
he was organizing his forces in califor-
nia to continue the agitation in washing-
ton

  failing to convince san francisco he
succeeded in interesting a group of mer-
chants in sacramento they organized
the central pacific railroad company
on june  j under the laws of cali-
fornia it had a capital stock of -

	in shares of  each

the original owners

  the articles of association show nine
persons-leland stanford who dealt in
provisions and groceries charles crock-
er who with his brother ran a dry-goods
store including a job-print shop  collis
p huntington and mark hopkins part-
ners iiv the hardware business james
bailey l a booth d w strong
charles marsh and theodore d judah

  among the first subscribers for stock
bailev crocker hopkins huntington
judah and stanford each took 
shares the others less stanford was
the president huntington vice-presi-
dent hopkins treasurer e h miller
jr secretary e b crocker attorney
and judah chief engineer they were
also the first directors

  judah organized engineering parties
and ran barometric lines over twenty or
more suggested routes all the results
tallied with his first observation that
donner pass was the easiest way over
the sierras both for distance and grade

  he proposed to follow the truckee
river from the outlet jf lake donner
about fourteen miles north of lake ta-
hoe and then go through the eastern
range of the sierras and the humboldt
the founder of the c p



desert the distance from san fran-
cisco to the truckee river was  miles
and to the state line  miles

more work in washington

  his report having been made mr ju-
dah was again sent to washington he
met the members of the house and sen-
ate committees on the pacific railroad
and was appointed secretary to both com-
mittees with the privilege of the floor in
both houses after many compromises
the pacific railroad act was passed july
 

  the original act provided briefly for
the construction of a railroad and tele-
graph line from the pacific coast at or
near san francisco to the eastern bound-
ary of california across nevada and to
the missouri

  for all practical purposes it was as if
simultaneously from the wilds of western
nebraska at about omaha and from
sacramento two roads - one westward
the other eastward-were to be built-
the union and central pacific respec-
tively-until they met

  the war seriously interfered with the
union pacific project and though the
first tracks were laid with much cere-
mony little was done to push it five
branches had been planned to the largest
western cities along the mississippi and
missouri at that time eight or ten
thousand prairie schooners carrying year-
ly  or more pounds of freight
set out from the frontier cities the
only other way was by panama the
need was therefore pressing and grow-
ing rapidly

the issue of bonds

  the secretary of the treasury was in-
structed to issue bonds to the company
constructing the roads at the following
rates from the coast to the sierras
about  miles at the rate of 
a mile across the sierras about 
miles at the rate of  a mile
across the great basin about  miles
at the rate of  a mile across the
rockies about  miles at the rate of
 a mile east of the rockies
about  miles at the rate of 
a mile

   figuring the public land at about pen
million acres bringing at least  an
acre it will be seen that very substantial
aid was thus given without the subscrip-
tion of much private capital the total
cost was supposed likely to come to -
 and each road was to bear ap-
proximately half

   the central pacific also received fur-
ther grants from other sources the
state of california agreed to guarantee
the interest on bonds to the extent of
 for twenty years which alone
was calculated to amount to 
the city of san francisco made a loan
of  of city gold bonds at seven
per cent for thirty years and sacramento
gave thirty acres including  feet of
water-front worth some  pri-
vate stock subscriptions at various times
up to the completion of the road amount-
ed to four millions more

  this original act provided that the
company must build the first fifty miles
within two years following its accept-
ance of the terms and fifty miles addi-
tional each succeeding year in de-
cember six months after the passage of
the act the company assumed the re-
sponsibility of carrying it out mr
judah lost no time in filing with the
secretary of the interior the necessary
maps and papers relating to the route
so as to secure the withdrawal from sale
of land along the line

           many obstacles

                                      

  he made arrangements in new york
for rails and other equipment for the
first fifty miles all this had to be
shipped by sea it was ten months be-
fore it reached san francisco though
the grading was actually begun the fol-
lowing february it was not until octo-
ber that the first equipment arrived in
sacramento

  nothing can better demonstrate the
character of mr judahs services than
the following letter which was sub-
scribed to by forty-two members of con-
gress and seventeen senators

   passage of the central pacific railroad
   bill through congress your explora-
   tions and surveys in the sierra nevada
   mountains have settled the practica-

surveys were again made in october

	and five possible routes over the
sierras were laid out for final considera-
tion according to the last report made
by mr judah july   that
chosen lay from sacramento to auburn
illinoistown dutch flat and by don-
ner pass the first fifty miles carrying it
to new england mills

  he gave the estimated cost of this
first division for grading masonry
bridging ties track-laying locomotives
cars machinery shops and all other con-
tingencies as  including a
large bridge over the american river

  there were six passenger - cars two
baggage-cars twenty-five box cars and
twenty-five fiat cars the rails were twen-
ty - four feet long and weighed sixty
pounds to the yard  tons being the
first order the ties were of redwood
 for the first section

  after the first eighteen miles was com-
pleted and running seven months ending
november  the road had carried
 passengers its receipts were

  operating expenses 
and net profit  not a bad first

report

  trains ran at an average speed of twen-
ty-two miles an hour including stops
the vhole fifty miles were completed
september b time being extended

  when it had become evident that in
spite of the energy with which the work
was being pushed the first-fifty miles
could not be completed within the orig-
inal two years fixed by congress judah
again sailed for washington october

	to secure an amendment to the act

  he chose the quickest route panama
and while crossing the isthmus was
stricken with panama fever he died in
new york november   a martyr
to one of the greatest industrial projects
the world has ever known his place
was taken bv samuel s montague as
acting chief engineer

he made history

  mr judah married anne pierce of
greenfield massachusetts may  
in st jamess church of that village
she died september   they left
ii children his nephew h r judah
is now assistant general passenger agent
of the southern pacific in san francisco


  though he died at the very outset the
work he began was bound to go on to
completion the final meeting of cen-
tral and union pacific and the driving
of the last spike at promontory a few
miles west of ogden utah on may 
- miles from omaha and 
from san francisco-the rise and domi-
nance of the powerful system the build-
ing of other transcontinental systems-
seven of them now-the reorganization
of union and southern pacific and the
entrance of harriman-these are now
but the nuggets of history

  theodore dehone j udah was the real
founder pie was the most influential
advocate and he had the brains his
manifold talent in engineering and in
interesting practical men of politics and
finance really made possible the stretch-
ing of the first great steel arms across

would have stood forth as one of the
great figures in american railroading

   belcher snarled as he turned away from
the table that was wilkess facetious
way of saying  good morning  over the
telegraph wire it made him tired

  everything made belcher tired he
rose wearily and shuffled out to the little
platform of raynor station twelve
years of looking at that platform had
made him dead tired

   he looked around down the line east-
ward belfield presumably sweltering in
the heat and twenty miles away up
the line bradford another twenty miles
away north an endless strip of flat
middle west country uninhabited offer-
ing  excuse for existence save as a
haven for some solitude-loving salaman-
der quivering just now in the awful sun
southward precisely the same thing with
the main road a mile away and out of
sight and the heat quivering more vio-
lently if possible

   oh yes it was unusually warm that
day belcher reflected as he glanced at
the thermometer and npted that in the
shade it stood just  it was hot
enough to make a man sit down again so
belcher sat on the edge of the platform
his face in his dry palms

   	r r

   poor old belcher at thirty he looked
forty-and felt fifty he had entered the
w and e service right here at raynor
when eighteen years of age a graduated
telegrapher at twelve dollars a week

   he had also assumed the duties of sta-
tion freight and express agent porter
ticket-clerk track-walker and informa-
tion bureau to the two or three dozen who
detrained there monthly and he still
earned twelve dollars a week

   not that he had not been buoyant and
ambitious at first why at first he would
have bet ten years of his existence that
hed be chief train-despatcher at the very
least by this time but the monotony of
the thing the heat in summer and the cold
in winter the twice-a-day tramp with the
station and benkers shabby farmhouse
at the respective ends had worked into
belcher

   he had saved money weekly to the
tune of six dollars to be sure but after
the first year he had no mortal idea of
why he was saving it he knew nobody
and he saw nobody and he spent nothing
unable even after experimentation to
cultivate a taste for strong drink and so
drown his monotony he was a total ab-
stainer and a total everything else it
seemed to belcher

   what he wanted was to get out of ray-
nor station or get a substantial raise at
least and he hadnt ambition left to run
down either hed written four times in
the last six years to the president himself
and received no answer hed spoken to
his immediate boss and been told to fade
away-that a good yellow pup for a
watch-dog could attend to things at ray-
nor and that twelve dollars a week was a
hideous waste of money


the railroad mans magazine

  now with the blazing eastern rails
blinding his near-sighted eyes belcher re-
called drearily that he hadnt had ambi-
tion enough to argue the thing what
he needed was spunk monotony had
knocked the last bit out of him that was
all belcher groaned aloud as he realized
it through the flood of perspiration pie
was lost dead lost-at thirty

  his head had a queer feeling too he
rubbed it stupidly probably it was the
heat belcher didnt care much he only
wished he had the president sitting there
in that soundless hell to talk things over
and say that he was sorry the matter
hadnt been attended to before and that
hed raise belcher at least five dollars at
once if he didnt say that belcher had
a notion that hed throttle him

  with another groan belcher shuffled
to the end of the platform and extracted
from the closet something of his own con-
trivance-a sledge and a strip of iron
with a small spike at either end whether
he felt lazy or not hed have to pull to-
gether that crack in the tie next the switch
and keep it from spreading wide open
before the track repairers finally worked
around to replacing the tie-some seventy
or eighty years hence

  wearily he shuffled across the track
and looked the thing over yes about
two weeks more or a good rain and
thered be one tie split in two and a loose
rail

  why the devil didnt the company keep
up their road what did he care whether
their stock was a mere two-per-cent solu-
tion of the first issue

  wrath surged up within belcher he
glared at the switch and the green and
red and white eyes glared back with a
sort of fiendish grin at the twelve-dollar
derelict

  recognizing the insult as personal to
himself belcher suddenly raised his
sledge and smashing the lamps left the
remains at an angle of perhaps fifteen
degrees from the earth

  he felt decidedly better

  at least he felt better for an instant
until he glanced back and realized with a
sort of sickly mirth that hed locked the
switch tight and the westward local due
in ten or twelve minutes couldnt get into
her siding to let the east-bound express
go by

  there was no way of fixing it 
mechanism of that particular s
locked or open usually declined to
ate with anything less than a ha
and now it was twisted and brok
bits still more the morning expre
on mighty close time and-

   what the dickens are you doing  a
loud voice buzzed into his spinning brain

  belcher turned quickly he stared
he stared harder still as certainly as
he breathed it was president bullton
black-clad puffy red-faced the very
gentleman with whom belcher had want-
ed to hobnob-or slaughter 

   that was deliberate destruction of
the companys property  thundered the
bulky man  i saw it-

  momentarily he saw no more bel-
chers hard fist struck him in the region
of the solar plexus and he sprawled back-
ward with the lone station-agent doing a
wild war-dance over him

  mr bullton did not struggle for the
time he was altogether too dazed belcher
stepped back and laughed somewhat wild-
ly inspiration had fairly blasted into
his dulled brain

  there was his strip of iron to hold the
tie together there was his sledge there
was bulltons motionless foot and ankle
laid mathematically along the tie

  in five seconds belcher was down on his
knees and had the spiked strip clapped
over the silk-shod ankle in another five
seconds the spikes themselves were driven
fast with a nice calculation that would
allow them to be pried off in ten seconds
but driven deeply endugh that bullton
might struggle until he was exhausted
unless he found a tool within reach

  belcher tossed the sledge a dozen feet
away and grinned at his captive-grinned
for a minute only he sobered quite sud-
denly to be sure he had bullton pinned
down in such fashion that he was in
 danger whatever for the switch was
locked at both ends  but-the two trains

  his head cleared up curiously and he
bounded across the tracks to the station
and into the closet he came out with
flags and bulging pockets and ran up
track a little he torpedoed the rails
very thoroughly and planted red flags be-
tween them pie raced back to the sta-
tion and halted a minute as he heard the
ravnor call
gone mad with the heat



  he answered then he fell back with
a sort of whooping laughing sigh of re-
lief the local was stalled away down
at belfleld and would wait for the ex-
press to pass there

  so it was all right nobody risked
being killed after all and as suddenly
as the tension had been put on him just
as suddenly it snapped and belcher be-
gan chuckling and rubbing his head

  he would stop the express

  hed throw his job gently into the air
and ride down to belfield on the express
hed have to throw the job now anyway
hed draw the accumulated hundreds that
derived from the weekly six-dollar money-
order mailed every saturday night for
twelve years at raynor post-office hed
go to new york and buy seven suits of
clothes and an automobile and raise all
thunderation for a week-and then com-
mit suicide he certainly would hed
do just that he needed a little change

  but-but what the deuce had he for-
gotten just in the last few minutes

  oh yes hed nailed down the presi-
dent of the road to one of his own sidings
that was it well hed go out and have
a chat with him and scare him just for
fun

  quite happily therefore belcher tripped
through the awful heat to where the
bulky man lay prostrate exhausted after
a fruitless struggle with his bond belcher
squatted cheerfully beside him remarking

   well old president bullton hows
things coming 

   lemme up  came hoarsely from the
captive

    aw wait a while said belcher pleas-
antly  the train isnt due for two or
three minutes

  the what

   the train thats going to come into
this siding full speed and make you into
sausage meat the station-man explained
cheerily

  a shriek rose from the red dripping
man

  great scott he screamed im
not bullton if you mean the president of
this road im the secretary of a casket
company that-

   youll get one cheap then belcher
commented

   -is thinking of building near here
i just drove over from raynor to look at

your freight platform and meet some of
your business men-

   so youre not bullton  gasped bel-
cher with what seemed to him excellently
quick and reasonable thought  well
then if youre not bullton -he reached
for the sledge- the best thing i can do
is to wipe you right out now

  a hoarse yell for help died away

 because if youre not explained the
station-man  youll go to work and tell
bullton about this and ill lose my job
 well  am bullton  choked the
prostrate figure  im bullton and-

   yes i thought you was bullton
said belcher dryly as he sat down again
 well im belcher remember bel-
cher 

    oh yes 

   then why didnt you answer one o
those four letters-hey didnt i ask
you politely to give me a transfer to some
live station or give me a good raise if i
had to stay here  

   why-they-they must have been
overlooked i think stuttered the other
 -meant to give them attention of
course but-

   but it wasnt worth while eh it
was all right to leave me down here with-
out even a human being to look at from
early morning till late at night it was
all right for me not to have a porter all
right for me to be doing laborers work
all right for me to be tending to die
express business and breaking my back
with big boxes and galloping back to the
key all that for twelve a week- and not
a cent of raise in twelve years oh it
was all right but its got you tied down
good and tight now and-by ginger the
express is coming 

   whatever your name is let me up
ill give you a raise ill give you a raise
to commence the day you look the job
i swear i will ill-

   oh no   said mr belcher who was
enjoying things with a sweetly clear con-
science as he observed anew the locked
switches  you think it over in the next
world see if flowers for the livin arent
better than flowers for people youve
killed off and still made em keep on
living

   man i-

   why if your old watered-stock road
had spent the price of double-tracking


the railroad mans magazine

through here you wouldnt be where you
are now

  then oddly brakes began to scream
and hiss and a big train loomed up from
the west slowed down and came to a halt

  passengers were looking out of the
windows they began pouring out right
in front was cousin tom who drew a
fat salary in the claims department he
gripped belcher by the shoulder and
dragged him aside after one look at the
captive

  did-you-do-that cousin tom
demanded in one word

   certainly said belcher calmly
 thats bullton he wouldnt give me
a raise i was playing a joke on him i-
 shut up  hissed the claims man
 thats no more bullton than you are
although he looks a little like him bull-
tons right over there in his private car
reading a paper he- cousin tom
glanced back at the streams that were
filing curiously from the train and dashed
the drops from his brow with a whis-
pered 

   go crazy  

   huh said belcher

   wiggle wiggle you idiot throw

your arms about in the air wiggle i
say wiggle 

  belcher wiggled indeed he found it
amazingly easy to wiggle just then he
wiggled up down and sidewise he wig-
gled in sweeping curves short curves
wide angles and very acute angles his
head wiggled to his own perfect satisfac-
tion for it was spinning gaily around
with the root of his neck for a pivot

 cousin tom was waving back the
people he took a terrible compelling
grip on belcher as he whispered  now
laugh to beat blazes 

  belcher laughed obediently he laughed
softly and nicely at first he felt that he
could do better and laughed at the top
of his lungs he caught sight of the
figure nailed to the switch and he laughed
frenziedly furiously and with more real
enjoyment than he had ever known in
his life before

  he had a notion that cousin tom was
saying in silly fashion

   its all right gentlemen if one of
youll please give me a hand getting him
to the baggage-car its all right sir
thank you hes just gone temporarily
mad with the heat 

moving-platforms for new york

a neglected form of transportation that may get a good try-out
in the metropolis

the serious consideration by the public
service commission of new york of
the plan to install a moving-platform in a
subway under broadway between four-
teenth street and forty-second street calls
renewed attention to this system of trans-
portation although recognized as the most
efficient means of transporting passengers
it has been employed only at expositions
such as that at chicago in  and at paris
in  and possibly for this reason has
often been considered somewhat in the light
of a freak

  nevertheless as shown by the report of
mr seaman engineer for the commission
a moving-platform of the type proposed for
new york has not only a capacity very much
in excess of that of the combined rush-hour
service of the local and express trains of the
present subway but for distances of four
miles gives more rapid service than the

present local service on the subway and
even the local and express service combined

  the two principal objections from a trans-
portation standpoint which have been raised
against the moving-platform are  that
it requires a certain amount of agility to pass
from the slow-speed platforms to the high-
speed platform and that this is not possessed
by everybody and  that the carrying
capacity of the moving-platform is constant
so that the same service must be run at non-
rush hours as at rush-hour periods

 there are also some objections from an
engineering standpoint and perhaps the
principal one based on the experience at
chicago and paris is noise for these rea-
sons there has been considerable reluctance
to install the system in any place other than
at a fair-ground or similar locality where
the patrons need not ride unless they wish
to do so-electric railway journal
with the veterans of the erie

by peter mulligan

perhaps no road in the country is so rich in capable and experienced
veterans as is the erie consequently a day among the erie veterans
can be depended  to unfold to one a vista of early-dav railroading
hard to find anywhere else it is impossible to railroad for forty or fifty years
without having experiences that thrill amuse sadden and mellow but to
get at the stories of those experiences is another matter

     if the average man asks an old railroad man about the things that have
happened to him the veteran probably will say that life has been pretty hum-
drum and that he cannot recall anything worth relating that is the dif-
ference betw een the man who can collect stories and the man who would go
over the richest ground and never scent one

     mr mulligan is one of the men who can go among the old-timers and get
the stories of their experiences in the only natural and effective manner
stories told under these conditions are the only stories worth telling read
these and see if you dont agree with us

memories revived in the old clubhouse of the days when railroad-
ing was a business that needed the courage of a soldier
and the strength of an athlete

f youre riding on the erie and
a gray-haired conductor comes
along to take up your ticket
follow him to his lair and get
him to talking it will be
worth the fare  matter how
far you are going he will have a hun-
dred stories to tell and they will all be
good ones

  there are forty of these veterans on
the new york division alone who come
together every lav in a clubroom near
the terminal in jersey city stick your
head in the door and this is about the
first thing you will hear

   it makes me laugh to think of the
way you shoved freight around the yards
and i bossing you at the job

   yes but you never laughed when i
booted you off the caboose for stealing a
ride

   you never did that you were a

 canaler  when i was breaking on the old
hackensack

   when was this  you ask

   along about  or 

  they have all been in the service thirty
forty fifty years and as they say them-
selves they have seen  railroading that
was railroading some of them are
working pretty long hours right now but
they always have a joke on the end of the
tongue only railroading could have
mellowed men that way what follow
are but extracts from a number of pleas-
urable afternoons spent in this excellent
company

 flat-wheels  handicap

   you can say what you like began
j h gordon who was a brakeman on
the erie in  at the age of sixteen
 but  flat-wheel  decker was a better

s


the railroad mans magazine

engineer than jack mooney of course
mooney used to make the records but
how did he do it because he was one of
those fellows who could always get his
repairs done while poor old flat-wheel
never got anything and went out with a
crippled engine half the time i have
braked behind him and i dont ask for a
better man

   but it made him sore when jack
mooney had to help him over the grades
you remember they each took a freight
out of jersey city at the same time every
night  flat-wheel  in the lead even-
other night wed get stuck on account of
lack of repairs and jack would boost us
over the hills

   well if we didnt like it jack did
he got to bragging about it until we
were good and tired and then we took
the tail-lights out of the caboose so he
couldnt see us hed have to be cautious
and that gave us time to get away again
but sooner or later on the run hed gen-
erally hook on behind one night just
as we were starting mooney called out
of his cab

    well i suppose ill be shoving you
half-way over the division to-night

  will you though called out
 flat-wheel

   wrhen jack comedy on the rear end
passed him he called it out again

    well see to that answered com-
edy twisting his face hi a way that showed
he had the right name

   everything went smooth for a while

 flat-wheel  coaxing along his old swal-
low-tail and we had a good lead at ster-
ling junction so we whooped her up
past grevcourt and were going over the
top of chester before we could see mooney
coming down oxford but when we struck
winterbankers crossing the old engine
began to die and jack was gaining on us

comedy takes a hand

  hes got us   i called out to comedy
  not yit comedy answered starting
for the back of the train no red-
headed irishman will put his nose agin
this caboose to-night

   and with that he leaned over the
tail-end with an oil-can and greased the
track for about a mile we werent there
to hear mooneys profanity but the next

day he and comedy settled the matter
after the way of all good irishmen and
both of them carried black eyes for a
couple of weeks

   in those days went on j b hon-
nell who began braking in  but has
had a passenger-train since   the only
way you could tell where the fellow
ahead had hid himself was by keeping
him in sight and if he ever got away
from you you never could tell what curve
lie was lurking behind until vou were
pegging along close up to him again
and there was nothing slow about us
either

   there werexome wild and reckless
engineers too and every one regarded the
next one as his enemy and legitimate as
a target but the worst of the lot was
dick davis he would start out over the
division as if he were the only one on it
and any one who was in his road had to
get a move on and duck for cover

  he didnt know anything about brakes
and wouldnt learn his idea of stop-
ping a train was to reverse and knock the
daylights out of everybody on the train

   you can imagine how comfortable it
was to make a jump from one of those
old one-truck jimmies they used to haul
coal in and hope to land on the car ahead
when you never knew when the whole
train was going to take up about ninety
feet of slack slippery nights you never
could tell when you were going to be shot
from one end of the car to the other i
used to brake behind him and i know
what an unleashed demon he was

   youve heard the story of the car
that jumped the track and was never
missed well that was some of daviss
work he reversed on the grade broke
one of the couplings and when the rest
of the train bumped in behind it knocked
a jimmy right off the track into- the
ditch and jammed so hard into the car
ahead that the train ran away down go-
shen grade and they never missed the car
until they struck the next hill

   he liked to have a slow engineer
alhead of him and keep the caboose
scared to death one night it was like
that and there was some one hanging his
head out of the caboose in front all the
time they had a cautious engineer and
when he came to the grade before you
reach augusta bridge he took it easy
with the veterans of the erie



   now that was one of daviss fa-
vorite places to make-time and it didnt
make any difference to him because there
was somebody on the rails he threw
her wide open and leaned out to see what
the other fellows would do when they
climbed out in a hurry and began to
scamper over the top of the train he
laughed so he could hardly reverse her

   it was all so quick the other brake-
man and i hardly had time to get to

   we used to skip along those days
broke in t f clay who has been with
the erie since   one time there was
a fog at hackensack and we were on the
siding east bound one west-bound pas-
senger had just come into the station
when along came another and plugged
her in the rear and before any one had
time to climb down a third scooted up
behind and plugged the second it took
all day to clean up the mess

he leaned over the tail-end with an oil-can and greased the

track for about a mile

work and only had a couple of brakes
set when the shock came luckily we
each had a hold on a brake at the time
but there wasnt any need for us to go
farther the train stopped so quick da-
vis climbed down in a jiffy and walked
back along the train catching sight of
the two brakes i had set he growled

    now how could i make time with
every brake set on the train 

   but speaking about engineers went
on honnell  frank abbott was the
wicked one and he had a fireman jack
hayes who was a match for him most
of the time they were on bad terms and
wouldnt speak for days and then they
would make up and were thicker than
thieves

  once when they were on speaking
terms frank was showing jack a scare-


the railroad mans magazine

card of the game of policy which he was
always playing but just at that moment
jack was raking down the fire and the
draft pulled the card right into the fire-
box jack knew it would break franks
heart to lose that card o he leaned for-
ward quick sticking his head right into
the fire-box and jerked it out before it
was even singed

   it was pretty hot inside yet and jack
wouldnt have done it for money but
there was that feeling between than
they would do anything for each other
but nothing for anybody else

man who owned the track

   there was a track-walker along in
the seventies whose name ive forgotten
who bothered frank more than anything
on the run he knew it too and took de-
light in it his game was to see how
near he could let a train come without
being hit

   one day we ran across him three
times the first time he stayed on the
track until we had slowed down almost
to a stop and encouraged by that the
next time he kept on ahead until we had
stopped completely

   the third time i remember well
was about half-way between statesville
and haunted house frank gave him
plenty of warning but did ntt slow up
and he kept going right down the middle
of the track

    youll move this time if i have to
do it for you abbott said throwing his
throttle wide oper and shutting his eyes
i saw what was up and i kept my eyes
wide open expecting to see that track-
walker lifted over into the next county
but he saw what was going on too and
you ought to have seen him jump he
didnt do it any too quick either then
he had the nerve to get up and shake his
fist at us

   he wasnt like paddy clinton said
clay  seventy-five years old and the
spriest track-walker you ever saw com-
ing down from manette to manette junc-
tion one day we could see him ahead
driving a spike with his back toward us
he had plenty of warning so we didnt
slow up expecting that he would move
out of the way

 but lie didnt hear and by the time

we could pull up we were right on top
of him we hit him on the slant and
down he went off the embankment into
the bog a fall of ten feet or more we
expected to find him dead but he jumped
up quick as he was hit and waved his hat
all right go ahead   

frank abbotts raspberries

   before i forget about it began
honnell again  i want to tell you about
frank abbott and the raspberries you
all remember jim turners eating-house
where we used to stop the immigrant-
trains and the good thing turner made
out of them

   abbott used to pass there about din-
ner-time with the freight and turner fed
the crew at a fixed price we ate what-
ever there was on the table and the bill
was always the same until one day there
were some raspberries they were good
so we ate all we wanted  and when it
came to pay those raspberries were ex-
tra

  we were all a little sore about it
but frank couldnt let up for days he
kept making remarks about the price of
raspberries

   then he was put on an immigrant-
train and everything went along 
schedule until they were getting up to-
ward turners somehow things began
to go wrong then and by the time they
got to the eating-place it was just time
to pull out and  chance for the immi-
grants to go in

   turner was one of those fellows who
was always outside seeing how things
were coming on and when he learned
they were going to pull right out he ran
forward and said to abbott  whats the-
matter with your engine the other fel-
lows always make it on time

    i dunno answered abbott grin-
ning  unless maybe shes got raspber-
ries in her smoke-stack

   now when jack hayes got mad he
was just the other way hed stick his
nose a mile in the air and talked to no-
body he had a few hundred dollars in
a savings bank up the line and one day
it struck him hed take it out when he
went around they were a little shy of
cash and told him hed have to give
them a few days notice
with the veterans of the erie



    you wont give me my money-is
that the way of it   he asked

    no thats not it the paying-teller
tried to explain

    well thats the way it looks to me
said jack  but if you dont want to
give me my money you can keep it

    i did but i gave it to them they
didnt seem to have any and i had plen-
ty so i just gave it to them 

  the room where they were talking was
once the barroom of a saloon which was
encouraged many years ago by the erie
in the hope that a rival across the street

 with that he walked out of the bank and
 he never went back again two or three
 years afterward the bank broke and some
 one of the boys were bemoaning their
 loss one of them said to jack

a gift to the poor

  you lost some money in it too
didnt you jack 

   i did not

  i thought you had some there

would sell out at a reasonable figure and
allow the terminal to be widened

  instead of driving him out of business
the competition on the corner boomed
the neighborhood the erie gave in
then but not until the other fellow had
thrived so that he was able to rebuild
recently he has rehabilitated his place
once more but long ago all idea of deal-
ing with him was given up

  the clubroom has been in use a long
time now the wide old desks are bat-

you ought to have seen him jump

  when these men were young they had

rough railroading they speak of so light-

matter is touched on their faces all be-
come grave

   i could tell plenty of stories of that
kind one of them said  but they would

deckers wonderful coolness

some of these cases however stand
out so vividly that they are repeated now
and then one of these relates to  co 
with the veterans of the erie



decker a brakeman of the seventies and
it was told by william mcpeek a veteran
of forty years who saw him when he was
smashed

  his coolness was what struck me
said mcpeek  he had placed his fin-
gers over the end of a draw-head to make
a coupling and when the two draw-heads
came together they struck all four of his
fingers and mashed them into ribbons

  he looked at his hand saw what was
the matter and without a moments hesi-
tation bit his fingers off it must have
hurt him a good deal then and after-
ward but he never let on and took the
train in and wouldnt stop for assist-
ance

  sudden death was no rare occurrence
and it took an extraordinary case to keep
the memory of it green but the fate of
dallas washer has never been forgotten

  if there was ever a man who had a
presentiment it was dallas said hon-
nell who had been a brakeman with him
 he knew something was going to hap-
pen and he talked about it all night so
that we realized his time had probably
come when he failed to return from the
front end of the train to the caboose 

gloom was prophetic

   it seemed as if things were bound to
go wrong that night first the pusher
tried to climb into the caboose then the
train broke in two and finally it ran
away down the grade to middletown it
wasnt dallass run and he was at home
in brooklyn half sick when they sent
word to him to take it his wife begged
him to stay and send back word that he
was not fit but he went anyhow

   before we started he told me he was
not feeling right about the run that night
and every time something happened he
said  i knew thered be trouble to-
night but theres worse than this com-
ing i can feel it in my bones i dont
know what it is but i am afraid it is
going to be pretty bad

   he kept talking about it so much
that i hated to let him go ahead alone
and the last time i saw him i wondered
if he might not be right on a mixed
train of coal dumps and freights it was
common enough for a man to fall off
trying to catch a side ladder and that

must have been what happened to dal-
las in the jump he must have missed
his hold and fallen down on the rail
he was a sight after twenty cars had
passed over him

  mcpeek himself holds the record for
holding up cars in a wreck eighteen
piled one on top of the other but he is
still here to tell the tale

   it was on the goshen grade he be-
gan  and at the moment i was climb-
ing over an empty dump when we
struck the whole train was shot straight
over the embankment with me in the
coal-dump in the lead  grabbed for
the rod and did trapeze acts all the way
down until we hit the bottom when i
found myself underneath without any
way of getting out

   for a moment i was glad enough
as i could hear the others come down on
top and i thought i counted a hundred
when they took them off there were only
eighteen but in the meanwhile i did a
lot of figuring on how long it would
take to pick two freight-trains off my
back

   i was eleven hours under that dump
and by and by i could hear levi cooper
the wrecking boss giving orders pretty
soon he said  turn over that one
maybe hes under there they gave a
pry up came the dump and i scuttled
out like a rabbit

    there he goes cried cooper
 worth a hundred dead men yet 

mcpeeks great marathon

  this was not the only acrobatic per-
formance mcpeek ever figured in one day
he was standing on the last car switch-
ing and gave the signal to shake her up
the order was executed rather more sud-
denly than he expected and the car was
jerked right out from under his feet he
completed one back flip and was in the
middle of the next when he struck the
ground for a minute he did not know
whether he was on the track or not but
half-stunned he could hear the cars pass-
ing and knew that he had landed along-
side

  but the occasion for which he is noted
was when he dumped a train-load of hogs
into passaic draw there used to be a
pretty heavy grade down to the passaic


the railroad mans magazine

and the old drawbridge was lower than
the bridge now in use

  signals were scarce along the road but
as this was considered a dangerous place
a disk had been erected there it as so
near the bridge however that it served
no purpose when a heavy train was on
the grade and such a train mcpeek was
braking on

  just beyond the signal and only a
few feet short of the bridge said mc-
peek  there was a quince-tree that had
grown low and wide on top in quince
season signal or no signal we always
stopped there and took a few that is
why harriot the engineer remembered it

   by the time he saw the signal there
was no stopping the train from jumping
into tlhe open draw but he waited until
he was abreast the quince-bush before he
let go the fireman having nothing but
a steep embankment to light on landed
on his feet breaking both legs  but har-
riot escaped without a scratch

   i was forward brakeman and at the
time  was standing on the first car be-
hind the engine not knowing anything
about the trouble until  saw harriot
jump it was too late for me to jump
chen so i started back over the tops of
the cars i made the second before the
first struck the bridge but as i jumped
from the second to the third i could feel
it rising under me as it toppled

   the train was going faster than i
was and by the time i was at die end of
the third car i had to jump quick not
to go over too there seemed to be no
stopping the train and it looked as if the
whole thing would go in i was the only
one left on it except the hogs and they
were squealing all through the train ma-
king more noise than the falling cars

running it close

   the fourth car i took on the wing
and the fifth was already well over the
edge when i leaped and caught the brake
of the sixth before i could get a start
again to make up for the precious second
i had lost regaining my balance i was
running up-hill but the car for some
reason hung for just a moment and i
made the seventh

   by this time i was running right
over the end of the draw and it seemed

like one of those races in a nightmare
where you run your legs off but cant get
away from one spot

   when the seventh went over the edge
i was getting behind in the race and
was about six feet over the water but the
car seemed to be going straight ahead as
if there were track under it although it
was only riding out on another car that
was piled up on end and over she went
just as  jumped to the eighth

   i could see harriot in his quince-
bush lying there as if he were in a ham-
mock and i wondered what kind of a
place i was going to land in i made
the ninth before the eighth broke away
 had a start then but i noticed tney
were still going over behind me but
when i reached the caboose i saw that
the train had stopped the eighth had
been the last one over

   when the cars smashed they broke
open scattering hogs over the whole sur-
face of the passaic you can go down
to some of those farms now and see the
descendants of that train-load of hogs

king hates a blizzard

  another active old-timer who has a
long record behind him is dudley king
he was braking as early as  and
has been a conductor since s he
is now in charge of a train between port
jervis and jersey city he is a hale and
hearty old man but he had no use for cold
weather as he was frost-bitten in the fa-
mous blizzard in march  the part
lie played was heroic but he does not
dwell on it with any satisfaction

  the blizzard came late following a
period of warm weather and one of the
few passengers he took out of new york
in the midst of it was a young girl from
up the country who had on only spring
clothes half-way between two towns
away from all help they were stalled
the heat gave out and there was nothing
to eat except a lunch that king had
brought along

  this he divided among the passengers
and settled down to wait until they were
dug out that was nineteen hours later
and meanwhile it was growing colder and
colder king offered the girl his over-
coat but she refused and continued to re-
fuse until she was blue with cold and then
with the veterans of the erie	

 king asserted his authority and made
 her put it on even then she made him
 promise he would ask her for it if he
 had to go out

    as soon as she laid down in that
 warm coat king said when asked for
 the story  she fell fast asleep i kept

   another passenger spoke up then and
said

    let me lend you what you need mr
bryan how far are you going 

   mr bryan told him and he produced
a silver dollar king took it looked at
bryan then at the other passenger and
back to bryan

whats it worth he
asked

 one dollar replied mr
bryan

 but how do i know it
wont change its value said
king  do you guarantee it
as a sixteen-to-one dollar
king must be a republican
because he could not help rub-
bing it in

 moving around trying to keep warm but
 the thermometer was getting down pret-
 ty low and i thought i would freeze to
 death but i would not have asked for
 that coat if my fingers had dropped off

     when they dug us out the next after-
 noon they had to cut off my boots and
 i was nearly dead from exposure the
 girl slept through it all but when she
 woke up she had a frightful cough from
 having got so cold before she would take
 the coat six months later she died of
 quick consumption

   that is a story king does not care
 much to tell but he feels differently
 about the time he had w j bryan for a
 passenger it was between presidential
 campaigns and mr bryan was lecturing
 the chautauqua towns he boarded the
 train at a way-station and king coming
 through the train stopped to collect his
 ticket mr bryan fumbled through his
 pockets looked in his grip fumbled some
 more and then said smiling

     youve got me this time i have no
 ticket and i dont seem to have any
 money

the fourth
i took on the
wing

   do you know where you lost your
money mr bryan he asked

    i hid it mr bryan replied

    hid it   questioned king

    yes-where it would be safe

    oh thats so said king as if a
great light had broken in on him  i
forgot you were among democrats
werent you

   a good many of the stories they tell
bear on the jimmies they were a
source of severe trial and were danger-
ous besides

    one nice cold november bright and


the railroad mans magazine

early i was trying to put the brake on
one gordon said li the brakes were
on the side and you pushed them down
with your foot sometimes they went
easy and other times hard this one
was easy and i jammed her a little so
she missed the catch and flew right up in
my stomach

goble gets facetious

   just at that moment we were passing
a pond that had new ice on it when i
struck it i was trying to do the cross-
country dive and i didnt know where
i was or where  came from some one
called to me from the top of the train
 what you doing down there  

    taking a swim of course i an-
swered   fine weather for it dont vou
think

   a green brakeman fell off a jimmy
one time and rolled down the embank-
ment honnell related  and morris
goble who was a good brakeman if he
was a wild indian called out to him

    hurry and get up or youll miss
the train

   and its many the kid ive jumped
off and whaled continued honnell
 thinking they had struck me but it was
only the brake of a jimmy flying up
among the veterans is a huge loosely
built man john tyrrell now a conduct-
or but who like the rest went through
an apprenticeship they were telling a
story of his prowess

   fie could lift a hogshead of molasses
and carry it away some one was saving
 isnt that right john 

   no mon born of woman ever did
thot he replied  it weighs fifteen
hundred pounds but i have carried a
barrel and thot weighs seven hundred
and fifty pounds thot was when i was
young and a fool

  jimmie obrien is another irishman
and one of the few nowadays whom you
see smoking a clay pipe he has not
been so long in the service as the others
as he was inherited from the hackensack
when that was taken over by the erie
but he is regarded as one of the veterans
just the same he began as a brakeman
and it seemed to him he had to wait a
long time before he was made a con-
ductor and even then he saw others put

in ahead of him on the passenger-runs
so he went to the president of the hack-
ensack and complained

   and why dont ye give me a passen-
ger  he asked

   well demurred the president
 you see its a matter of nationality
youre not an american

  jim was deeply hurt at this  me not
an american   he said

   youve not been aaturalized nave
you  

   is it to be naturalized to vote

   yes

   well thin im eligible i vote all
right an to show ye how good an
american i am every election day i vote
twice once on each end of the run

  he got his passenger

  there are two brothers m f and
george h conklin who went to work
on the erie as boys in war-time the
former avas a train-bov and made his
first money selling fruit to the confeder-
ate prisoners who were being sent north
to mast hope

   they were a care-free lot he says
of them  and hardly seemed like men
who were going to prison i dont know
where they got their money from it was
supposed to be so scarce-in the south but
they always had some to spend

a good citizen

  most of these years conklin has been
a baggageman on a train between jersey
city and suffern new york and for a
long time his brother george was engi-
neer on the same train he is the elder
and has been running trains now for for-
ty-four years

  i when i was a train-boy said m
f  i saw a man fall off a platform and
have his leg cut off under the wheel and
just as he went down a bottle of whisky
rolled out of his pocket that was a les-
son in temperance i have never forgotten
and i have never touched a drop

  many of the old-timers are gone now
and none is more regretted than e o

as the others put it  went through the

modern station rules

by george primrose

the following rules and regulations should be strictly-
adhered to by all concerned

      this station is a public playground and loafing quarters for all who
      have been ejected from elsewhere

      the waiting-room should never be occupied by trainmen and loafers
      if possible for them to crowd into the ticket-office

           the door to the ticket-office is only for looks and is not intended to keep
       people from entering the office if the agent should make a mistake and
       lock it the person who feels his presence inside indispensable should kick it
       down if he cannot get in quick enough by waiting for same to be unlocked

          the ticket-office is the reception-room for engineers conductors brake-
      men firemen baggagemen and in fact every one that is on the pay-roll the
      oftener they come in and with muddy shoes the more welcome they are

          when the operator is copying a message or train order it is the duty of
      every one that can read to hover around him and read as fast as he writes
      and if possible read in advance if he is taking a private message read aloud
      while he copies it so that any one within a radius of a hundred yards of the
      depot can hear

          if there are not chairs enough in the office after the agent and office
      force give up theirs sit  the telegraph table and put your feet on anything
      that comes handy lean over on the desk in the way of some one that is
      busy and insist  telling all the old stale yarns we heard when we were boys

          freight conductors should never check up their trains where there is
      plenty of room but should take up the last available space in the ticket-office
      for their work and should always be attended by at least two or more of their
      brakemen	

          when entering the ticket-office always fill your mouth with a piece of
      tobacco the size of a hens egg if the cuspidor is not in sight spit at the
      coal-hod but under  circumstances spit in it this rule applies to the stove

           if you have any bundles to leave or any errands to run dont fail to call
       on the agent he is a public servant and is always ready to wait on you

          engineers when running for a hill past station should always open
      cylinder-cocks so as to blow station fullof cinders and soil the windows
      as much as possible this should be adhered to strictly regardless of num-
      ber of trips past station

any article around the station that is not nailed down should be carried off

          any violation of the above rules should be promptly reported to the
      undersigned	an ldtime acent 


bill gets double-headed

            by f h richardson

            it might not have happened if sue
            hadnt sent him her photograph

t are you looking
 glum about
ked the engineer
hen he saw bills
d n g face and
noted how bill
slammed the shovel and cracked each
lump of coal as if he were trying to wipe
some mortal enemy off the map

   mother of the everlasting smoke-
stacks cant a feller have a grouch
without you buttin in sposin i am
mad shes carryin a white feather
aint she even if you are workin that
durnd injector overtime an blowin
steam through th whistle every chance
you get i dont see where youve got
any shout cornin 

   im not kicking i just wondered
what could have happened to ruffle the
temper of so good-natured a chap as
you and the engineer winked his off eye
solemnly at a mile-board as it flew past

   well said the fireman considerably
mollified at this tribute  theys some
people in this wofld that ought t have
their supply of air shut off real quick
theyre too durnd ornery t do any-
thing but run a dog-pound-an id feel
sorry for th dogs if they was even on
that job

  bill put in a fire swept off the deck
and after squirting some black oil on the
palms of his new gloves and rubbing it
in continued

   y see i went up t th roundhouse
yesterday t clean out my seat-box an
do a few other stunts i had laid out for
quite a spell theys a lot of smart alec
tallow-pots mostly on th extra list
loafin round there an seein as they
aint got no particular business of their

	r r	

own theyre mos generally ready t tend
to everybody elses

   well i was working away tendin
strictly to my own business when that
little sawed-off runt fatty burns wad-
dles over an climbs up in th cab an
starts chinnin about what hard luck hes
had an wont i lend him a couple of
plunks till pay-day it takes me just
two-fifths of a second t put th skids
under him and get it worked through
that boiler-plate skull of his that im no
banker an he goes off grumblin just
as jim watson oozed himself through
th gangway an planked his loose-con-
nected frame up on your seat-box

   you know th gangle-shanked coal-
heaver he got his first job firin about
three months ago an now he puts in
all his spare time tellin th rest of us
things we learned an forgot before he
knew an engine from a stack of hav-

   it seems he had just got wise t
usin oxalic acid for scourin brass an
of course he had t explain th whole
business t me why durn his lantern-
jawed mug i knew all that while he
was still milkin th goats down on
grandpas farm but of course i let him
discourse until he run down

   thats th only way with his kind
jus let em run till they run down an
then make a getaway while theyre re-
windin

   well purty soon lie told everything
he knew and then told a few yards of
what he didnt know then somebody
called him an he tore himself away
before all th varnish was wore off th cab
by th continuous flow of words

   an then th trouble train come in
th roundhouse foreman has a big bull-


the railroad mans magazine

dog though what in th name of ever-
lastin valve-stems he wants of th ornery-
lookin freak is a sight more than i
know it camps in th roundhouse sun-
days week-days an legal holidays

   he wont be there much longer for
im goin t bounce a ten-pound lump
of cast iron on his measly skull th first
good chance i get

  what did the dog do to you bill

   do to me  said the fireman with
a snort  youd better ask what lie didnt
do it wont take so long t tell

   id got th seat-box cleaned out an
was standin in th gangway admirin a
photograph of sue she give me th last
time i was over an it slipped out of
my hand th floor of that engine hotel
aint none too clean an not wantin t
get th picture dirty i made a quick dive
for it an lost my equaliber-broom or
whatever th high-brows call it 

   equilibrium you mean bill com-
mented the engineer

   yas i reckon thats it anyway i
got from th engine t th floor some more
sudden than graceful th picture lit on
a nice greasy piece of waste an my hoof
lit on th picture an then th towerman
jerked up th bad-luck semaphore with
a bang

   y see that fool roundhouse fore-
man has got a lot of water-pipes runnin
around an theres a little pipe with a
valve stickin out from a post beside
every stall for th wipers t connect a
hose t wash th mud off th drivers an
trucks

   theyre connected with th city
water-mains an judgin by results they
must carry about four hundred an seven-
ty-eight pounds pressure

   well when i lit on th floor i hit
one of th durnd things an broke it off
th stream hit me square on th west ear

   say ill bet i did six pinwheels be-
fore i touched th floor when i did
light it was on top of th roundhouse
foreman who happened t be pettin his
bulldog

   i reckon th mutt thought i was an
italian blackhand tryin t work his boss
into a trunk mystery

   i lit on all fours leakin water all
over an that infernal beast probably
thinkin i needed help coupled onto me
behind say was you ever double-headed

by a bulldog  and bill paused anxious-
ly for a reply

  no i cant say i ever was replied
the engineer

   well all i can say is dont go
huntin for th experience th dog
coupled on an give th signal t start
an you bet i opened er up real quick
its a mighty searchin feelin t have a
full-sized dog industriously tryin t bite
a pound of meat off your frame 

   did it hurt  asked the manipulator
of levers

  his minion looked at him solemnly for
a moment put in a fire and pulled the
bell-rope for a crossing before replying

   did it hurt well between the
shower-bath an th jaws of that dog i
guessi was plum loco i started runnin
in th direction i happened t be headed
with th pup trailin along behind an
reachin fer a bigger bite th foreman
jumped up an took after us an you bet
they was some commotion

   i heard one feller that saw th pro-
ceeding yell  go it bill youre gainin
on him which were a lie how can a
feller gain on a dog that is fastened to
him with a grip like a janney coupler

   right ahead of me was a window
an i made a dive for it not stoppin t
consider th fact that there was a sash
an about twenty-nine lights of glass
in it

   i hit th thing square in th middle
an it sounded like a glass factory was
bein blowed up with gunpowder ill
take my solemn oath it rained glass an
splinters of wrood aroun there for ten
minutes th air was so full of th stuff
that some of it had t wait fer what was
below t get out of th way before it
could fall

  just as we went through th win-
dow th roundhouse foreman caught up
with th procession an grabbed th mutt
by th tail his grip didnt hold but ill
bet a two-ton coal-ticket agin a square
meal that th south end of that pups
backbone will be lame for quite a spell

    i lit outside th winder with th sash
aroun my neck an th pup atween my
legs like i was ridin him

   they was a pile of soot jus out-
side th window-oh they wasnt a tiling
lackin t make th occasion a howlin
success
firing a work of brain



   i dont know where th cussed stuff
come from but it was th real article
like you get out of old stovepipes an
it was about three feet deep

   we landed square in th middle of
it you know how that kind of stuff
flies well they was a feller up-town
told me last night he thought a volcano
busted out when he saw it it was no
volcano but just me an that pup tryin
to scrub that pile of soot off th map

   it was no bloomin failure either
when we got through that stuff was dis-
tributed over half a mile of territory

   well by n by some wipers an th
foreman choked th mutt loose

   them galvanized apes o wipers just
looked at me an laughed like th whole
thing was funny some people have

crazy ideas of whats amusing ill bet

i	used half of lake michigan scrubbin
that soot off me

  you werent dirty were you bill
asked the engineer innocently

   oh no of course i wasnt i was
clean as a hog thats been makin hisself
comfortable in a puddle of black mud
for a couple of hours all i needed was
a little rice - powder on th end of my
nose to be presented t th king of eng-
land

   an what d you think that measley
foreman had th nerve t do jumped
all over me because th pup got scratched
up with th glass goin through th win-
dow  i reckon he thought i ought t a
stopped an wrapped him in cotton bat-
tin before making th getaway 

firing a work of brain

by e a spears

why it is necessary for the tallow-pot of to-day to be mufh more
than a mere coal-pusher in order to
hold his job

e was a sandy-haired mus-
 cular young fireman his
 jaw avas square and his
 forehead high he sat on
 a bench in the roundhouse
 of the new york central
 lines and talked about his calling

    it wasnt many years ago he said
  that a fireman wasnt supposed to have
 much more than bulging biceps and lay-
 ers of muscles across his back when
 you asked for a job they would fire two
 questions at you have you got the
 beef  and  have you got the nerve 

    thats all they wanted to know and

	they considered that enough to make a
 good fireman

    but times have changed five years
 ago i began as a fireman on the dela-
 ware lackawanna and western by that
 time they were holding examinations all
 the boys were expecting promotions and

they were studying up  combustion
steam brakes and locomotive practise

   there were engineers who had been
on the road for years and they knew
mighty little about the theory of the loco-
motive they just knew that certain
things happened when you did certain
other things but they didnt know the
why of it they were just men of the
old times

   and  tell you us fellows who were
studying the theory of the engine would
get these old engineers wild asking them
questions an engineer would most al-
ways give some sort of an answer fled
make a stab at it whether it was right or
wrong for he didnt want to say he didnt
know

   when he was wrong the fireman
would go ahead and tell him where he
was twisted and explain his own engine
to him this often made the engineer


the railroad mans magazine

so hot that he would say it wasnt so
he guessed he knew and no fireman could
tell him anything about an engine after
he had run one for twenty years it was
heaps of fun

   the authorities used to look for men
of courage and muscle to make firemen
but now they want the men who use their
heads it makes all the difference in the
profits of the company whether a man is
just muscle or both muscle and brain

   not only do we get our examinations
but the bosses have a way of coming
around and casually asking you a ques-
tion about combustion about different
grades of coal and their effects in the en-
gine or some other question that dont
seem to make much difference well if
the fireman can answer the questions or
shows an interest in them he is more val-
uable

   let me tell you about a trip i had
when several students made a test of the
engine and our work these students
kept tabs on the steam-pressure the
amount of water in the boiler the notch
at which the engineer had his throttle
and every time  threw in coal and the
amount

   in short they kept track of the
whole business at the end of the run
they had a graphic representation of the
pressure of steam at every minute of the
trip they knew when everything was
done and where it was done

   knowing the grades and the stops
they could tell whether or not a lot of
coal and steam was desirable at such a
place and whether we had too much or
too little

   i was careful not to shovel in too
much coal and to keep the fire just right
but i learned from those students that i
had used in the eighty-mile run just eight
hundred pounds more coal than i needed

   some people think that an engine is
an engine and let it go at that they
think that they are all alike if they are
of the same size but you may take two

engines built on exactly the same de-
signs built by the same locomotive works
so that they do not vary mechanically a
hairs breadth and when you go to use
them you will find them as different in
nature as one woman from another

   you build one kind of a fire in one
engine and shell pop and you build the
same kind of a fire in another of similar
model and shell be so dead you cant
pull a pay-car

   i have built a dozen different kinds
of fires in an engine before i found the
proper one for that particular locomotive

   one engine will need a high fire in
front and a low fire behind while anoth-
er engine will require exactly the oppo-
site and still another will best go with a
level fire

   they can now figure out just how
much coal a fireman should use between
two given points they know how many
miles a certain quality and quantity of
coal will carry

   to grease your engine they give you
so much oil knowing that it will take you
so far but they cant do that with coal
they give you more than enough if any-
thing

   supposing they would say to you

	well you have a dry rail to-day and the
wind isnt against you so many tons
will carry you then suppose you travel
a certain distance and it begins to rain
and the wheels slip every revolution of
the drivers means the exhaust of so much
steam

  if you have sixteen or twenty ex-
hausts of steam which dont carry you
ahead you have got to use more coal to
produce more steam to carry you over the
rail the distance yout should have gone
with the sixteen or twenty exhaustions

   then supposing a high wind should
swing around against you such a wind
sometimes makes as much as a third dif-
ference in the speed you must have the
coal to overcome it and thats why it
isnt measured out like the oil

                 the master mechanic makes the
                 old man believe in his story

synopsis of previous chapters

vincent wilson young and ambitious having risen from the apprentice shop to
mechanical superintendent of the great mainland system has discovered wliat lie
believes to be a leak in the affairs of the company and criticizes to president harvey jones
the action of the board of directors on voting the sum of twenty thousand dollars for
certain purchases wilson visits a former employee of the mainland system doc
ferguson who imparts to him the information that kaintuck a former friend of both
had developed leprosy and been sent to the leper settlement at molokai kaintuck was
betrothed to a beautiful girl meriel planquette whose address wilson is very desirous of
obtaining from  doc  doc  refuses to give this information unless wilson meets his
price which is five thousand dollars

is here in this city-or let us say in new
york you must have her there has
been a defalcation or something money
is missing a trusted employee is involved
in suspicion a girl once poor who
saw the man she loved and whom she
knew loved her to distraction go to a leper
settlement suddenly this girl becomes
rich and lives in affluence her name is
connected with that of the employee un-
der suspicion what could be more natu-
ral  

  to his astonished senses ferguson had
unveiled to wilson the very plot that the
young railroad man was trying to unravel

  how did he come to know this was
he a necromancer-a mind reader who
had let him into the secret or was it
only guesswork

  vincent wilson was so completely dum-
loundecl that he could not find a ready
answer

  finally when he had collected his
senses lie figured out mentally that it
would be best to be as diplomatic as pos-
sible he quickly turned the matter
aside

   pardon me doctor he said  if i
have shown that i have a yellow streak

chapter iii

in the big mans confidence

            ferguson did not
         lose his head fie re-
         mained perfectly cool and
         the more he remained cool
         the more harvey wilson
         became wrought up

  he slowly calmed himself he had
sufficient self-possession not to let temper
get the best of him especially when de-
bating with an older man

   you may call it extortion said the
doctor  but you fellows revel in money
and when you want information from a
poor man you are unwilling to pay for
it i dare say that if you knew the exact
whereabouts of meriel planquette it
would be worth that sum to you come
now  

   i cannot say-now- replied wilson
 it probably would

   you had better take time to think it
over a day or so wont make ifruch dif-
ference went on old ferguson  and
the longer you think it over the sooner
you will agree with me

   granted he continued  that meriel


the railroad mans magazine

   go and think it over said the doc-
tor  you will always find me here
whenever you want to talk it over

  he smiled a cynical knowing smile
he seemed to want to assure vincent
wilson that he was in the right and that
if harvey knew on which side his bread
was buttered he would do his thinking
pretty soon

  vincent left the doctors office and
strolled back to the companys office

  it seemed ages until half-past three
oclock when he was to keep his appoint-
ment with harvey jones

  so eager was he to be on time that he
entered the outer office just as the big
clock was striking the quarter hour

  fifteen minutes to wait it seemed
an eternity

   is president jones in he asked a
clerk

  yes do you wish to see him
wilson glanced at the clock only a
few minutes had elapsed since it struck
he was ahead of time but maybe it
would be good policy to be announced
right away

  president jones was a prompt man-
prompt in all things and it might so hap-
pen that he would appreciate wilson be-
ing able to keep an appointment ahead of
time

   tell linn mr vincent wilson he
said to the clerk

  the clerk knocked on the private door
of the great mans private office and en-
tered

  the president was the first to speak

   that was a tough accusation you
made to me to-day he said  and you
are here ahead of time to report it

   i came early because the thing is on
my mind answered the younger man
 i dont know if  am right-i may be
mistaken-but i have been putting two
and two together for some time now and
in every case they make four

   get down to business wilson im
a busy man

   i told you that there is a leak some-
where in this office money has been ap-
propriated for improvements that have
never been made

   is that a direct charge 

   yes

   do you know the guilty party

   i do not but ill find him in time

   on what specific information or evi-
dence do you base your belief 

   on what has come to my notice we
have been spending more than we should
for certain things i told you this morn-
ing that i had been getting figures

  the directness of the young mans
words made a deep impression on presi-
dent jones

   vincent he said at length if i
didnt know you i should say that you
were either a fool or a mischief-maker
but i can pretty nearly tell when a man
is speaking sincerely

   its not for me to put my nose in
where it would get pinched said wil-
son

   dishonest men creep into big corpo-
rations-just as they creep into other con-
cerns the president went on  some of
them operate pretty cleverly-so cleverly
indeed that it is often impossible to find
them out and so they work on unmolested
for years

   it is hard to think that any man in
whom you have placed your trust should
rob you under your very eyes

   thats what is going on here re-
plied the younger man

  are you capable of finding out
asked jones

   i think i am i only need time and
not a very long time at that

   do you need the aid of a detective 
 not now what i need now is
money

  how much askd the president
without hesitation

   i cannot say yet there is a woman
who must be found

   always the woman mused the older
man

   yes replied the younger  if i can
locate her  will locate my man

   do you know anything about her
 i understand that her name is meriel
planquette she is living in great style
either in this city or in new york my
theory is this she is blackmailing this
man-this particular man who is an offi-
cer in your company she used to be a
poor girl in this town she is very
pretty and was once in love with a fel-
low they called kaintuck

  he had to be sent to the leper settle-
ment at molokai in honolulu she was
supposed to follow him there but when
president of the line



looking around for the necessary money

lo	get transportation she fell in with tl-is
official

   and what became of kain-what did
you call him  

   kaintuck said vincent wilson
 why she merely shook him-as they
say money turned her head

  president jones was getting interested
the young mans story certainly had the
earmarks of plausibility but it was the
unflinchingly plain and blunt manner in
which he told it that made his superior
officer place absolute confidence in him

  harvey jones paced up and down his
office he looked out of the window he
returned to his desk looked at wilson
and walked back again to the window
where he beat on the pane with his fin-
gers

  could it be possible that one of the
men in his great organization-an organi-
zation of which he was so proud and
which he had taken so much trouble to
build up-should be robbing him 

  it was a blow even to think of it
great scott here in his own company
he was almost ready to rush into the
outer office and ask the man to step forth
so sudden was the touch of anger that
rushed into his brain

  harvey jones seldom lost control of
himself he seldom said or did things
for which he was sorry the diplomat-
ist is born all the schooling in the
world will not make him-but schooling
will perfect him jones was not going to
spoil any part of wilsons chance to trap
the culprit-and he was convinced now
that there was something wrong some-
where

  he turned to wilson who had sat
watching him closely

   wilson he said  i want to ask you
one question

    ill answer it if i can mr jones
tell me have you any idea who this
man is have you any suspicion

    not the slightest

   but you are sure of this girl-what
did you say her name is 

   meriel planquette

  president jones made a note of the
name on a pad on his desk

   can you locate her

   i think i can there is an old man
in the neighborhood - an old doctor -

who knows her whereabouts i am sure
but he will not divulge unless he is well

paid

   have you seen him 

  vincent wilson related his visit to
 doc  ferguson in every detail

   i listened to his yarn he said in
closing the incident  and then asked his
price to tell me meriel planquettes
whereabouts he demanded five thou-
sand dollars

   preposterous  shouted the pres-
ident

   i told him so answered wilson
 and i meant it

    do you think that he is in league with
her

  no my impression is this he evi-
dently saw that i was badly in need of
the information and he saw a chance to
make money  think that if he is offered
five hundred dollars cash he will not
hesitate to tell all he knows about her
 try him said president jones  we
must do what we can to get to the bottom
of this

chapter iv

the market price

hp urning again to his desk the pres-
ident of- the mainland system
touched a button in an instant a tall
slender youth entered

 tell mr lowery i want to see him
the youth nodded and left the room
and it was only a moment before mr
lowery one of the assistant cashiers en-
tered

   bring me five hu idred dollars in
hundred-dollar bills said president
jones  and have it charged to my ac-
count

   lowery departed to carry out the order
 you have never told me harvey
where you got your information that led
to this-this charge of yours i can only
call it a charge just now for it is aimed
against some one in the company

  it dawned upon me when i was
checking up one of my bills for equip-
ment for our norfolk division

   in what way how 

   it simply struck me that the price
charged for certain items was a great deal
more than the regular market price that


the railroad mans magazine

was one instance again i noticed one
account that called for a great deal more
of a particular item than we needed

   my suspicions were aroused i
looked deeper into the matter i am con-
vinced that i am not mistaken if you
want further details you may have them
at any time-now if you say so

   not now replied the president
 my time is occupied for the rest of the
afternoon later we will talk it over at
length

  he handed vincent wilson the money
the young man tucked it away in his
wallet then started to go

  president jones took his hand and
pressed it warmly

   you have mv best wishes my boy if
you prove your case i am your best
friend-and theres a future here for you
that will mean something

chapter v
the deal in denver

tt was evening in a richly furnished
apartment on one of those highways
in new york city where those who
have money live in all the splendor of
metropolitan luxury

  meriel planquette sat before her mir-
ror and pinned a red rose in her dark
hair it reposed against the black coif-
fure tenderly and becomingly her face
was illumined with a smile of satisfac-
tion she reveled in the undisputed evi-
dence of her own beauty

   he told me i looked like cleopatra
she said to herself  cleopatra was
beautiful-so beautiful-so ingeniously
beautiful he told me also that i
looked like juno but i dont like
junos face-so fluffy and her hair-
not even respectable that made me
think that he wanted to flatter me if
he had only been content with cleo-
patra

  meriel floated into a reverie wherein a
number of men danced gayly before her
but wherein one man - john toylmore
-never entered to her john toyl-
more had been every inch a bore-but he
had money when she married him

  her married life had been short john
toylmore was a well-to-do railroad man
when she met him-the new york rep-

resentative of the mainland system she
considered it a good match for he had a
position that brought a salary that gave
her social position

  it was toylmore who had won her
from kaintuck-who had proposed when
lie had fully blinded her eyes to her
former sweetheart in the leper settlement
and had married her giving her luxury
and position

  but their married life was destined to
be for less than a year toylmore was
killed while touring in his own automo-
bile

  his beautiful widow mourned but
very little soon after he was laid away
she began to look at life through pleasant
glasses

  she was not going to spoil her pretty
face with weeping she was not going
to become a victim to moods of mourn-
ing  no not she

  when toylmore took her away from
kaintuck hadnt he destroyed forever all
her sense of sentiment hadnt he
shown her that money was more than
love what was there to be gained by
living in poverty and gloom when one
could live in riches and sunshine

  these were the questions she asked her-
self and to each of which she answered
 what 

  pretty and rich and a widow men
would soon be paying her attention-and
they did

  they told her she was wonderful-
beautiful they extolled her charms
and her manner

  but she felt that their words were false
what they wanted was her money-not
herself

  all save one jimmie winters had
made love in the maddened pathos of real
earnestness but he is so young thought
mrs toylmore he can hardly be a
man and yet he boasted of his twenty-
two summers as one avho has defeated
death in old age boasts of longevity his
was a persistent wooing too impas-
sioned fiery almost desperate and full
of meaning had it been the wooing of
any other man it would have wearied her
but there was an inexpressible charm to
jimmie winters

  it was so unlike bertrand clivers-
the short stout blustering broker to
whom sentiment too was as the dead sea
president of the line



fruit whose prosaic nature never rose be-
yond a cold  good evening meriel
when he arrived and a colder  good
night meriel when he went away

  and to clivers meriel was no more
than the victims clothes to a brigand
it was her gold that he wanted it was
the fortune that toylvnore had left-
the same fortune that he had once tried
to deftly lure from the dead railroad
man by a  little deal in denver

  clivers went home one night after
having asked the pretty widow for the
eighth time if she would be his wife
with her customary coyness she had an-
swered no 

  as he tumbled into bed that night he
felt that he could almost commit mur-
der for her money the widows for-
tune would come in so handy with it
he could buy in with brockley the bro-
ker in the oil deal - and wall street
would call him a napoleon

  meriel brushed into the spacious draw-
ing-room and threw herself into a big
blue armchair in front of the tempting
fire she loved that room with its in-
dian tapestries its massive furniture and
its deep red walls

  it was jimmies night to call

  she settled in the chair and opened her
book she had hardly read ten lines
when the door-bell announced that jim-
mie had arrived the stiff butlers
 mr winters maam brought meriel
to her feet and she greeted the young
man with all the fulsomeness of her
heart jimmie advanced enraptured
and took the-hand held out to him

   shall i call you cleopatra to-night
he said  or shall i christen you the
medea

   no jimmie i like cleopatra best
she was a reality and the medea was
only one of those sun-myths cleopatra
-she had all the men at her feet and
my friends do say-that i am a cleo-
patra

   i like you to-night jimmie con-
tinued still smiling  you wear colors
well for a woman with a dark com-
plexion

  the light and airy chatter that always
prefaces the serious phases of conversa-
tion took its course and jimmie soon
found himself beside the big armchair

  gently he placed his hand  the soft

hair of the woman just as if he had ex-
pected resistance-but she offered none
he knew she would not and his arm stole
around her shoulders and slipped down
to her waist he sat  the arm of her
chair and whispered  you know i love
you

  she brushed her cheek against his and
kissed him softly to her it was like a
mother kissing her son though only
three years his senior she sometimes felt
for him a maternal love or else she
imagined she did then at other tunes
she believed he had trained himself to be
a man for her sake and that he was a
man

  to-night he seemed to be more of a
man than ever

   you have a future that you must not
forget he was saying  meriel you
have a life that you must not throw away
-you must think of those days that are
to come when your raven hair will have
turned to gray you wvll long then for
a strong arm and a kind heart and if
those have nurtured you through your
young life they will make your old age
happy

   but i will have my money persisted
meriel

   money  replied jimmie as he mar-
veled how a woman could think of any
thing so mercenary in the midst of his
passionate appeal  why money is
spasmodic some man will marry you
for your money and when it goes he will
desert you but as far as i am concerned
meriel you can give it away cast it to
the winds and let me be your slave

   no jimmie i would never do that
 then do not bring it into my af-
fairs it is yours keep it but tell
me is my love anything to you
hesitatingly meriel answered  yes
 meriel i love you for yourself alone
i will always love you and be true to you
my life will be devoted to making you
happy will you marry me and end this
agony of suspense will you dear
he was kneeling before her so that
his arms were around her and her face
close to his he looked her squarely in
the eyes color came to her cheeks her
lips quivered as she answered

    yes

  in the moment of intensity that fol-
lowed neither heard the bell ring and


the railroad mans magazine

neither heard the stiff butler as he
opened the door nor saw the robust form
of bertrand clivers as he entered unan-
nounced

  meriel was crying softly with her head
on her lovers shoulder-crying because
perhaps she could see a new and a good
life

  jimmie was swearing faithfulness by
all the gods in the gamut of mythology
while covering his sweethearts face with
caresses

  both started in a paroxysm of terror
at the sound of the brokers voice hey
arose and faced him and jimmies
clenched fist gave emphasis to his rage
while meriel was too surprised to speak

  clivers was keen enough to see that
deceit and craftiness should be his only
weapons it was to be war between
youth and age sentiment and commercial-
ism and he was willing to wager that he
would win

   i have disturbed you meriel i fear
your nephew i presume

  he had heard of jimmie winters but
he wanted to aim a shaft that would
pierce when it struck and few women are
capable of withstanding the blow of be-
ing called the aunt of a lover and espe-
cially when found in his arms

   you entered unannounced said
meriel

   you are not a gentleman added
jimmie hot with the fire of youthful
bravado which is always intensified at
such a moment he was willing to as-
sault the broker on the spot but meriel
with a gentle  be careful jimmie pre-
vented -the catastrophe

  clivers merely smiled he was too
much of a man of the world to be upset
by a mere stripling of a boy even if the
woman whose money he wished to marry
was in love with that boy and the
chances appeared to be in his favor

  clivers grasped the whole affair at
once he needed no one to tell him that
jimmie had proposed to meriel and that
meriel had accepted him nor did lie
need a verescope to picture the future of
the woman and jimmies untiring efforts
to make her a happy wife

  he must frustrate jimmies plans at
once

   it was necessary for me to call to-
night meriel lie said with suavity

 there is a little deal on i thought
you would like to hear of it the cen-
tral western has another boom stocks
up everything gay nothing to worry
me lifes a dream-

  he brushed by the dumfounded jim-
mie and sat in the blue armchair

   made a million in central to-day
a cool million  i must go away for a
few days and just came to say good-by
but introduce your friend i like to
know young men pleased im sure
mr winters may give you a tip in the
street some day and if i do take it-
take it

  jimmie nodded a cold response at the
introduction all the wealth of wall
street could not lure him from meriel
and to have his best purpose thwarted
just at its most critical moment was some-
thing that he could not endure

   mr clivers he said curtly  your
presence is undesirable i may say that
you have interrupted a most private con-
versation in a manner that reflects on
your position as a gentleman i beg you
to excuse yourself

   i must see mrs-er-er-toylmore
i have something important to tell her
said clivers

   then tell her and make it as brief
as possible

   but it is private

   it cannot be too private for me to
hear mrs toylmore has agreed to
marry me

  clivers never flinched it was just
what he had expected

   dear me dear me he said with a
sardonic smile heres a chance for
congratulations meriel im sure you
know how much i wish you happiness
the situation became unpleasant
meriel and jimmie wanted to be alone
but clivers did not so he stayed under
one pretense or another until jimmie felt
that he could have devoured him as a cat
devours a mouse-and with just as little
mercy	-

  the lxy was in the throes of anger
but the coolness of the elder man kept
him from giving vent to it it had al-
ways been jimmies custom never to let
any one get the better of him in polite-
ness

  when the time came to go he did not
linger with meriel but walked out into
president of the line



the street with the broker and when the
first car came along though it carried
him in the wrong direction he boarded
it after a sharp  good night 

  the next morning he was at the home
of meriel early enough to partake of her
late breakfast in his vociferous endeav-
ors to tell her how true he meant to be
how trustworthy and faithful he let slip
sufficient in the presence of the butler to
give that flunky an excuse to tell the rest
of the servants

  when breakfast was over he sat with
his bride-to-be in a corner of her draw-
ing-room and there he swore again and
again the eternal undying unflinching
love of an honest man

  meriel believed him-she had no rea-
son to doubt his sincerity she promised
to be his and to marry him just as soon
as the dressmakers could fit her out

  jimmie in a whirlpool of delight said
a fond  an revoir  and flitted away to
boston to break the news to his mother

  the night jimmie left clivers called
to see mrs toylmore what could the
man want she thought what was his
motive for being so persistent she had
to see him she supposed she could not
turn away so old a friend

   you look well to-night she re-
marked as she beheld him for he had
gone to the extreme of dress for this spe-
cial occasion he knew he looked well
and as he drew up before the fire he
remarked yes everything is lovely
the little deal in denver you know

   ah that yet  said meriel  how
has it panned out

  just two millions cool and clean
bought a home on the avenue and cor-
nered wheat to-day will make the oil-
boys look like drowned rats to-morrow
they will call me napoleon yet

  meriel smiled faintly a tiny demon

to be 

 within her whispered that it might have
 been all hers and then a big demon
 who was sitting near her told her the
 same thing-but it was all false and so
 fatal

   could the woman have seen the true
  deal in denver she would have be-
 held only a heap of papers signed and
 sealed and written in high - sounding
 phrases that are undiscernible but awe-
 inspiring to the victim the world is
 full of such papers and the victims are
 born every minute

   the door - bell rang the noise it
 made was louder and sharper than usual
 it pierced the womans heart and made
 her start

    a telegram madam said the butler
   a telegram from jimmie it read

     mother is ill must remain here at
   least three clays longer than i intended
   she gives her consent i know youre
   happy

   when jimmie had started for home
 his heart outran the fleeting train in its
 eager desire to greet its new-found mate
 his hopes were made new and glorious
 at the thought of seeing meriel again-
 and preparing for their wedding

   he hailed the first cab after leaving
 the train and gave a command to be
 executed without delay thrusting a
 five-dollar bill in the drivers hand he
 almost bounded up the stone steps of the
 toylmore mansion and pressed the elec-
 tric button

   is mrs toylmore in he inquired
 with a touch of expectant joy

   the stiff butler with the dignity due
 his position dryly answered

 mrs-er-er-clivers and her hus-
band left for europe day before yester-
day she instructed me to say that they
will not return until the winter season

the first locomotive race

by c f carter

what would you think of a locomotive race similar to the event de-
scribed in mr carters article taking place to-day wouldnt
it be looked upon as a silly proposition-bunching a lot of locomotives
against one another like so many race-horses and yet-sixty years ago-
it was something of a rare sport this old-timer tale shows better than
facts and figures the wonderful development in the steam-locomotive since
the day when it was entered in a racing event to amuse the public

the addison gilmore looked like a sure winner but she was
disqualified for carrying steam pressure above the
prescribed limit- pounds

railroad craze was then at its height
under these circumstances the sugges-
tion of a locomotive race was hailed as
an inspiration

  all the railroads as well as all the
locomotive manufacturers which includ-
ed almost every machine-shop in the
country were invited to send locomotives
to take part in the race and also to ex-
hibit railroad appliances

  the new england association of
railroad superintendents the first rail-
road organization was invited to take
charge of the race the invitation was
accepted andwaldo higginson l til-
ton and william p parrott were ap-
pointed judges

but still a  race

  the first thing the committee did was
to call the  race  a  test which was
less calculated to make the strong popu-
lar appeal desired than the  race  hit
upon by the middlesex mechanic asso-
ciation fortunately the newspapers and
the public could not be deceived by any

           hen the middlesex
mechanic associa-
tion was racking its
collective brain for a
star attraction that
would insure a good
attendance at its  exhibition of im-
provements in the mechanic arts and
manufactured articles which was to
open in lowell massachusetts septem-
ber   some genius whose name has
not been preserved proposed a loco-
motive race

  as it was only twenty years since
phineas davis had built the  york
which won the prize of four thousand
dollars offered by the  baltimore and
ohio railroad for the best locomotive
the railroad was still a good deal of a
novelty in which popular interest was
lively

  people were still writing letters to the
newspapers describing the delights of
railroad travel and arguing that it was
the best method ever invented for get-
ting over the ground its possibilities
were beginning to be understood and the
the first locomotive race



high-sounding scientific talk they knew
a race when they saw it no matter what
it was called and as a race the affair
continued to be described in print

  certainly the conditions read as if
governing a race and the prizes were for
speed alone passenger-locomotives were
required to show their speed with a steam
pressure between  and  pounds
hauling a train furnished by the agent
of the boston and maine which con-
sisted of six covered freight-cars each
containing a load of five tons and one
long passenger-car containing twenty-
one men

  the train which was assumed to be
equivalent to six loaded passenger-cars
weighed  tons  it was  feet long 
feet high above the rail and  feet wide
thus displacing  cubic feet of air

  the engines were to start at a given
signal from the fifteenth mile-post num-
bering from boston on the boston and
lowell railroad and run to the twenty-
fourth mile-post the engine that cov-
ered the nine miles in the shortest time
was to get a gold medal the second
prize was a silver medal

  the freight-engines were to be tried
like draft-horses for their power to haul
heavy loads yet they were to race the
same as the passenger-engines-those
covering the distance in the shortest time
to get a gold medal

the course for freights

  there were no dynamometers nor any-
thing else to test the draw-bar pull in-
deed no one knew anything about draw-
bar pull the train was to consist of 
loaded freight-cars but as the total
weight of the train was only  tons
they could not have been very large cars

  the course for the freight-engines
was a branch  feet long connecting
the boston and lowell with the boston
and maine at wilmington massachu-
setts at the signal each engine was to
back its train up an  inclined plane 
with the terrific grade of fourteen feet
to the mile on reaching the top of
the hill the engineer was to reverse and
make the best time he could to the other
end of the course

  ten locomotives were entered at
length the great days arrived-wednes-

day and thursday october  and 
 a great crowd assembled at the
fifteenth mile-post for the passenger
race was to take place first

disgusted and disqualified

  the first to start was the  addison
gilmore just from the shops of the
amoskeag manufacturing company
the october sun was reflected from fresh
varnish glittering steel and polished
brass until it dazzled beholders the
contrast between the  addison gil-
more  and the other engines which had
been taken from their regular work on
the road predisposed the crowd toward
it and it was a strong favorite in the
betting

  there was a wild cheer as the  addi-
son gilmore with steam roaring from
its safety-valve darted away at the sig-
nal and soon disappeared in a cloud of
smoke and dust in a little more than
half an hour the prize beauty of the loco-
motive contest came puffing back with a
disgusted-looking engineer lolling dis-
consolately out of the cab-window

  the  gilmore  had been disqualified
for carrying steam pressure above the
prescribed limit her time for the 
miles was  minutes  seconds which
the crowd considered pretty fast

   the essex an inside connected en-
gine belonging to the boston and lowell
with cylinders x inches and a
single pair of drivers six feet in diameter
was the next to couple on to the racing-
train the distance was covered in 
minutes  seconds

  this increased the popular wrath
against the engineer of the  addison
gilmore whose bungling had disquali-
fied his swift racer

the heaviest entry

  but the next contestant the  nathan
hale belonging to the boston and
worcester also inside connected with
two pairs of drivers five and a half feet
in diameter took the popular breath
away by getting over the course in the
remarkably fast time of  minutes 
seconds-almost two minutes less than
the  gilmores  time

there was another  addison gil-


the railroad mans magazine

more  entered owned by the western
railroad built a few months before by
hinckley  drury this engine was
something of a novelty it had outside
connections while eight out of the ten
entered in the race had inside connec-
tions it had cylinders  x  inches
and a single pair of drivers  feet 
inches in diameter it was the heaviest
engine entered weighing  pounds
less than one-eighth of the weight of one
of the mallet engines now in use on the
erie

  this  addison gilmore  established
its claim to the gold medal and drew fav-
orable attention to outside connections by
covering the nine miles in   minute-
 seconds the silver medal was award-
ed to the  nathan hale

  the race for freight-engines was won
by the  milo also built by hinckley
 drury and owned by the boston and

lowell a monster with cylinders  x
 inches three pairs of drivers four feet
in diameter and a total weight in work-
ing trim of j tons time for the
 feet  minutes  seconds

  the silver medal for freight-engines
was won by the st clair owned by the
ogdensburg railroad in  minutes 
seconds the  st clair  was inside
connected with cylinders x inches
two pairs of drivers  feet  inches in
diameter and weighed  pounds

  the locomotive race was a great suc-
cess as a popular attraction and it also
pleased the railroad men the commit-
tee apologized for not being able to find
out more about locomotives but excused
itself on the ground that it had no pre-
cedents to guide it as nothing of the
kind had ever been attempted except the
rainhill trials in england twenty years
before

nearly one thousand employees of the

  what the crabbed employee is likely to do

             by irwin thomas

three  trunks were shipped to san francisco-
they were heavy and nobody claimed them

ansome sit down  said the
superintendent of the western
express company - when a
tall lank shrewd-eyed
sinewy-looking man came
into his office in response
to a request that the superintendent
wished to see the chief of detectives

   whats the trouble now mr bai-
ley asked ransome as he slid into a
chair

   this is one i have had passed to me
from the pacific division said the su-
perintendent  they say it is up to the
new york office and maybe it is for
six months ransome this company has
been robbed of thousands of dollars-
not stolen in money but in labor and
charges

   ill tell it to you briefly then you
can take this correspondence and look it
over i want you to work on it person-
ally because it must be stopped

  last july some one shipped three
trunks c o d to san francisco they
were wonders they were tied with rope
and reenforced with slats-and they
stood the trip they weighed two hun-
dred and forty pounds or more each
they never were claimed that was the
beginning since then in boxes and bar-
rels and in wrapping-paper this fellow
has been shipping bricks old iron and
anything that will weigh to some ficti-
tious person in san francisco

   he has shipped from boston new
york philadelphia and one shipment
two hundred pounds of what was part of
an old anchor came from halifax

   this stuff has been going over every
day or every week there are probably
half a dozen shipments between here and
the coast now theres a storehouse full
of junk out there we were some months
getting on to it and did not realize what
we were up against until we were getting

nr


the railroad mans magazine

ready for a sale of unclaimed express
the trunks were the first opened they
were filled with old bricks

   i think the fellow is a lunatic but
we must land him because we are getting
so that any time a man offers a particu-
larly heavy bit of merchandise we feel
like we are being done what do you
think

   maybe its the work of a bug but it
looks to me like a grouch replied ran-
some  maybe some fellow who has
been fired and who was working on the
run out west and just likes to think of
the man who has his job wrestling with
a ton of junk or maybe he is getting
even with the company

   well get at it ransome get busy
and see what you can do and let me
know what you find out ill give you
anything else that turns up on it and
the superintendent turned over to the de-
tective a mass of correspondence inclu-
ding the way-bills for the junk that was
piling up in the san francisco office and
storage-house

  the way-bills showed the shipments
they had come from hotels had been
carried into branch offices by express-
men -and expressed at new york in
philadelphia the stuff had all been car-
ried to the offices there were no de-
scriptions of the man because in the
time that had elapsed clerks could not
remember him

   hes been a busy man commented
the detective as he ran over the ship-
ments more than forty in all then he
made a note of the date of the shipments
in new york and those in philadelphia
and boston and the one from halifax

   thats a pyramid said ransome
he started this in new york went to
philadelphia came back to new york
went to boston then to halifax fie
was gone two weeks and came back to
boston made three shipments from there
and returned to new york

   the man i want was in new york
on these dates in philadelphia on these
in boston on these and in halifax when
this shipment was made it looks like
halifax as a starter

  four days later ramome was in hali-
fax

  the hotel registers of the city were
copied for the week from the express-

agent it was learned that the package
consigned to san francisco had been de-
livered by some one in a cab that was
about all he remembered

  the records of the boston hotels were
obtained for the week before and the
week after the episode for two days
ransome sat with an assistant in boston
and checked off the names through this
system of comparison the names of twen-
ty-five persons who had been in halifax
for a week and who had been in boston
a week before and a week after were
found by the detective

  during the work of eliminating this
that or the other from the list ransome
was interrupted by a telegram which
called him to new york to see mr
bailey

   your friend has been working out
west said bailey when ransome came
into the honie office  we have uncov-
ered a box of sand a trunk filled with
old bricks from the fire in san francisco
and a barrel of empty tin cans and scrap-
iron all told they weigh about five hun-
dred pounds and are in the unclaimed
package-room here in new york there
is probably a ton of this stuff on the road
now

   it looks to me like one of these was
the person said ransome displaying
his list and explaining how he obtained
it

   thats intelligent work if it isnt
anything else replied the superintend-
ent  but cant you get more men to
help you

   im going to take three men to phila-
delphia to-day and by to-morrow will
have a closer line on this thing than we
have now this is something that can-
not be done in a minute

   i know  but it has got to be cleared
up i have sent out a circular asking
agents to note particularly any one ex-
pressing more than one hundred pounds
to san francisco unless the person is a
well-known shipper that may bring
results

  the offices of the superintendent were
in the rear of the general receiving de-
partment of the main office the con-
versation of ransome and bailey was in-
terrupted by the appearance of fogarty
a receiving clerk

   mr bailey said fogarty  i didnt
the bricks that went c o d



want to come in unannounced but
theres a man outside that comes under
the head of that circular sent out to-day
hes shipping two boxes to a man at a
hotel in san francisco they weigh
over one hundred pounds each theyre
almost as heavy as lead

   hes expressing them c o d and
when i asked him what was in them he
said it was none of my business-that the
value was nominal you can see him
through the glass door i made an ex-
cuse to get away and thought id tell
you

  at the counter stood a fussv-looking
little old man who when fogarty came
out was fuming at the delay

   here i want my express receipts
for these boxes my times limited i
got none to waste on a lot of understrap-
pers around here he said

   but you ought to say whether that is
merchandise or not said fogarty play-
ing for time while ransome went around
the office and obtained a good look at the
man

   you just back up young fellow re-
plied the other it doesnt make any
difference whether one box contains sew-
er-pipe or bricks and the other contains
green cheese im shipping them and
you are a common carrier youve got
to take them i demand it of you 

   on these heavy shipments to the
coast we generally like to know who is
sending them sometimes the man to
whom they are consigned doesnt want to
receive them said the clerk politely

   from my knowledge of an express
company the consignee has tune to grow
old and die before the stuff arrives there
now if you are so absolutely inquisitive
about the contents of those boxes one
contains bricks-b-r-i-c-k-s - bricks
and the other contains bricks-
b-r-i-c-k-s-bricks and theres my
card

  the old man fairly shrieked it ran-
some heard him and so did bailey

   excuse me but what is the trou-
ble inquired ransome coming for-
ward

  no trouble i am trying to ship
some stuff here-trying to let this mo-
nopoly make a few dollars-and this per-
son here who hasnt the intelligence of
a second man at a bootblack-stand wants
to know my business wants to make my
business his-business my name is george
washington wallingford im a-

   were you in boston and halifax last
summer and did you register as g w
wallingford asked ransome quickly
with the knowledge of that name on his
suspect-list

   i certainly was there and i didnt

maybe its the work ok a bug but it looks to me like a grouch

   	r r


the railroad mans magazine

register as any one else replied the old
man  and let me tell you im not
ashamed of my name  

 come with me said ransome
 come in and see the superintendent

 i dont want to lie hard on the young
fool said the old man  if you will

and what for asked wallingford
 is he sick

  mr wallingford its got to stop
 said bailey

  well you are the people to stop it
 you cant expect your customers to stop
 it replied the old man calmly  when

the consignee
has time to grow
old and die be-
fore the stuff
arrives

just speak to him and let him know that
he ought to be civil and polite and you
cant get along in the world by acting as
he is-that will be all

  ransome led him into the office of the
superintendent

   this is our man said ransome
 been in boston and halifax and ad-
mits he is shipping bricks now

   what do you mean demanded the
old man

   now mr wallingford you have
been shipping a lot of bricks and junk
through our company and you had bet-
ter make a clean breast of it said bai-
ley  this is a very serious matter

   you bet its a serious matter-a
young clerk out there poking his nose
into my business i dont want him
fired replied wallingford

   i think we ought to get an ambu-
lance said ransome

a things wrong in my business i stop
it

   now mr wallingford we dont
want any scene we are going to call
an ambulance youre ill and you go
along with the doctor when he comes
said bailey

  i go with a doctor  exploded the
old fellow  i go with a doctor i go
with a doctor whats the matter here
what does this mean  

   dont get violent said ransome

   im not getting violent but you can
ship those bricks or leave them he said
im busy but remember i delivered
those bricks to you to-day and they want
to be on their way to-night im going
that taxicab is eating its head off

  he started for the door ransome
barred the way

   what is this what does this
mean   demanded the old man
the bricks that went c o d



   now dont get excited said ran-
some you must stay here till we get
an ambulance or we will call a police-
man

  great peppers exclaimed the old
man  i dont understand this flim-
flam game but may i use that phone 

   yes said bailey and the old man
took up the receiver while ransome whis-
pered to a clerk to get the policeman on
the post and tell him to call an ambu-
lance for a crazy man

  hallo is this the office of judge
johnson asked the old man when he
obtained his connection it was and he
requested to be switched onto the judges
wire

   hallo judge said wallingford a
bit excited  this is george w wal-
lingford im in some scrape over here
in the western express companys office
i think  am accused of larceny bur-
glary train-robbery and in addition am
threatened with incarceration no i
dont know come over and find out
what its about

  turning from the phone the old man
said  my attorney will be here in about
a minute hes just over at no ill
and i guess well find out whos who

  while waiting for the arrival of the
lawyer and the ambulance the trio sat in
silence wallingford snorting now and
then it was not a long wait johnson
was the first to arrive

  whats the matter asked johnson
as he came in by reputation he was
known to the superintendent of the ex-
press company he was in class  a
plus some  among attorneys

   i dont know said wallingford
 im a prisoner ask the jailers this
fellow is the main warden pointing to
bailey

  johnson turned inquiringly and bai-
ley said

   for months this old man has been
shipping brick and everything else to
a supposititious person in the west
theres tons of trash in our unclaimed
department sent by him and now he tries
to ship two more boxes of brick hes a
lunatic and we want him locked up

   i aint a lunatic and i never
shipped any brick by express in my life
before to-day said wallingford hotly
rising and shaking his fist at bailey

  what if you did said johnson
 thats not a criminal offense if you
want to ship the whole output of your
brick-yard and tile-works by express
these people have to carry it there
was the clang of an ambulance-bell out-
side and a white-coated doctor and a po-
liceman hurried in

   stay out there for a minute said
johnson closing the door and then turn-
ing to bailey   mr wallingford is not
in need of the services of a physician
now if he goes away from here he goes
as a prisoner what is your charge
whats it all about

   hes been shipping this junk said
bailey

   i said youre a liar i say it again 
interrupted the old man

   hes getting violent said ransome

   im losing the biggest contract that
was ever let in the west if those two
boxes of bricks arent in san francisco
in time for the contractor to show the
kind of material he proposes to use 
blurted the old man

   i dont care what you do about ar-
resting me but those bricks must get
off to san francisco to-night do you
suppose i would have brought them into
the general office here and hired a taxi-
cab if i didnt want them to go do you
suppose that i wished every one to know
that the guardian tile and brick com-
pany was figuring on putting k plant in
california if it got the contract po-
king your nose in my business why
johnson these people are a lot of idiots
it all started with that whipper-snapper
out there with the fish eyes and sloping
forehead 

  he pointed to fogarty

  guardian tile and brick company
contracts a lawyer and the few other
things caused a shortening of sail  the
part of bailey and ransome

  bailey even offered to explain every-
thing if mr wallingford would be quiet
johnson said his client would but it must
be understood he made no waiver to any
rights he had in a suit as he had been
detained a prisoner bailey then told
what had aroused the suspicions of the
company of course bailey and ran-
some were sorry for the mistake

  with a lawyer seeing everything and
taking everything at its legal value there


the railroad mans magazine

were no difficulties except that the
brick manufacturer justly indignant was
threatening suit

   you dont think he will sue do
you   asked ransome

   no said bailey johnsons a sen-
sible man his business is largely with
corporations and he understands but it
has shown us one thing-we cannot be
too careful a coincidence like this is
likely to happen any time

  the telephone-bell rang and mr bai-
ley answered it when he had finished
with the person on the wire he turned
to ransome and said 

   that was the agent in jersey city
he says that while unloading a grand
piano or what was supposed to be one-
it being in a piano-box-the thing
dropped on the platform and was
wrecked as near as he can make out it
contains what was once a fire-escape and
was packed in excelsior it weighed
eleven hundred pounds and was shipped
from st louis four days ago can you
beat that 

  i cant even tie it replied ran-
some  our man is working east he
is one of the men whose name is on this
list im going to save time and wire
this list to st louis and ask an agency
there to look over the hotel registers and
find if any one of these men were in st
louis within the past week

   do it now said bailey

  in an hour the list with a request that
every hotel be combed was in the hands
of a private detective agency in st louis
orders also went to the express-agent to
get every particular as to the shipment
of a piano on the date mentioned and
advised him that mr ransome would be
in st louis the following afternoon

  there was just time to catch the twen-
ty-four-hour train to the mound city
and ransome went west on it when he
arrived he found everything waiting for
him the only man f the twenty-five
on his list who had been in st louis was
george w wallingford who had regis-
tered at one of the hotels wallingford
had been there attending a conference of
manufacturers and had made an address
before the gathering on the utilization of
a combination of steel and clay and iron
and clay in fire-brick

  ransome gasped as he obtained a de-

scription of the man and recognized the
one who less than a day and a half be-
fore had been shipping bricks in the
main office in new york from the ex-
press-agent it was learned that he had
found that the man who shipped the stuff
had purchased a piano - box across the
street where there had been a fire in
which the fire-escape had been badly
twisted by the heat

   the purchaser had had part of the es-
cape packed into the box and had or-
dered it shipped to the guardian tile
and brick company of new jersey

  the next morning ransome sent a
telegram to superintendent bailey tell-
ing him all and that he would be in
new york next day

   well said ransome when he
showed up at the office of the superin-
tendent whats he say now

   we gathered up the piece of scrap-
iron the best we could and wallingford
paid thirty-three dollars express on it
without a murmur but he has been on
the phone since demanding some part of
the junk that he says is missing

   i went over and saw johnson he
says that it is all right-that the old man
bought the iron because it had been
through fire and subjected to a terrific
heat he wishes to do something in the
combination of fire-brick and iron and
wanted that stuff for laboratory experi-
ments pie wanted that particularly be-
cause a lot of manufacturers out there
saw the fire and he proposes to demon-
strate some theory that he expounded at
their annual convention i guess w-ksttl
better cut wallingford out of any future
consideration in this matter

   im willing to cut him out but he
insists upon butting in said ransome

    this looks to me as if it will have
to be solved by chance said bailey

    not at all replied the detective
 it will come by the process of elimina-
tion wallingford was the exception
that proved the rule if he had not
butted in the chances are the hotel regis-
ters of philadelphia would have elimi-
nated him although with a factory in
jersey it is more than likely he will be
found registered at philadelphia too
im going there in the morning

  ransome was gone for several days
there came no word of him and there
the bricks that went c o d



you had better make a clean breast of jt

were no more shipments of junk record-
ed so far as known from the south one
day bailey received a telegram which
read

    all over but the shouting am start-
  ing home	ransome

  for two days bailey fretted with anx-
iety

   i wont ask you to guess said ran-
some when he arrived

   this was a purely speculative propo-
sition on the part of a band of crooks
who did not have the courage to crack a
safe said the detective

   in philadelphia there was just one
man left when i began to look him up
i found that he had a police record
further i learned that at one time he
had worked for us and later had
worked for the pullman company in
time he was discharged for crookedness

   he is now in the georgia peniten-
tiary for forgery he conceived the plan
and it was all with the hope of making
a few hundred dollars- through his for-
mer connections which were n san fran-

cisco and through a clerk here who has
since left the service he hoped for aid

   he learned from railroad reports
that express packages frequently go
astray for which the company must pay

   when the opportunity presented it-
self in new york he gathered a box or
two filled them with stuff and shipped
them to san francisco his friend there
was informed of the shipment and kept
him informed as to its arrival what
gave him the idea was that he lost a uni-
form while he was in the pullman serv-
ice and we paid him what it cost him

   he figured that the longer the haul
the greater the chance of its being lost
he shipped from points east until he was
shifted to the west and then he shipped
to points east he generally stopped at
one of the commercial hotels

   he used any name he wanted-never
his own and never the same name twice
two packages were never delivered to
this office and he has claims against the
company the claim he said was being
put forth in the name of a friend in san
francisco who according to him is per-
fectly innocent


the railroad mans magazine

   its for a box that weighed one hun-
dred pounds shipped last october his
working partner here in the office advised
him that it did not arrive he directed
me to a friend in atlanta who had his
effects there i got these and ran-
some drew forth several dozen receipts

   good work ransome  said bailey
 yes but let us be thankful that he
committed forgery

  just then a clerk came in and said
that an old man was outside

   show him in said bailey and g
washington wallingford entered

   delighted to see you mr walling-
ford said the pair in chorus  what
can we do for you

to me that you can do look at that
telegram thats from my traveling
salesman   he read this telegram 

  g washington wallingford  have
  been arrested and held here as a sus-
  picious person because i was seeking in-
  formation about shipment of bricks
  express company the complainant says
  i am a lunatic contractor gets in
  from spokane to-morrow must have
  bricks to close with him wont let
  me have a lawyer and wont even let
  me pay for bricks have them as evi-
  dence

              andkew mcschlapp

  what kind of concern is this de-
manded wallingford

   ill attend to it right away ill
telegraph to san francisco replied mr
bailey and he wrote

  agent san francisco big mistake
  made in arrest of mr andrew mc-
  sdhlapp release him at once with-
  draw complaint and give the bricks to
  him has no connection with other
  shipments advise me at once of his
  release must act quickly

                bailey superintendent

   he will be released five minutes
after this gets there said bailey  give
me your telephone number and ill call
you in an hour or so

   telephone judge johnson 

   im through youre too much for
me said wallingford hes drawing
papers now for suits against this com-
pany and if i ever ship another brick by
express ill forfeit the right to be known
by my front name good day and

simplify railroad language

ja reeves general freight agent of

	the oregon short line is quoted in
deprecation of the terminology employed in
many railroad affairs and believes it is
responsible for much misunderstanding
arising between the public and railroads in
elucidating this he says 

   such terms as a blanket-rate for in-
stance we use in this office every few
minutes and we are too apt to forget that
it means absolutely nothing to the average
business man to us it is clear as crystal
and when we as railroad men try to talk
to the public we naturally fall into the ex-
pressions of our everyday life

   take doctors for instance t for one
know that the usual conversation or written
articles by a physician is all greek to me
he scares me to death with a name a foot
long that after  have looked in the dic-
tionary i find means only a sore throat

   so it is to a large extent in the railroad

business now take the expression  mile-
age rate to a railroad man nothing could
be plainer but i have come to know that to
the average intelligent citizen it means
nothing

  class rates commodity rates dif-
ferentials  demurrage  what the traffic will
bear joint cost constructive mileage
 water competition  grading back  dis-
tributing points  basing points  zones
 postage-stamp rate -all these expressions
appear to be a language used only by rail-
road men and those few others whose busi-
ness throws them into close contact with
shipping and freight matters in general

   i will admit that it is up to the railroads
to tell what they have to say in plain english
and not in the peculiar lingo we talk among
ourselves i do not know of a single book
that explains the subject of rates for in-
stance in plain everyday language commonly
understood by the average citizen

how is wrought iron made 
what was the earliest process for
making steel-m s p phila-
delphia

   wrought iron is the product of the
puddling process it is made in a rever-
beratorv furnace by melting pig iron  a
hearth of iron oxide over which passes a
reducing flame which causes the carbon to
unite with the oxide during the mixing
which the puddler gives it and further
causes a large portion of the impurities to
enter the surrounding slag as the im-
purities-carbon manganese phosphorus
sulfur silicon-leave the molten iron the
melting point rises so that the iron becomes
first viscous then pastv

  when it has been worked into a ball the
puddler carries it still at a welding-heat
to the hammer or squeezer where the
greater part of the slag which permeated
it is expelled from the mass the roughly
shaped slab is then rolled into muck bar
which latter when piled rolled and rerolkd
becomes the wrought iron of commerce

  	the cementation process is the old-
est for making steel and was founded on
the fact that wrought iron if packed in



charcoal and heated to a high temperature
while excluded from air absorbs carbon
the process consisted in packing bars of
wrought iron of about three quarter-inch
thickness in charcoal and then sealing up
the vessel and keeping it at a yellow heat
until the carbon had penetrated to the cen-
ters of the bars and converted them into
steel

  it was a slow procedure as the carbon
penetrated only at the rate of one-eighth
inch in twenty-four hours the use of steel
made by this process was always limited
due to the fact that it contained the old
seams and slag marks which everywhere
crossed and recrossed the iron causing
great trouble in the manufacture of cutting
tools

  by melting this steel however in a
covered crucible the seams and fibers of
slag all disappeared and a homogeneous
ingot was the result but this was still a
long way to a steel ingot and the pursuit
of cheapness eventually gave rise to the
direct method of melting iron in a crucible
made for the purpose together with the
requisite carbon and other ingredients
necessary for imparting hardness tough-

gw yarmouth nova scotia- i you

	should not attempt the use of
cement of any grade to keep boiler-tubes
tight whether on a model boiler or not
we cannot recommend any cement because
we dont know of any which would be
satisfactory in the presence of heat and
water conditions if the tubes are properly
set which of course must be done no
cement or any other agent is necessary

  	steam gages can be secured in
any size and for any desired indication

  	sixteen years is rather young to
enter railroad service in any capacity but if
you have an aptitude for mechanical prob-
lems as your letter suggests our advice
would be for you to enroll as an apprentice
with one of the big roads you could not
get  as fireman for some time anyhow
and it might be that contact with the ma-
chinists trade would prove so pleasing that
you would forget all about your idea of
some day running an engine better make
haste slowly in decisions of this kind

why is it necessary for a train that is
on a siding to be moving slowly
while being passed why not let it
stand still

  	when a coach or any other kind of
track becomes dry and a hot box occurs
while the train is running at the rate of
forty-five miles per hour what is liable to
happen to the truck or wheel

  	why are the rates more coming
from the west to the east than they are
going from the east to the west-h d
p cleveland ohio

  o you are either mixed or your
question has mixed us there is no such
proceeding the freight-trains generally
pull down to the end of the turn-out in the
direction in which they are moving to al-
low room for any other freight which may
come up behind there is little room for
any maneuvering with the long freight-
trains of to-day

  	nothing will happen as the hot box
will be discovered and the proper remedy
applied before any serious phase is assumed
of course to deliberately run the box with-
out attention might result in the journal be-
coming so hot that it would twist off but
this is a very rare accident and must have

unpleasant consequences for whoever is
responsible

  	the rate business is a queer game
and to be candid we dont know it has
been suggested that the reason for the dif-
ference in the territory west of chicago is
to favor the home-seekers and colonists
the same consideration of course not apply-
ing in the travel from west to east this
seems reasonable

tional safeguards

base is concerned but there is a wide lati-
tude in the boilers and other features of de-
sign as your questiou asked particularly
about the wheel arrangement this will no
doubt supply the information they have an
engine-truck with a single pair of wheels
eight connected drivers-four per side of
course-and no trailer the weight is ap-
proximately  tons

  	the road referred to has quite a
good freight business and has increased its
freight-cars to a present total of  we
cannot recall any part of it having six
tracks although in many places four tracks
are in evidence

tion operators

wh e haswell colorado-the sec-

	ond-hand on a railroadmans watch
or any other watch excepting a stop-watch
is not of any particular value save that it
indicates exactly the variation of the time-
piece from the chronometer or standard
clock by which the watch is regulated
road men compare with this latter when-
ever opportunity permits and get naturally
a much better line  what their watches
are doing than if they had to depend on the
minute-hand alone
by the light of the lantern



  every roadman as a rule knows exactly
the variation exhibited by the watch lie
carries when the watch leaves the in-
spector after one of the periodical ex-
aminations it is set to have the second-
hand run evenly with the minute-hand and
it will continue to do so unless the owner
allows it to run down and fails to use
proper care in properly setting the minute-
hand when he starts it

fairly good for steam-railroadmen on the
west coast better of course in southern
california than in the immediate vicinity
of san francisco as there are less men to
draw from having had experience in the
dual capacities of fireman and brakeman
you should not experience any particular
trouble in getting work the pay is gener-
ally much better than in the east we never

what causes an injector to make a
clicking sound when working

       	what effect does it have on a
water pump to reduce the size of the suc-
tion-pipe say to half the original size and
just what effect would it have especially on
a high lift-p j f mechanicsville new
york

  	there is a clicking noise at times
when an injector is being started and also
when shut off in both instances this being
the seating of the check-valve any such
noise when the instrument is supposed to
be working is a pretty good indication that
it is about to break you of course
understand that when an injector is work-
ing perfectly there is always a continuous
and rather harmonious accompanying sound
due to the speed of the delivery-stream
through the long branch pipe etc and any
variation in the familiar cadence generally

implies that something is going wrong in a
short time

  	reducing the suction of a pump
simply reduces the quantity of water sup-
plied to the plunger unless the area of the
suction is reduced too much it will not have
any material difference  the working of
the pump although the supply by the
atmospheric pressure should be as free as
possible if the supply is too greatly re-
duced it will entail hard labor  the suc-
tion end of the pump and will also cause
it to work by jerks

  for your full information and for that of

of the hours of service act which covers
this particular phase

   that it shall be unlawful for any

employee subject to this act to be or re-
main on duty for a longer period than six-
teen consecutive hours and whenever any
such employee of such common carrier

teen hours he shall be relieved and not re-
quired or permitted again to go on duty
until he has had at least ten consecutive

has been on duty sixteen hours in the aggre-
gate in any twenty-four hour period shall
be required or permitted to continue or again
go on duty without having had at least eight
consecutive hours off duty provided that
 operator train despatches or other em-
ployee who by the use of the telegraph or

this proviso may be permitted to be and re-
main on duty for four additional hours in
a twenty-four hour period or not exceeding

ja f freeport illinois-the idea of

	three tracks for certain special con-
ditions of traffic has been advocated for
many years but has not been carried out
anywhere that we know of in the thorough
acceptance of a three-track road the ar-
rangement is intended to solve the problem
presented in an unequal balance of the
traffic at certain times of the day

  for instance over the erie railroad
entering jersey city it is all inbound in the
morning and all outbound in the late after-
noon a third track which you -suggest
could help out the inbound moveiaent in the
morning and reversing its functions help
out the outbound in the evening a train

rw h bunglass canada-a more

	accurate calculation would certainly
be secured in arriving at tractive effort by
squaring the piston diameter and multiply-
ing this result by  but this renders the
formula somewhat cumbersome and does
not materially affect the result this re-
finement lias at all events been omitted in
the accepted formula which we quoted in
the december lantern department the
rule given by m n forney in his valuable
catechism of the locomotive is

   multiply together the area of the piston
in square inches the average effective pres-
sure in pounds per square inch on the piston
during the whole stroke and four times the
length of the stroke of the piston and
divide the product by the circumference of
the wheels ttte result will be the tractive
power exerted in pounds

  in applying the above-quoted rule it
should be borne in mind that the length of
the stroke may be taken in feet inches or
any other measure but in making the calcu-
lation the circumference of the wheels
must be taken in the same measure as the
stroke of the piston the mean effective
pressure is in all cases generally assumed to
be  per cent of boiler pressure and many

years experience covering the study of
thousands of indicator-cards shows this to
be a safe working factor

  however the accurate way for calcula-
ting the average or mean pressure is to
divide the length of the pistons stroke in
inches by the number of inches at which
the steam is cut off the quotient is the
ratio of expansion get the hyperbolic
logarithm of the ratio of expansion from
the table of logarithms and add  to it and
divide the sum by the ratio of expansion
and multiply the quotient by the mean
absolute steam pressure in the cylinder dur-
ing its admission the result will be the
mean absolute pressure during the stroke

  to get the mean effective pressure de-
duct the atmospheric pressure formulas
in general are intended for ready applica-
tion and while few are entirely flawless they
are adequate in securing the information
desired

  	the longest according to our rec-
ords is on the buenos ayres and pacific

long in new south wales from nyngan
to bourke is a tangent  miles in length
cind this is practically as level as a billiard-
table although we have  information in
regard to how far a train can be seen
coming a little nearer home the new grand
trunk pacific will have a seventy-mile tan-
gent and on the canadian pacific line from
regina to areola there is ninety-one miles
without a curve the santa fe has about
fifty miles between fort madison iowa and
galesburg illinois we are also under the
impression that there is a tangent on the
norfolk and western between petersburg
and norfolk virginia sixty-five miles
long and which crosses the dismal swamp

 level but the coal supplied so that the sides
 and corners of the fire-box are well filled

 air is most imminent with this system

 perienced in keepingup a steady head of

  not tend to burn evenly all over the grate

what is a  seamless  tube such as
are sometimes advertised for boilers
and other purposes

  	is it really possible to make a seam-
less tube or is the name merely an attrac-
tive advertising feature-d e s ridge-
wood new jersey

  	a seamless tube is one in which the
walls have never been separated from the
time the metal was in a molten condition to
the time of the completion of the tube in
all tubes formed with a seam the edges have
first been separated then united either by-
lap or butt weld or some lock-joint system
and in these the joint cannot be eliminated
by any after processes

  	yes it is thoroughly possible to pro-
duce a seamless tube by any one of three
operations first a billet may be by suc-
cessive steps punched into the form of a
tube with extremely thick sides and these
may then by the ordinary drawing proc-


the railroad mans magazine

esses be reduced to a lube with thin walls
second the billet may be bored or the
blank may be cast with a hole in it and in
either case then be drawn to the required
dimensions

  third the tube may be made by the cup-
ping process which consists in taking a
disk of the metal forming it into a cup
shape gradually elongating the cup and re-
ducing it in diameter and finally by this
means producing a tube the extending
use of compressed air and other gases under
high pressure has developed a good demand
for these tubes for storage-tanks transmis-
sion lines etc but their general use is re-
stricted by the cost of manufacture

does the piston of an engine stop to
make a return stroke and if so how
long-h s p pittston pennsyl-
vania

  yes long enough for the motion of the
connecting-rod to change its direction from
above to below the center or vice versa
this occurs at each end of the stroke but
the duration of the actual pause is so brief

that it cannot be detected unless the parts
are at comparatively slow speed the
dead stop of the crosshead or piston is
quite noticeable in instances where rollers
are under the wheels of an engine to set
valves and in fact the stop can be felt with
the finger if the engine is not moving faster
than six miles an hour



why does a locomotive puff smoke
when in motion-g g and f s
new york city

  the steam after doing its work in the
cylinder in propelling the piston is exhausted
into the atmosphere through the smoke-

of it promptly and to create the vacuum in
the smoke arch necessary to secure the draft
through the grate and flues demanded in
the instance of the very rapid combustion
inseparable from a locomotive the vacu-
um created by the violent exhaust clears the
flues and hence the -smoke which you men-
tion is especially noticeable in most cases
while the engine is being fired

a sea of white with one or two small black
lines running to houston and shreveport
important cities of the  katy  system
the line is as much a part of the great
system as is the main line running -out of
st louis notwithstanding its detached and
fatherless condition

  just how the m k and t secured this
portion of its system is a story which runs
back many years into the days when jay
gould was the great power of the railway
world

  during the period that mr gould domi-
nated the railroads of texas he was the
owner of the international and great
northern and also president of the m k

and t the trinity-colmesneil branch was
built by the direction of gould doubtless
as a part of the great system with which
he planned to cover the whole of that
region

  later there was a division and an ap-
portionment between the different gould
companies and the trinity-colmesneil line
fell to the lot of the missouri kansas and
texas company it was then that it came
to be known as the  orphan

  true to its name the  orphan  has al-
ways caused the katy a great deal of
trouble in order to reach it expensive
and troublesome traffic agreements with
connecting lines have been necessary and
its equipment and maintenance have always
been far out of proportion to its earning
ability

  the  orphan  has never earned its keep
it has been for sale for many years but
none of the connecting lines care to buy
it is regarded as the predominating white
elephant of the  katy  system

  just now however there is a prospect
that the  orphan  is about to grow up its
owners have ordered that surveys be made
from both its east and west termini with
the view of linking it with the parent sys-
tem its present unorthodox status will
probably pass within a short period thus
making the title of  orphan  no longer ap-
plicable-edmund g kinyon
 keeping the car records

by f  w  e d e r 

one of the most important departments on a railroad but the one
which gets least glory-some of the brightest minds
on the line work there

how many people outside of a few who
go into the car-record office daily
ever think of what it is for

 the agent makes a report of all cars
handled at his station daily the con-
ductor makes a report of all cars handled
on his train and he dont always think it of
sufficient importance to follow instructions
to make out and mail daily his reports
but these same reports when they reach
the car-record office become of so great
importance that their value is only recog-
nized by those in the office

all depend on it

  there is no department of a railroad that
is not dependent on the car-record office-
from the presidents office down to a yard
clerk when the president wants to know
where his cars are and what they are earn-
ing or how many cars belonging to other
companies are on his line and what they arc
costing him this information is compiled in
the car-record office

  the general manager finds he needs cars
and wants them located he gets his in-
formation from the car-record office the
superintendent of transportation wants to
know where a car or a number of cars are
so he can trace them loaded or empty he
gets his data from the car-record office

  the general superintendent is required
to give a detailed movement of certain cars
loaded or empty lie secures it from the
car-record office and in the same way the
superintendent general yardmasters and
agents when they want any information
that they cannot secure at their own offices
or stations apply to the car-record office

 then the freight department-who fur-
nishes them information as to delays to
freight movements of cars in order to settle
claims the car-record office

  then the auditors office in order to com-
pile the earnings and expenses secures a

monthly statement of mileage and per diem
on home line and the same  home cars 
other lines so that the profits can be com-
puted the legal department calls on the
car-record office for data in suits

  the mechanical department calls on the
car-record office for movements of cars
and through the whole system every depart-
ment knows there is only one place that
certain information can be secured in order
to complete some data that shows the work-
ings of its own department

  with this importance the recording of
information permanently that involves mil-
lions of dollars yearly in railroads-how
many railroads or their officials ever think
of the great importance of the car-record
office or the scope of its usefulness

some of the real work

  in an experience of over twenty-five years
in the car-service departments of four
roads i have only known of one where the
car-record office was on its proper basis
and that was only because the head of the
office was placed in a position where he
could command the recognition that he
warranted

  t the car-record office you find some
of the brightest minds in any railroad-
minds drilled to work out details and ac-
curately show results are they known out-
side of the office very seldom

  let any one interested go into any car-
record office follow up for a day or two the
many different duties of the head of the
office or his assistants then look over what
a recorder has to do and contend with then
delve into the knotty problems of the per
diem clerks not overlooking the trace-
clerks and he will wonder when and how
it is all done in the time it is and done
so well but he will have a better and
a broader idea of where the real important
work of a railroad is done
the card on the beam

by nevil g henshaw

       cherry turner might have made the journey
       to the pan handle - but he saw a vision

fter he had read his let-
ter cherry turner bust-
er and nominal foreman
of the circle k stepped
down from the platform
of the station at kade
he was under thirty clear-eyed and
regular-featured with a face as innocent
of beard as that of a new-born babe he
was dressed in the wide stetson and flan-
nel shirt of the puncher and his trousers
were protected by a pair of dull leather
chaps-severely plain without either
fringe or buckle at his hip there hung
a  and about his neck was loosely
knotted the handkerchief of cherry red
from which he had derived his name

  the letter was scrawled in pencil upon
a sheet torn from a tablet and was dated
from the pan handle it ran 

    dear cherry last week our buster
 got throwed and broke his leg so bad the
 doc says he wont never ride no more
 buck jarvis our foreman has heard
 about you and he says if youre
 willing you can have the job he says
 liell hold off a week after which hell
 get some one else so come a running
 from your friend

                            frio jones

  cherry read the letter a second and a
third time to make sure and then thrust
it into the pocket of his shirt with an ex-
clamation of joyous amazement

    sho said he  i reckon thats go-
in some

  indeed it was for of all the great out-
fits of the state the bar circle under
buck jarvis was the most celebrated
to punch with it was in itself no small
honor to have the breaking of its mus-
tangs was to occupy a position of glory

  as he strode toward his pony cherrys
brain was in a whirl of pride and pleased
anticipation if he were willing he
could have the job if he were willing

  why there was not a puncher on the
whole gulf range or in all texas for
that matter who would not have given
his very soul to possess it and the fore-

cherry read the letter a second and a
third time to make sure


the railroad mans magazine

man would hold off for a week of that
he was sure

  that there might be no chance of his
changing his mind cherry decided that
he would leave the following morning

  he had already begun a mental pic-
ture of his triumphal progress to the
pan handle when a thought came to him
that toppled his air-castles into an abyss
of black despair how was he to make
the journey there would be the price
of his ticket and of shipping his pony
without which he would not have stirred

  thrusting a hand into the pocket of
his trousers cherry drew forth four sil-
ver dollars-the remnants of his pay-
spent in beaumont the week before save
for this amount which he had prudently
saved for tobacco and other essentials he
was penniless his companions he
knew were equally bankrupt

  for a moment he thought of the pro-
prietor of the circle k and then dis-
missed the idea as useless surely kade
his employer would not furnish the
means of ridding himself of so valuable
a man

  caught upon the horns of this di-
lemma cherry stood for a while motion-
less and thoughtful the four coins still
in his hand he had abandoned all
thought of an immediate return to the
ranch and the sight of the money cou-
pled with the heat of the sun finally
forced upon him the consciousness of a
raging thirst returning the silver to his
pocket he picked up his ponys anchoring
bridle from the ground

   sho he said  there aint no use
worryin about somethin you cant help
ill take a drink and let her straighten
herself out the best way she can

  with this philosophical reflection he
set forth toward the saloon across the-
way

ii

  lopezs saloon being of two stories
was the most imposing building at kade
cherry called for a cold bottle a luxury
that had become possible at kade through
the advent of the newly built g and i
strictly speaking the term was a polite
fiction as the beer was cooled by the
simple process of putting a piece of ice
in the glass

  having served his customer lopez re-

turned to the game of twenty-five-cent
stud poker which he was playing at a
table covered with a square of carpet

  cherry drank his beer slowly and medi-
tatively pausing now and then to listen to
the cool tinkle of the ice against the glass
when he had finished lie went over to
the card-table and began to watch the
game

  three men were playing lopez a
puncher from a neighboring ranch and a
small crafty looking individual who had
most of the chips before him

  cherry knew both lopez and the
puncher well the third man had not
the pleasure of his acquaintance although
he was a citizen of kade his name
was dorsey and he was heartily de-
spised by the punchers for it was said of
him that he allowed himself to be sup-
ported by his wife

  at cherrys approach lopez looked
up from his hand

   come on in he suggested

   sure urged the puncher  three
aint no game

  dorsey said nothing being intent upon
his cards

  after a rapid mental calculation cher-
ry drew forth his three silver dollars and
what was left of the fourth after paying
for his cold bottle

   all right he said  ill stay in
till this is gone

  he won from the start and continued
winning for the best part of an hour
most of his chips came from dorsey who
began to fall behind in the game

  dorsey took his losses in a species of
silent fury betting wildly on each card
in the hope of forcing his luck each
time that his hand was bettered he would
glare across the table at his opponent
with a look of hate in his shifty eyes and 
he kept continually repeating  i never
could have no luck in a four-handed
game	

  finally cherry grinning maliciously
replied  why dont you pull out then
and make her three-handed again  

  but dorsey shook his head

   thats all right young man lie
growled  ill git you yet jus you
wait an youll see

  as he spoke the opportunity for his
vengeance arrived

  lopez who was dealing turned up an
the card on the beam



ace for dorseys second card to
cherry he gave the queen of hearts the
others having nothing of account turned
down their hands leaving dorsey and
cherry to fight out the pot between them

having the highest card dorsey bet
off and was immediately raised by cherry

 gave it a glance and then threw a chip to
 the center

  i reckon ill take one more whirl for
 luck he said

 flush commented lopez and dealt
the fifth and final card

 in dorseys hand there now were show-

after he had raised back again his op-
ponent called and the third card was
dealt this time dorsey received a sec-
ond ace and cherry the jack of hearts
again dorsey bet and again his oppo-
nent called

  with the fourth card dorsey received
another ace and cherry the ten of hearts

  lopez settled back in his chair laying
the deck upon the table in the manner of
one who has finished with his deal

   thatll be about all remarked dor-
sey confidently as he bet again

  cherry was of a different mind care-
fully lifting the edge of his first card
which lay face down upon the table he

   	r r

ing three aces and the eight of hearts
cherry was possessed of the nine the
ten the jack and the queen of hearts

  amid the silence that followed the
completion of the hands dorseys quick
breathing could be heard distinctly
cherrys face was inscrutable as he care-
fully arranged his cards lppez and the
puncher leaned forward carefully ex-
amining the hands

  after dorsey had bet off and cherry
had raised the chips rattled furiously
until the stakes of both players were
gone

  then dorsey leaned back in his chair
pale and excited his brow was wet


the railroad mans magazine

with perspiration and there was a look
of greed and cunning in his eyes

   it sure is always my luck to git a
real hand in a measly little game like
this he complained  now if we was
playin for real money id show you some
gamblin young man

  cherry who was as calm and collected
as he had been at the beginning of the
game met this challenge with a smile

   and i reckon in that case youd find
me some willin to learn said he if
youve got any notion of takin off the
limit or any such play youll sure find
me willin to accommodate you

  a look of sneaking resolve flashed
across dorseys face and he straightened
up in his chair as though seized with a
sudden determination

  now if this was to-morrer morn-
in- he began

  and if it was interrupted cherry

   id jus bet you fifty dollars on the
hand

  a feeling of peace entered cherrys
soul and he let out his breath sharply in a
sigh of satisfaction fifty dollars and
there was almost half as much more in
chips upon the table with this amount
he could journey in princely style toward
the pan handle

  rising abruptly he went out to his
pony uncinched his saddle and carried it
into the saloon

   here he asked as he cast it upon
the floor  will you let this go as a set-
off to that bet of yourn

  dorsey examined the saddle carefully
it was a heavy affair rich with emboss-
ing and silver and it had cost its owner
a cold two hundred in san antone

   all right agreed dorsey  its a
go bring her in to-morrer mornin be-
fore train time an well turn up the
hands

  why before train time asked
cherry this was the same hour that he
had decided on in accordance with his
plans

   cause im goin to bmont

  lopez as banker of the game turned
toward the table to gather up the hands

   thats a good play boys said he
ill just lock these up in my drawer
with the pot till you need em again

   sure agreed cherry glancing to-
ward the bar then he suddenly looked
up at the heavy beam supporting the ceil-
ing that ran above it and he was struck
with an idea

   hold on  he cried  i got some-
thin bettern that

  behind the bar he found hammer and
nails going to the table he picked up
his unexposed card and returned drag-
ging a chair behind him

  the others watched in silent wonder as
he mounted the chair and nailed the card
to the beam face inward fastening it
securely at the sides and corners so that
it would be impossible for any one to
examine it without tearing its edge

   look here exploded dorsey
 what the-

   wait said cherry stepping down
to the floor  and ill put you on

   you see he continued addressing
lopez  there aint no use in clutterin
the card on the beam



up your drawer with all them cards if
this here dorsey party aint got the other
ace all i got to have is a heart to beat
him if he has got it then there aint
but one card i can turn up to help me
which is the king of hearts as hes got
the eighty i cant have no straight flush
without it

   now all you got to do is to turn up
dorseys card and see what it is and
lock up the pot in your drawer in the
mornin ill pull down my card which
i put where it wont be in no ones way

   despite its simplicity this plan did not
appeal very strongly to dorseys suspi-
cious nature

   i reckon itll be all right he said
doubtfully

  the puncher consumed with curiosity
joggled dorseys arm

   hurry up an turn her over he
urged excitedly  i sure am anxious to
see what she is

   in a breathless silence the card was ex-
posed disclosing the single spot of an-
other ace

  cherry gazed at it calmly for a mo-
ment and then turned to pick up his
saddle from the floor

   thats what  figured he said

iii

  as cherry rode back to the circle k
he was in a pleasant frame of mind
through his disposal of the buried cards
he had determined positively the contents
of his opponents hand and these con-
tents notwithstanding their strength did
not disturb him instead they rather re-
assured him and set his mind at rest

  knowing well the reputation that dor-
sey bore at kade both for cowardice and
indecision he had been afraid that in
the event of his having but three of the
aces he would fail to put in an appear-
ance on the following morning now
however there could be no doubt about
the matter dorsey would surely be
there

  as for the card on the beam cherry
thought of it jubilantly with a vision of
the pan handle dancing before his eyes

   ive got him locked ive got him
locked he muttered again and again re-
peating the words in time with the steady
thumping of his ponys hoofs

  suddenly far up the road a spot of
red appeared resolving itself as cherry
drew nearer into the figure of a little girl
she was a tiny elf-like creature with a
thick mop of black hair that was drawn
smoothly back into a pigtail and tied with
a cotton string she swung a faded sun-
bonnet as she trudged along digging her
little feet sturdily into the soft sand of
the road

  cherry drew up before her as she
stepped aside to let him pass

   hallo sis he called pleasantly
 where you goin this time of day 

  the child surveyed him thoughtfully
with lrge black eyes

   my names mline she said finally
 an im goin to the ranch

  cherry smiled in the vaguely affection-
ate manner of one who is both fond of
and unaccustomed to children

   all right mline he said  want
a lift

  with a nod of assent the child stepped
forward and cherry reached down a hand
he swung her onto his saddle and she
sat demurely before him staring out be-
tween his ponys ears

   and what you goin to do at the
ranch asked cherry jocularly after
he was under way again  not goin to
roll me for my job i hope 

  turning her head the child looked at
him severely as if to rebuke him for his
levity

   im after some shirts of mister
kades she said  maw forgot em
when she got the wash last time

   so your maw washes for the old man
does she asked cherry soberly as if
to atone for his former offense

  once more mline turned her head this
time to stare at him curiously

   sure she does didnt i jus tell you
so

  abashed and disconcerted by her steady
gaze cherry abandoned the conversa-
tion abruptly and rode for a while in
silence holding the child carefully with
one arm

   crismuss cornin soon observed
mline following the trend of her
thoughts

  cherry looked as confused as if he
had denied the assertion but a moment
before

    sho now  so it is he said guiltily


the railroad mans magazine

 and here ive done gone and plumb
forgot it whats sandy claus goin to
bring you this time mline 

   they aint no sandy claus

  cherry agreed readily

   sure they aint leastways i reckon
not in texas

   but im goin ter git a present all
right continued mline  guess what
it is

  cherry was silent for a moment feign-
ing deep thought

  how bout a doll he ventured
finally

   howd you know 

   i reckon i must have guessed it
the child smiled happily holding out
her arms in a fond cradling gesture as if
she held the subject of her thoughts

   an its goin ter be the beautifulest
doll you ever seen said she dreamily
 itll have yaller hair an chiny eyes
an a sure nuff dress what you kin take
off i dont know what ill name her
cause i aint never had one before but
i reckon ill call her mline after me
paws goin ter bring her frum bmont
cherry smiled approvingly

   your paw must be a mighty good
man he observed

  the childs eyes grew scornful

   no he aint she cried fiercely-
 paw dont never give me nothin its
maw shes bin savin up all year for
crismus an shes got a whole heap of
money-most a million dollars i reckon
shes goin ter make paw buy her a real
stove an a new dress an some of that
there tin grub an a whole lot of things
shed go herself an take me if it wasnt
for her work paw he dont do nothin
the words poured forth in such a flood
of bitterness that cherry stared aghast
too overcome to reply tightening his
arm about the child he gave her a short
sympathetic squeeze and the two rode on
in silence toward the circle k

  when they reached the ranch-house
cherry led his charge at once into the
presence of kade after he had told her
errand and she had departed with her
bundle of shirts he plunged at once into
his own affairs with the lack of hesita-
tion which he always employed in per-
forming some disagreeable duty ta-
king his letter from the pocket of his
shirt he handed it to his employer

 kade read it slowly while a little wrin-
 kle of annoyance began to form between
 his brows when he had finished he re-
 turned it in the same silence with which
 it had been received

 what outfit he asked finally

  bar circle

 kade gave a grunt of surprise and
 stepping back a pace or two surveyed
 cherry carefully from head to foot as
 though he were taking his measure for the
 first time

 you goin he asked

  yes

 when

  to-morrow mornin

 kade nodded thoughtfully

  all right turner he said  i
 dont blame you youve done well re-
 member if ever you want to come back
 your jobll be waitin for you	

  thanks ill remember

 the matter settled kade turned away
 with his hand upon the door he suddenly
 paused

  how you goin   he asked  youre
 about even with what youve overdrawn

 a look almost sheepish came into
 cherrys eyes and he twisted the brim of
 his stetson in nervous embarrassment

   got a little speculation over in town
 i reckonll do he said finally in a low
 voice

  cattle

  no poker stud

 the line that had come between kades
 brows faded quietly away and his face
 expanded in a smile

 is that so he said cheerfully

  well i reckon you aint gone-yet

iv

 the following morning a crowd gath-
 ered at lopezs saloon that comprised the
 entire male population of kade it be-
 gan arriving a good sixty minutes before
 train time an hour that was definite not-
 withstanding the irregularity of the g
 and i for kade being the first station
 on the return trip the train was usually
 on time

 dorsey arrived promptly at the half-
 hour clothed in the full glory of his store-
 clothes and carrying a-small valise of the
 variety known as  telescope his com-
 ing was attended by so much curiosity
the card on the beam



and excitement that he immediately
dropped his usual attitude of cringing ser-
vility and began to put on airs

after he had taken the seat of honor
at the poker-table and had counted out

  five minutes before train time cherry
arrived dressed also in the garb of a
traveler and accompanied by-a crowd of
his companions who had ridden in for the
double purpose of seeing him off and wit-

 hallo

 the fifty dollars in small bills and change
 he leaned back in his chair with an at-
 tempt at importance

   it dont look like the other gents
 present enough to hurt none he ob-
 served running his eye over the crowd

  the puncher who had been in the game
the day before stepped forward

   does you mean to say you think he
aint coinin   he asked pointedly

   not at all not at all said dor-
sey as he became more unassuming  i
simply mean hes late

  a subdued silence fell upon the crowd

nessing the exposure of the mysterious
card

  notwithstanding their anxious ques-
tioning of the night before cherry had
preserved a tantalizing silence saying
only that if they would come in with him
in the morning they could see for them-
selves the arrival of this delegation
was treated with the deference carefully
exacted by those of the circle k

  cherry entered carrying his saddle over
his shoulder he deposited it on the
floor made a hasty inventory of the
money on the table and turned to dorsey

be



 sis where you goin this
 time of day  


the railroad mans magazine

   sorry im late he said  but i had
to see about my boss im goin away
too

  dorsey smiled magnanimously

   thats all right he replied  it
dont make no difference

   you are ready 

   let her roll

  in the hush that followed this ex-
change of courtesies cherry seized a
chair and planted it firmly beneath the
beam as he did so the sound of a
whistle was borne faintly in upon the
quiet air

  the crowd surged eagerly forward
dorsey squirmed uneasily in his chair

   hurry up he urged  shes mow-
in now

  with his hand on the card cherry
paused disturbed by a sudden commotion
at the back of the narrow room as he
waited a small red figure wormed its way
to the side of dorseys chair and the si-
lence was broken by the sound of a high
childish voice

  come on paw it pleaded you
aint goin ter git left now

  it was mline

  a sudden sickening sensation came
over cherry and he dropped his hand as
quickly as if the card had been a coal of
living fire so the money that he was
about to win was not dorseys it was
his wifes-the pitiful amount which she
had been saving piece by piece from her
earnings that she might enjoy a few of
the necessities of life at christmas

  if he went to the pan handle now he
would be no better than the despicable
creature before him he would be living
upon a womans money 

  from outside came the rattle of the
approaching train and as cherry gazed at
mline the vision of the pan handle
seemed slowly to fade away in its place
came the vision of a doll-a beautiful
doll with yellowhair and eyes and a
sure enough dress and hat that would
come off

  slowly twisting the end of his gaudy

handkerchief as was his habit in moments
of perplexity cherry spoke to dorsey
it was in simple direct language

  dorsey rose angrily and pushed the
child aside

   git outer here he commanded
 im coinin right away

  then he turned impatiently to the quiet
figure upon the chair

   lets have her  he cried peremptor-
ily  i aint got all day

  without a moments hesitation cherry
reached up and tore away the card then
he crumpled it up in his hand and thrust
it into a pocket of his trousers

  with an oath dorsey sprang forward
feeling for his hip only to recoil in terror
at sight of the  which had suddenly-
appeared in cherrys hand the crowd
surged back uneasily leaving the two
alone in the middle of the room

   look here  gasped dorsey white
and trembling  you-all aint goin ter
let me be belt up this-a-way 

  then cherry said slowly and distinct-
ly still covering the cringing figure with
his gun

   its all right dorsey you win i
just dont want you to make no foolish
play thats all now you take the
money and the saddle and hike for the
train or youll get left likewise id ad-
vise you to play your winnins accordin
to the advice of them who staked you if
you dont ill know you neednt wait
for me i reckon i aint goin to-day

  amid the relief that followed this an-
nouncement the crowd surged back again
curious and disappointed anxiously ques-
tioning about the mysterious card

  cherry smiled sheepishly as he put up
his gun and stepped down to the floor

   sho he said  you-all dont none
of you want to see my little old four of
spades next time i want to run a bluff
i reckon ill be more careful who i try it
on

  then he gritted his teeth and went si-
lently out to face the humiliation of his
barebacked return to the circle k

mans wreck record

by sam henry

the true story series it is generally conceded that the

express messenger and the railway mail clerk are in the most dangerous
situation of anybody on a train in case of wreck mr henrys stories
perhaps do not advance anything toward proving this for he has lived to go
through nearly twenty wrecks without receiving an injury that would perma-
nently incapacitate him it is hard to say whether thisproves that he is very
lucky or very unlucky

     true many men fail to survive even one wreck but to have the mis-
fortune to be laid out more or less seriously half a score of times and to be
roughly handled half a score more in twenty-six years is a record that no one
need desire to equal and after all this our friend writes us that he is now
impatiently waiting until his latest wounds are healed that he may once more
go and throw a dice with luck on the railroad

a mail clerk who has averaged almost one wreck in every year
of his railroad career and who is almost ready to
go out on the main line again

heard the awful grinding of two steel

monsters coming together it seemed each

tion and at the same time felt yourself
being hurled through space and a huge
tender telescope your car right where you

i was very busy but noticed that we were
having an unusual amount of smoke

  investigating i found that my car was
in flames

  having no way of signaling i went
to the door and did my best in lung
power but could attract no
attention the fire was get-
ting hot and drove me to the
farthest end of the car where
all hope of rescue left me

  i had visions of being
roasted alive and i began to
lose consciousness dimly i
noticed that we slowed down
at a water-tank fortunately
the rest of the train-crew had
also discovered the fire

  the train stopped the
burning car was cut loose run
under the water-tank and the
water turned  but she was
too far gone to be saved
the engineer broke through
an end of the car and pulled
me out i was overcome by
heat and smoke but after be-
ing revived and the burned
places plastered up i returned
to my work

  about two months later we
were going along at our usual
gait when i wets startled by
a succession of shrill whis-
tles from our engine which
opened up to the last notch
the next instant i could feel
that we were going some-
where where there were 
rails

  when  landed and worked
myself out i opened the door
and found the car flat upon
the ground and off the right-
of-way

some one was screaming help im
killed help 

  following the sound we found the
fireman in the tender from which the
coal had emptied the trucks from the
mail and baggage cars were all twisted
over him but strange to say be had
not received as much as a scratch

  the engine had turned almost around
throwing the engineer into a bank of
sand about fifteen feet away like the
fireman he was not hurt enough to men-

and i believe six times i have been in
the back shops for repair let me re-
late to you now the most startling inci-
dents of the wrecks which i have gone
through in the past twenty-six years

  in the early eighties i was  a road

the engineer broke through an end of
             and pulled me out

in texas which used coal - burners and
the old - time bell - cord for passenger-
trains while the freight-engines burned
wood with no other attachments but the
old link and pin for coupling

  on this occasion our passenger-engine
broke down and we pressed a freight-
engine into service which under heavy
pressure threw out great chunks of fire
as we soon had cause to know

  the through mail was in the end next
to the engine the transoms were open
one mans wreck record



tion in fact no one on the train was se-
verely injured

  this wreck a fearful mix-up resulted
from an old cow steering a course down
the track in a cut right at the end was
a cattle-guard the engineer attempted
to lift the cow before she could reach
the guard but he ran onto her just as
she went into it

drowning among the mail

  not more than a year after this wreck
occurred i was on another road it had
been raining very hard for several days
and the night was as black as pitch

  we were going down a steep grade at
a pretty lively clip right at the bot-
tom was a small creek with the bridge
gone the engines nose went down and
she turned with her back against the op-
posite bank making a pretty good somer-
sault and throwing the engineer

  the car i was in leaped into space and
fell into about four feet of water my
hand was jammed in a sliding-door and
all the mail fell against me so that i
could not move i felt the water creep-
ing up higher and higher until it passed
my waist then i heard some one call
 oh laddie are you dead  i let out a
yell that convinced me that i was not

  the old engineer broke in the door
and rescued me help had not come
any too soon for the creek was coming up
all the time the fireman had jumped
into the water and floated away from the
wreck

  just as the engineer and i reached a
dry place he fainted three of his ribs
were broken and he was a mass of bruis-
es and cuts

  i carry a crooked thumb as the result
of that experience i thought the doctor
would never get through taking splin-
tered bones from it

  the engineer and i were the only ones
hurt and we were off duty a long time

an open switch

  before the split-switch days and about
six months after i had returned to work
we were going at a lively rate being
three hourt late at the beginning of a
sharp curve was the far end of a siding
and a fifteen-foot embankment of sand

   the switch had been left set for the
 siding by a freight and as  switch-
 lights were used we hit this open switch
 at full speed into space we leaped
 the engine rolled over several times and
 it seemed to me that the car i was in
 would never stop

   i was buried under about four thou-
 sand pounds of mail and nearly smoth-
 ered before i was dug out a little water
 in the face however and a drink from a
 bottle that one of the passengers had
 fixed me all right they told it on the
 fireman that he landed almost off the
 right-of-way and the first thing he did
 was to holler to the engineer to bring
 him his new suit of clothes which he had
 just bought that day some of the pas-
 sengers were slightly hurt but none of
 the train crew

head-on collision

   i was not in this wreck but arrived
 about two hours after to take charge of
 uncle sams business through a mis-
 understanding of orders a cattle-train
 tried to make a siding for a passenger-
 train the freight crew of five men all
 on the engine when the two trains met
 was entirely wiped out

    the impact was so great that the mail-
car was driven completely through the
 express-car and the tender telescoped
them both

   when they found the mail clerk and
 express messenger they were together
 mixed up with some oysters

   the mail clerk must have passed
 through two car ends and a partition in
 his car how he got there alive was
 beyond us all all his wearing apparel ex-
 cept his shoes had been torn from him
 but the only injury he received was a
 slight bruise on the arm

    it was rather a frosty night in novem-
 ber  the passengers crowded around and
 were trying to get some clothing on him
 one thought to warm him up so offered
 him some whisky

     i dont drink he said

   when the express messenger was un-
 earthed his hair was all matted with
 oysters a lady standing by shrieked
 loudly

     the poor fellows brains arc oozing
 out and he is still alive  


the railroad mans magazine

   the conductor who had taken us out

 	the relief-train ran a nail nearly
 through his foot while climbing over
 some debris and was unable to wear a
 shoe as day began to break some texas
 steers were seen lying about some dead
 some injured others very ready to dis-
 pute the territory with any- one coming
 their way

   this conductor wandered off some dis-
 tance from the track leaning upon a
 stick one of the steers took ffiffense at
 his intrusion and started for nita he
 dropped his stick and the way he cov-
 ered ground would have done justice to
 a texas bronco he made for an old
 dead tree that i am certain no ordinary
 country boy could have climbed and
 shinning up it there he had to remain
 until mr longhorn chose to move on
 as no one else there felt like disputing
 with the steer

a cyclone in the offing

  along in  i was doing extra
stunts for uncle sam in east texas
on a narrow-gage we burned wood and
whenever we came to a wood-pile pas-
sengers and all would turn out to pitch
wood for a rest

   one evening about sundown we were
pitching wood when  noticed a funnel-
shaped cloud coming right toward us
broadside

   i called the engineers attention to it
 asking him did he not think we had bet-
 ter try to get out into an opening about
 one mile away as we were then in the
 midst of long pine-trees and would be in
 danger of their blowing across our
 coaches

   we all jumped aboard and our engi-
neer pulled out with full pressure we
had gone about one-half of a mile when
the hurricane struck us and we began
spilling all over the right-of-way we
had run into a very large tree

   after everything had settled down the
 express messenger came through the
 creep-hole into my end he embraced me
 and began to lament  what will my
 wife do with six orphaned children
 here i am killed and they are without
 support oh my heaven this is awful
 have mercy on them

   i tried in every way to quiet him and

 finally succeeded the surprise when he
 found that he did not have a scratch was
 almost as bad as the thought that he was
 dead lie told me that he actually be-
 lieved he had been killed

  afterward we started to jolly him
about it but soon stopped a ghastly
look would come over his face and he
would say so earnestly

   boys dont do that if you only
knew my suffering you would help me try
to forget that wreck

  the engineer and fireman were
scratched up somewhat and  had the
last finger of my left hand broken

hit a broken rail

  about a year after i was back on
a standard-gage every morning before
our train left the terminal  dock a
young fellow working with me would
read aloud the most sugar-coated love-
letters that i have ever heard his girls
safety-valve was smashed all to pieces
and she had one continuous flow of sweet
steam

  she was awfully anxious for him to
quit the road  because honey boy i
am so afraid you may get hurt was the
wind-up of every letter

  one day a train came in and reported
a bad place five miles out on a very
sharp curve the operator overlooked
serving us with a notice in regard to this
before we pulled out

  we hit the curve the engine passed
over all right but the rest of the train
began to double up our engineer opened
up and straightened it out

  the car we were in rolled over on the
side but we were not hurt so i said to
 dock   lets get busy now and have
everything ready to transfer to the other
train which the conductor tells me they
will make up and send out

   dock paying no attention to me
began to take off his overalls put on his
best togs turned over to me everything
belonging to uncle sam picked up his
little grip and walked off never so much
as saying good-by

  ten minutes later i looked out and
saw him taking a short cut across the
prairie toward the place where his girl
lived some twenty miles away i never
saw him again but the next day i read
one mans wreck record



in the paper that he and his  honey
as he called her had coupled up for life

the expired accident policy

just before leaving the terminal an
accident insurance-agent came to my car
inquired if i knew that my policy would

mix-ups but nothing worth mentioning
one night we left our terminal forty-
five minutes late with a crowded train
of eight cars

  our engineer we called  old hot
stuff because of the fast work he got
out of his engine on this occasion our
train was already on a very fast schedule

the mail clerk must have passed through two car ends
and a partition

run out that night at twelve oclock and
tried to persuade me to sign another then
and there i told him that i would call
and renew it as soon as i returned

  exactly forty minutes after my policy
expired a big bohemian a giant in
strength rolled up his mail-sacks tightly
and as we pulled in delivered them into
the car with such force that he broke my
leg and caused me to be laid up for four
months

a head-on collision

  after this unfortunate incident and
up to  i had been in several little

so when he told us that he was going
to his regular meeting-point about eighty-
five miles away where we took the siding
for the finest and heaviest train that ran
across texas and that we had the right
of track against all other trains we knew
that we were going to do some fast
riding

  at our first stop forty miles out the
despatcher gave us -five minutes help
against the fine train but we were to take
the siding as usual when a train tajyes
the siding and is in the clear the head-
light is covered

  we were at the whistling-post one
mile away  old hot stuff  signaled


the railroad mans magazine

for the station and at the same time shut
off seeing the light of the other train
disappear at that moment and also a
light swinging alongside of the track he
naturally thought the fine train had
taken the siding

  as a matter of fact this train had

landed on a pile of mail we had an
express-car ahead of us and our car
went through this until it met the ten-
der

  the fact that puzzled every one was
no one was hurt on our train no one in
the coaches on the front part of the fine

stopped and her headlight flipped out
and the light which he had seen by the
track had been made by the conductor
walking alongside of his train toward
the head-end slightly swinging his lamp
as he walked

   old hot stuff  gave a little toot-
toot and opened her wide we were
already going rather fast but we seemed
then to gain by leaps and bounds the
next instant our engine gave the most
fearful shriek the air went on to the
emergency and we crashed into the fine
train head-on at a speed of over fifty-
miles an hour

  i never heard such hissing of esca-
ping steam the impact was so great that
we knocked the other train of eleven cars
back three car-lengths i was hurled
through space over twenty feet and

train but almost every one in the hind
sleeper-one so badly that it is said he
will be a cripple for life

  while my partner and i were taking
stock of our bruises an enterprising law-
yer who was a passenger came to our
car-door and tried to convince me that i
was badly hurt he was very persistent
and asked me to come out with him to
see what a fearful wreck it was

  we started ahead walking along the
side track but being blinded by com-
ing out of the light we plunged into an
open cattle-guard about four feet deep
and i came near biting my tongue off
mr attorney saw that i was bleeding
and he went on at a terrible rate stating
that he would get me ten thousand dol-
lars for my fearful injuries

  i could not stop his steam as we ap-
one mans wreck record



praached a crowd of people he called out
to them  heres one of the boys who
was in the telescoped car see the blood
coming from his mouth he is bleeding
to death internally

  the crowd gathered about me but i
broke and ran got back to my car and
shut the doors mr attorney did not
get my case and i never attempted to
collect one cent from the railroad com-
pany but kept right on at work

  whether the lawyer thought i was in-
ternally hurt or not i cannot say though
i believe he had a right to think so be-
cause excitement at times nauseates me
as it did on this occasion and i was hold-
ing myself as if hurt his flow of talk
was so fast however that i could not
stop him to explain this 

expressmans desperate dive

  three years ago as we were pulling
out of our terminal on the finest train
that crosses from the atlantic to the
pacific my partner asked me how late we
were leaving and i replied  eight
minutes but our schedule is very fast
and we have louie in the cab with one
of the fastest engines on the road we
will not be behind very long

  we were soon straining trying to
make our work keep pace with the tattoo
louie had notched his engine to i took
the time as we passed the blind siding
and i could see that we were picking
up right along

  as we approached our first telegraph-
station fourteen miles out we were fair-
ly skipping away louie called for a
clear board called again and again then
shut down to stop about that time the
operator heard his call and cleared in-
stantly louie opened up full

   fust after passing the small depot bal-
last began to fly and our car to sway and
jump i was thrown into some iron
racks and my left arm was pinned among
them my partner caught me tightly
about the waist and as the car turned
first to one side and then to the other
the weight of both of us was hanging
by that one arm

  after tearing along for about three
hundred feet we hit a water-tank on
heavy iron girders tearing two of them
away the force of the collision turned

our car completely around and left it
sitting flat upon the ground

  when i got loose it was found that
the muscles in my back were strained
and my arm badly wrenched

   the express messenger had a terrible
experience-his car turned over in a
deep lake and in some way a large hole
was knocked in the side the trunks
and express piled on and about him pin-
ning him down

   his foot happened to go through the
hole into the water he let the other
through and found that he could pass
his body down and under the car so with
a short dive and a few splashes he was
on dry land but such a sight

   he seemed to be bleeding all over and
 his back resembled a hacked beefsteak
 we got him into our car cut off what
 few remaining rags he had on and
 wrapped him in a blanket we looked
 for the engine but could not see it

   after a while when louie came up to
the door with blood pouring from un-
der his cap we thought it was his ghost
he told us that the engine was fifty feet
- from the track behind some willows
standing on her nose

   several people had been killed in the
 negro coach and others badly hurt the
 express-boy louie the fireman my part-
 ner and myself were trying to take care
 of ourselves in the mail-car while we
 were taking an inventory of our injuries
 a large fine-looking fellow stuck ihis
 head in the door and beheld a sight
 which he said resembled a slaughter-
 house  boys he said  if there is
 anything on earth i can do to relieve
 your sufferings speak quick

   i told him if we had a little whisky
and some sheets which he could get in
the pullman i believed that we could
manage until a relief-train reachal us

  he went back into the pullman and
at first they refused to let him have what
he wished but i was told he addressed
his second request with such force show-
ing a face behind it that would not stand
for hesitation that it was but a few min-
utes until we had plenty of sheets and
it seemed twenty bottles of about twenty
different kinds of whisky he demanded
to know what it was all worth  i wont
let these boys sponge on any one espe-
cially short guys like you


the railroad maxs magazine

  the conductor who had been detained
rescuing the dead and wounded came up
heard this remark and assured him that
it was all right the railroad company
would stand for nothing but the best for
us bovs and the refusal to supply us with

  he spit it out  sam you old hoo-
doo turn her up i want a drink  the
seriousness of the situation could not re-
strain a laugh from the others

  the passengers came down our way
and a man and his wife approached he

delivered them into my car with such force that
he broke my leg

sheets had evidently been caused by ex-
citement

  our friend was certainly a prince of
good fellows he stayed with us and
saw that we had every attention possible

  he asked ine if i were not a texan
and i told him that he had given me the
proper sign

  we never thought of giving the express-
boy a drink as he seemed too far gone
but he soon rolled up his eyes and asked
to have his head raised a little saying
to me

   pass those bottles under my nose un-
til i find the right one-that one now
turn it to my mouth i barely tipped
the bottle

was pleading with her not to get excited
 my dear do calm yourself it is all
right

  she was as cool as a refrigerator full
of ice but he was shaking as though he
had the louisiana  swamp ague and
was as white as a sheet the cause of
this wreck was never determined i was
in the  back shops  for repair about
one month this time

within ten minutes of safety

  at the time of writing this i am again
in the  back shops when the wreck
which was responsible for this occurred
we were within ten minutes of our ter-
one mans wreck record



minal clipping away at forty miles per
hour i had just remarked to one of my
partners  we will soon be home meet
me in the park late this evening and
well have a talk over our pipes

  the words had scarcely left my lips
when ballast began to fly our car lunged
then pitched and rolled over from the
top of the car when standing on the track
to the spot where it hit was thirty feet

  i was holding to the rods on the side
from which the car was turning when
it hit it jerked my hold loose throwing
me with great force nine feet and land-
ing me upon iron racks and ribs of the
car a wheel of the -tender had burst

  when the doctor marked on a skeleton
the places where i was injured there
were some twenty-two contusions from
my foot to my head on the right side
back bruised and three lumps on the
muscles of the leg and arm which still
show knee wrenched and still swollen

  i have been in the  shops  for eight
weeks now with-two fine mechanics try-
ing to get me on the track again and an
occasional consultation from even higher
authority after all that i have been
through my nerves are as steady to-day

patents and

the united states patent office issued
last year  patents reissued 
patents and registered  trade-marks la-
bels and prints during that time 
patents expired the expenses of the office
for the year were  and the receipts
 last years balancer together
with that of former years leaves to the cred-
it of the office in the united states treasury
 special attention is now being-
given to the classification of the 
united states patents to the  for-
eign patents and to the  volumes in the
library when this work is accomplished it
is expected that the expense of examining
applications will be reduced by one-third
and the character of the work improved

  the present method of operating the pat-
ent office imposes an unnecessary tax upon
inventors for which there is no excuse
with all the surplus income derived from
patentees the office is entirely inadequate for
the business and its inconvenience has been
complained of for years but congress has
always turned a deaf ear to complaints

as they ever were and if the doctors
would tell me that it would not inter-
fere with a permanent cure  should not
mind the pain i at times still suffer and
would be right in the thick of the fight

  i am always happy when i can feel
the wheels under me clipping along at
fifty to sixty miles per hour and hear
our powerful steel horse as if breathing
heavily in an attempt to win the race
we are on i am spurred on to fastest
work when the engine settles down to a
perfect tattoo and i feel the wheels un-
der me clipping off a rhythmical accom-
paniment i cannot leave the life al-
though i have had splendid offers to do so

  in conclusion i would speak a word
to those who are always ready to sue the
railroad companies for damages the
men at the head of these companies are
human with all my mishaps i have
never had to collect one cent from a rail-
road company through the courts nor
with the assistance of an attorney

  whenever i am really hurt i go to
them with a straightforward statement
of the facts and in every case receive
a satisfactory and immediate settlement
try it yourself next time and see

their cost

  in the course of its progress through the
office up to the issue and mailing of a patent
an application passes through the hands of
fifty-two persons

  an applicant pays  to have his claim
examined and in case he is granted a
patent an additional fee of  is required

  attorneys charge from  up according
to the work demanded by the cases and as
the applications number about  yearly
it will be seen that there is a good deal of
money to be divided among the patent law-
yers whose signs cover the faces of the build-
ings in the vicinity of the patent office

  an inventor is not required to employ an
attorney but probably ninety-nine out of a
hundred do in simple cases where there is
no interference with prior claims an inven-
tor can almost as well deal direct with the
government but in most cases the knowl-
edge of the lawyer is valuable

 he can study other inventions in the
same line and knows how to make the claim
broad enough to cover all that is new and
valuable and not so broad as to be rejected

man and his son

by herman da costa

no -there are several earthquakes

jim finds that he has  made good so he writes pop the news
and the old man comes back with something to
reduce a swelled dome

lot about it-mostly guesswork the
truth of the matter is this the traffic
vice-president and the general managers
office had been on the outs for a long
while because the v-ps office wanted to
run the general manager who thought the
operating end of the line was it

  earthquake no -im getting  a
month now last salary was  by-
special arrangement-a clear increase of
 a month

  but let me explain how it all happened
you remember i told you about having
trouble with grand t fs new secre-
tary it seems grand got sore when they
took him out of the presidents office and
sent him to t f

  lie didnt pay much attention to his
work and got himself pretty well dis-
liked because he tried to boss everybody
then when you sent me those wires and
i was on the point of quitting on account
of grand he had a scrap with t f
sassed him all over the place and ended
by resigning

  they took in another man from the
presidents office that made me hop-
ping mad because i avas entitled to it by-
right the new man was a good one
though to fill his place in the presi-
dents office they shifted around the men
leaving a position of assistant chief clerk
open and promoted the superintendents

jim to the old man

         ar dad talk about
things happening in the
last week so many earth-
quakes have hit the office
that we dont pay any at-
tention any more to such
small things as wrecks but i say  we 
when i shouldnt thats earthquake
no 

  im not in the general managers office
any more dad you couldnt guess in
five thousand years whats happened ill
relieve your suspense im now chief
clerk to the superintendent of the balti-
more division

  hows that going some i guess
isnt it great i sign all the official mail
in his name with a big  britt  under-
neath it

  honestly when i first started in i
hated to stop signing the letters it
looked so nice to be able to give out
instructions yourself and sign besides
great well i should say yes its fine
ive been living on the hilltops for the
last two weeks

  earthquake no -t f tom fitz-
gerald-your tom fitzgerald-has quit
the b and d thats some of an earth-
quake isnt it he had been with the
road so long that it seemed as if something
was wrong with it the papers had a
letters of an old railroad man and his son 

    on the very day that i was going to
  tell connolly i intended to quit t f
  called me in the office charlie gallo-
  way the superintendent was with him 
  had always liked galloway and we knew
  each other pretty well

     that is the man said t f then
  he turned to me

     mr galloway has got a place open
  in his office as chief clerk britt would
  you like to take it 

    would i i stammered out some-
  thing i dont know what it was for i
  was knocked sillv

    well saidt f you report to
  him monday

    i shook hands with t f twice and
  with galloway three or four times-i am
  not sure which-before i finally located
  the door then  walked out at peace
  with the world

     i couldnt do much the rest of the day
  and connolly understood how  felt for
  he kept on smiling all the time he was
  the one who had suggested my name to
  t f i afterward learned and galloway
  said i would do as all he wanted was
  some one wtfo wouldtake the detail work
  off his shoulders and keep things running
  smoothly

     i had a hard time of it the first week
  worked till ten at night but it didnt
  count for i had some responsibility of
  my own at last

    i dont know where t f has gone i
  hear he is running a little coal road in
  west virginia but wherever he goes ill
  bet you hell take my best wishes along
  with him never have i met a finer man
  for handling people than he never have
  i met a more courteous and big-hearted
  -- man

    but those who know him love him too
 much to be able to sing his praises-they
  can just jump the fellow who slings mud
 at him-and let it go at that

     i like my new work immensely theres
  lots of it and close to the rails too im
  beginning to get virtuously indignant
  now when the other offices ask us to
  explain delays to passenger and fast
  freights particularly when  know that
  the majority of them are written by some
  sap-headed general managers clerk or
  some one in the traffic department

    those fellows dont know the differ-

	ence between a box car and a cattle-car

      	r r

and just want your explanation in order
to file it away regardless of whether its
good or bad

  im beginning to get the underground
method of work too such a little thing
for instance as losing correspondence that
might be hard to answer satisfactorily
ive got a stenographer of my own dont
laugh

  my one trouble is with the boys in the
office naturally they didnt like to see
an outsider put over their heads and they
dont object to showing their dislike a
little bit

  i am trying to be patient though and
hope the friction will wear away if
youve got any of that celebrated medici-
nal advice of yours handy-in capsule
form-on handling this bunch send it
along

  mr galloway is nice with me and his
secretary has put me straight once or
twice although i wouldnt admit i- to
him for he would promptly telhthe others
should they ever begin criticizing me
you know how easy it is for some one to
volunteer stuff like that when everybody

  good executive ability-the ability to

ing just for the love of it-that and
keeping expenses down will make a man
head of the road in no time and a man
with executive ability has got to have tact
and diplomacy

  while were talking about diplomacy
let me tell you about henry powers
hen when i first met him was office-boy
in the superintendents office hen was a
red-headed freckle-faced kid of about
fourteen with a grin that used to spread
from the end of one ear to the other  and
on special occasions the corners used to
meet at the back of his head

  no matter how much the whole office
felt like jumping in the river henry was
always there with his little smile it was
born of good digestion and a miraculous
appetite if you spoke to him it grew a
little and if you cussed him it became a
yard wide

  you couldnt persuade him you meant
it hed try to convince you you were
joking and if you insisted you werent
hed make you believe you were mistaken
and the way he could make the other
office-boys hustle around was a caution

  he was a confidential kid too lean
over your desk and tell you things with
an air of great secrecy and call you
mister just when you were longing for
somebody with appreciation enough to
stick a title before your name instead of
saying  here you  

  ask him to go off on an errand just
when he came off a hard trip and his
 yes sir would come back at you as
cheerfully as if it was a fishing excursion
and you were paying for the tickets and
bought the bait

  but you couldnt impose on him no
siree i remember one day i came in the
office when seebald the stenographer
was trying to make him go out and buy
some cigarettes when i say cigarettes
youll know seebald

  i came in the door just when hen was
using his brand of diplomacy seebald
was blue in the face and shaking an arm
that looked like a pipe-stem under hens
nose

   no sir grinned hen  i aint going

to get no cigarettes  aint got time
but i tell you what ill do-ill ask the
boss to let me get em for you

  before seebald could stop him hen
was inside the superintendents office ex-
plaining that the stenographer wanted
him to buy some cigarettes and would
mr martin mind letting him go

  he wasnt very busy as he only had
about two hundred letters to fix up for
mailing and about forty to deliver around
the building besides sorting the corre-
spondence and attending to his regular
work

  before he was half-way through mar-
tin was standing in the outside office read-
ing the law to seebald while hen was
standing in the doorway with an inno-
cent expression on his face as if he
couldnt see why his friend seebald should
get called down and hen took particu-
lar pains to explain to seebald that it was
an outrage and hed get em anyhow if
he said so the kid was young and used
science against brute strength

  hen speedily got popular on account
of his cheerfulness he was naturally
bright too and picked up a lot of office-
work one day the general superintend-
ent telephoned down to martin about
something that had gone wrong i think
it was an important letter sent astray

  martin and the chief clerk put hen
over the coals finally they had him
pinned down good and hard at every
harsh question they put he would answer
and give one of those cordial grins-and
under the influence of those grins tilings
didnt look half so serious as when they
first started

  martin had to relieve his feelings
somehow though so he began to cuss
hen doing him up artistically and
hen just stood there taking it all in
and smiling back at martin for all the
world as if he was saying in the most
respectful kind of a way

   thats all right mr martin youre
too fine a man to mean all that i know
you better than that  matter what you
say until martin gave in

  he turned to his chief clerk and heaved
a sigh

    its useless to talk to that little runt
he said  everything i say he just
stands there and grins as if he like it
he wheeled suddenly on henry
letters of an old railroad man and his son 

   get out of here   he bellowed and
henry got

  outside henry was explaining to his
admirers

  didnt he fire you he was asked

   fire me  grinned henry derisively
not  your life hes going to raise
my salary five dollars

  do you know where that red-head is
now your remark about t f losing
out in the fight with the traffic vice-pres-
ident brought it all back to me that
kid worked his way up in the road and
to-day is now one of the smoothest and
most diplomatic traffic men in the united
states

  hes the same traffic vice-president
with whom t f had die fight there
isnt a man in traffic circles in the country
who doesnt know him  for lies as popu-
lar there and in the big business world as
t f is in the operating department
you can tell him a mile off by his smile

  the way to handle men jim is to
leave them alone every man alive has
his own little particular way of looking
at his work men who fill big positions
have got to be different to the ordinary
man they must forget that they ever
had feelings they mustnt get excited
and they cant afford to lose their tem-

the

 pers the men working for the boss
 look on him as different

   in a well-organized business the boss
 is really a kind of father with his em-
 ployees as the family they look to him
 in time of trouble and if hes a big-main
 they soon lean on- him

   when he must call a man down he
 does it quickly and forgets about it

   the man who realizes that he must for-
 get his own feelings no matter how low
 down on the ladder he is will hold the
 bosss job some day hes just the kind
 of a man the world wants to run its busi-
 ness he doesnt need stand on die
 house-top and yell to the fellow on the
 street that he is the real goods his ac-
 tions will yell for him louder and carry
 farther than ever he can

   forget yourself say that over a doz-
 en times a day jim and youll be the
 man for the place

   its a wise man who knows he isnt out
 of short trousers yet

   its one eternal fight to keep the other
 kids from making you forget youre a
 kid too

   face the music smile and be honest
 if you do those things youll have the
 satisfaction of knowing youve won

your affectionate father

novel scheme on the erie

the erie railroad has given over one
car in some of its suburban trains to
the commuters who object to the steam
heat and stuffy atmosphere of the regular
cars the cars carry signs reading  fresh
air and are started out from the terminals
with the doors ventilators and alternate
side windows wide open any person riding
in these cars is privileged to close the win-
dow next to him but has no right to insist

on the closure of other ventilation openings
the will of the majority of those who ride
in the cars will control the turning on of
the steam-heat which may be wanted in very
cold weather those who find the cars too
cold can always move to other cars in the
trains

  this is a novel- but sensible way of
solving the vexatious problem of heating
and ventilating cars in winter

upsetting old baggage theory

a case of interest to railroads as well
as travelers has been decided in phila-
delphia the jury rendering a verdict against
the pennsylvania for the full value of bag-
gage lost in a io-cent package-room at one
of its stations in new york the company
contended the package-rooms were main-
tained for the accommodation of passengers

only and the small cost charged did not im-
pose upon it any obligation beyond ten
dollars

  the judge said the company had assumed
the safe-keeping of the baggage and he
therefore permitted the case to go to the jury
which rendered a verdict of  the
company will appeal

by j l james

          the trials and tribulations encountered
          while waiting for  the great unlimited

as sitting in the stuffy little
depot of a prairie town a
norther was prowling
around outside and whistling
mournfully about the eaves
a lone drummer two or three
farmers and myself were waiting for
tiie local going west a swaying combina-
tion of one rickety passenger-coach any
number of freight-cars and a sputtering
little hog-back engine

  the train made daily trips but on
its return each afternoon or midnight
became no  instead of no -its west-
bound cognomen

  the road boasted of another train
subject also to daily change of num-
bers-no  and no -a real passen-
ger-train due late in the afternoon and
likely to arrive at any time thereafter

  on this particular morning no 
known by the boys as  the great un-
limited was also late no one was
surprised the drummer who had
worked the whole town since breakfast
and had then defeated all the local
checker champions was trying to kill
time by dozing in a corner or slapping
at some stray fly

  i had kept awake watching his antics
for a while then discovered a dirt-daub-
ers nest on a horseshoe over a door and
for an hour or so divided time between
wondering how that individual discov-
ered that a horseshoe brought good luck
and listening to the progress of a domino
game in the office between the agent and
the only drayman in town

  suddenly the outer door opened with
a crash a man a woman and several
children entered showing by all signs in
sight or hearing that they were emi-
grants or as locally termed  movers

  the woman was carrying in one hand
an old umbrella a frying-pan and a
bird-cage with ajralf-grown rabbit in
it in the other hand she had a hat-box
under one arm was a square box-like
old clock and from her wrist hung a bag
that bulged with a conglomeration of
articles

  behind the woman came a girl of
perhaps eight years carrying another
clock of different shape and an anxious-
looking gray cat that seemed to have its
attention divided between fear of falling
and the desire to eat the rabbit

  the man carried nothing but a big
fat bawling baby of two years wrapped
up in a red and green blanket other
children followed some carrying various
articles some crying others eating pea-
nuts

  the children all came into the depot
readily enough but seemed to have no
further idea what was expected of them
and stood gazing at the lurid posters
maps and excursion notices or stumbled
over seats and suit-cases

  now set down commanded the
mother  and dont stand around gapin
like a lot o eegiots 

  the youthful movers broke ranks
some to clamber into seats others to go
on a tour of inspection of everything
within range the mother pushed one
clock under a seat found a lamp-bracket
for the bird-cage and sat down with the
baby and the other clock in her lap hav-
ing deposited the bag on the seat beside
her

  then the clock under the seat began
to strike lustily as it finished the thirty-
seventh stroke the alarm in the clock in
her lap went off with such a bang that
the baby took fright and fell off its
moving the movers



 mothers lap onto the floor with fresh
 yells of terror

   i stole a look over the top of my mag-
 azine behind which i had been trying
 to screen myself and vainly tried to
 catch thedrummers eye but he vvas ga-
 zing out of the window pinching himself
 to keep from disturbing the peace

   the baby in falling landed some-
 where near the middle of the catch-all
 bag and the mother made a plunge for
 it as if the child were on fire then the
 clock in her lap began striking some un-
 known hour

   now elviry she shrieked there
 youve went and done it i bet you
 broke yo paws mushtash-cup at he got
 at the christmas tree last year

   the proud owner of the mustache-
 cup was standing by the ticket-window
 vaguely wondering when the  depot-
 man  would catch up with his business
 sufficiently to sell a ticket but that per-
 son was just then in the act of defeating
 the drayman at dominoes

   rather than lose the victory he would
 have played on obliviously till no 
 came over the hill had not affairs in the
 waiting-room taken another turn

   the guardian of the household effects
 had just rearranged the baby the bag
 and the clock when her wandering gaze
 missed her first-born a shock-headed boy
  who had not remained in the waiting-
 room long after the arrival of the family

   the baby was at once deposited upon
 the floor where it bellowed wrathfully
 the panic-stricken woman sped for the
 door jerked it open and set up a shrill
 bus-s-ter you b-u-s-t-e-r bus-
 ter-r-r-r  winding up with an ear-split-
 ting whoop

   the wind made straight in at the door
 for the papers on the agents neglected
 desk the freight-bills flew over the
 office and disturbed the checker game
 long enough for the agent to interfere
 with the remark  here ill bust you 
 then as he leaned out of the ticket-
 window far enough to see that the
 offender was a woman his chivalry got
 the better of him and he toned down a
 bit saying  madam if you dont shut
 that door i wont have a paper in the
 house and they will be suing me for
 scaring all the horses out of town or
 chokin up the brazos river

  the woman yelled on obliviously for
some time then muttering  i bet he
gets left by that train closed the door
and started up the platform in search of
the prodigal 

  tilings were getting so interesting
that the drummer passed me the wink
and slunk out of the other door i fol-
lowed

   you go one way said he  and ill
go the other

  we wanted to see the old hen when
she lit and we did out at the farther
end of the platform we turned opposite
corners just as she sailed down on her
runaway

  he had a cotton-hoe by the handle
and to its neck with a card two yards
long he had tied a flop-eared half-breed
dog he was sitt-ing on the platform
holding the hob-handle and dog in fish-
ing style as if he had a bite

   buster  yelled the approaching as-
sailant  wha chu mean runnin off
an the train about to start  

   why maw drawled the boy  the
train aint come yet and paw made me
leave old tige out here while we went
to the depot an hes cold

   well i guess youll warm him up
holdin him here by the handle ill kill
that fool dog  she stormed but aimed
a blow at the boys head he dodged
readily and still clung to the hoe-handle
while the whining dog huddled against
the platform with his tail safely between
his legs

  just then the hog-back squealed in the
distance and the warlike mother set off
to gather her belongings preparatory to
boarding the train

  she took down the bird-cage got an
ann about one clock seized the umbrella
and bag again gave vociferous com-
mands to the children to  git them
things and git on that train and mar-
shaled them in a long line by the track
while no  came clattering in

  most of the passengers were in no hur-
ry to get aboard as no  usually stopped
an hour or two-long enough for a
drummer to  work  the town and catch
the same train for the next

  but to-day those aboard had been
there so long they were anxious to get
off and soon the family phalanx was
broken up by the crowd after the drum-
the railroad mans magazine



mer and i had secured seats we looked
out and saw the woman with the clock
and caged rabbit racing up and down
the platform calling at every jump
 jerri-mi-a-aah-hh 

  as this was a new name we soon fig-
ured that the husband had escaped while
she had been looking for the missing
buster the drayman emerged and out
of pure good-will began to call jere-
miah also several boys took up the
cry till the town rang with the chorus
of shouts for that namesake of the weep-
ing prophet

  finally the woman collected her
children clocks rabbit etc in a knot
near the train and gave out in stentorian
tones that she would  stay right there
till the cows or jerry came home

   im betting on the cows in that
race remarked the drummer and then
he settled for an hours doze before the
train started

  after a while we were all awakened
by a jerk of the train and the renewed
cries of the moving woman who seemed
to think the cows were about to win

  jeremiah had not yet appeared and
the engine had finished its switching
work and backed up to get the train for
another start

  several of the children added to the
hubbub with their frantic yells for
father and just as the bell began ring-
ing for the departure of no  the miss-
ing hero came around the corner of the
depot scowling furiously at the uproar-
ious family

   cant a feller git away long enough
to have a smoke in peace he growled
referring to the two-for-a-nickel cigar
protruding from his overgrown beard
he went into the depot again for the
tickets but the snorting little hog-back
began grunting off down the track leav-
ing the moving-w-oman the picture of
wrath and despair as she clung to her
clocks and rabbit groaning

   i knowed it i knowed it i knowed
hed git left 

  a new disturbance at the rear of the
train now attracted our attention on
investigation we found buster the dog
and the hoe mixed up in a row with
the brakeman the boy and the dog had
slipped on to the rear of the train while
others of the family were calling jerry

   i tell you bub declared the brake-
man  you cant bring that pup on this
car 

  well hes on here aint he re-
torted buster

   well take him to the baggage-car
and express him through he cant stay-
on this car  wheres your ticket  

   paws got it i reckon

   where is he hunt him up quick 
the boy tried to leave the dog in the
corner by the stove while he went to
show the brakeman the holder of the
tjckct but the trick failed the dog
followed and when assaulted by the
brakeman started howling down the
aisle with the hoe catching in the seats
and hitting the passengers

  boy and brakeman tried to stop the
fugitive they caught him at the door
just as a passenger who had been out on
the platform started to enter and had
dodged back in time to let the dog out
the hoe caught in the door-

  just then the train lurched into a stop
at the water-tank dog boy brakeman
and passenger finally untangled them-
selves and buster still holding to the
lioe-handle remarked  i guess my paw
aint on here

   well i guess not snorted the
brakeman rubbing his shins  and bub
next time you try to take a ride bring -
your dad along instead of that pup and
get a ticket too

   huh replied buster as he alight-
ed with his dog and took up his march
back to town  i beat my paw this time
must think i never have moved before

     the rogers group no         
the roundhouse                         
    foreman                           
    by robert h rogers               
when one reviews the work of the roundhouse foreman its minute
details and its broad responsibilities it seems impossible that one
human being can attend to all these multifarious matters and retain
his reason the roundhouse foreman is the man who does not figure
heroically in popular fiction he is not supposed to have an eagle eye or any
of the equipments of a herobut if his eye makes a small mistake in estimating
the extent of repairs necessary the end may well be appalling disaster

    there is no instance where a roundhouse foreman has made such a
mistake and there are hundreds of opportunities almost every day mr
rogers shows that the large responsibilities that some of our great chiefs of
motive power are called upon to bear have been prepared for in the hardest
school of training that lies in the path of any railroad position

what the begrimed and worried-looking man about the roundhouse
is the load he carries and the reward
he hopes to gain

regarding for the
sake of this illustration
and with no disrespect the
large administrative ability
properly conceded to every
division superintendent the
all-important duties of the division engi-
neer and the undoubted skill and energy
of the far-seeing master mechanic-do
you know that there still remains obscured
by all these a lesser official unidentified
with romance and removed from the
spotlight of popular appreciation about
whom nevertheless revolves the actual
began in the april railroad mans

movement of each division on a great
railroad

  does it not seem incompatible in the
methods of up-to-date railroading that if
this one-hundred-dollar boss should sud-
denly drop out an organization supposed-
ly competent to cope with any emergency
would for a time at least become hope-
lessly complicated if these statements
are not too broad and they are in reality
conservative he deserves a place in cer-
tainly not the least interesting chapter

ment

the railroad mans magazine

  it was concerning the importance to the
supervision of this particular member that
e t white mechanical superintendent
of the baltimore and ohio once re-
marked to the writer

   it is easier for me to select seven good
men for the position of master mechanic
whom i know will make good than to
land one good roundhouse foreman

  incumbents of these big jobs do not
speak inadvisedly and not in this instance
at all events because white has made or
named many roundhouse foremen and
many master mechanics probably he has
been the good samaritan to more aspiring
young men than any other man in high
official position and he ought to know

  there is no grade in railroad service
calling for more detail knowledge of a
locomotive and how and-when to apply
it than a roundhouse foreman must pos-
sess under all circumstances he has to
be patient cheerful self-reliant optimis-
tic and resourceful to have even a remote
chance of success and above all his
shoulders must be broad enough to carry
everybodys burdens whether representa-
tives of the shop or road

  his job is the buffer between the shop-
men and the master mechanic and be-
tween the engineers and firemen and the
road foreman of engines he is master
of the situation in a way and in another
way it masters him as in the large ter-
minal the wealth of detail which con-
fronts him is staggering

the man of details

  the superintendent division engineer
and master mechanic are charged with
bringing about broad results on their
division they are largely removed from
vexatious and wearisome small matters
but the roundhouse foreman stands alone
on the firing-line next to the very heart
of things

  it is to him that they flock when the
turntable breaks down when the last of
the inch-nuts are disbursed by the store-
keeper or when a headlight chimney is
wanted for engine   and while these
problems are being intuitively disposed of
the shop water-line will give out with
two or three locomotives attached to it
whose boilers need to be washed before
quitting time there is also a probability

that the engine despatcher will appear
and breathlessly demand another engine
to replace one which is in trouble at the
depot and which its engineer has im-
politely and emphatically  turned in 
over the phone

   these are merely incidents of the daily-
routine the writer has confronted them
all in the short space of fifteen minutes
and with the cheering intimation to boot
that the coal-shed was on fire a fellow
comes to look for the unexpected in this
stirring job  to enjoy it almost and he
is out of place if he doesnt have a prompt
remedy up his sleeve

  it is the conceded receiving end for
trouble and george reynolds for a long
time boss of the connellsville round-
house put it truthfully when he said

   anybody i see walking toward me
 dont care who it is-fireman engineer
boilermaker despatcher call-boy or the
 old man -i know it is trouble coming
in some form or other

faults must be reported

   it is not the fault of the conscientious
machinist if his emery becomes used up
in the middle of a job and no grit can
be scraped together with which to finish
grinding the steam-pipe joints nor is it
against the fireman if the harassed tool-
boy cant find a scoop for him their
idea and a proper one too is to report
these things as soon as they happen thus
relieving their own responsibility because
if delay should result therefrom to job
or train the first question asked by the
master mechanic would be  did you
say anything to anybody about this

   there is no one to say it to but the fore-
man so they wait complacently and it
must be said often with a cheerful grin
while he indicates a way out the fore-
man may dig for one of his own dimes
and chase an apprentice to a hardware-
store down the street for ten cents worth
of emery and he may tell the fireman to
take a shovel from some other engine in
the house which is going to lay over for
a while at all events he will do some-
thing and the situation will clear

  the old man wont know anything
about these trivialities either no fore-
man especially one of the old school
would ever be guilty of continually run-
the roundhouse foreman



ning to the master mechanic with his
troubles if he did start to run the
master mechanic would view it unkindly

  he had to dig his own way out when
in a similar job and unless animated on
exceptional lines he would not care to
run the roundhouse as well as the various
personal duties pertaining to his position
which in itself is far from being a sine-
cure

  the writer was roundhouse foreman
under j b michael at knoxville ten-
nessee  the southern railway for
about a year and only three times in
twelve months he climbed the steps of the
master mechanics office unless lie had
been sent for it is much more pleasant
all around to handle the job without in-
terference and  j b m with his long
experience was sufficiently broad gage to
concede this-provided of course that
the looked-for results were forthcoming

too small for his job

  other reminiscences however are not
so pleasantly recalled-one in particular
where the master mechanic lived in the
roundhouse he was an extreme enthu-
siast but to no purpose

  he threw away valuable time in push-
ing the turntable throwing switches in
the shop-yard and even in hoeing ash-
pans on the pit without mentioning the ex-
citement occasioned in the force through
enforced proximity with such authority
when he might have been much more
profitably employed for the benefit of all
concerned by being up-stairs writing his
letters or devising ways and means

  he lacked the implicit confidence in
his foremen and they in him which is
the keystone of efficient shop organiza-
tion he was the self-tortured victim of
countless fears afraid that the engines
would not get over town in time for their
trains  afraid that the jobs reported by
the engineers were slighted in the round-
house by the foreman that the engineers
were carrying tales to the superintendent
and of numerous other groundless bug-
bears detrimental to his peace of mind

  this is far however from being a
general condition-the reverse rather i f
the master mechanic does not of his own
volition give his foreman latitude and
support he may be quietly reminded by

the progressive head of his department
that the policy is to have it so this
policy is to put the job squarely up o
the incumbent and to let him alone
waiving of course the general supervi-
sion which through the master mechanic
must be extended over all departments
if he fails to make good the painful
necessity arises to get another foreman
but the change can be made without the
recriminations which might follow di-
vided responsibility

the added care

  the work of a roundhouse foreman has
little in keeping with that of a machinist
although from this latter grade all such
foremen are produced the principal
difference is that before promotion he
simply worked and knocked off by the
whistle chalked his two dollars and a
half or three and a half as the case might
be on the proper side of the ledger and
forgot his job until the next morning
but when he assumed his present burden
this enviable mental condition sped on
its way forevermore

  the first day of promotion brings re-
sponsibility which will never cease to be
his portion through this and all the
succeeding grades he will work mentally
if not physically day and night sundays
and holidays until the company fails to
remit his monthly pay-check

  the problem presented in taking care
of maybe one hundred locomotives in
twenty-four hours may be truly defined
as tremendous and this number while
large is still far from the total which
some terminals handle in that time the
boston roundhouse of the new york
new haven and hartford has or did
have when the writer was master me-
chanic there upward of two hundred and
twenty-five passenger engines daily over
its ash-pits

  cumberland maryland on the bal-
timore and ohio before relief was af-
forded by diverting a percentage of the
number to keyser west virginia had
one hundred and twenty-five represent-
ing the heaviest freight power in the
country at that time  and the joint round-
house maintained by the chicago and
western indiana at fifty-first street
chicago takes care of the passenger loco-

born street station

  in connection with every one of these
engines there is certain daily routine work
entirely independent of what the engi-
neer or shop inspector may report the
fire must be thoroughly cleaned on ar-
rival or knocked out if the flues or
fire-box display any leaks the ash-pan

the engines toilet

  after receiving this attention on the
pit the locomotive enters the roundhouse
where the tender-boxes are oiled and the
engine truck-boxes packed or resaturated
- sponged up they term it an in-
spection is also made of the smoke-box
interior particularly the spark - arrester
to ascertain if the netting is clean and
without holes which might result in fires
along the road from large sparks and all
details of the running gear and the air-
brake are looked over by experienced men
for loose parts or incipient defects

  before being okd on the engine dis-
patchers board as ready the flues must
le cleaned either by an augur or blown
by compressed air and both engine and
tender thoroughly wiped for the sake of
appearance and to prevent possible in-
jury to the bearings through contact with
an accumulation of dirt and grit

  last but not least the tool equipment
carried by the locomotive is carefully
checked to see that nothing has been lost
bv the crew on the trip last completed
the headlight and signal - lamps are
cleaned and refilled and the allotted sup-
ply of oil and waste placed in the proper
boxes

  all of this work being merely routine
procedure is attended to by the same men
every day who work without direct in-
struction from the foreman and from
whom only supervision is required to
know that none of it is slighted the
following may be regarded as representa-
tive of the rates per hour in cents which
these miscellaneous roundhouse men re-
ceive

  ash-pit foreman c fire-cleaners

c ash-pit cleaners c  hostler c

-and if engineer hostler road rates per

day turntable man c box-packer
c front-end inspector c engine
inspector tc or c and sometimes
machinists pay tank inspector and re-
pairer ic  shop laborers jc wi-
pers c or piece-work tool-boy or
supply-man c to c fire-builder
c engine-watcher c and call-boy -
c these rates as a rule imply twelve
hours per clay but the organization in
some shops might call for ten hours

  these men are provided with books
made up of standard forms covering the
details of their inspection and the re-
pairs which the inspection indicated as
necessary when complete the books are
filed as records and for use as evidence
should a lawsuit involve the company in-
cidental to the failure of poor condition
of the parts

  in addition to these routine men a
roundhouse taking care of one hundred
engines will likely have twenty machin-
ists each with his helper for the running
repair work that reported by the engi-
neer or the inspector ten boilermakers
for leaky flues and repairs to grates and
ash-pans two or three pipe-fitters to
look after the innumerable leaks in the
joints of air and steam lines arising from
the vibration of the machine and the jar
of high speed and a boiler-washers
gang the time of which is fully occupied
in washing each one of these engines at
least once in thirty days or as the state
law dictates

emergency work

   as it-is impossible to foresee just what
conditions will be in evidence on an in-
coming engine great executive ability is
required on the part of the foreman in
order that these men may be distributed
to the best advantage he must con-
tinually adjust his unvarying force of
machinists boilermakers and what not
to ever-varying conditions and the solu-
tion of some of them has the riddle of the
sphinx outdone

  these big locomotives over which he
maintains unceasing vigil are contrary
whimsical even to a degree you can
never speculate with any certainty on just
what vagary will be next in evidence
any unlooked-for trouble which breaks
out generally runs in  threes
the roundhouse foreman



  there will be three sets of steam-pipes
to grind three pairs of wheels to drop
and three of the hardest driving springs
to renew this three is a popular super-
stition of the roundhouse but it seems
curiously enough to be borne out in fact

the feminine flier

  occasionally an engine which has been
receiving the best of care necessary
through its assignment to a fast train
and which has been a model of decorum
for many weeks will have a main rod
brass  fly up red hot without the
slightest warning resulting in twenty
minutes delay and an avalanche of cor-
respondence from the powers that be de-
manding that a cause for the unseemly
occurrence be assigned forthwith

  suoh letters pass from the superintend-
ent of motive-power to the master me-
chanic and thence logically find their
destination for the outgoing trip in the
smoky little office of the roundhouse fore-
man it is often quite difficult for him
to say truthfully what caused the brass
to heat and the engineer with whom he
takes the matter up doesnt know either

  it is a perplexing problem as a con-
vincing cause must be given for each and
every engine failure and often the fore-
man wanders for a long time in vain
speculation and in the face of demands
daily more insistent for the prompt re-
turn of  all papers before an explana-
tion can be found which past experience
tells him will prove satisfying

  another engine heretofore regarded as
more than normally faithful will sud-
denly develop a most inexplicable and
mysterious  blow the engineer will
report what his judgment leads him to
believe as the true cause-cylinder pack-
ing possibly-and the foreman will ac-
cordingly have some machinist pull the
pistons only to find that the packing is
ok the next trip the steam-chest cov-
ers will come up and with the same nega-
tive result they might even renew the
packing or balance strip springs on gen-
eral principles  but often the blow ob-
stinately remains until the engine goes
through the back shop unless some ma-
chinist finds and corrects it by accident

  there is a vast amount of time and la-
bor wasted in everv roundhouse in the

country in finding things defects which
although unquestionably in evidence
through the poor performance of the en-
gine are either not intelligently reported
or cannot be readily located locomo-
tives at one time and not very long ago
were simple and when something went
wrong there was little doubt regarding
the particular part which required atten-
tion now the complications are such
that they have if it must be said grown
beyond their operators on the road and
their attendants in the shops

   it is really not fair to ask in the face
of the exacting demand on every faculty
to get a four-cylinder or a balanced to
say nothing of an articulated compound
weighing two hundred tons successfully
over the road that an engineer be such a
master of its intricacies as to be able to
set down in the narrow confines of a
work-slip just which one of its multitu-
dinous steam-chests or cylinders harbors
a blow the roundhouse foreman is for-
tunate in fact if the engineer can con-
fine the trouble to one side of the en-
gine or to one set of engines which are
embodied in the grand ensemble

  this is true notwithstanding the fact
that the locomotive engineer of this gen-
eration is vastly more progressive in his
calling than was his prototype of only a
decade or so those famous and ex-
ploited runners of the past would stand
appalled to say the least at what their
successors have to contend with to-day

  so in the absence of the proper re-
port the trouble must be patiently and
intelligently sought for it ties up a lot
of machinists whose time is urgently
needed where trouble is known to be and
sometimes results in the big engine being
half torn apart before the defeot is
chanced upon

unavoidable waste

  there was an instance illustrative of
this on the new haven once in the bos-
ton roundhouse when on account of not
knowing just where to look both low-
pressure pistons and both valves were re-
moved only to find the trouble at last in
broken packing rings on one of the
small and easily handled high-pressure
pistons which could have been removed
and replaced in less than two hours


the railroad mans magazine

  the trouble in this case however was
that ithe supervision although in other re-
gards adequate and competent was de-
ficient in compound engine experience
knowing where to look however is a
great qualification for a foreman

  rapid fire good judgment is exercised
every day and in a degree which would
be amazing to even experienced railroad
men if they could be brought in sufficient-
ly close contact with the situation in the
roundhouse to appreciate it it is safe
to assert that the hard-worked foreman is
asked at least one hundred knotty me-
chanical questions every day and many
more of lesser import by the unskilled
labor

  the former will range from   ihere
is a orack in one-half of these brasses i
am filing do you want to put a new
brass in  to  take a look at the right
back wheel on the  when you get
around that way and see if you think it
is loose there is some grease working
around the axle at the wheel-fit and
maybe  do you think this tire is work-
ing it looks that way to me they
are mean questions too  nerve - racking
because the responsibility which the de-
cision implies is great

  even if absolutely no occasion for alarm
exists they are things which a fore-
man takes home with him through the
long night they intrude upon his well-
earned rest and speculation which can-
not be dismissed is rife on whether any-
thing has gone wrong in the now mad
race with time on which they have em-
barked since he left the roundhouse and
he feels much better to see them roll safe-
lv in during the next forenoon

shaffers forebodings

  one midnight and of undue frigidity
for even a winter night in chicago junc-
tion ohio day foreman shaffer was
encountered wandering aimlessly heart-
broken almost up and down the prin-
cipal street of the little railroad town

   whats the matter george-lost
your switch-key book of rules or your
job was the natural query

   no not vet but i feel pretty bad
they just called for the wrecker on ac-
count of the  in the ditch at the east
end of gallaghersville

   well what of it you didnt put
her there did you 

   im afraid so was the almost tear-
ful reply in fact i am sure of it
dont you remember this morning you
showed me two spokes cracked in her
right main clriver i didnt think it
amounted to anything and let her take
her run now she has stripped that
wheel and finished herself and it is up
to me

  just then the call-boy came running
hey boss mr shaffer he yelled
 the  just side-wiped a freight at
gallaghersville which wasnt in to clear
and she is down the bank wholl i call
for the wrecker-anybody i can get

relieved over a wreck

  side-wiped a freight repeated old
george in joyful cadence  so its a
run in is it thank god thats all
ive got to say and he actually essayed
a few steps of a snowy break-down of
startling effect in the pale moonlight
while the call-boy vanished in ill-con-
cealed alarm in the direction of the bunk-
house it was the first time he ever saw
a boss evince satisfaction to say nothing
of a jov-step through enthusiasm over
the woful tidings of disaster but he
might have understood if he knew the
relief his words afforded to foreman
shaffer

  to know what will run and what will
not or should not run and to decide
promptly when the troublesome question
arises can only come from long expe-
rience but no matter how momentous
the problem the judgment exhibited is
always sound there is no record at
least within the ken of the writer in
which an error of judgment on the part
of the roundhouse foreman became the
cause of wreck or accident

  of course intimate knowledge of mi-
nor existing defects as in the instance of
mr shaffer is disquieting when the call
comes for the wrecker  and when no in-
formation is at hand concerning the true
cause the conscientious foreman men-
tally reverts to the only adverse condition
of which he has any knowledge and for
the time at least may blame this for the
accident

no chances are taken anyhow in let-
the roundhouse foreman



ling parts run when in a dangerous con-
dition or even when in a condition liable
to result in failure although many even
including engineers will occasionally in-
sist otherwise it cannit be denied that
any roundhouse can exhibit an engine
with one or two broken wheel-spokes and
maybe with a driving center cracked and
banded another may have a main pin
with a vague indication of loosening in
the wheel and still another a fracture in
one of the frames

  this does not mean that these parts are
unsafe or that a chance is being taken in
letting them rim because there is a very
large percentage of strength in their
original design over what is actually re-
quired to stand the work which they have
to do when these defects do appear in
what are regarded as the permanent
parts frames driving-wheel centers or
cylinders - and the rigid inspection of
the present-day insures hat the discovery
cannot be long delayed-it is simply re-
garded as a warning to be vigilant and
if the defect develops or extends in suc-
ceeding trips the engine is taken out of
service until the part has been renewed

imperative repairs

  not by any means however can all
parts be safely temporized with in the
instance of defects when a flaw ap-
pears in a cross-head main or side rod
or a piston-rod - in fact in any of the
so-called reciprocating parts-a tyro in
the business knows that the locomotive
cannot turn another wheel until it is re-
paired and if the unlikely procedure
were attempted to put it on the road the
engineer wouldnt take it there is a
double check all round and the situation
predominates tremendously in favor of
its being returned to service in better
condition than it reached the roundhouse

   in addition to the actual work at hand
which is plentiful beyond the dreams of
avarice a singular feature of the round-
house foremans duties is the diplomatic
handling of imaginary ailments imagi-
nary although assigned in all honesty of
intent by the engineer

  a foreman must be popular and he
must retain popularity he is in what
might be termed closer  frictional  con-
tact with more powerful labor organiza-

  tions than any other person in railroad
service on an organized road and the
majority of them are organized he han-
dles directly or indirectly men alfiliated
with the international association of ma-
chinists the brotherhood of locomotive
engineers the brotherhood of locomo-
tive firemen and enginemen and oth-
ers of scarcely less importance

must be a diplomatist

  these powerful organizations have se-
cured signed agreements by both parties
with the railroads in the instance of the
machinists these agreements arc framed
in the roundhouses and shops and in that
of the others they are printed and bound
in book form for ready pocket reference

  it is intended by the company whose
proper official has signed them that they
shall be observed to the letter unless
the foreman knows their every item by
heart and exhibits the necessary tact at
all times to properly interpret the various
clauses therein he might work uncon-
sciously although none the less effectives
ly toward his own downfall

  sometimes a mans native mechanical
ability is jarred by a weird conception of
requirements for the betterment of a job
gravely advocated by some sincere but
mistaken engineer in such cases there
is only one thing to do-keep the peace
and listen without comment as all good
roundhouse-foremen know how to do he
must know how to humor whims and he
must be careful not to antagonize any
one

  there was a man named brown who
years ago ran a passenger-engine out of the
riverside roundhouse of the baltimore
and hio in baltimore maryland he in-
sisted that the insertion of a thin piece of
sheet gum between the block in the foot
of each spring-hanger and the frame im-
proved the riding of his engine  at
least seventy-five per cent the propo-
sition was absurd but as it was a small
job and brown a bit of a fire-eater in
the interest of harmony they put them in

some fatuous freaks

  ld pete yeager another veteran of
that locality had much trouble for
steam one season and after the usual


the railroad mans magazine

remedies had been suggested and applied
without avail he contended that a piece
of gas-pipe wedged across the inside of
tlie stack at the bottom would restore the
 to her own in the way of fog about
all the device really served was to split
the smoke but imagination and faith did
the rest at all events the  crossed
to the right side of the performance-
sheet after the horse-play had been ef-
fected

  the old  ran up and down the
plymouth division of the new haven
road for many months carrying an ez
traordinary device suggested by an en-
gineer to improve her steaming quali-
ties this consisted of a cast-iron cone
bolted across the top of the stack and
with the point of the cone dropping down
inside of it

  this was across the top remember
while that of mr yeager was on the
bottom beyond reducing the area of the
stack in proportion to its dimensions the
inverted cone had no more bearing on the
results either all these things how-
ever served one good purpose at least-
they lightened the burden of the round-
house - foreman who had the knack to
sneak them in even if he did have to shut
the old mans eye up to do it

the overwhelming routine

  there are certain routine duties of his
own which fall to the lot of the foreman
in addition to his everlasting struggle
with the unexpected he is required to

ok the individual time-slips turned in
at the close of the day by each man on
his force sign all orders for material re-
quired by the machinists and others and
to mark up the readv-board for the infor-
mation of the despatcher

  in recent years he has at least been
largely removed from one fruitful source
of trouble-the handling of the engine-
crews now the engine-despatcher takes
care of this and handles the call-boy as
well the latter in itself no inconsequen-
tial proposition

  before the advent of this assistant the
foreman had it all to do he kept the
turns of the engineers and firemen
straight as best he could from the list
of extra men which hung half effaced
on a grimy call-board held the call-boy

under his wing and  gave away  the
vacant engines largely as he listed in-
cidentally he saw that the crews were hus-
tled to the house in season to leave for
the depot without a terminal delay and
often rode with or chased them all the
way there to attain this necessary end

the extremes of duty

  when to these distractions might be
added the signing and the attesting to
the correctness of the engineers and fire-
mens time-slips shop-mens time wran-
gling with the train-despatcherper phone
over power getting the finished engines
out of the house to make shop-room for
the line on the ash-pit just arrived be-
sides maintaining an unrelaxing vigilance
over one hundred men representing a doz-
en trades it may be appreciated that the
roundliouse-foreman earned his meager
stipend

  it is meager enough now averaging
about one hundred dollars per month for
the entire country but it is improving
in that regard and also in the direction
of shortening the working hours of the
foreman

  the recent innovation of the erie
railroad in its larger roundhouses of
dividing the twenty-four hours among
three foremen each on an eight-hour
turn has met with much approval and
is resulting in increased efficiency

  of course it means divided responsi-
bility in a way as a foreman could only
be held accountable for something which
went wrong on his own trick but the old
plan of having a man in charge respon-
sible for twenty-four hours was too much
and this reform is not a day too soon

  although conditions have changed
somewhat in this department as they have
radically changed in the other shops the
roundhouse and its foreman still remain
largely true to the ideals of the past
half the roundhouses which you may
visit when in the grip of winter will dis-
play the same features which possibly
you recall so well-the broken window-
panes the doors which do not fit at the
bottom or will not close behind the en-
gines and which allow the icy blasts and
the shifting snow to find a way in just as
unopposed as in the days of yore you
will see the men out of a job and maybe
the roundhouse foreman



some with it backed up against the old
round stove with its stumpy stack their
wrenches and tools thawing on its tray
and grouped in the same familiar fashion

  the steam escaping from the housed
locomotives still congeals into a frozen
hail of minute particles through which
specterlike figures stealthily grope their
way each with an arm extended in the
same old way which protected you many
times from collision with a bar or truck

  over there a machinist is prying a jack
from its icy bed and in the circle behind
the house is the foreman indicating to
the turntable-man to run such a one in
here and take another out of there you
will observe that the same human line of
grief still circles around him and that
his epigrams and witticisms as each one
is dismissed relieved of his burden have
lost none of their poignancy you will
think maybe that time has dealt gently
after all with the roundhouse end of it
and you might wonder after these many
years how they can still find a man to
take this job when you know the equiva-
lent he has to give for the honor of hold-
ing it

  no spirit of optimism could ever define

it as an easy job with its grief and ad-
versity rightly viewed in their true pro
portions it would appear amazing that a
machinist accepts it especially in view of
the fact that his trade qualifies him to
make an equal amount of money in very
much easier fashion

  nevertheless you know its vale of tears
is trod by a thousand sturdy and ambitious
souls who rightly view that through it
alone lies the goal of advancement in the
service and the grand prize of recognized
executive ability in the railroad world

  apprentice to machinist machinist to
foreman foreman to master mechanic
and master mechanic to superintendent of
motive power this is the time-honored
road and there are few if any instances
of deviation in the careers of those who
hold this latter and justly coveted posi-
tion to-day

  without the invaluable experience
which came from the hard knocks in the
roundhouse they might not command the
ten thousand dollars annually which
many now receive it may be that the
roundhouse - foreman knows of these
things and they may help to explain his
fortitude and constancy at least in part

 steam-electric locomotives

a locomotive of an entirely new type
the driving-meehanism of which con-
sists of a steam turbine coupled to an electric
generator which supplies current to four
motors on the driving-axles is under con-
struction by the north british locomotive
company of glasgow scotland this new-
type of motive power which is called the
reid-ramsay system was described by
hugh reid deputy chairman and chief
managing director of the company above
mentioned in his inaugural address as
honorary president of the glasgow uni-
versity engineering society october 

  it was explained that this is not the first
attempt to develop a self-contained steam-
electric unit the heilmann steam-electric
locomotive built in  was given wide
publicity at that time but the reid-ramsay
locomotive it is stated develops the idea 
a different and more practical basis

  in the new engine steam is generated in
a boiler of the ordinary locomotive type
which is fitted with a superheater the coal
and water supplies are carried in the side

bunkers and side water-tanks at both sides
of the boiler the steam from the boiler
is led to a turbine of the impulse type run-
ning at a speed of  revolutions per
minute to which is directly coupled a direct-
current variable-voltage generator

  the generator supplies electrical energy
at from  to  volts to four series-
wound railway motors the armatures of
which are built  the four main or driving-
axles of the locomotive the exhaust
steam from the turbine passes into an
ejector-condenser and together with the cir-
culating condensing water is delivered
eventually to the hot-well

  as the water of the condensation is free
from oil it is returned from the hot-well
direct to the boiler by means of a feed-pump
and the supply of water carried in the tanks
is actually circulating water for the con-
densation purposes it is circulated by
means of small centrifugal pumps driven
by auxiliary steam turbines placed along-
side the main turbine and dynamo-rail-

why hutton hated bats

by robert fulkerson hoffman

             he relates here what the coroner
             failed to bring out - and more

-s-s-s-t there shoo you
  brood of vampires  

     quiet-spoken well-ordered
hutton sprang suddenly erect
from his plank seat just out-
side the door of the watch-
box at the top of the moun-
tain he flung his arms wildly above his
head and waved them futilely while he
ijmped a step or two forward and then
stooped to clutch a chunk of rock ballast
in either hand

  these he hurled venomously at a pair
of wheeling fleeting shadows that plied
tirelessly to and fro in ever-varying dips
and high-flung elliptics in the twilight
which was deepening under the over-
hanging pine boughs across the tracks

  with a muttered imprecation he faced
about limped back to where his aston-
ished visitor sat dumbly wondering at
this sudden eruption of feeling and
reached past him through the open win-
dow into the watch-box

  when huttons cramped and twisted
body had recovered itself from leaning
deep through the window he stood quick-
ly erect and faced around again to the
tracks in his hands was a high-grade
hammerless shotgun of automatic pattern
with practised skill he flung the muzzle
skyward and the stock to his shoulder

  for a little space his eye gleamed
like a living spark along the barrel while
the muzzle traced in the half-darkness in
miniature the fantastic dips and swift-
drawn ellipses of the objects of his wrath
then the gun spoke sharply-once
twice in quick succession

  there came a flabby muffled double
thud upon the tracks and from the
mountain-top rolled the echoes

   got em both  he announced with
deep satisfaction as he carefully replaced
the gun in its concealment and picked up
from the window - ledge a rusty claw-
hammer and two bent wire nails

   and ill get every last one of the
grinning little demons if im let stay on
this trick he concluded savagely

   bats ugh man how i hate em 

  he hobbled out to where the tattered
little victims lay gasping their hideous
last with sharp white teeth gleaming
evilly from baby-pink mouths catching
them up gingerly by the tips of the wide-
spreading membranes he labored on
across the double track of the siding
and climbed the yellow shale bank to the
foot of a huge pine

  with the eager energy of one who
would spike home a switch-rail past slip-
ping he nailed the small malefactors
well upon the trunk of the pine to the
intent eyes of the visitor the somber belt
of ruffled gray that girdled the red glow
of the giant pine bole assumed a new sig-
nificance that which his wandering
eyes had earlier adjudged a mere curl-
ing of the roughened bark he now saw
was row upon row circle above circle
of bats nailed with methodical precision
to the trunk of the tree

   yes well get em all by and bv
said hutton in keen content resuming
his seat upon the plank  but there
must be a holy show of them in that
crevice of rock up yonder if a fellow
could only get to them

   id a noticed this pair sooner maybe
only that im sort of took up with what
some fellows saying about engineers and
things in this paper i been looking over
just before you come


why hutton hated bats



  he tapped softly with the back of his
knotted hand upon the soiled and much
wrinkled illustrated weekly lying on the
bench beside him

   these writer people he continued
 they make a fellow think of the- old
cross-head pumps that fed boilers before
injector times

   sometimes theres just a little pin-
hole or a split in the thing somewheres
and what they dont put into the boiler
they splatter all over the right-of-way
but always keep pumping-wind or wa-
ter

   it makes a scandalous crop of rail-
road weeds and rubbish for the newspa-
pers and thats like the old plunger
pumps too for ive seen
many a section foreman
stand and cuss till he was
blue in the face when one
of them old engines went
plugging past with her
pump petcock open irriga-
ting the dry wayside till a
ton of weeds grew where
only a mild cutting grew
before-to say nothing of
what the foreman got if he
didnt sidestep

   but he most generally
did-the gang foreman-
and thats what im aiming
to do with this writer mans
little spurt sidestep it and
let it go by without cussing
for- the sake of the good
stuff lie did -get into his
newspaper boiler

   thats just when you
come along and the bats
break out and this writer
fellows spurt seems all of
a sudden to catch me square
in the face and carry me
back to the day that ned
hanlon and the rest of the
crew went smiling down the
grade here on hanlons en-
gine never to come back

   i take it the meeting-
point this writing aims to
make softly tapping again
with his roughened hand
upon the pictured sheet  is
this

   that engineers  locu-
     ii rr

motives dont cut the figure in engine
running nowadays that they did in times
gone the eagle-eyes not the big noise
now his wings is clipped by the des-
patches who deals out all the cool hard
nerve and theres never a chance to be
took lessen the despatcher hands him the
dare

   the semaphore guides him by day

	like a cloud and the red light leads him
by night gentle like a pillar of fire

   hes that hedged in and cuddled
down in safety in the cab that he cant
go wrong nor do any figuring for him-
self without getting clean off the right-
of-way

    no more gambling with death ties

jo the intent eyes of the visitor the somber belt of
ruffled grav that girdled the red glow of the
giant pine bole assumed a new significance


the railroad mans magazine

told just how fast hes to run each min-
ute and every mile no more winning back
minutes unless hes told the romantic
times is gone says it meaning i take it
that theres no more wondering whats
over the mountain or around the curve
what will hold strong and good for the
hill-climb what will let go and spill
whos a coming against him whos hung
up and cussing on the siding

   no more mystery at the end of the
rail or the end of the run the eagle-
eyes a stuffed bird under a glass case in
the despatchers office he couldnt break
out even if hes alive this paper makes
out

    well  its wrong  i says to meself
when youre walking down the track the
while back  but if you was-to try to
tell it how would you tell it  asks
meself

   and while were setting here quiet-
like the bats wheels up and writes the
answer in the air before me eyes

   its the unknown the mysterious the
thing you cant weigh nor measure nor
deal out over the wire thatll mark the
railroad and the engineer with romance
-do they call it-till the last curve is
straightened and the last mountain is
leveled

   and even then-which is no time at
all-if you looked across the brown
world as youd look across a sea and
sighted the smoke of a coming engine
hull down as the sailor says below the
rim of things knowing that shes head-
ing for you at a hundred miles an hour
youd stand there hungry but what youd
see whats to happen when she got to
vou

   you would 

   we know it well the mystery the
thing that comes always in a new shape
out of the unknown but how will it
come 

   look at them  exclaimed hutton
extending his long arm toward the big
pine and its gruesome ruffle growing
duller in the fading light

   would they kill a man on an en-
gine

    no youd say well see

   would they be the death of a man
cutting off helper-engines and holding
this watch-box like me

  again youd maybe say  no

   his arm swept out again to compass
the peaceful village far below still lying
warm in the red glow of the hidden
waning sun while they sitting at the
mouth of the open cut from the tunnel
were deep in the lofty gloom of the
mountains darkened head

   it was the end of a day like this
he said when ned hanlon headed out
of the tunnel-mouth up yonder the
semaphore-light at the telegraph office
was red against him glowing sharp and
bright in the half-dark of the cut and
the black mouth of the tunnel same as
now

   the vesper bell was sending the
same clear half-laughing half-weeping
sound trembling up here from that little
church spire down there in the sun same
as now and good old laughing ned
rolled them - fifteen box-loads - down
this train length of grade with the help-
er-engine coupled on ahead

   they stopped here by the watch-
box and danny roe cut the helper off
and crossed it out of the way while ned
sat in his cab-window and looked out in-
to the deep of the valley like he always
did

  yes ned seen it all just as were
seeing it and he called laughing like to
danny

  danny you hear that bell down
there in the valley that bells a call-
ing for me special to-dav

    hows that says danny danny
had this job of mine then

  come closer and ill tell you
laughs ned

     ive no time to give to yer laughin
ye rascal says danny but he goes
over close under the cab-window no less
and ned tells him low and quiet

    ye will   says danny stepping
back sudden and loud as a young crow

    yell be marrying her thats head
nurse at the hospital the slip of a girl
thats mothered us all one time and an-
other yell be takin away from us lit-
tle mira dale thats sister to all and
mother to manys the homeless railroad
lad

  well bad luck to ye for the sly
blade ye are and the best of luck to
ye both to the end of the world-and
then plenty

    thanks dannv says ned with his
why hutton hated bats



face red as the glow of the sun down
there in the valley

    itll be to-night as soon as i can
wind this string of box-loads down the
mountain get out of my bluejeans and
wash my face

    well its too bad ye must take up
this empty gondola then the trip says

car danny or are we only n the rip-
track  

    im not says danny  let her go  
 the car released when they cut her
in the brakes released along the train
when she was coupled in they set and
dragged all right when ned took the
high-sign from the caboose a bit later

he hears the long call

danny with a jerk of his thumb toward
the empty on the siding  but its or-
ders up at the wire shanty and ye mays
well pick it up without waitin till he
comes up from the caboose and cusses ye
into it yes yes i know ye have enough
but its orders

   danny cuts neds engine off at that
crosses him over and couples them up

   he fusses and batters so long at the
air-hose coupling that ned hollers quite
savage

    say are you rebuilding the old

and tested his air when starting down the
grade at the first move forward

   and then he took them over the lip
and rolling down into the long stretch
of the grade yonder with the weight of
fifteen crowding box-loads and the empty
upon his soul and the joy of his wed-
ding-night swelling in his heart

   but hes more than that hes the
question of the despatcher handed up to
him by word of mouth from the wire
just at the last minute before starting
thats laying heavy on his soul


the railroad mans magazine

  can he make up five minutes is
asked

   asked mark you not ordered yes
theres still something left to the eagle-
eye and the conductor theres never a
day that the two of them dont add up
the book of rules their handful of run-
ning orders and the sum of their past
luck divide it by three and do the best
they can with running on the answer

   so ned flashes his wits over the ten
miles of crooked grades thatll take him
to the bottom swallows the rule of twen-
ty miles an hour top speed on the grade
and says he can make it for the sake of
the ten-car silk train thatll be laying at
the yard when he gets there with the five
minutes saved

   all this is how he come to let them
roll a little strong at the start from the
top with his twin-brother frank as like
him as another self holding down the
firemans box and the head shack dan-
gling his feet from his perch on the ten-
der tool-box above the gangway

   yes the two hanlons-the  red-
ball twins we called them when they
took the fast-freight run together with
frank to be set up to running in the
month following-the two of them and
the head brakeman rolled down under
the pine-boughs and the quaking ash wa-
ving and wimpling in the breeze the sun
reddening the valley the shadows dark-
ening the cut here and the bell sending
up its evening call-just like to-night

   danny roe set here upon this plank
and listened to them going down down
deeper along the mountainside and he
talked to the red-pine bole across the
tracks shook his head and waited

   how do i know  he told me that-
and more

   not long he waited then the thing
that was aching in the bottom of his
mind came real out of his fears neds
long call of the whistle came booming
up the mountainside and the roar of the
wheels floated up to danny like he stood
on a cliff and heard the sullen booming
of a sea

    a little longer and he hears the long
call again then the crashing boom and
grinding roar of the likes of a landslide
from the heights-and dannys racing
down the grade afoot a wild man in the
dead quiet of the mountain

   no no yes i know the doings of
it but ill not say it

   ned hanlons air went bad thats
all ill say now of that he lost them
on the second grade we were ditched
at the next turn on the hip of the moun-
tain the noise that danny hears is us
rolling down the hillside in a splintered
heap of plunder when i come to at the
bottom im laying with me leg pinned
fast in the rubbish

   the blood thats dripping from
frank hanlons face and the blood thats
draining from me own is making a pool
in the soft coal where hes dug me face
clear and hes holding me mouth shut
and breathing the breath of life back into
me nostrils with his own good life

   ill not tell you more of that i
lived it once-

   eh

   yes i was the front brakeman

   its too fresh in me mind just yet
you see-maybe some day- but the
green you now see darkening in the valley
round about the village is but the sec-
ond green thats groavn above the face of
ned hanlon yes under the engine ned
was-

   well we lost them on the grade as
youve seen twoyears ago this day and
mira dale lays aside her brides dress
that night and dons her suit of striped
blue-gray taking her brave way back to
her place in the hospital stead of the
church

   when next im knowing frank and
me is pardners again but its side by
side on our cots in the accident ward

   the days drag by with mira hover-
ing over the two of us till after a spell of
setting up were able to slipshod some
around the ward-me with me busted leg
all bent but mending fast and frank with
his hurted head all bandaged and mend-
ing slow

   it goes on that way till were in the
convalescent ward and all the while
from the time that frank comes out of the
operating-room and the gas or whatever
they give him theres never a word in his
talk that shows lies been through the
mixup same as me

   at times were linked arms and shuf-
fling along the ward together like and
he always heads for the big end window
that looks out to the mountain here and
r

why- hutton hated bats



it gives me some of a gash above the eve

when were lined up
there he keeps say-
ing

    what are they
holding us for hut-
ton why dont we
get orders and go 

well never make it
this way 

    its plain theres
something bad hurt
about him the col-
ors creeping back to
his face but not the
light that ought to
be in his eyes

    so i says to him
gentle like at such
times after id had
a talk with mira

     its the mix-up
in the pass thats
holding us frank

dont you remem-
ber we lost them
in the run down the
mountain but its all
right now remem-
ber

    i wasnt in no
mix-up hed say
looking at me sober
as owls  lets get
orders and go home

  its that way
when the coroner
gets leave to hold
what part of his
court he needs there
in our ward i tell
him free all he
ought to know from
my thinking frank just looks him so-
ber in the eyes and says

    i wasnt there im running with
my brother ned ned dont make no
mix-ups say  what are they stabbing
us for why dont we get orders and

go

    well the coroner gives it up at that
hes got all he wants anyway for coro
ners dont need much more when theres
a dead engineer when hes gone i
slips away from frank and makes for
the hospital superintendents office

   going down the last flight of steps
from our ward my eyes is that blurred

with thinking about ned and frank and
all that with my leg not working just
right i jumbles the last two stair-steps
into one and fetches up with my head
against the corner of the hall surbase

   it gives me some of a gash above the
eye-youll notice the mark here-but it
gives me too more of the chance im
wanting when theyve lifted me in and
done the stitching that it needs

   id been thinking it a lot  me own
account you see and id slipped down
to the basement and talked it some with
the hospital engineer whos an old loco-
motive man and full of sympathy


the railroad mans magazine

   he agrees to what id planned some
days before all providing the doctors
willing

   so when theyre done patching up
me eye  ups and says to the chief sur-
geon 

    doctor will you listen to me a word
about frank hanlon 

    yes says he fire away 

    his heads not well fast enough
says i  will you give him into my care
for two hours each day i says

    i will not  says he prompt and
savage as bears  what would you do
with him if i did 

   then i explain to him he kind of
laughs with sympathy and my point is
made

    well you may try it says he  but
youll take a ward man with you and
quit at the first sign of weakness or when
the ward man says eilough

    theres a little clot there thats got
to be absorbed and worn away before
hanlon will remember the chief goes
on  but otherwise hes sound and healthy
as a young buck

    you may try it but go slow he says
at the last and i hurried away to the
basement cut head bandage and all

   i got a cap and suit of overalls from
the engineer

   when id made my way back to the
ward the nurses knowed all about it and
had their orders me and the orderly
walks up to where frank is standing
looking up here at the mountain and
when he turns from the window i hands
him the cap and overalls all quiet be-
fore he can make his question about being
stabbed for a layout

    come on frank i says j were
called for three-thirty

   he takes the things as natural as
ever and walks awaywith us to the fire-
room where the hospital boilers are kept

  what do we get he asks on the
way

  first thirty-four  says and he
talked along chipper as crickets till we
set him sweeping up and firing and fuss-
ing around down below

   we kept it up for three days in short
shifts and him talking railroad more sure
each day then on that third day when
the suns dropping behind the mountain
up here he turns away sudden from the

boiler-room door where hes been stand-
ing

   hes as white as death and the sweat
is pouring off his face in little trickles

   he drops weak like on the bench
inside the door and looks at me scared
and wild

  hutton he says wheres ned
was there a getaway on the mountain or
is there something the matter with me
all right hutton he says before i can
answer  i know now  

   we caught him as he slid off the
bench limp as water and carried him
back to the ward hes in bed a week
but keen and clear and getting stronger

   its two weeks more before were dis-
charged as cured and the day after that
were in the superintendents office having
our railroad hearing

   it goes the regular route of such pro-
ceedings and spite of all me and frank
can tell to the contrary its being drove
in and clenched that ned hanlon fid-
dled his air away on the grade and lost
them on the hill by having an empty
train-line when he needed air the most

   reckless running and bad judgment
was the burden of it when the door
opened and danny roe whod not been
seen since the wreck came in and stood
just inside the door with his old gray hat
clutched and crumpled in both his hands

    hallo danny   says the superin-
tendent  what did you run for where
have you been  come over to the table
well not bite you 

   now ill own that danny was rum-
pled and wild-looking but he got too
scant a hearing

    did you cut the air in for ned
hanlon the day of the runaway asks
the superintendent

    i did says danny crossing over to-
ward the table where were all gathered

   there come with him in the draft
from the door a breath of something
thats sure death to railroad jobs this
day

    there was bats- says danny lick-
ing his dry lips and clutching at his hat

    bats  says the superintendent cold
as ice

    yes  guess there were  

    ill ask you one more question dan-
nv and  want the answer straight have
you been drinking
w

why huttof

      im weak with the sorrow of it says
  danny  i took wan drink to help me
  to stand up before ye and tell the truth
  and if yell listen to me ill tell it there
  was bats in-

n   thats all roe  breaks in the su-
  perintendent  you are discharged for
  absence without leave i would not go
  so far as to say that you are drunk but
  we have no time here for bat stories you
  may go

      for the love o man mr sarchy
  says danny  ye wouldnt turn me away
  like that when im taking the blame for
  it all on me own self let me clear the
  name of ned hanlon that lies speechless
  and still over yon be the church and
  ill-

      dont make this thing harder for us
  all danny says the superintendent
  just pass out quietly now and save
  trouble you are fired

     danny went-and said no more

     but when its all over hes waiting
  for me and frank up the street a ways
  sober as ever was any man and the bitter
  tears streaming-down his face and this
  is what he tells us

hated bats	

    the evenin ned picks up the car
on the mountain-top im settin the while
before he conies out of the tunnel watch-
iii the bats wheelin and tumblin around
the big pine

   the empty neds to pick up stands
there with the air-hose liangin to the bal-
last stead of hung proper in the dummy
its me own neglect an im that worth-
less that i dont get up just then and
cross over to snap up the hose to its place
as would have been proper

   no i sets there lazy to the shame
o me watchin watchin the little devils
wheelin an dippin till of a sudden wan
o tliim spats hisself agin the car-end

an the mate o him swoops after and
clutches fast to the air-hose

    its all done in a wink an before i
can get to the brute hes slithered down
an crope into the hose-coupling

    i beats an pounds at it an im at

danny died of a broken heart and theres
only a short span -of eatth between him
and ned in the quiet down there under

lost and stolen cars

by pearson macintosh

       it is notorious that the smallest things often cause the most trouble the
       more perfect and complex the organization the more this is likely to be
       the case where by strict rule every trifling detail in a large system
       must be accounted for it is only likely that the least items will be the most
       elusive and cause more work than larger and more obvious assets

             in the routine of a great system the small things are as important as the
        big things on a railroad these small things are just as important as in other
        organizations and ten times more elusive the checking system that can
        approximately keep track of the rolling-stock of a great transcontinental
        line is a monument to human genius

the whirlings of the giddy freight-car over three million square
miles how difficult it is to keep track of all
its spiral twists

n the union pacific car service ago in that deluge a freight-train of

chase of
yet this

department the documents in
this case make a paper monu-
ment more imposing than that
which was upbuilt with all the
deeds pertaining to the pur-
the whole line by harriman
is a simple little case of one
empty box car that strayed got lost and
was stolen

  in the northern pacific car service de-
partment theres a similarly imposing
shaft of documents relating to that same
lost strayed and stolen box car

  the documents include principally
letters written by the two roads at the
time the car disappeared the tale has
its beginning in the flood that brought
devastation to kansas city three years

twenty cars caboose and all was washed
from the tracks a short distance out of
the city

  the cars were mostly empties and all
except one of them were afterward found
more or less unroofed undoored and un-
trucked lying thus amputated and scat-
tered over a square mile of kansas land-
scape

  the one missing car an empty re-
mained missing despite the efforts of
the parties that scoured the country in
quest of it with their very noses to the
ground that car was the property of
the union pacific and the road respon-
sible for its return to its owner was the
northern pacific

  twenty days elapsed still no car

the railroad mans magazine

whereupon the harriman people in ac-
cordance with number three of the  per
diem  rules for car service made for-
mal demand for the return of their car

  thirty days passed without a sign of
the lost car and now again in accord-
ance with rule three the union pacific
notified the northern pacific that it was
liable to a payment of seventy-five cents
a day in addition to the regular per diem
charge of twenty-five cents

  three months slipped by by that
time the car service departments of both
lines had grown so literary and had ac-
quired so deeply the letter-writing habit
that great sheaves of correspondence
were swapped almost daily

the documents grow

  meantime that car had vanished had
melted away as if it had been a cake of
ice in the warm waters of the flood  had
disappeared as mysteriously as a card
from the hands of a hermann or a kel-
lar

  six months still no trace though the
railroad people pursued the still hunt
conscientiously the northern pacific
according to per diem rule seven might
long ago have reported the car destroyed
and hence put a stopper on the ava-
lanche of correspondence and incident-
ally on the per diem charge if only
they had unearthed even the smallest evi-
dence of destruction

  but not even a remnant was discov-
ered-nt a bolt nor a board that could
be identified as part of that particular
car

  nine months no car but pigeon-
holes were choked to death with corre-
spondence the hill car service men
raged impotently at the failure of their
sleuths to locate the missing car and
harriman car service men made further
demands just as impotent for the return
of their property

  a year slid into history and thirteen
months by this time the union pacific
men were injecting sarcasm into their
literary productions meaning in effect
 what sort of fellows are you anyway
that your search for our car is as futile
as that for captain kidds treasure
in this way the correspondence grew into
reams

  now in the fourteenth month the
northern pacific men blue in the face
at being so long baffled decided to make
one last systematic search for that car
even if they could produce only its dead
body right and left men were sent
and north and south to scrutinize every
square inch of that part of kansas near
the flooded district to hunt as a man
hunts for a lost collar-button

a clue at last

  one of the sleuths of the northern
pacific on the fourth day of the four-
teenth month after the flood spied some
rusty car-trucks that were revealed by
workmen in the process who were re-
moving the debris of a barn that had col-
lapsed in the deluge

  the number on those trucks made the
sleuth aforesaid whoop with joy here
was part of the missing rolling-stock the
number was that of the car that was so
badly wanted and the trucks lay a quar-
ter of a mile from the railroad track

  but the hunter was not satisfied he
wanted the whole thing the other half
he bethought him must be near in
casting his eye over the geography he
finally caught sight of the name of a
patent cure for biliousness that was
painted in large white letters on a black
background half a mile from the rail-
road track

  in his huntings and snoopings he had
passed that sign often and as often he
had ignored it as furnishing no clue to
the lost car now however he recalled
that the name of that patent medicine
was emblazoned on the four sides of an
improvised stable

  he sought the farmer who owned the
nag that stood in the improvised stable

   whered you get that stable

   didnt get it just took it for my
mare it was once a box car as any fool
could see

 you remember the car number

how it happened

   no hadnt moren located it fore
a man came along and give me four bits
just for lettin him give her a nice coat
of paint along with them bilious cure
words
lost and stolen cars



    but dont you recall any railroad sign
on that car-a shield for instance
shield right i do stranger a
shield and in it was the word  over-
land 

   found  found at last 

  found you lost something stran-
ger  

   yes well trouble you to hand over
that stable well send men to get it
forthwith the  stable  and the rusty
trucks were sent to the repair - shop
there the patent-medicine paint was
carefully scraped away revealing sure
enough the number identifying the
stable as the long-lost car

  in the middle of the fifteenth month
from the time of its disappearance that
car now shiny in a coat of real freight-
department paint and otherwise reno-
vated was delivered to the- union pa-
cific and with the receipt for the car
in their possession the northern pacific
car service men danced a jig to the tune
of a comic-opera ditty entitled  and
the prodigal came back

  a few days later however consterna-
tion reigned in the northern pacific car
service office a bill had been received
from the union pacific for the rent of
that long-suffering car-a bill for twen-
ty-five cents a day for the first thirty
days and one dollar a day for each day
in the rest of the fifteen and a hall
months that the northern pacific was re-
sponsible for the car

and then the bill came

  for the per diem rules permitted the
union pacific to put in just such a bill
and it amounted to 

  a harriman man told me that in an
effort to get square the hill men sent
the farmer who had taken possession of
the car for his mare a bill for 
for  a years rent of stable and that
harriman man had such a babv-blue eye
too

  not only cars but entire trains have
been lost i know two stories of lost
whole trains for the first of these sto-
ries i am indebted to mr rivett car
inspector of the union pacific he and

i	with mr cotton a union pacific land
agent were sitting together when he told
about it

  it happened in october  a
freight-train on the burlington route
left omaha at eight oclock in the eve-
ning with orders to go to plattsmouth
nebraska which is south of omaha

  the despatcher responsible for the
movement of that freight-train sat at his
desk in lincoln to him the train was
reported as arriving at gilmore junction
a station a little south of omaha a
few minutes later he received word that
the train had left gilmore

  ten minutes passed and the despatch-
er should have received word that the
train had reached or passed the first way-
station south of gilmore but no such
message came fifteen minutes passed
and the dearth of news from that train
made the despatcher curious he called
up the agent at the way-station and asked
if the plattsmouth freight had passed
the answer came back no

trying to find a train

   maybe hes let her get by without
knowing it thought the despatcher

  forthwith he called up the second
way-station south of omaha at which
the train was now due by that time
twenty-five minutes had passed since the
train had been swallowed up in silence
from this second way-station the answer
came know nothing of plattsmouth
freight

  on hearing this the despatcher was no
longer curious he was furious thirty
minutes dead silence regarding that
train forty minutes the despatcher
now completely nonplused and biting his
pipe ferociously called up the telegraph
operators at all stations hetwec-n gilmore
and lincoln

  the answers were monotonously dis-
heartening not one of the operators
could give an account of the train

   great scott where is that train
then  cried the now blasphemous and
ashy-faced despatcher  i must stop
every wheel on the division till i locate
that train or-

  forty-five minutes had passed and the
despatcher proceeded to send the neces-
sary orders holding up every train be-
tween plattsmouth and omaha forty-
eight minutes forty-nine fifty and
then-


the railroad mans magazine

   good heavens  raved the des-
patches  has that train wiped itself
off the map 

   plainly the plattsmouth freight was
lost it had faded away like the smoke
from the despatchers pipe what had
become of it had it tumbled from a
trestle into the darkness of a ravine kill-
ing the entire crew or had it leaped
from the tracks and continued its jour-
ney across the farms of nebraska the
engineman unable to stop the runaway

   fifty-one minutes and-oreapolis a
station near plattsmouth was calling the
despatcher at omaha

   plattsmouth freight number--

waiting here for orders new crew ran
from gilmore over mop track instead of
over burlington without being aware
of mistake

  what did he mean the burlington
and the mop missouri-pacific tracks
parallel each other not far apart out of
omaha to gilmore where they meet
-we know that the despatcher received
word of the train at gilmore and its de-
parture therefrom then it apparently
disappeared into oblivion

where it had been

   now at gilmore the burlington and
the mop tracks separate after leaving the
station but continue south parallel with
each other though farther apart than
north of gilmore near oreapolis they
once more meet

  well then what happened at gil-
more a switch had been left open and
the burlington train had crossed over to
a mop track and continued on the mop
track southward to oreapolis where
it again crossed to its own track to con-
tinue the run to plattsmouth

   as both train and engine-crews were
new-it was their first run over the divi-
sion-they were blissfully unconscious
that they were playing in another fel-
lows back-yard and that they represent-
ed danger and death in a run over the
wrong track the mop side of this story
is not known but no casualties were re-
ported

   when the train-despatcher had wiped
the cold sweat from his brow he wired
oreapolis this order

    plattsmouth freight go to platts-

mouth the crew then to proceed to
hades without return orders

  railroad men have told me that this
incident is one of the most extraordinary
they ever heard of

he train that hid

  my second lost train story was related
by dan sullivan union pacific district
foreman for wyoming at laramie while
we smoked the pipe of friendship in his
office in the railroad yard

  one day a union pacific east-bound
freight-train of twenty cars with andy
smith on the right of the engine
reached tipton wyoming and pulled
into a siding to let passenger-train no 
get by the passenger was east bound
and as andy knew was right behind
him

  presently the flier passed tipton ok
then andy pushed his freight back on
the main line and followed the flier
past red desert he ran and on to warn-
sutter where he pulled up at the station
out rushed the telegraph operator and
cried

x  wheres no -i-the flier 

   she passed me at tipton replied
engineman andy

   the deuce she did  

   sure

   well then you must have run right
through her on your way here for she
hasnt passed this station-stake m
life 

   youre dreamin the flier passed
me sixteen miles back at tipton-stake
my life 

   youre a fool andy hustle onto
the siding quick that fliers still be-
hind you

  and andy smith sorely puzzled at the
insistence of the operator backed into
the siding

   but as that flier sure passed us at
tipton he said to his fireman  and as
i came right on behind her and didnt
strike her and as that feller says she
hasnt passed here then where in all this
gol-dinged world is she  

  just then andy heard the shriek of a
locomotive behind him the shriek of a
train coming east toward wamsutter
andy could not believe his eyes it was
the flier it stopped at the wamsutter
lost and stolen cars



station and conductor mills explained
to the dazed operator

   had a-hot box discovered it after
passing tipton drew into the siding at
red desert half-way between tipton
and here to get off the main track till
we cooled the box on the siding we
stood on the off-side of the coal-chute
hidden from the main track thats why
andy smith got by us without seeing us

  and from that day andy smith was
known as the only engineman on the
union pacific who could pass the flier
with a freight-train with both trains on
the same track and going in the same
direction

  now for the story of how a car dis-
appeared from the middle of a moving
freight-train despite the vigilance of the
 boys at the time of this tale link
and pin couplers were used

  it was engineman sullivans freight-
train of twenty-four cars that is sul-
livan had twenty-four cars when he came
over the  backbone of america at
creston wyoming where a sign-board
informs tourists that they are at the great
continental divide

getting out of the train

  but when the train got to rawlins a
division end twenty-nine miles from the
great divide the crew counted their cars
and found-only twenty-three

  a car had been lost lost from the
very middle of the train for they found
that the train had parted in the middle
but the hind part had followed on down
the hill so close to the fore part that the
break had not been noticed

   do you mean to tell me that a ear-
snatcher could steal a car from a moving
train  cried the conductor  you mean
to say an eagle lifted that car bodily out
of my train when we were running twen-
ty miles an hour you insist that a
zephyr whipped out the pins and un-
coupled a loaded coal-car at both ends
and then wafted the car away into the
ether 

  but just the same the conductor was
obliged to report  one coal-car miss-
ing then began a search for the miss-
ing car by all the section foremen and
their gangs between rawlins and the
great divide two days went by and

three and four and still no tidings of
the lost car

  on the fifth day engineman sullivan
was again pulling freight over the great
divide he came to a place where the
tracks skimmed the edge of a deep gully
on the brink of the chasm he spied some
lumps of coal and he stopped his train
far down into the gullv he peered
well im darned

  the conductor hurried forward and
joined sullivan in peering down into the
gully  well i am darned but what
sticks me is how she uncoupled herself
at both ends and dropped out of the
ranks like a tired soldier say sullivan
this is sure enough the great divide 

tale of two strays

  heres the story of two cars that
strayed from the fold in the dead of
night conductor tom wilkinson was
furious because his train had stopped
just beyond a curve midway between
kenesaw and hastings nebraska his
being a burlington freight-train and his
knowledge of the schedule telling him
that the express was not a thousand miles
behind him so wilkinson left his  way
car  and hurried to the engineer wrath-
fully inquiring  whats up 

   cars off the track replied the en-
gineman

   bosh  move on

    i tell you there are cars  the ties
as we came around that curve i saw
cars leanin way over and sparks coinin
from the wheels

conductor wilkinson looked disgusted
 all right wilkinson said the en-
gineman  ill move -but they was
leanin far over and they was emittin
sarksv

  the freight moved but not the whole
train the train had broken in two
they  picked up  the rear part then
proceeded to lincoln there at day-
light conductor wilkinson came to the
engineman saying

  did you say sparksi well then
theres two cars must have burned up
wheels trucks and all  because we lost
two cars somewhere somehow and the
old man is red-headed says you got to
pull the wrecking-train back and find
those two cars
	the railroad mans magazine

  that night the engineman pulled the
wrecking-train into lincoln on his re-
turn from the hunt-and at once sought
conductor wilkinson saying

   well we found your two cars

   burned to a crisp askedwilkin-
son  no then what about those
sparks 

   they fell down the embankment at
that curve between kenesaw and has-
tings where we broke in two

  yes yes but about those sparks
where does the conflagration come in
 there aint none the ties on that
curve were all splintered that shows
the cars first off derailed themselves and
the violent contact of steel on hard-
wood-

  whatll you have onme inter-
rupted wilkinson

an athletic car

  the last story of all is of the  jump-
ing car a car that could jump four
feet into the air like a bullfrog or a kan-
garoo the tale of this extraordinary
car was related to me by mr cushman
of grand island nebraska formerly a
brakeman on the  alphabet road -
the chicago st paul minneapolis and
omaha railway

  cushmans train a freight all stock-
cars and all loaded was doing its eigh-
teen miles an hour over the alphabet
road bound toward omaha when it
broke in two after hitching the two
parts together again the train moved on
at omaha when they  counted up a
car was missing lost but where or
how was a deep dark mystery

  next day the  alphabet  company
sent cushman back over the line to find
the missing car he got off at a station
about twenty miles out of omaha-near

where the train had broken in two the
night before as he walked up the track
he met a farmer whose property bordered
on the right-of-way

   got four new hogs to-day said the
farmer

   you dont say whatd you pay for
em  

   nothing donated  

   by whom 

   dont know donor anonymous

    lets see em

  cushman looked at the gift hogs all
four had chunks of flesh gouged out of
their bulk and were more or less bleed-
ing he tramped on thoughtfully to the
next farmhouse where the farmer re--
marked

   looks like folks dont want then-
own hogs no more some one made me
a present of six this morning

  cushman now tarried not nor paused
in making a bee-line back to the railroad
track on the way he passed  less than
a dozen hogs all straying around in an
aimless homeless uncertain manner

  finally he came to a place where the
railroad track ran through a cut at the
top of the embankment at the edge of
the cut lay a car in it were a lot of
hogs all dead and the railroad tracks
where they ran through the cut were
fully four feet below the level on which
the hog-car stood

  cushman hurried back to omaha and
said to his conductor  say boss im
going to quit railroading its too full
of the miraculous for me think of a
hog-car cutting itself loose from a
freight-train and jumping-jumping i
say-four feet four whole feet up out
of a cut like a toad trained in a circus

   ive seen a loaded hog-car that did
that stunt seeins believin and here-
after  aint pooh-poohin miracles

chapter xiii

a leap into darkness

ijve a man in a trance erskine re-
  turned to his own section
  in the pullman where he
  sank stiffly in the seat
  opposite mcgrane the
  irishman looking at him
  curiously was startled by his pallor and
  the dazed look in his eyes

  anything happened sir mcgrane
asked leaning forward and speaking anx-
iously

  by a gesture erskine directed the
irishman to sit beside him when mc-
grane did this the altoona man ad-
dressed him quietly

begin in the march railroad mans

  barney are you a drinking man
the face of the irishman fell  why
i take my drop sir he answered sul-
lenly

   did mr warrington charge you with
drunkenness on the night he dismissed
you from his service 

   when he taxed me with not report-
ing to him all the places i took miss
warrington to i answered him a bit
sharply and he said i had been drinkin
he supposed i told him i hadnt had a
drop that day which was true sir six
months ago i made a bad break or two
but he forgave me those no sir he
didnt fire me for drinkin

  erskine nodded thoughtfully and
leaned back in his chair the irishman
continued to regard him quizzically

maeazine single coplct  eeati




the railroad mans magazine

   some one been knockin me to you 
mcgrane asked apprehensively

   some one lias just told me that you
had been discharged for drunkenness-
thats all erskine explained

  the face of mcgrane grew purple
and she said that to you-of me
he muttered then after a pause he
added  and did you tell her that-
that something happened after she saw
her brother last  

   yes but she does not believe me

   but surely sir-

  erskine laid a hand on the coachmans
arm  there-that will do barney he
replied interrupting  she will com-
municate with her father at once and i
dare say he will tell her all meantime
we have much to do for the present
the two ladies we have seen must go
their way alone be careful to mention
no more names 

   but we will save her-miss-miss-

    yes barney we will save her if we
can

  the irishman leaning forward lapsed
into moody silence erskine gazed out
of the window for more than an hour
no words were exchanged between them 
then from one end of the car came the
voice of the porter informing the pas-
sengers that dinner was ready

  the irishman glanced at erskine in-
quiringly the altoona man shook his
head negatively

  no barney we must keep out of
there to-night he said

  as he spoke erskine drew out a paper
lunch-box and passed it to mcgrane
who was soon philosophically munching
a ham sandwich

  in another hour twilight fell and
shortly afterward the train halted at ber-
nardville the first stop in the state of
washington

  as the train stopped a sudden thought
seemed to strike erskine and he rose
quickly then made his way to the sta-
tion platform looking now toward the
other end of the car he saw louise war-
rington and her mother leaving the train

  the fact that both ladies carried suit-
cases indicated that they had no intention
of returning to the train this led
erskine to infer that they purposed tele-
graphing to andrew warrington con-
cerning joseph and would wait at ber-

nardville for a reply boarding the cas-
cade limited which would be along a
couple of hours later

  this action on their part appeared
reasonable enough and it was not im-
probable that upon hearing from an-
drew warrington they would return
with as little delay as possible to chi-
cago but there was another possibility
to be feared their action in leaving the
train at bernardville might be part of a
prearranged plan

  the cascade limited was due to stop
at bernardville in two hours would it
bring montresor

  if louise and her mother joined mon-
tresor they would of course report to
him the nature of the interview in the
pullman stateroom

  their faith in the englishman appar-
ently was still unshaken assuming that
warrington did telegraph to them that
joseph had been murdered what evi-
dence had he to connect montresor with
the perpetration of the crime the only
witnesses to the assault upon the ill-fated
young man were erskine and mcgrane
and these had made no report of the mat-
ter either to the elder warrington or the
police

  more than this would not miss war-
rington at once give public expression to
her suspicion that her brother was killed
by erskine and mcgrane who mistook
him for montresor a cold sweat broke
oiit on erskines forehead and tottering
like a drunkard he returned to his seat in
the car there he found the irishman
with his face at one of the windows and
scarcely able to restrain his excitement

    youve seen em sir he asked

  erskine nodded  yes he said

    well theyve left the train and you
aint goin to foller them

   no erskine muttered  havent i
told you that we have more serious work
to do than to trail these women 

  ihe face of mcgrane was now as
white as erskines own as he replied in
a shaking voice

   thats serious enbugh for me sir
and by heaven its the work im goin
to do before i tackle any other mon-
tresor has done for mr joseph and if
lies got any game on against miss war-
rington barney mcgrane aint the man
to stand by and see him win it
without lights



   erskine seized his arm  what are
 you going to do barney he asked

   im goin to do what you say you
 aint goin to do im goin to trail the
 women and you know as i know sir
 that that there trail is goin to lead me
 to montresor

    erskines face grew harder and there
 was an ominous flash in his eyes as he
 retorted

     it will lead you to the gallows
 the irishman nodded vigorously
  aye sir that may be ill not stop at
 murder if-

   you already are charged with mur-
 der

    mcgrane stiffened suddenly and looked
 at erskine with an expression in which
 incredulity and alarm were mingled

   already charged with murder he
 repeated wonderingly 

     yes miss warrington believes that
 you and i killed her brother who in the
 darkness we mistook for montresor
 the dazed look deepened in the irish-
 mans eyes

    now sit down erskine command-
 ed sharply

    they seated themselves together mc-
 granes gaze was riveted on the face of
 his companion erskine glanced sharply
 around the car fearful lest the gestures
 - of the obstreperous irishman had been
 observed by other passengers

    he saw that only four other persons
 were in the car and that these were giv-
 ing no attention to him or mcgrane
 whose words had been spoken quietly
 despite his agitated manner

     she cant believe that of me the
 irishman protested shaking his head
 dubiously

     she has said she does it is for the
 purpose of communicating with her father
 that she has alighted here and you for-
 get that her father does not know the
 truth we are the only persons who saw
 the tragedy and we have the appearance
 of having fled from the city

     that fact will be used against us
 a word from miss warrington may re-
 sult in our arrest before we have a chance
 to put up the fight we have come out here
 to make vve cannot succeed unless you
 keep your head and stop discussing these
 matters as we are doing now

    as the spirit of insubordination left

     	r r

mcgrane an expression of apprehension
settled on his face

    i dont understand it at all he mut-
tered penitently  but i wont bother you
with no more questions

   thats better barney erskine an-
swered wearily -

  five minutes later the train was again
in motion erskine and mcgrane sat in
silence the irishman was sullen and
as the hours passed it was apparent to
the watchful young railroader that he
was growing more and more ill at ease

  erskine now began to appreciate the
fact that he had erred in not giving his
companion more of his confidence and
yet he knew that few opportunities had
been afforded him for doing so rail-
way stations and the seat of a sleeping-
car were dangerous places for such ex-
planations as he had to give and though
he had confidence in the irishmans cour-
age he was not altogether satisfied re-
garding his discretion

  shortly before nine oclock the porter
asked erskine if he was ready to have
the berths of his section made up for the
night the altoona man nodded and he
and mcgrane made their way to the smo-
king compartment there they found
four of their fellow passengers playing
cards

  erskine and his companion watched
the game in moody silence for several
minutes then they returned to their sec-
tion here they found that the beds had
been made up and that the curtains had
been drawn

  on the way to wapiti falls mcgrane
had occupied the upper berth at night
and had removed only his coat vest neck-
tie collar and shoes before retiring he
was now about to draw off his coat when
erskine laid a restraining hand on one
of his arms

   no barney the altoona man said
quietly  crawl in as you are and
wait

  the irishman nodded sullenly then
fully dressed he climbed into the upper
berth erskine glanced at his watch
stretched himself on the lower berth and
raised the shade that had been drawn over
one of the windows leaning on one
elbow he continued to look out into the
night

  the train having passed through the


the railroad mans magazine

foot-hills was now within the shades of
the cascades themselves the night was
clear and by the light of the moon
which was in its first quarter erskine
was able to see with considerable dis-
tinctness the outlines of the dark moun-
tains which the train was passing

  at length the shriek of the locomotive
whistle rose above the monotonous rum-
ble of the wheels and he became con-
scious of the fact that the speed of the
train was abating moving cautiously
he slipped out of his berth and drew from
beneath it the two suit-cases with which
he and his companion had left chicago
these he laid on his berth then once
more he peered out of the window

  from one end of the car came the call
of the trainman

   two rivers-two rivers 

  erskine quickly raised the window
through which he had been looking
then he thrust the suit-cases out into the
night this done he lowered the win-
dow crawled out of the berth stood up-
right and laid a hand on the shoulder
of the recumbent mcgrane

  the irishman started up suddenly
 rear platform barney - be quick  
erskine whispered sharply

  in another moment the irishman was
on the floor beside him between the cur-
tained sections erskine moving rapidly
led the way to the rear platform of the
car arriving there the two men found
themselves alone

   weve got to jump it erskine mut-
tered  the train is slowing down and
there is no danger if you leap clear of it
when i open the door get out at once
ill be right after you

  the platforms of the train were vesti-
buled but in a moment erskine had the
door open

   go   he muttered

  the irishman swayed a little as he de-
scended the steps on the bottom step
he paused for a second or two then he
leaped erskine followed him

chapter xiv
a new peril

rt hough erskine had taken a des-
perate chance when he decided that
he and mcgrane should leap from a

moving train in the darkness and at a
place which he never had seen in day-
light he found luck was with him his
feet landed on a low gently sloping em-
bankment of sand and gravel and
though he rolled over a couple of times
before he succeeded in getting to his
knees his injuries proved to be no more
serious than a few slight bruises and
scratches

  he quickly scrambled up the embank-
ment to the track and there paused and
listened all was still and owing to
the fact that the moon was obscured by
a mountain which shadowed the track he
was able to see only a few paces away
from him a low whistle however soon
elicited a growl from a point about a
hundred feet distant

  erskine set off at an easy trot in that
direction and in a moment he came in
sight of mcgrane who was limping to-
ward him along the track

  are you hurt mcgrane erskine
asked anxiously

    ill tell ye better sir when i find all
me pieces the irishman grumbled
 twasnt till you whistled that i began
to know the difference between barney
mcgrane and a busted gravel-car i
barked a shin and twisted a shoulder
but theres no real damage done i guejs
and now which way is which sir

   well have to walk back after our
suit-cases which i threw out of the win-
dow before we jumped erskine ex-
plained

   is seme one after us  the irishman
asked apprehensively

   im afraid so barney the altoona
man replied gloomily  several hours
have passed since miss warrington
alighted at bernardville and by this time
she doubtless has had from her father a
telegram informing her of her brothers
murder

  if she carries out the threat that she
made to me she probably has telegraphed
on to two rivers that the murderers of
joseph warrington are on the west
coast express and in that case the train
will be searched we are well out of it
but must have a care how we pass the
station-for pass it we must-and we
cant get by it too quickly

   have we got to get to the other side
of it
without lights



   yes when it is found that we have
jumped the train a search doubtless will
be made for us in this direction two
rivers lies at the entrance to a narrow
defile between two mountains and there
is no way around it we must be on the
other side within twenty minutes

  without further ado erskine again
broke into a trot in the direction of the
place at which he had thrown out the two
suit-cases mcgrane followed him more
slowly

  in about three minutes erskine came
upon one of the cases and a short dis-
tance beyond it he found the other car-
rying tihese he retraced his steps until he
met mcgrane

  the irishman now had recovered in
some degree from the lameness that had
resulted from his fall and relieving er-
skine of one of the suit-cases he trotted
along at his heels

   in the distance the lights of two riv-
ers were plainly visible and the end
lights of the west coast express were
seen to be in front of the station er-
skine rightly inferred that had it not
been for the fact that it was necessary
for the locomotive to take water at this
point the train would not have been
scheduled to stop in such a sparsely set-
tled spot

  proceeding quickly the two men came
at last to a bridge which spanned one
of the two mountain streams which were
responsible for the name of the town
this was narrow and was soon crossed
erskine and his companion were scarcely
on the farther side of it however when
the train which had brought them from
wapiti-falls was seen to be again in mo-
tion in a couple of minutes its end
lights had disappeared from view

   the two men now slackened their pace
and as they drew nearer the cluster of
lights which marked the location of the
station they saw that the town was on
the right of the track and that on the
left of the railway there was a steep slope
to a shallow but swiftly running river
down this slope erskine soon led the
way and stumbling among the stones
that lay along the margin of the stream
the two men continued along until they
were well past the station

   at length erskine halted put down his
suit-case and listened save the slow

puffing of a stationary locomotive some-
where on the embankment above them
all was still

  erskine turned to his companion
 well barney for the present we are
safe enough  guess he said the
train wasnt here longer than five or six
minutes so it looks to me as if no at-
tempt has yet been made to find us in
this case a search will be made at the
next stop

   miss warrington aint goin -to
charge us with murder  mcgrane said
doggedly

   she intimated that she would and
we must take no chances returned er-
skine

  there was a pause then mcgrane
asked  and did you leave the train
just because you was afraid of gettin
arrested 

  though the irishman had tried to ad-
dress his companion respectfully there
was something in his tone that plainly
indicated that his employer no longer en-
joyed his confidence

    no erskine answered quietly  it
was here that i planned to leave the
train that plan was made before we
left wapiti falls

    well we dont seem to be any nearer
montresor for all the plannin that
youve done grumbled the irishman
who again manifested a tendency to wax
insubordinate

   montresor is getting nearer to us
every minute and if we do not make
haste he will be on us before we are
ready for him erskine muttered

  mcgranes spirit rose  we are to
meet him here  he asked

  no erskine answered sharply
 and unless we are going to play into
his hands we must avoid him for the
next four days at least if we are rec-
ognized by montresor or any one else
who has seen us before while we are en-
gaged in the work which is cut out for
us to-night we will have a still more se-
rious charge confronting us than that
which makes us responsible for the mur-
der of joseph warrington

   eh  exclaimed the bewildered
irishman and what charge is that

   train-robbery replied erskine
gravely

  train-robbery  muttered mcgrane


the railroad mans magazine

 in the name of heaven sir are ye
mad we aint robbed  train any
more than we killed mr joseph

   but we will said erskine confi-
dently  before we go farther i will
make the situation a little clearer to you
the cascade limited the fastest flier
this side of the mississippi will pass
two rivers in about an hour from now
on that train which left chicago after
we left it montresor doubtless is a pas-
senger

   with him for the present we have
nothing to do i the express-car of that
train however is the box which i point-
ed out to you in the baggage-room at
wapiti falls

   that box contains papers which were
responsible for the murder of young war-
rington who dying believed that i
would restore those papers to their right-
ful owner when those papers are re-
turned to the place from which they were
stolen by-by montresor we will strike
at the englishman but not-before

   then me and you must hold up the
flier mcgrane asked thoughtfully

    yes

   while its passin two rivers 

   no when the flier gets to two
rivers we must be ten miles to the west
of here near the entrance to the dumb-
bell tunnel the dumb-bell consists of
two round mountains joined by a straight
ridge which gives to the combination the
form of a dumb-bell the tunnel runs
through the ridge and before the flier
enters the tunnel we must have the box
we are after

   but how are we to go those ten miles
sir asked the irishman whose manner
had become respectful again

   somewhere along here we will find a
section-house-a place where laborers
who work on this section of the line keep
their tools and hand-car we must get
the hand-car as we approached the
town i saw that there was  section-
house on the other side so i dare say
we are not far from it now now as
we seem to have cleared the town lets
climb the emankment again

  the two men picked up the suit-cases
which they had set down and then they
proceeded to work their way up the em-
bankment to the track arriving there
erskine halted and looked around him

cautiously the town lay on his right
o his left he saw a small building be-
side the track

  with a low exclamation of satisfaction
he started toward it mcgrane kept close
at his heels

  as erskine had surmised the building
proved to be the section-house of which
he was in search beside it on a little
runway was a hand-car secured to a post
by a padlock and chain erskine knelt
down beside the chain and for a few
minutes his companion heard the scraping
of a file

   ye were all ready with the tools for
the job muttered the irishman approv-
ingly

  there was a great deal connected with
this affair that was a mystery to mc-
grane but from time to time the convic-
tion had been forced upon him that the
leader he had been following so blindly
really was working out a carefully for-
mulated plan now and then however
a suspicion would enter the irishmans
mind that erskine was working in his
own interest rather than in the interest
of the warringtons so far as mcgrane
was concerned his interest centered in
the capture of montresor and the safe
return of louise warrington to her chi-
cago home

   all right barney said erskine ri-
sing

  is she loose sir asked the irish-
man

   yes now help me to get it on the
track

  in a couple of minutes the hand-car
had been run out to the track and on it
erskine placed the two suit-cases this
done the two men mounted to the plat-
form and erskine bade his companion
take hold one of the bars

  the young railroad man grasped the
other and the westward journey was con-
tinued both erskine and mcgrane
were men of considerably more than or-
dinary strength and as they bent to their
task the car moved onward with rapidly
accelerating speed

  for more than a mile beyond the town
the grade was fairly level then it began
to rise gradually and the speed of the
car began to abate despite the increasing
energy the two men were putting into
their work at length however erskine
without lights



glancing anxiously ahead saw that the
end of the grade had been reached and
that they were approaching a decline
steeper than the one they had just as-
cended for about a quarter of a mile
the track lay straight ahead of them then
it disappeared at a curve around the
mountainside

   let go the bar but get a good grip
on the car called erskine to mcgrane
as he saw what was before them

  the irishman did as he was directed
then cast a glance over his shoulder

  shell go by herself he asked as
he looked down the grade

   faster than we ever could drive her
erskine answered  then craning his neck
to get a better view of the track he add-
ed  fi old fast for your life barney 

  a sinking feeling now began to come
over mcgrane as the hand-car increas-
ing its speed at every yard dipped at a
sharper angle and went clattering down
die grade both men lowered their heads
and grasped more firmly the metal-work
below the rapidly rising and falling han-
dle-bars

  the flying car rounded the curve with
a jolt that fairly took away -die breath
of the clinging men and then shot down-
ward  a grade that was even steeper
than the one above the curve down
down it flew along a winding course-
clattering and bounding in a manner that
made the swaying irishman feel as if he
was mounted on a bucking bronco

  erskine with set teeth was peering
ahead of him with anxious eyes when
there came to his ears a sound that
brought his heart to his throat and caused
a cold perspiration to issue from his
pores

  it was the whistle of an approaching
tram

chapter xv
the brink of disaster

cor a moment erskines wits forsook
him if the whistle he had heard
was that of an approaching train he felt
that he and his companion were doomed

  the extension of the chicago st
louis and western from wapiti falls to
tacoma had been constructed only a few
years before and between two rivers

and the dumb-bell a single track had
been regarded as sufficient for its pres-
ent peeds

  a careful study of his time-table had
assured erskine that no east-bound pas-
senger-train was due at two rivers for
the next five hours and he had reasoned
that  freight would be able to pass the
west coast express which had left two
rivers only a few minutes before

  the whistle which he had heard seemed
to be too near to be that of the west
coast express which speeding on ahead
of the cascade flier and with the grades
in its favor must now be five or six miles
distant was it possible that the express
meeting with some accident or obstruc-
tion had stopped and was just getting
under way again or back here among
the mountains was there a siding on
which a freight had lain to await the
passage of the hurrying passenger-train 

  the whistle apparently failed to dis-
turb mcgrane who had no other thought
than to retain his grip on the clattering
jolting and swiftly speeding hand - car
erskine however listened intently the
whistle reached his ears again

  this time there was no mistaking its
significance it was the signal of a
freight locomotive calling for brakes

  gritting his teeth erskine looked
around him wildly to jump from the
rushing hand-car meant instant death
and yet to remain on it for another five
minutes would seem to be scarcely less
disastrous

  erskine who thus far had thrown pru-
dence to the winds in his attempt to get
to his destination as speedily as possible
now reached for the lever which con-
trolled the brakes of the hand-car draw-
ing this back he braced his feet against
the steel base of die liandle-bars even
amid the flatter of the wheels lie heard
the brake-shoe swish against the swiftly
revolving metal disks beneath the car
but there was no accompanying diminu-
tion of speed

	and now the irishman suddenly be-
coming aware of die strepuous efforts
which erskine was making took alarm

  something wrong sir he gasped
as the car taking another curve almost
swung from the track

  hold on-till i call-then jump
cried erskine broken


the railroad mans magazine

   the car will do that im thinkin
the irishman retorted

   let us hope to heaven it does there
is a train ahead of us and-

  he was interrupted by the prolonged
shriek of a locomotive all doubt was
now removed from the mind of the man
who was desperately straining at the
brake-lever

  the unseen locomotive was rapidly
drawing nearer a new idea now entered
erskines mind

   here barney-here  he called

  in a moment the irishman was beside
him

   get hold of this lever and brace your-
self-so the altoona man directed

  mcgrane understood and acted
promptly

  erskine rising on one knee seized one
of the leaping handle-bars this was of
wood and erskine had observed that
it lay loosely in the rings that held it in
a second he had it free

   now look out for yourself bar-
ney he shouted as he crawled to the
front of the car

  as he glanced ahead of him he saw the
faint glow of an advancing light still
gripping the stout wooden bar he
leaned over the forward end of the car
with his right hand he clung to the pro-
jecting wooden handle which railway men
use in getting a hand-car on the track
with his left hand he dropped the wood-
en bar across one of the rails

  what happened in the course of the
next two minutes neither of the men ever
knew erskine did not lose consciousness
but his sensations were those of a strong
swimmer who suddenly finds himself in
the grip of a rock-pronged whirlpool

  bruised bleeding and unable to draw
breath lie rose to his knees a thousand
lights seemed to be gleaming before his
eyes and a prolonged sound like the roll
of distant thunder was in his ears

  in another moment he was breathing
again-but with considerable difficulty-
and he knew that the sound which re-
sembled thunder was that made by the
moving wheels of a train of freight-cars
which were slowly passing in the gloom

  with a rapidly beating heart erskine
staggered to his feet he was now over-
come by a dread that the train would
stop-that the engineer had run down

the hand-car and would halt in order to
learn the extent of the injuries of the vic-
tims

  too shaken and lame to be able to
fly from the spot erskine prayed that he
might be left alone all too slowly the
train moved on  but it did not stop and
soon the end lights of the caboose were
flashing in erskines eyes as he crouched
again beside the track

  farther and farther away moved the
lights but it was not until they disap-
peared afound a distant curve that he
ventured to rise to his feet and look
around him

  gasping and with his temples throb-
bing erskine staggered up the embank-
ment to the track halting between the
rails he listened and looked searchingly
from right to left all was still in the
darkness he was unable to see anything of
mcgrane or the hand-car

  the game which he had been playing
seemed lost to him now each moment
was valuable but without his companion
and his lost suit-case he could do noth-
ing

  for several minutes he stood motion-
less and silent then raising his voice he
called hoarsely

   barney 

  there was no answer and a prey to
feelings of despair erskine tottered
weakly along the track in the direction in
which he had seen the lights of the
freight disappear

  he ran  for nearly a hundred yards
without seeing any sign of his missing
companion or the hand-car then the idea
occurred to him to look for them in the
other direction

  as he turned he saw that the track ap-
peared to be neither up nor down grade
flis strength was coming back to him now
and he moved more quickly calling to
mcgrane as he ran

  at length thrilling with surprise and
satisfaction he heard a voice reply to him

    here   it cried

  a few moments later he came to the
irishman who was standing ruefully be-
side the track

   that was a narrow squeak sir said
mcgrane mournfully

  have you found the car asked
erskine

  not me sir the irishman replied
without lights



 one of the suit-cases landed on me as i
rolled down the embankment and ive got
that here but may the devil take me if
i ever want to see the likes of that sum-
mersettin car again 

  which suit-case have you got
erpkine demanded snatching it from him
impatiently then as he stooped to open
it he added  find the other one

  mcgrane turned away grumbling

  in a moment erskine had the suit-case
open- as he thrust a hand among its
contents he promptly identified it as his
own scarcely had he closed it when he
heard the voice of mcgrane

    ive got it sir

   the other suit-case  erskine called

   the hand-car

   never mind the car cried erskine
 get the other suit-case if you can

  he hurried on to the place from which
the voice of his companion had come

  there he found the hand-car half-way
down the embankment mcgrane how-
ever had disappeared  but erskine heard
him call  ive got it

  when erskine found the irishman
again he struck a match and looked at his
watch

   its all right barney he said with
a note of jubilation in his voice  we
have twenty minutes to spare theres
another up grade ahead of us and in the
course of the next quarter of an hour we
must get as near the top of it as we can

  with a lighter heart he set off at a
trot with his companion close at his heels

  maintaining a steady gait for the next
ten minutes erskine at length found him-
self near the top of the grade there he
stopped and listened

  no sound broke the stillness of the
solitude the irishman had disappeared

  erskine called his name

   coming shouted mcgrane from a
point well down the grade

  erskine stooped beside the track and
opened the suit-case he had been carry-
ing

  from this he took two small tin cylin-
ders two cartridge-belts and revolvers
and two black masks

double-track the sante fe

if this rumor materializes it will practically mean a new trans-
continental railroad

if the floating rumors which have been
humming around the local general
offices of the santa fe are true the en-
tire main line of the atchison topeka
and santa fe from chicago to los angeles
will be double-tracked the rumors are
being followed up with plans preparatory
to the mammoth undertaking

 to double track the santa fe means
building a new transcontinental railway over
 miles in length it will also mean the
first attempt of this kind ever contemplated
or thought of in railway circles it will
mean a train service from coast to coasnthat
will rival the dreams of the magnates for
years furthermore it will mean an ex-
penditure of millions of dollars both in the
active construction and in the purchase of
equipment and terminal facilities

 at the present time the santa fe is
severely taxed for the care of passenger and
freight traffic the traffic between southern

california and the east is enormous the
single track cannot stand the pressure and
even with the careful and experienced inge-
nuity of high-paid train despatchers the road
officials are not able to put the trains over
the road as the traffic demands there is
only one way to solve this problem-and that
is another pair of steel rails running along-
side the present pair

  at this time the santa fe has several
stretches of double-track in good use-a use
that will serve as a connecting link of single
lines for instance from albuquerque to
winslow the road now has a double-track
one being the main line and the other the
belen cut-otf this can easily be improved
into a double main line from chicago to
newton a distance of  miles the road is
practically all double-tracked then there
are various other short spurts which have
been doubled  account of the congestion

puzzling problems that will sharpen the mind and
perhaps help you in your work

       among a dozen others from various parts of the country we have re-
       ceived the following from mr niles searls of san francisco

            the x y z company was trying out a new freight-engine on a per-
        fectly straight piece of doublrtrack road there was a string of cars
        attached which made the train measure exactly one mile from front of
        engine to rear of caboose the train was crawling along at a constant
        speed the head brakeman started from the front end of the train on a
        speeder and rode to the rear end  turned around and came back to the
        front end arriving just as the train had moved its own length how far
        did the brakeman travel all speeds supposed to be constant and no time
        lost in making the turn

        also this one from mr h r middlebrook tacoma park d c
        assume a steel band to be shrunk about the surface of the earth at
        the equator circumference  miles cut this band and insert 
        inches more and reweld it thus making its length  miles  inches
        how far away from the surface of the earth will it be all the way around

the two men who had been sitting near
the door of the car became engaged in

voices attracted the attention of all the other

just one more kiss

a dear old citizen went to the cars the
other day to see his daughter off on
a journey securing her a seat he passed
out of the car and went around to the car-

  while he was leaving the car the daugh-
ter crossed the aisle to speak to a friend
and at the same time a grim old maid took
the seat and moved up to the window

  unaware of the change the old gentle-

 frequent revolutionizing

railroad men are not a very pan-
icky crowd the exigencies of daily
life and duty are such as to give them poise
and self-control

  but no man can quietly contemplate a
sudden revolution of the business which is
his means of livelihood without some
qualms and those veracious chroniclers the
sunday newspapers are always doing their
best to convince the railroad man that his
jving is likely to slip from his fingers be-
cause of the invention of some wonder-
worker by the aid of which trainmen will
be dispensed with and engineers will be un-
known if somebody invents a new beetle-
trap it is proven that through some mani-
festation of the law of gravitation railroads
will soon be constructed on an inspired
plan which will entirely eliminate the neces-
sity for track rails road-bed cars employ-
ees and traffic and that if this does not
happen then something else will equally
mysterious and equally revolutionizing

  a little while ago the electric engine was
going to supplant the steam locomotive and
still later an eminent gentleman was re-
ported to hold the destiny of railroads and
a gyroscope in the hollow of his hand rail-
road men who like to feel two rails under
their wheels need not yet begin to fear the
onward march of this much-heralded inven-
tion

  its most wonderful feats are as yet the
ingenious imaginings of sunday supplement
artists and although we all recognize the


the railroad mans magazine

high standing and genius of mr brennan
we who know anything of conditions know
the difficulties that will have to be cleared
away before his invention does any revolu-
tionizing beyond suburban passenger traffic

  an editorial in the new york tribune
 calling attention  the criticism of an engi-
 neering correspondent of the london times
 serves a useful purpose the tribune says

   the opinion is expressed that concen-
 tration of the load upon one line of rails
 would demand track construction costing
 more than that now in vogue properly to
 support the rails the writer for the times
 believes something besides cross-ties would
 be needed

    it would not be feasible he says to use
 twice as many ties of half tihe customary
 length because there would not be room
 enough left properly to pack gravel between
 them piles or concrete would give satis-
 factory service it is thought but they
 would be too expensive

    so original is the method he adopts for
 keeping a car or train upright on a single
 rail that the merits and demerits of his
 system as a whole should be subjected to
 rigid scrutiny investors are likely to let it
  severely alone until the economy safety and
 feasibility of it are amply demonstrated

    though a car of full size was recently
 exhibited in england the questions just
 raised have apparently not been answered
 what is now needed is a bit of experimental
 road on which a car or train can be operated
 at  or  miles an hour for a really
 instructive test of this kind the wqrld may
 be obliged to wait for years

  apropos of this subject mr william
 freyue of jerome arizona very kindly
 calls our attention to an error which crept
 into our april issue unwittingly we re-
 ferred to the inventor of the gyroscope
 mr louis brennan as an englishman
 when in fact he was born in castlebar
 county mayo ireland it was farthest
 from our intention to deprive the public of
 the correct knowledge of mr brennans
 birthplace or his illustrious country from
 any glory it may win from his marvelous
 achievement

  more power to him

a million miles

under this head in the april number
we took a brief glance at the long
honorable and efficient career of engineer
a g reynolds the engineer of the fast
mail train that ran into an extra coal-train
on the lake shore and michigan southern
a short time ago we believed that of liv-
ing people the chief sufferer from the
wreck was engineer reynolds who was

 making an extra run after he had become
 eligible for a pension

  it was to be his last run and it was his
first disaster we expressed the hope that
this fine veteran would not be deprived of
his well-earned rest and honor by this trick
of fate and we are happy to say that our
hope lias been fulfilled

  before our magazine had issued from the
press we learned that the company had de-
cided that engineer reynoldss unfortunate
accident did not in any way affect his eligi-
bility for a pension and that although his
record had been marred by the misfortune
he still had the respect and admiration as
well as the sympathy of all his associates
and superiors

  he has our hearty congratulations and
our kindest wishes



a new rule and an old song

this paragraph is about songs in the
firt place we are going to violate one
of our own rules and in the second place
we are going to make a new rule just by
way of compensation

  the rule we are going to violate is one
that has been in force ever since we started
running songs in this department namely
that we would not print one song twice we
have of late received so many requests for
 the little red caboose behind the
train that although we published it in
the october  number we are going to
reprint it here in order to satisfy a popular
demand the song is sung to the tune of
 the little old log cabin in the lane
now for our new rule it is not really a
new one but it is one that has been in abey-
ance for so long that it seems like a new
one we are asked for so many songs that
unless we limit the type of songs to be
given we shall find ourselves without space
in this department for our flwn burning
thoughts the main line is already crowd-
ed and the despatcher lias some difficulty
in keeping the train-sheet unkinked and the
congested traffic moving without blockade

  our readers ask us for all kinds of things
-from tennysons last poem to the face
on the bar-room floor and if we could
we would like to meet all these requests
fully but we cannot and henceforth we
shall have to limit our poetic obligations in
this department to purely railroad poems

  one of our friends asks us for  the
bridge of sighs but as this bridge was
never laid with metals we must refer him to
the library of his own town as we re-
member it the poem was written by tom
hood	s
on the editorial carpet



now to redeem our first promise here

 is  the little red caboose  

the little red caboose

 now i am a jolly railroad man and braking
      is my trade

i work upon the road both day and night

 turning switches making flies as along the
      road we go

and see that all the train is made up right

 we are always ready when we are called
     to go

its whether in the sunshine or the rain

 and a jolly crew youll always find if you
 will go and see
 in that little red caboose behind the train

chorus

 then heres luck to all the boys that ride
      upon the cars

may happiness to them always remain

 the angels they will watch oer them when
 they lie down to sleep
 in that little red caboose behind the train

 we hang a red light on each side another
      on behind

 as day goes by and night comes steal-
     ing on

 and the boy that rides ahead you bet he
      keeps it in his mind 

that all the train behind is coming along

 and when were near the station were
 startled from our thoughts
 by the sound of the whistles shrieking
 scream

we skin out on the hurricane deck while
the con winds up the wheel
of the little red caboose behind the train

 now this little car i speak of is more pre-
      cious and more dear

than all the coaches on the railroad line

 the reason why i say so is because it is
     our home

and we always keep it in the neatest style

 although we have no fashion lights or
     velvet-cushioned seats

 still we always keep it very neat and
     clean	-

 and many an honest heart beats there be-
 neath the rusty roof
 of that little red caboose behind the train

our friend  very english

 just as we were thinking that life was
 very dull monotonous and common-
 place we got aletter from an old friend
 his name or rather his no in de flume all
 our readers will probably recognize it
 is very english

 very english is a young man of whom
 we are very fond becausc he is always
 amusing last time lie wrote us he as-
 sailed us with a list of questions which we

being of a suspicious nature believed to be
mere traps into which  very english
wished to lead our unwary feet

  still we answered most of our friends
cross-questionings and thereby evidently
earned his esteem this time he w-rites to
us almost kindly but is still bent upon having
our scalp or the scalps of the american
railroads in general

  it seems that  very english  is some-
what of a railroad man himself and that
although his experience has been limited
to such places as africa south america
england and other places on the outskirts
of civilization we must extend to him the
hand of a brother or if he wants our scalp
why by all means let him have it

   very english  asks us concealing one
hand behind his back in which we feel sure
he holds a life-preserver let it be granted
that you have a single track two goods-
trains  q  and  r are going in opposite
directions with orders to cross each other
at a siding in this land of the free if the
engine-driver of  q thinks that he might
 make the next siding before meeting
 r does he go ahead and try notwith-
standing his orders cant i hang one-
on america in this  

  very you can hang on us just exactly
what you like but there are only two things
so far as we know which would prevent
an  engine-driver  from doing what you
say

  the first is his own sanity and the second
one the wholesome fear of a large and
commodious ean which would be very
probably awaiting him at the end of hisrun
perhaps you dont know what a  can  is
but it would be something quite sufficient
for an engineer who bucked orders so
flagrantly

  of course very you realize that we
personally cant be responsible for every
fool in the business some men think that
they should take no more notice of a
book of rules than the average man does
of the ten commandments but that is not
so really their attitude does not alter the
fact that the book of rules exists and that
there are severe penalties for disobedience

  after handing us this little jolt very
english  sends us a bouquet which we must
print in full

   your magazine compares favorably with
those published in england but being eng-
lish it would be almost treason to say that
you can nearly equal anything made in the
old country and compares favorably is
the best that you can expect dont you
think that my english has improved
honestly i had an expensive education-in
england
	the railroad mans magazine

 yes  very your english has decidedly
 improved under our careful tuition but
 even yet it is rather bad you will notice
 that in the first sentence of this last part
 of your letter which we quoted you handle
 your native language so as to make it ap-
 pear that the railroad mans magazine
 is english far be it from us to disclaim
 any honor which we can legitimately hold
 but really and truly we are not very english

the old songs

 of the old songs and poems asked for in
 our april number we give this month
 two  the night operator  and  the
 brakemans appeal both are old-timers
 and we beg to thank those of our readers
 who sent us the words such kindness is
 appreciated

 now all make the getaway

the night operator

 by j s taylor

  in his little lamp-lit office

 through the gloomy hours of night

 sits the lone night operator
 from the eve till morning light
 watching close with sharpened hearing
 what the sleepless sounders say
 talking with his wakeful neighbors
 in the stations far away

 conversation with his far-off neighbors
 drives the dull night hours along

 while his duties and his orders
 all the while his memory throng
 though his eyelids drop at midnight
 fain to close themselves in sleep

 not for him the bliss of slumber

     he must still his vigil keep

 all the while the sleepless sounder
 tells ws tales of joy and wo

 now it tells of birth and marriages

    and how hearts with rapture glow
 now it tells of fatal sickness

     now it speaks of wailing breath

 now it speaks of mournful ac-cents
 of some dear friends sudden death

 now  see a scowl of anger
 cloud the operators brow

 hear him breaking in his sending
 wonder whats the matter now

 tis some plug that is receiving

 hear him break and say  ga
 four or five times in one message

     ere he deigns to sound  o k

 now his office call is sounded-

 how the glistening sounder clicks-
 and he catches quick the order

 flag and hold train no six

 quickly comes another order
 for a freight-train overdue

 and the sounder clicks it fiercely
 hurry up the 

 now hes lighting for the circuit
 with some fellow working west

 one can never break the other

 each one does his level best

 quickly speaks the train despatcher

 how his sharp words ringing come
 stop i tell you slop this breaking

 or   send you rascals home

 little knows the man or woman
 swiftly speeding oer the rail

 how the safety or the danger
 rests on one who dart not fail

 even on the night operator

 seated in his lonely room

 whose mistaking of an order
 sends the train  awful doom

 kindly greet the operator

 he is human nothing less

 let some soft word kindly spoken
 serve his tired heart to bless

 oft he tires answering questions

 and his face looks hard as stone
 but the heart within his bosom
 beats as kindly as your own

 the brakemans appeal

 in the pleasant summer weather
 standing on the car-top high

 he can view the changing landscape
 as he swiftly rushes by

 while he notes the beauteous pictures
 which the lovely landscape makes-
 suddenly across his dreaming
 comes the quick shrill cry for brakes

 but when winters icy fingers
 covep earth with snowy shroud

 and the north wind like a madman
 rushes  with shriekings loud

 then behold the gallant brakeman
 springs to heed the engines call
 running oer the icy car-top-

 god protect him should he fall

 do not scorn but treat him kindly

 he will give you smile for smile
 tho hes nothing but a brakeman

 do not deem him surely vile

 speak to him in kindly language

 tho his clothes are coarse and plain-
 for in his breast surely there beats
 a heart that feels both joy and pain

 he may have a hopeful mother

 he may be her greatest joy

 perhaps at home she is praying
 for the safety of her boy

 how he loves that dear good mother
 toiling for her da by day

 always bringing home some present
 every time he draws his pay
on the editorial carpet



daily facing death and danger-

      one misstep or slip of hand

   sends the poor unlucky brakeman
   to the dreaded unknown land

   while we scan the evening paper
      note what its tilled columns say

   one brief line attracts our notice

       one more brakeman hurt to-day

two important conventions

the master car builders and master
mechanics conventions at atlantic
city new jersey june - will be of
unusual interest to the entire railroad world
in all probability these two influential or-
ganizations will be merged into one associa-
tion this was strongly recommended by
former president h h vaughn in his 
address to the american railway master
mechanics association and it is believed
that should the matter be put to a vote a
majority of the members of both bodies
will be in favor of the merger in addi-
tion to this the technical value and research
embodied in the various papers to be read
and discussed will render the  conven-
tions the most important in the history of
either association

conductors in demand

we have received from jerry wilson
of liberty indiana the following
touching contribution to the already over-
laden wanderlust classics mr wilson
found it in an old book we take pleasure
in giving it to the public again through our

which mr wilson kindly sent us to print
later

   swing her ahead

tale of a tramp

well we comes to punkin center thats a
     town in kansas state

and the brakie finds us hiding so he ditched

and it sets my think-box rattling that wed

      rattlers seldom stop

so my side-kick puts it to me that we find
      a place to flop

editor ti-ie railroad mans macazine

your  by the light of the lantern
some two months ago in reply to an
inquirer said  that promotion from
brakeman to conductor was getting slower
for some unaccountable reason here in the
west there is a demand for conductors and
later on there will not be sufficient to fill
the demand i was promoted after two
weeks any brakeman of three years ex-
perience proving that he has the goods on

the general again

editor the railroad maxs magazine

referring to the query of i s

fishkill landing new york in your
april number the engine general
is the original engine run by andrews and i
think that  i s is a little bit off this
engine after the civil war was used in
freight service on the old w and a rail-
road between chattanooga and atlanta

since then the engine has been repaired
and painted and as you know is now on
exhibition in the union depot at chatta-
nooga tennessee

kindly publish this in your next number
for the special benefit of  i s and any
others who may wish to know the correct
answer to his query the engine  hero

the jarrett  palmer engine

we acknowledge with much pleasure a
letter from mr c j mcmaster
malone new york which brings to our no-
tice some intimate information regarding
the locomotive that made the remarkable
run with the jarrett  palmer special in
 from ogden utah to oakland cali-
fornia as described in our maroh number
the distance between the two cities is 
miles and the engine that made the run was
the  black fox

  we are always glad to receive such letters
as mr mcmasters and we take pleasure in
publishing it in full

editor the railroad mans magazine

  in your issue of march  in the article
about the jarrett  palmer special i
note you give the names of several rail-
road officials connected with this train but do
not give names of the engineers and firemen
or other railroadmen that did the work and
brought about such satisfactory results i
am not kicking but it would be a pleasure
to many of your readers to have such in-
formation

  i was in the employ of the long island
railroad as a locomotive engineer in june
 and mr oliver charlick was the
president he occasionally took a ride with
me on the engine and as he was quite well
acquainted with me he would often converse
with me at hunters point station while we
were waiting for the boats to come from
new york for our connection

  at this time i was running the engine  a
j vanderpool   the greenport express
this was a fine schenectady or mcqueen
locomotive and mr charlick seemed to
take great pride in her

  mr charlick told me that mr huntington
had an order with the schenectady loco-
motive works for fifty locomotives and he
was trying to get two out of this particular
order as they could not build those he had
ordered early enough for his requirements
he had been made president of the lebanon
springs and bennington and rutland rail-
road which was an extension of the new

york and harlem railroad from chatham
new york to rutland vermont

  incidentally he asked if i was much ac-
quainted with that locality i informed him
that i had been employed on the new york
and harlem railroad for several years as
fireman and engineer and that i was at
home at chatham

  he then instructed mr c a thompson
m m of ihe long island railroad to send
three old locomotives to the lebanon
springs road mr thompson sent the
pacific which was later named the
manchester the james sedgley
which was later named the lebanon
and the  george f carman

  i was sent with the  carman set her up
and turned her over to the l s and b and
r r r he then got two locomotives out of
mr huntington orders no  and 
named  mountain boy  and  mountain
girl now the engine that made the run
from ogden to san francisco pulling the
jarrett  palmer special s miles with-
out change was no  named black
fox and was a sister engine to the
 mountain boy  and  mountain girl

  i took the  mountain girl  the th day
of august and ran her most of the time up
to february   when i was made m
m of the b and r road and kept these two
engines in good repair up to the summer of
 when the mountain girl was de-
molished in an automobile wreck running
backward on the bennington branch

  the boiler of this engine is now in service
in an excelsior mill at rutland vermont
the  mountain boy  is still in service on
the rutland railroad under the number
ioo although it seems interesting to see
such things in print those that have had
any familiarity with them like to see more
detail which brings fond recollections to
lighten our leisure time

pressing his forehead to the flag-stones
if it is possible it is accomplished if

plishment of today the full realization
of one mans effort a triumph so far-
reaching in its consequences so vast in its
relation to the future that it sounds like
the history of a dream

arabian nights   and at once the mind

  i	open for you the volume of life in
the book of now written upon its
leaves is the name of walter e flanders 
birthplace rutland vermont age thirty-
nine  nationality american station in
life son of a country doctor and poor
his ancestors were french but their de-

scendant belongs to the new world era

all that follows is a true story woven
from the career of a living personality

  that part of a life summed up in the
word  boyhood  is too ephemeral for
historical use-mainly for the reason that
a crucial moment in later youth may bend
the sapling another way and so the tree
thereafter grows

  flanders left school at fifteen years of
age and became a machinist a handler
of steel and brass and iron carving his
character out of metal with a cold chisel
for a stylus he stained his hands with
journal oil and wiped the sweat of toil
from his brow with a skein of cotton
waste he got all the grand opera he ever
heard from the hum of a lathe and the
crescendo of an anvil and his muscle
from a hammer of his own forging in
his own language it was  hard scratch-
ing

  he bent his whole mind to the work
of creating urged on by the insatiate
national demand for perfection in ma-
chines he saw the hand-made products
of mankind wavering from their supreme
position everywhere the country was
growing manufacturing increasing the
call for tools smote him on all sides con-
sumers wanted quicker action and wider
swifter distribution

  he dropped his hammer stopped his
lathe and went  the road as a salesman
leaving behind him with all their alluring
memories the scenes of his earlier life

the railroad mans magazine-advertising section

something bigger and broader beckoned
to him the risk he ran was nothing
compared with the benefits that might
accrue if lie succeeded failure did not
figure in his plans and he did succeed-
succeeded because he knew there was a
demand-and saw ahead of him the out-
stretched hands filled with orders and
dollars artisans craftsmen and manu-
facturers wanted what he had to sell and
they were willing to pay he combined
personality with business and to those to
whom he sold his machines he imparted
knowledge as to their uses li is custom-
ers got not only what they paid for but
some of flanderss inspiration gratis his
heart was in his business

  soon it began to dawn upon this ver-
monter that if he could sell other mens
tools he could with perhaps greater suc-
cess sell his own he discerned an in-
creasing demand for certain special ma-
chines and machine tools equipped with
ability to create and distribute he became
a producer his one idea being not only to
keep abreast of the demand of the market
but ahead of it he felt instinctively
that the great problem in manufacturing
was to minimize the cost of production
through mechanical means without de-
tracting from the quality of the output
in fact he set his mind to the business of
increasing the general excellence that
has been his life work

  during this formative period so neces-
sary in the development of one who was
later destined to take a supreme position
in manufacturing and commerce there
was forming in the back of his mind a
vague hope that his influence might be-
come universal instead of local all he
lacked was the right opportunity-the big
nation-wide call his business continued
to grow and with it his ambitions but
there was a restlessness in his heart a
galling sense of restraint things werent
coming along fast enough  and without
knowing why and failing to analyze the
situation to his satisfaction young flan-
ders began to chafe

  about this time  in the city of
chicago-thanksgiving day to be exact
-mr herman kohlsaat offered the sum
of  for the man who could first cover
the route in an automobile over a course

from jackson park chicago to evans-
ton and back the distance was fifty-
four miles the winner consumed ten
hours and fifty-four minutes in making
the trip that meant an average speed of
about five and a quarter miles an hour

  there were six entries four gasoline
and two electrics mr kohlsaat was so
shocked at the bad time made that when
the first car passed his house late in the
afternoon he had retired from his front
porch in disgust the papers printed
many columns about the event however
and a few courageous prophets began to
sit up and take heart

  history laid an egg that day

  two years later when the dingley tariff
bill was adopted the gentlemen in wash-
ington who watch over our destinies hid
the automobile in the schedule of  manu-
factured metal it was denied the dig-
nity of a separate classification

  in the meantime flanders turned his
face across the prairies toward chicago
he saw the race dimly and although the
spark did not work very well that bleak
afternoon  the road to evanston it
struck a new light in the mind of the new
england machinist

  something began to loom large ahead
of him at first intangible and shapeless
he saw before him the open road and on
its stretches automobiles and slowly
but surely there crept upon him the real-
ization that his day was coming a period
that from the very nature of things
might be delayed but nevertheless was
sure of fulfilment

  the egg in chicago began to get warm

  his previous experience had taught him
that it was useless to engage in an enter-
prise contemplating the sale of anything
for which there was not a widespread
demand he knew that the automobile
was in the experimental stage retarded in
its development by a very natural hesita-
tion on the part of a people who preferred
to group themselves with the spectators
rather than the participants

  as late as  the automobile was still
a novelty not more than twelve hundred
being in use throughout the united states
not more than twice that number existed
in europe

  suddenly the magic wand of demand

orders and in  the business advanced

forward in such volume that the figures

  he had mastered the details of con-
struction the business ol direction the
art of organization about him he had
gathered men into whom he had infused
a virility which displayed its power in
everything they touched they were in-
oculated with the kind of impulse that is
kept alive by a sense of pride not only in
what they had already achieved but in
what they intended to do as well

  how did he accomplish this almost im-
possible result by what manner did he
make his men into soldiers just as loyal
to him as thev were to their higher ideals
he picked the right men
that was his first step in a plan that
meant as much to the future as it did to
the present the only way possible for
him to work out his scheme and carry it
through and over all obstacles was to
convince his lieutenants that he regarded
them worthy of trust and to fix upon
them responsibilities the accomplishment
of which would justify his most substan-
tial approval

  lie selected those men as the machinist
selects his steel-with an eye to quality
strength temper and durability  will
this man stand the test without breaking
will he hold up under the pressure that
will fall upon him can i depend upon
him at a critical moment yes  will
take him

  and then there arose in his mind the
one big overwhelming query the question
that appeals to employer and employee
alike

 how shall i reward him
and in the solution of this problem
flanders rose to the supreme pinnacle of
his individualism the apex of his master-
ship of industry i give you the secret
of his success in one sentence

 i will let him share re-
sults

  in a word those who helped him reap
got some of the crop it was not be-
stowed because of friendship not given
as a charity not placed in their hands as
a concession to their presence but as an
earned bonus for honest work honestly
performed and because of which the cus-
tomers of flanders got their dues

  it may be interesting to whoever reads
these lines to know that i have never

interviewed the gentleman they concern

i	gather all that is to be said from
his associates from those who have bene-
fited through and been inspired by his
methods i saw hundreds of well-or-
dered cheerful men at his drills and
forges and throughout his shops with
their eyes on their work and contentment
in their faces

  perhaps the best example of the ex-
cellence of his doctrines as applied to
the business of manufacturing is illus-
trated in plant no  of the e-m-f
company at detroit the first established
by mr flanders

  that particular factory had a capacity
of thirty cars a day a visitor one quite
familiar with the automobile business
discovered in looking over the institution
that sixty-five cars a day were being
turned out

  how do you do this he asked
somewhat bewildered  your equipment
calls for thirty cars a day yet you turn
out more than twice that number

   i share results with my men i make
it worth while to them in dollars and
cents every car that leaves this plant
for shipment represents a premium to
every employee here it is true that the
plant calls for thirty cars per day but
 am fortunate in having a sixty-five car
crew

  that is how flanders explained it

  how simple it all seems and what a
tremendous bearing it has upon the qual-
ity of the output apparently it pays to
have the instincts of a human being to
possess red blood in ones veins and to
let that fact be known in business as well
as in private life

  straws show how the wind blows for
example to proceed further in a solu-
tion of the mystery as to how he does it
when the championship baseball game
between the detroit tigers and the white
socks was played in  the e-m-f
plant no  shut down friday afternoon
and all hands including flanders him-
self went to the ball grounds saw the
tigers win and went to their homes re-
joicing in the victory what happened
on the morrow saturday when all e-m-f
plants shut down at noon the impos-
sible yes

in niimiri-i-tiig thi advertisement it  desirable that you mention the railroad mans magazine
the railroad mans magazine-advertising section

  eighty-three cars left the plant in per-
fect condition and were shipped as usual
to various agents the lost time of the
previous day was made up the full com-
plement of cars turned out and every
employee got his full weeks salary and
his weekly premiums as well thats
flanderss way

  this means organization of the high-
est type and its fruits are shared by
the one most concerned-the purchaser
every employee feels the responsibility
of his position he is made to appre-
ciate his relation to the concern he
sees about him the interdependent benefits
that attend through the work of the man
next to him

  his heart beats with the note of
partnership and he achieves not only
the benefits of employment but the
greater satisfaction of accumulating prof-
its moreover he enjoys reasonable
hours and a week-end relaxation that fits
him to put his heart and his head into
the task before him he never finds him-
self  asleep at the switch

  the man who worked out this system
of endeavor with all that it stands for
holds that  a fagged mind is incapable
of interest furthermore he has a
theory that it is not natural for man to
work at night that the machine as well
as its operator suffers injury greatly in
excess of the advantage gained

  flanders learned this early in life when
he himself had to work over-time and
paid for it the next day in exhaustion
and indifference the lesson left its im-
press for all time and today no man in
his employ comes to his task tired-or
leaves it so

  his hours at the factory are from eight
to five his is a life of performance
and ever uppermost in his mind is the
one idea to make those around him put
forth their best efforts on their own ac-
count to go forward in unison the goal
of accomplishment ever in view

  always ahead is the share in the re-
sults

  if you were to suggest to flanders that
his heart actuated his policy he would
stoutly deny it with him it is simply a
matter of business the application of a
tenet through which he wins from each

man the maximum results if in the
transaction the employee finds additional
encouragement to labor so much the bet-
ter but first last and all the time he
believes it to be merely a good business
proposition

  he has tried every conceivable plan
and discovered that the idea of mutual
benefit is the best because of it the
machinist watches with more care the
drilling of a journal or the tooling of a
cylinder the forger welds with a firmer
hand  the electrician makes his connec-
tions with finer adjustment the leather
worker does a job in upholstering that is
a credit to his skill anil a comfort to the
luxury-loving buyer leaning back in the
comforting solace of its embrace the
painter plies his brush with measured
precision and the varnisher lays on the
gloss as the master touches his picture
for the exhibition

  always there is pride at the workmans
elbow urging him on to perfection and
finish and beauty and when the work is
done and the glistening car rolls out on
the shipping-platform tested complete
and perfect in every detail those men
through whose hands it has passed know
that it represents something more than
a mass of metal and trappings hastily
thrown together and thrust upon the mar-
ket against time to perish because of its
weaknesses and tumble into the junk-heap
it is something that will endure and
they made it

  when an e-m-f employee sees one of
the companys cars  the thoroughfare
his face lights up with pleasure lie
knows it to be built on honor part of
it is his own and he is certain that the
man at the wheel is benefited in satisfac-
tion as was the builder in premiums and
pride

  that knowledge is an asset of incal-
culable worth a circumstance that plays
a strong part in the transaction of dis-
tribution and salesmanship the buying
public is too shrewd not to take advan-
tage of the inspiration that contributes
to the creation of such a machine

  and so the army of men behind
flanders march onward adding to their
strength winning new positions in the
manufacturing world opening up new

territory planting the standard of ac-
complishment along the highway each
private just as sure of his strength as the
crusader who blazed the way

  because of these conditions and with
the impetus created the e-m-f com-
pany found itself in a strategic position
its enterprise attracted the attention not
only of the dealers but the public as
well from every quarter of the union
buyers sought its output a steady stream
of orders came to detroit and the plant
found itself taxed to its utmost

  the business grew so fast that the old
plan of distribution and sale was found
inadequate to meet the clamor for cars
flanders discerning a cloud on the hori-
zon decided to reorganize his sales force
to establish e-m-f salesmen -in a thou-
sand american cities to develop new con-
cerns throughout the country whose sole
mission was to handle the e-m-f 
and the flanders    to the exclusion
of all other cars and moreover to begin
with the thirty-five metropolitan centers
at once

  it was a proposition of unusual pro-
portions requiring a prompt decision as
to the program by which it was to be
brought about during the halt to plan
this step twelve hundred cars had accu-
mulated in the stock-rooms flanders
himself had held them back pending his
coup he took twenty-four hours off for
deliberation mapped the whole thing out
to its minutest detail and sent for his
advertising manager mr e leroy pel-
letier

  the conference was short and to the
point

   the e-m-f company is ready to
close with a representative in thirty-five
american cities to handle its product
direct instead of through the sales or-
ganization which formerly acted as its
distributer that was the burden of his
statement

  mr pelletier stated that he would pre-
pare the advertising immediately

   how much time have we got in which
to do this  he asked

  ten days answered flanders
 phrase the advertisement to suit your-
self all i want to offer is this para-
graph

  he handed mr pelletier a slip of
paper upon which was written

   a splendid opportunity for hustling
young men of good standing having ex-
perience in selling large quantities of auto-
mobiles and with sufficient backing to
finance this proposition to form a sales
company the e-m-f company will co-
operate with you in establishing a permanent
business corporation

   the mails are pretty slow for such
an occasion volunteered pelletier

   youre quite right said flanders

 use the telegraph make the copy for
half pages and use two dailies in each
city the rest of the work is up to you
do whatever you think best

  and so the work was turned over to
the lieutenant and before sundown the
copy was prepared and hashed to the
thirty-five largest cities in the union it
was a gigantic stroke of business

  the forty-six words embodied in flan-
derss contribution to that advertisement
had a telling effect on the wide-awake
automobile men throughout the coun-
try as indicated by the fact that on the
following day there started from san
francisco on the same train six men
with ample backing bent on getting to
detroit for the sole purpose of securing
the agency

  and from other sections not so remote
as san francisco they poured into de-
troit on every train the successful san
franciscan took three hundred cars on his
first order paid cash for fifty and left
shipping instructions for the remaining
two hundred and fifty a sight draft
was attached to each bill of lading

  within the ten days specified the
twelve hundred cars were cleaned out of
the e-m-f store-rooms four hundred
more were ordered and one million dol-
lars had poured into the strong box of
the company added to which were -
 additional in future orders

  it does not require a mathematician to
figure out just what flanderss plunge
meant to the e-m-f company let us
calculate the value of those forty-six
words that he contributed to the adver-
tisement based on the  re-
sults in actual money it figures out
 per word

  rather high rates for a man who isnt
addicted to the writing habit occasion-
ally a dream comes true

  quite naturally this performance stag-
gered the automobile world and startled
flanderss competitors as a matter of
fact it did more than that it woke up
capital and drew the attention of wall
street to the significant fact that a new
giant in the industrial world a modern
 colossus of roads  had reared his head
in detroit and was about to march upon
the open highway and claim his share of
the rewards of progress it had none of
the significance of a raid it was business
and salesmanship pure and simple the
idea was huge with promise and the money
powers knew it had come to stay

  what all this meant to the banking
world will be the more appreciated when
it is pointed out that less than two years
ago it was practically impossible to bor-
row a dollar on an automobile manufac-
turing proposition it was considered too
great a risk for the conservative banking
world to undertake and a deaf ear was
turned to every appeal

  only private capital had the courage to
invest-and always against the advice of
the bankers other sources of supply re-
mained aloof within the last year how-
ever the situation showed signs of relax-
ing and the money powers encouraged
and attracted by the steady growth of the
business and the rapidly increasing de-
mand for automobiles of all kinds came
forward with offers of support to several
companies that had established a firm
footing

  nothing however in the automobile
business appeared to have made the im-
pression that was occasioned by flan-
derss achievement and in the face of
such odds it was gigantic in its prom-
ise and awakened a lively discussion and
interest

  flanders must be seen at once lie had
done something that entitled him to se-
rious consideration he was invited to
come to new york and consult with a
representative of the leading bankers
several meetings were held  what
had the vermont machinist to sell how
much did lie consider it worth how
old was the business had he any plans

for the future  were the books acces-
sible etc etc

  flanders presented his case briefly
his total investment in twenty months
amounted to  his pay-roll num-
bered about  and it was agreeable
to him that the probable purchaser install
an expert accountant to go over his
books he was of the opinion that about
 would be sufficient to close
the deal and turn over the e-m-f com-
pany to whoever wished to secure pos-
session of the property together with
what it meant to the future of automo-
bile manufacturing

  the banker with that foresight which
has marked his course in similar large
industrial enterprises considered the
flanders proposition a fair one and the
transaction was closed upon those terms
thus the e-m-f companys original in-
vestment was turned over in twenty
months multiplied thirty-two times

  wait that is not all flanders had
some partners a group of men who had
gathered under his standard when the
outlook was not so encouraging and dar-
ing was fraught with peril-a band of
faithful followers who had cast their lot
with him when fortune was not smiling
so broadly they must be cared for
their stock holdings taken up and for
cash very well

  what did flanders consider proper in
the circumstances well about eight for
one the banker agreed and it was set-
tled on that basis those men became
rich overnight and flanders was satis-
fied how well the sharing policy
worked out-just as flanders meant it
should all his promises were kept and
the original organization with all its
heart and energy and inspiration got its
dues

  those men are still with the e-m-f
company and flanders

  what did the new investors buy be-
sides the good-will and the plant the
appraisers passed on the pile of brick and
mortar the equipment and the stock and
summed up the worth of the concern in
all its inert majesty there it stood a
monument to its builder a structure into
which he had injected all of himself and
into which he led twelve thousand or

the railroad mans magazine-advertising section

more active loyal workmen from whose
brains and hands he had moulded success
for all of them each man asked the
question if not to his neighbor to him-
self 

 what will the new boss
do with us

  it was a dramatic situation marked
with suspense-yes with alarm

  flanders meant more to those men
than they could possibly convey to the
new owners and they wished to know
what was to become of him one day
a whisper ran through the factory it
leaped from lip to lip from floor to
floor through the assembling-room out
into the foundry back into the offices
down the long aisles of the machine-
shop up and across and through the
yards past the gatemen and then by
phone to the homes and over the conti-
nent to the salesmen and twelve thousand
pulses began to beat faster

 flanders was to remain
in charge

  the new interests wise in their pros-
perity had secured not only the plant
and its good-will but the big man with
the shock of tousled curly hair the
beetling brows of the elder dumas and
the instincts of brotherhood

  they had retained the man whose mot-
to is  he who shares results lives after
he is gone he who does not dies and
is forgotten

  when flanders speaks of the e-m-f
company he refers always to his lieu-
tenants whatever he has achieved he
charges to them he takes little or no
credit for himself his only claim is
that he knows a good man when he sees
one also he knows the business of au-
tomobile manufacturing in all its phases

   his influence in the industry extends to
the remotest corners of the globe every
rubber company in the world looks to
him for some of his business the cattle
on a thousand hills sooner or later con-
tribute hides for leather the steel forg-
ers and brass makers and iron kings come
inevitably to his doors for trade the
hardwood forests of the tropics pass
through his planers and a river of lubri-
cating oil runs through his automatic
machines

  where in this country is there a more
encouraging example for the youth who
is scanning the horizon of his life in
search of an opportunity flanders
proves that opportunities can be made
for whatever he has achieved is traceable
to his own efforts coupled with a sense
of justice and fair dealing with his fel-
low man

  his is the life drama of one who
learned a trade worked out its details
and then hoisted his flag for business
he knew what he wanted to do and how
to do it with one blow he struck the
high clear note of organization plus com-
pensation in the hands that were lifted
to signify a willingness to go on the
firing-line he put the tools with which
to work  in their heartsthe fervor of
enthusiasm and in their pockets the re-
ward

  he raised wages gave the people bet-
ter cars brought new-ideas to the business
of distribution and manufacture and the
banking world came to his doors

  he saw from the capital of experience
just what was needed to awaken the vast
opportunity summed up in the word mo-
tor-car it did not require a colossus to
observe these things  nor yet a colossus
to lay the plans but it did require a
colossus to put the plans into execution
-to instil into the men the kind of stim-
ulus and understanding that would di-
rectly benefit the buying public it was
not a problem in psychology it was just
a proposition of everyday plain amer-
ican commonsense applied to modern con-
ditions with a rather clear eye on the
future

  it was adding a personality to an in-
dustry vitalizing a trade puttingbreath
and head and heart into a machine and
 whacking up  with the other fellow

   he who shares results lives after he
is gone he who does not dies and is
forgotten

  flanders not only made his epigram
but unlike the satrap accomplished the
seemingly impossible as well and out
of it grew an empire n the industrial
world which all other powers in the par-
liament of progress recognize for what it
has already done and respect for what it
intends to do

your greatest help in

reducing the cost of living

 is a refrigerator that will keep your food fresh and pure
 with the least trouble and the least expense for ice

bohn syphon refrigerators

 lined wlh genuine white porcelain enamel-not paint -
 are the easiest to keep sweet and clean wiping with a moist
 cloth is the only labor much so-called enamel is merely
 enamel paint has not the glossy surface of genuine porce-
 lain enamel and in a short time discolors cracks and peels
 off into the provisions

    bohn syphon refrigerators use the least ice and keep
 food absolutely fresh and uncontaminated because they are
 built with perfect insulation to keep out the heat and perfect
 air circulation to keep the inside dry and cool a wet cloth
 hung in the provision chamber will dry more quickly than
 in the outside air remember it is dampness which spoils
 food melts your ice and makes your refrigerator un-
 sanitary

    the health of your entire household depends on the re-
 frigerator you keep your milk and butter and meat and veg-
 etables in therefore you ought to know exactly how it is
 constructed

the powder that
shortens the shave

colgat

f men knew how to lather they
would shave with more comfort

     the action of lather on the beard is a double one the oily 
 exudation which covers each hair is removed by the soap this
 allows the water to get to the hair moistening and softening it

       a certain amount of friction aids the lather in the performance of its duty 
  too much friction irritates the skin and causes that smarting for which soap or 
  razor is often blamed

     it follows that the method of lathering which most thoroughly
 penetrates the oil-covered hairs with the least amount of rubbing
 is not only the quickest manner of shaving but the most comfortable

      as mixing the lather in a cup and then spreading it over the face does
  not properly soften the beard many shavers resort to that  mussy  habit of
  rubbing in the lather with the fingers this rubbing in not only means skin
  irritation but a waste of time and is entirely unnecessary

     so it is logical that the proper place to mix the lather is on
 the face where every motion of the brush not only works up the
 lather but also works it in colgates rapid-shave powder
 makes this possible

       it makes as perfect a lather as colgates famous shaving stick and makes it
  by a quicker neater method the fine particles of powder shaken on the wet
  brush are taken up at once by the water no soapy paste forms under the
  lather to clog the pores of the skin or the razor blade

     for cleanliness convenience and comfort rapid-shave powder
 sets a new standard for sanitary shaving

chemists analyses prove its antiseptic effect  to  shaves in each can
