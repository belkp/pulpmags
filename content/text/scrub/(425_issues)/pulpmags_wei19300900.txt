heliodores beads

            by marvin luter hill

                   the beads of crystal talked to me

                  we rested there two thousand years
                  about her throat of ivory

                  and dripping down her breast like tears-
                  the sweet young breasts of heliodore

                   widi her black tresses weighted oer
                   though dead she walked upon the shore
                   we saw her raise her golden eyes
                   to the pale beauty of the skies

                   in sleepy dreams in sleepy dreams

                we saw her dancing on moonbeams
                below the carved balustrade

                   in level light the river swayed-
                   black-amber melting into jade

                  her breath was sweet with ambergris

                    her hair a thick coil of the dusk

                  her garments breathed a winy musk

                  the darkness swooned upon her kiss

                  and then she would come back once more
                  and lie down softly as before

                    the thick years gathered silence lay
                    upon us like an earthy pall

                 we slept and dreamed the years away-
                 slept woke nor could remember all

                  we saw her climb the garden wall

                  her jeweled fingers made a gleam
                  on the black amber of the stream

                   we heard the silver paddles fall

                   as the long boat leaped out she sent
                   it down to where the low waves went
                   in idle lapping one was there
                   who kissed the star-gleams from her eyes
                   and kissed the jewels from her hair

                   as the red moon climbed up the skies

                   the years were bats that beat upon
                   the muffled heart and fragile bone

                  and we dreamed on and on and on

                  and on-until our dreams were stone

the stranger first hove into sight
through the faint coppery haze
of the african dawn his craft
was a native dugout canoe looted we
subsequently discovered from one of the
villages on the coast which lay a line of
pale purple about four miles off our port
beam so feeble were his paddle-strokes
against the set of the inshore current that
it was some time before i realized that
he was heading for our ship it was only
when he stood up waving his tattered
coat that i understood his plight and
rang off the engines to enable a boat to
be lowered

the west coast of africa is not what
you might term a health resort but i had

    

never seen such a physical wreck even
there as the man who was presently
hoisted over the side of my ship fever
he had as a matter of course he was bad-
ly wounded as well and bore signs of
privation which seemed to indicate a long
tramp through the bush yet his bodily
condition desperate though it was
seemed hardly sufficient to account for the
look of agony and horror in his sunken
bloodshot eyes

  where are you heading for cap-
tain were his first words as he reached
the deck

  lagos i answered shortly enough
naturally supposing him to be some
beach-comber down on his luck
he intended the bullet for nzahgi
but he must have aimed badly

  direct he asked

  i shook my head we stop at about
a dozen factories on the way down to take
off trade

  ill make it worth your while to cut
out the trade and head direct for lagos
the stranger said i am lord clen-
garth

  for a moment i thought the man was
indulging in grim satire of course one
meets with some curious examples of hu-
man flotsam on the african seaboard but

that tattered scarecrows claim to be a
member of the british peerage was too
tough to be swallowed offhand

  my steam yacht was wrecked in the
bight some six weeks ago he went on
she struck an uncharted reef and only
one boat managed to get away at pres-
ent i think im the sole survivor ive
had an awful time in the bush captain

an awful time-

  then he cut short the palaver by pitch-
ing forward on the deck-planks in a dead

                                    


weird tales

faint we carried him below and for
the next few days he hovered between
life and death during his intervals of
consciousness he told me his story but
not in exactly the same order as here set
down i had to piece the tale together
from his disjointed utterances and some
of the details he did not divulge until he
realized that he was not going to pull
through here is his story

 suppose that from a theoretical point
of view every soul on board the prim-
rose should have been saved the strang-
er began by stating when she struck
the sea was calm the glass steady and
the land within easy rowing distance if
i had but had the sense to have shipped
white firemen i might have a different
story to tell it was the lascars who
started the trouble they swarmed up
from the stokehold the moment they felt
the yacht take the reef brained the chief
engineer when he attempted to handle
the reversing-gear and then started in to
loot the ship

  we had to hold them back with our
revolvers while we got my niece-the
only lady on board-into the lifeboat it
was well for us that we lost no time in
doing so barely had we got two cables
length from the yacht than the water
reached the undrawn fires exploding the
boilers and sending her to the bottom
like a stone

  kemp the second mate who was in
charge at once put the lifeboat about but
the only man we picked up was so badly
injured that he died before we reached
the shore it was while he was being
lifted into the boat that i discovered that
lady elna was wounded one of the
lascars had flung a knife inflicting a deep
gash in her left shoulder from which the
blood was pouring luckily the ships
surgeon dr tremaine was in the boat
with us he at once set about rendering

first aid but it was clear that an impor-
tant artery had been severed and that the
girls condition was grave

  poor elna the voyage which had end-
ed so tragically had been planned as a
honeymoon trip for she had but recently
been married to young sir leslie fan-
shaw who was also among the survivors

   there were seven of us all told in the
lifeboat the others being the second
mate kemp dr tremaine myself a sa-
loon steward named leon and the in-
jured seaman whose name i never learnt
the craft was by no means overloaded
and we experienced no difficulty in reach-
ing the shore after waiting some time
for a smooth kemp put her head to
the rollers and we flashed through the
broken water toward the beach

  we had almost reached it and i was
just about to congratulate myself on a
safe landing when a sudden shock
seemed to jar every bone in my body
the boat had struck a submerged mass
of coral and the force of the impact had
impaled it so firmly on the sharp up-
standing prongs that the backwash left it
stranded high and dry we had gained
the shore safely but the boat was wrecked
beyond repair

  we carried the now unconscious elna
above the high-water mark and laid her
down in the shade of a tree and kemp
lost no time in making a survey of our
immediate surroundings

  there are several threads of smoke
rising above the bush over yonder he
announced staring through his binocu-
lars its a native village or at least an
encampment of some sort wed better
make for it the coast natives have the
reputation of being fairly peaceable but
you never can be sure of em be on
your guard against treachery but dont
shoot except as a last resort

  it turned out to be the usual type of
coast village of about a hundred beehive
the invisible bond



mud huts with a larger one-the fetish
hut-standing a little apart the natives
seemed friendly enough they brought
us food and gave up two of the huts for
our use they even carried their good
intentions so far as to summon the local
medicine-man to cure elnas wound of
course we had not the slightest intention
of allowing him to praaise his hocus-
pocus on her but i thought it policy to
decline his services in such a way as to
avoid giving offense these witch-doc-
tors have unlimited influence over their
devotees even to matters of life and
death and heaven alone knew how long
we should have to remain there before
we could signal a passing steamer to take
us off

  the moment i caught sight of the
witch-doctor i could tell that he was of
a different race from the rest of the na-
tives it is rarely that you meet a masai
on the coast but this man whose name
was nzahgi had evidently been some-
thing of a traveler according to his own
account he had served on steamships and
had visited europe more than once and
he spoke english quite well it is diffi-
cult to judge the age of a native but i
estimated that he was about thirty-five
he was tall and well built and he evident-
ly possessed unusual bodily strength on
the whole i was rather favorably im-
pressed by the man and i felt that we
were lucky in having fallen in with him
if it had not been for elnas wound my
mind would have been fairly easy but
her condition grew rapidly worse until
two days after our landing dr tremaine
took me aside and proposed a desperate
expedient

   there is only one way of giving your
niece a chance of pulling through he
told me and that is by performing an
operation which is very rarely practised
and then only as a last resort i refer to
the transfusion of blood unless the

blood of some healthy person is con-
veyed into the depleted veins of the
wounded girl she must surely die
somewhat surprized i asked him if
he thought it possible to perform such an
operation

  yes was his confident answer pro-
vided of course that there is someone
willing to give the necessary blood

   if that is your only difficulty you can
get ready now i said i will give
mine

  but the doctor shook his head

   i fear you are rather too old for such
a thing it doesnt pay to play tricks
with the vital fluid of a man on the wrong
side of fifty it would be merely ex-
changing one life for another

  then how about her husband sir
leslie i asked he is young enough
and i know he would volunteer like a
shot

  again the doctor shook his head

  sir leslie is down with fever and as
weak as a kitten he is out of the ques-
tion

  kemp the second mate might be
willing i suggested

   like yourself he is far too old

  i thought for a moment

  then there only remains the steward

leon-

  impossible interrupted dr tre-
maine with a shake of his head that was
more decisive than before that man
is totally unfit for such a thing

  i groaned aloud in my despair

  then the operation can not be per-
formed elna must die

  in the dead silence which followed my
utterance there came a sound of rustling
among the foliage of the fringe of red
aloes near by then the leaves parted and
nzahgi appeared for a moment i
stared at him speechlessly then indigna-
tion took the place of surprize


weird tales

  nzahgi i cried you were hid-
ing-listening-

  and i overheard every word the
masai drew himself up fearless and un-
abashed as he made the cool admission
then he came a pace nearer and laid his
hand on my arm as he went on earnest-
ly but there is no need for the lady
elna to die i nzahgi will save her
in spite of the heaviness of my heart
i laughed aloud

  and how do you propose to set
about it i cried with bitter sarcasm
by muttering your gibberish charms and
sacrificing a chicken or two

  no white man-by giving my own
blood to save her

  you i gasped

  why not he asked the question
with a kind of simple dignity although
my skin is black and hers is white the
blood which flows beneath is the same my
body is strong-not weakened by fever
like the white mans lady elna needs
blood-then take of mine as much as
you will i give it freely that she may
live

  my first impulse was to return a def-
inite refusal every instinct seemed to cry
out against allowing a white girl to have
infused into her veins the blood of a
naked savage dir tremaine must have
guessed what was passing in my mind
for he laid his hand on my shoulder be-
fore i could speak

  after all it is her only chance of
life he said gently

  i tried to force my mind to grapple
with the problem but in vain then
across the black chaos of my indecision
there came a gleam of hope

  sir leslie-her husband-he must de-
cide i cried

  tremaine shook his head gravely

  i fear that he is not in a condition
either to give his consent or withhold it

he said his fever is now at its height
and he is delirious it is you who must
decide and quickly too come what is
your answer

  for a while i stood silent my mind
torn by indecision a vague foreboding of
coming evil in my heart at last i bowed
my head in assent

  let the thing be done i said and
may god forgive me if i have decided
wrong

right from the moment that the oper-

-	ation was completed there seemed to
be no doubt as to its complete success
as i watched the warm color returning
to elnas waxen cheeks i felt my former
vague fears vanishing

  you have saved her life nzahgi
i cried impulsively turning to the witch-
doctor who was standing in the center of
the hut while tremaine fixed a bandage
over the incision in his arm how can
i reward you i will take you to england
-i will make you rich for life

  nzahgi folded his arms across his
massive chest as he shook his head

  i do not want your money white
man nor do i wish to visit your land
again he returned with it seemed a
hint of contempt in his voice

  then how can i repay you i in-
sisted puzzled not a little by his manner

  for a full minute the masai remained
silently pondering then he raised his
head

  soon will i name my reward - and
claim it too till then farewell white
man nzahgi has spoken

  as he quitted the hut he turned and
for a moment his dark eyes rested on the
sleeping girl in a manner i did not like

during the ensuing three weeks we
took it in turns to keep a contin-
uous lookout from the vantage-point of
a little rocky hill near the village but no
the invisible bond



distant plume of smoke on the horizon
rewarded our vigil

   lady elnas condition continued stead-
ily to improve so much so that i more
than once proposed that we should at-
tempt to make our way along the coast in
the hope of reaching accra or some other
town within british territory

   at first the others overruled my ad-
vice but as day followed day with the
circle of the horizon void and empty the
rest gradually began to come round to
my views finally going so far as to con-
sult nzahgi in the hope of his consent-
ing to provide us with guides and bearers
for the journey but the wily savage
counseled delay

  why face the danger and fatigue of
a journey through strange tribes he
said why not stay here in safety and
comfort till a ship passes

  the second mate greeted this advice
with a dubious growl

   thats all very well-provided ships
do occasionally pass near enough to be
sighted he said running his hand
through his gray beard but if the coast
is dangerous we might cool our heels here
forever

   the witch-doctor shrugged his massive
shoulders

   at least you must stay here until the
moon is at its full he said then you
may go

   sir leslie looked at the man sharply
ever since he had learnt the part that
nzahgi had played in his young wifes
recovery leslie had taken a violent dis-
like to the savage

   why must we wait here until it is full
moon he demanded suspiciously

  again nzahgi shrugged

   it is merely one of the superstitions of
the ignorant black man he explained
smoothly they consider it a night of
good omen

  and for the first time since we had

met i noticed that the witch-doctor
smiled

while a few days later tremaine
and i were sitting in our hut he
made a somewhat startling remark

  have you noticed the manner in
which our esteemed devil-doctor has been
behaving lately he began by asking
he seems to be getting too fond of
parading his authority and generally act-
ing the guardian angel over lady elna

i am far from forgetting that he prac-
tically saved the girls life but i dont
like his manner nevertheless if it
werent for the utter absurdity of the
thing id be inclined to say that he has
fallen in love with her

   in spite of the fact that his words con-
firmed my own impressions i tried to
treat the matter lightly

  by the way tremaine went on
did you notice those strange marks on
the fellows chest

   i nodded i thought they were the
scars of old wounds

   you re wrong kemp has traded along
the coast for years and he tells me that
they are the signs of a secret society
called the ghu-fanti otherwise the red
drinkers

   sounds like the name of a russian
boozing club i suggested flippantly

   if what kemp says is true it is far
from being a laughing matter for us
said the doctor gravely he has been
telling me of some of the rites of their
secret and obscure cult i do not wish to
harrow your feelings but i may tell you
that the sacrifice of human victims is one
of the least revolting of their ceremonies
i am not over-squeamish on the subject of
anatomy but some of the things kemp
described nearly made me sick

   probably he was twisting your ankle
-old sailors are adepts at that form of
amusement anyway nzahgis doings


weird tales

will not interest us after the next twenty-
four hours are past i pointed upward
to where a pale yellow light was stealing
through the massive tree trunks and fes-
tooned vines of the jungle nzahgi
has promised that we shall leave here on
the night of the first full moon and un-
less i am out of my reckoning it will be at
its full tomorrow night

  as i spoke the words i became aware
of the deep note of a native drum sound-
ing in the far distance

on the following day i had no soon-
er taken up my post on the little
knoll which served as a lookout post than
i heard a frenzied shout coming from the
direction of the huts

   wheres lady elna i cant find her
anywhere-she has vanished

  i at once left my post and hastened
toward the white-faced and gesticulating
leslie and at the same moment dr tre-
maine and the mate appeared at the door
of the other hut by their bewildered
looks it was evident that his shout had
roused them from their afternoon siesta

   oh theres probably nothing to get
alarmed about said the doctor when he
learnt the cause of the summons she
may have wandered into one of the other
huts he looked toward the village as
he spoke and the words died away on his
lips

  at this time of the day it was cus-
tomary for scores of women to be seated
before the doors of the huts grinding
corn weaving native fiber cloth or busy
at the numerous menial tasks which their
lords deemed it beneath their dignity to
perform but now not one was to be
seen even the naked babies who usually
sprawled in the sun were gone more
significant still the cooking-fires had been
allowed to go out-a most unusual oc-
currence

  why the place is empty kemp

shouted every blamed nigger has slung
his hook whats in the wind now

  in the dead silence which followed
every mans eyes sought and searched his
neighbors face trying to guess his
thoughts not daring to voice his own

   it was the doctor who spoke first i
dont like the look of this at all he
muttered then and wheres the stew-
ard got to

   a single glance was sufficient to show
that he was not in the huts neither did
our loud and repeated shouts cause him
to make his appearance

   come to think of it i havent seen the
fellow since last night said the mate
thoughtfully just as the moon was ris-
ing i saw him come out of his hut and
walk toward the path that leads into
the bush i thought that he like myself
could not sleep because of that infernal
drum-it was sounding all night long
you remember

  yes-and its sounding now inter-
rupted tremaine holding up his hand
listen

   far away deep in the trackless jungle
the savage tom-toms were again lifting
up their weird and tuneless voices one
is apt to get queer ideas in moments of
mental stress to me the barbaric music
seemed the essence and embodiment of
the very soul of africa-fierce mystic
unknowable

  a sudden frightened oath from kemp
roused me from my revery

  theres devils work going on over
there he cried waving his hand toward
the dense woods its the call of the
ghu-fanti that theyre sounding its the
summons of the red drinkers-the in-
vitation to the feast of blood

the memory of our search through
the tunnel-like trails of that steam-
ing jungle remains in my mind like a
hideous nightmare we divided our
the invisible bond



forces kemp and the nearly distraught
leslie taking one direction and the doc-
tor and myself another for a long time
after leaving the others we walked in
silence and when tremaine at last spoke
it was to ask a question

   has it not struck you as being curious
that we did not hear the sound of a strug-
gle or cry when lady elna was carried
off

  i paused in my stride and glanced at
him there seemed some veiled meaning
behind his casual tone

  the poor girl may have been taken
unawares i answered she may have
been drugged-or stunned-

  or she may have gone off of her own
accord he said grimly

  his suggestion appeared so ridiculous
that i did not deem it worthy of an an-
swer and after that we continued our
search in silence but the farther we pen-
etrated the more dense the jungle be-
came the bright sunlight barely managed
to trickle through the interlaced mass of
twisted lianas over the narrow trail on
each side the foliage formed a dense
wall of green in that leafy labyrinth a
week might have been expended in
searching one square mile when at
nightfall we made our way back to the
deserted village i was not surprized to
hear that kemp and leslie had the same
tale of failure to report

  by this time the distress of the young
husband was pitiful to witness it was in
vain that i urged on him the necessity of
taking food and rest

  at least wait till daybreak before
setting out again i almost begged of
him if we could not find her by day-
light what chance have we of doing so
in the dark

  elna-my elna it went to my heart
to hear the hopeless anguish in his voice
cant you realize that shes somewhere

out there-alone-helpless-perhaps a
prisoner god when i think what might
be happening i feel im going crazy i
must go to her-save her eat-food
would choke me sleep-i feel as if i
shall never sleep again i must rescue
her from those devils-i must i tell you
i must

   very well then i answered rising
to my feet and taking up one of the
rifles since you are determined to go
i will go with you as a matter of fact
the boy was in such a state that i dared
not leave him to himself

the rays of the full moon were strug-
gling through the thick foliage as
we plunged almost at random into one
of the jungle trails the night air was
laden with the odor of warm moist
earth the velvety black shadows on each
hand were populous with animal life
vague rustlings and sudden scurryings
sounded ever and again from the dark-
ness and once a sudden loud crashing
told of the blundering retreat of some
larger animal disturbed by our footsteps
farther off the dog-like barking of a
herd of zebras drifted to our ears sinking
into sudden stillness as a lions roar vi-
brated through the air overhead some
night-bird uttered a wail like that of a
tortured soul

  then without warning a sound of
another kind floated out of the mystery
of the african night leslie heard it
first and clutched my arm with a grip
that made me wince

   the drums there was a fierce joy-
ous elation in his voice as he repeated the
words the drums-they will lead us
to her

changing direction we soon had the
satisfaction of hearing the low throbbing
swell louder showing that we were head-
ing directly for the spot whence the sound
continued on page 
the long corridor with its banked
tiers of barbed cells stretched
away before the visitor in a seem-
ingly endless vista from all parts of the
great institution came a medley of sounds
-inarticulate babblings cries shrieks
snatches of insane song and oratory-the
voices of the unfortunate victims of the
great madness thousands were incarcer-
ated in the great asylum millions more
all over the world were raving and curs-
ing in their mad delirium behind the
bars in similar prisons faint though it was
some hope of cure was held by the author-
ities else these inmates would have as had
millions of obviously incurables been
mercifully put to death a stricken world

after the great madness of  had been
    

forced to seek salvation in extreme and
immediate action occasionally even yet
a modern tumbril would roll silently
through the shadowy corridors a door
would clang and another raving victim
would be borne away to the lethal gas
chamber where his hideous cries would
be hushed in everlasting sleep

  and now after two years of heroic
struggling the stout-hearted survivors of
the horror had brought a semblance of
order out of chaos had put back on its
feet a tottering civilization but present-
day historians as they sift the facts and
chronicle the history of those eventful
years often speculate on the effect a
knowledge of the truth would have had
on those battling to save the world for
 in vadin g

madness

hu  r roprv

the truth was that even as they attained
success the dark forces behind the mad-
ness were preparing indeed were almost
ready to strike again and complete their
work of mastering the world with di-
abolical cunning they had prepared this
second attack to follow the first at a time
when the defenders having been deceived
into a false security the complete sur-
prize of it would engender a hopelessness
in the hearts of a tired world sufficiently
overwhelming to cause immediate and
complete surrender again would human
shrieks mingle with the din of the hor-

ror again would human teeth tear
bestially at human flesh and human
bodies float hideously in gutters running
with human blood

the guide conducting the distin-
guished visitor through the great
prison spoke respectfully you have not
visited this floor before sir

   no this is the first time

  we have an interesting case in num-
ber  sir not at all like the others
number  also sir seems perfectly
sane

                                      


weird tales

  the visitors eyes swung sharply
around to his guides and lighted up with
a fierce interest what is this he
cried then controlling his obvious excite-
ment said calmly lead me to them
williams

  yes sir this way sir near the end
of the corridor they are

  a half-hundred steps brought them
opposite cell no 

  ah they already have a visitor sir
the guide nodded to where a comely
young woman stood close to the bars
conversing earnestly with the victim they
imprisoned near by stood another uni-
formed attendant visibly bored by his
duties williams and his distinguished
companion drew back a respectful dis-
tance and waited

  doctor williams said earnestly
dropping his formal manner of address
have you learned nothing yet concern-
ing the cause of the great mad-

  tut tut my boy you know the law
forbids its mention

  to hell with the law the young man
cried vehemently like ostriches with
their heads in the sand they are those
blind fools in authority and while they
impose silence and throttle publicity
seriously handicapping men like you who
are searching for the truth the thing
may come back and finish the job of
wrecking civilization oh yes i know
their reason as the doctor started to in-
terrupt him that to call to mind the
horrors of those days may send others
into insanity and i know their foolish
opinions as to its source radio waves
from a passing inhabited comet-faugh
its silly they were radio waves all
right but they came from somewhere
right here on earth and if that place is

not found-

  patience my boy the doctor inter-
rupted who knows but that the inmates

of cells no  and  yonder may fur-
nish the clue for which we have been
searching

  the young guides ire subsided and
his intelligent features again assumed
their habitually calm expression  perhaps
doctor he agreed quietly they do
say that the younger man tells a strange
story in fact its wildness is what con-
vinced the insanity commission of his
madness no  was also involved
but i have never heard the details

  dr artley ingram one of the great-
est scientists of the age listened thought-
fully to the young mans words he had
his own theories regarding the great
madness but in fear of the results of
presenting his apparently insane ideas to
the world insanity commission kept dis-
creetly silent quietly however using his
high position as president of the united
states central university to the limit of
its obvious advantages he worked under
cover ceaselessly searching to ferret out
the real cause of the terrible catastrophe
that had blighted the minds of half the
human race

  these were trying days from chaos to
order had been a hard fight the gov-
ernments of the world had forgotten old
differences and united solidly in the ef-
fort to save humanity a stria censorship
and system of espionage had been estab-
lished supreme power had been invested
in the suddenly created world insanity
commission for fear of the possible
contagious effects of such utterances the
authorities continued to place behind
bars anyone whose speech hinted even
slightly of a hidden trace of the madness
one had to guard his tongue lest his
liberty be revoked who was to say
whether these drastic measures were wise
or unwise there had been no time for
debate those whose stronger minds had
successfully resisted the horror now

wt-
the invading madness



worked feverishly to bulwark humanity
against a possible recurrent wave of in-
sanity the theory was that like a pin-
hole leak in a dike one insane utterance
might release a second flood of lunacy
humanity in genaral was not interested
so much in the source of the madness
now that it had passed as it was in con-
tagious after-effects

  but there were a few who feared
rather a recurrence of the maddening
phenomenon than its after-effects until
its source was found and assurance given
that the phenomenon could not occur
again they would not cease in their ef-
forts to locate and destroy its cause

  among this small group dr ingram
was probably the most prominent had
this group been permitted to organize and
work in concert no doubt their findings
would have approximated the truth but
the world governments were convinced
that the madness was gone and would
not return until the strange comet re-
garded as its source would return again
on its orbit some hundreds of years hence
meanwhile the task of subduing and im-
prisoning the millions of stricken and in-
sane unfortunates had well-nigh crushed
physically and mentally the fortunate
half of society that had remained sane

   dr ingram believed that somewhere
among the millions of imprisoned insane
there was someone who knew the secret
of the phenomenon searching ever
searching he faced a stupendous task in
attempting to assort and glean a word or
two of useful truth from the insane bab-
blings of the stricken ones it was during
his many visits to the great central asy-
lum of the united states that he became
acquainted with williams whose intelli-
gence and reckless statements of his pos-
itive views had elicited the doctors con-
fidence to williams dr ingram had
confided his theories hopes and plans

-	wt-

and had thereby gained a valuable assist-
ant for williams through his position
as attendant in the great asylum was
qualified to gather information hardly
available to the doctor and now a new
spark of hope flamed in the doctors
heart perhaps this time success   

  suddenly the young woman visitors
voice was raised in anger they looked
quickly down the corridor to where she
stood close to the bars

  i will she cried ill go to them
and force the truth down their throats
to think that you and father discovered
and stopped that awful thing and

now-

  nan stop a voice behind the bars
interrupted you will only make our
chances for release less by thus endanger-
ing your own liberty have patience
sweetheart and keep silent surely it will
not be long before this rigid espionage
law is repealed and the authorities are
willing to listen

  dr ingram clutched williams arm
taking advantage of the girls marked
distress they moved quietly nearer to
miss no word of her conversation with
the prisoner

  but robert she objected in a
strained but lowered tone in the mean-
time what of the operator who escaped
he may build another machine and the
world could not stand another hour of
the horror

  but nan even if he escaped the asy-
lum which is unlikely it would take a
long time to perfect another apparatus
true the thangs will bide their time
and attempt it again but soon no doubt
we will be released and find a way to de-
feat them

dr ingram waited to hear no more
but stepped boldly to the side of
the young woman who paled at his ap-
proach in a low voice he instructed


weird tales

williams to dismiss the other attendant
who nodded at williams whispered
words and stifling a bored yawn strolled
lazily away waiting until he had dis-
appeared through a door at the far end
of the corridor dr ingram then spoke
my dear miss do not be alarmed be-
cause we overheard your conversation
we are your friends then after intro-
ducing williams and himself he went
on from what i inadvertently heard
you say to this young man in the cell i
believe that my search for the secret of
the great madness may be near an end
am i right

  she caught her breath at his bold men-
tion of the forbidden subject then the
prisoner in the cell answered for her to
prevent her committing herself

  yes you are right dr ingram al-
low me to introduce ourselves i am
robert hargrane and this-turning to
the next cell where a white-haired man
of about sixty years peered silently
through the partitioning bars-is pro-
fessor answorth who was my employer
before we were imprisoned he is deaf
a misfortune that was indeed fortunate
for the world as you will see later the
young lady beside you is his daughter and
my fiancee

  the doctor bowed in acknowledgment
of the introduction and said

  you have information regarding this
calamity the great madness that has
overtaken the world

  robert hargrane pressed closer to the
bars and clasped them with strong
hands here is a man the doctor
thought as he noted the clear brown eyes
clean features and magnificent form
capable of wrestling with the psychical
as well as the physical forces of nature
hargrane in turn missed no character-
istics of the doctor the doctors prom-
inence in scientific circles had made him

well known to hargrane but for the
first time he was looking on the eminent
savants distinguished features with
self-possessed composure he met the firm
searching yet kindly gaze of the doctors
steel-gray eyes he approved of the
strong clean-shaven chin and the mobile
mouth that betrayed no cruelty in the
mans nature he was conscious also of
the lean slender form of williams with
his dark eager eagle-like features a
young man typical of this flying age when
adventurous youth took to the air as
though it was youths natural element
and nan his nan there beside them
whose troubled blue eyes reflected the
mental distress she had been suffering
even now had it not been for this
scourge of madness that had whipped the
world to its knees she would be his wife
his heart went out with longing and
sympathy to her sweet face with its full
half-parted lips her slight athletic
form clothed in the neat flying-costume-
helmet jacket breeches and puttees
youths sporting-mode of the day - re-
minded him of some artemis of the air

   and there was the slight but yet active
form of the man in the next cell whom
he loved as a father the studious blue
eyes behind the spectacles were now
troubled as they watched roberts lips
form his answer to the doctor robert
knew that his frail form would soon
break under the strain of imprisonment
and a prayer was in his heart that here
at last was someone who would listen
believe and help them a black menace
hung over the world that they alone un-
derstood so he answered

  doctor we have a story to tell that
will tax your credulity to the utmost but
if the world is to be saved you or some-
one must listen-and believe

  oh please please doctor nan
broke in you must believe it
the invading madness



  the doctor produced notebook and
pencil i am ready to listen he said
quietly

  i am sorry doctor hargrane said
but it is too complicated to tell here if
you can effect our release i can take you
to where absolute proof will be given
you

  hm the doctor thoughtfully
stroked his chin the task of cutting
the tangle of red tape would be insur-
mountable

  turning to williams he continued
would you risk the danger of assisting
in their escape

  gladly doctor

  then let us arrange the details but
first mr hargrane i would like to ask
you just one question just who are the
-er the thangs

  robert hargrane hesitated and
searched the eyes of dr ingram for signs
of insincerity what he found there sat-
isfied him and he answered firmly

  the thangs sir are the malignant in-
habitants of another dimension another
plane very near and very dangerous to
the world

midnight now and then the silence
brooding over the great darkened
asylum was broken by the insane gibber-
ings of some mentally tortured victim
confined behind its grim walls evoking
a chorus of nocturnal wailings from
others gradually the hideous mouthings
would subside then quiet again

  through the dim light a lone figure
sped down one of the long corridors
the man paused before a barred door a
lode clicked and he was joined by a shad-
owy form from within a cell another lock
grated and another form emerged a win-
dow at the end of the corridor was softly
raised the loosened bars removed and the
darkness without received the trio in its
protecting embrace in a few moments

in a field close by a soft purring sound
accelerated into a muffled hum and a
dark bird-like form glided swiftly over
the turf rose into the air circled then
was lost to sight in the black void above

dr ingram surveyed with much in-
terest the room into which he had
been shown

  your father has a wonderfully
equipped laboratory here miss ans-
worth

  yes doctor he has spent a lifetime
and a fortune in accumulating the equip-
ment you see miss answorth answered
and since mother died he fitted up
living-quarters adjoining having the
entire top floor to ourselves and the ex-
clusive use of the roof as a landing-stage
has given us a privacy that he valued
highly having given up all work of a
public nature and devoting his entire
time to private research and experimen-
tation father has caused us to be as alone
up here as if we were in a desert mr
hargrane his sole assistant for the past
two years lived with us we kept two
planes one for myself and one in which
father and mr hargrane made frequent
flights to remote places in the interests of
his many experiments since fathers
and roberts-mr hargranes-incar-
ceration i have continued to live here 
alone hoping against hope that their re-
lease might be effected i am so grateful
to you doctor for your assistance in their
escape and in a short time you will have
revealed to you amazing things that will
elevate that favor into an act that may
save the world there she said point-
ing is the most wonderful invention in
all history-the medium through which
those amazing things will be revealed its
conception and construction were the sal-
vation of the world once and may be
again

  dr ingram looked in the direction in-


weird tales

dicated and beheld a complicated appa-
ratus that was mostly concealed by a
draped black cover

  tell me about it he said

  if you will pardon me i would rather
let father and robert explain it they
will be here shortly and do you not think
a warm lunch after their asylum fare
would be welcome

  by all means miss answorth he
smiled it takes a woman to remember
all the little niceties doesnt it

  he followed her into the kitchen and
watched her prepare coffee eggs bacon
and a salad and dessert for the escaping
prisoners whom they expected within the
hour

  dr ingram glanced at his watch
they should be here in fifteen minutes
or so he said then a disquieting
thought struck him will not the aerial
police see the landing-lights and possibly
investigate

  she smiled

  fathers genius has taken care of that
doctor he has the landing-stage out-
lined in black-violet signals-his own
and hitherto secret invention which is
an adaptation from the well-known black-
light searchlights a special receiving-
apparatus is installed on both our planes
giving them the exclusive ability to re-
ceive the signals to all others in the
sky our roof is as dark as the night itself
robert can easily show mr williams
how to operate it in case mr williams
acts as pilot on the return flight oh i
do hope nothing goes wrong she cried
as sudden fright at possible failure star-
tled her

  do not worry miss answorth dr
ingram assured her mr williams is a
very capable young man trustworthy as
well as an excellent pilot i see no pos-
sibility of failure it simplified matters a
great deal for you to furnish a plane in

which he could spirit them away from
the asylum it would be a simple matter
for him an attendant to enter the place
at any time unlock the cells and conduct
your father and hargrane to the plane
she smiled her gratitude for his com-
forting words then-

  listen she exclaimed

  a faint humming sound from above
came to their ears and at a slight jar
overhead she cried oh good they are
here

  in a very few minutes nan answorth
sobbing with joy was locked in the em-
braces of her father and lover then
with tears in her eyes she thanked wil-
liams and led the little party in to the
midnight repast

seated at a large table in the labora-
tory with professor answorth his
daughter and robert hargrane dr in-
gram and williams prepared to hear the
true story of the great madness and gain
understanding of that which was to come

  professor answorth has been deaf
and mute for a number of years doctor
hargrane began but you shall hear his
story in his own words for he is an ex-
pert in lip-reading and has taught it to
miss answorth and me so that commu-
nication between him and us would be
simplified he will speak silently of
course and i will translate to you his
words after he is through you may see
if you wish with your own eyes the
malignant entities or intelligences in their
evil dimension

  hargrane turned to professor ans-
worth who had been watching his lips
as he talked the professors lips moved
as he silently conveyed some comment to
his assistant facing dr ingram with a
dignified bow and quiet smile his lips
again moved and hargrane immediately
began to speak aloud the words his
the invading madness



mouth was forming-the words that de-
scribed to dr ingram the most astonish-
ing discovery in history and the awful
danger that menaced the world

  i wish to thank you doctor he be-
gan for your timely assistance in our
release your aid in effecting our es-
cape is i have every reason to believe
an act that will save the world from a
recurrence of the horror and its resultant
collapse of sanity and civilization your
mind can not conceive now the awful
menace that surrounds humanity in the
persons of the inhabitants of the fourth
dimension but in a few moments you
will be privileged to look with your own
eyes into that dimension and behold the
malignant beings who plan to invade
ours

   it was not the fault of those evil en-
tities or intelligences that their first at-
tempt to subdue our diree-dimensional
plane was a failure it was due to our
timely discovery of them and their dia-
bolical plot and the bravery of rob-

  the professor looked at robert who
blushed with modesty but continued
speaking aloud the words the professors
lips were forming

  -who took his life in his hands

when he smashed the infernal machine
that was broadcasting the madness it
is our greatest worry that the inventor
and operator of the machine the tool of
the thangs escaped even now he may
have another almost perfected almost
ready to release another deluge of din
through the ether that would be certain
within a few hours to reduce the rest of
humanity to snarling tearing beasts or
gibbering idiots you being on a soli-
tary hunting-trip in the wilds were mer-
cifully spared the awful spectacle we be-
held here in the city at the first invasion
of the madness of course the din as-

sailed your ears as it did those of every
human your well-balanced mind re-
sisted the madness but even you must
have succumbed had we not found and
destroyed its cause no doubt you in
your lonely bivouac at night watched
the gorgeous display of the strange comet
that then flamed in the sky i wonder
if you too thrilling to the strange un-
earthly music that pervaded the fether
preceding the madness attributed it as
did other scientists to the supposed in-
habitants of that mysterious celestial vis-
itor

  ah how people here in the city were
affected by that music a fervor ap-
proaching fanaticism seized the relig-
iously inclined who watched the skies
eagerly for descending angels from heav-
en playing on golden harps musicians
vainly strove to identify or classify in-
struments the like of which they had
never heard scientists listened awed by
the music and by the ingenuity of the
supposect inhabitants of the comet who
so they thought had accomplished the
double miracle of interplanetary com-
munication and the broadcasting of radio
waves without other receiving-apparatus
than the human ear all over the world
it was heard all over the world the
newspapers were filled with accounts of
the phenomenon and then when the
wonderful music ceased and the awful
din of the horror took its place full real-
ization of its significance came to robert
and me the mysterious activities of the
strange inhabitants of the fourth dimen-
sion into which we had looked through
yonder machine were mysterious no
longer

  i know you are impatient doctor to
see for yourself the beings responsible
for the great madness so i will not go
into a long scientific discussion of the ap-
paratus i invented there has been a


weird tales

great deal of theorizing in scientific cir-
cles regarding the fourth dimension and
also apart from that theoretical state
the possibility of life in or on other
planes of existence i believed that the
conditions termed planes and dimensions
were synonymous i believed that they
were simply states wherein all matter vi-
brated at a different rate than in ours
rendering it invisible and intangible to
our sight and touch considering light
rays in those other planes as matter
theoretically it should be possible there-
fore to see into those planes provided
that the light rays emanating from ob-
jects in those planes could be changed in
their vibrations to conform to the rate of
vibration of our light rays the prob-
lem was how to do it an account of
the thousands of experiments i failed in
would be discouraging reading but fi-
nally it was done i succeeded in devel-
oping a new ray which when directed
across ones line of vision a certain exact
distance from the retina would change
the vibrations of the light rays from the
fourth dimension to the point where they
would be visible to us

  professor answorths lips ceased mov-
ing and robert was silent the profes-
sor moved to the shrouded apparatus he
had indicated and removed the cover
robert followed him and stood beside
the machine which dr ingram exam-
ined with interest he saw a black box-
like affair standing on nickeled tubular
legs with a seat attached at a height suf-
ficient to bring the users face even with
an oval aperture in a rubber curtain
stretched over that side of the box
fixed one on each side were two tubes
pitched at an angle that would direct the
axis of each to a common crossing a few
inches in front of the eyes of the user
an adjustable head-rest with a grad-
uated scale extended down from die top

of the apparatus to govern the distance
of the eyes from the crossing of the axes
of the tubes at the open end of which
were fastened glass spheres connected by
wires to a glittering array of dials and
switches on a panel at one side of the
machine the spheres glowed with a pe-
culiar orange light as the professor
threw in switches and regulated rheostats
on the panel the whole affair includ-
ing a seat for the operator stood on a
circular platform set flush with the floor
so that it could be revolved and fixed in
any certain position

robert seated himself before the ma-
 chine turing to dr ingram he
said i will now demonstrate the using
of the machine doctor and see that it
is in the proper adjustment for you in
case you care to look at the awful entities
in the next dimension

  he turned and thrust his face into the
aperture in the rubber curtain professor
answorth lowered the graduated scale
and carefully scanning it adjusted the
head-rest slowly turning a rheostat he
caused the glass spheres to glow brighter
and brighter with die orange light until
robert with his fingers signaled in old
style deaf-mute language to revolve the
platform the professor pressed a but-
ton and it circled slowly a foot or two
to the left at another signal from
robert he released his pressure on the
control and the platform came to rest
after a few moments robert withdrew
his head from the machine a grim
look was on his features

  they are there he said and evi-
dently in a state of great agitation i
fear they are nearer ready than i thought
for a second attack ugh he shud-
dered i cant get used to looking on
their hideousness do you care to see
them doctor

  this was what he had come for this
the invading madness



was why he had assisted these men to
escape from confinement to see for him-
self the strange things in another dimen-
sion who they had asserted had attempt-
ed once and were preparing even now to
conquer the world through madness
only a moment dr ingram hesitated
and then with a queer trembly feeling
inside his breast he sat down before the
machine and thrust his face through the
opening in the rubber curtain he felt
the head-rest moved against the back of
his head which was gently forced for-
ward into the proper position all was
dark before his eyes at first then a faint
orange glow seemed to spread and slowly
absorb the blackness what monstrous
sight was he about to see

  for two minutes he remained quietly
seated while vague shapes writhed and
slowly took form before his eyes sud-
denly the group around the madiine saw
him shudder saw his body tense and
tremble in a moment he withdrew his
blanched face from the machine and rose
drunkenly from the seat he turned
and faced them his eyes mirroring un-
speakable horror

  my god he exclaimed my god
heads heads bloated leering bodiless
heads floating swaying in a sickening
orange atmosphere-peering and mouth-
ing at me with their evil eyes and foul
lips-shrinking and swelling into lop-
sided loathsome shapes like the rotting
maggot-quickened boneless heads of
corpses and their thoughts-their ob-
scene bestial thoughts pouring into my
brain from their vicious intelligences in
a soul-staining corrupting stream in
heavens name professor what are they

   dr ingram sank into a chair mopping
with trembling hand his streaming brow

  the professors lips moved and rob-
ert spoke for him

   exactly doctor heads the thangs

inhabitants of another dimension which
i have every reason to believe is nothing
less than the traditional orthodox hell
that the old-time fundamentalist clergy
warned us against it was a blind be-
lief but apparently true at least the
awful beings you saw are tortured tor-
tured by an everlasting fire-the consum-
ing flames of unsatisfied passions and de-
sires

  robert with a motioning hand inter-
rupted the professor his lips moved
in a silent request and the professor
nodded robert sat down on the seat of
the machine and turning requested of
nan that she continue the professors
story for him i would like he add-
ed addressing the doctor to be study-
ing the thangs i fear the time is lim-
ited in which to discover something of
their plans

  certainly robert go right ahead
the doctor feebly smiled i think miss
answorth will be a very satisfactory sub-
stitute interpreter

  robert nodded his thanks and turned
to the machine accidentally jostling it
with his elbow neither he nor the pro-
fessor seemed to notice this small acci-
dent he thrust his face into the aper-
ture the professor adjusted the controls
and turned on the current at a signal
from robert that focus and position were
satisfactory he turned from the dials and
switches on the panel and facing the
doctor prepared to resume his story his
lips moved and nans well-bred sweet-
ly quiet voice continued his amazing rev-
elations

  months of study she began watch-
ing her fathers lips after the perfec-
tion of the machine and recovery from
the shock at the awful beings it revealed
convinced robert and me that the
thangs as we soon learned they call
themselves are simply disembodied in-


weird tales

telligences evil beyond compare sev-
eral facts became plain first they dis-
played all the characteristics of the hu-
man intelligence without however any-
thing at all of the good or pure in their
thoughts second we were partly able
to read their minds their wicked thoughts
seemed to come to us over the altered
light rays that revealed them to us third
doing so we knew they hated us were
jealous of us and planned to invade our
dimension how they intended doing
this and what form that invasion could
possibly take we could not learn fourth
we found they were constantly tortured
by consuming passions and desires com-
mon to us humans but usually controlled
by moral forces and instincts having
no morality to restrain them nor a physi-
cal body as a vehicle or outlet for those
passions their madness was understand-
able fifth we concluded that their ori-
gin was in our world our dimension
they were the souls of dead men and
women after death their souls had
lacked the buoyancy of good or morals
to raise them to a higher plane of exist-
ence and there inexorably they were
doomed to stay forever in their hellish
sphere this dovetailed with the ortho-
dox belief in eternal damnation

  so we gave little thought to the pos-
sibility of their success in really invading
our dimension but ascribed their evident
but vague plans thereof to merely the
wish being father to the thought we
could see no way they could accomplish
this unthinkable thing it simply could
not be done ah how much suffering
we might have averted how many minds
and lives we might have saved had we
but perceived the simple truth

  for some months before the horror
of the madness overwhelmed the earth
we had been paying little attention to the
thangs and their activities the study-

ing of them was not pleasant and also
seemingly profitless so we directed our
efforts along other lines of scientific re-
search our main interest lay in perfect-
ing an apparatus which would indicate
exactly the location of the source of any
known electrical impulse it was an
elaboration and perfection of the old ra-
dio direction and distance finder the
task was not so difficult and after thor-
oughly testing and proving our theories
we built a finished machine it was
while we were clearing a place for it in
a corner filled with old bottles of chem-
icals discarded paraphernalia and so on
that i came across a bottle of solution
that i had made several years ago i had
compounded it in experimenting to find
a cure for my increasing deafness how
it had frightened me when its applica-
tion rendered me totally deaf but its
action proved only temporary and harm-
less some unexplainable impulse pre-
vented me throwing it out and there it
had remained dusty and undisturbed all
these years in the meantime failing to
find a cure i had become totally deaf
and mute and reconciled to that state

  as i turned to set the bottle on a
table i noticed nan and robert pause
in their work and listen with rapt inter-
est to something i of course could not
hear and then trying to read both
pairs of lips at once i was excitedly told
of the wonderful music they were hear-
ing-music that seemed to come from
nowhere filling the ether until it seemed
to originate in the brain itself

  we suspended all work as we dis-
cussed this phenomenon someone had
performed a miracle had accomplished
the impossible in transmitting radio
waves direct to the ear without the me-
dium of a mechanical receiver the
name of a new hero of science would
soon headline the newspapers we would
the invading madness



write him whoever he might be a letter
of congratulation when he became
known meanwhile we attempted to lo-
cate him with our new machine but the
hitherto unknown wave-length he used
prevented its successful operation with-
out several minor changes

   of course you heard all that night
the next day and the next night the
strange music that thrilled a mystified
world you know of how it interefered
with communication prevented sleep
except among the totally deaf and al-
most halted business the newspapers
quoted the baffled radio experts as say-
ing that discovery of the unknown broad-
caster was an impossibility he simply
was not on this earth on the morning
of the fatal day of the horror the papers
published the expressed theories of a
group of eminent scientists and astron-
omers which were that the strange new
comet then streaking across the zenith
was inhabited and that the weird music
was radioed by the superior beings there-
on it was not the first time that wise
men had been mistaken as they certainly
were

  that morning nan and robert were
standing at the window watching the ex-
cited human stream in the street below
i saw them simultaneously clap their
hands to their ears and quickly turn to
me consternation and horror in their
eyes breathlessly they told me what had
occurred the music had ceased and in
its place had come the din of the horrox
how terrible it was you already know

  their nerves were soon racked and
frayed under the strain of the awful
noise suddenly nan exclaimed father
if this does not stop soon we shall all
go mad

  mad-there was the key to the mys-
terious activities of the thangs why
had  not thought of it before it was
all plain to me now a clear perception

of their plan flashed into my mind in-
sanity-that was it the deranged hu-
man intellect vibrating at a rate out of
the normal formed a bridge a connecting
link and over that bridge would pour
the thangs out of their foul dimension
to take possession of the minds and bod-
ies of humanity and indulge-if only
fox a brief time-their bestial passions
they had nothing to lose and all to gain

  but how were they producing the
phenomenon of the horror there was
but one logical conclusion a thang pos-
sibly the soul of some mad genius of the
past had entered the -diseased mind of
some once-brilliant modern scientist and
with diabolical cunning the combined in-
tellects had conceived their hellish inven-
tion and had produced a machine to
broadcast the exciting music and then
the maddening noise

  if the world was to be saved imme-
diate action was necessary i needed
help but nan and robert were fast go-
ing to pieces under the strain would
they soon be raving maniacs their minds
possessed by thangs i shuddered at
the thought if only they were deaf too
then i thought of the drug that had tem-
porarily paralyzed my hearing gladly
they consented to a drop in each ear
the action was immediate the relief be-
yond words

  frantically we set to work after a
brief inspection of the thangs through
the machine which showed them in a
state of great excitement vanishing one
by one here and there as they crossed the
bridge of insanity to possess the minds
of those going mad we began the neces-
sary changes in our radio-finding appara-
tus i breathed a prayer that we fail
not to find the source of that nerve-shat-
tering noise we succeeded the indica-
tor showing its location in a sheltered
cove on the eastern shore of georgian
bay in ontario of our flight there and


weird tales

the subsequent fight with the mad inven-
tor of the horrible machine and the burn-
ing of the ship it was on i will ask rob-
ert to tell you as he was the principal
actor in that part of the drama

the professors lips ceased to move
and nan fell silent he turned to
where robert had remained quietly seat-
ed at the machine during his story and
touched him on the arm he did not
move

  again the professor touched him took
hold of an elbow and gently shook it
unresponsive robert sat lifeless his face
hidden in the machine

  the professor now thoroughly
alarmed turned his white face to the
panel board and shut off the current
the doctor and williams were already
lifting robert from the seat and as nan
caught sight of his set features and star-
ing eyes she stifled a scream pressing
her hands to her heart which seemed to
stand still her mind fought back a sin-
gle stabbing word dead

  but no supported by the doctor and
williams robert walked as one hypno-
tized to a couch where every effort to
revive him failed for hours the doctor
worked over the unconscious man
frankly puzzled by his strange condition
silently tensely the little group watched
as he brought into play all his skill and
all his knowledge of medicine and hyp-
nosis though the rest of his physical
organs functioned properly roberts
mind slept he remained as though dead

  it was williams who finally advanced
a theory as to his true condition doubt-
fully hesitantly conscious of his igno-
rance in such matters he said

could he-could the machine have
been out of adjustment and-and drawn
his mind into-into that other dimen-
sion i saw him jar it as he sat down
the professor caught the words on his

lips and a startled look came over his
worry-strained features he pressed
williams arm in a gesture that spoke
plainer than words his thanks for the
suggestion and sprang quickly to exam-
ine the machine nan followed him un-
consciously speaking aloud in her anxiety
as she plied her deaf father with ques-
tions intent on measuring calibrating
and calculating he ignored her then
with pencil and pad he rapidly covered
a half-dozen pages with mathematical
equations finally turning to his anxious
watchers his lips moved and nan inter-
preted

  yes it is possible i did not foresee
it but it is possible the axes of the ray
tubes which were jarred from their nor-
mal forty-five degree pitch while not af-
fecting the ability of the user to receive
on the retina the light rays from the other
dimension set up a rotary motion of the
atoms of the rays that acted as a vortex
drawing roberts intelligence into that
abominable plane

  father nan cried let me see
set the machine again father and let me
see if he is there

  the professor hurriedly readjusted the
machine and nan quickly sat down be-
fore it imploring her father to turn on
the current low moans escaped her as
she contemplated the awful torturing
situation in which she would see her
lover lost was he lost to her for-
ever doomed to stay in that dread place
while his living yet dead body remained
on earth a silent unresponsive reminder
of their love

  her face hidden in the machine they
heard her muffled voice exclaim

  robert oh robert yes he is
there his face white among their black
loathsome heads the agony the pain
in his dear features-robert-oh-h-h

  her voice tapered off in a grief-filled
sob as they lifted her from the seat and
the invading madness



carried her half fainting to her room
dr ingram administered restoratives
and soon she became quieter

  the men gathered around the uncon-
scious robert to discuss the situation and
find a way if possible to reclaim his in-
telligence from the evil domain of the
thangs

  the professor with pitiable eyes
watched the doctors lips as he talked
soothing encouraging and suggesting
professor he said if a condition can
be produced in the rays that would
create a vortex drawing ones intelligence
into that other dimension why can not
the angles of the ray tubes be reversed
so that the vortical action will also be
reversed drawing from the other dimen-
sion into this

  we can try it i will reset the ma-
chine accordingly the professor wrote
the words rapidly on a pad he turned
and hastened to the machine

  nan re-entered the room her face
tear-stained but composed and the doc-
tor explained the experiment they were
about to attempt

  we will place his body again before
the machine just as it was the doctor
explained and trust in god that he will
be restored to us

  it must not fail nan said with
grim determination in her eyes and if
soul can call to soul if the human will
has any power if love can triumph over
evil then he shall return to us for i
shall stand behind him and call to him
with all my soul all my will all my
love

  the doctor bowed as if in homage to
this display of powerful and sacred emo-
tion and at a nod from the professor
that he was ready prepared with the as-
sistance of williams to lead the uncon-
scious robert to the machine

  dawn had come long since and now
the sun was staring through die window

at the drawn faces of the little group of
haggard actors in the strange drama
far below them in the canyon of the
street the city had come to life and its
human swarm hummed in a myriad tones
in the beginning of the days activities
all unconscious of the fact that even
then their fate and the fate of like
swarms the world over lay squarely and
solely in the hands of five people in a
room high above their heads

dr ingram placed his hands under
roberts shoulders and raised him
to a sitting posture with williams op-
posite they prepared to lift the staring
man and guide him to the seat before
the machine they had him half-way to
his feet when-

  cra-a-a-a-a-a-sh

  one long continuous endless detona-
tion of sound burst on their hearing
hands pressed tightly to ears failed to
shut out the stream of hammering noise
that beat on the brain like the stream
from a fire-hose they looked at each
other in horror the madness had come
again the madness the horror
god

  after the first crashing shock their
senses could detea and separate tones
and notes of the roaring cataraa of hid-
eous discordant clamor an intermin-
gling of vibrations ran the scale from
vanishing-point below to that above
the tintinnabulation of unmusical gongs
strove for recognition with the shrieks
wails hoots and thuds of every noise de-
vice conceivable the throb of drums
the beeps and klaxonings of signal
horns the clatter and clap of thunderous
armament threaded with shrill screaming
as from souls in torment the clang and
peal of crashing bells the clank and rat-
tle of dragging chains the moaning la-
ment of deep-throated whistles the trum-
peting and howling of wild beasts static


weird tales

cracklings cries groans explosions a
confusion of incoherent babble - all
commingling in a heterogeneous bedlam
of noise that beat and tortured the audi-
tory nerve until the mind reeled

  the professor though he was immune
knew instantly from the look of horror
on the others faces what had happened
running he procured the bottle of pre-
cious drug and in a few moments all had
been relieved from the nerve-shaking
effect of the awful din

  for the time being they must forget
robert the authorities police officials
public officials all who could be reached
must be saved there must be vials
found and charged with a few drops of
the drug they must be wrapped in cot-
ton labeled and dropped from their
plane on the landing-stages of the police
station the city hall the military bar-
racks and the government buildings
they must sacrifice their immediate per-
sonal interests for the benefit of society
for they knew not how soon the source
of the horror could be discovered and
destroyed the attempt to restore rob-
ert must wait

  calm now in the face of disaster they
all set feverishly to work nan typed
dozens of slips bearing the words

  a drop in each ear for the horror

  a drop in each ear for the horror

  a drop in each ear for the horror

  faces lit by the weird orange glow
from the spheres on the machine which
the professor had prepared for the restor-
ing of robert and had not bothered to
turn off they madly filled wrapped and
labeled the vials counting on the des-
peration of the finders to follow the di-
rections soon they were through the
drug was all used nan volunteered to
distribute them and rushed to the roof
a basket filled with the mind-saving vials
on her arm in a few minutes her plane
was dipping and soaring over the heads

of a crazed populace battling futilely the
maddening stream of reason-wrecking
noise

  back in the laboratory the professor
worked over the radio-detecting appara-
tus something was wrong it would not
operate he needed roberts help but
robert-where was he his body sat
stonily on the couch but his mind was
in that evil domain whence was pouring
the loathsome stream of damnable enti-
ties that were even now taking possession
of the minds of men and engaging in a
wild orgy of debauchery with their bod-
ies

  williams was assisting the professor
as best he could but the doctor unable
to help with the apparatus stood at the
window fascinated by the scene in the
street below

  people were rushing here and there
throwing arms wildly about praying
shouting rapidly succumbing to this sec-
ond attack of the madness try as they
had they had not forgotten the awful-
ness of the former attack came clearly
to their minds and thus weakened re-
sistance to the horror hopelessness
seized them there was no comet now to
blame for the din what could save the
world god had deserted it and hell
had taken charge

  hundreds took the easiest way out
preferring death to madness dr in-
gram saw their bodies hurtling to the
pavement from windows of offices above
individual acts of hideousness caught his
attention as the holocaust of insanity con-
sumed human reason a woman with a
baby clasped to her breast had been
kneeling in the gutter her face upturned
in fervent supplication suddenly she
sprang up caught the infant by the feet
and dashed out its brains against a pole
a surface car the motorman leaning
from the window as he gesticulated and
grimaced in maniacal glee careened at
the invading madness



high speed down the street to crash into
the rear of another bloodstained mu-
tilated passengers crawled from the
wreck and ignoring hideous wounds
fought or danced or committed acts of
indecency as the thangs that possessed
their brains directed

   fire broke out in a dozen places auto-
mobiles ran recklessly over people down
the sidewalk through plate-glass win-
dows until their mad rush was stopped
by some immovable object a group of
men and women their arms about one
anothers half-naked bodies emerged
from a doorway and milling about danc-
ing in a dervish frenzy swept screaming
down the street to be blotted out by a
huge passenger plane that crashed flam-
ing from the sky

  a world gone mad civilization tot-
tering humanity destroying itself in an
awful whirlpool of insanity that was
what dr ingram was witnessing scenes
past description debauchery and obscen-
ity unspeakable murder and rapine an
inferno of human passions rampant on
the face of the world a hideous de-
lirium in which the black entities from
hell took possession of mans mind
god and this was occurring in every
city in every country on the face of a
once fair globe

  sickened he turned from the window
to where the professor and williams
sweated over the radio-detector they
had certain changes almost complete the
professor had discovered the strange new
wave length the thangs were using and
the machine would be ready soon

the doctor nervously paced the floor
pausing now and then to feel rob-
erts pulse whose cataleptic state re-
mained unchanged irresistibly he was
drawn again and again to the window
there was a little less confusion now
the street was filled with dead and

wreckage there were fewer to indulge
in the wild orgy of madness but the
scene was yet terrible beyond words con-
tinuous fighting and self-destruction was
constantly swelling the crimson flood in
the gutters choked with torn and naked
bodies

  suddenly his heart leaped with hope
down the street came an orderly body of
police their calm and sure actions as
they commenced the work of overpower-
ing the insane betokening nans success
in placing the vials of the drug where it
was needed a body of soldiers swung
around another corner adopting drastic
measures in an attempt to save this little
spot of civilization dispatching the badly
wounded and executing the hopelessly
mad perhaps there was hope perhaps
in places there were strong-minded
strong-willed men and women still re-
sisting the maddening din now if they
could locate and destroy the demon in
human form and his hellish machine-

  at that moment nan returned white-
faced she crossed the room as in a daze
and collapsed across the kneees of her
lover who sat as they had left him star-
ing-staring-at nothing dr ingram
approached to offer encouraging words
but with face hidden against roberts
hands she shook her head and waved
him away he honored her desire to be
alone for the present her work was done

  the doctor turned to where the pro-
fessor and williams still labored at the
device to which they pinned their hopes
of saving a disintegrating society he
saw the professor straighten his bent old
form a look of triumph in his eyes he
turned and motioned excitedly to the doc-
tor who sprang to his side williams
was gazing fascinated at the wonder of
the professors accomplishment at a glass
sphere inside it suspended on a thin
wire was a needle that wavered hesi-
tated then pointed straight down the


weird tales

professor wrote rapidly on a pad and the
doctor read the startling words

  that devil machine is in the base-
ment of this very building

  dr ingram showed the pad to nan
who nodded disinterestedly and again
bowed her head on roberts knee in si-
lent grief

  quickly the three men prepared to in-
vade the basement to search for the room
in which was hidden the maniac with his
inconceivable device that continued to
send out through the ether the hideous
maddening cyclone of clamor here no
doubt he had built a duplicate machine
along with the first one that had so near-
ly wrecked the world with insane cun-
ning the tool of the thangs had pre-
pared the second attack against the possi-
ble failure of the first and had boldly
located his diabolical instrument close to
where he could the sooner enjoy the fruits
of their mad plan to say that he would
defend it with all the maniacal fury of a
leader of his foul brood would be putting
it mildly indeed they were entering
on a dangerous mission

  the professor produced strange-look-
ing automatic pistols-terrible weapons
children of his prolific inventive mind-
and they descended the stairs adequate-
ly armed though they were none of them
was of the fighting type and two were
old well past the age when mans heart
thrills to the excitement of combat

   but bravely they traversed the deserted
corridors and crept down the silent steps
the elevators had ceased running hours
ago the operators flinging themselves
into that maelstrom of madness in the
streets deserted open offices spoke
mutely of the tragedy that had engulfed
their occupants but here and there
through an open door they caught a
glimpse of a still figure sprawled at a
desk or on the floor clutching in a stiffen-

ing hand the grim weapon that had
meant a way out

  the basement reached they cautiously
explored its silent corridors here was
the power room here lockers storage
rooms filled with discarded shelving
store fixtures and so on here a shop for
the maintenance of the machinery in the
big building through it all they
searched fruitlessly fingers clenched
around ready weapons they found no
sign of the hidden source of the horror
until before them yawned the darkened
steps to the sub-basement

  below in the gloom each thought they
caught a glimpse of a dim skulking form
but a beam from a flashlight in the hand
of williams revealed nothing was it
imagination slowly descending the
steps the silent trio-williams first then
the doctor and professor-continued the
search nothing save some silent ma-
chinery piles of piping and cobwebbed
abutments met their eyes advancing
farther into the yawning darkness the
ray of light fell suddenly on the outlines
of a door set in the concrete wall at the
rear williams signaled for silence and
extinguished the light then through
the blackness gleamed a yellow streak
from under the door each instinctively
knew they were near the end of their
search and caught their breaths at the
dangerous task before them

   slowly silently they crept closer to the
closed door surely behind it must lie
that which they must risk their lives to
destroy for all other possibilities had
been exhausted and each had supreme
faith in the accuracy of the professors
device which had indicated this basement
as the source of the nerve-shattering
noise

  williams cautiously advancing in the
darkness with the doctor and professor
close behind felt his outstretched fin-
gers come in contact with the concrete
the invading madness



wall the faint yellow light from under
the door guided him to it and kneeling
he peered through the keyhole he saw
a limited section of a well-lighted room
but within range of his vision was
enough paraphernalia of an electrical na-
ture to convince him that he was at the
door to the den of the maniac-the mad
thang-possessed inventor of the device
that was wrecking the world

  cautiously he tried the knob the
door was unlocked and snapping on the
flashlight for a second he signaled with
a nod that they could enter gathering
all the nerve at his command williams
flung open the door and the three with
hearts thumping but with weapons held
desperately ready sprang into the room

  nothing happened no one was in
sight

for a moment they stood quietly wait-
ing for their eyes to become accus-
tomed to the light and then they won-
deringly surveyed the room so large an
array of glittering apparatus was before
them that its separate parts did not im-
mediately register on their senses three
features however caught and held their
attention there was the ceiling from
which was hung on insulated supports a
huge network of wires that was unques-
tionably an aerial for the broadcasting of
wireless signals there in a corner was
a large switchboard with its shining
rows of switches and meters and rheo-
stats above the rubber mat that covered
the floor before the switchboard hanging
at a height slightly above their heads was
a bank of huge coils joined at the bottom
by a thick steel plate and there to one
side was the monstrous madly working
device that plainly was the object of
their search

  but where was the mad creator and
operator of this collection of electrical
and mechanical monstrosities again

they carefully scanned the room as
crowded as it was they could see no place
where one could hide ah no doubt the
madman was out in the streets blood-
thirstily taking part in the hideous orgy
that a maddened world had been plunged
into crazed by the awful clamorous
racket that his machine was even now
automatically hurling through the ether

  turing to the devil-device they were
fascinated by the whirling whirring vi-
brating activity of the thing at one side
was an electric motor direct-connected
to it by a spinning shaft that disappeared
into its interior this gave life to the
dozens of mechanisms mounted in and on
the vast framework which seemed like
a huge hive alive with myriads of me-
chanical bees around the whole a cir-
cle of microphones received and dis-
tributed the hellish noise

  for a few moments the three who had
come to destroy it gazed in awe at the
marvelous device there were huge
knobbed arms that beat with monoton-
ous regularity on drumheads of all sizes
other arms clanged frantically against
a row of discordant gongs pieces of
polished metal rose and fell and clanked
together great bows seesawed back and
forth across resined strings horns of
every conceivable type hung here and
there and steadily squawked or shrieked
in a hideous chorus flashing bits of
metal or wood rotated or vibrated as each
contributed its part to the revolting holo-
caust of sound they were devoutly
thankful for the drug in their ears that
rendered them deaf to it but now it
must be stopped where was the control
for that spinning motor that ran the aw-
ful thing ah there on the switchboard
was a three-pole switch larger than all
the rest it must control the whole
board and to pull it would stop-

  all three sprang forward at the com-
mon thought williams was first the


weird tales

ethers were dose beside him his hand
stretched out to seize the handle

  clang

  some invisible force jerked upward
the hands that held their weapons the
steel guns were pulled from their fingers
and clashed against the bar fastened to
the huge coils overhead where they stuck
immovable

  disarmed by an electro-magnet

  astounded they half turned and
caught sight of a grotesque figure against
the wall at one side of die door they had
entered his left hand was still on the
switch with which he had sent the cur-
rent through the magnet that had dis-
armed them his right held an auto-
matic pistol that unwaveringly covered
them trapped

  wild eyes mocked them with an in-
sane glare and then from a mouth that
drooled bloody foam came peal after
peal of maniacal laughter though merci-
fully in their deafness they could not
hear it blood showed on the maniacs
flesh through the rents in his muddy
clothes matted hair hung over his glit-
tering eyes and added to his loathsome
appearance not for an instant did those
eyes leave them as he stooped and picked
from the floor a long sharp knife still
dripping red from his participation in
the terrible orgy in the streets he came
slowly toward them the bloodlust in his
eyes and laughing with unholy glee at
the terror he inspired

  lost each gave thought to the dire
word but each was thinking most of the
fact that they had failed and that failure
meant the loss of a world paralyzed
with horror at the thought they waited
while the maniac crept nearer and yet
nearer but with insane cunning he
did not come too close but paused some
fifteen feet away at this the hope that
had begun to mount in williams breast
ebbed entirely away he had been plan-

ning a sudden rush in which he would
have a bare chance should the thang-
possessed madman come close enough
now however all three would fall un-
der his bullets before williams could
take a single step

  hopelessly helplessly they watched
him as a bird watches charmed the sway-
ing evil head of a reptile motioning with
gun and knife he herded them away
from the switchboard to the back of the
room where he lined them up with their
backs to the door to what tortures was
he about to put their helpless bodies
god let him kill them and get it over
with all hope was gone the world was
lost what mattered their lives now

  the professor suffered mental tortures
beyond the others he was thinking of
nan up there in the laboratory with the
living husk of her beloved robert soon
the effect of the drug would wear off and
she would be a victim to the maddening
din of the horror and roberts soul
doomed to eternal torment in the dimen-
sion of the thangs a picture of thdr
separate fates rose before his eyes rob-
erts agonized face floating among the
loathsome heads of the thangs in that
hellish orange atmosphere-forever and
nan his little nan running wild half-
naked and insane screaming through
blood-filled streets no no it must
not be yes-hed try it-god grant
him strength to get to that switch before
the maniacs knife or bullets stopped
him-now now

  the professor sobbing shaking in the
desperation of his wild resolve wheeled
and staggered toward the switchboard
hand outstretched the black form of
the madman darted between him and his
goal and with knife redly gleaming
drew it back to thrust its crimson length
into his body the leering face was
close to his own and the drooling mouth
breathed its fetid breath into his nostrils

wt-
the invading madness



as the red blade began its forward up-
ward sweep and then-

   flash

  something-some invisible force-
tore the crimson knife from the mad-
mans hand and sent it spinning against
the wall where it clattered to the floor
bits of reddened flesh clinging to its hilt
another flash and the gun flew through
the air and fell to the floor beside the
knife the maniac stumbled backward
threw behind him two bloody hands in
a protective gesture and grasped the
bare blades of two shining switches on
the board his teeth exposed by curling
lips clamped shut the red pupils of his
eyes disappeared upward behind black
brows and left the whites dully gleaming
through the strings of his matted hair
his body grew instantly rigid and curl-
ing tentacles of smoke spiraled upward
from his burning flesh stiff black
smoking a charred demon from hell he
hung grotesquely there a crucified sac-
rifice to his own mad genius the tool
of the thangs was dead

  the professor sank fainting to the
floor williams and the doctor had
turned startled and astonished when the
professor had bolted from their side in
his desperate attempt but the action was
so quick events moved so rapidly that
it was several seconds before they raised
their eyes and beheld framed in the door
the stalwart form of robert hargrane
a pistol a thin thread of pale smoke
curling up from its muzzle was in his
hand and behind him peering over his
shoulder were the frightened eyes of
nan answorth

  robert hargrane eyes no longer
staring staring at nothing mind no
longer held in tortured thrall in the
hideous domain of the thangs but here
with his own kind again in time to save
them and save the mind of the world
he strode forward and raised his hand to
wt-

the rubber handle of the shining switch
as he jerked it open they saw his body
sharply outlined against the blue flame
of its arc and beside him the thing that
was the maniac sank smoking to the
floor staring with dead eyes at its whirl-
ing whirring mind-destroying creation
while it slowed and stopped the hor-
ror was ended

back in the professors laboratory the
four men gazed wonderingly at
nan the effects of the drug were di-
minishing and it was good to hear again

  i could not wait nan was sobbing
with joy and while you were gone i
got robert to the machine you had
turned it on father and after i succeed-
ed in getting him on the seat and his
face through the curtain i just stood be-
hind him and prayed and called and
called and he came back to me

the reconstruction was urgent but
must wait the sane of the world
worn out by the physical and mental tor-
ture just now must sleep strength must
be stored up for the stupendous task that
faced them and so seeking places of
protection against the maddened ones
who still roamed the streets they sought
strength and temporary forgetfulness in
restful oblivion

  two persons however were awake
nan and robert sat close together on the
couch in her fathers laboratory tomor-
row they would do their part but now
they had no thought but for each other
while his hand lightly caressed her soft
hair she whispered

  was it as terrible as your poor face
indicated dear there with-with those
terrible thangs

  and as robert turned her lips up to
his he breathed

  not much worse than it would be
here without you sweetheart

                   the courtyard

                   it was the city i had known before

                  the ancient leprous town where mongrel throngs
                  chant to strange gods and beat unhallowed gongs
                  in crypts beneath foul alleys near the shore

                   the rotting fish-eyed houses leered at me
                   from where they leaned drunk and half-animate

                   as edging through the filth i passed the gate
                   to the black courtyard where the man would be

                   the dark walls closed me in and loud i cursed
                   that ever i had come to such a den

                  when suddenly a score of windows burst

                  into wild light and swarmed with dancing men
                  mad soundless revels of the dragging dead-

                   and not a corpse had either hands or head

                      star-winds

                    it is a certain hour of twilight glooms

                  mostly in autumn when the star-wind pours
                  down hilltop streets deserted out-of-doors

                  but showing early lamplight from snug rooms

                    the dead leaves rush in strange fantastic twists

                  and chimney-smoke whirls round with alien grace
                  heeding geometries of outer space

                  while fomalhaut peers in through southward mists

                  this is the hour when moonstruck poets know
                  what fungi sprout in yuggoth and what scents
                  and tints of flowers fill nithons continents

                   such as in no poor earthly garden blow

                   yet for each dream these winds to us convey

                  a dozen more of ours they sweep away

a huge bat clung to the horses
neck sucking its life-blood

	the mysterious coffin

tt wonder whos dead inquired
i dan callahan driver of yanktons
sole taxicab pointing at a long
wooden box with brass handles which
lay on a baggage-truck on the station
platform

  search me replied the station agent
without interest look at the tag if
youre that curious

  but dan quite evidently wasnt that
curious for he slouched into a chair be-
side the one in which the agent sat
against the only cool wall of the freight
house it was late afternoon-or rather
early evening-of an unusually hot june
day there never was very much doing
in yankton pennsylvania and less than
usual this particular afternoon

  the taxi-driver took a crumpled pack-

                                     


weird tales

age from one of his blouse pockets
fished out a crushed cigarette replaced
the package tapped the cigarette on his
chair put the cigarette in his mouth took
off his cap ran his finger around in the
sweatband found a match there replaced
the cap and lit up the station agent was
already smoking a pipe the two sat and
puffed in silence watching the coffin
not that they expected it to do anything
worth watching for but merely that it
happened to be directly in the line of
their vision and hence was as easy to
focus on as anything else

  the shadow of the freight house gradu-
ally lengthened in front of them and
objects in the distance took on a reddish
tinge the definiteness of the shadow be-
came blurred the red tinge faded out and
blue twilight began to fall a faint warm
breeze crept down the tracks bats flut-
tered in and out under the canopy of the
station platform in pursuit of flies and
midges

  a clatter and a roar and a swirl of cin-
ders as an east-bound train swept by
then silence again the oppressive silence
of a warm summer evening heat-light-
ning played over the hills in the distance

  dan callahan the taxi-driver un-
tilted his chair arose slowly and
stretched his arms

  no passengers tonight said he so
i guess ill be going home to maggie and
the kids

  say will you look at that inter-
rupted the railroad man one of them
bats is trying to get into the coffin

  dan looked and made the sign of the
cross clinging to the edge of the box
close to the lock was a small brown bat
fluttering as though with suppressed ex-
citement as the two men stared another
bat joined the first

  they give me the creeps asserted
the agent as rising from his chair and

shuddering he switched on the platform
lights

  hasnt it turned a bit cold asked
dan shuddering too

  the squeak of automobile brakes was
heard and then a third figure rounded
the corner of the freight house the
newcomer was a young man still in his
twenties erect well dressed with straight
pointed nose firm jaw and pleasing
smile

  hello doc dan greeted him eager-
ly hows my little boy

  ive just come from your house re-
plied the doctor youll be glad to know
that the little fellow is much better
responding to treatment beautifully i
believe that i may safely say that he is
out of danger

  doctor crane said callahan fervent-
ly youre a wizard and a brick i thought
sure i was going to lose little dan
youve saved his life and if there is any-
thing that i can ever do for you this side
of hell just ask me thats all sir

  its nothing-nothing replied crane
deprecatingly merely my professional
duty and a great pleasure i assure you
such a manly little fellow

  say doc interrupted the station
agent will you look at them birds try-
ing to get into that there coffin

  well well so they are replied dr
crane jovially i wonder whats attraci
ting them

  and here comes the great grand-
daddy of them all added the agent as a
grayish bat of fully two-foot wing-spread
swooped down -out of the gathering dusk
hooked its wings onto the edge of the
box and snapped viciously at the two
little brown bats already there they fled
squeaking but still fluttered around in
the vicinity

  hm remarked the doctor profes-
sionally

  must be one of these there umpire
another dracula



bats ive heard tell about suggested the
station agent

  dr crane strode over to the box and
brushed the huge creature aside with one
hand the bat snapped at him and then
shambled to one end of the top of the
box where it crouched menacingly the
doctor stooped and sniffed at the crack

  hm he ruminated peculiar smell
very but not at all what i expected no
wonder it attracts these little creatures
as public health officer i must get it to
the undertakers at once who does it
belong to

  dunno doc replied the agent
look at the tag

  by the light of the platform-lamps
crane read aloud  mr peter larousse
yankton pa who is he i wonder
theres no one of that name lives here
i am he said a quiet voice behind
them

nqne of them had heard any-one ap-
proach they turned and saw
that a fourth man had silently joined
them he was tall well over six feet
in height dressed entirely in black
with a short black inverness cape across
his shoulders fastened at the neck by a
single clasp of gold with jet stones in
his right hand he held a black stiff hat
rather narrowed at the top of the crown

  he was old of an indefinable age yet
erect and exuding power and vigor clean-
shaved he was except for a drooping
white mustache his face was aquiline
with high-bridged thin nose and pecu-
liarly arched nostrils he had a lofty
domed forehead crowned with white
hair profuse except around the temples
where it was scanty his eyebrows were
iron-gray and massive almost meeting
over the nose and composed of profuse
bushy hairs the mouth so far as it
showed under the heavy mustache was
fixed and rather cruel-looking with pe-

culiarly sharp white teeth these pro-
truded over the lips whose remarkable
ruddiness showed astonishing vitality for
a man of his evident years his ears
were pale and at the tops extremely
pointed the chin was broad and strong
and the cheeks firm though thin the
general effect was one of extraordinary
pallor

  his hands at first glance seemed
white and fine but closer scrutiny dis-
closed them to be rather coarse-broad
with squat fingers in fact most of the
features of his anatomy although appear-
ing delicate and refined at first never-
theless suffered by prolonged examina-
tion

  his general appearance however was
courtly aristocratic and foreign in the
extreme

  but the most noticeable single item
about him was his eyes small gimlet-
boring and bloodshot without being in
the least bleary the three men who had
preceded him on the station platform
laid the redness of his eyes to the setting
sun but the sun had long since set and
the platform was now illumined by its
electric lights

   am peter larousse he repeated
ignoring the rudeness of their stares
did i hear some one mention my
name

  pardon us sir replied the doctor
you startled us i am doctor crane the
village health officer

  crane advanced extending his right
hand but the stranger did not grasp it
instead he swung his hat across his
breast and made a courtly bow

  you will excuse me i am sure said
he for not shaking hands as i have
an unexplainable aversion to personal
contacts well you called for monsieur
larousse and here i am what do you
wish of me


weird tales

  is that your coffin asked the doctor
abruptly becoming a bit nettled

  the stranger frowned then smiled
quizzically

  yes and no he answered if you
mean am i inside it the answer is no
but if you mean is it consigned to me
the answer is yes i am not dead-
yet

  he bowed again

  well it will have to get to the un-
dertakers at once asserted crane its
a menace to the health of the commu-
nity

  in what way may i ask inquired
monsieur larousse serenely

  it is already attracting vermin re-
plied the doaor

  the large gray bat was no longer to
be seen but the two little brown bats
had returned and were clawing at the lid

  ah the darlings exclaimed the
stranger gloatingly

  striding over to the coffin he shifted
his pointed hat to his left hand and
scratched first one of the little creatures
and then the other on the head

  see he said turning they like me
they know a friend i love all animals
and all animals love me i have a way
with them but now to get down to
business you wish this coffin removed
doaor so do  what is the next
step

  this is mr daniel callahan of the
commonwealth garage introduced the
doaor he can get his motor-trudc at
once the undertaker being an under-
taker can be found at any hour this
other gentleman is mr bill jones the
station agent who can release the ship-
ment and i am the health officer as i
have already stated

  ah what a fortuitous conjunaion of
personages murmured monsieur la-
rousse the arrangements sound excel-
lent

  while dan departed for his truck
and the agent unlocked the freight house
and turned on the lights inside dr
crane asked and what are your plans
for the body-that is i assume the cof-
fin contains a body

  ignoring the implied question the
stranger answered it is of course to be
buried-in your local cemetery to be ex-
plicit what formalities are necessary
you will have to have a cemetery
lot

  i have such a lot

  and a permit from the village derk
i should like to see him at once
then

  he will be in his office tomorrow
morning

  he shall have to see me this eve-
ning asserted the foreigner imperious-
ly i suffer from a disease known as
dermatitis exfoliativa tropica you as
a physician will realize that that means
i must avoid the daylight as much as
possible can not the clerk for a fee
be induced to transaa official business
in the evening

  i am sure he can agreed the doaor
smiling when i tell him about your
disease would you mind my offering
you my professional services the exaa
sort of dermatitis which you mention is
a rare disease at least among white peo-
ple and i have never had the privilege
of treating or even observing a case
then i refuse to be experimented
upon replied the stranger drawing him-
self up haughtily

  just then dan callahan returned with
his truck and the four men put the box
aboard the box was unusually heavy
which rendered all the more noticeable
the effortless ease with which the stran-
ger handled his quarter of the load

gosh exclaimed the agent wiping
his forehead it must weigh a ton
ah my friends explained the
another dracula



stranger there is a lead lining inside
then how the devil did the smell get
out blurted dan

  the stranger glared at him and said
nothing

  will you ride with me invited dr
crane

  thank you no replied larousse
with a slight inclination of his head
the night is beautiful i will walk-
oh just a moment one more question
need the coffin be opened by any one
not if you have the death certificate
with you

   i have the certificate

   so the truck and the doctors car drove
away up the street toward the center of
the village the station agent re-entered
his office to put out the lights and a
large gray bat hovered around the coffin
in the departing express-truck

the center of the village a typical
one-street pennsylvania valley-town
was a bustle of early summer evening
activity stores alight for the evening
trade music issuing from the open
doors of the movie-house couples
strolling back and forth groups chat-
ting at the street corners

  the gray bat did not follow the coffin
into the bright lights of yanktons gay
white way

  dr crane and dan callahan found
the undertakers wife at home and she
sent one of the children out to locate her
husband when he finally arrived the
three men tried to move the coffin and
were having a terrible time at the task
when a calm voice near them said per-
mit me to assist

  it was the tall stranger again with
his help they moved the box with sur-
prizing ease

  next dr crane and monsieur la-
rousse hunted up the village clerk got

him down to his office and secured the
necessary burial permit

  when this formality was over
where are you staying the doctor
asked

  the stranger drew himself up

  that my dear sir said he frigidly
concerns no one but myself

  the young doctor hastened to apolo-
gize

  i only thought we might need to lo-
cate you sir if there should be any hitch
in the proceedings said he

  there will be no hitch as you call
it replied larousse frigidly i have
made all the necessary arrangements
with the undertaker and he assures me
that there can be no unexpected compli-
cations i shall remain in this beautiful
little town for a considerable while you
will find me every evening somewhere
along this street

  and bowing ceremoniously he stalked
off

  after all that ive done for him
said crane to himself he might have
been a little more polite a queer
queer man my what a spooky eve-
ning

  the big gray bat swooped by in spite
of the bright lights startling the doctor
out of his revery

	introducing mr fulton

abit later in the evening the tall
stranger entered mortons general
store and made a few purchases the
news of the arrival of this mysterious
foreigner had spread up and down the
street and now a crowd gathered to get
a good look at him

  in paying for his purchases he lin-
gered quite a while at the cashiers desk
who wouldnt linger for a chat with
mary morton she was by far the most
radiant creature and wholly desirable bit


weird tales

of femininity that the little village of
yankton had ever produced

  a brief description of the town will
not be amiss yankton pennsylvania
boasts one thousand odd inhabitants
they are quite odd and yankton does
not boast them very loudly

  it is a typical old-time new england
village this may seem to be a strange
statement to make about a pennsylvania
community but new england itself is
now overrun by practically every nation-
ality of europe the people of old eng-
lish stock there have lost their control of
everything except some of the financial
centers of state street and the social cen-
ters of back bay in fact they have
been forced to recognize the irish most
of whom came over in the s to build
the railroads as allies of theirs against
the later comers whom they regard as
non-american

  but years ago in revolutionary times
the mountains of pennsylvania and ohio
were settled by new englanders of the
original stock here you will find the
purest forms of new england colonial
architecture here the yankee blood has
remained practically uncontaminated
right down to the present day

  but they had inbred and degenerated
for all of that individuals of marked
mentality had moved away the result
was that the inhabitants of yankton al-
though superficially prosperous well-
dressed and modern were mentally and
morally in the same class with the super-
stitious illiterate mountaineers of other
states and other parts of pennsylvania
itself all that kept them from hex-
murders and witchcraft-trials was a
wholesome fear of ridicule for they were
just educated enough to know that such
things are frowned upon in more cosmo-
politan communities in fact it should
be remembered that the new england
forebears of these yankton folk had had

their own period of hysteria over witch-
craft

  mary morton represented the flower of
the pure old english stock she had re-
verted to type after generations of de-
cline she was the aspiration of all the
young men of yankton and so she had
been able to pick for herself the catch of
the town herman fulton

  herman had had his eye on the main
chance all his life at an early age he
had gone to work in the yankton bank
scorning a college career or even the
completion of high school there were
no college men in yankton except the
two doctors not that yankton men did
not ever go to college but merely that
those who went to college never returned
to yankton they went ojjto wider fields
where they made their long-slumbering
heredity tell yankton could name with
pride many of these distinguished sons
of hers men of national repute who had
turned their backs on their boyhood
home

  but herman fulton had been differ-
ent he had stuck to the bank had spent
next to nothing and had invested and
reinvested his earnings to advantage at
the age of thirty-five still a bachelor he
had worked up to the position of assist-
ant cashier not that this indicated that
herman was possessed of any particular 
degree of intelligence in fact it is
probable that he was subnormal mental-
ly even morons are often fiendishly
clever along some one line and herman
possessed a well-developed money sense
if no other true he was self-educated
and was an avid reader of books on all
subjects but it is to be doubted if he
really understood very much of what he
read although he passed for quite a
learned man in yankton

  when the cashier had conveniently
died soon after hermans attaining the
position of assistant herman had de-
another dracula



manded his place-and had been re-
fused at the next annual meeting he
had calmly ousted the surprized board of
directors who did not realize that certain
controlling blocks of stock standing
nominally in the names of old dr por-
ter and others were really hermans
had substituted a board of his own hench-
men and had elected himself not cashier
but president

  after that whenever herman fulton
requested anything in yankton the
request was usually granted even if the
granter couldnt quite figure out just
what herman intended to do if the re-
quest were refused herman was con-
scienceless and ruthless thus he speed-
ily became the financial power of yank-
ton

  so all the girls who for years had
been setting their caps for him had been
intensely jealous when mary mortons
parents had announced her engagement
to herman

  and then dr ralph crane fresh
from harvard medical college had come
to town just about a year before this
story begins he had picked out yank-
ton as a likely place to build up a coun-
try practise and had been welcomed by
old dr porter who had more patients
than he could handle at his advanced age

  unfortunately young crane had fallen
in love with the beautiful mary and it
was evident that she liked him very
much in fact if he had arrived on the
scene before her engagement to herman
fulton there can be little doubt that the
dashing young doaor would have speed-
ily won her heart but in primitive
communities such as yankton engage-
ments are regarded as being almost as
sacred as marriages in faa they are
usually lived up to a lot better engaged
girls dont even dance with or receive
calls from young men other than their
fiances so ralph crane had had to

content himself with worshipping from
a distance and with such professional
contacts as occasional illnesses in marys
family gave him mary herself was al-
ways the piaure of health

  entering the morton emporium on the
evening in question dr crane observed
with displeasure the quite evident regard
which the courtly european was display-
ing for mary and the flattered interest
which she returned he would speak to
herman fulton about it

  but on second thought he decided
not to speak to herman after all if this
old beau could make adent in hermans
hold on mary so much the better it
was something that he crane would
have liked to do himself if he had not
been deterred both by respect for the lo-
cal conventions and by fear of hermans
power

  at that however there was something
about the performance which jarred on
the young doaors sensibilities in spite
of all his pleasurable anticipations of his
rivals discomfiture it may have been
the may and december aspea of the sit-
uation or it may have been something
else some mere instinaive feeling per-
haps the uncanny events which had ac-
companied monsieur larousses arrival
contributed to dr cranes uneasiness

  had monsieur larousse really ar-
rived this seems a strange question
in view of the faa that here he was and
yet in the course of the evening gossip
developed the faa that he had not been
seen to alight from any of the trains
which had stopped at yankton that day
nor had he got off the lancaster bus
nor had he come in his own auto yet
here he was so he must have arrived-
somehow

  the tall old gentleman lingered in the
morton store until closing time mostly
he wandered up and down the aisles
occasionally he would make small pur-


weird tales

chases whenever opportunity offered
he would chat with mary his attitude
toward her was courtly and unexception-
able

  mortons had many customers that
evening but monsieur larousse did not
seem to notice that he was the center of
attraction the cause of unwonted crowds
in the usually sparsely patronized store

  when pop morton finally put up the
shutters no one happened to notice
where the stranger went he did not
register at the republican house nor did
he put in an appearance all the next day

  around noon dr crane ran across
dan callahan on the street dan was
in his cab the doctor on foot

  hop in shouted dan drawing up
by the curb and ill take you wherever
youre going-free ive something to
tell you

  not that junior is worse i hope
said the young doctor as he got in

  heavens no replied the taxi-driver
junior couldnt get worse with you tend-
ing him doc no its about the old
bird whose coffin we moved yesterday

  not ill is he asked crane profes-
sionally interested and a bit hopefully

  not as i know of replied dan for
he aint been seen since the stores closed
last night no its about his coffin
they buried it this morning without any
service and in the wilson lot

  well

  you know old aunt hattie the
witch who lives in that little cottage just
beyond the cemetery lives all alone
except for one big black tom-cat

  yes

  well shes a wilson and its her
who owns the wilson lot

  hm ruminated the young doctor
bats and coffins and black cats and
witches and burial without church rites
it does sound a bit spooky doesnt it

  it sure does doc agreed dan sol-
emnly

  but neither of them could advance any
theory as to where larousse spent his
nights

	eavesdropping

that evening as soon as the sun had
set and the bats were out out came
the elderly stranger as well for some
time he walked the streets furnishing
the subject of conversation for whisper-
ing groups then as before he entered
mortons store and resumed his atten-
tions to mary

  his attitude was courteous and respect-
ful not a word not an action nor
even a glance that any one could take
exception to he evidently had traveled
extensively and he talked interestingly
of all the countries of the world

  to mary morton cooped up all her
life in this little one-horse pennsylvania
mountain town and-since her engage-
ment to herman fulton-deprived of all
other male attention this elderly stranger
was a diversion in fact almost a god-
send

  herman usually spent his evenings in
his office in the bank but tonight due to
several anonymous phone-calls in several
female voices he abruptly left the bank
dragged his fiancee out from under the
very nose of the elderly stranger and
huffily took her to the movies thus de-
priving her father of his cashier for the
rest of the evening

  peter larousse promptly faded from
the scene his chauffeur had arrived in
town with an expensive foreign car and
this evening drove him out into the coun-
try the chauffeur had registered at the
republican house and the car was kept
in the hotel garage but larousse him-
self did not put up at the republican
house his own lodging-place still re-
mained a secret
another dracula



  the next morning as dr crane
dropped into the morton store to make
some sort of a purchase-a collar per-
haps-he overheard heated words com-
ing from pop mortons private office in
the rear the young doctor wasnt a
gossip or an eavesdropper and accord-
ingly would have scorned to listen in had
he not overheard the mention of mary
mortons name his secret infatuation
for the beautiful girl now proved too
much for him and so he at once devel-
oped an unexplainable interest in some
kitchen cutlery displayed on a counter
along the opaque-glass partition which
shielded the proprietors sanctum

  am i or am i not engaged to your
daughter came from the other side of
the wall in the unmistakable tones of
herman fulton

  of course you are-of course you
are replied pop morton soothingly

  well then continued the young
banker havent i a right to object to my
fiancee compromising herself with that
fish-eyed old french liard

  but she aint compromising herself
objected pop that fish-eyed old
french lizard as you call him has been
perfectly polite and respectful to her
besides he buys lots of things at my
store and lots of people come in here
every evening to take a look at him he
draws more crowds here than any adver-
tising display ive put on in years and
if mary draws him what harms done
at least as long as he behaves himself
its got to stop i demand it

  but why why stop me making
money is that a sensible way to treat
your future pa-in-law

the future wife of herman fulton
has got to be discreet if she cant be
discreet ill break off the engagement
now herman remonstrated mor-
ton id hate to think you cared as little

for mary as all that you wouldnt do
anything like that im sure

  well perhaps not admitted the
banker rather sheepishly then taking
a new tack but do i or do i not hold
a mortgage on your store

  sh sh for heavens sake her-
man dont be so loud about it i dont
want that mortgage broadcast all over the
county

  why not its on record with the
prothonotary up at the county seat isnt
it

  the storekeeper ignored this question
and countered with see here herman
you leave this mooseer larousse alone
for avfew weeks and ill be making

enough off of him to pay up your d-d

old mortgage

  now pop is that a nice way to speak
of your mortgage when i was so kind as
to help you out and lend you all that
money when you had to have it or go
under and it isnt a question of paying
off the mortgage in a few weeks its a
question of paying off that mortgage
right notv its already overdue and i
demand payment my engagement to
your daughter stands but its the mort-
gage against monsieur larousse mary
must stop acting as your cashier until
that spooky old devil stops hanging
around your store

  why do you call him a spooky old
devil asked pop morton artlessly seek-
ing to divert fulton from his line of at-
tack

   because he is one replied the latter
momentarily diverted he comes here
with a coffin and all kinds of strange
bats and things nobody knows who he
is or how he got here or where he came
from he never shows up except at
night he keeps under cover in the day-
time and nobody knows where or why
dr crane listening outside chuckled
softly to himself i know why even if


weird tales

i dont know where its that confound-
ed skin disease he told me about
meanwhile herman fulton was con-
tinuing on the other side of the thin
partition and he buried his coffin in
the wilson lot which belongs to that old
black-cat witch aunt hattie he looks
spooky too he looks like-why do
you know what he looks like its only
just occurred to me ive been reading
a book i got out of the public library
called dracula by a man named bram
stoker all about a he-vampire who
was dead and buried and yet came out
of his coffin every night and sucked peo-
ples blood until they died and became
vampires too this dracula could turn
himself into a bat or a wolf or a shower
of moonbeams in order to get at his vic-
tims ill bet this old bird is count drac-
ula himself or at least another vampire
of exactly the same sort he looks just
like the way dracula was described in
that story

  ha ha ha exclaimed pop morton
with forced levity well thats a good
one ha ha ha a fo-vampire eh
why i thought vampires were only shes
thats the way they always are in the
movies and they dont bite folks
neither ha ha ha a ae-vampire
well thats a good one

  dont laugh pop im serious about
this i really am this is quite a dif-
ferent kind of vampire it would make
your blood run cold to read that story
that man larousse is a positive menace
to this community

  now herman remonstrated mor-
ton in surprize you dont mean to tell
me that you take any stock in such a
cock-and-bull yarn as that

  yes i do pop that story is sup-
posed to be based on mediaeval european
traditions these blood-sucking vam-
pires were well known in the old days
ive looked up about them in the ency-

clopedia too seriously i believe the
mans a menace he ought to be run
out of town

  and then pop morton committed the
tactical mistake of saying but whats to
prevent my making a little money off
him first thereby bringing the conver-
sation back to the argument from which
he had just succeeded in distracting her-
mans attention

  he bit his lip but it was too late to
recall the words

  whats to prevent snorted the
banker im to prevent you take
mary right out of your store and keep

her out or-

  but itll cost too much to hire an-
other girl to do her work interposed
pop wofully entirely apart from the
money i lose by losing this he-vampires
trade you want me to lay out extra
money hiring a substitute for my own
daughter who dont cost me nothing
do you talk of money at a time like
this with your own daughters health
happiness life and even soul at stake
pop im ashamed of you but ill tell
you what ill do ill pay the wages of the
substitute and not put it on the mort-
gage either actually pay it out of my
own pocket and then we neednt tell
mary any of the reasons for what were
doing no need to hurt her feelings by
letting on to her what its all about we
can tell her that im doing it as a special
present to her and because i object to
the future mrs fulton occupying a
menial position even in her own fathers
store my wife must be free of all de-
grading toil

  but think of all the trade ill be los-
ing morton objected feebly

  trade be d-d snapped herman

think of you daughter-and your mort-
gage he added

  the two men emerged and dr crane
hurried away from the cutlery counter
another dracula



   as he left he heard pop morton whis-
per do you suppose he heard us
dont care if he did replied her-
man fulton but not in a whisper hes
only a sawbones

   that night there was a new young lady
at the cashiers window of the morton
emporium but when pop put up the
shutters and went home at nine oclock
he found peter larousse seated on the
front piazza in earnest conversation with
the beautiful mary

	werewolves and such

so it became evident that merely re-
lieving mary morton of her job as
cashier of her fathers store had not been
enough to put a stop to the objectionable
attentions of the weird old foreigner
who herman fulton insisted from the
depths of his reading must be the orig-
inal vampire count dracula or at least
his double

   deprived of the opportunity of chat-
ting with mary at the cashiers wicket
monsieur larousse called on her at her
home

   her father felt that of course he
ought to report the matter at once to her
fiance but he kept putting this off due
partly to a general irresolution of charac-
ter partly to fear of facing herman ful-
ton and partly-it must be confessed-
to a sort of satisfaction that he felt in the
coming-to-naught of all the trouble that
herman had caused him

   as a result it was several days before
herman discovered how the land lay
mary could not be blamed for no one
had ever warned her against the old
frenchman so for several evenings in
succession peter larousse called on her
and was welcomed as she had been
accustomed to spending her evenings at
the store time now hung heavy on her
hands her fiance was busy down at the

bank making money and so she wel-
comed the visits of the distinguished for-
eigner

  although his personality was rather
chilling and revolting yet he did bring
to her the fresh outlook of the outside
world he talked entertainingly of the
far countries which he had visited all
peoples and all times seemed familiar to
him and mary rapidly began to realize
what a limited narrowing and cooped-up
sort of a place yankton was after all

  but one night herman called to take
her to the movies and found peter la-
rousse already there 

  herman was chilled with horror at
first and then he boiled internally at
the thought that all the good money he
had spent in hiring marys substitute
down at the store had been utterly wast-
ed for it had given old dracula an
opportunity to see her even more inti-
mately at home herman would have
liked to make a scene then and there in
fact he nearly did but his long bank-
ing career had schooled him to the real-
ization that making oneself ridiculous
has a bad effect on business and busi-
ness was always uppermost in herman
fultons considerations so although
with difficulty he steeled himself to be
courteous to the older man and politely
begged him to excuse mary for a prear-
ranged date

   the stranger with equal courtesy sub-
mitted but his eyes sized up the young
banker appraisingly

  the deferred scene took place in the
morton parlor later that evening on the
return from the show herman stormed
and mary wept and had to be comforted
but finally because she really did care
for her fiance in spite of his peculiarities
and his domineering manner she agreed
that she would always be out there-
after whenever larousse called

  larousse called regularly every night


weird tales

for a week and at last gave it up like
the drunken man who was thrown out
of a party three times in succession he
knew when he wasnt wanted

  from then on he walked the streets
rather aimlessly after nightfall some-
times he would drop into a picture show
or would sit in the lobby of the repub-
lican house or eveil would make assorted
purchases at the morton emporium but
by now he had become a familiar figure
to the people of yankton and he no long-
er excited their attention to no one
except herman fulton old dr porter
and young dr crane was he any longer
of any moment the interest of the two
doctors was purely professional although
he would not let either of them treat his
strange ailment herman kept his weird
theories to himself for fear of ridicule
but he read everything that he could find
on the subject of vampires even sending
to philadelphia for books when he had
exhausted the bibliography of the yank-
ton carnegie library

  and anyhow so far as known la-
rousse hadnt yet bitten any one in yank-
ton but he was never seen to eat any
regular food

even if the mystery of the mysterious
stranger hadnt grown stale there
now were other matters to distract the
attention of the citizens of yankton it
was an unusually dry summer and the
drought afforded an absorbing topic of
conversation

  in addition to the loss of crops and the
threat against the towns water-supply
there began to be a large and unexplain-
able loss of chickens traps were set
every evening and were found sprung
every morning and still the toll of fowls
continued several people reported hav-
ing seen a lone wolf in the mountains
back of the town

  peter larousse dropped gradually out

of sight he seldom appeared downtown
in the evening any more but no one took
particular note of this defection so in-
tent had they all become on the lone wolf
and the depredation of the chickens
which two phenomena were now quite
generally linked together in peoples
minds

  more people saw the wolf several
poultry-raisers sat up in ambush and got
shots at him but he seemed to bear a
charmed life and to be immune to their
bullets

  eventually a huge german police-dog
was found dead in the hills and from
that time on the wolf was not seen again
and no more chickens were stolen but
no one could persuade the people of
yankton that these events had anything
to do with each other they knew per-
fectly well these pennsylvania mountain-
eers that the wolf had merely transferred
his predatory operations elsewhere
couldnt they tell a wolf from a dog

  as for herman fulton he had his own
theories on the subject but he kept them
to himself

  about the time of the end of the wolf
episode mary morton was taken ill and
called in dr crane the young doctor
didnt mind this at all until the case be-
gan to get serious then he became
frankly puzzled with the situation

  in spite of a good appetite and the con-
sumption of plenty of food mary began
to lose weight and grew pale and wan
tonics were administered but they
seemed to be only temporarily stimulat-
ing finally blood-transfusions were re-
sorted to and these soon had to become
more and more frequent it was evident
that mary was losing blood steadily and
rapidly and yet there was no apparent
cause for this loss

  peter larousse reappeared in his old
haunts his health seemed to have been
another dracula



greatly improved by the bracing air of
the pennsylvania mountains

	dr cranes adventure

finally the young doaor prescribed
a change of scene for his patient
he recommended that she be sent to the
seashore and that specialists be called in
but her fiance although most solicitous
had a narrow provincial clinging to his
native town

  there is no spot in the world more
healthful than the pennsylvania moun-
tains he insisted now that the wolf-
scare is all over lets put her in my cabin
in the hills back of the town ill have
the place all tidied up and will hire mr
and mrs foss to take care of it pay for
the whole performance myself too mrs
foss used to be a trained nurse before she
married josh foss so well be killing two
birds with one stone

  dr crane reluaantly had to acquiesce
herman fulton was not only boss of the
town he was boss of mary morton too

  mary seemed to improve slightly under
the change and ralph crane soon found
that the remote location of the camp gave
him an opportunity to spend an undue
amount of time with his patient without
attraaing attention or exciting any gossip

  then mary began to fail again she
became paler and paler and more and
more bloodless

   her fiance in accordance with his the-
ories made her a present of a beautiful
chased gold crucifix inlaid with what
he said were diamonds which he
begged her to wear all the time in mem-
ory of him he hung the cabin with
bunches of garlic but as mary happened
peculiarly to be rather partial to their
acrid odor she did not mind especially
as she thought that he knew of this
strange liking of hers and was doing it
on that account

  he puttied up all the window-cracks
with what appeared to be bread-crumbs
and did not mention the faa that he had
procured this material at the catholic
church down the valley mary and he
were good methodists

   dr crane ascribed this puttying to the
old new england superstition as to the
baneful effea of night air he remon-
strated roundly on general sanitary con-
siderations but finally gave in when the
nights turned suddenly colder with ap-
proaching autumn especially as the cabin
leaked air like a sieve anyhow

  ralph crane spent long hours nearly
every evening with mary except on the
occasions when herman fulton was there
as a result ralph and mary became very
good friends for the most part they
talked of their pasts than which there is
no better way of getting well acquainted
the girl recounted all the personal de-
tails of her rather uneventful yankton
girlhood the young doaor told of his
city childhood his boyhood on a new
hampshire farm and his struggles to put
himself through phillips exeter acad-
emy dartmouth college and harvard
medical school

  herman fulton didnt seem to mind
this intimacy in faa a sick weak blood-
less and somewhat petulant mary rather
bored him in spite of his regard and con-
cern for her and so he was glad to have
some one else-provided no scandal was
involved-take off his hands the task
of keeping her amused

  one evening when the doaor and the
girl were sitting alone together in front
of the cabin the full moon and a soft
whispering mountain breeze were most
suggestive of the appropriateness of
ghost stories so crane embarked on-an
apt tale of his new hampshire boyhood

  the farm on which i worked said
he was about two mfles from the lake


weird tales

from which we got our water supply
there was a hot-air pump down by the
shore of the lake which pumped the
water up to a tank beside the barn that
sort of pump is a very simple affair a
little fire-box holding only a shovel-
ful or two of coal and then a single
air-cylinder and piston about a foot
in diameter on top of that and then on
top of the cylinder a heavy three foot fly-
wheel this was the engine layout i
dont remember how the pump itself was
hitched up-all we had to bother with
was the engine if that went then the
pump went too you dont see many of
that kind of pump nowadays

  i never heard of one the girl said

  dr crane continued it would run
all night on one loading of coal that is
unless it happened to stop when it
stopped you could tell up at the farm-
house because the thump thump thump
in the pipes wouldnt sound any more
then whichever of the farmhands turn
it was would have to light up a lantern
trudge two miles through the woods
down to the lake climb up on the big
flywheel hang on to one side of it to
give it a spin and thus start the pump
pumping again well this particular
summer we were troubled with mountain
lions

  real lions interrupted mary

  not the kind you see in circuses ex-
plained ralph the kind that we had
up in new hampshire looked about like
a lioness only somewhat smaller and
slimmer both sexes look alike the
male hasnt any mane sometimes they
call this creature a mountain lion or a
catamount cougar panther painter
puma or what have you well anyhow
two of them came down out of the north
woods up by mount chocorua and
started stealing chickens much like this
wolf they had around here last month

only these beasts occasionally took sheep
and calves too a boy friend of mine
tolly piper was driving the cows home
from pasture one day when one of these
lions jumped out of the bushes picked
up a calf right under tollys nose and
jumped back into the bushes again with
it

  horrible murmured the girl

  the young doctor warmed to his story
and went on one day one of them
walked right into an afternoon tea of
summer folks it calmly surveyed the
scene while all the people sat frozen to
stone then it slipped quietly back into
the woods again and at night you could
hear them calling to each other from one
range of hills to another a most weird
sound

  did you ever see either of them
asked the girl

  saw both of them was the reply
one night around midnight i was lying
awake in my second-story room in the
farmhouse listening to the howls when
i noticed that the voices of the two lions
came nearer and nearer together until
finally they met in the woods just between
the farm and the lake then the sounds
got louder and louder we had some
tame foxes in a wire-netting cage just
back of the house and i could hear our
poor little pets whimpering with fright
then there came an unusually fierce
scream from one of the lions followed by
a crash against the wires of the cage
then another scream and another crash
as the other beast sprang this was re-
peated several times but after a time the
two animals gave it up and came toward
the house i could see them distinctly in
the moonlight which was as bright as it
is tonight they would walk a few steps
and then sit on their haunches throw
back their heads and howl one time

e houje of tke golden

if tim gallagher had not spent
twenty-four of his twenty-eight years
in america three thousand miles
from the land of his birth he would have
missed the adventure that greeted him
almost as soon as he set foot again in
county cork for the wisdom of his na-
tive land would have warned him that
the odds were against even his six feet
of young strength but american public
school and college and associates had
practically obliterated his atavistic super-
stition and so it was that he spent half
a night following the dancing lure of
light that kept always just out of reach-
careless alike of the fact that it was may
eve and that better men than he had
lost in their pitiful conflict with the will-
o-the-wisp

   w t-

  in fact irish though he was he did
not realize that it was the will-o-the-
wisp that he followed he knew only that
here was something puzzling intriguing
which challenged his imagination and de-
termination and so he went after it
striding on firm ground crashing into
briers sloshing dangerously through a
swamp and always definite yet elusive
barely an arms length away yet as free
of his grasp as the stars the witch-light
dulled his apprehension until suddenly
conscious of a barrier other than rocks or
trees he tore his gaze from that flicker-
ing invitation and found himself con-
fronted with a building

  it was one of those peasant-cabins
familiar to every tourist but in the dark-
ness it seemed to have a significance out

                                      


weird tales

of all proportion to its size-a signif-
icance enhanced by the mere faa of its
existence in so desolate and lonely a
place

  tentatively tim started around it
ready to spring back or forward at the
slightest warning yet unaware of what
he fcatcd and moving in this way he
felt a slight but unmistakable shock on
finding his path barred by a great flow-
ering shrub which seemed to throw a
peculiar unreal glamor over everything

  tim had never before seen red haw-
thorn in bloom he could not really be
said to see it now but in the darkness
he fek it-all its compelling superna-
tural beauty aaing almost like a drug to
his tired body and nerves

  lor a long minute he stood sensing it
struggling to recall the forgotten lore of
his homeland hawthorn - it meant
something-it had some strange associa-
tion deep-rooted in his race   

  he shrugged abandoning the effort
and was about to knock to ask his way
back to the town he had left when a
slight rustle caused him to turn sharply
luckily as he did so his shoulder
touched the cottage door and it gave
the next instant he was inside his-back
against itsrotting panels the sweat pour-
ing over his livid face at the recolleaion
of the two oblique yellow eyes that had
flared out of the darkness hardly a yard
away

  what had he seen what manner of
beast was it that crept out of the night
invisible even in shadowy outline except
for those terrible eyes was it a beast at
all was it anything-except his imagi-
nation

  his mouth twisted in a bad attempt at
a smile imagination where would he
get an imagination to conjure up even an
hallucination as infinitely evil as those
eyes

  there was something there-outside
-waiting for him or was it waiting
would it wait

  wait naturally what else could it
do he was here sheltered safe here
he would stay until dawn for some
reason he felt that the thing whatever
it was would be powerless in broad sun-
light he would wait dien it was ri-
diailous to yield to the prickle at his
spine the weak chattering of his teeth
with an almost heroic effort he con-
trolled them - and as if in deliberate
mockery a cascade of ghastly demoniac
laughter seemed to fall from die rafters
just above his head

  at die same second direaly in front
of him less than ten feet away the dread
golden ellipses flared-and faded

  at that sheer absolute terror owned
him-terror in whidi was no element of
common sense or reason he lurched
forward stubbed his toe and caught up
the small stool in his path instina mak-
ing him grab it automatically as a wea-
pon

  his quick motion had an unexpected
result it fanned into momentary life a
fragment of peat and die glow gave him
a swift knowledge of the huts interior
it was about eight feet square with a cen-
tral hearth and one window the reali-
zation of that window restored his cour-
age through it he had seen those ter-
rible eyes-they were not visible through
a wall nor had their owner entered the
hut in some uncanny way and die
knowledge served to revive his reason

  he was moving slowly now sliding
along the wall if he could reach the
window reconnoiter widiout being seen
or sensed by the thing outside he might
be able to settle the mystery after all
many animals had eyes luminous at night
it might be diat it was only his fatigue
the house of the golden eyes



that gave these such a sinister atmos-
phere

  a faint draft warned him that the win-
dow was less than a foot away and its
freshness made him abruptly aware of
the fetid odor of the cottage from the
moment of his entry he had been vaguely
conscious of it even through the nerve-
racking events of the past few minutes
but now it nauseated him and he closed
his eyes drawing deep breaths of the
night air

  fortunately it refreshed him for rais-
ing his lids he found himself staring
into those golden eyes and knew that
they were steadily approaching gather-
ing himself together his left hand took
quick measurement of the window while
his right raised the stool but he never
threw it for without sound or warning
the space between him and those eyes
melted something slashed his face from
the corner of his brow to his mouth
barely missing his eye and he found him-
self hung half over the sill grappling
with an unknown antagonist which
seemed to fight him as impersonally and
effortlessly as a spirit

  but it was not a spirit twice his hand
closed on thick short fur beneath which
he sensed delicate bones the second
time he wrenched violently at what
seemed to be the creatures foreleg and
only the repeated slash of pain-this time
across his grasping hand - saved the
bones in his grip from being snapped
in the second his grasp relaxed his an-
tagonist jerked back and in that instants
respite he realized the terrible danger of
grappling with this unknown thing par-
ticularly with his own strength and tech-
nique so seriously impaired by the wall
between them undoubtedly the part of
wisdom was to sit back to the door stool
in hand keeping a dark vigil until dawn
and he had almost decided to do this

when the terrible golden eyes were again
directed toward him and he realized that
they must be barely outside the window
or actually within the room there was
only one thing to do raising the stool
he beat straight at them and though the
blow was broken by the wood splintering
against the window-frame he knew that
it had to some extent struck home for a
scream more terrible than any sound he
had ever heard filled the night with awful
vibrations it was neither human nor
animal every tree and stone in the des-
olate place seemed to echo it the house
itself quivered with it

   abruptly he felt that the conflict was
over that he was alone yet he had none
of the exhilaration of the victor he was
dizzy nauseated oppressed by the dark-
ness the lack of air the stench in the
cottage the gash in his face had begun
to throb and putting up his hand he dis-
covered it was deeper than he had re-
alized somewhere there must be water
in the cottage gathering his spent
strength he began a blind hunt for it
twice he bumped into the wall once
into a rickety table except for that and
a bundle that might be rags serving for a
bed the place seemed empty

   at last he discovered a series of rough
board shelves but his quick hope that
there might be a water-jug on them was
vain the lowest was crowded with bot-
tles-small queerly shaped phials for
the most part toward the back two or
three of decanter size cheated him afresh
by proving to be filled with noxious
strange liquids the second shelf held
books and his hand on their covers dis-
turbed thick dust-or the brown musty
powder into which ancient calf bindings
degenerate the third held a few broken
pieces of crockery and what felt like
pewter utensils

  the fourth seemed at first empty on


weird tales

a level just above his head his exploring
hand ran half its length without encoun-
tering anything then quite without
warning he touched the shelfs sole occu-
pant it was warm alive he was aware
of a muted thrum and rustle just above
his head and jumped back at the instant
that die cottage was filled again with
ghastly inhuman laughter

  his heel caught in the bundled rags
he stumbled fell backward lay still
aware of two things the filthy odor
which permeated the place was like a
drug stifling him and there was some-
diing hovering just above him he could
not see it but he knew it was there he
almost fancied he could feel a faint
breath-yet it was too quick too pulsing
for breathing with a great effort he
raised his hand to his face-apparently
nothing was above him yet in that last
instant of consciousness he knew that it
was something living suspended in the
air not a foot away

when he opened his eyes the sun
was streaming into the hut and-
except for the dull pain of his face and
hand - the whole ghastly night might
have been a dream there was nothing
whatever sinister about the little room it
was precisely what he had at first thought
it-a typical peasants home it was not
even as dirty as most of them were then
he remembered and sniffed apprehen-
sively and discovered a faint unmistak-
able trace of the odor that had practically
anesthetized him die night before

  what could it have been he raised
himself half on his elbow and stared
about there was no trace of food or
drink-nothing that could have so filled
the room with disgust his gaze reached
the hearth rediscovered the dead peat
ashes swung above them was a great iron
pot it must be in that the place was

apparently abandoned and its former
owner might have left food in it in that
case the fire lit by some chance wanderer
the night before might very well have
liberated die fetidness

  he was on the point of rousing him-
self and investigating when he heard
someone singing the voice was a
womans peculiarly sweet and with just
that undercurrent of wildness appropri-
ate to her surroundings he lay back
again on the bundle of rags which had
served him for a bed and listened com-
fortably aware that she was approaching
and that many of his problems would be
solved by her presence undoubtedly she
would get him water and food and once
he had had diem and relaxed long
enough to regain some of his lost nervous
energy he could follow her directions
bade to town

  she was near enough now for him to
hear the rustle of the shrubbery which
she brushed in passing another minute
and her song had stopped on a peculiarly
haunting minor note and glancing up
he saw her in die doorway

  he was impressed at first with her
slender straightness it hardly seemed
that her feet touched the ground and the
slight wind stirring her full skirt added
to the atmosphere of lightness about her
in her hand she held a branch of the
hawthorn the sun struck through its
translucent blossoms and turned her
tousled red hair to a living flame giving
her delicate silhouette peculiar life he
watched her for a long minute in sheer
pleasure at die dark lithe outline with
its relief of fragile red flowers and then
realized diat she was not alone on her
shoulder perched a great blade bird

  he said come in wont you

  she did not answer and he felt that
she was smiling widi a sort of amused
contempt but she did as he asked and
the house of the golden eyes



he noticed as she moved that her walk
justified his first impression of her light-
ness she seemed almost to float as she
crossed to him there was only one
blemish to her perfect grace-her left
arm hung limp at her side as if a blow
had paralyzed or injured it

  when she was quite near him she
turned a little and now for the first
time he saw her face

  just why he should have felt that
slight subconscious shock he could not
have said it was undoubtedly the per-
fect face for such a figure - the face
whichjhe should have expected long
with slightly pointed chin it had all the
fragile beauty he could have desired for
it the slightly peaked brows were like
an etching on the white skin and the
amber eyes beneath them were the na-
tural accompaniment for burnished red
hair there was only one thing to mar
the first impression of perfect beauty
the girl had apparently been eating ber-
ries and a tiny red stain at the corner of
 her full lips threw the moudi out of
symmetry

   as she paused beside him the great
bird on her shoulder teetered forward
and seemed to peer into his face with
sinister curiosity he saw her lips move
and though he heard nothing the bird
flapped its wings and with a peculiarly
ungraceful motion rose from her shoul-
der and sagged through the air to the
shelf he realized suddenly that this had
been the diing he had touched in the
dark the thing he had sensed hovering
above him as he sank into his coma

   he said sharply do you live here

   for a second he thought a queer light
moved behind the girls eyes but when
she answered him her voice had all the
sweetness that had filled her singing

  yes how did you come here

	i lost my way

  how long have you been here
  since an hour or so after dark

   he felt that she was about to say some-
thing then but though her eyes returned
to him three or four times and her lips
half parted she did not speak finally
he broke the silence

  i am very thirsty can you get me
some water

  her brows drew together water
yes of course i told you i am
thirsty and i havent washed since sun-
down besides-my face-

  he moved slightly so that his slashed
cheek was suddenly out of the shadow
and toward her and at sight of it she
started back a combination of horror and
sorrow contorting her face a queer
little sound broke from her-something
between a cry and a moan and at die
same instant die terrible laughter which
had twice before frozen him filled the
cottage

  good god-what is-

  nothing she leaned toward him
panting a little only my bird he has

a split palate-it is nothing to fear-

  her voice faded and in spite of her
words of reassurance he was swept by
sudden inexplicable dread there was
something too intent almost fascinated
in her gaze fixed on his wound it
seemed to sear it like a flame

  he raised himself on his elbow and
that threw his face into shadow again
and once her gaze was broken she drew
a long shuddering breath and moved
back swaying as if she had been on the
point of fainting

  water - you said you wanted

water-

  no matter he forced himself to
his feet ill get it-there must be a

spring-

   but in spite of her apparent faintness
she reached the door before him


weird tales

  no you will not leave and as he
started back frowning it would be
foolish for you to go you do not know
where there is a spring besides-there
was something almost cunning in her
eyes-you are tired you have lost much
blood-

  her voice rose weirdly and she turned
and ran from him sending the word
echoing back to him from the trees-
blood    blood   

hedetermined to leave at once in
spite of his exhaustion and was
about to step out of doors when he saw
the girls hawthorn bough across the
threshold and stooped to put it aside it
was too lovely to tread on the next mo-
ment he regretted his softness for the
movement seemed to liberate a swarm of
bees which had apparently been stealing
honey from the flowers there were so
many of them that it would have been
foolhardy to force a way through them
and he drew back into the shelter of the
hut furious at the delay

  at any moment the girl might come
back and he found himself dreading her
return what was it about the cottage
about her that filled him with such ter-
ror america with its healthy matter-of-
factness seemed-of another world here
his atavism owned him claimed him
through immemorial centuries for forgot-
ten beliefs and fears a week before he
would have scorned any hysterical girl
for believing in the fancies which held
him now he kept telling himself that
it was all ridiculous-but the slash across
his cheek proved that ridiculous or not
there was real danger here instinct
warned him that he must get away before
the owner returned and he was about to
chance the bees when he remembered the
pot on the hob

  it would take only a second to inves-

tigate it and he realized that there was
something about it-something which he
must know

  he crossed to the hearth and holding
his breath removed the heavy lid a thin
bluish vapor rose and twisted upward
he peered into the black interior but
could see nothing at the same instant
he heard a footstep and replacing the
cover whirled around

  the girl stood in the doorway an
earthen ewer in her hand apparently
she had no suspicion of his prying and
entered the place as casually as though
there were no need for haste or fear or
distrust and her first words held none of
the suggestion that had undertoned her
last ones

  if youll come into the light ill
bathe it-

  instead of gratitude revulsion filled
him no-ill do it thanks out
there are the bees gone	

  bees he thought he heard a faint
note of mockery behind the monosyllable
but her face was guileless there are
no bees hereabouts

  he was on the point of speaking but
thought better of it and seated himself
on the stone lintel the girl leaned
against the door jamb watching and as
the water cleansed the slash and the
blood began to flow he realized that she
was quivering and felt a sudden over-
whelming nausea

  he had no doubt now that she was
mad and that her insanity was liberated
by blood-the sight even the thought of
it shaking her equilibrium he had heard
many strange tales of maniacs who
seemed normal until some slight mishap
overthrew their delicate mental balance

  go inside he said harshly and when
she did not move he looked up go
on

  she ran her tongue over her lips he
the house of the golden eyes



saw that it was pointed and too red it
touched the comer of her mouth-the
little red stain her eyes glittered

  he trembled with horrid realization
and sprang to his feet

  she fell back before him-and was
suddenly only a normal beautiful girl-
laughing a little

  you are nervous what is the mat-
ter

  he hesitated should he confront her
with his discovery make a bold front and
tell her the truth

  come in she said and there was
only quiet invitation in her tone but he
shuddered

  no im going on now thanks

  going on she shook her head
but you cant the storm-

  he had not noticed a storm before
he could have sworn that there had been
no sign of one a moment before yet now
die sky was black and the heavy menace
of thunder shook die place a drop
splashed at his feet

  you see and there is no regular
road from here it would be foolish-
even dangerous-

   she was still standing just over the sill
but he shook his head

  ill watch it from here im not
afraid of storms

  her eyes were brooding as you
wish

  she turned from him and seemed to
fade into the storm-darkness of the huts
interior he could not see her and this
added to his uneasiness though he heard
her moving about he shifted his posi-
tion so that he could watch the place
where she must be but to know that she
was there and yet discover no trace of
her was worse than not to know her
whereabouts

  as if in answer to his thought a quick
flame rose on the hearth he had heard

no match struck and the effect was that
of created spontaneous light but he was
grateful for it whatever its source by
it he could see much of the room-and
though lie could not discover his host-
ess there was a human shadow unmis-
takably indicating her presence

  suddenly he knew that it was strange
that lie could not see the girl someone
was stirring the pot he could hear the
sound of a spoon going round and tound
in it he could see it sway and swing to
the rhythm

  yet-there was no human thing beside
that hearth

  the brew began to bubble he could
hear it-and hear also a soft persistent
muttering no syllable could he distin-
guish yet suddenly clear as the light-
ning around him flashed the key to that
nights mystery

  he had been lured by some super-
human force to diis place he was held
here by the same force what it was no
man could say-but it ruled more human
beings dian any other intangible thing
he was in die spell of witchcraft the
girl was a witch the bird was no bird
--it was a demon and the laughter shat
had frozen him was demon- aughter
god knew what was in the terrible
pot--

  what would be in it by morning

  in swift dread he flung from the door-
way and as if to mock his futility a
sword of fire descended from the sky
split a great tree crashed it across his
path the shock threw him back against
the hut but he was unconscious of the
pain of the impact he knew only that he
must escape-now-at once

  answering his resolution the mutter-
ing inside became frenzied the great
red hawthorn swayed bent to the earth
was it only the wind that moved it and
tossed its brandies into a bristling bar-


weird tales

rier hawthorn-he remembered now-
it was the witches tree and sacred to the
sidhe no irishman would harm so much
as a leaf of it when the girl had broken
a bough he should have realized that
she was not all human

  inside the cottage was a hush more
dreadful than sound

  he moved very slightly stared in the
girl stood by the table she was lighting
three candles he noticed that they were
black and the forgotten phrase corpse
candle stirred his memory made him
shiver yet by their light she seemed
both human and fragile his courage re-
turned he strode into the place deter-
mined to make an end of what all his
training had taught him was ridiculous

  she turned slowly back to the light
she was again a silhouette in the storm-
darkened room he saw her eyes-golden
ellipses

  it had been she-she herself not
some creature out of hell to do her bid-
ding-but herself that limp arm-it
was limp from the blow of the stool yet
the thing he had grasped had been furry
-it had been an animal-

  out of mediaeval legends out of mod-
em horror-tales whirled the lore of the
werewolf he remembered a dozen such
stories which he had scorned

  the little red stain at the corner of her
mouth the panting avid concentration
on the slash across his face

  she moved slowly toward him but he
felt himself powerless to stir without
taking her eyes from him she reached
forward touched the kettle it began to
swing rhythmically in the shadows over-
head the demon-bird gibbered

  the pot tipped-more more some of
its contents slopped over a drop or two
spattered on the peat the fire flared
greenly in that ghastly light he saw the
widening pool on the floor it seemed to

reach toward him there was something
bloated parboiled to a dull red sliding
toward him-a human hand borne on
the slow slime

  he started back almost without voli-
tion his fingers fled from his brow to his
breast from shoulder to shoulder

  for a moment he thought that light-
ning had struck the hut it quivered as
if it had been touched by a mighty
finger

  the witch seemed turned to stone-
absolutely immobile only her golden
eyes proved that she was still alive

tim turned and fled blindly out of
the hut into the storm how long
he ran he did not know he looked back
only once - and whether the pursuing
golden eyes were real or imaginary he
could not have told but he did not trust
to their being imaginary

  he was half fainting when through
the breaking storm he finally saw the
comfortable outlines of a village as he
stumbled into its street a dozen simple
folk hurried to help him they were
curious over-solicitous-but he kept his
own counsel

  finally they began to offer him in-
formation they told him that his wounds
showed that he had met the fabulous
great wolf of the north no creature
had ever seen it and lived to tell of it
hundreds of sheep had been slaughtered
twice children had disappeared and
recently a man-

  he shuddered in grim recollection

  but he did not reveal what he had
seen it was true that these countrymen
of his might not scoff at the story the
old world is too wise to reject matters
which outstrip ordinary human ken but
tim had spent most of his life in amer-
ica-and it had set the seal of incredulity
on his irish lips

no best or worst girl to be considered
in my case and the plain fact is im sick

  jim worthington stirred sufficiently in
his long chair to regard the flushed face
of his young friend quizzically who
has been introducing you to the semi-
centennial works of robert louis steven-
son dont you know that the hawaiian
islands are now at least as civilized as
iowa youre a quarter of a century too
late to take refuge from civilization in
hawaii better sail farther and fare
worse

  oh i know that honolulu and hilo
and places like that are as civilized as
chicago or atlantic city but there must
be places on the islands where a fellow
can buy a few acres run up a shack and
lead the simple life alone with the si-

tropical fruits and flowers

  well i wish you the best of luck if
you really mean it but just for the sake
of having a sporting interest in your ven-

youll be sicker of silence and scenery
within one year than you are now of civ-

weird tales

now is it agreed that you are to write to
me regularly and keep me informed as
to how near i am getting to winning
or losing that thousand

       

       ell jim old stay-at-home this
vv is my first solemn written warn-
ing from aloha land that you are surely
going to lose that thousand you should
have felt a premonitory pang in the re-
gion of the pocketbook about two weeks
ago when i found my place its only
about a dozen miles from honolulu-
youll hoot at that-but it might be a
hundred for all one sees or knows of the
city from here the great koolau range
runs behind the city and cuts it off from
the windward side of the island of oahu
with a three thousand foot wall of rock
wall is the right word too it rises as
nearly perpendicular as any formation
can be that has been exposed to erosion
for a thousand years or so it-s all solid
lava probably thrust up by some gigantic
volcanic action long ago its sides are
furrowed with gullies and buttressed
with shoulders built up of the eroded ma-
terial and that makes it look climable
-and it is for perhaps one-third of the
way up one might even scramble up
another third by picking a particularly
likely spot but thp final third would defy
a chamois or a swiss mountaineer unless
he cut his own steps in die solid rock
ahead of himself there are dark patch-
es just above the line of possible climb-
ability that look as if they might be the
mouths of caves caused by deeper erosion
in softer strata but no one will ever
know whether they are caves unless he
flies in an airplane close enough to look
down and into them and no level-headed
aviator is likely to try that with a variable
trade wind pouring itself against the base
of the wall and zooming up straight to
the pearly gates

 why so much about my wall-i
call the mighty koolau range my wall
because it is both my barrier against civ-
ilization and the background for all my
silence and scenery my place is about
a mile and a half from the base of the
wall its on a hill about five hundred
feet high in fact it is the hill ive
bought the whole thing with a fence
around it running down to a mountain
stream at the base

  im building my house right on the
crest of the hill with a big veranda-
they call em lanai out here-facing the
wall ive already roughed out a trail
down the hillside through the wild
guavas to the stream where theres a fine
swimming-hole fifty or sixty feet long a
dozen wide and four or five deep the
whole hillside is covered with wild
guava bushes at present but ill have
most of them grubbed out by the time
ive won your thousand and with that
ill buy papaias banana and coconut
palms mangoes and the rest so that in
a couple of years more ill be independ-
ent of civilization entirely except to buy
an occasional shirt or pair of shorts
which is all i wear out here


tve been grubbing guavas all day in
a the hot sun but it must be a month
since last i wrote you a warning that your
thousand is already as good as deposited
to my account with the first national
bank of bishop so ill see if a change of
employment really is as good as a rest
its amazing what a few weeks of steady
work will do with a place like this my
house is finished its mostly studio liv-
ing-room with a little kitchen bedroom
and bath ive cleared off the whole of
the top of my hill and sown it to grass
with a few flowering shrubs to set off the
house and break the fence corners now
im clearing a three-foot trail through
guardians of the guavas



the wild guavas down the face of my hill
toward the wall

  you should see it-the wall i
mean its never twice the same what
with the drifting clouds and shifting
shadows there are always half a dozen
rainbows arched over its buttresses or
woven through the clouds around the
peaks its a tremendous thing to have
right in ones own back yard i stop
grubbing guavas half a hundred times a
day to turn toward it and drink it all in
reminds me of that old psalm i will lift
up mine eyes unto the hills whence
cometh my strength

  something seems to flow down from
those jagged peaks sure enough maybe
its streams of prana-vital energy-and
the menehunes manufacture it in those
caves i told you about in my first letter
menehunes by the way are hawaiian
fairies or perhaps it would be more ac-
curate to call them gnomes all the old
hawaiians believe in them say theyve
been seen many a time describe them
as being a foot or two tall with long
beards all dressed in the old hawaiian
style

  there was a bit in one of the hono-
lulu papers the other day about the chil-
dren at one of the public schools seeing
a real live menehune during the noon re-
cess they all said he was about a foot
high with a long gray beard and that
he went by grumbling to himself and
eating peanuts out of a paper bag that
paper bag sort of spoils the picture
doesnt it sounds too civilized for a
menehune but anyway all the children
-and there was about a dozen of them
of all races-swore that they really saw
him an hour or so after the paper was
out all the old hawaiians were down
there in the school grounds helping the
children to hunt for the menehune

  well im afraid ive befen too thor-

oughly civilized to take much stock in
menehunes but the scenery and the si-
lence are sure going great ill be a new
man in less than a years time but you
can count on my being enough of my old
self to claim that thousand promptly
when its due

     -   
xtou are going to win your thousand
x after all jim and if it were ten
youd win it just the same i am writing
this from a private hospital for mental
cases here in honolulu but im not
mad old man not that and just as soon
as the doaor thinks that my nerves are
calm enough ill be boarding the first
boat for the mainland i suppose i
should wait and tell you all about it then
but ive another week or two to put in
here before theyll let me leave and it
will pass the time and be a sort of a re-
lief to tell you in this way writing a bit
at a time and then resting

  i scarcely know how to begin the
whole thing must sound so incredible to
one who hasnt aaually gone through it
im sure i wouldnt have believed it my-
self a month ago and when i tried to ex-
plain to the doaor here how my nerves
got in such a condition he merely gave
me a soothing murmur and something to
put me to sleep but its true i tell you
old man every word of it well id
better just go back to the beginning and
let the tale tell itself

  it began one night about three weeks
ago when i was sitting on my lanai fac-
ing the huge dark bulk of the wall a
mile and a half away and smoking my
pipe peacefully i would sit there al-
most every night admiring the moonlit
view of range and valley but that night
there was no moon only a powdering of
star-dust across the sky making the scene
faintly visible -the old wall loomed
up black as a thunder cloud and as i


weird tales

kept my eyes turned toward it idly i
fancied i saw blue-green lights glowing
here and there about a third of the way
from the crest i thought of those caves
i told you about and wondered whether
anyone could possibly be living in them
then i recalled how utterly inaccessible
they appeared in full daylight and dis-
missed the notion from my mind the
blue-green lights persisted however and
the longer i watched them the more
clearly they seemed to demark the en-
trances to the caves as i had mentally
placed diem from many observations
the idea came to me as i puffed my pipe
that maybe they really were inhabited by
menehunes making their old magic over
there where man couldnt get near them
then i began to wonder again whether
a man couldnt manage to scramble up
the wooded scarp to one of the larger
openings which i had particularly noted
because it was the only one that seemed
to present climbable possibilities just
then the full moon came out flooding
valley and wall with light no less power-
ful than that during a half-eclipse of the
sun and curiously like that in quality
so came my crazy notion to hike over to
the wall in the moonlight and tackle the
climb to the cave

   the blue-green light had been blotted
out by the moon but it was there a min-
ute before and that seemed to say that
whoever or whatever inhabited the cave
would surely be at home like a fool
i didnt even stop to get my flashlight
though i should have remembered that
there are always heavy clouds oyer and
around die koolau range and i might
have anticipated that the moonlight
would fail me before i could complete
that three-mile hike with the climb in
the middle of it

  the moon shone steadily while i
crossed the wide valley following the

cow trails through the wild guava and
coming to the open grass land sloping
up to the wall where the going was
even easier it couldnt have taken me
much more dian half an hour from the
time the notion seized me till i was be-
ginning my scramble up the steep face
of the scarp i was soon sorry that i
hadnt changed to breeches and boots in-
stead of starting out in the shirt and
shorts id been wearing all day to work
on my trail those lava needles and guava
roots were surely hard on die naked
calves and thighs i cut myself pretty
badly once or twice and must have lost
quite a lot of blood without realizing it
however i wasnt going to be turned
back by a little thing like that so up i
went pulling myself up two-thirds of my
own height here and there by holds on
guava roots and having to work a way
around many a place where die rock face
was sheer perpendicular with no holds
for hands or feet

  it was much more of a climb than i
had anticipated but i couldnt quit when
i must be only a few hundred feet at
most from my goal i looked back for a
moment with one foot on a lava needle
and one hand on a guava root and i
was amazed to see how high i had come
the wall and the steep slopes fell away
into the moonlit valley beneath me with
what looked like an unbroken drop of
a third of a mile over across the val-
ley and far beneath the spot where i
clung i could see the lights of my own
home on the little hill i was feeling
fairly well done in what with the hard
days work and the steep climb to which
my muscles were not yet accustomed and
then the loss of blood may have weak-
ened me somewhat how i wished i
were back in my comfortable chair under
those lights on the lanai i wished it
more than ever a moment later really
guardians of the guavas



wished it as a drowning man must wish
for air for just then the moon went out
it went out just as if a giant hand had
readied up and turned off die switch but
when i strained my eyes up into the dark
i could see a very faint luminosity still
there behind a bank of black cloud which
seemed to reach from the wall to the sea
i remembered that cloud too late al-
most every night i had seen it drift in
from the ocean till it blanketed the val-
ley from midnight till dawn it must
have been just about midnight at that
moment and there was i in almost black
darkness hanging to a guava root above
a drop of a third of a mile

  i think my nerve began to crack at
that moment but the one diing that i
couldnt possibly do was to stay where i
was until morning already i felt my
damp hand slipping on the smooth guava
root i must move up or down and i
already knew only too well the impossible
danger in the darkness of the way over
which i had come in die bright moon-
light its always easier to climb up than
down anyway feeling for ones holds
with the naked hand rather than with the
shod foot

  i dont know how long i climbed
through the terrible blackness or how
far it seemed an age and a mile or
more but it was probably less than an
hour and i doubt whether i had gained
much more than fifty feet on the perpen-
dicular under the almost impossible con-
ditions of the climb i was beginning to
crack with fatigue too each upward
inch seemed to call for the last possible
ounce of vital energy and still there was
always another ounce for the next inch
it couldnt last though and i caught my-
self deliberately contemplating the possi-
bility of letting go and dropping away
from all this unendurable labor into the
peace of the valley

  i couldnt do it we may diink such
thoughts but our bodies wont let us sur-
render to them while there is a spark of
vitality left the end came soon enough
anyway i had tested the guava root
with almost the whole weight of my
body while my left foot rested firmly
enough  another but as i swung free
on it there was a tearing sound that sent
a clammy claw clutdiing down on my
heait muscles they tell you that men
falling from great heights relive their
lives in a flash like drowning men it
may be so with some but my mind was
a blank an adiing void as my body
arched back and shot into the bladcness
i believe i gave one shrill scream but im
not sure of that then-and ive no idea
how long it was since a second can con-
tain eternity under sudi conditions-i
crashed and the world went away from
all my senses

       rad u ally i became conscious of a
vj kind of blue-green luminosity sur-
rounding me i rememberwondering
whedier i had fallen into die sea and my
body was lying in some deep cool coral
cave absurd of course the sea was
miles away the moon must have come
out again i looked up and saw above
a roof of rough rock i realized that i
was lying across a sloping shoulder of
the same substance my legs straddling
it my arms hanging down on either side
of its curved surface while the not too
rounded peak of that bit into my back-
bone next i realized that i was stark
naked my shirt and shorts must have
been ripped away in the fall  i re-
membered the fall so i was still alive
and this must be some rocky cleft which
had caught and rolled me back under its
overhanging roof

  i was alive i started to lift my arms
intending to move to a more comfortable

position and it was then that real fear
caught at my throat and heart for i was
chained chained to the rock at neck
wrist thigh and ankle with thin sharp
chains strong as steel that bit into my
flesh at the least movement only the
neck chain being just above the collar-
bones allowed me to lift my head a lit-
tle and peer about me into the weird
blue-green luminosity seeking a cause
for my condition yet fearing to find it

  i saw that this was no mere cleft in
the rock but a long wide cavern with a
low roof directly before the rock to
which i was chained there was a sort of
rock throne tiny but large enough for
the grotesque figure which occupied it
he was perhaps two feet high a lei
of brightly colored flowers hung around
his scrawny throat and was lost beneath
his long gray beard he wore a colorful
waist-cloth nothing more his right
hand held a spear about the size of a
clothyard arrow

  surrounding him in a half moon
but at a respectful distance behind there
was a countless crowd of similar figures
some bearded and gray some smooth-
faced lithe and young all dressed in the
same manner as their king-for such i
took the seated figure to be-and all
armed with tiny weapons

  could this be a primitive race of
hawaiian pigmies still surviving un-
known to modern man hidden away in
these almost inaccessible caves or-
the truth flashed across my mind to be
dismissed as surest folly-could it be
true after all about the menehunes the
fairy people and had i fallen into their
power but surely fairy people would
be gentle and kindly they would not
crucify a stranger in chains upon their
rocks and stare at him with hard cold
unwinking brown eyes yet perhaps
they hated the white man and his crush-

ing civilization did i not hate it too
i must tell them that explain that i had
fled from it to their own land and then
their faces would glow with warm friend-
liness and they would hasten to release
the chains

  before i could speak there came a
voice so high and thin that i seemed to
be hearing it inside my own head rather
than through my ears yet i knew that it
came from the seated figure and i mar-
veled that its english was as perfect as
my own at its best

   stranger you venture to question our
hospitality

  a guess a logical deduction or had
he read my thought

  promptly came the reply your
thought speaks to me as mine to you
and now i will put to you another ques-
tion although without expectation that
you will answer it honestly what are the
limitations of hospitality shall a host
suffer his guest to destroy his property
and even the persons of those placed in
his charge yet withhold his hand because
of the claims of hospitality

  what was the meaning of this mad
rigmarole-i was not his guest nor he
my host but even if we stood in that re-
lation certainly i had destroyed none of
his property nor injured the persons of
any of his people    yet might i per-
haps have done so in a mad delirium
following my fall was that why i
came bade to consciousness to find myself
in chains

  again he read my thought you
have done no harm except to yourself
since you came to this place you have
my young men to thank that the harm
was no greater they caught you as you
fell and brought you here to me with
nothing but a few scratches and bruises
i started to stammer my thanks for-
getting my chains for the moment but i
guardians of the guavas



was interrupted coldly the words were
not well supplied you owe us no
thanks for your broken fall because we
drew yeu here and gave you the oppor-
tunity to fall you believe it to have
been your own idea born of moonlight
and curiosity but it came to you across
the valley from this cave carried on die
blue-green radiance which first attracted
your attention we summoned you here
to our court because a judgment has been
passed upon you and it is necessary to
its right execution diat you shall know
what it is and whence it came and why
i forgot my chains and diey bit sav-
agely at my flesh as i attemptedto rise
in my indignation what kind of court
is this that passes judgment in the ab-
sence of the defendant widiout hearing
his plea or admitting evidence

    it is a court in which no mental eva-
sions are at all possible the voice replied
more mildly than before though perhaps
it only seemed so in contrast to my own
hotness your crimes were committed
before our very eyes day after day
hundreds of us have seen and by thought
power have tried to check your mad de-
structiveness but it seemed that you re-
sponded to our impulses only by swing-
ing your blade faster and harder

   what in gods name could this lu-
natic be talking or rather thinking about
he answered me in two words the
guavas and i laughed aloud it was a
mad thing to do for the little old man
seemed serious enough but the idea of
being charged with the murder of wild
guava bushes

   my ill-judged mirth quite altered the
quality of the voice that continued to ring
in my head no longer had it even die
slightest suggestion of a thin silver flute
as before but rather that of an angry
bumblebee

    your laughter is evidence of the in-

credible obtuseness of your blundering
destructive murdering breed in your
blind arrogance you have at last succeed-
ed in persuading yourselves that you may
destroy what and where you will so that
it serves your comfort your pleasure or
your greed

   but i own the place on which i have
been clearing away the guavas i burst
in indignantly

   you own it the voice came high
and incredulous by what superior right
do you claim personal ownership of any
part of the kings domain granted in
common to his children in return for
their loving labor upon it

   what king are you talking about
i demanded petulantly i understand
that hawaii is a part of the republic of
the united states no king has any
rights here

   him whom we call the king has his
rights everywhere on land and sea and in
the air he is the king of the world
   but enough of that your thoughts no
less than your actions proclaim that you
know him not what of this absurd
claim to ownership which you advance
in defense of your murderous invasions
upon our sacred charges the guavas if
any truly own that land must it not be
the elemental spirits diat co-operated to
create the soil the earthworms that pre-
pared it for plant food the guavas them-
selves that laboriously-builded it into the
tissues of their living bodies-why have
they not better title to the land than you
they have been there for half a century
and you for little more than one moon
 but i bought and paid for the place
i protested with half-incredulous resent-
ment

   from what great chief did you buy
it with what act of splendid service
did you pay for it

  my temper was tiring of diis incred-


weird tales

ible conversation i bought it from the
legal owner and paid for it in hard cold
american dollars i answered shortly
realizing as i spoke that my adjectives
had not been well chosen

  sure enough he repeated them
hard cold but the hard may be softened
and the cold warmed by the white
flame whose ministers and servants are
we

  fortunately i had already learned that
the ancient hawaiians-those of them
who were deemed worthy of initiation
into their mysteries-worship the white
flame of the eternal life force or i might
have taken that last statement as a threat
of ordeal by fire perhaps it would have
been more pleasant after all than what
actually came

   pain and fear of pain said the
voice thus does the white flame
burn the dross out of the brains of be-
ings like yourself corrupted by the false
sense of the self separated from the one
self we may not kill-i drew a breath
of relief at that statement-we may not
ourselves execute the judgment of the
guavas upon your person but fortunate-
ly for the occasion we have humbler
ministers who are not so bound he
pronounced a name which i could not
spell if i could remember it but my re-
newed apprehension prevented me even
from paying attention to it what ter-
ror would be loosed upon me now

tn the utter silence of the cavern
a there came to my strained sense of
hearing a sound as of the scratching of
innumerable tiny claws upon the rock
crabs spiders what-an army of
them i felt a scratching at my left
ankle a procession of tiny claws rhythmi-
cally climbing to the bone

  pressing my throat to the utmost
against its chain i saw that which had
never before existed even in my imagi-

nation it was almost a foot in length
jetty black glistening black as though
carved out of polished hard rubber yet
every inch every atom of its contours
was tremendously horribly alive the
sense of the vitality packed into that small
compass was shocking i saw it more
dearly as it drew its dreadful length
across my kneecap it had a head but
no face its body was simply a proces-
sion of tiny claws mounted in black knobs
which moved with the regularity of some
mechanical thing up my thigh and to
my chest just below my throat it came
and there it paused

   we note with surprize that you are
not already acquainted with our little
friend said the voice with what seemed
to me to be dreadful irony were you
an hawaiian with some knowledge of
the land you presume to claim you would
have torn those chains deeply into your
own flesh at the sight of him before you
could recall that you were chained-and
you are chained you know

   what is it i croaked

  the response was disconcertingly
prompt it is the one being in this
land of love-excluding those like your-
self who are here by fraud or by force-
which rules and conquers all-even man
-by fear it is the great centipede

  a centipede-but those were tiny
pallid things never more than an inch
or so in length this giant waving his
blind tentacles almost at my throat and
opening and closing his mighty tail
shears with clearly audible sound was no
true centipede but rather a ghastly night-
mare of one seen through a blackened
and disordered brain magnified a mil-
lionfold

   it is not a vision said the voice
with gentle insistence it is an actual be-
ing as you shall soon have ample cause
to know

                       v t-

  so my fate was to be-stinging to
death by this hateful and malodorous in-
sect i felt a cold wind blow between
the epidermis and the dermis all over my
body and i fancied i could hear the hair
at the base of my head crackle as it rose
on end

  as though obeying some unspoken
command the nightmare insect renewed
its rhythmical march across my throat
over my chin and paused again only
when its blindly waving tentacles seemed
to command a view of my face

   look closely look well o king of
the centipedes said the voice for this
one lies under the curse of the centipedes
let it follow him let it pursue him till
he be frenzied with fear this for the
harm he has wrought let it follow let
it pursue till he lift the curse of his pres-
ence from our land and so-and only
so-lift the curse from himself this
for the harm that must not be wrought
by him

  as the voice ceased the mighty in-
sea deliberately turned about for a
second i saw the glistening plier-jaws
with which its tail was armed waving
threateningly beneath my very nose then
it resumed its rhythmical march over my
chin coming again to my throat where
it paused apparently with its head about
over one carotid artery and its terrible tail
over the other now if the insea were
indeed as deadly as the voice had sug-
gested it to be and if it were to be the
instrument of my destruaion it was in
position to spread its venom swiftly
throughout the blood stream

  the pause lengthened out intermi-
nably while the cavern was caught in
breathless silence not alone my nerves
were at unbearable tension but every ten-
don was tightly stretched every muscle
rock-hard tensed to receive and if pos-
sible to endure i knew not what fiendish
wt-

shock of awful agony this waiting
surely was worse than the event could
possibly be why did not the accursed
insea do its deadly work-or was it
perhaps awaiting the final command
from the king of the menehunes

  that command came like the crack
of a tiny pistol shot in the stillness it
was i think the same word with which
the awful insea had been summoned
but once again my nervous tension was
too great for me to pay attention to any-
thing but that instinctively as the com-
mand came i drew still tighter the al-
ready terrible tension of nerve and ten-
don and muscle something seemed to
snap there was a flashing blaze of
blue-white brilliance then blackness in-
stantaneous and absolute

t seemed to drift upward to the sur-
jl face of the sea of consciousness
through miles of blue-green water but
always with the same horrible sensation
of something dreadful and unclean cling-
ing about my throat the light grew
clearer yellower i became conscious of
my limbs pressing into the woven cane of
-the chair on my own lanai i was
there and dawn was just breaking over
the needles in the east-but these faas
were verbalized later for the time i
was frightfully conscious only of one sen-
sation-there was something clammy
and close-clinging like a necklace of tiny
tiger claws about my throat

  with a shrill scream i leapt to my
feet perhaps the scream the vibration
in my throat was what saved me for i
have learned since that these deadly in-
sects are apt to clamp down instinaively
upon feeling a sudden loss of support
there was a scratching thud on the ce-
ment floor of the lanai and there at my
feet eight or ten inches of liquid legs
churned and thrashed in blind semidr-


weird tales

cles then it straightened out and flowed
-toward me-for all the world like a
thick streak of black oil flowing down a
steeply sloping floor

  my first instinct was to leap upon it
with my shod feet and it was then that
i realized that my feet were not shod
that my body was as naked as it had been
in the cavern you will say-as the doc-
tor said-that it was all a dream brought
on by the actual contact of the real centi-
pedes claws but how will you account
for this fact that i was stark naked my
clothes were gone and i have never
found them to this day realizing my
defenseless condition i made no further
move toward the terror you may well
believe instead i dashed for the door
faster than i have ever run before yet
fast though i ran the cursed creature was
at my heels as i slammed the door be-
tween myself and it and sank with deep
sobbing breaths into an easy-chair

  god what a ghastly experience
dream nightmare or not - and i did
not stop to analyze then-at least there
was the fact of that giant centipede on
the doorstep outside if this lovely coun-
try was infested with such terrors would
it not prove more of a purgatory than a
paradise i seemed to hear the baffled
horror scratching scratching with its
tiny terrible claws at my door-and there
was a scratching louder and louder as i
listened intently but it was not at the
door-it was it was on the back of the
chair in which i lay exhausted

  i leapt to my feet again and in the
clear light of dawn saw another - or
could it possibly be the same-giant
centipede just flowing over the head-rest
where my head had rested a half-second
ago i sped to my bedroom i slammed
the door i stuffed ties and handkerchiefs
into the crack beneath it and into every
opening through which it seemed that

even an ant could make its way i threw
back the bedclothes and - yes i had
sensed that it would be inevitable-but
not one two of the giant centipedes lay
coiled together just under the front edge
of the pillow

  at the sight suprizingly enough i
lost my fear for the moment and grew
cold with rage i seized the first weapon
that came to hand-it happened to be a
shoe-and brought it down with terrific
force upon both of them it seemed im-
possible to kill them i seemed to pound
and pound at them for hours even after
they were ground into the sheet ruining
it forever still flickers and tremors of
horrible vitality shook the fragments as
though they would again unite and attack
me after that i stripped the bed turned
the mattress and lay down under the
single upper sheet after shaking it till i
almost tore the hem i lay there but not
to sleep no sooner would i close my
eyes than i would see armies of giant
centipedes flowing toward me through
the darkness and i would start up with
a half-suppressed scream

  fortunately there was but an hour or
so of that my japanese servant came at
seven had he been late that morning
he might have found a madman for a
master as it was i was dangerously irri-
table i cursed him for a sloven in per-
mitting these poisonous pests to get foot-
hold in my house in vain he protested
that he had seen none of the great centi-
pedes that they were indeed exceedingly
rare and that one might live a lifetime
in the islands and never see one had i
not seen four-no five counting the one
in the cavern-during that very night of
horror i seized the sheet and found the
dreadful remains of my battle and shook
it in his face

   see see for yourself i screamed
rather than spoke
guardians of the guavas



  he examined the remains carefully
and shook his head fhat danger he
said most danger - bite swell up
mebbe die dunno

  but the sole effect of the ocular dem-
onstration was that i lost my japanese
servant he slipped away shortly before
noon and i never saw him again

  well i dare not for my own sake
retrace the details of the next three days
they were one continuous nightmare
with the added horror of knowing clear-
ly that one was wide awake whenever
i turned wherever i turned my eyes
would fall upon one of these poisonous
pests i went about armed with a tightly
rolled magazine and got so that i would
strike out as i turned without waiting to
verify the presence of the pest that was
how all my crockery got broken when
my neighbor called-as he did near to
the end of the third day-it was that fact
that made him so sure that i must have
been drinking the native oke to the verge
of delirium tremens i told him the
whole tale as calmly as possible but that
only served to increase his conviction he
suggested that i had better let him take
me to town in his car-said he knew a
doctor knew the very place for me i
consented not because i needed a doctor
but just to get away

  i might have known that i couldnt
get away so easily as that the curse of
die centipedes was clearly in my mind
not till i left-not till i leave-these
islands shall i be free from it there was
one waiting for me on the pillow of the
hospital bed it slipped away like a
streak of black oil as i struck at it and
vanished through some crack in the base
boarding it was gone when the doctor
and the nurse turned at my scream i

showed them where it had been and
where i thought it had gone they were
interested and sympathetic - too much
so i could see that they were infected by
the belief of my neighbor the one who
had brought me to the hospital the doc-
tor says i shall be all right in a few days
or a week or two at most but i know
better the fact that these omnipresent
centipedes never seem to bite has brought
a certain dull apathy into my feeling
about them and yet i have a certain inner
sense that warns me to hold to my resolve
to leave the islands as soon as i can or a
secondary stage of the curse may man-
ifest

   i have sold my place at a great sacri-
fice in fact it brought me just a little
over the thousand i shall pay you when i
see you in a couple of weeks time

dear mr worthington the enclosed
letter or manuscript was found
under the pillow of the bed occupied by
your friend mr john hoxton during
his stay here at the hospital as you
already know from our cables he was
found dead by the night nurse and when
the body was lifted from the bed a giant
centipede was crushed around the back
of his neck the virus appears to have
entered at the carotids and in the en-
feebled state of the patient death must
have followed very quickly it is indeed
strange that his amazing illusion should
have been brought to a conclusion by a
real insea of the type he feared and it
is the more to be regretted because dr
benson was very hopeful of a complete
cure just the day before he had suc-
ceeded in convincing mr hoxton that he
must remain and fight and defeat this
fear here in the islands or it would leave
a permanent psychopathic complex

it cackled loathsomely as it advanced

on a dismal rainy afternoon in
august a tall very thin gentle-
man tapped timidly on the
frosted glass window of the curators
office in a certain new england museum
he wore a dark blue chinchilla over-
coat olive-green homburg hat with high
tapering crown yellow gloves and spats
a blue silk muffler with white dots en-
circled his neck and entirely concealed
the lower portion of his face and vir-
tually all of his nose only a small ex-
panse of pink and very wrinkled flesh
was visible above the muffler and below
his forehead but as this exposed portion
of his physiognomy contained his eyes it
was as arresting as it was meager so
arresting indeed was it that it command-
ed instant respect and the attendants
who were granted liberal weekly emolu-
ments for merely putting yards of red
tape between the main entrance and the
narrow corridor that led to the curators
office waived all of their habitual and


asinine inquiries and conducted the muf-
fled gentleman straight to what a vic-
torian novelist would have called the sa-
cred precincts

  having tapped the gentleman waited
he waited patiently but something in
his manner suggested that he was ex-
tremely nervous and perturbed and de-
cidely on edge to talk to the curator
and yet when the door of the office at
last swung open and the curator peered
out fastidiously from behind gold-
rimmed spectacles he merely coughed
and extended a visiting-card

  the card was conservatively fashion-
able in size and exquisitely engraved and
as soon as the curator perused it his
countenance underwent an extraordinary
alteration he was ordinarily a supreme-
ly reticent individual with long pale
face and lugubrious condescending eyes
but he suddenly became preposterously
friendly and greeted his visitor with an
effusiveness that was almost hysterical
a visitor from egypt



he seized his visitors somewhat flabby
gloved hand and gave it a babbittesque
squeeze he nodded and bowed and
smirked and seemed almost beside him-
self with gratification

  if only i had known sir richard
that you were in america the papers
were unusually silent-outrageously si-
lent you know i can not imagine how
you managed to elude the reporters
they are usually so persistent so inde-
cently curious i really can not imagine
how you achieved it

   

  i did not wish to talk to idiotic old
women to lecture before mattords to
have my photo reproduced in yotr ab-
surd papers sir richards voice was
oddly high-pitched almost effeminate
and it quivered with the intensity of his
emotion i detest publicity and i re-
gret that i am not utterly unknown in
this-er-region

  i quite understand sir rirhard
murmured the curator soothingly you
naturally desired leisure for research for
discussion you were not interested in
what the vulgar would say or think about
you a commendable and eminently
scholarly attitude to take sir richard
a splendid attitude i quite understand
and sympathize we americans have to
be polite to the press occasionally but
you have no idea how it cramps our
style if i may use an expressive but ex-
ceedingly coarse colloquialism it really
does sir richard you have no idea-
but do come in come in by all means
we are honored immeasurably by the
visit of so eminent a scholar

sir richard bowed stiffly and preceded
the curator into the office he se-
lected the most comfortable of the five
leather-backed chairs that encircled the
curators desk and sank into it with a
faintly audible sigh he neither re-

moved his hat nor withdrew the muffler
from his pinkish visage

  the curator selected a seat on the op-
posite side of the table and politely ex-
tended a box of havana panetelas ex-
tremely mild he murmured wont
you try one sir richard

  sir richard shook his head i have
never smoked he said and coughed

  there ensued a silence then sir
richard apologized for the muffler i
had an unfortunate accident on the ship
he explained  stumbled in one of
the deck games and cut my face rather
badly its in a positively unpresentable
condition i know youll pardon me if
i dont remove this muffler

  the curator gasped how horrible
sir richard i can sympathize believe
me i hope that it will not leave a scar
one should have the most expert advice
in such matters i hope-sir richard
have you consulted a specialist may i
ask

  sir richard nodded the wounds are
not deep-nothing serious i assure you
and now mr buzzby i should like to
discuss with you the mission that has
brought me to boston are the pre-
dynastic remains from luxor on exhibi-
tion

  the curator was a trifle disconcerted
he had placed the luxor remains on ex-
hibition that very morning but he had
not as yet arranged them to his satisfac-
tion and he would have preferred that
his distinguished guest should view them
at a later date but he very clearly per-
ceived that sir richard was so intensely
interested that nothing that he could say
would induce him to wait and he was
proud of the remains and flattered that
englands ablest egyptologist should
have come to the city expressly to see
them so he nodded amiably and cpn-
fessed that the bones were on exhibition


weird tales

and he added that he would be delighted
and honored if sir richard would view
them

  they are truly marvelous he ex-
plained the pure egyptian type-do-
lichocephalic with relatively primitive
features and they date-sir richard
they date from at least  b c

  are the bones tinted

  i should say so sir richard they
are wonderfully tinted and the original
colors have scarcely faded at all blue
and red sir richard with red predom-
inating

  hm a most absurd custom mur-
mured sir richard

  mr buzzby smiled i have always
considered it pathetic sir richard in-
finitely amusing but pathetic they
thought that by painting the bones they
could preserve the vitality of the cor-
ruptible body corruption putting on
incorruption as it were

  it was blasphemous sir richard
had arisen from his chair his face
above the muffler was curiously white
and there was a hard metallic glitter in
his small dark eyes they sought to
cheat osiris they had no conception of
hyperphysical realities

  the curator stared curiously pre-
cisely what do you mean sir richard

  sir richard started a trifle at the ques-
tion as though he were awakening from
some strange nightmare and his emo-
tion ebbed as rapidly as it had arisen
the glitter died out of his eyes and he
sank listlessly back in his chair i-
i was merely amused by your comment
as though by merely painting their mum-
mies they could restore the circulation of
the blood

  but that as you know sir richard
would occur in the other world it was
one of the most distinctive prerogatives
of osiris he alone could restore the
dead

  yes i know murmured sir richard
they counted a good deal on osiris it
is curious that it never occurred to them
that the god might be offended by their
presumptions

  you are forgetting the book of the
dead sir richard the promises in
that are very definite and it is an in-
conceivably ancient book i am strongly
convinced that it was in existence in
 b c you have read my brochure
on the subject

  sir richard nodded a very schol-
arly work but i believe that the book
of the dead as we know it was a for-
gery

  sir richard

  parts of it are undoubtedly pre-dy-
nastic but i believe that the judgment
of the dead which defines the judicial
prerogatives of osiris was inserted by
some meddling priest as late as the his-
torical period it is a deliberate attempt
to modify the relentless character of
egypts supreme deity osiris does not
judge he takes

  he takes sir richard

	precisely do you imagine anyone
can ever cheat death do you imagine
that mr buzzby do you imagine for
one moment that osiris would restore to
life the fools that returned to him

  mr buzzby colored it was difficult
to believe that sir richard was really in
earnest then you honestly believe
that the character of osiris as we know it
is-

  a myth yes a deliberate and child-
ish evasion no man can ever compre-
hend the character of osiris he is the
dark god but be treasures his own
eh mr buzzby was genuinely
startled by the tone of ferocity in which
the last remark was uttered what did
you say sir richard

  nothing sir richard had risen
and was standing before a small revolv-
a visitor from egypt



ing bookcase in the center of the room
nothing mr buzzby but your taste
in fiction interests me extremely i had
no idea you read young finchley

  mr buzzby blushed and looked gen-
uinely distressed i dont ordinarily
he said i despise fiction ordinarily
and young finchleys romances are un-
utterably silly he isnt even a passable
scholar but that book has-well- there
are a few good things in it i was read-
ing it this morning on the train and put
it with the other books temporarily be-
cause i had no other place to put it you
understand sir richard we all have
our little foibles eh a work of fiction
now and then is sometimes-er-well
suggestive and h e finchley is rath-
er suggestive occasionally

  he is indeed his egyptian redac-
tions are imaginative masterpieces
you amaze me sir richard imag-
ination in a scholar is to be deplored
but of course as i said h e finchley
is not a scholar and his work is occasion-
ally illuminating if one doesnt take it too
seriously

  he knows his egypt

   sir richard i cant believe you really

approve of him a mere fictionist-

  sir richard had removed the book and
opened it casually may i ask mr
buzzby if you are familiar with chapter

	the transfiguration of osiris
bless me sir richard i am not i
skipped that portion such purely gro-
tesque rubbish repelled me

  did it mr buzzby but the repel-
lent is usually arresting just listen to
this

   it is beyond dispute that osiris made his wor-
shipers dream strange things of him and that he
possessed their bodies and souls forever there
is a devilish wrath against mankind with which
osiris was for deaths sake inspired in the cool
of the evening he walked among men and upon
his head was the crown of upper egypt and his
cheeks were inflated with a wind that slew his
face was veiled so that no man could see it but

assuredly it was an old face very old and dead
and dry for the world was young when tall
osiris died

  sir orchard snapped the book shut and
replaced it in the shelf what do you
think of that mr buzzby he inquired

  rot murmured the curator sheer
unadulterated rot

  of course of course mr buzzby
did it ever occur to you that a god may
live figuratively a dogs life

  eh

  gods are transfigured you know
they go up in smoke as it were in
smoke and flame they become pure
flame pure spirit creatures with no visi-
ble body

  dear dear sir richard that had not
occurred to me the curator laughed
and nudged sir richards arm beastly
sense of humor he murmured to him-
self the man is unutterably silly

  it would be dreadful for example
continued sir richard if the god had no
control over his transfiguration if the
change occurred frequently and unex-
pectedly if he shared as it were the
ghastly fate of a dr jekyll and mr
hyde

  sir richard was advancing toward the
door he moved with a curious shuf-
fling gait and his shoes scraped peculiarly
upon the floor mr buzzby was in-
stantly at his elbow what is the mat-
ter sir richard what has happened
nothing sir richards voice rose in
hysterical denial nothing where is
the lavatory mr buzzby

  down one flight of stairs on your
left as you leave the corridor muttered
mr buzzby are-are you ill

  it is nothing nothing murmured
sir richard i must have a drink of
water that is all the injury has-er-
affected my throat when it becomes
too dry it pains dreadfully

  good heavens murmured the aura-
a

weird tales

tor i can send for water sir richard
i can indeed i beg you not to disturb
yourself

  no no i insist that you do not i
shall return immediately please do not
send for anything

  before the curator could renew his
protestations sir richard had passed
through the door and disappeared down
the corridor

mr buzzby shrugged his shoulders
and returned to his desk a
most extraordinary person he muttered
erudite and original but queer de-
cidedly queer still it is pleasant to re-
flea that he has read my brochure a
scholar of his distinaion might very par-
donably have overlooked it he called
it a scholarly work a scholarly work
hmm very gratifying im sure

  mr buzzby clipped and lit a cigar

  of course he is wrong about the
book of the dead he mused osiris
was a most benevolent god it is true
that the egyptians feared him but only
because he was supposed to judge the
dead there was nothing essentially
evil or cruel about him sir richard is
quite wrong about that it is curious
that a man so eminent could go so sensa-
tionally astray i can use no other
phrase sensationally astray i really
believe that my arguments impressed
him though i could see that he was
impressed

  the curators pleasant refleaions were
coarsely and unexpectedly interrupted by
a shout in the corridor get them ex-
tinguishers down quick you b-

  the curator gasped and rose hastily to
his feet profanity violated all the rules
of the museum and he had always firmly
insisted that the rules should be obeyed
striding quickly to the door he threw it
open and stared incredulously down the
corridor

  what was that he cried did
anyone call

  he heard hurried steps and the sound
of someone shouting and then an at-
tendant appeared at the end of the corri-
dor come quickly sir he exclaimed
theres fire and smoke cornin out of the
basement

  mr buzzby groaned what a dread-
ful thing to happen when he had such a
distinguished guest he raced down the
corridor and seized the attendant angrily
by the arm did sir richard get out
he demanded answer me is sir
richard down there now

  who gasped the attendant

  the gentleman who went down a
few minutes ago you idiot a tall gen-
tleman wearing a blue coat

  i dunno sir i didnt see nobody
come up

  good god mr buzzby was fran-
tic we must get him out immediate-
ly i believe that he was ill hes
probably fainted

  he strode to the end of the corridor
and stared down the smoke-filled stair-
case leading to the lavatory immediate-
ly beneath him three attendants were
cautiously advancing wet handker-
chiefs bound securely about their faces
proteaed them from the acrid fumes and
each held at arms length a cylindrical
fire extinguisher as they descended the
stairs they squirted the liquid contents of
the extinguishers into the rapidly rising
spirals of lethal blue smoke

  it was much worse a minute ago
exclaimed the attendant at mr buzzbys
elbow the smoke was thicker and
had a most awful smell like them
dinosaur eggs smelt when you first un-
packed em last spring sir

  the attendants had now reached the
base of the staircase and were peering
cautiously into the lavatory for a mo-
ment they peered in silence and then one
a visitor from egypt



of them shouted up at mr buzzby
the smokes dreadfully dense here sir
we cant see any flames shall we go
in sir

  yes do mr buzzbys voice was
tragically shrill do all you can
please

the attendants disappeared into the
lavatory and the curator waited with
an agonized and expectant air his
heart was wrung at the thought of the
fate which had in all probability over-
taken his distinguished guest but he
could not think of anything further to
do sinister forebodings crowded into
his mind but he was powerless to act

  then it was that the shrieks com-
menced from whatever cause arising
they were truly ghastly but they began
so suddenly so unexpectedly that at first
the curator could form no theory as to
what had caused them they issued so
horribly and suddenly from the lavatory
echoing and re-echoing through the
empty corridors that the curator could
only stare and gasp

  but when they became fairly coherent
when the screams of affright turned to
appeals for mercy for pity and when
the language in which they found grim
expression changed too becoming famil-
iar to the curator but incomprehensible
to the man beside him a dreadful inci-
dent occurred which the latter has never
been able to consign to a merciful mne-
monic oblivion

  the curator fell upon his knees liter-
ally went down upon his knees at the
head of the staircase and raised both arms
in an unmistakable gesture of supplica-
tion and then from his ashen lips
there poured a torrent of grotesque gib-
berish

  sdmw sm osiris sdmw stn osiris
sdmw stn osiris sdm-f osiris oh
sdm-f osiris sdmw stn osiris

  fool a muffled form emerged
from the lavatory and ponderously as-
cended the stairs fool you-you
have sinned irretrievably the voice
was guttural harsh remote and seemed
to come from an immeasurable distance

  sir richard sir richard the
curator got stumblingly to his feet and
staggered toward the ascending figure
protea me sir richard theres some-
thing unspeakable down there i thought
-for a moment i thought-sir richard
did you see it did you hear anything
those shrieks-

  but sir richard did not reply he
did not even look at the curator he
brushed past the unfortunate man as
though he were a mere meddling fool
and grimly began to climb the stairs that
led to the hall of egyptian antiquities
he ascended so rapidly that the curator
could not catch up with him and before
the frightened man had reached the half-
way landing his steps were resounding on
the tiled floor above

  wait sir richard shrieked buzzby
wait please i am sure that you can
explain everything i am afraid please
wait for me

  a spasm of coughing seized him and
at that moment there ensued a most
dreadful crash fragments of broken
glass tinkled suggestively upon the stone
floor and awoke ominous echoes in the
corridor and up and down the winding
stairway mr buzzby clung to the ban-
isters and moaned his face was pur-
plish and distorted with fear and beads
of sweat glistened on his high forehead
for a moment he remained thus cowering
and whimpering on the staircase then
miraculously his courage returned he
ascended the last flight three steps at a
time and dashed wildly forward

  an intolerable thought had abruptly
been born in the poor bewildered brain
of mr buzzby it had suddenly occurred


weird tales

to him that sir richard was an impostor
a murderous madman intent only upon
destruction and that his collections were
in immediate danger whatever mr buzz-
bys human deficiencies in his profession-
al capacity he was conscientious and ag-
gressive to an almost abnormal degree
and the crash had been unmistakable and
susceptible of only one explanation mr
buzzby completely forgot his fear in his
concern for his precious collections sir
richard had smashed one of the cases
and was extracting its contents there
was little doubt in mr buzzbys mind
as to which of the cases sir richard had
smashed the luxor remains can never
be duplicated he moaned i have
been horribly duped

  suddenly he stopped and stared at
the very entrance to the hall lay an as-
sortment of garments which he instantly
recognized there was the blue chin-
chilla coat and the alpine homburg
with its high tapering crown and the
blue silk muffler that had concealed so
effectively the face of his visitor and
on the very top of the heap lay a pair of
yellow suede gloves

  good god muttered mr buzzby
the man has shed all of his clothes
he stood there for a moment staring
in utter bewilderment and then with
long hysterical strides he advanced into
the hall a hopeless maniac he mut-
tered under his breath a sheer rav-
ing lunatic why did i not-

  then abruptly he ceased to reproach
himself he forgot entirely his folly
the heap of clothes and the smashed
case everything that had up to that
moment occupied his mind was instantly
extruded and he shriveled and shrank
with fear never had the unwilling gaze
of mr buzzby encountered such a sight

  mr buzzbys visitor was bending over
the shattered case and only his back was
visible but it was not an ordinary back

in a lucid unemotional moment mr
buzzby would have called it a nasty ma-
lignant back but in juxtaposition with
the crown that topped it there is no
aryan polysyllable suggestive enough to
describe it for the crown was very tall
and ponderous with jewels and unspeak-
ably luminous and it accentuated the vile-
ness of the back it was a green back
sapless was the word that ran through
mr buzzbys mind as he stood and stared
at it and it was wrinkled too horribly
wrinkled all crisscrossed with centuried
grooves

  mr buzzby did not even notice his
visitors neck which glistened and was
as thin as a bean-pole nor the small
round scaly head that bobbed and nodded
ominously he saw only the hideous
back and the unbelievably awesome
crown the crown shed a fiery radiance
upon the reddish tiles of the dim vast
hall and the starkly nude body twisted
and turned and writhed shockingly

  black horror clutched at mr buzzbys
throat and his lips trembled as though
he were about to cry out but he spoke
no word he had staggered back against
the wall and was making curious futile
gestures with his arms as though he
sought to embrace the darkness to wrap
the darkness in the hall about him to
make himself as inconspicuous as possi-
ble and invisible to the thing that was
bending over the case but apparently
he soon found to his infinite dismay that
the thing was aware of his presence and
as it turned slowly toward him he made
no further attempt to obliterate himself
but went down on his knees and
screamed and screamed and screamed

  silently the figure advanced toward
him it seemed to glide rather than to
walk and in its terribly lean arms it held
a queer assortment of brilliant scarlet
bones and it cackled loathsomely as it
advanced
the phantoms of the fire



  and then it was that mr buzzbys
sanity departed utterly he groveled and
gibbered and dragged himself along the
floor like a man in the grip of an instan-
taneous catalepsy and all the while he
murmured incoherently about how spot-
less he was and would osiris spare him
and how he longed to reconcile himself
with osiris

  but the figure when it got to him
merely stooped and breathed on him
three times it breathed on his ashen face
and one could almost see the face shrivel
and blacken beneath its warm breath

for some time it remained in a stooping
posture glaring glassily and when it
arose mr buzzby made no effort to de-
tain it holding the scarlet bones very
firmly in its horribly thin arms it glided
rapidly away in the direction of the stairs
the attendants did not see it descend
no one ever saw it again

  and when the coroner arriving in re-
sponse to the tardy summons of an at-
tendant examined mr buzzbys body
the conclusion was unavoidable that the
curator had been dead for a long long
time

a brief strange story

the phantoms
of the fire

  by clark ashton smith

it was late summer and the george-
town road was deep with dust which
had settled like a dun pall on die bor-
dering chaparral and pines since he had
walked all the way from auburn without
securing a single lift the man who was
trudging along the road with the broil-
ing afternoon sun on his back was hardly
less dusty than the trees he paused now
and then to mop his face with a discol-
ored handkerchief or to peer rather
wistfully at the occasional cars which
passed him without offering to stop his
clothing though not actually ragged
was old and worn and had the indescrib-
able shapelessness of clothing that has
been slept in he was very thin stoop-
 shouldered and discouraged-looking his

general aspect was almost that of a pro-
fessional tramp and the people of the
countryside were suspicious of tramps

  well i guess ill have t walk all the
way he said to himself whining a little
even in his thoughts but it aint much
further now    gosh but things is
hot an dry he looked about him at
the familiar landscape of parched grass
brushwood and yellow pines with an
appraising eye wonder there aint
been more fires-there alluz is at this
time o year

  the man was jonas mcgillicuddy and
he was on his way home after a some-
what prolonged absence his return was
unannounced and would prove as unex-
pected to his wife and three children as


weird tales

his departure had been tired of trying
to extort a living from a small vineyard
and pear-orchard of rocky el dorado
land and tired also of the perennial nag-
ging of his frail sensitive-nerved and
sorely disappointed wife jonas had left
abruptly three years before after a quar-
rel of more than customary bitterness and
acerbity with his helpmate since then
he had heard nothing from his family
for the good and sufficient reason that
he had not sought to communicate widi
them his various attempts to earn a
livelihood had proved scarcely more suc-
cessful than the fruit-ranching venture
and he had drifted aimlessly and ineffec-
tually from place to place from situation
to situation-a forlorn and increasingly
desperate figure for a man of such
shifting unstable temperament when all
else had failed him and he had wearied
of the hopeless struggle it was not un-
natural to think of returning time had
softened his memory of his wifes unde-
pendable temper of her shrewish out-
bursts but he had not forgotten her
motherly ways when she was in a more
tractable humor nor her excellent cook-
ing

  now with empty pockets since his
last money had sufficed merely to pay his
train-fare to sacramento jonas was near-
ing the hills inwhich lay his forest-sur-
rounded ranch beyond georgetown the
country through which he tramped was
sparsely peopled and there were great
stretches of softly rolling hills and low
valleys diat had not known the touch of
cultivation the ranches were often
quite isolated beyond all in the hazy
blue of the distance were the vague and
spectral snows of the sierras

  gosh but one of matildas pear
piesll taste good thought the wanderer
his mouth began to water he was not
reflective enough however to wonder
just what his reception would be beyond

an uneasy surmise that matilda might
give him a terrific scolding for his ab-
sence but mebbe shell be mighty glad
t see me after all he consoled himself
then he tried to picture his children the
five-year old boy and the girl-babies of
three and two respectively whom he had
last seen

   guess theyll have forgotten they had
a papa he mused the afternoon had
been utterly still and airless with a sul-
try brooding in its silence now from
the northeast along the road he was travel-
ling there came a gust of wind and with it
the unmistakable acrid odor of burnt grass
and trees

   hell there has been a fire after all
muttered jonas with an uneasy start he
peered anxiously ahead but could see no
smoke above the dun and gray-green
hills guess its all out now anyway

  he came to the top of the low slope
he was climbing and saw before him the
burnt area which lay on both sides of die
road and was of indeterminable extent
the brown foliage of heat-seared oaks
and the black skeletons of bushes and
pines were everywhere a few fallen logs
and old stumps were still smoking a little
as is their wont for days after the ex-
tinguishment of a forest fire it was a
scene of complete and irremediable deso-
lation

  jonas hurried on with a sense of
growing panic for he was now little
more than a mile from his own property
he thought of the yellow pines that
stood so close and tall about his cabin-
the pines which he had wished to fell
but had spared at the earnest solicitation
of the nature-loving matilda

  theyre so pretty jonas she had
said pleadingly i just cant see them

go

  hope the fire didnt get into them
pines thought jonas now gosh but i
wish id cut em down when i wuz
the phantoms of the fire



plannin to it would have been a lot
safer and id have had the money for
the wood too

  the road was strewn in places with
ashen leaves with the charcoal of fallen
brands and several trees had crashed
across it but had now been removed to
permit the passage of traffic it was hot-
ter than ever in this charred and black-
ened waste for the brief gust of wind
had fallen the dust on jonas cheeks
was runneled with sweat which he no
longer paused to wipe away irrespon-
sible as he was a strange gravity had
come over the wastrel and he felt an
ever-deepening premonition of calamity

  he came at last to the little by-road
which turned off to his ranch from the
georgetown highway here he found
with a sinking heart the fire had also
been and had left nothing but devasta-
tion in spite of his fatigue he almost
ran with long shambling steps and
rounding a turn in the by-road saw that
the fire had stopped at the very verge of
his own property the hillside orchard
of stunted pear trees the straggling vines
of mission and muscat grapes were quite
as he remembered them and beyond in
the grove of yellow pines he could see
the wreathing smoke that arose from the
chimney of his cabin panting heavily
he paused with a sense of relief and
thanksgiving as poignant as anything of
which his dulled heart was capable

  the sun had almost touched the
horizon as he climbed the winding road
through the orchard and entered the
grove above aisles of light perceptibly
tinged with gold lay between the elon-
gated shadows even to the sodden in-
sensitive jonas the beauty of the wood-
jand scene the magic of the sunset the
high solemn dark-green pines and the
rich glow sifting among them on man-
zanita-bushes and beds of brown needles
were not without their charm he drew

a long breath inhaling the clean balsams
that the hot sun had drawn from the for-
est and feeling as he did so a vague
pleasure

  now he could see his cabin a long
four-roomed shack of plain unpainted
boards and weather-darkened shingles a
woman in calico was standing in front of
the steps two little girls were beside
her and he wondered as to the where-
abouts of the boy who had been a fragile
youngster always ailing and fretful
mebbe bill is sick agin mused jonas
he was very glad to be home but he felt
a little doubtful a trifle tremulous as to
the greeting he would receive from ma-
tilda

  the woman looked up as he ap-
proached shading her eyes with her hand
from the last rays of the sun which fell
horizontally through the wood he could
see her apron which was quite clean as
always though worn and faded from
many washings like her dress she did
not seem to perceive him but was appar-
ently staring with great intentness at
something among the trees the chil-
dren also stared and huddled closer to
her clinging to the hem of her gown

  jonas tried to call out hello matil-
da but his throat was so dry and dusty
that the words were no more than a
hoarse whisper he started to clear his
throat but the simple act was never fin-
ished for at that moment the whole
scene before him the trees the cabin the
woman and the children were lost in a
roaring sheet of ruddy flame that seemed
to come from all sides at once and blot
out the entire world and the very sky as
it towered full-grown in what could have
be no more than the fraction of a sec-
ond a blast of intolerable heat fierce
as the breath of a thousand furnaces blew
in jonas face and swept him backward
like a hurricane the mighty roaring
pounded in his ears like a sea and was


weird tales

mingled with human screams as he went
down into pitch-black gulfs of uncon-
sciousness

it was day when jonas awoke but he
was too confused for a few instants to
realize that the light was slanting through
the tree-tops from a different direction
or that there was more of it than seemed
normal in an evergreen forest when
his wits returned sufficiently to permit
the comprehension of the faa that it was
morning he began to notice other things
that were equally singular he found
that he was lying on his back among
burnt needles and above him towered
the dark boles of fire-swept trees with
the pitiful stumps of their cauterized
branches darkly indistinaly in a sort
of dull astonishment he began to re-
membev the events of the previous day
his return at sunset to the cabin his
glimpse of matilda and the two children
and die all-engulfing sheet of flame he
looked instinaively at his clothes with
the feeling that he must have been badly
burnt but there was no trace of fire on
his raiment and the black ashes about
him were cold nor when he reared
himself on his elbow and peered around
was there the faintest thread of smoke to
indicate a recent conflagration

   he arose and stepped toward the place
where the cabin had stood it was a heap
of ashes from which protruded the ends
of charred beams

  my god muttered jonas he felt
utterly dazed and his thoughts refused to
aline themselves failing to form any sort
of intelligible order

  as jonas spoke a man arose from
where he had been stooping behind the

wreckage of the cabin furtively dropping
some objea which he held in his hands
seeing jonas the man came forward
hastily he was a gaunt individual in
dirty overalls with the profile and the
general air of a somewhat elderly and
dilapidated buzzard jonas recognized
him as samuel slocum one of his neigh-
bors

  wal jonas mcgillicuddy so youve
come back explained this individual in
raucous tones of unfeigned surprize
yere a little too late though he went
on without pausing to let jonas speak
everythin burnt up clean four days
ago

  but the cabin wuz here las night
stammered jonas i came through the
woods bout sunset an i saw matilda an

the story thus far

landing safely on the planet mars after a voyage
from earth professor hervy and his daughter
hath send joseph kiser the third member of their
party to reconnoiter the martian city which lies
across the canal kiser is captured by kabo a mar-
tian scientist who transplants kisers pineal gland
into the brain of a marb one of a race of sub-
men who live on mars kisers memory is thus
transferred to the body of a marb and the marbs
intelligence is transferred to kisers body professor
hervy and ruth are hospitably received by the mar-
tians who know nothing of kabos perfidy nebond
the marb whose intelligence has been transplanted
into kisers body abducts ruth and carries her into
the forest where the rest of the marbs live kabos
niece delam oblene learns of kabos terrible experi-
ment and he transplants her intelligence into the
body of a female marb to prevent her informing
the council of his deed she and kiser in the bodies
of the two marbs are then marooned on phobus one
of the moons of mars

he grasped the rope
before the noose had
tightened upon him

	a phobian tribunal

the realization that the female
marb marooned with him upon
the desolate martian satellite was
none other than the beautiful delam
oblene and that on his account she had
been transformed by her heartless uncle
into a grotesque beast caused kiser a dis-
tinct thrill of apprehension regarding her
probable danger at the hands of the res-
cue-men-or the phobians as they might
more properly be called

   where had she found shelter from the
ravages of the weather how had she
avoided the very apparent wrath of the
phobians what might they not attempt
to do to her now that she had been the
means of their failure in their attack

upon him

this story began in weird tales for july




weird tales

  kiser opened the door of his cabin and
strode out once more intent upon find-
ing delam oblene and attempting to
reach some understanding with her he
must assist her to provide a shelter for
herself and it had best be near his own
for their mutual protection

  the rain had ceased and he walked at
once to the shore of the lava lake here
he found no trace of her whom he
sought although he walked for some dis-
tance back and forth along the margin
of the forest calling her name

  when he had explored as far as he
thought she might have ventured and
was on the verge of turning back toward
his cabin he heard a slight noise above
him and glanced up just in time to see
one of the phobians cast a lariat which
sailed with unerring precision and settled
about his neck

  having seen it coming he grasped the
rope before the noose had tightened upon
him and with a quick puli which took his
adversary completely by surprize he dis-
lodged the fellow from his footing in
the tree and stretched him sprawling and
wounded upon the ground near by

  there was a severe cut on the creatures
arm which was bleeding profusely kiser
bound it with strips cut from his own
tunic as the phobians clothing was of
skins and would not serve his purpose

  this task was performed while the
wounded phobian lay helpless but quite
conscious and he gazed at kiser without
any show of emotion whatsoever

  when he had finished bandaging the
wound kiser placed the phobian in as
comfortable a position as possible added
the rope to his equipment and went back
to his cabin to spend a restless night of
anxiety regarding delam oblene regret-
ing her fearful misfortune inflicted be-
cause of her attempt to intercede in his
behalf and fearing lest she might suffer
from exposure or attack

  he pictured the horror of her position
a refined beautiful and highly intellectual
maiden forced to occupy the physical
body of a horrid marb whose brain was
so constructed as to limit her mental ac-
tivity she could not communicate with
her friends by means of telepathy be-
cause the brain-mechanism by means of
which that wonderful feat was accom-
plished by the martians was lacking in
the marb neither could she remember
her previous incarnations except prob-
ably such experiences as she might have
happened to discuss during her existence
as a martian

  early the next morning he renewed his
quest and again he failed to find any
trace of her near the lava lake he called
her name often and loudly but to no
avail

  he berated himself for not having
guessed her identity from the first she
had as good as told him that she was
delam oblene and yet for many days he
had been blinded to the truth

kiser had ventured some distance into
the forest and for some time he had
not called out suddenly he heard
voices he stopped to listen there could
be no mistake it was the jumbled and
distant sound of conversation

  he drew cautiously nearer until he
came upon the opening of a cave this
opening was guarded by one of the pho-
bians who appeared to have been placed
there as a sentinel and he dared not ap-
proach too near

  crouching behind the verdure in an
effort to see and yet remain unseen he
suddenly felt a paroxysm of severe pain
in his hand which almost caused him to
cry out upon investigation he found
that he had touched another of the nu-
merous nettle trees such as the one he
had encountered upon that first day upon
the satellite this one was much larger

earthworms of karma



however and was loaded with large yel-
low fruit resembling the tomato this
was the terrible tear gas fruit with
which the phobians had meant to sere-
nade him in his cabin

  he plucked several of these tear-gas
tomatoes as he chose to name them
and placed them in a near-by spot for his
own convenience in case he might need
them

  presently another of the phobians
came to the opening of the cave and held
a brief conversation with the sentinel
he spoke in a commanding tone and
pointed in the direction of the lava lake
evidently he was one in authority for the
sentinel at once set out in the direction
indicated and the other disappeared in-
side the cave

  the rendezvous of the phobians was
left unguarded should he attempt to go
closer he did not know when the for-
mer sentinel might return nor that an-
other might not be sent from within to
replace him but after some moments his
curiosity overcame his caution and filling
his pockets with tear tomatoes he crept
forward to the entrance of the cave and
stepped inside

  there was a high narrow tunnel ex-
tending back some ten feet where it
opened into a large amphitheater with
many ledges or seats rising in terrace
fashion from the center toward all four
sides these seats appeared to have
been hewn out of solid stone they were
about twenty inches wide each being
some two feet above the next one in
front with gradually sloping aisles ap-
proaching each of the four corners the
widest narrowing into the exit in which
he stood and upon these seats were about
forty of the savage phobians conducting
what appeared to be some form of
tribunal

  the amphitheater was well lighted by

means of ereat luminous balls of some
wt-

phosphorescent substance suspended from
overhead and seated in the ten-foot
square of level floor in the center of the
chamber her hands securely bound and
a blind placed about her eyes was the
grotesque marb which he now felt so cer-
tain was delam oblene while at either
side of her stood one of the gross phobians
and each was talking in loud quarrelsome
tones they gesticulated and pounded
themselves on their chests until the en-
closed amphitheater fairly reverberated
with the echo they were undoubtedly
engaged in a heated argument though
what the point of contention was kiser
could not guess they both talked at
once and yet somehow their listeners
appeared to have no difficulty on this ac-
count and they seemed to understand

   at sight of delam oblenes plight a
cold rage filled kisers heart he clutched
the largest of the tear tomatoes and for-
getful of its probable effect upon delam
oblene threw it with all his strength
dashing it to fragments upon the face of
one of the orators then before any-
one knew what had happened he dealt
the other a like blow upon his chest

   there was a howl of pain from both
victims of his marksmanship and both
went down with hands to eyes while oth-
ers scampered back in an effort to escape
the pungent fumes which were now per-
meating the air

  now thoroughly aroused to action
kiser dashed another of the miniature
gas bombs into the face of still another
of the creatures who had gained the en-
trance to the tunnel and sent him screech-
ing back into the arms of those behind
him

   the din inside the amphitheater now
became an uproar of screaming cough-
ing and the shuffling of many feet for
the phobians wore heavy wooden shoes
not wishing to injure the marb whom he
sought to rescue kiser now withheld his


weird tales

rain of vegetable gas bombs but stood
threateningly guarding the entrance of
the cave

  but kiser had reckoned without con-
sideration for the skill of the phobians
with the lariat and even in the narrow
confines of the tunnel he soon found
himself neatly lassoed he was dragged
forward into the gas-filled chamber
where he was thrown rudely to the floor
and securely bound

  as he entered the amphitheater the ir-
ritating gas from his bombardment filled
his eyes and nostrils and he strangled
and went temporarily blind but not be-
fore he had seen that all the phobians
remaining in the chamber wore a rude
appliance over their faces and that the
huge marb whom he believed to be delam
oblene lay in the center of the amphi-
theater apparently unconscious the
phobians had hurriedly procured their
gas masks donned them and were pro-
tected from his attack-the only ones he
had injured were the three whom he
struck and delam oblene if indeed this
animal were she

  kiser suffered untold agonies before he
was again able to open his eyes and then
as he glanced about him he saw several
of the phobians spraying some sort of
fluid into the atmosphere of the room
presumably to annul the effects of the
tear fruit the other marb was begin-
ning to awake and several of the pho-
bians had removed their gas masks the
three whom he had injured had appar-
ently been carried out for they were no-
where to be seen but the others began
to gather about them when it was seen
that they were fully conscious

  just what was going to happen to
them-or at any rate to kiser-there
could be but little doubt for these strange
creatures began to clamor for vengeance
and many of them had unsheathed their
knives while he lay bound and quite help-

less and had it not been so it could
have made but little difference for when
he felt the strength of the creature who
had so easily tossed him upon the floor
he knew that even had he had his earth-
ly sinews he would have been no match
for one of these phobians

  as the howling crowd grew closer and
more clamorous the same phobian whom
kiser had encountered upon the margin
of the lava lake stepped into the amphi-
theater instantly all noise was hushed
and each of the savage creatures stepped
back with an air of deference

  he walked with a slight limp and he
still wore the dressing which kiser had
placed upon his arm when this crea-
ture unsheathed his long knife kiser
thought surely that his time to die had
come indeed but the phobian stooped
cut the rope which bound kisers hands
and feet and assisted him to his feet

  the other marb was dealt with in like
manner and the two were then conducted
to the exit of the cave and released ap-
parently with the assurance that they
would not be further molested

  whatever else might be said of the
phobians it was certain that this one who
appeared to be one in authority was not
without gratitude and appreciation

  by means of gestures and much argu-
ment kiser prevailed upon the huge marb
to start the erection of a cabin like his
own a few paces from it

	pilluth learns

both anhui pilluth and frambrozo
himnun had been suitors for the
hand of delam oblene but being a
highly skilled microscopist and having
mapped out a career for herself she had
rejected both and given her undivided at-
tention to her work

   pilluth had spent three years since his
graduation from the university as kabos
earthworms of karma



assistant and this training had developed
him into a worthy scientist and entitled
him to a commission from the council
for die asking yet he had not meant
to make application for a commission had
kabos niece not suddenly left keto or
at any rate pilluth was informed that she
had been permanently removed to norb
during one of his short vacations

  this caused the younger man to alter
his plans and he at once made applica-
tion for a commission and on the very
day that he received it came the news of
delam oblenes death and the arrival of
her ashes from norb

  as cremation was compulsory and
must be done before a corpse may be
shipped no one questioned the identity
of the ashes in the urn and both of the
lovers mourned delam oblene as lost
without entertaining the remotest idea
that there might have been foul play

  true both pilluth and himnun had
attempted to communicate with her after
her departure from keto and had been
unable to do so this was very perplex-
ing and they wondered but neither made
any effort to investigate and when the
news of her death was received both si-
lently conceded that she was probably ill
and the seeming discrepancy was all but
forgotten

  pilluth had made arrangements to open
a laboratory of his own under his com-
mission but deferred his arrangements to
move until after the interment and on
the heels of this incident came nebonds
escape from his hovel and the consequent
report that the missing man had been dis-
covered and lost again which served to
remind pilluth of the fearful injustice
which had been done and sent him to visit
kabo after having expressed his grati-
tude and appreciation for the guidance
and advice he had received at the hands
of the older man he said regarding this
earthman whom we so grossly wronged

is there not some means by which we
might restore him that is a thing i do
not wish to weigh upon my conscience
let us extract a promise from him that
he will not reveal our duplicity and re-
store him to his rightful body he
would most certainly be more than will-
ing to bargain for restoration

  that my friend is impossible you
have no conception of the malice borne
us by that degenerate restored to his
earth-body with its enormous strength
he would wreak upon us the most terrible
vengeance his puny mentality could con-
ceive no i regret the incident as much
as you but it can not be adjusted now
but do you not think he would bar-
gain with us for his release he must
realize by now how helpless he is
bargain indeed yes he would bar-
gain with us and what means the
promise of an earthling

  you are unduly embittered against
everything pertaining to the earth re-
member that you and i are but a single
step in evolution above the earthlings
but a comparatively short time ago you
yourself were an earthling and i dare
say less well developed than this one if
i am any judge this earthman can be
trusted

  pardon me my dear pilluth but there
is much that you forget there are no
earthlings that may be trusted is it not
their untrustworthiness that plunges them
into the throes of misery look at their
greed loook at their deceit look at
their sensuality why a man devoid of
these traits of character could not live
half a year upon the earth during my
own earth life i was the same as the
others i was taught these cursed traits
of character from infancy to my so-called
death and i cheated lied swindled and
hated as the earthlings must ever do
no his word could not be trusted we
have him in our power now and we must
ill

weird tales

keep him so had you understood eng-
lish and heard the vindictive threats he
made against us the day we visited him
in his bed you would not be so generously
inclined the men of earth live only
for greed and vengeance

  but sir on masovada we presume to
have no such traits here none are so vile
save you and me-for are we not deceiv-
ing the council of masovada are we
not cowards that we hide behind this
poor unfortunates misfortune to save
ourselves from the wrath of our fellow
men was it not greed for scientific
knowledge that prompted us to commit
this crime in the first place

  alas pilluth you speak truly and
well all of these facts i have pondered
in remorse of soul in agony of soul i
sorrow that this thing has gone beyond
the possibility of reparation but it is so
it is all honor to you pilluth that you
wish to right this wrong but it can not
be to restore these two would be our
ruin-my death and disgrace for you
forever

  why do you say these two pilluth
was gazing into the others eyes as if to
read his innermost thoughts

  nebond has been wronged equally
with the earthling quickly responded
kabo his face going deadly pale how
much had pilluth read of that which had
involuntarily flashed into his mind

  without further argument the young
man took leave of his preceptor and went
to his room to pack his belongings pre-
paratory to going away when he had
finished this task something prompted
him to take one last look about the
grounds he was not satisfied with
kabos answer to his request that the
earthling be restored and he desired to
see once more the horrible result of the
double operation so he strolled alone
about the enclosure reviewing the results
of various experiments and making some

notes regarding each

  he visited the hovel where nebond
was confined but nowhere could he find
the marb bearing the personality of
joseph kiser he searched the entire
garden until no portion remained save
the isolated hovel where kabo had con-
ducted his private laboratory and whither
all others were forbidden to go

  pilluth hesitated to approach this build-
ing for two reasons first he had always
respected kabos wishes in this respect
and was inclined to do so now and sec-
ond he feared that kabo might see him
the remembrance of the look on kabos
face however when he had made what
pilluth was sure was an unintentional re-
mark spurred him on and he determined
to investigate and if the earthman could
speak german to have a talk with him
too he felt that he had a right at least
to converse with the earthling if it were
possible to do so for was he not equally
guilty of the crime kabo had been be-
trayed while he had lived upon the earth
and he was unduly and unjustly embit-
tered against the earth and its inhab-
itants pilluth wanted to feam what
terms the earthman would agree to

  reaching the door of the small build-
ing he knocked for a moment there
was no response and he knocked a sec-
ond time from within came a queru-
lous protest in the accents of a marb but
the pitch of the voice was that of a hu-
man being and a martian female at that
why do you come knocking it is not
yet time for my food and if it were why
do you not fetch it to the slot instead of
disturbing my sleep at this hour go
away i do not want the food you fetch
me anyhow you refuse me the herbs and
worms i desire and force upon me your
own rotten food why dont you bring
me the kind of food i want if you
would please me fetch worms - fetch
worms
earthworms of karma



  for a moment pilluth stood as if
stunned what martian woman had
kabo performed his terrible experiment
upon he knew this was not kiser for
this creature had spoken the martian lan-
guage and again the voice had been
unmistakably feminine what could the
answer be nebond he had seen already

  pilluth got a large stone hastily broke
the lock on the door and forgetful of
any danger to himself swung the heavy
portal wide one look inside and he ut-
tered a cry of horrified amazement for
slouched ungracefully upon a crude bed
at the opposite side of the small room
lay delam oblene

  blinking at the unaccustomed light
which had suddenly flooded her dismal
chamber she stared at the astonished
pilluth without the slightest sign of
recognition although she was more than
half naked there was no sign of confu-
sion in her manner nothing of intelli-
gence in her eye at length as he con-
tinued to stare at her in utter amazement
she bared her teeth and growled

  at this pilluth recoiled as from a blow
in the face then with arms outstretched
he stepped toward her my darling
kabo told me you were dead-what-
what-dont you know me delam ob-
lene he attempted to take her hand and
she snatched it away then with a vicious
snarl she bent forward and her teeth
snapped together with great force barely
missing his outstretched hand as he re-
coiled with horror against the half-open
door

  how-how can you act like that
dont you know me delam oblene
that is not my name i am juak
now i am going to run amuck i shall
kill you if you do not stand aside

  no you are not juak you are mad
of course you are not juak you are de-
lam oblene and you can not kill me
because i am stronger than you why has

kabo imprisoned you here until he has
undermined your reason come pull
yourself together now and think

  i tell you i am juak i am going to
run amuck now i will-will-no no
its no use i have lost all my strength
kabo has changed me into a weak thing
that can not even have an occasional
amuck look at my arms white and
so small what are they good for look
at my legs she displayed unblushingly
a very shapely pair of limbs they are
too long and too small and too white
my body looks as though it had been
shaved kabo has spoiled me and if i
only had the strength to run amuck 
would kill you first and then kill kabo

  in his surprize at seeing delam ob-
lene pilluth had forgotten for the
moment about kabo and his soul-trans-
ference now he remembered and sud-
denly the realization of the terrible truth
came to him kabo had performed his
hideous operation upon delam oblene
and had thus transferred her mentality to
the body of a marb this creature with
which he was conversing was juak a
female marb which had possession of
delam oblenes body

  his feeling as this realization came to
him was at first a sense of dreadful sick-
ening horror his hands shook his lips
trembled and something seemed to rise
up in his throat as if to choke him this
feeling rapidly gave way to intense anger
toward the heartless perpetrator of the
infamous deed for this outrage kabo
must be punished-swiftly surely and
terribly he must be made to suffer even
as delam oblene had suffered - but
where was the real delam oblene

  my god wailed pilluth the
heartless infamous damnable brute i
had not dreamed that anyone could be so
base never before in all my masovadan
experience have i undertaken to avenge
myself upon any living creature but this


weird tales

is too much he shall pay by god he
shall pay

  juak was watching him with amuse-
ment you will run amuck she asked
with delight you will kill kabo
anhui pilluth looked pityingly at the
creature and a great sob rose in his
throat the superb form the delicate
pink skin was that of the maiden he had
loved but from her eye now shone only
the intelligence of juak the filthy female
marb his hurt was too great to express
in words so he did not speak but just
stared at her in mute dumfounded an-
guish his feelings mingled tenderness
pity and horror for this creature who was
and yet who was not delam oblene and
an intense resentment toward kabo who
was the author of her present predic-
ament his thoughts flew back to the
delam oblene he had known as he con-
tinued to stare at this creature before him
and with the refinement the maidenly
modesty and the simple sweetness of the
one compared the lowly sloven unkempt
baseness of the other and his blood
seemed to freeze within him as he re-
called her words worms worms
fetch worms

  it was a thoroughly aroused pilluth
who strode out of juaks shanty repaired
the broken lock and fastened the door
he could as yet formulate no definite
plan of action however for he had no
idea where kabo had hidden the other
two victims of his perfidy - the marb
forms of delam oblene and joseph
kiser his first thought was to rush at
once to kabo and demand an explana-
tion but on second thought he rejected
this plan for he reasoned that such a
course of action would only serve to
warn kabo that his crime against his
niece had been discovered and thus put
him on his guard and perhaps stimulate
him to further attempt at crime he
would demand an explanation of kabo

only as a last resort to find the imprisoned
souls of delam oblene and the earthman

	beck protests

since there were none in the tribe who
might mate with beck and since beck
was too old to forage successfully in other
tribes for a mate and lacked the courage
to protest with the conquerer of the
mighty pleck for having purloined pike
this surly marb looked with favor upon
ruth of course beck knew that she had
none of the charm and rare beauty so
manifest in his lost pike but even such a
hollow-eyed pink-skinned female as she
would probably be better than no mate
at all for to be sure someone must pro-
vide his food for him beck was proud
and he knew the other marbs would taunt
and tease but also he had a vigorous ap-
petite and he was very lazy rather than
forage for himself he must put his pride
aside for would they not taunt anyhow
should he start providing for himself

  he approached ruth with his most
affectionate growl which was also his
most commanding for he was not aware
of her participation in the fight with
pleck come to me you imp of perdi-
tion he said affectionately you are
not much to look upon but if you pro-
vide for me well perhaps i shall not beat
you except when i run amuck

  when ruth drew back he growled
even more fiercely do not anger me
further he roared is it not enough
that i must accept you at all come
but she did not come and beck began
to foam at the mouth while the tribe
crowded about to see the fun and the
pending encounter promised to be very
interesting too for had not this strange
female all but bested pleck but the
slothful beck did not know this

  ruth had backed away from him and
stood trembling although she must have
earthworms of karma



known that she possessed far greater
physical strength than the best of them
while nebond stood regarding them with
the air of a disinterested onlooker

  the beast was greatly surprized and
angered when ruth evaded his first
charge and gave him a shove which sent
him staggering many steps backward
while the other marbs taunted him with
delight

  he charged at her again and with re-
newed fury but when his long arm shot
toward her she lightly stepped aside and
seizing his arm with both her hands she
deftly attempted to bend it the wrong
way-as she had seen kiser do upon that
memorable day of their landing

  beck uttered a hoarse scream of an-
guish and drew back nursing the
wounded member and glaring at ruth
with intense hatred the marbs taunted
him with frantic glee dancing and hop-
ping about in their delight with shrill
sounds which very nearly approximated
laughter but beck had had enough of
the affray so he slunk away into the for-
est muttering and grimacing in his rage
and discomfiture

  nor did he stop at the canal shore
he plunged into the water and swam
across into the city of keto there he
hailed the first martian he saw and re-
quested that he communicate with the
chief of the council in behalf of the un-
fortunate tribe of marbs who had been
invaded by a strange being with sunken
eyes and such savage strength that many
of them had been killed and the others
subjected to much oppression

   from becks account of the situation it
was at once recognized that the mad
earthman was among them and fram-
brozo himnun was notified

  very soon himnun professor hervy
and unel kabo were on the scene and
after questioning the marb at some length
the three armed themselves with a stro-

tan ray machine and kandiked to the
habitat of plecks-or rather nebonds
tribe

  here they found the marbs lounging
about in the sunshine seemingly quite
well content with the new order of things
the dead had been disposed of by being
thrown into a deep crevice and none
appeared to resent the intrusion into their
midst of a creature of strange form who
had wrought such havoc among them but
a few hours before

  nebond lolled among them as lazy as
dirty and quite as loathsome with his un-
washed blood-stained hands as were the
others but ruth was nowhere to be seen

  as the kandike landed near them ne-
bond arose and approached them when
he had drawn quite near he stopped and
began pounding his chest with his fists

  kabos face went dead white when this
creature addressed them in the martian
tongue i am nebond and nebond does
not fear the masovadans if you attempt
to take nebond back into captivity ne-
bond will kill all of you nebond is
very strong far stronger than any other
marb that ever lived and you had best
leave nebond alone go now before i
run amuck and kill the three of you
nebond and his tribe will suffer no in-
terference from the masovadan council

  without further ado kabo brought the
strotan ray machine into play and ne-
bond fell limp and inert to the ground
even as he started to charge them in the
frightful amuck of a martian marb

  the earthman has been among the
marbs all the while i wonder why they
have not reported his presence said
kabo as he approached the slowly re-
treating colony of marbs

  where is the girl he brought into the
forest with him asked himnun of one
of the beasts who had not bolted into the
forest when nebond fell

  she left the tribe as soon as she had
 

weird tales

bested beck replied the marb she
went in that direction-he pointed east
then nodded toward the inert form of
nebond-and he forbade any of us to
follow her he said she was a dangerous
she and had best be allowed to go where
she chose

  has this creature been with you be-
fore asked himnun

  we never saw him nor his like before
today he came to us claiming that he
was nebond who was taken into captiv-
ity many many small-moons ago for hav-
ing run amuck and injured a masovadan
but he is not nebond-he is not even a
marb as you can see but fight you
should have seen him slay pleck and zib
and liko and ube and the others of
plecks family it was very amusing
undoubtedly you enjoyed it im-
mensely but now we must find the girl
who is the leader of this tribe now
who else honorable councilor but
lune lune is the greatest of all the
marbs and had this misshapen creature
not appeared i should have killed pleck
myself before another small-moon had
passed i lune am now king of the
marbs

  nay roared another of the beasts
who stood listening lune is a fool it
is i bike who shall be king of the marbs
if it becomes necessary i shall kill lune
for he shall not stand between me and my
right

  away into the forest and find the
girl commanded himnun the marb
who finds her shall be king of the others
and the council shall stand with him for
six small-moons if he can not maintain
his authority after that why dien he
must fall now go

  the remaining marbs scurried away in
search of ruth and they sought in a way
known only to the animals of lower order

  himnun and professor hervy re-
mained on the scene to await the results

of the quest while kabo kandiked the in-
ert form of nebond back to captivity

  even before kabo returned for them
the ambitious lune returned triumphant
with ruth walking a few paces behind
him and when she saw them she hurried
forward and flung herself sobbing upon
her fathers breast

  oh dad this has been such a hor-
rible experience dad i actually had to
fight them with my hands-and joseph
is so terrible

   it is all right now my dear soothed
her father we have found you and
joseph is in the skilled hands of dr
kabo

   no no dad i fear that he will never
recover oh if you had seen the terrible
things he did you would realize that re-
covery for him is impossible he is a
beast and he doesnt appear to have any
human characteristics left at all dad
what could have happened to have
changed him so

	a discovery

although the martian language
-would have been much easier for
kiser to learn than english for delam
oblene yet she learned english very
quickly because there lurked in her sub-
conscious memory a subdued knowledge
of the language just as a genius is one
who in some previous life has acquired
some proficiency in the line in which he
is now so expert and consequently draws
involuntarily upon this subconscious store
of knowledge and within a short time
the two could converse without difficulty

  the great soul of delam oblene could
function but poorly through the undevel-
oped brain of juak and yet it is the soul
which matters most for juak with the
highly developed brain and beautiful
body of delam oblene was quite as lowly
and base as she had been before she
earthworms of karma



could no more make use of the brain
cells which were now at her disposal than
delam oblene could properly express
herself through the brain and physique of
juak

  both kiser and delam oblene found
it very difficult to concentrate upon any
plan for their own deliverance from this
horrid predicament and in their minds
there evolved plans for their permanent
residence on the satellite and the embry-
onic idea that they might eventually mate
and live quite happily together and yet
there was that infinite something which
forbade them yielding to impulse-per-
haps a degree of self-control developed
by hundreds of years more of experience
than the marbs have had

  delam oblene could remember her ex-
periences as a martian but could not re-
call her previous experiences and was
prone to forget recent occurrences very
quickly while kiser was not so severely
handicapped because he had never been
able to remember his previous incarna-
tions

  one evening while strolling through
the forest kiser noticed a peculiar glow
upon the horizon which reminded him of
the earthly aurora and though he had no
idea how remote the light might be he
elected to make a tour of exploration at
least for a short distance in that direction

  after walking less than a mile he came
upon what he first thought was another
lava lake until he reflected that the lava
lake did not generate light and noted that
this brilliant area gave forth no heat

  it was a bright phosphorescent lake
several acres in area which illuminated
this portion of the forest with almost daz-
zling brilliance and outdid the reflected
light from mars in casting dense black
shadows back into the surrounding dark-
ness

  with a long stick he poked into the

shining mass it was semi-solid and
clung tenaciously to the stick when he
pulled it away the end of the stick
glowed brightly and when he touched it
with his hand it imparted this property
to his fingers

  this was undoubtedly the source of
those luminous balls with which the pho-
bians lighted their cave dwellings what
it was composed of and why it should
exist he could not guess as also he was
at a loss to account for the presence of
the lava lake upon this small satellite
which because of its small size should
have cooled many thousands of years ago
he had marveled also that the atmos-
phere should be so much more dense
here than on mars and that the pull of
gravity was greater upon this satellite
than upon the planet this last he
suspected was due to the centrifugal force
of the rapidly revolving satellite and won-
dered vaguely what might happen to one
who might chance to circumnavigate the
satellite and attempt to walk on the sur-
face which was always turned away from
mars

  when kiser noted that the lake im-
parted its phosphorescent property to the
stick an idea began to formulate in his
slothful brain he wondered if the mar-
tians were not quite proficient in astron-
omy since they were possessed of supe-
rior knowledge in other sciences he
reasoned that they probably excelled in
this also undoubtedly they had seen this
luminous area and might see such lumi-
nous figures or characters as he might
make if drawn large enough

  he hurriedly sought delam oblene to
discuss this plan with her she informed
him that they knew of the phosphorescent
lake also that the satellite had a greater
gravitational pull due to its centrifugal
force and an adequate rainfall but they
had not known of the lava lakes or of any
source of internal heat having taught for


weird tales

centuries that the satellite was damp cold
and forbidding

  when he unfolded his plans to write
an s o s with the phosphorescent sub-
stance she was very enthusiastic and of-
fered her whole-hearted co-operation and
help they set out at once for the lake
and so excited was kiser over the further-
ance of his plan that he set a pace which
delam oblene found difficulty in match-
ing

  we will write both our names in large
characters and when the astronomers see
our inscription through their telescopes
they will deduce that we have been ma-
rooned here and take steps to liberate us
by means of the arrogant imagine
kabos surprize when he learns that his
earthworm has turned upon him and
that his plans have been foiled

  i have tried to reason from every pos-
sible angle and i can not see wherein
there is a chance of failure such an in-
scription as you plan will most assuredly
be seen by our astronomers who will at
once broadcast the news and frambrozo
himnun will do the rest

  when they reached the shore of the
phosphorescent lake kiser secured a
large stick wrapped one end of it secure-
ly with a thick coating of leaves tied
these with grasses and dipped it into the
glowing surface of the lake

  delam oblene followed his example
but when her stick was ready for use she
returned to find kiser floundering in
utter confusion

  its no use he cried in despair its
no use i cant do it

  why what is the matter delam
oblene was perplexed

  i can not remember one single char-
acter of script nebond was never taught
how to write and he might not have been
had they tried for it seems that the marb
brain has no graphic center i can not
write delam oblene i can not write

  his despair was pitiable to behold but
delam oblene did not cry for the same
reason that kiser did not write together
they turned and slunk despondently back
into the forest

  kiser spent a sleepless night nursing
his recent disappointment and wondering
if there might be no way in which they
might seek deliverance from their tragic
fate he had not realized the limitation
resulting from the possession of a marbs
brain and feared lest he might be over-
looking some chance of escape for that
reason would the things about him look
the same if he might look at them with
his own eyes was there not some avenue
of escape which his submerged mentality
was unable to grasp but no what could
be more hopeless than being thus ma-
rooned on a satellite several thousand
miles from the planet mars which was
inaccessible to the inhabitants of the
planet unless they used the earth craft
which was extremely unlikely no they
had not overlooked any possibility be-
cause there was nothing to overlook

  early the next morning he sought de-
lam oblene

  we were greatly disappointed last
night at our failure to signal the planet
and the experience serves to disillusion us
regarding any false hopes of escape from
the fate which kabo has placed upon us
he said perhaps we should make the
best of it and try to be happy why
should we not mate and try to forget our
troubles

  do you think there is no hope that
we might be discovered by your friend
from earth and taken back to masovada
where the council would demand our de-
liverance at kabos hands

  alas no there is no further hope
no one dreams that we may be on this
satellite and unless that were suspected
it would never occur to them to visit pho-
bus but it is not because of the fact that
earthworms of karma



we may never escape our fate that i wish
to mate with you deiam oblene it is
because i have learned to care for you
very very much

  earthman i fear to make so impor-
tant a decision with my present mental
equipment i do not know what to de-
cide i do not know how i should answer
you please give me a few days longer
to think-or try to think perhaps it is
best that we attempt to make the best of
a bad situation perhaps it is best that we
should mate and try to forget as you say
but do not ask me to decide just now
sometimes i think that i do love you
joseph kiser and i would go through
this experience again to aid you but i
do not know how i should answer you
just now perhaps tomorrow i shall tell
you my answer

   joseph kiser readied out a hairy cal-
loused hand and clasped another larger
and even more calloused one and with a
horrid grimace which was intended for a
loving smile he lifted it to his coarse
livid lips just then he thought of ruth
might she not at this moment be think-
ing of him had she allowed another
to replace him in her heart had she
ceased to love him because of these few
months of separation kiser could not
bring himself to believe that she had

	pilluths dilemma

having sought in vain for the two
victims of kabos mania for scien-
tific advancement pilluth was forced to
confer again with kabo

   i have come he said struggling to
control his emotion to make a confes-
sion ask some questions and demand an
adjustment

   your confession and your questions
my dear pilluth i will hear with pleas-
ure replied kabo but you should re-
call that there are but few who may

demand anything of kabo other things
that you should recall are that as a re-
cently commissioned scientist your success
will depend largely upon my co-opera-
tion

  be that as it may you shall hear me
and just this once you shall do as i de-
mand i have seen the creature which
you have imprisoned within your gar-
dens who bears the physical body of
delam oblene i have not been able to
find delam oblene herself nor the marb
form of the earthman but you can do so
-and this you are going to do imme-
diately for i am very impatient to have
them restored in fact the longer their
restoration is delayed the more i am im-
pressed with the conviction that it would
be a virtue to murder you with my two
hands and suffer the consequences

  and just how may i ask are you go-
ing to enforce your demand you have
confessed that you can not find the two
marbs therefore you can not restore them
yourself you dare not report me to the
council for you are as guilty of the
earthlings derangement as i and you
will not murder me as you have threat-
ened for then there would be no one
who could tell you where the two whom
you seek are hidden no pilluth as
always kabo holds the winning cards and
you are quite as helpless as the fools
whom you desire to aid

  there is one trump kabo on which
you failed to reckon there was a men-
acing gleam in pilluths eyes and kabo
paled that is my physical strength i
shall give you just a taste of it now and
repeat it each half-hour in increasing
doses until you are brought to realize that
i mean business when i tell you that these
people must be restored

  pilluth caught a firm hold upon kabos
long slender throat and when his fingers
tightened the martians face first red-
dened and then grew quite purple as his


weird tales

eyes protruded to their extreme limit and
he struggled impotently while pilluth
shook him as though he were a mere in-
fant

  pilluth retained his self-control how-
ever and when the other began to relax
in his efforts at resistance he released his
hold and flung the gasping kabo back
into the chair

  perhaps it may not be necessary to re-
peat that performance said pilluth
evenly when kabo had recovered himself
somewhat but just the same i shall de-
crease the interval to fifteen minutes and
i shall stay here and continue to argue
in this manner until you tell me where
you have hidden your niece and the
earthman and remember if you have
killed diem then there is no further
reason for my refraining from killing
you as i should like very much to do
you fool gasped kabo i shall
ruin you for this no i will not tell you
where they are hidden and you shall rue
the day which gave you the idea that you
might cross kabo and prosper

  kabo pressed a small button upon his
desk and sprang to his feet at once a
door opened behind pilluth and nebond
stepped into the room

  get him nebond screamed kabo
you may run amuck and rend him to
your hearts content beat him kill him
if you like and if you do not you shall
have no more food

  without hesitation nebond sprang
upon the astonished pilluth and struck
him a mighty blow between the eyes and
the martian fell limp and inert to the
floor without even so much as an effort to
defend himself

  after having ascertained that pilluth
still lived kabo called an ambulance and
had him conveyed to the emergency
house then went about his duties just
as though nothing out of the ordinary
had happened he calmly reported the

incident to the councilor chief saying
that the earthman had bolted from his
cell and injured pilluth the earthman
is getting very troublesome he reported
should we not urge his friends to take
him back to earth as soon as possible
he has such strength that our walls will
hardly contain him and sooner or later
he is going to kill someone i shall attend
pilluth personally perhaps i may be able
to save him but i fear that he is fatally
hurt i seriously doubt that he will ever
regain consciousness

  no the councilor chief informed
him we do not want the earthlings to
return nor could they do so if they would
until they construct a pump with which
to replenish their air supply if your
walls are not strong enough we shall con-
struct stronger walls keep him there
and do the best you can to restore his
reason

  you are right the scientist from earth
should not be allowed to return i will
do what may be done for the madman
but i am sure that he is quite incurable
he has lived with some tribe of marbs
until he believes himself one of them
he has even forgotten his own language
and has acquired the monotonous speech
of the marbs i will report pilluths
progress from day to day and if the poor
fellow should pass out i shall attend to
the details of his cremation

	ruth decides

frambrozo himnun had respected
ruths love for kiser and had said
nothing to her of love but they had been
thrown much in each others company
and since the reported death of delam
oblene the martian had found solace
from his bereavement in the companion-
ship of the earth-girl and they had con-
fided in each other unreservedly until a
sort of comradeship had sprung up be-
earthworms of karma



tween them which amounted to an almost
perfect understanding

  and since ruths harrowing experience
in the martian forest she could not think
of kiser without a shudder of aversion
yet amid all of this there persisted the
memory of him as she had known him in
days gone by and she had never ceased
to long for him as he was then it was as
though his soul had been snatched from
him he seemed a man without a soul a
physical remnant of his former self with
even the memory of past events gone
from him speaking a different language
and fancying himself a beast this must
indeed be a strange sort of mania

  professor hervys new-found interest
in the martians maiden sister also added
to ruths loneliness and when at length
himnun began to talk to her of love she
listened willingly why should she not
wed this wonderful martian and try to
live happily upon mars the martian
scientists had told them that the arrogant
would probably not be able to mal the
return voyage and she might never see
others of her own kind and after all
the earth life would seem quite crude in-
deed now since they had had a taste of
the martian existence

  we have both had our disappoint-
ments in life himnun said my own
hope for happiness seemed dead with the
passing of delam oblene but your com-
panionship has revived it i refrained
from speaking until today when the
councilor chief informed me that kabo
has no further hope of joseph kisers re-
covery now i must tell you that i love
you we understand one another and i
know that we can live happily together
our physical differences need not matter
and who knows but that earth blood is
just what is needed to remedy our phys-
ical imperfections

  i hardly know how i should answer
you himnun i am sure that i love you

and i feel certain that we could live hap-
pily together and yet i feel that i should
not desert joseph kiser while there might
be any hope for his recovery and per-
haps if we might only get him back to
earth and away from this low pressure
atmosphere he would recover i feel that
we should try to perfect pumps large
enough to replenish our reservoirs if
you think best we will not divulge the
fact that we have succeeded in reaching
your planet but i feel that we must at-
tempt to get him back and give him this
chance to recover

   but do you have upon earth any such
scientist as unel kabo

  himnun dear i do not know why i
should feel so but i do not trust your
unel kabo he is so repulsive to me and
it seems so strange that poor joseph
should have returned to kabos estate
that day upon which we discovered him
the path of destruction which he had
wrought started from there too and the
poor boy seemed to have intended stop-
ping there until he chanced to remember
that everything about him had been
destroyed do you suppose it is possible
himnun that kabo may have destroyed
his reason

   oh no indeed i am sure that you do
kabo a fearful injustice to even so much
as imagine such a thing why he is our
councilor scientist and highly respected
and honored all over masovada why
should you distrust kabo ruth

  i do not know why but i do he
does not impress me as an honorable man
and i can not endure his sarcastic attitude
and since he maintains that joseph is in-
curable why should he deny us the priv-
ilege of seeing him

  i do not know but i am sure that
there is some good reason perhaps he
fears that it may not be safe only yester-
day the earthman attacked and probably
fatally injured kabos former assistant


weird tales

anhui pilluth i fear that you have
allowed yourself to become unjustly
prejudiced ruth

  perhaps perhaps i should feel shame
to think as i do regarding your coun-
cilor scientist bur what has he done
to entitle him to the respect and confi-
dence of the people of mars

  he has struggled upward from the
rank of a laboratory technician to that of
councilor scientist by hard work and
sheer merit he is the leader of a certain
school of scientific thought which at-
tempts to explain heredity upon the basis
of natural selection and the development
of brain centers while the contending
element maintains that heredity can be
explained by means of natural selection
alone and by natural selection we mean
that a soul upon being incarnated on
masovada chooses or selects the family
which most nearly harmonizes with its
needs-or that the parents subconscious-
ly choose a kindred spirit for their off-
spring to this theory kabo has added the
suggestion that the individual by thous-
ands of years of culture and development
has acquired certain highly specialized
brain centers which are passed on to the
offspring ready for use when the new in-
dividual is properly trained and that this
has a bearing upon heredity kabo has
all but proved his contentions by a series
of surgical operations wherein he has
successfully transferred the mentality of
one animal to the body of another

and-

  but ruth was not listening she had
risen from her seat and her face was
deadly pale

  why what is the matter himnun
sprang to his feet startled

  i see-i see cried ruth almost in-
coherently that is what he has done to
joseph kiser

  why what do you mean asked
himnun bewildered

  dont you see himnun he has-he
has-my god why did we not suspect
the truth before

  you can not mean that-that-why

ruth surely you do not believe-

  i do not believe-i know he has
put the mentality of a beast within the
body of joseph kiser

  but ruth why do you think kabo
has done this thing such things are not
done upon masovada

  but there can be no doubt kabo did
this thing and kept joe imprisoned until
he escaped quite by accident his path
of destruction started within kabos gar-
dens and he returned there with me be-
fore he carried me into the forest he
spoke the martian language and claimed
to be one of the marbs who had been
taken into captivity some months before
and now i remember his having told the
marbs that kabo had captured him al-
though i did not notice it at the time
at first himnun was inclined to doubt
kabos guilt but he was forced to con-
cede that the evidence was overwhelm-
ing and at length he got in communica-
tion with kabo and demanded that the
scientists garden be opened to councilar
inspection

  kabo tried to play for time but him-
nun would take no excuses he demanded
an immediate investigation of kabos
estate and at length kabo came to terms

  himnun he urged i am ready to
confess my guilt in this matter i have
suffered the agonies of the damned be-
cause of having done this thing but once
i had started it i feared to stop just
stop this councilar investigation and i
will restore the earthling as best i can
of course there will be a certain element
of danger connected with the operation
of restoration because of the scar tissue
which will be encounterbut i think i
can restore them god knows i have
been punished sufficiently-i did this
earthworms of karma



thing before i knew that there were oth-
ers in the earthmans party and you may
imagine the suspense i have borne since
the search for him was started i can
not bear the thought of being disgraced
and deported and i will bargain with
you for the restoration of the earthling
if you withhold your knowledge of my
guilt i will restore him but if you report
me to the council he shall remain for-
ever as he is

- restoration

not one word did kabo broadcast
regarding delam oblene but he
must have known that his whole secret
would be found out when kiser was re-
stored and of course the indolent ne-
bond would reveal his duplicity in regard
to pilluths injury so he dared not exe-
cute his original plan regarding his for-
mer assistant and so it was that about
the time when the earthmans recov-
ery was announced pilluth was able
to sit in a wheel-chair for a few minutes
at a time

  the earthmans recovery was another
great triumph for kabo who announced
at the same time that his niece delam
oblene whom he had thought dead for
some months had in reality been afflicted
with the same malady which had crazed
joseph kiser and that with an operation
of his own designing he had restored the
reason of both it was quite a new
malady kabo announced but now he
felt that he had it under perfect control
so that there would be no further spread
-just as many times before he had con-
trolled other maladies which had harassed
the masovadans

  although much further incensed at
kabo for his treatment of delam oblene
himnun was overjoyed at her restoration
from the dead as it were and since
the councilor scientist had made himself

a popular idol of the martians by his
supposed accomplishments he reasoned
that it would not be best to denounce
him for his crimes and chose to remain
silent but not so pilluth

  how long pilluth had been gone from
the emergency house before his absence
was discovered none of the attendants
knew he had not as yet been allowed
to walk and certainly was not able to
leave the institution alone

  the alarm was at once broadcast and
an attempt was made to communicate
with kabo but he could not be reached
many times his vibratory rate was con-
centrated upon but he did not respond
what could be the matter and why
had pilluth disappeared the superin-
tendent was notified and he rushed at
once to the landing-terrace to go in
search of the missing sick man but when
he reached the terrace he uttered an ex-
clamation of surprize for his kandike
was gone

  the institution was in a fever of ex-
citement attendants were questioned
messages were broadcast over the city
the councilor chief was notified and
attempted communication with kabo
having failed an effort was made to
reach pilluth himself-all without result

  the excitement at the emergency
house had reached the degree of its
maximum intensiveness when the super-
intendents kandike was jokingly parked
upon the landing-terrace and pilluth stag-
gered out of it to fall fainting into the
arms of the astonished attendants

  when pilluth had been put to bed and
revived he asked for himnun

  i have done what i considered my
duty said pilluth as himnun seated
himself at the bedside then he related
in detail what had happened since the
landing of the earth-craft and added
knowing that you must have bargained
with kabo i was not content to lie still
weird tales

and allow him to go free with the ap-
plause of all masovada his depravity
demanded severe punishment and i
elected to administer it so i sneaked
away from the emergency house and
performed upon him his own operation
transferring his mentality to the body of
nebond and the mentality of nebond to
the body of kabo just as he did in the
case of joseph kiser

  himnun gasped and sprang to his feet
in his amazement what you mean
to tell me that you did that horrible
thing

  yes and kabo got no more than he
justly deserved or-i should have said
that i attempted to make the interchange
for there was so much scar tissue in ne-
bonds brain and he was so weakened
from his previous recent operation that i
do not believe he can recover that is
-kabo will die kabo in nebonds
physical body will die but with proper
care kabos body and nebonds men-
tality will survive

  my god pilluth why did you do
that is there no way in which your
work may be undone before it is too
late

  there are none who can perform that
operation excepting kabo and myself
i am dying and kabo is probably likewise
dying even should he recover there
will be no one left to restore him unless
he might train someone else and teach
another his technic even as he taught it
to me

   realized that the escapade would
probably be fatal to me but i felt it my
duty to punish kabo as he deserved to be
punished since you were in all prob-
ability bound to secrecy by such promises
as you must have made in order to obtain
the release of delam oblene and die
earthling i also felt it my duty to make
sure that the visiting earthlings should

never return to their own planet i have
punished kabo and i have destroyed the
earth-craft now if death comes i shall
be ready i can face my next incarnation
without remorse without regrets

  you destroyed the earth-craft pil-
luth you are mad why did you do
that

  i felt that i must thus safeguard
masovada against the reign of terror that
might ensue if the strife-loving earth-
lings were to build hundreds of similar
craft and invade the planet with their
greed and avarice and their implements
of war theirs is a competitive system
and to have them among us would de-
stroy our own cooperative methods for
the two are incompatible and the one
must be evolved i considered the earth-
craft a menace to the peace and safety
of masovada true just now they can
not replenish their air supply but it
would be only a short while until they
should bethink themselves of taking the
craft to trandos where the atmospheric
pressure is almost as great as on the
earth kabo confessed to me while par-
tially under the influence of the strotan
ray that he had marooned both his vic-
tims on the satellite and had secretly
purloined the earth-craft and made two
successful voyages to trandos once to
convey them there and once to fetch them
bade for their restoration there the air
supply could be replenished and they
could not long resist the longing to re-
turn to earth and impart the truths of
our superior advancement which the
earthlings are not yet ready to receive-
not by thousands of years i doubt if
the craft may be reproduced on maso-
vada because here we have none of the
helium gas with which they fill certain
of their so-called vacuum tubes not at
any rate for many many years

  pilluths voice became very weak his

lips were becoming quite blue due to dr-
  r	n	wt-
earthworms of karma



culatory failure and even himnun in-
experienced as he was in the branch of
science pertaining to disease knew that
the man was dying he called a nurse
to the bedside and hurried out to render
what assistance might be given to the
hapless kabo and to break the news of
the destruction of the arrogant to the
earthlings

  this news however they received
with far more fortitude than himnun
had expected all had learned to love
the marvelous advantages of the martian
life and their desire to return to the strife
and contention of earth had ebbed quite
low save for the desire to tell the inhab-
itants of the earth about the unique won-
ders of the martian civilization in order
that they might hasten their own evolu-
tionary progress and now that their last
chance to do this was gone they could live
happily on mars with no qualms of con-
science regarding earthly progress

  when himnun saw the glances that
were exchanged between ruth and joseph
kiser he was glad that he had not pushed
his suit for the hand of the earth-girl
more vigorously but more than this was
his heart gladdened by the smile be-
stowed upon him by delam oblene who
was now restored to her rightful body
and her wondrous beauty and so it
was left for professor hervy and mer-
lene to restore the needed physical
prowess to the martians if it were to be
restored in this generation

 in conclusion

the foregoing is an accurate and
fairly detailed account of the adven-
tures of my old friend and schoolmate
joseph kiser as it came to me at various
times over my huge radograph a new
modification of the morse instrument of
my own invention the only existing du-
plicate of which kiser took with him
wt-

upon his memorable expedition some
three years ago

  at times i have doubted its authen-
ticity for it all seems so stupendous and
unreal and the chances for fraudulent
communication must be conceded but
when i stop to consider the character of
joseph kiser a man whose veracity has
always been quite beyond any shadow of
reproach a man whose word has always
been as good as a government bond and
who has never had any patience with
fraud or fraudulent dealings of all kinds
i know that he would nbt intentionally
deceive me i know too that it is he
sending he has proved himself many
times by relating with our specially ar-
ranged code incidents known only to
him and myself

  how well do i recall our last meeting
on the eve of their momentous departure
from earth an event which thrilled the
whole world with the base absurdity of
the thing

  i too had denounced him as a fool
for engaging upon such a venture and
berated him soundly for allowing his
sweetheart to join in so hazardous a jour-
ney but at the last moment i clasped his
hand and tearfully bade him farewell
for to me then it seemed a certainty that
he was going forth to his death

  keep faith with me lon he said in
parting be sure and do not allow your-
self to grow rusty on our code and keep
on trying for at least five years wher-
ever we land if we do land ill manage
somehow to provide for power enough
to reach you just keep listening lon
promise me youll keep on listening

and i promised although it grieves
me now to recall how near i came to
breaking that promise for i had not the
least hope then of ever having the oppor-
tunity of answering his signals in faa
i never approached my instrument with


weird tales

the thought of kiser in mind that i did
not feel quite silly because of the subcon-
scious hope that he might be calling me

  it was more than two years after the
departure of the arrogant when i caught
the first signal from joseph kiser at
first it did not register upon my con-
sciousness and was only an unintelligible
series of ticks some amateur perhaps for
my radograph will receive from any
morse instrument i listened intently
trying to interpret the message then
suddenly i was alert it was kisers call
in our code

  i seized the key and sent him my an-
swer he spent several whole minutes
sending nothing but emphatic ejacula-
tions of joy he had established com-
munication with the earth and his joy
seemed unbounded then he spent sev-
eral hours unfolding to me the foregoing
story the reception was very poor at
times and he had even greater difficulty
in receiving from me consequently there
are many things which he tried to tell me
which i have been forced to omit from
this narrative because i could not get it
clearly enough to comprehend and

  strange to say since that day i have never
been able to communicate with him at all
although i have tried diligently night
and day for many weeks and months the
line of communication between earth
and the planet mars appears to have been
permanently broken

  what has happened in this connection
i do not have the faintest idea perhaps
my friend has been killed perhaps the
martian authorities did not want to have
the earthmen know of the success of the
arrogants flight lest others attempt it
and likewise succeed perhaps the batter-
ies with which kiser operated the rado-
graph have worn out and they are unable
to replace them upon mars or yet per-
haps i may hear more from him later
who knows

  i	know that there are many things
which joseph kiser would like to tell me
and which he will yet tell me if the op-
portunity offers and so i am hoping lis-
tening signaling praying for more news
from mars more of the culture and
knowledge that we may the sooner evolve
to a higher state of being than that of
earthworms of karma

the flame fiend

           by n j oneail

r ihanks archer ill be glad to
join you but with just one stipula-
tion-and it must seem an insane
one that you dont light a fire in that
huge fireplace of yours

  no im not joking call it an absurd
whim if you choose though god knows
its not that either i was never more seri-
ous in my life i know its a cool evening
with a wind blowing that bites like sin
itself but id rather face a lifetime in the
eternal ice at the pole than - well no
matter about that

  it isnt that ive any eskimo complex
i crave warmth and shrink from cold
more than the average man but-well
as i said theres no use trying to explain
it i could of course but you wouldnt
believe me youd be a fool if you did

  set it down to pyrophobia if you like
an obsession well yes perhaps but
you neednt look at me like that theres
nothing psychopathic about it my minds
as sound as it ever was and as normal
and thats a wonder perhaps after-oh
damn it archer on second thought id
better not go id only have you studying
me all evening as if i were an object les-
son in idiosyncrasies just forget that i
ever mentioned any such thing

  no its no use trying to explain i
never have yet id sooner be classed as
just plain eccentric than as a combination
of liar lunatic and hophead no you
might not old man but i couldnt ask
even you to believe-well damn it why
not after all now that youve got my
thoughts running through that channel of

hell again it might ease my mind-as i
said you wont believe me but at least
you wont laugh at me

   besides it should be of particular inter-
est to you since it has a bearing on poor
old sharpies and his fate you remem-
ber him of course with his deep-sunken
brooding eyes gleaming above his big
beak of a- nose and his graying reddish
hair straggling awry from under that rum
old skull-cap why of course we were
in his class in applied psychology togeth-
er cant you still see him there on the
platform dinning into our adolescent ears
the supremacy of mind over matter

  he dabbled of course in all kinds of
occult research dabbled isnt the word
either for it was the absorbing passion of
his life i dont suppose there have been
a dozen men in the last century who had
delved so deeply into black letter lore it
was rumors about some of his experi-
ments you remember that finally led to
his being cropped from the faculty

  he confided to me once that one of
his favorite theories was that of material-
ization i dont mean any spiritualist
seance hokum with ectoplasm and table-
tapping and spirit messages but the pow-
er of the human mind by thought-ooncen-
tration to summon up in tangible physi-
cal form objects from other worlds wher-
ever and whatever those other worlds may
be

  none of us of course took much stock
in his hobbies at that time i wish to god
i had for that might have saved me-
but im rather running ahead of myself

                                        


weird tales

  after the old chap left the university
you remember he buried himself in an
old hunting-lodge up in the rockies and
there kept on with his researches he
wrote me once about two years ago a let-
ter as curt and enigmatic as most of his
lectures but hinting that he was on the
verge of triumph in some weird experi-
ment and inviting me to visit him when-
ever i could find the time

  it was just a couple of weeks later that
we read of the poor old beggars uncanny
death you of course were abroad at the
time and may not have heard many of the
details a couple of hunters found his
body stretched on die floor of his cabin
his head and throat incredibly mangled
it might have been the work of a puma or
some other giant cat so far as appearances
went but it couldnt have been for the
door and every window of the lodge were
locked

  in fact there was no end of mystery
and to-do about it for weeks the thing
was so inexplicable that the hunters who
had found him were under suspicion for
a time but their records were clean and
there was no possible motive for murder
so they were released and the case lapsed
into the long list of unsolved enigmas

  three months or so later a business trip
took me to the coast and set me thinking
once more of sharpies i had always had
a deep admiration for the old chap and i
believe that in his gruff way he was fond
of me too it hurt me to think that i had-
nt had a chance of accepting his invita-
tion to visit him and then the fancy
seized me to pay a sort of posthumous
call at any rate to visit the spot where he
had met his end

  it lay on a god-forsaken slope in the
rockies twenty miles from the nearest
settlement and i spent the better part of a
day scrambling up the rocky incline and
cutting my way through festering under-

growth that twined snake-like round my
legs

it was just growing dusk when i finally
reached the lodge a solitary log struc-
ture bathed in a blood-red glow from the
setting sun as i approached it a single
dying pine tree stood like a mournful sen-
tinel beside the building for the rest the
landscape was a boulder-strewn waste
with an occasional clump of bushes in the
distance

  the place would have been gloomy
enough even at midday and i give you
my word that in the gathering shadows i
felt a distinct physical chill as i opened
the door of the lodge

  the building consisted of three rooms
a large rectangular living-room with a
tiny bedroom and a kitchen opening off it
on the left a huge stone fireplace fully
twelve feet wide and towering to the ceil-
ing was built into the right-hand wall

  the furniture of the simplest had been
left apparently just as it was during
sharpies lifetime there was a large
plain wooden table piled high with dog-
eared volumes almost any one of which
would have been evidence enough to send
the old man to the stake a few centuries
ago an armchair a few other chairs and a
battered trunk and every item in the col-
lection semed to be enveloped in an al-
most tangible aura of sinister isolation

  the other rooms were furnished in just
as spartan style a tousled cot a single
chair and a shelf piled high with more
books were all that were to be seen in the
bedroom in the kitchen a few granite
dishes cooking-utensils and a small shelf
piled with canned foods

  by now night had fallen in earnest and
i found the cabin growing momentarily
chillier both physically and mentally and
it didnt make matters any the more cheer-
ful when playing my electric torch over
the flame fiend



the floor i perceived several dark blotches
in front of the fireplace reminders of the
unexplained tragedy those walls had wit-
nessed

  i had brought food with me prepared
for an overnight stay in the cabin but at
that moment the prospect was far from
appealing to me however i wasnt anx-
ious to tackle that twenty-mile trek back
to the village by dark and then a sudden
savage patter of rain on the roof helped
me make up my mind the cabin would
be my shelter until dawn at least

  i found a pile of pine knots beside the
cabin and with an armful of these soon
had a fire blazing which helped to dispel
the gloom as i munched my solitary
meal the rain kept up its tattoo on the
roof and several vicious lightning flashes
tore a passage through the air just outside
the window but i preferred even the
storms accompaniment to the tomb-like
stillness that had preceded it

  after supper with the aid of a kero-
sene lamp that i discovered in the kitchen
i started on a more thorough inspection of
the place and my heart was touched at the
evidences of the hermit-like life poor old
sharpies must have led to say nothing of
the unexplained gruesomeness of his
death

  i could hardly hope to find anything
that would shed any light on that of
course since the cabin had been thorough-
ly searched at the time so i turned to an
examination of the old mans books

  i doubt if anywhere else on this conti-
nent you could have found such a library
of occult lore of sorcery and necromancy
from the days of earliest egypt down to
twentieth century psychic research as
the tempests fury swelled outside i
turned the pages of one cabalistic volume
after another they werent the sort of
thing to be fathomed at a glance but the
little that i gathered from them opened

up vistas of things unseen and unthink-
able that appalled me

  i tell you archer there are not only
more things in heaven and earth than are
dreamed of in your philosophy but there
are far more in hell too for in those
printed pages i saw things hinted at that
could only emanate from the deepest hell
of hells and as for what followed-

  finally between the pages of one in-
credible tome a translation from the an-
cient egyptian i fell upon something of
a far deeper personal interest-a pad of
scribbling-paper covered with a familiar
scrawl-the handwriting of old sharpies
himself as cryptic a hieroglyph as any
ever inscribed on the oldest pyramids

  it appeared to be a diary in which he
had recorded his progress with experi-
ments of some sort but so laconically
that i could gather little from them the
last entry was dated-as nearly as i could
recall-four or five days before the find-
ing of his body

  threshold of triumph at last it read
tonight - final proof    danger if
control falters    formula of sothmi
should suffice

  then i glanced at the book in which i
had found the notes from the page at
which it was open i read

  notable among such elementals is the sala-
mander the spirit of fire this being sothmi
describes as having the aspect of a giant lizard
with protruding fangs and claws   

  at that moment the light of the kero-
sene lamp flickered and vanished leaving
the room illuminated only by the dancing
rays of the fire i saw that the lamp was
empty so i heaped another armful of pine
knots on the blaze and drew the armchair
up closer to it

i had brought the book with me but as
a particularly vivid flash of lightning
stabbed the darkness outside and a clap


weird tales

of thunder snarled in its wake i hesitated
to read on my mind and feet seemed to
be treading a dangerous labyrinth whose
tortuous windings might lead at least to
madness if not to some abyss of hell

  as the fire crackled and the flames
leaped hungrily ever higher toward the
ceiling i gazed into their glowing depths
strange i thought that my mind should
so focus on the fire when a moment before
i had been reading of the mythical spirit
of fire but after all was it so strange

  that uncanny snatch of description was
running through my mind-the aspect
of a giant lizard with protruding fangs
and claws-and i tried blind fool that i
was to conjure up a mental image of such
a being

   of course i told myself it was prepos-
terous to sit in the twentieth century of
christian civilization and dream of a crea-
ture of five-thousand-year-old fable and
yet those words obtruded still on every
cell of my brain-the aspect of a giant
lizard with protruding fangs and claws

   by now i was staring into the fire with
the fixed fascination of a crystal-gazer
theres a hypnotic force about a blazing
flame archer small wonder i reflected
that primitive races had either deified it
or at least imbued it with a personal spirit
-the salamander

  as i gazed into the fire an illusion
gradually grew upon me that my brain
was whirling round and round in a circle
at the center of which crouched the figure
the book had described-a giant lizard
with protruding fangs and claws   

   i grant you archer that that was pure
illusion auto-hypnosis if you will but
what followed wasnt

  for suddenly above the roar of the
storm outside and the crackling of the fire
-which had now grown so hot that i
had moved my chair back from it - i
heard a sound which turned me cold with

dread as no sound has ever done before
or since

   it was a peculiar sibilant hiss which
came to my ears as clearly as though all
else had been dead silence it wasnt un-
like the hiss of an angry cobra if youve
ever heard that none-too-pleasant sound
but it possessed too some incredible un-
earthly quality which set my head reeling
with involuntary nausea

  and above all it appeared to come
from the very center of the fire

  for a moment i looked backward to-
ward the door and pondered the possi-
bility of breaking away and spending the
night even in the open in that downpour
of rain if necessary but then i got a
tighter grip on my nerves and trying to
convince myself against my own knowl-
edge that it was all imagination i turned
to face the fire once more

  as i did so that diabolical hiss came
once more followed by a peculiar stertor-
ous grunting and then in the very heart
of the flame i beheld something gradual-
ly assuming visible form

   first it appeared to be a mist or vapor
and then out of the mist two dreadful
green spots glowed like searchlights play-
ing from the very bowels of hell and
then the mist seemed to settle into a solid
outline-such an outline that i screamed
aloud in horror of soul and sprang from
my chair and would have burst out into
the night but in a twinkling the ungodly
thing had leaped straight from the heart
of the flame and gripped me by the throat

   archer this is the living truth i swear
it as i am a living man this moment i
havent words - human tongue hasnp
power-to describe adequately that foul
spawn of satan that had materialized
from thin air before my very eyes

  the description i had just read-a
giant lizard with protruding fangs and
claws-fitted it as far as it went but it
the flame fiend



didnt begin to picture the soul-sickening
repulsiveness of the object

   it wasnt unlike a gila monster in gen-
eral appearance if you can conceive of a
gila monster five feet in length with a
slimy black body and ghastly horned head
eyes that glowed alternately red and
green fang-like teeth projecting from a
satanically slavering mouth and forelegs
with claws like those of an eagle

  and this unutterable horror was the
thing that had torn the life from poor
old sharpies body i realized that in the
same twinkling of an eye that it had cata-
pulted itself upon me

   i was so unnerved in soul and body that
a breath of wind could almost have
floored me and i collapsed like a rag be-
neath the spring of the monster then as
i found myself flat on die floor with its
ruthless talons sinking into my throat and
its foul face pressed close to mine its
breath searing me like a blast from hell
despair gave me new strength

  i dont know whether old sharpies was
there in spirit aiding me in my battle
against that atrocity from the shades or
not but i dug both hands into the crea-
tures throat and twined its legs about its
flopping body with the grip of a boa con-
strictor

  even in that hectic accumulation of
horror upon horror i experienced a fresh
twinge of nausea to find that although the
thing had emerged from the heart of the
flame its body was as icy cold as though
fresh from a tomb

  old dante himself archer could
scarcely have painted in one-tenth of its
ghastliness a word-picture of the struggle
there in that lonely cabin with thunder
lightning and rain outside lending a fit-
ting accompaniment

   it seemed like hours--in reality it cant
have been five minutes for no human be-
ing could have lived so long in such un-
equal combat-that i tossed and grappled

with that awful thing i felt in my heart
of hearts that the struggle was vain that
i couldnt hope to kill or even to over-
come this thing which wasnt of earth
but still with the frenzy of despair i
tore at its neck and kicked at its pulpy
body as those savage talons bit into my
shoulders and that unspeakable mouth
with its protruding fangs hovered close
above mine

  and then the bestial jaws opened wid-
er and i knew the end was at hand and
i prayed to god as ive never prayed be-
fore that it might come with merciful
quickness

  and it did there was a sudden blind-
ing flash and then a crumbling rattling
roaring sound as though the universe it-
self were falling in ruins something
crashed on my head and then-oblivion

you probably dont believe in mir-
acles archer but i do ever since that
night im firmly convinced that it is due
to divine intervention that im alive today

  when the mists lifted from my brain
i lay in a pile of stone wreckage on the
floor of the cabin racked with agony in
every limb my first conscious thought
was of that fiend from the shades then
as i raised my head slowly to look for it
i realized that it had vanished and that
the blessed light of day was streaming in
the windows

  no no archer it wasnt a dream
here-just a minute until i loosen my
collar youll notice that i wear it particu-
larly high do you see those scars on my
throat no dream could have put them
there if those unholy claws had gone a
quarter of an inch farther theyd have
tom my jugular vein open

  well explanations are always an anti-
climax so ill cut mine as short as pos-
sible combining what i observed there
and what i learned later from a closer
study of sharpies books


weird tales

  the thing that had killed sharpies and
come within an ace of doing the same to
me archer-you wont believe it i know

-	was literally a salamander one of
chose elemental beings which form a con-
necting link between this world and some
world beyond

  an elemental of course is a disem-
bodied thing only capable of action if it
can get control of a physical body as an
instrument and old sharpies had created
such an instrument for this creature

  those diabolical old volumes of his
contained among many secrets the ritual
to be followed in the summoning of an
elemental in material form the theory
was that by sheer concentration of will-
power an adept or sorcerer-call him
what you will-could create a material
body or shell for such a spirit

  in the case of the salamander there
were two essentials first the concentra-
tion of the mind and secondly a strong
hot fire-the native element of the crea-
ture and old sharpies had succeeded as
he had dreamed of doing in actually in-
carnating the monster which had cost him
his life

  the materialization was a limited one
is all such materializations are thank
god limited as to place and time the
alamander was fettered you might say
to that spot it could move only a few
feet from the flames in which it had
sprung into being and it dematerialized
once more the moment the flames died

  but once summoned into actual exist-
ence probably for the first time in a score
of centuries the thing was still chained
anseen at that spot and hence far less
concentration of thought was necessary

o	summon it a second time the fire
md the involuntary focusing of my mind
on what i had read were sufficient

  then came the miracle that saved me

at the moment when it seemed that scarce-
ly even a miracle could intervene

  in that instant when that hell-born
creatures fangs were at the point of meet-
ing in my throat a lightning bolt had
struck the stone chimney of the cabin
and had sent it crashing inward shatter-
ing the fireplace and instantly extinguish-
ing the flames-with the consequence
that the salamanders material body had
evaporated into the air from which it had
emanated

  thats my story archer and-well
just a point or two more perhaps

  as i say i realized later that that
damnable tiling was still lurking invisi-
ble within the cabin thirsting with all its
unholy force for another opportunity of
taking physical form

  there wasnt much likelihood of that
perhaps since the fireplace was irretriev-
ably shattered and even if any wayfarer
in that desolate region had chanced to
build a fire there thered be practically no
chance of his turning his thoughts in a
dangerous direction

  but i was resolved to take no chances
on its ever being loosed on human eyes
again so i did probably a high-handed
and unlawful thing a week later i
climbed that tortuous mountain slope
again and laid a charge of dynamite be-
neath the cabin which leveled it in a tan-
gle of wreckage to the ground

  sharpies books i removed first poured
kerosene over them and set them alight
-with a long fuse incidentally for i
preferred to be a couple of miles from
the spot when those sinister pages flared
into flame

  theres nothing more to add except
that from that day to this ive never dared
to face flame for fear my mind in sheer
defiance of my sanity may focus there
once more and summon up some other
lurking messenger from hell

now prized because living in new york
and the reply had been both gay and
friendly

  by all means come new york will
do you good moping never helped any-
body alive or dead

  her parents had consented surprized
relieved

  but between the date which she had
given her family and that which she had
given her light-hearted friend there was a
discrepancy she had cheated from the
pattern two days for herself in new york
-days of rendezvous

  for she had not been able to accept
death submissively the family clergy-
man had come wise and kind she had
thanked him no tears no unburdening

  she had found that she had no faith
she had found that faith would not do
she must know

  she had haunted public libraries had
bought many books she read all she could
find for and against a future life oh yes
both sides ray lankester clodd other
agnostics the stiffer-brained psychic re-
searchers the vast literature of slop about
survival she discarded as an insult cold
academic things like balfours ear of
dionysius brought comfort it seemed that
she could hope and yet be rational

  then she had taken her resolve she
would communicate with peter it had be-
come an obsession to hear from him that
he lived that he forgave

  in new york she would ask the insti-
tute of psychic science for a medium
known to them as honest she would be
rational she would not fool herself she
would ask peter to give her something
evidential then proof of peters identity
having been given she would beg him to
forgive would tell him how desperately
she now loved him

five weeks today she had just finished
that difficult letter to peter if she

posted it at once he would have it before
he left new york to come to her for the
week-end as she put on her hat and coat
she had been called to the telephone

  a telegram that peter was dead killed
in a street accident saving a strange child
from an oncoming motorbus

  telling no one of the message she had
returned to her room had locked the door
and had burned her letter to peter

  then she had sat down and had stared
at the opposite wall her brain had be-
come a gramophone record it rasped out
words of the telephone message scraps of
the letter just destroyed

    regret to inform you that peter
edgington-dear peter for some time i
have been fighting-killed in a street acci-
dent-fighting the realization that you and
i-saving a child   

  it became incredible that an hour ago
she had decided peter too uninteresting to
spend her life with had decided that even
as a lover he had a little too much manner
was a little theatrical

  she remembered only their swift ro-
mance his impulsive ardor and having
tired of him living she had fallen the
more desperately in love with him dead

  of the burned letter the disloyalty she
told no one remorse edged her grief
she-false to her word false to the beauty
radiant if nebulous of their dramatic
courtship-she had presumed to think him
dull his letters might not have been-
well brilliant-but he had been loyal he
had been fine in death he had been heroic

  her mind knew only the beauty of their
love the tragedy of his death and a pas-
sionate remorse

arrived that morning in new york

-	she had gone at once to the institute
of psychic science

  yes they could recommend a medium
absolutely trustworthy and with a record
of excellent results
gesture



   could she have a sitting today if suc-
cessful another tomorrow she was only
in new york for a brief time

  the secretary a brisk intelligent
woman had offered to telephone mrs
parmenter she did so

  yes that afternoon at five oclock
what name

  and her name had sounded in her own
ears like that of a stranger for these two
days were to be quite outside the pattern of
her life beyond the strange human labels
people bore

   besides what did it matter the secre-
tary was used to such requests no one
else was in the room excepting a man who
had entered and who was engrossed in
some pamphlets spread out on a table

  the secretary then wrote mrs par-
menters address on a slip of paper

   would it be all right if i were to take
notes i might want to consult them
later

   by all means mrs parmenter prefers
her clients to take notes

   as she put the slip of paper in her hand-
bag and turned to go she saw the secretary
smile familiarly to the next customer

   so glad the sittings are being success-
ful i have that list of books ready for
you and i am arranging for a third me-
dium for you to try

   it was all as crisp and business-like as
the selling of groceries

and the seance had been-a ghastly
i failure

  mrs parmenter a plump woman in a
negligee had greeted her with kind im-
personality and had told her to sit quietly

  mrs parmenter had closed her eyes
and after a few minutes had begun to
breathe in an odd heavy manner then to
mumble at last words had come

  confusion-oh so much confusion
conditions are bad-very bad several
people want to speak to you an old

gentleman-has a gray mustache-says
he is your grandfather - very sorry for
you

   it was all in the notes all futile and
pointless a grandfather was a safe guess
mrs parmenter was doubtless honest but
mrs parmenters subconscious no sane
person could trust

   there had followed generalities appli-
cable to any grandfather true they did
apply to her own grandfather but not
necessarily exclusively to him

   you are in trouble-oh yes in deep
trouble

   so were most clients of mediums

  then that saccharine message your
grandfather says that you are not to be so
unhappy that happiness is close to you

   kind that of mrs parmenters sub-
conscious

   next had come a jumble of incoheren-
cies irrelevant things that were disturb-
ingly reminiscent of ignominious fortune-
telling and yet-a strange eery feeling
was creeping over her a feeling as if some
third presence were in the room

  a dark man-peter had had bright
red hair-i get something about dancing
-dance music-and a mask

   she tried to be scientific she knew that
genuine messages had to filter through the
subconscious mind of the medium that
they were often interlarded between hap-
hazard tags of the conscious mind mrs
parmenter was getting muddled up with
halloween festivities

   suddenly mrs parmenter stiffened 
cant get through-confusion but  get
help for you i see a black mask- most
masks were black-and yes a dark
man oh those dark men of the palm-
ists

   and despite her skepticism a shudder
as if a chill from another world passed
over her at the words-a black mask

   im sorry mrs parmenter i know you
are trying the sitter must show a sympa-


weird tales

thetic attitude wont you please try a
little longer

  she realized that the seance was about
to close-a failure she threw overboard
hopes of evidential proofs

  mrs parmenter i want very much
very much to communicate with a red-
haired man who died recently

  and this she said not for her own sake
but on the remote chance of it reaching
peter no comfort for her in helping out
mrs parmenter but if mrs parmenter
had power if this were merely one of
those inexplicable bad sittings which even
great mediums at times had it might reach
peter

  only this mrs parmenter ask him to
forgive me

  oh it had been too distressing poor
mrs parmenters subconscious or control
or whatever it was that was bungling so
ludicrously caught at that word for-
give

  yes-yes-he is here-he is here-
oh very distressed-forgive-forgive-
hes saying that dear-begs you to forgive
him-to forgive him-why thats what
you said yourself-says forgive and forget
him   

  she had risen thank you mrs par-
menter that-will do

she stood looking at his photograph
she was very tired for weeks she had
eaten hardly anything for weeks she had
slept badly for weeks her awakenings
had been recurring shocks that nightmare
return of consciousness return of memory

  she turned again to the notes of the se-
ance they were already flabby from much
handling was there something she had
missed some chink through which a
glimmer had shone for her

  as she turned the pages a knock sound-
ed on her door she started then she
opened the music came more loudly to
her

  oh where have you been all my life

  a bellboy handed her a small packet it
was addressed to her but ho one knew she
was here

  the boy gone she tore off the wrap-
pings

  a black velvet mask nothing more

  some mistake but her name on the
paper she examined it as if it were a
cipher she could find nothing unusual
unless a small flaw in the edge that would
rest on the left cheek were of importance
a small flaw as if someone had snipped
out a v

  she dropped it on the bed

  again she heard mrs parmenters en-
tranced voice-a mask-a black mask

  but she had read of nothing like this
true the other world was reported often
to signal through normal channels but a
bellboy a scrap of velvet-it was too mun-
dane for her to accept

  but from where then did it come

  oh was it all a monstrous delusion
were the results of even the sanest investi-
gators the mere amassing of data on some
as yet not-understood vagaries of the sub-
conscious mind

  she looked at the black mask was this
her sign and if so what its significance

  still dance music drifted up to her
room

  oh where have you been all my life

   it must be that she was to join the revel-
lers there to receive some message meet
some envoy

  opening her trunk she feverishly
pulled out an evening gown as she flung
off the negligee she had been wearing
part of her brain smiled derisively people
had warned her that dabbling in spirit-
ualism ended in lunacy

  at this moment she might be insane
that mask black on the white bed might
be a figment of her disordered brain she
had read those notes too often no bell-
gesture



boy perhaps had called at her door well
of course if she were to reason that way
anything might je nothing- she might not
even be in new york

   she picked up the mask

   was she going to meet peter or a mes-
sage from him she rouged her lips was
this the fantasy of hysteria was there no
future was peter dead by all means then
let her gaud herself to meet such a mock-
ery

from the elevator she alighted on the
mezzanine floor she would wait it
was less crowded here than on the ground
floor her mask made her indifferent to
stray glances

   and to her they were a drifting picture
-these hackneyed carnival marionettes

   a black-and-white pierrot was looking
at her he was alone he approached he
was at her side he bent to her

  thank you for coming his voice
was deferential

   she looked up into a black velvet mask
his gaze seemed on the missing v in her
own mask

  from whom do you come she said
slowly

   from no one none the less i have a
message but-not yet it is a question of
-forgiveness

   she could not answer

  messages do come through human
channels you know that

   yes i know that i have tried

   i can not speak clearly while you are so
tired-so weak

   her notes beat through her mind dance
music-a black mask-a dark man the
skull-cap of pierrot hid his hair the mask
his face

   will you take off your cap

  my cap surprizedly without dis-
lodging his mask he carefully removed
the cap

   dark hair

  thank you why must i not see your
face she asked in the accentless tones she
had used through their interview

  you do not want the message from a
concrete personality let me remain a
mask unless he hesitated knowing
all i bring you you still wish otherwise
i am tired say what you have to say
and let me return to my room

  his voice was kind i dont want you
to do that you go back to unhappiness i
am very sure he does not want you to do
that

  how long am i to sit here-waiting
i can not go on talking it leads nowhere
he drew up a chair for a moment
neither spoke a moment she could not
say a moment or ten minutes she had
no way of telling

  may i tell you what i think he wants
you to do

  tell me

   he wants you for a little while to for-
get everything he wants you to come with
me and to have supper he wants you to
forget everything his voice had a soft
even quality as if he were trying to hypno-
tize her he wants you to dance to
dance on halloween night knowing that
the dead are not unhappy

  she was past astonishment she made
no protest at his incongruous words he
seemed speaking to her from a distance
she looked wearily at him

  you are a man and young scores of
pretty girls are about you some not too
severe i will remain here return when
you feel you can give me what it is you
have for me

  wont you let me give you this one
evening i am very sorry for you

  pity from a stranger but she was too
weak for resentment

   suddenly he asked in practical tones al-
most the tones of a physician exactly
how much have you eaten today

  eaten she looked up and then she


weird tales

knew it was all unreal those rose-velvet
chair-things those rugs from somewhere
men called china those carnival shad-
ows-they were but veils drifting across
her perception

  again his quiet level tones exactly
how much have you eaten today

  doctors they called people who
talked that way

  so you are a doaor

  never mind that tell me

  since such a trifle mattered to him she
told him he rose abruptly

  come

  im not hungry not interested in
food

  she seemed quite outside her body but
she heard a dull voice and knew it to be
the voice she used

  and he was no longer envoy of the be-
yond he was a very physical identity by
his will leading her into the elevator   
down  to a garish supper room

   it took less effort to do what he bid her
those soothing even repetitions of his
some chicken thing some tingling drink
which he helped to prepare it burned
through her it lit up her physical brain
a bescrawled palimpsest-indelible phrases
-there shall no beat strike them neither
shall the sun    behold i make all
things new    eat drink and be
merry   

  she was again in her body leaning over
an emptied plate and emptied glass gaz-
ing into dark eyes behind a black mask
and on the table lay the mask which she
had been wearing

  her hand went to her face in quick dis-
may

  he was talking to her she reached out
to his voice the words didnt matter

  no w i can tell you my message i know
your name i know that you were pledged
to marry peter edgington

  her hands clutched the edges of the
table

  i have something that peter edgington
wants me to tell you he asks you to for-
give him his voice became concise as
if he knew the scalpel must be used
clearly he was a doaor what i have to
tell will hurt peter died a hero but in life
he was very human he was to have gone
to you the week-end after his death to ask
your forgiveness and release he had
fallen in love with another woman

  at last she spoke

  the dead are not here to defend them-
selves i must have some proof

  he removed his mask honest eyes an
honest face

  it was he reddened my own sister
whom peter edgington wanted to marry
when he died

  a weight was slipping from her life
long entranced stirred again

  you will not judge my sister she
thought peter was free until-there
seemed to them no going back

  i judge she told him of the unposted
letter the remorse the return of love

  he told my sister your name but not
where you lived after his death my sis-
ter confided in me my sister distraaed
determined to communicate with peter
edgingtons spirit i begged that at least
she avoid the harpies that cheat people
who long to be cheated i went for her to
the institute of psychical science she
found comfort she had a series of sittings
then she wished to try other mediums
something about obtaining cross-refer-
ences she began to study psychical re-
search it seemed to be calming her so i
have gone often to the institute to make
necessary arrangements for her this
morning i was there turning over some
pamphlets when i heard your name the
hour and address of your appointment
with mrs parmenter i saw you i knew
the invisible bond



the truth would hurt but also that it was
due to you

  poor peter

  i kept your appointment this after-
noon i followed you back to this hotel
so as to know where to reach you you
went to your room i noticed the prepara-
tions for tonights masquerade then-i
thought of sending you the mask

  but you could not know i would wear
it coincidence alone brought that about
the mediums subconscious was muddled
up with halloween and so she spoke of

a mask a black mask-

  a strange look crossed his face

  of course i dont believe in this at
all-all this occult stuff as a medical
man i know and use hypnotism the
rest i mistrust but-its most extraor-
dinary i would never have thought of
sending you that mask it isnt sensible

its theatrical id have written asking
the privilege of a brief interview but
as i stood in the lobby this afternoon
the idea dropped into my brain from
outside i seemed to hear a black mask
it became an urge i had the incredible
feeling that peter edgington wished me
to tell you that way

  he looked ashamed at talking so
frayedly and hastened to add sanely of
course i knew that tomorrow i could still
ask for my interview if you did not come
tonight

  she gazed at him -with clear steady
eyes

  will you dance he asked shyly

  she rose and as she smiled she
knew why it was that peter would have
none of the privilege of a brief inter-
view idea also dear peter had always
loved a gesture

the invisible bond

          continued from page 

came presently we caught the faint glint
of firelight through the trees

  hurry cried leslie in a voice i
scarcely recognized we are on the way
to elna hurry

  rightly or wrongly he was convinced
that the drums were leading him to his
lost bride he seemed to throw all cau-
tion to the winds as he crashed his way
through the tangled scrub heedless of
everything except the red glimmer ahead
had i not forcibly restrained him i ver-
ily believe he would have dashed for-
ward and attacked single-handed the
horde of savages that were seated round
the fire i had to drag him under cover
by main force

  are you mad i whispered when i
had got him behind the shelter of a clump

of bushes they are fifty to one you
will not help elna by throwing away your
life

  the spot where we were crouching
was about twenty yards from the fire
which burnt brightly in the center of the
small clearing by the light of the leap-
ing flames we were able to pick out the
huge form of the witch-doctor as he sat
a little apart from the rest on a throne-
like seat of carved wood by his side
upon the ground there crouched a
slighter figure muffled from head to foot
in a cloak of leopard skins about ten
feet away was leon the missing steward
lying bound hand and foot

  some sort of ritual was in progress
ever and again nzahgi would lift up
his voice and intone a string of words


weird tales

and the rest would chant a response in
thunderous unison keeping time to the
booming of the drums although neither
leslie nor i understood the language we
guessed from the growing excitement
that the climax of the ceremony was near
at hand

  nor were we mistaken the weird lit-
any culminated in a sudden mighty shout
then there followed a tense expectant
silence and every eye was turned toward
the muffled figure which crouched beside
the throne for a space during which
one might count a hundred slowly the
seated savages remained as still and mo-
tionless as effigies of gleaming bronze
then the drums began to beat a faster
rhythm and the crouching figure leapt
to its feet and cast aside the leopardskin
cloak standing poised like some beautiful
ivory statue in the firelights glare

  a convulsive gasp came from the boy
at my side

  elna his voice was so loud that
but for the drums it would have led to
our discovery my god-its elna

  but it was elna in a new and dreadful
guise when i had seen her lst she had
been dressed like an ordinary english
girl now every vestige of civilization had
been cast aside had it not been for the
dazzling whiteness of her skin and the
glory of her hair bright as sun-kissed
corn she might have passed for one of
the women of the tribe

  my first emotion was a sense of dull
incredulity quld this shameless jungle
amazon be elna-the girl whom i had
watched over and reared whom i had
taught to ride straight shoot straight
and live straight impossible-the thing
was absurd that painted and feather-
decked savage was not my little girl-
rather was it some foul flaunting demon
who had gained possession of her white
and flawless body-some poisonous spirit
that had entered into her blood   

  her blood the truth rushed upon me
like an overwhelming torrent as the
thought crossed my mind it was not her
blood that now flowed in her veins-it
was the blood of the naked savage who
towered behind her with the light of tri-
umph gleaming in his eyes nzahgi had
given his blood that she might live and
now he was about to lay claim to his own

  suddenly leslie caught my shoulder
and twisted me around so that i faced
him heavens the boy was smiling had
he gone mad

  dont you understand he whispered
in a tone of immeasurable relief elna
is acting a part she is dancing to fix
their attention-to gain time she knows
that help is at hand and shes just fool-
ing the niggers so that they will not harm
her until we can strike and he pushed
forward the safety-catch of his rifle and
looked along the sights

  i made no reply mercifully allowing
the poor lad to extract what comfort he
might from his idea in my own mind i
was sure that elna was not acting she
was dancing and leaping like one pos-
sessed in her hand she brandished a long
straight-bladed knife her features were
working convulsively her eyes blazing
with mad excitement and as she danced
she drew nearer and ever nearer to the
helpless steward on the ground

  a horrible fascination gripped me as
i watched the ghastly drama so that i
seemed to lose all sense of my surround-
ings all the while floating through the
mist of horror and dreadful expectancy
that clouded my brain came the memory
of kemps words when he had hinted at
the unhallowed rites practised by the
red drinkers

  at last the end came

  with a laugh that was like the shrill
screech of a wild beast the frenzied girl
leapt at the helpless prisoner and plunged
her knife into his throat the horrified

wt-
the invisible bond



cry that rose to my lips was stifled by
another and even greater horror for the
creature who bore the outward semblance
to elna fanshaw had thrown herself full
length on her writhing victim and was
greedily sucking the living blood as it
gushed from the wound

  i can only conjecture what must have
been leslies state of mind at that mo-
ment for myself i seemed to be the vic-
tim of some ghastly nightmare from
which i must presently awake i simply
could not believe the evidence of my own
eyes as i saw the girl raise herself from
her ghoulish feast her victims life-blood
staining her delicate lips and running in
tiny rivulets down her ivory breasts and
standing erect with wide-flung arms give
voice to die exultant blood-call of the
ghu-fartfi

  at the sight something must have
snapped in the brain of the boy at my
side he threw his rifle to his shoulder
and the next moment the crash of its
discharge awoke the echoes of the forest

   i like to think that he intended the bul-
let for nzahgi but if so he must have
aimed badly it was elna who stiffened
suddenly as she stood poised like a crim-
soned vampire-stiffened swayed then
pitched forward and lay still

  a second later i pressed my trigger
and sent the witch-doctor down with a
bullet through his skull then leslie
dashed into the throng of startled sav-
ages swinging his clubbed rifle dealing
out death to every living thing within

his reach without a thought for his own
life i verily believe that at that moment
leslie wished to die if so he had his
wish the savages broke and ran for
cover but an arrow whizzed out of the
darkness and buried itself in his heart   

  as the dawn was stealing into the
eastern sky i laid the young husband and
wife in a grave which i dug near the spot
where they had died if fate had sun-
dered their lives so strangely in death at
least they were not divided

   i returned to the village to find it in
the hands of the natives the rest of our
party had been surprized in their sleep
and killed then i wandered into the
bush on and on until i saw your smoke
on the horizon   



that was the story told me in weak
gasping sentences as my ship shoul-
dered her way over the long rollers of
the tropic sea of its truth or falsity the
reader must judge for himself

   it may be possible that the infusion of
savage blood formed a bond invisible
but unbreakable between the gently
nurtured white girl and the fierce devil-
worshipper it may be that the whole ep-
isode is but a figment of a fever-ridden
brain

  at least it is certain that more will
never be known for the sole survivor of
the ill-fated primrose died at sundown
that day and the next morning we com-
mitted his body to the deep

a iveird story of upper michigan

the tree of life

       by paul ernst

it was cold god it was cold out-
side the cabin a blanket of february
snow showed leaden white under the
heavy midafternoon clouds a keening
wind growled through the bare-limbed
trees it rattled the dry boughs like the
fingers of skeletons and stole between
the slats of the crude window to twitch
at the shroud of the thing beneath

  it was from that sheeted stark figure
on the long bench that the greatest cold
seemed to emanate nothing can be colder
that a corpse nothing a corpse seems
to radiate a deathly chill that numbs the
heart of whoever is near it

  because of the shrouded body more
than because of the actual temperature
i was chilled to the bone in spite of my
inches of heavy clothing i got to my feet
and walked up and down the one room
of the cabin averting my eyes from the
figure on the bench

  then in an effort to conquer fear with
familiarity i crossed the room and lifted
the shroud from the hatchet face be-
neath

  an old woman looking far older than
her years because of her lifetime of
toil and disappointments the hair was
scant and yellow-gray the eyes open
and staring were like gray stones the
nose seemed to have projected even far-
ther in death than in life it jutted out
like the point of a wedge there was
nothing lovely in this pilgrim set out
for the farther shore there was nothing
reposeful here

  it was mrs whilom wife of ab
   

whilom our nearest farm neighbor
the old couple had been swindled out
of their modest ohio farm five years be-
fore in their old age they had been
forced to come to upper michigan bare-
handed to wrest-a living from the un-
familiar soil and now-this

  that noon my father and i had
hitched up for the twelve-mile drive over
laborious roads to town this was be-
fore the day of teeming autos and cement
highways in front of the whilom ca-
bin my father had pulled up the horses
and stopped

  standing before us was ab-a spare
gnarled man in whom age had curdled
like milk in a thunderstorm

  jest a minute he called coming to
the side of the wagon i need help

  anything we can do- my father

began amiably he stopped at the look
in abs eyes

  my old womans jest died he said
the words were as perfunctory as though
he had just announced that his hogs had
cholera but his eyes spoke for him they
were dazed hollowed out with sense of
loss

  somebodyd ought to stay with her
while i go to town for the undertaker
continued ab she couldnt never bide
being alone id hate to leave her alone
now

  my father turned to me doubtfully
speculatively

  think you can keep her company
son

  my look must have showed how re-
the tree of life



pulsive i found the idea of a lonely vigil
in the squalid cabin with a dead woman
for he hastened on

  never mind ill do it youre pretty
young   

   now the youth of youth is a sore point
his reminding me of my sixteen years
was sufficient to make me insist on stay-
ing there while he drove ab on into
town

  so here i was shivering in the mean
little hut beside the dead mrs whilom
blue with a cold that did not come en-
tirely from the winter wind but that
emanated straight from the shrouded
thing on the bench under the window

 replaced the sheet over the hawk
features and sat down before the
fireplace that psychic cold that struck
through jacket and mackinaw knee-high
boots and heavy socks i huddled closer
to the fire resolutely turning my eyes to
the leaping flames i did not want to look
toward the dead woman

   i wondered if the body in life housed
a deathless spirit as most people claim it
does i wondered where this womans
spirit was i fancied i knew what other
spirit it was with at the moment

  just before the land deal that had
cheated the whiloms out of their little
farm abs daughter had died the
daughter was an unfortunate creature
born blind and dull-witted and ugly
her whole life had been filled by mrs
whilom and the old lady to hear ab
tell it had concentrated all her frustrated
hopes and ambitions in a ferocious ma-
ternal flame of love for her unfortunate
child

  the two had talked without words
ab had once said the girls soul he
said was twisted around the mothers
like a creeper around a tree

  now was the daughter rejoined in
death by the only person that had ever

meant anything to her-the only light
that had shone in her warped blind
world-her mother was the daugh-
ters spirit hovering somewhere near come
to escort the spirit of her beloved parent

  i thought of these things as i huddled
miserably over a fire that could not warm
me and prayed the time would not be
too long in passing till my father and
ab got back with the undertaker

i turned to the wood-box which was
full to overflowing and dumped a
big armful of split hranches into the
fire this awful cold

   the fire roared higher as i fed it more
wood in an effort to counteract that
chilling cold i built a blaze that threat-
ened the safety of the cabin

   the first keen edge of my formless ter-
ror gradually wore off as all keen edges
do in time the psychic chill was less
numbing or possibly it was more
numbing i dont know perhaps my
fear was now so great that my nerves re-
fused to twitch to its stimulus any more
at any rate calm of a sort came over
me and with this unnatural stunned
calm there came a relief from the cold-
ness

  in spite of the open window covered
only by the few meager slats in spite of
the low temperature outside i began to
feel suffocated i was dressed to be com-
fortable at zero it must have been near-
ly  now in the low small room

  i took off my mackinaw and loosened
my collar then as my feet felt the
heat my boots began to bother me they
were new-and stiff as only new knee-
high boots can be i took them off too
and padded about in my heavy socks i
opened the door for a foot or so and
propped it with a piece of firewood

  trying to make my mind a blank i
sat down a good way from the scorch-
ing fire another two hours would be


weird tales

needed before the trip to town and back
could be concluded two hours two
centuries

  i sat there keeping my eyes on the
partly opened door so that i would not
see the way the drafts twitched like
ghostly fingers at the edge of the shroud

  there was a faint scratching on the
bare-swept step outside a small ta-
pered head in which were set two beady
eyes was poked inquisitively around the
edge of the door a wood-rat and an
astonishingly bold one driven past fear
no doubt by the attraction of the warmth
and the smell of food in the cupboard

  cautiously with many a spasmodic re-
treat it came into the cabin it kept its
hard little eyes warily on me i stayed
motionless glad of any distraction

  after perhaps five minutes of maneu-
vering it reached the center of the room
and crouched staring impudently up at
me i reached slowly down beside me
for one of my boots slowly-

  the wood-rat jerked toward the door
but stopped as my descending hand was
stayed it came back and now my
fingers were around the boot-top

  my hand snapped back and up the
rat raced for the door but a foot away
from it the flung boot chanced to catch
it squarely it kicked a little and lay
still with a fleck of red dabbling its
spiky repulsive whiskers

  i started up to throw the dead rat out
of the cabin when another scratching
sound on the step outside came to my
ears

  it was a second wood-rat and this
one was either entirely fearless or lost to
caution in its discovery of its fellows
fate

  without even a glance at me it
streaked from the door to the furry body
lying beside my boot it sniffed around
the dead rat with inquisitive nose and
stared at it with beady eyes then al-

most before i could follow its move-
ments it had streaked for the door again
and was gone

  almost at once it was back again and
in its mouth was a green leaf about the
size and shape of an oak leaf

  a green leaf green in the middle
of february in a region where winter is
unrelenting and iron-bound

  my face must have been a mask of stu-
pidity as i stared at that leaf where in
the name of all that was miraculous could
the rodent have found it there were no
green trees in the countryside at that time
of year i knew there were none yet
-here was this leaf

the rat was less quick this time less
bold it crept slowly toward the
stiffening body of its mate as it ad-
vanced it kept its glittering little eyes
directed - not toward me curiously
enough but toward the corpse

  there followed a most astounding
spectacle

  the rat began to scurry aimlessly
around the room as though something
were chasing it carefully holding the
amazing leaf clear of the floor it dodged
wildly from one wall to the other al-
ways keeping its eyes fixed on thin air in
front of it i was as completely disre-
garded as though i had not been there

  toward the improvised bier the rat
scurried only to double spasmodically
away from it and run under my very
chair had the thing gone mad i be-
gan to fumble for my other boot fear of
a bite overcoming my curiosity to see the
outcome of this inexplicable play

  the rat approached its dead mate
again keeping its eyes on a spot on the
wall over the body - as if there were
something there that was invisible to my
eyes

  with a quick move it placed the green
the tree of life



leaf squarely on the little stark body
and behold-a miracle

  the rat that was dead was no longer
dead under my very gaze it quivered
and came to life the legs jerked once
or twice the body twitched the crea-
ture rose limping and stiff and followed
its mate out the door

  my mind whirled in a blind chaos
that impossible green leaf-its contact
with the dead rat-the resurrection of the
little pest

  as had everyone else who lived in
that part of the state i had heard tales of
a fabulous tree of life somewhere in
the region there was said to be a tree that
could raise the dead at a mere touch the
myth had been handed down to the old-
timers by the indians my father had
heard the yarn from his father and had
told it to me when i was a youngster and
begged for a fairy-story

  it was a myth of course it was a
myth there could be no truth in such
a thing but-that wood-rat had surely
been dead and now it was alive

   i stared at the leaf still lying on the
floor like an oak leaf it was but of a
softer texture and a lighter green a
leaf from the tree-

  my gaze went fascinated from the
leaf to the body under the window

  a dead rat had come to life why
could not a dead human being both
were flesh both were made of the same
stuff and here to my hand was this
incredible green leaf

  i left my chair and picked it up it
seemed to curl about my fingers with a
life of its own it was soft as the softest
silk and warm-like no other leaf id
ever touched the feel of it went through
me like wine i seemed to expand to
grow larger than my own self

  clutching the leaf i started toward
the corpse as i went the numbing chill

that had paralyzed me before laid hold
of me again and suddenly as though
the touch of the leaf had given my eyes
new power i thought i saw something
wavering protectively over the dead body
i say thought because by now it was
early dusk and the misty shape i seemed
to see was so intermingled with the
gathering shadows that i could not be
sure also when i blinked my eyes to
test their veracity the vision disappeared

  i lifted up the shroud and started to
touch the leaf to the dead womans
face-

  icy fingers seemed to catch at my
wrist my hand was torn away

  will

   it was like a shower of ice-cold water
that whip-like crack of my name sound-
ing behind me i gasped with the sud-
denness of it combined as it was with
the sheer terror that had crept through
me at the fancied touch of those unseen
fingers

  my hand opened convulsively as
though caught up by some invisible force
the leaf whirled out the window and was
gone

  has anything happened to upset
you asked my father putting his hand
anxiously on my shoulder

  no i mumbled no nothing
at all has happened

  i thought i saw something blow out
of the window he persisted i made no
answer

  ab meanwhile was taking a last look
at the woman who had helped and cared
for him for so long

  shes happier now i reckon he
muttered shes with patty probly
with our poor blind daughter  

i never told them what had happened
in that cabin a kid of sixteen doesnt
tell such things hes too sure hell be
laughed at its only now when i am


weird tales

well along in years that i dare to relate
the affair and speculate about it

was the rat really dead possibly
not i am in no position to prove it did

i	merely imagine that wavering thing by
the corpse and the touch of those cold
fingers perhaps ones imagination is
apt to work overtime during such a vigil
could the spirit of the dead daughter
have really been in that room and did it

first chase the rat and then clutch at my
wrist in an effort to keep the mother from
being resurrected it sounds unbeliev-
able

  the only fact that i can reiterate is
that the leaf-in the midst of winter-
was green i saw it held it in my hand
what would have happened had 
touched it to the corpse i dont know
of course but i think  i think   

black chant imperial

    by robert e howard

               trumpets triumph in red disaster

       white skulls litter the broken sod

              and we who ride for the one black master
              howl at the iron gates of god

               temples rock and the singers falter

       lights go out in the rushing gloom-

                 slay the priest on his blackened altar

      rip the babe from the womans womb

       black be the night that locks around them

      they who chant of the good and light

       black be the pinions that shall confound them

       breaking their brains with a deadly fright

                praised be the prince that reigns forever
                throned in the shadows stark and grim

      where cypress moans by the midnight river-

       lift your goblets and drink to him

               virgins wail and a babe is whining
               nailed like a fly on a gory lance

       white on the skulls the stars are shining

      over them sweeps our demons dance

       trumpets bray and the stars are riven

shatter the altar blot the light

       from the bursting hells to the falling heaven
       we are kings of the world tonight
his wild dream was interwoven with reality

the phantom bus

      by w elwyn backus

out of the vagueness of the half-
dawn a dark bulk loomed to the
accompaniment of a dull rumble
to arthur strite waiting for his regular
bus-the big orange six-forty-five to the
city-this nondescript contraption which
usually preceded it by a minute or two
seemed more like a ghostly coffin than a
public conveyance its sweating black
sides glistened oilily in the gray light as it
passed him a single dim incandescent
lamp seen through the windows silhou-
etted stiffly nodding heads against the
background of a dingy interior then
the black bus was gone swallowed up in
the swirling december mist and fog

  as always a feeling of odd disquiet
possessed strite with the passing of this
conveyance-a fleeting impression of
mystery strangely repellent and defying
description of ill omen what manner
of passengers it carried or whence and
whither it traveled he did not know-
and cared less yet queerly enough the
affair had increasingly irritated and dis-
turbed him ever since his moving to
emerymont three weeks before

   just an old junk-heap that loops out
through norwood and back over this
direction a fellow commuter said in
answer to his question until this morn-
ing strite had refrained from what he
deemed the weakness of a query about
this thing for he had hesitated to give
definite shape to his senseless disquiet by
admitting any curiosity even to himself
i believe a couple of death-traps like that
one comprise the companys entire roll-
ing-stock his informant finished

   oh said strite mentally categorying
the bus line with several that operated a
sort of cross-country service between out-
lying sections of cincinnati of course
he reflected some concern had to serve
this need but he was conscious of a feel-
ing of relief that he did not have to use
that service

  arthur strite was boarding in emery-
mont with the ransons not because of
any liking for the make-believes the rab-
ble of bourgeoisie and scandalmongers
that peopled the little suburb but because
he did enjoy the shrubbery and lawns and
the quaintly designed houses despite the
crazy butting of garbage-can-studded
back yards against living-room windows
of adjoining homes he minded his own
business displaying no curiosity in the
neighbors or affairs of the place-which
was one of the reasons why he had not
discovered sooner the purpose of the bus
line mentioned

  the night of the same day he had
asked about the bus he found himself
pondering with some intentness in the
midst of an absent-minded perusal of the
evening comic sheet on the dingy con-
veyance that passed him each morning
why should that silly bus thus intrude
itself into his mind he smiled self-in-
dulgently and turned over to the sports
page the thing actually was becoming a
nuisance and for no logical reason
what should it matter to him how unin-
viting how disagreeable a box on wheels
those people rode in every morning

  nevertheless he dropped off to sleep
thinking about the ghostly bus




weird tales

  the same thing began to be the rule
on the nights that followed always that
ridiculous feeling of indefinable dread
would come over him would cling ten-
aciously to his thoughts from the moment
he happened to think of having seen the
shadowy bus that morning he had half
a notion to hail the confounded contrap-
tion some morning and see where it took
him just to dispel all this absurd air of
mystery about it which had so unaccount-
ably fastened upon him though perhaps
there was some reason for his strange
obsession after all not quite one year
before his fiancee doris tway had been
killed in a terrible bus crash he remem-
bered the crumpled remains of the fatal
bus which he had seen afterward vivid-
ly it too had been black and shabby
an odd girl-she had always said that if
die left first she would return for him
her idea of a joke of course but un-
usual

   in spite of his notion about hailing the
other bus strite did not ride it-not for
several weeks anyway although its daily
rumbling and jangling approach made
more eery by the shortening of the days
had driven that impression of weird mys-
tery deeper than ever into his waking
thoughts waking because so far the
dark bus had troubled him only during
the evenings before he retired

  however there came a night when he
dreamed that he obeyed an impulse and
boarded the strange bus

   he was conscious of a sickly odor as he
entered the rickety door which had slid
bade with a softness in strange contrast to
the outward clatter of the conveyance
the vizor of die operators cap was pulled
well down over his face as he leaned over
his levers strite felt the bus begin to
move oddly there was no vibration
none of the jarring rattle and bang he
had expected he might have been on a
river barge for all the motion he could

feel startled more by this unnatural
quiet than he could have been by the
loudest of banging or jolting he raised
his eyes toward the occupants of the bus
perhaps it was the strange effort this act
seemed to impose upon him at any rate
he awoke in that instant seized by un-
reasoning incomprehensible terror

  it was an hour before his taut nerves
had relaxed enough to let him drop off to
sleep-and not before he had vowed to
ride that bus in fact the next morning



strite did not ride the black bus the
next morning it was nearly seven
oclock when he opened his eyes from a
troubled sleep this meant that he would
be late to the office where he worked on
the other side of the city of course he
missed his regular bus and with it the
other too the daylight put a different
aspect upon things it would have been
ridiculous after all to board a bus bound
for another part of the city merely to
humor a crazy impulse

  yet when that night came strite hes-
itated to go to bed he told himself that
he was hopeless a fool and a coward
then he undressed and resolutely turned
out the light

  his hesitancy had not been unfounded
again he found himself boarding the
mysterious sweating conveyance with its
leaning operator and strange illusive
odor and again a sudden agonized
awakening

  but this time he saw the other occu-
pants before he awoke they all-there
were six of them-had their eyes closed
as they sat nodding slightly with the
almost imperceptible swaying of the bus
there was a repellent something about
those faces other than their closed eye-
lids that struck a chill into strites heart
he wondered whether they were just
weary like him or-
the phantom bus



  a cold finger touched his wrist he
managed to turn and face the operator
the latter his face still hidden was point-
ing to the fare box of course these ill-
built ill-kept buses would reverse things
by demanding their fare when one
entered he reached into his pocket for
a dime and in that moment caught sight
of a seventh passenger seated in front on
the other side the operator s head and
shoulders had partly hidden her from
him before despite her slender tallness

  as his fingers found and automatically
brought forth a dime he observed that
this passengers eyes were not closed like
the rest-that they were pale gray and
staring at him they were like-oh god
it couldnt be-doris but it was-it
was how could he have failed to recog-
nize her sooner despite her position on
the other side of the operator now he
could understand why this bus had
drawn him so strangely irresistibly

  as he stared back at her speechless
with amazement her eyes left his face
turned toward the windshield her pale
lips twitched oddly as if mute with fear
at what she saw there she sought vainly
to scream

  then abruptly the spell was broken
she leaped to her feet throwing one arm
across her face in a gesture of one ward-
ing off some fearful harm a shrill hys-
terical scream pierced the quiet of that
closed space like the stab of a knife

  that cry jarred strite back to con-
sciousness with a suddenness that jerked
him upright in bed

  as he sat there trembling with the
realism of his dream and that agonized
scream he became aware that he held
something tightly in one closed hand a
fresh chill passed through his body at the
familiar feel of that something he
needed no light to tell him that it was a

dime he clutched-the dime he had been
ready to drop in the fare box of his
dream



of course he found that the coin evi-
dently had fallen out of his vest
when he sat on the bed while undressing
in fact he usually kept some change in
his vest pocket so as to have it handy for
tips newspapers and such perhaps the
accidental finding and touching of that
coin in his slumbers had even started the
train of thought that had made him dream
of the fare box-and the other things but
there was no more sleep for strite after
tossing about for the rest of the night he
got up about five oclock

  this morning he was determined upon
one thing he would ride the black bus-
the phantom bus as he had come to
term it privately-this morning and kill
for once and all this persistent subcon-
scious illusion that had taken root in his
mind from the seed of his first absurd im-
pression of the rickety conveyance in the
eery light of half-dawn

  once more his intention was to be de-
feated however the black bus failed to
appear before the six-forty-five though he
had arrived at its stop more than a quar
ter-hour before it was due he even
waited for it ten minutes after his regular
bus had gone-only to learn later that the
other line finally had been discontinued

  his first reaction to this information
was an overwhelming relief no longer
would he be reminded by this shadowy
rumbling hulk each morning of thingr
he wanted to forget

  but on the heels of this thought came
the realization that the very discontinu-
ance of the line had removed all chancc
of his ever killing the illusion if the latter
continued to trouble him


weird tales

  that day at noon as he walked along a
downtown street a peculiar odor halted
him there was an illusive dread
familiarity about it he was before a
florists open shop and a great bowl of
tuberoses those once choice flowers for all
those departed was set out in front he
knew now where he had smelled their
scent before-on the phantom bus of his
dream



once again strite was in the phantom
bus-in his subconscious mind this
time he knew exactly what was coming
he seemed powerless to change a single
detail of it all the pause just inside the
doorway as he forced his gaze up to where
the six passengers sat in plain view their
eyes closed in death-like weariness or
worse the icy touch of a finger on his
wrist the reaching for a coin and the dis-
covery of the slender tall girl up front
doris

  at this point the sequence of events
suddenly galvanized him into a feverish
alertness for the next thing as doris
hysterical scream rang in his ears he was
abruptly released from the grip of im-
mobility he turned quickly and looked
out of the front of the bus

  what he saw there made him throw up
his hands in an involuntary gesture simi-
lar to her own instinctive gesture of ter-
ror he heard the brakes squealing
shrilly-felt the bus skid on the sleet-
covered road even as he caught a side
glimpse of the operators face-saw with
sudden added horror that half the face
was missing beyond that fleeting glimpse
he had time for no further examination
for just ahead a heavily loaded truck was
emerging from a narrow bridge-end
blocking their way then a terrific rend-
ing crash   



the six-forty-five bus was four min-
utes late on account of the icy con-
dition of the roads they had been that
way for two days a little group of com-
muters on the roadside were talking in
subdued tones for once unmindful of the
delay as they waited

  personally a pompous red-faced
man was saying i believe ranson killed
and-mauled-him for attentions to
mrs ranson

  but strite didnt appear to be that
type objected a young member of the
group nor is mrs ranson the sort who
would encourage him besides consider
the condition of the body why ranson
or no one else could have so mangled an-
other-to say nothing of leaving it in bed
and persistently claiming that he didnt
know how it happened except that he
and his wife were awakened in the mid-
dle of the night by a frightful cry-and
found him that way no i say there is
some deeper mystery about the affair the
nature of which we havent suspected

   the big orange-colored bus hove into
view at this juncture interrupting the dis-
cussion for the time presently they all
had boarded it and found seats at various
vantage-points a little distance along the
road one of them pointed out to his neigh-
bor a twisted and splintered mass of
wreckage at the foot of an embankment
of the narrow bridge they were just then
crossing

  lucky it jumped off when it struck-
didnt even delay us yesterday when we
followed a few minutes after it was dis-
covered

   queer thing about how it got there
said the other nobody witnessed the
accident and the defunct bus companys
officials swear that the last they saw of
their death trap was when it was locked
beyond the door



away in an old garage on the other side
of norwood can you imagine any one
swiping a can like that for a ride but the
present-day young coke-head will grab
anything for a joy-ride

  no queerer than that-that mess in-
side the wreck-as if some one had been
crushed like-well like poor strite for
instance yet they could find no trace of
a body

beyond the door

by paul suter

ttou havent told me yet how it

  y	happened i said to mrs mal-
       kin

she set her lips and eyed me sharply

  didnt you talk with the coroner
sir

  yes of course i admitted but as
i understand you found my uncle i
thought-

well i wouldnt care to say anything
about it she interrupted with decision

  this housekeeper of my uncles was
somewhat taller than i and much heavier
-two physical preponderances which
afford any woman possessing them an
advantage over the inferior male she
appeared a subject for diplomacy rather
than argument

  noting her ample jaw her breadth of
cheek the unsentimental glint of her eye
i decided on conciliation i placed a chair
for her there in my uncle godfreys
study and dropped into another myself

at least before we go over the other

   prom weird tales april 

parts of the house suppose we rest a
little i suggested in my most unctuous
manner the place rather gets on ones
nerves-dont you think so

  it was sheer luck-i claim no credit
for it my chance reflection found the
weak spot in her fortifications she re-
plied to it with an undoubted smack of
satisfaction

  its more than seven years that ive
been doing for mr sarston sir bring-
ing him his meals regular as clockwork
keeping the house clean-as clean as hed
let me-and sleeping at my own home
o nights and in all that time ive said
over and over there aint a house in new
york the equal of this for queemess
nor anywhere else i encouraged
her with a laugh and her confidences
opened another notch

  youre likely right in that too sir
as ive said to poor mr sarston many a
time its all well enough says i to
have bugs for a hobby you can afford
it and being a bachelor and by your-


weird tales

self you dont have to consider other
peoples likes and dislikes and its all
well enough if you want to says i to
keep thousands and thousands o them in
cabinets all over the place the way you
do but when it comes to pinnin them
on the walls in regular armies i says
and on the ceiling of your own study
and even on different parts of the furni-
ture so that a body dont know what
awful thing shes a-goin to find under
her hand of a sudden when she does the
dusting why then i says to him its
drivin a decent woman too far 

  and did he never try to reform his
ways when you told him that i asked
smiling

  to be frank with you mr robinson
when i talked like that to him he gener-
ally raised my pay and what was a body
to do then

  i cant see how lucy lawton stood
the place as long as she did i observed
watching mrs malkins red face very
closely

  she swallowed the bait and leaned
forward hands on knees

  poor girl it got on her nerves but
she was the quiet kind you never saw
her sir

  i shook my head

  one of them slim faded girls with
light hair and hardly a word to say for
herself i dont believe she got to know
the next-door neighbor in the whole year
she lived with your uncle she was an or-
phan wasnt she sir

  yes i said godfrey sarston and
i were her only living relatives that
was why she came from australia to stay
with him after her fathers death

  mrs malkin nodded i was hoping
that by putting a check on my eagerness
i could lead her on to a number of things
i greatly desired to know up to the time
i had induced the housekeeper to show
me through this strange house of my

 uncle godfreys the whole affair had
 been a mystery of lips which closed and
 faces which were averted at my approach
 even the coroner seemed unwilling to tell
 me just how my uncle had died

 fv id you understand she was going to
 live with him sir asked mrs
 malkin looking hard at me

   i confined myself to a nod

    well so did i yet after a year back
 she went

   she went suddenly i suggested

   so suddenly that i never knew a thing
 about it till after she was gone i came
 to do my chores one day and she was
 here i came the next and she had
 started back to australia thats how
 sudden she went

   they must have had a falling-out i
 conjectured i suppose it was because of
 the house

   maybe it was and maybe it wasnt
   you know of other reasons

   i have eyes in my head she said
 but im not going to talk about it shall
 we be getting on now sir

    i tried another lead

   i hadnt seen my uncle in five years
 you know he seemed terribly changed
 he was not an old man by any means

 yet when i saw him at the funeral-

 i paused expectantly

   to my relief she responded readily

 -	he looked that way for the last few
 months especially the last week i spoke
 to him about it two days before-before
 it happened sir-and told him hed do
 well to see the doctor again but he cut
 me off short my sister took sick the same
 day and i was called out of town the

 next time i saw him he was-

   she paused and then went on sob-
 bing to think of him lyin there in that
 awful place and callin and callin for
 me as i know he must and me not
 around to hear him
beyond the door



  as she stopped again suddenly and
 threw a suspicious glance at me i has-
 tened to insert a matter-of-fact question

   did he appear ill on that last day

  not so much ill as-

  yes i prompted

  she was silent a long time while i
waited afraid that some word of mine
had brought back her former attitude of
hostility then she seemed to make up
her mind

   i oughtnt to say another word ive
said too much already but youve been
liberal with me sir and i know some-
thin youve a right to be told which im
thinkin no one else is a-goin to tell you
look at the bottom of his study door a
minute sir

  i followed her direction what i saw
led jtne to drop to my hands and knees
the better to examine it

  why should he put a rubber strip on
the bottom of his door i asked getting
up

  she replied with another enigmatical
suggestion look at these if you will
sir youll remember that he slept in this
study that was his bed over there in the
alcove

   bolts i exclaimed and i reinforced
sight with touch by shooting one of them
back and forth a few times double
bolts on the inside of his bedroom door
an upstairs room at that what was the
idea

  mrs malkin portentously shook her
head and sighed as one unburdening her
mind

  only this can i say sir he was
afraid of something-terribly afraid sir
something that came in the night

  what was it i demanded

   i dont know sir

  it was in the night that - it hap-
pened i asked

  she nodded then as if the prologue

were over as if she had prepared my
mind sufficiently she produced some-
thing from under her apron she must
have been holding it there all the time

   its his diary sir it was lying here
on the floor i saved it for you before the
police could get their hands on it

i opened the little book one of the
sheets near the back was crumpled and
i glanced at it idly what i read there
impelled me to slap the covers shut again
did you read this i demanded

  she met my gaze frankly

   i looked into it sir just as you did-
only just looked into it not for worlds
would i do even that again

   i noticed some reference here to a slab
in the cellar what slab is that

   it covers an old dried-up well sir
   will you show it to me

  you can find it for yourself sir if
you wish im not goin down there
she said decidedly

  ah well ive seen enough for to-
day i told her ill take the diary bade
to my hotel and read it

i did not return to my hotel however
in my one brief glance into the little
book i had seen something which had
bitten into my soul only a few words
but they had brought me very near to that
queer solitary man who had been my
uncle

  i dismissed mrs malkin and remained
in the study there was the fitting place
to read the diary he had left behind him

   his personality lingered like a vapor in
that study i settled into his deep morris
chair and turned it to catch the light
from the single narrow window - the
light doubtless by which he had written
much of his work on entomology

  that same struggling illumination
played shadowy tricks with hosts of wall-
crucified inseas which seemed engaged


weird tales

m a united effort to crawl upward in sin-
uous lines some of their number im-
paled to the ceiling itself peered quiver-
ingly down on the aspiring multitude
the whole house with its crisp dead
rustling in any vagrant breeze brought
back to my mind the hand that had
pinned them one by one on wall and
ceiling and furniture a kindly hand i
reflected though eccentric one not to be
turned aside from its single hobby

  when quiet peering uncle godfrey
went there passed out another of those
scientific enthusiasts whose passion for
exact truth in some one direction has ex-
tended the bounds of human knowledge
could not his unquestioned merits have
been balanced against his sin was it
necessary to even-handed justice that he
die face-to-face with horror struggling
with the thing he most feared i ponder
the question still though his body -
strangely bruised - has been long at rest

the entries in the little book began
with the fifteenth of june every-
thing before that date had been torn out
there in the room where it had been
written i read my uncle godfreys diary

  it is done i am trembling so that the
words will hardly form under my pen
but my mind is collected my course was
for the best suppose i had married her
she would have been unwilling to live in
this house at the outset her wishes
would have come between me and my
work and that would have been only the
beginning

  as a married man i could not have
concentrated properly i could not have
surrounded myself with the atmosphere
indispensable to the writing of my book
my scientific message would never have
been delivered as it is though my heart
is sore i shall stifle these memories in
work

  i wish i had been more gentle with
her especially when she sank to her
knees before me tonight she kissed my
hand i should not have repulsed her so
roughly in particular my words could
have been better chosen i said to her
bitterly get up and dont nuzzle my
hand like a dog she rose without a
word and left me how was i to know

that within an hour-

  i am largely to blame yet had i
taken any other course afterward than the
one i did the authorities would have mis-
understood

again there followed a space from
l which the sheets had been tom but
from the sixteenth of july all the pages
were intact something had come over
the writing too it was still precise and
clear-my uncle godfreys characteristic
hand-but the letters were less firm as
the entries approached the end this dif-
ference became still more marked

  here follows then the whole of his
story or as much of it as will ever be
known i shall let his words speak for
him without further interruption

  my nerves are becoming more serious-
ly affected if certain annoyances do not
shortly ceae i shall be obliged to procure
medical advice to be more specific i
find myself at times obsessed by an al-
most uncontrollable desire to descend to
the cellar and lift the slab over the old
well

  i never have yielded to the impulse
but it has persisted for minutes together
with such intensity that i have had to put
work aside and literally hold myself
down in my chair this insane desire
comes only in the dead of night when
its disquieting effect is heightened by the
various noises peculiar to the house

  for instance there often is a draft of
air along the hallways which causes a
beyond the door



rustling among the specimens impaled on
the walls lately too there have been
other nocturnal sounds strongly sugges-
tive of the busy clamor of rats and mice
this calls for investigation i have been
at considerable expense to make the house
proof against rodents which might de-
stroy some of my best specimens if some
structural defect has opened a way for
them the situation must be corrected at
once

  july th the foundations and cel-
lar were examined today by a workman
he states positively that there is no place
of ingress for rodents he contented him-
self with looking at the slab over the old
well without lifting it

   july th while i was sitting in this
chair late last night writing the impulse
to-descend to the cellar suddenly came
upon me with tremendous insistence i
yielded - which perhaps was as well
for at least i satisfied myself that the dis-
quiet which possessed me has no external
cause

  the long journey through the hall-
ways was difficult several times i was
keenly aware of the same sounds per-
haps i should say the same impressions
of sounds that i had erroneously laid to
rats i am convinced now that they are
mere symptoms of my nervous condition
further indications of this came in the
fact that as i opened the cellar door the
small noises abruptly ceased there was
no final scamper of tiny footfalls to sug-
gest rats disturbed at their occupations

   indeed i was conscious of a certain
impression of expectant silence - as if
the thing behind the noises whatever it
was had paused to watch me enter its
dominion throughout my time in the
cellar i seemed surrounded by this same
atmosphere sheer nerves of course

   in the main i held myself well under
control as i was about to leave the cel-
lar however i unguardedly glanced back

over my shoulder at the stone slab cover-
ing the old well at that a violent trem-
or came over me and losing all com-
mand i rushed back up the cellar stairs
thence to this study my nerves are play-
ing me sorry tricks

  july th for more than a week all
has been well the tone of my nerves
seems distinctly better mrs malkin
who has remarked several times lately
upon my paleness expressed the convic-
tion this afternoon that i am nearly my
old self again this is encouraging i
was beginning to fear that the severe
strain of the past few months had left an
indelible mark upon me with contin-
ued health i shall be able to finish my
book by spring

  july st mrs malkin remained
rather late tonight in connection with
some item of housework and it was quite
dark when i returned to my study from
bolting the street door after her the
blackness of the upper hall which the
former owner of the house inexplicably
failed to wire for electricity was pro-
found as i came to the top of the sec-
ond flight of stairs something clutched
at my foot and for an instant almost
pulled me back i freed myself and ran
to the study

  august rd again the awful insist-
ence i sat here with this diary upon my
knee and it seems that fingers of iron are
tearing at me i will not go my nerves
may be utterly unstrung again i fear
they are but i am still their master

  august th i did not yield last
night after a bitter struggle which must
have lasted nearly an hour the desire to
go to the cellar suddenly departed i
must not give in at any time

  august th tonight the rat noises
i shall call them that for want of a more
appropriate term are very noticeable i
went to the length of unbolting my door
and stepping into the hallway to listen


weird tales

after a few minutes i seemed to be
aware of something large and gray watch-
ing me from the darkness at the end of
the passage this is a bizarre statement
of course but it exactly describes my im-
pression i withdrew hastily into the
study and bolted the door

  now that my nervous condition is so
palpably affecting the optic nerve i must
not much longer delay seeing a specialist
but-how much shall i tell him

  august th several times tonight
while sitting here at my work i have
seemed to hear soft footsteps in the pas-
sage nerves again of course or else
some new trick of the wind among die
specimens on the walls

  august th by my watch it is four
oclock in the morning my mind is made
up to record the experience i have passed
through calmness may come that way

  feeling rather fatigued last night
from the strain of a weary day of re-
search i retired early my sleep was more
refreshing than usual as it is likely to be
when one is genuinely tired i awakened
however it must have been about an
hour ago with a start of tremendous
violence

  there was moonlight in the room
my nerves were on edge but for a mo-
ment i saw nothing unusual then
glancing toward the door i perceived
what appeared to be thin white fingers
thrust under it-exactly as if some one
outside the door were trying to attract my
attention in that manner i rose and
turned on the light but the fingers were
gone

  needless to say i did not open the
door i write the occurrence down just
as it took place or as it seemed but i can
not trust myself to comment upon it

  august th have fastened heavy
rubber strips on the bottom of my door

  august th all quiet for several
nights i am hoping that the rubber

strips being something definite and tan-
gible have had a salutary effect upon my
nerves perhaps i shall not need to see a
doaor

  august th once more i have been
aroused from sleep the interruptions
seem to come always at the same hour-
about three oclock in the morning i had
been dreaming of the well in the cellar
-the same dream over and over-every-
thing black except the slab and a figure
with bowed head and averted face sitting
there also i had vague dreams about a
dog can it be that my last words to her
have impressed that on my mind i must
pull myself together in particular i
must not under any pressure yield and
visit the cellar after nightfall

  august th am feeling much more
hopeful mrs malkin remarked on it
while serving dinner this improvement
is due largely to a consultation i have had
with dr sartwell the distinguished spe-
cialist in nervous diseases i went into
full details with him excepting certain
reservations he scouted the idea that my
experiences could be other than purely
mental

  when he recommended a change of
scene which i had been expeaing i
told him positively that it was out of the
question he said then that with the aid
of a tonic and an occasional sleeping-
draft i am likely to progress well enough
at home this is distinaly encouraging
i erred in not going to him at the start
without doubt most if not all of my
hallucinations could have been averted

  i have been suffering a needless pen-
alty from my nerves for an aaion i took
solely in the interests of science i have
no disposition to tolerate it further from
today i shall report regularly to dr sart-
well

  august th used the sleeping-draft
last night with gratifying results the
doaor says i must repeat the dose for

wt-
beyond the door



several nights until my nerves are well
under control again

   august st all well it seems that
i have found the way out-a very simple
and prosaic way i might have avoided
much needless annoyance by seeking ex-
pert advice at the beginning before re-
tiring last night i unbolted my study
door and took a turn up and down the
passage i felt no trepidation the place
was as it used to be before these fancies
assailed me a visit to the cellar after
nightfall will be the test for my complete
recovery but i am not yet quite ready
for that patience

  august nd i have just read yes-
terdays entry thinking to steady myself
it is cheerful-almost gay and there are
other entries like it in preceding pages
i am a mouse in the grip of a cat let
me have freedom for ever so short a time
and i begin to rejoice at my escape then
the paw descends again

  it is four in the morning-the usual
hour i retired rather late last night
after administering the draft instead of
the dreamless sleep which heretofore has
followed the use of the drug the slumber
into which i fell was punctuated by recur-
rent visions of the slab with the bowed
figure upon it also i had one poignant
dream in which the dog was involved

  at length i awakened and reached
mechanically for the light switch beside
my bed when my hand encountered
nothing i suddenly realized the truth i
was standing in my study with my other
hand upon the doorknob it required
only a moment of course to find the
light and switch it on i saw then that
the bolt had been drawn back

  the door was quite unlocked my
awakening must have interrupted me in
the very act of opening it i could hear
something moving restlessly in the pas-
sage outside the door

   august rd i must beware of sleep-
wt-

ing at night without confiding the fact
to dr sartwell i have begun to take the
drug in the daytime at first mrs mal-
kins views on the subject were pro-
nounced but my explanation of doctors
orders has silenced her i am awake for
breakfast and supper and sleep in the
hours between she is leaving me each
evening a cold lunch to be eaten at mid-
night

  august th several times i have
caught myself nodding in my chair the
last time i am sure that on arousing i
perceived the rubber strip under the door
bent inward as if something were push-
ing it from the other side i must not
under any circumstances permit myself to
fall asleep

  september nd mrs malkin is to be
away because of her sisters illness i can
not help dreading her absence though
she is here only in the daytime even that
companionship is very welcome

  september rd let me put this into
writing the mere labor of composition
has a soothing influence upon me god
knows i need such an influence now as
never before

   in spite of all my watchfulness i fell
asleep tonight-across my bed i must
have been utterly exhausted the dream
i had was the one about the dog i was
patting the creatures head over and over

  i awoke at last to find myself in
darkness and in a standing position
there was a suggestion of chill and
earthiness in the air while i was drow-
sily trying to get my bearings i became
aware that something was nuzzling my
hand as a dog might do

  still saturated with my dream i was
not greatly astonished i extended my
hand to pat the dogs head that
brought me to my senses i was stand-
ing in the cellar

  the thing before me was not a dog

  i can not tell how i fled back up the


weird tales

cellar stairs i know however that as i
turned the slab was visible in spite of
the darkness with something sitting upon
it all the way up the stairs hands
snatched at my feet

this entry seemed to finish the diary
for blank pages followed it but i
remembered the crumpled sheet near the
back of the book it was partly torn out
as if a hand had clutched it convulsively
the writing on it too was markedly in
contrast to the precise albeit nervous pen-
manship of even the last entry i had
perused i was forced to hold the scrawl
up to the light to decipher it this is
what i read

  my hand keeps on writing in spite
of myself what is this i do not wish
to write but it compels me yes yes i
will tell the truth i will tell the truth
a heavy blot followed partly covering
the writing with difficulty i made it
out

  the guilt is mine - mine only i
loved her too well yet i was unwilling to
marry though she entreated me on her
knees - though she kissed my hand i
told her my scientific work came first
she did it herself i was not expecting
that-i swear i was not expecting it but
i was afraid the authorities would mis-
understand so i took what seemed the
best course she had no friends here who
would inquire

  it is waiting outside my door i feel
it it compels me through my thoughts
my hand keeps on writing i must not
fall asleep i must think only of what i

am writing i must-

  then came the words i had seen when
mrs malkin had handed me the book
they were written very large in places
the pen had dug through the paper
though they were scrawled i read them
at a glance

  not the slab in the cellar not that

oh my god anything but that any-
thing-

  by what strange compulsion was the
hand forced to write down what was in
the brain even to the ultimate thoughts
even to those final words

the gray light from outside slanting
down through two dull little win-
dows sank into the sodden hole near the
inner wall the coroner and i stood in
the cellar but not too near the hole

  a small demonstrative dark man -
the chief of detectives - stood a little
apart from us his eyes intent his natural
animation suppressed we were watch-
ing the stooped shoulders of a police con-
stable who was angling in the well

  see anything walters inquired the
detective raspingly

  the policeman shook his head

  the little man turned his questioning
to me

  youre quite sure he demanded

  ask the coroner he saw the diary
i told him

  im afraid there can be no doubt
the coroner confirmed in his heavy tired
voice

  he was an old man with lack-luster
eyes it had seemed best to me on the
whole that he should read my uncles
diary his position entitled him to all
the available facts what we were seek-
ing in the well might especially concern
him

  he looked at me opaquely now while
the policeman bent double again then
he spoke-like one who reluctantly and
at last does his duty he nodded toward
the slab of gray stone which lay in the
shadow to the left of the well

  it doesnt seem very heavy does it
he suggested in an undertone

  i shook my head still its stone i
beyond the door



demurred a man would have to be
rather strong to lift it

  to lift it-yes he glanced about
the cellar ah i forgot he said
abruptly it is in my office as part of
the evidence he went on half to him-
self a man-even though not very
strong-could take a stick-for instance
the stick that is now in my office-and
prop up the slab if he wished to look
into the well he whispered

  the policeman interrupted straighten-
ing again with a groan and laying his
electric torch beside the well

  its breaking my back he com-
plained theres dirt down there it
seems loose but i cant get through it
somebodyll have to go down

   the detective cut in im lighter than
you walters

   im not afraid sir

   i didnt say you were the little man
snapped theres nothing down there
anyway - though well have to prove
that i suppose he glanced truculently
at me but went on talking to the con-
stable rig the rope around me and
dont bungle the knot ive no intention
of falling into the place

  there is something there whispered
the coroner slowly to me his eyes left
the little detective and the policeman
carefully tying and testing knots and
turned again to the square slab of stone

  suppose-while a man was looking
into that hole-with the stone propped
up - he should accidentally knock the
prop away he was still whispering

  a stone so light that he could prop
it up wouldnt be heavy enough to kill
him i objected

  no he laid a hand on my shoul-
der not to kill him-to paralyze him
-if it struck the spine in a certain way
to render him helpless but not uncon-
scious the post mortem would disclose
that through the bruises on the body

  the policeman and the detective had
adjusted the knots to their satisfaction
they were bickering now as to the details
of the descent

  would that cause death i whis-
pered

  you must remember that the house-
keeper was absent for two days in two
days even that pressure-he stared at
me hard to make sure that i understood
-with the head down-

  again the policeman interrupted ill
stand at the well if you gentlemen will
grab the rope behind me it wont be
much of a pull ill take the brunt of it

  we let the little man down with the
electric torch strapped to his waist and
some sort of implement-a trowel or a
small spade-in his hand it seemed a
long time before his voice curiously hol-
low directed us to stop the hole must
have been deep

  we braced ourselves i was second
the coroner last the policeman relieved
his strain somewhat by snagging the rope
against the edge of the well but i mar-
veled nevertheless at the ease with which
he held the weight very little of it came
to me

   a noise like muffled scratching reached
us from below occasionally the rope
shook and shifted slightly at the edge of
the hole at last the detectives hollow
voice spoke

  what does he say the coroner de-
manded

  the policeman turned his square
dogged face toward us

  i think hes found something he ex-
plained

  the rope jerked and shifted again
some sort of struggle seemed to be going
on below the weight suddenly in-
creased and as suddenly lessened as if
something had been grasped then had
managed to elude the grasp and slip
away i could catch the detectives rapid


weird tales

breathing now also the sound of inartic-
ulate speech in his hollow voice

  the next words i caught came more
clearly they were a command to pull
up at the same moment the weight on
the rope grew heavier and remained so

  the policemans big shoulders began
straining rhythmically

  all together he directed take it
easy pull when i do

  slowly the rope passed through our
hands with each fresh grip that we
took a small section of it dropped to the
floor behind us i began to feel the strain
i could tell from the coroners labored
breathing that he felt it more being an
old man the policeman however
seemed untiring

  the rope tightened suddenly and
there was an ejaculation from below-
just below still holding fast the police-
man contrived to stoop over and look
he translated the ejaculation for us

  let down a little hes stuck with it
against the side

  we slackened the rope until the de-
tectives voice gave us the word again

  the rhythmic tugging continued some-
thing dark appeared quite abruptly at
the top of the hole my nerves leapt in
spite of me but it was merely the top of
the detectives head - his dark hair
something white came next - his pale
face with staring eyes then his shoul-
ders bowed forward the better to sup-
port what was in his arms then-

  i looked away but as he laid his bur-
den down at the side of the well the
detective whispered to us

  he had her covered up with dirt-
covered up  

  he began to laugh - a little high

cackle like a childs-until the coroner
took him by the shoulders and deliberate-
ly shook him then the policeman led
him out of the cellar

it was not then but afterward that i
put my question to the coroner

  tell me i demanded people pass
there at all hours why didnt my uncle
call for help

  i have thought of that he replied
i believe he did call i think probably
he screamed but his head was down
and he couldnt raise it his screams
must have been swallowed up in the
well

  you are sure he didnt murder her
he had given me that assurance before
but i wished it again

  almost sure he declared though it
was on his account undoubtedly that she
killed herself few of us are punished
as accurately for our sins as he was

  one should be thankful even for
crumbs of comfort i am thankful

  but there are times when my uncles
face rises before me after all we were
the same blood our sympathies had much
in common under any given circum-
stances our thoughts and feelings must
have been largely the same i seem to see
him in that final death march along the
unlighted passageway - obeying an im-
perative summons-going on step by
step-down the stairway to the first floor
down the cellar stairs-at last lifting the
slab

  i try not to think of the final expiation
yet was it final i wonder did the last
door of all when it opened find him
willing to pass through or was some-
thing waiting beyond that door
the stories of clark ashton smith have aroused tremendous enthusiasm in our
readers mr smith whose poetry has been one of the brightest features of
weird tales is now hailed by many as a new find in the fiction world be-
cause of the high literary quality and compelling fantasy of his short tales in this
magazine

   v p miner of sacramento california writes to the eyrie just a note of appre-
ciation nothing more a man and his work-no matter how great his tasks-must oc-
casionally be compelled to pause now and then and listen for echoes lately i have
come upon a story now and then by clark ashton smith i believe you have recog-
nized an artist and put him to work his stories have care there are beauty and art in
every line his imagination is distinct the mystery of his background is amazing
and within it all there exists a philosophy i believe you have reached out among the
thousands of present-day writers and placed your hands on a real find i desire to
express the kind sentiments of this household for the rich hours of entertainment that
the stories in weird tales have given us

   a letter from frank l pollock of shedden ontario says in looking over a copy
of your magazine i came upon quite an extraordinary story called the last incanta-
tion by clark ashton smith i have reread it several times and can not refrain from
writing you to remark upon its very unusual literary quality it has in fact the very
quality of poe at his best-with perhaps a touch of lord dunsany

   the hot seat wraith story in the june issue was well done writes h g rowell
of new york city evidently the author had been there or talked with some one
who had the autopsy incision clinched the truth of the thing i judge sing sing was
meant

   writes brush hatcher of honolulu in a letter to the eyrie permit me to pen a
word of compliment for seabury quinn on his clever amusing jules de grandin
stories he presented a well-handled theme in the brain-thief he manages dialogue
dexterously you ask your readers to report on the story they preferred in the last
issue the end of the story by clark ashton smith struck me as deserving the medal
of honor in the may edition smith writes easily compactly and without affectation
he has a nice selection of detail a neat logical plot and a delightful manner of ex-
position i shall be pleased to read more of his stories

   i have eagerly secured every issue of weird tales since i was first introduced to
it about a year ago by a friend writes h e nenzel of dundalk maryland hav-

                                                                                            


weird tales

ing seen many readers request reprints of h p lovecrafts works i was all excited
when i saw that you had reprinted the rats in the walls for sheer weirdness and
horror this story is hard to beat lovecraft is the best of them all and i would like
to see more reprints of his earlier works as i missed most of them when first pub-
lished the scientific stories by edmond hamilton are by far the best i have read any-
where especially his stories about the adventures of the interstellar patrol your mag-
azine satisfies me in every way as i have always been an avid reader of uncommon
stories

  ron h donachy of kane pennsylvania rushes to the defense of the cover designs
which have been severely criticized in the eyrie in recent issues while reading in
the eyrie of the june issue the excellent letter of bernard austin dwyer of kings-
ton he writes i hit upon one portion thereof in which i do in no way agree with
the gentleman named this is in regard to the cover designs so unjustly termed raw
rank sex appeal by mr dwyer why should not the public mind run along the above
named channels when we know that we are so beautifully and wonderfully made
and who has become so unseeing that he can not behold beauty and charm in the sym-
metry of the human form en nude does it not portray weird temptation allure-
ment and mystery of itself or perhaps does mr dwyer expea you to portray as a
cover design the loathsome horror of mr lovecrafts dunwich honor or his silver
key or perhaps the terrible phantoms of the planet of horror in the june issue
and have the public turn sick with revulsion from the very sight thereof no no a
thousand times no for my part i am perfealy satisfied with the cover designs and
can conceive of no way where any change would be an improvement in the least i
will agree with h p stiller of new york that h p lovecrafts dunwich horror is
truly a classic worthy of being preserved for posterity as likewise is his silver key of
which much of the subjea matter therein i deem a true history of the mental processes
of the present race and age and i believe that next or equal to these two great works
of lovecraft is the hounds of tindalos by frank belknap long jr published about
a year ago i have read these three stories over at least half a dozen times and i assure
you that when i desire to read something with a thrill and a deep mystery that i can
find nowhere else i again turn to one of these works for with each reading i always
find something there that i hadnt seen before

  r gage of vancouver british columbia writes to the eyrie i am not going to
read any more of your magazines if i find any more of those queer french names like
in the brain-thief by s quinn if i liked to hear french names id live in france
also i think your stories are not so much weird as they are crazy

  the june issue was certainly fine probably because it contained a de grandin
story writes edwin beard of st louis when will i cease to rave over that myth-
ical man and i do not as a certain gentleman suggested in the eyrie rave over him
because others do i think for myself now and always i would like to read more
for weird tales my personal opinion and all my professors count it worthy of con-
sideration is that your magazine has more literary merit for the price than any maga-
zine printed which is devoted chiefly to fiction

  readers what is your favorite story in this issue the most popular story in the
july number as shown by your votes was the last installment of the moon of skulls
the solomon kane story by robert e howard the bride of dewer by seabury
quinn was a close second to mr howards story
the eyrie



stories of the overlord of cornwall by doctor keller i enjoyed them immensely
especially no other man the planet of horror fell flat for me it strove to reach
the blood-freezing heights attained in the space-eaters but failed utterly i like my
horrors concrete most of the time abstract only once in a while the rats in the walls
was certainly chilling especially the last two columns please reprint the infidels
daughter or the woman of the wood they are nothing less than classics i am
simply wild over stories like the girl from samarcand i hope more are printed
and what has become of greye la spina i never see his or is it her stories any
more a new serial by greye la spina will begin in our october issue-the edi-
tors

  i thought the last issue of weird tales a particularly strong one writes clark
ashton smith the gruesome stories such as in the borderland and the frog
were especially good but of course die real event was the reprint of lovecrafts the
rats in the walls i was pleased to see a story by long announced for the next issue
long has a rare imaginative gift and a distinctive style that is beholden to nobody

  do you ever get letters from bona fide english teachers writes don c hilsing-
er of st louis michigan i am one myself but i am not oae of those teachers who
believe that no literature was written before or after shakespeare neither do i avow
browning to have been the last real poet in fact my favorite poets and authors are
not all dead and what is more i defend them against the invectives of my professors
on several occasions i have mentioned weird tales only to have it scorned as only
a ph d in english can scorn a magazine then one day i saw the list of stories that
this ph d was teaching in his short-story class ha ha ha i had read several of
them in weird tales and i told him so he registered a very operatic expression of
surprize and said is that so then he proceeded to ponder on the subject for a
while and finally gave his decision to the effect that if you published in your monthly
reprint section such stories as the ones i mentioned the rest of your stories would
have to be good too or your readers would object to them by comparison score six

another dracula

                        continued from page 

they stopped directly under my window
-i could have hit them with a shoe
why didnt you

  because i preferred to sit and watch
them didnt want to scare them away
but why didnt you shoot them
the farmer for whom i worked
didnt let any of the farmhands keep
guns so the two lions finally trotted off
again into the woods

  but that wasnt the adventure you
were going to tell me about was it
asked mary a bit disappointedly

  no replied crane the adventure
happened the following night again i
was lying awake listening to the cries of
the pair as they called to each other from
range to range and again the two an-
imals met between the farm and the lake
but this time their cries then ceased
what silent devilment were they up to

i	wondered and then i heard the pump
stop it was my turn to go down to the
lake and fix it

  you poor dear murmured mary
how old were you

  only eleven naturally i was scared
to death but i had to go for it was my
turn i begged each of the other farm-
hands one by one to go with me but
they all refused so i lit a lantern and set
off alone through the woods not a
sound from the mountain lions if only
they would howl so that i could tell
where they were and what they were up
to but they kept absolutely silent some-
how i reached the lake shore got the
pump going again and started bade up
the road toward home i was just begin-
ning to recover from my stupor of abject
terror when upon rounding a curve of
the path i saw in front of me two green
spots of phosphorescent light instantly

i	stopped dead in my tracks absolutely
petrified

   i can well believe it interjected the
girl you poor little kid

  dr crane continued and then the
beast came toward me at least i judged
that he was coming toward me for the
two phosphorescent eyes seemed to get
wider and wider apart in an attempt at
frightening him i swung my lantern
widely-and the lantern went out i was
alone in the darkness with that thing up
the road yet still the two spots of light
glowed even though there was now no
lantern for them to reflea instinctively i
felt that this was strange but i was too
scared to do any real thinking on the sub-
ject wider and wider apart got the two
eyes what a huge beast this must be

i	thought from a distant ridge there
came the blood-curdling scream of a lion
fascinated i waited for the beast in front
of me to answer its mate but the answer
came from an entirely different quarter
far away can there be three of them

i	wondered and then with a flash of in-
spiration i stepped fearlessly forward
right between the two eyes which were
facing me they were nothing but two
glow-worms crawling on the dirt of the
road

  well of all the yarns exclaimed
mary a bit exasperated here i have
been getting up a lot of sympathy for you
and you werent any more in danger of
being eaten alive than i am right now

  but i really was frightened terribly
so protested the young doctor a bit
apologetically

there was a pause while the two sat
and watched the moonlight on the
gently swaying treetops of the mountain-
side
weird tales



  then mary asked you have spoken
of the terrifying scream of the mountain
lions what was it like can you de-
scribe it to me

  thats a pretty big order laughed

the young doaor for a lions scream is

different from anything else i have ever

heard its just simply horrible-makes

the hairs stand up on the back of your

neck and brings out goose-pimples all

over your body the nearest thing to it

that i ever heard was a little child once

shrieking with pain in a hospital its-
i 
its-

  as he paused groping in his mind for
a simile the calm night air was split by
one single ghostly shriek coming from
the woods just below them on the moun-
tainside

  marys pale face turned even paler as
she sat suddenly erea in her chair and
convulsively gripped the doaors arm

  what-what was that ralph she
gasped

  that replied he was a mountain
lion

  tensely the two of them awaited a
repetition of the sound but it never
came that single fearsome howl was the
only one

  gradually they relaxed again

  what will you do asked the girl
solicitously i cant bear to have you go
home through the woods now that this
has happened you might meet that-
that awful thing and im scared to be
left here alone with only the fosses you
must stay with me ralph spend the
night please do mrs foss can fix you
up a cot somehow

  so dr crane spent the night in mary
mortons little mountain cabin

 bats and other things

tons cabin he was furious even the
fact of the presence of mr and mrs foss
in the cabin as chaperones did not in the
least mitigate his anger

  his fiancee had been compromised he
himself had been made ridiculous to a
banker or businessman there is nothing
worse than ridicule many a man would
let his business go to smash rather than
run the risk of ridicule to save it and
here was ridicule to no practical end
why it might even result in a run on the
bank

  the only way to save his face was to
take some drastic action at once ac-
cordingly he did he asked dr crane to
withdraw from the case and when the
doctor refused to withdraw herman fired
him herman was in a position to do
this as he was paying the bills old dr
porter was placed in charge instead

  the reason for the change as given
out to such persons as had any right to
ask was that dr crane had unduly ter-
rified his patient by getting her off in a
lonely shack in the mountains and then
telling her ghost stories indeed mary
was so frightened by that single unex-
plained piercing scream of a mountain
lion that she insisted on being moved
back to civilization the very next day
altogether everything fitted in to make
hermans explanation sound most plaus-
ible and really dr crane was open to
considerable censure for telling mary the
lion story in her condition and location

  he accepted his removal gracefully
and conferred lengthily with his successor
who brought a new viewpoint to the
situation

  old dr porter after a rather cursory
examination of mary morton and a study
of the case-history announced this
acute anemia appears to me to be due to
some cause which we havent yet fath-
omed you were probably taught at
harvard medical that anemia is a disease

but the more modern theory seems to be
that it is a mere symptom the result of
one of a large number of varying causes
many of which have been run to earth
but many more of which still remain un-
explained

  the younger doctor agreed

  ill admit said he that you older
men are apt to be more progressive than
our generation we accept as gospel
truth what we were taught at the school
whereas you have been out in practise
long enough to realize how little is
really known of the human body hence
you are more open-minded to new ideas
than we have you any theory as to the
underlying cause of miss mortons
symptoms

   not yet replied dr porter judicious-
ly but i believe that i have at least dis-
cerned the group in which her ailment
falls her bloodlessness seems to me to
be due to some organism some creature
that is sapping her strength i shouldnt

wonder-

  he paused with a bit of embarrassment
and then went on you know years ago
when i was a young man just out of col-
lege i made a trip to the argentine one
of the horses on a ranch where i was
visiting was taken ill it grew weak and
emaciated during the daytime it would
eat ravenously and seem to pick up
strength but every morning it would be
weak again i was frankly puzzled and
was interested in the case from a medical
viewpoint although i had never felt any
leanings toward veterinary practise but
my host merely shrugged his shoulders
and accepted the situation with spanish
fatalism also he did not seem to care to
discuss the case whenever i broached
the subject he would avoid it with a bit
of a shudder and would make the sign
of the cross most of the ranch-hands
acted the same way about the matter
finally one of the cowboys not quite so
weird tales



superstitious as the others led me to the
horse one evening and pointed out a huge
bat-vampire-bats they call them-
clinging to the horses neck sucking its
life-blood

  there has been such a bat around
yankton all summer interrupted young

crane can it be--

  let me go on with my story per-
sisted dr porter the bat fled before i
could get my hands on it i at once in-
quired why they didnt keep the bat away
but the cowboy replied it is not possible
senor for once a vampire marks its vic-
tim the victim is doomed but i myself
am not a fatalist i insisted on putting
the poor horse at once into a carefully
screened shed nevertheless the bat got
in and out and the horse continued to
fail we blocked every hole but we
could not cope with the fiendish ingenuity
of that vampire so as a last resort i
persuaded my friend the cowboy-by
means of viucho dinero-to sit up with
the horse and guard it at night to try and
shoot the bat if he got a chance

  did that work

   yes it did for a while the cowboy
didnt even see the bat again the horse
rapidly gained in strength and i was just
about to taunt the argentinos that the
vampire was not as omnipotent as they
seemed to think when one morning i
found the cowboy asleep and the horse
dead drained nearly bloodless

   but doctor objected crane if any-
thing like that were happening to mary
she would know it and there would be
marks on her throat

   are you sure that there arent marks
on her throat demanded the older man
pointedly

  n-n-no admitted crane have you
observed any

   i havent looked dr porter replied
this idea hadnt occurred to me when i
first examined her and now frankly i

weird tales

dont care to disturb her in her present
nervous condition nor for the same
reason have i mentioned bats to her
but we shall keep a careful watch from
now on

  well to be equally frank with you
sir asserted young crane i dont place
much stock in your bat theory but there
have been a great many strange carryings-
on in yankton this summer and nothing
would surprize me very much certainly
we dont yet know what is the underlying
cause of miss mortons illness

  so dr porter following out his hunch
next interviewed marys father on the
subject

  you havent seen any vampire-bats
around the house have you he asked
abruptly

  pop mortons jaw dropped for he sud-
denly remembered hermans weird
theories

  vamp-vampire what he gasped

  it was dr porters turn to become
surprized for pops confusion was clear-
ly indicative of something

  why what do you mean asked the
doctor

  nothing nothing asserted pop
much embarrassed no i havent seen
any bats at all

  and nothing more could dr porter
pump out of him except the repeated as-
sertion that he hadnt seen any bats nor
did pop mention the conversation to
herman fulton until much later

mary continued to waste away recov-
ering a bit sometimes for a week or
so at a stretch only to fall still lower the
next time that a relapse set in

  meanwhile dr cranes patients stead-
ily deserted him one by one it soon
became evident to the young doctor that
herman fulton not content with remov-
ing him from the morton case was in-
sidiously and persistently bringing to bear

the banks influence to drive him out of
town until at last the day came when the
young doctor was unable to meet a pay-
ment on the mortgage on his own estab-
lishment and was refused an extension
by the banker

  fulton then placed his cards on the
table by offering a handsome settlement
for the equity if dr crane would move
out of town and so dr crane moved

  for some time past one of the new
york hospitals had been angling for
dr cranes services and now he accepted
the offer

  herman magnanimously permitted him
to say good-bye to mary the farewell
was touching though brief not a word
was said to let the girl know that crane
was the victim of her fiances jealousy

  ive a splendid opening in new
york reported the young doctor and
so i am reluctantly leaving yankton to
take it but the real impelling reason is
that new york will give me an oppor-
tunity to read up on anemia and i hope
to find out some way of curing you if i
succeed i shall be very glad that i left
in any event please remember that i shall
always be your devoted friend please
please call on me if you ever need help

  seizing her hand he held it tightly for
a moment and then left abruptly there
were tears in the eyes of both of them

immediately on his arrival at his new
job dr crane hunted up the member
of the hospital staff who was supposed to
know the most about anemia and through
his suggestions plunged into a line of
evening reading in the medical alcove of
the new york public library

  he wrote mary morton once-merely
a brief note giving her his address and
expressing a hope that she was better

  it was not long before a solution of
marys case began to dawn on him he
found that as old dr porter had stated
weird tales

 the modem trend of opinion is that
 anemia is always secondary he found to
 his surprize that even more of the pri-
 mary causes of that disease had been
 worked out and pinned down than dr
 porter had intimated

   the enthusiastic young researcher com-
 pared each of the known features of the
 girls case-history with the ear-marks of
 each of these various primary causes one
 by one until at last he hit upon what
 seemed to him to be unquestionably the
 uniquely correct solution

   dr porter had been very nearly right
 in his surmise there was now a chance
 to save mary so ralph crane rushed off
 the following letter by special delivery

 dr jeremiah porter

 yankton pa

 my dear old friend

    i believe that i have at last hit upon the under-
 lying cause of miss mortons condition her
 symptoms her case-history and the situation at
 yankton seem to fit the specifications exactly you
 were quite right in your hunch that she is the vic-
 tim of a parasitic organism but i do riot believe
 that it is a vampire-bat

    the books describe a form of anemia very
 similar to hers and often found in mining com-
 munities it is due to a parasitic worm the
 ankylostomum duodenale which inhabits damp
 places especially underground mines

    the symptoms are very similar to those of
 pernicious anemia for which we have been treat-
 ing her that is to say successive remissions and
 relapses with the nervous symptoms very marked

    may i suggest santonin for a time in place of
 blaud

    let me know how the dear girl is

respectfully

                       ralph crane m d

   then anxiously he awaited an answer
 it came back two days later by wire

    diagnosis too late mary died monday funeral

                                     j porter

 it was already tomorrow when the
 telegram arrived announcing mary
 mortons death crane stunned and
 heartbroken by the news hailed a taxicab
 and rushed to the pennsylvania station

shhhhhhft

weird tales

only to find that there was no train which
could possibly get him to yankton in time
for the funeral so he sent some flowers
by telegraph and gave himself up to an
afternoon of bitter recrimination

  he had failed the girl he loved oh
if he had but worked faster and to more
purpose and had found out the cause of
her trouble before that knowledge was
too late to save her of course his diag-
nosis might not be correct and even if
correct it might not have enabled him to
cure her but there had been a chance
and that chance was now lost forever

  later a letter arrived from dr porter
but it didnt throw much more light on
the situation maries and blood had been
found on marys throat but the girl had
insisted that they had been due to her
scratching a particularly vexatious wood-
tick bite which she had acquired in the
mountain cabin a constant guard had
been set over her but no bat or other
animal had approached her except a
stray black cat which had jumped over her
bed on the day of her death the huge
gray bat had been seen around town occa-
sionally but not near the morton house
it all sounded rather banal and silly when
set down in blade and white on paper
but in view of the previous conference
between the twodoctors dr porter said
that he felt duty-bound to state all these
details he expressed no opinion about
the ankylostomum duodenale except to
thank dr crane for the suggestion and
to express an appreciation for the young-
er mans zeal persistency and thorough-
ness at research all of which was most
unsatisfying

  young crane was crushed stunned
and broken-hearted his mary was dead
his mary was dead

  at last he realized that what he had
mistaken for merely warm affection for

the girl had really been love oh if he
had but realized this in time

  it was his fault her death was all his
fault he ought to have asserted himself
have declared his love and have dragged
her away from yankton to new york
where she could have had adequate medi-
cal attention

  for about a week he drove his numbed
brain and weary body during working
hours his hospital duties afforded him
some measure of forgetfulness of his
grief but at night there was no relief
he walked many miles every evening
then he would lie awake in bed the
prey of bitter recrimination until at last
sleep came but not oblivion for even his
sleep was tortured by dreams of what
might have been

  and then one night about midnight
he suddenly awakened with a feeling that
there was someone in his room he was
thoroughly frightened even before he
started to awake and yet he could not
remember any dream which could be re-
sponsible for this feeling merely he
waked up already scared and with no
apparent cause

  the room was quite light from the re-
flection of an advertising sign near by
and so he could distinctly see everything
in the room by the foot of the bed there
stood a young girl clad in white smiling
down on him

  it was mary-or marys ghost but it
couldnt be her ghost for there are no
such things as ghosts so it must be mary
herself but mary was dead but she
couldnt be dead for here she was what
was she doing in new york city and
in his room and at this time of night
his mary at last could it be true

  mary he gasped

  yes ralph the figure replied it is
mary i have come to you for help be-
cause herman doesnt seem to under-
stand night after night i have tried to
weird tales



 get herman to help me but he only
 cringes and makes the sign of the cross
 and says horrid things to me which i
 dont understand he calls me undead
 of course im undead im alive as alive
 as you are but somehow he says the word
 undead as though it meant something
 else something terrible and unclean i
 cant understand him and he refuses to
 understand me but you will help me
 wont you you promised me you
 know

   of course ill help you mary dear
 he exclaimed but what are you doing
 in new york just step into my sitting-
 room for a moment until i get some
 clothes on

   she smiled wanly

   im not in new york ralph she
 replied im buried six feet deep in a
 cold dark grave in the yankton cemetery
 but im not dead im sure of that some-
 times i lie for hours in that awful padded
 coffin sometimes i sleep sometimes i
 lose my hfad and shriek and struggle in
 the darkness trying to tear the box away
 and get out and sometimes i think very
 calmly and steadily of some place usually
 hermans room until suddenly i find my-
 self there then i plead with him to help
 me but he repulses me and drives me
 back into the grave again i feel that i
 cant stand it much longer either my
 strength or my wits will give out and
 then i shall be really dead

   it was quite clear to dr crane that the
 poor girl was out of her mind she had
 probably been in a cataleptic trance had
 escaped from the coffin on the very eve
 of burial and had closed and locked the
 box perhaps even filling it with books
 so that her absence would not be noticed

 clever in such ways he remembered

 insanity so why not both it was the only
 plausible solution

  his heart went out to her in a wave of
masculine protectiveness here was a
chance for him to give to the girl he
loved the expert hospital care which she
had lacked in yankton and to restore to
her both her health and her sanity then
let herman try and get her away from
him

  as the young doctor groped in his
mind for soothing words to quiet her hys-
teria she spoke again you will help me
wont you ralph i frighten poor dear
herman so he is beginning to get pale
and anemic just like i was last night he
had another man sleeping with him and
so i cant go there any more it em-
barrasses me

  of course ill help you reassured-
dr crane now if youll just sit down
for a moment in the next room ill be
right with you

  thank you ralph said she good-
bye come quickly very quickly

  he rubbed his eyes she was no longer
there and yet he had not seen her leave
the room

  dr crane got up and dressed and
walked the streets of new york until
morning he did not dare to go to sleep
again and thus establish the possibility
that he had merely dreamed what had
just happened to him

  he was standing eagerly on the steps
of the public library when it opened at
nine oclock as the doors were unlocked
he rushed to the medical stacks where he
plunged into a new line of reading
namely cataleptic trances

  by noon a smile of grim determination
had settled over his features and he had
wired to dan callahan the yankton taxi-
driver to meet him at the limited
