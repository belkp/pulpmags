the dead man clutched the wolf by the loins
although the creature snapped fiercely at his
arms

 hark in a trice they are hushed and flown
 for morn is at hand and the cock has
 crown

 twas a gala night for the souls set free
 then hail death and equality

-danse macabre

	a voice from the dead

many years had passed since
last i had seen my old inn-
keeper friend pierre gar-
nier in far-away france

  disinclination perhaps bom of
fear perhaps mere laziness and sloth
had kept me long near home travel
ceased to beckon for as one grows
older he is ready to sit quietly by the
fire and think dwelling more in the
past than either the present or the
future

once i was cursed with itching feet
which had carried me into strange
places but now they seemed content
to rest easily in soft warm slippers


the while my fancy rebuilt old scenes
and faces in tfye glowing embers

since the news of pierres death
in far-away france which had ar-
rived simultaneously with the curious
latin work written on human skin
which i have described in the transla-
tion that was made public some
months ago i had lapsed into apathy

  pierre had been the last of my
friends some correspondence had
passed between us lately but never a
word in regard to his amazing ances-
tor wladislaw brenryk of ponkert
the werewolf whose diluted blood
coursed in garniers veins

  that was one reason why i had
never returned to the inn where
lives the man who can converse calm-
ly with son of warlock or vampire
surely i am not the man who finds
it possible and so i closed the chap-
ter as i thought and went away
but still i handled with a fearful de-
the return of the master



light the thought that once a thing of
other spaces had been so close to me
that i had hobnobbed in ignorance
with the descendant of a fiend and i
surrounded myself with weird and
occult literature of many kinds i
steeped myself in lycanthropical lore
i drowned my common sense in fan-
tastic legend myth and fable i be-
came a recluse living alone with my
books and a single servant

  one evening late in march i was
speculating idly upon the peculiar
recurrence in a -frork on philology
that i had just finished of the name
garnier grenier or gangere which
the writer had connected often with
the loup-garou or werewolf

  what a peculiar coincidence i
thought that pierres surname
should be one of these i could tell
that writer something that would
interest him much for i had not
formerly revealed pierres name in
full

  while i still smiled on the heels of
the furtive thought came a tapping
on the door and i heard parker
shuffling down the hall soon he re-
turned in his hand an envelope of
yellow

  a telegram sir he said re-
spectfully willie thoms brought
it from the town as the station agent
believed it was urgent

  very well i said extending my
hand for the message give the boy
a quarter and let me alone for i
disliked being disturbed and parker
kilv this well

  as he closed the study door i tore
open the envelope and found that
which led to the most horrid adven-
ture i had ever yet encountered in
fact or fiction it began

monsieur m-

  you will know without names who this
is from if you would aid an old friend in
the direst of peril come at once to the inn
that you know of i feel that only you
can save in gods name old friend come
at once a weeks delay may be too late

p g

  my first emotion was one of glad-
ness pierre lived and i should see
him again for the first time in
months i felt cheery but on re-
reading the cablegram which had
been relayed by wire from the ter-
minal i was struck by the agonized
tone of the message so foreign to
pierres usually placid demeanor
pierre was in danger i was needed at
once again i read a weeks de-
lay may be too late

  i rang for parker and when he
came in sight at the end of the hall
called pack my trunks at once i
leave on the morning train with-
out waiting for a reply or question i
shut the door and prepared myself
for bed

	the man on the train

it is not necessary to burden this
narrative with minute details of
the journey for it will be lengthy
enough at best suffice it then to
mention only that the ride to boston
was without event as also was the
trip to paris i chafed and fretted
spending most of the time as far in
the bow as i could place myself as
though i would be nearer to the jour-
neys end than any other i was first
down the gang-plank and in an
hours time was on the train and on
the last stage toward my goal

  it is necessary to change trains
about ten miles out of paris and
although i had a whole compartment
to myself on the first train the sec-
ond time i was not so fortunate i
ran down the platform but all the
compartments were closed signifying
that no space remained and as the
wheels commenced to turn i dis-
covered a hand that beckoned from a
door as it reached me i flung in
my grip scrambled in myself and
shut the door

  there were two occupants already
in the carriage a slender woman
gowned in black who wore a veil that


weird tales

concealed her features and a small
dapper little man about whom there
was something repellent i sensed
animosity the moment i entered and
felt a surge of dislike in return but
he smiled and nodded politely enough
in a smooth oily manner saying
slowly as though he were choosing
his words you-are-agile-mon-
sieur

  if his person was repugnant to me
more so was his voice i made some
conventional reply and pretended an
acute interest in my paper seeing
that i was not to be drawn into con-
versation he chose other methods of
amusement

  now it has always been my code to
keep strictly out of others affairs
one can not be positive what are an-
others motives in performing a cer-
tain act hidden influences are at
work upon that person that are im-
possible for us even to dream of and
interference may be not only im-
pertinent and unjust but also dan-
gerous to ourselves such it was in
this case but not wholly for although
i might have been spared some mo-
ments of mental anguish and terror
the end would have been much the
same i did not realize the true na-
ture of my foe or i should never have
left america there i should have
been safe for there is a great ex-
panse of moving water between that
land and france

  as i sat reading my paper i could
sec that the woman was restless she
was continually glancing at me as i
could tell by the movement of her
head although the heavy veil hid her
face apparently she and the little
man were companions though i re-
ceived the impression that it was not
friendship but another bond that
held them together

  the man addressed himself to her
in words so intentionally offensive
that i refuse to include them in my
narrative i half laid down my pa-

per to interfere but an imperceptible
gesture of her hand warned me that
it was none of my affair and i re-
sumed my reading but i kept close
watch of his actions

  now he attempted to seize her
hand which she allowed him to do
but as he moved nearer to her plac-
ing his knee familiarly so that it
pressed hers she shrank away as far
as she could to the end of the seat
and i felt that circumstances called
for action

  i laid down my paper rose bowed
as courteously as might be in the
swaying carriage and inquired polite-
ly is this man offending you ma-
dame

  no monsieurshe said in a low
tone he is my brother

  the little man leaped to his feet
yellow with passion

  you lie you slut he cried and
struck her in the face with his open
hand turning to me he began sir
i will thank you to mind your own
affairs but with the cowardly blow
i leapt and we rolled together on the
floor

  the woman screamed as we fought

  with amazing strength he clutched
my throat my mouth opened and
my tongue protruded strange lights
flared before my eyes and i knew
that i had met a power greater than
my own

  summoning my waning strength i
struck again and again but my hard-
est blows were nothing against  my
conqueror finally i gained my feet
face black and with a roaring as of
many waters in my ears i staggered
across the carriage blindly and fight-
ing for air crashed against the side

  faintly through the darkening
haze i saw the woman move toward
us felt cold air rush by my face as
the door swung open felt tugging at
the hands that throttled and sudden-
ly my enemy released his hold with
the last of my power i smote at the
the return of the master



little man felt his teeth pierce my
hand and backward he plunged
through the open door rebounded
once and lay quiet soon far behind

  the woman lifted the veil hesi-
tated with her face averted then
seemingly with a great effort turned
toward me and boldly looked into my
face

  i searched her features with great
disappointment when one has
plumed himself upon being gallant
and chivalrous it is indeed sad to find
that the one for whom he has fought
is neither young nor beautiful al-
though i have long passed the prime
of life still i have a keen eye for
beauty

  not long could she withstand my
gaze

  she expectantly eyed me for a mo-
ment as though most strangely i
thought i was to show some sign of
recognition but the face seamed by
wrinkles yellow and blotched was en-
tirely unfamiliar to me then she
turned and watched the flitting land-
scape that passed so swiftly by

	reginas story

t was haunted by a vague sense of
 the familiar after a bit something
so indefinite that it seemed only a
fancy something that eluded me in a
most aggravating fashion

  while i still watched the small oval
of withered cheek that i could yet
see down a wrinkle as from a dried-
up creek courses the spring floods
flowed a drop of something bright
and wet followed by another and an-
other that glittered in the fading sun-
light and i became aware that very
quietly she wept

  i touched her shoulder

  madame i said do not cry i
beg i meant only to preserve you
from annoyance surely this regret-
table occurrence was not of my mak-
ing never would i have interfered

had i thought that it was not your
wish shall i stop the train so that
we may return and search for him
and i reached for the cord

  with a strength that was ferocious
she pulled me down into my seat
again and held me there

  stop the train rather pray that
it may never stop and pray to all the
gods you know that he may be dead
or dying it is not for that i weep
could i but know that he was mashed
to pulp these would be tears of joy
she cried no my sorrow is from
another cause i can see in your face
that you know me not but i know
you well and once i was not a
stranger to you look into my face
if you will and tell me with your lips
that which your eyes already have
told me

  desperately she strained back the
loose skin on her temples and fore-
head with her palms the wrinkles
smoothed out a bit but that was all
i was though pitying her evident dis-
tress compelled to say i do not re-
member that we have ever met   

  she beat upon the window-sill with
her gloved hand then buried her
head in her arms and burst into a
storm of tears between her sobs
came broken words

 old old and i was so
young how horrible i am how
changed only eighteen and i look
a hundred once you knew me well
and i-i worshiped you i was very
young and you were kind to the little
girl that served you have you for-
gotten regina noel that waited upon
the tables at the blue falcon   

  regina i gasped scrutinizing
that haggard face indeed i had
known the little waitress but she had
been a child of thirteen when i had
last seen her and now this hag
claimed to be a young girl

  impossible i said there is
no resemblance


weird tales

  there was silence and the train
clacked on rail joint after joint
speeding by beneath us

  up she flung her head defiant
yes i was regina now i know
not what i am save that a devil has
me for its slave  

  the devil my lips shaped the
words

  	 that it is the black one the
enemy he with whom you fought
why oh why did you stop him
cant you see that it was a plot to
kill you it is a miracle that you
escaped he has planned this thing for
months to bring you into his power
and now you have defeated his plans
in the first struggle but it will not
be long he has got me and he will
have you i feel him following fast
hush my child i soothed and
patted the heaving shoulder in the
traditional clumsy manner of man
soothing his women folk   that man
is dead he will not trouble you
again  

  oh she cried it is not the
insult that troubles me i have known
far worse than that it is your dread-
ful fate that causes me to fear he
has dragged you to him over half a
world to gain his ends and you prate
over my troubles

  i do not understand i said i
came in answer to a letter from my
friend pierre asking for help  

  she looked up wofully i wrote
that message she replied can you
guess who forced me another
paroxysm of sobs racked her frail
body

  she did not resist when i put my
arm around her

  tell me about it regina i
begged i will help you

  nothing can help us now she
answered in a desolate tone we
are lost but i will tell you it was
five years ago you went away and
did not come again pierre watched

and waited but you never came and
i wished that you would return for
you were always so good to me you
remember how you would not let the
cook beat me when i spilled the
wine   

  i nodded

    so for three years we waited and
then pierre died the manner of his
passing was dreadful it came so
slowly that before we realized that he
was weaker the sickness had him
every day he moved more feebly un-
til one night he sat in his armchair
by the fire and could not get up
again we had to carry him to bed
and he never left it

 he was brave a noble one
although he knew what ailed him he
never told i think he tried to
shield us and partly he succeeded
i was the one he confided in

   regina he called and i came
i am going tonight i feel it but
before i leave you listen in yon-
der drawer is a book bring it to me 

  i did so and he said regina
you must not read this there is
meat in here too strong for you
when i am dead send it to my friend
across the sea who fears a poor old
man dying all alone write that i
loved him and wish him well but
tell him not that i died like this

  then he raised his poor feeble
hand to his throat and pulled a
bandage away

   look close girl he whispered
what do you see

   two small wounds i said
have you cut yourself

   no dear he answered be
brave and not afraid for much de-
pends on you and i can trust no one
else i am ridden by a demon every
night and this is the mark of the
vampire 

  somehow i was not afraid per-
haps i did not understand his whole
meaning and he went on
the return of the master



   tonight i am to die i feel it
plainly do not weep for me dear
i am old i have lived i shall die but
after i am dead-his voice became
stern- do you follow my instruc-
tions without fail

   i am the descendant of a man
who four hundred years ago became
a werewolf while planning revolt
against his cruel master he was be-
trayed and was forced to kill his
own wife as a warning to the other
members of the pack his baby
daughter was rescued from him and
later on all of the beasts were trapped
and killed except the leader down
the ages has his seed persisted
always menaced by the still living
vampire and out of each generation
has one been taken in payment for
the mans treachery to his master

   so it has been revealed to me
and i am the last of the line i speak
from the grave and in warning tell
my old friend that i am dead but tell
him nothing else lest he should come
hither and fall into the monsters
power

   i am going to ask a dreadful
thing for a girl to do but i know you
are brave enough to obey unquestion-
ing much braver than these fools
that work here seeing nothing but
their weekly pay 

   i am sire i said proudly

   i knew it he smiled wanly
hark you will go now write as i
have told you and mail the book and
letter at once when you return i
shall be dead go to the priest tell
him all that i have told you under
the seal of secrecy and unless he does
certain things i shall become a vam-
pire after death and shall live again
a monstrous thing you and the
priest must open the grave after i
have been buried sever my head
from my body fill my mouth nostrils
and ears with garlic upon each eye lay
a silver cross and cfrive a silver nail
through my heart then return the

earth to the grave again and upon it
pour boiling water and vinegar

   if you do this the good god will
bless you as i do but if you fail my
curse shall be upon you now go
and do as i have said

  i left the room wrote the letter
and mailed it to you with the book
unread the latin is strange to me
she admitted with a touch of uncon-
scious humor

  when i returned to report my
mission completed i entered the room
and saw that pierre was dead as he
had predicted and there was another
present sitting on the bed it was
the man you fought with and now
you know why i am here i failed in
my piomise i am a slave and you
and pierre are lost

  the monster promised me great
things saying  regina queen thou
art in name queen thou shalt be over
my loyal subjects that i shall soon
secure 

  merciful god in heaven she
cried leaping to her feet is this
the face of a queen am i in queen-
ly garb

  i pulled her down beside me go
on  i said huskily

  the inn was closed after the fu-
neral and never opened again the
master lives there with one other
and people shun the place as haunt-
ed he searched for the book but
never questioned me till you pub-
lished the story why did you do
it  why did you  how he obtained
a copy i have no idea but he has
one and in vengeance he swore your
death he has sworn to start a devil
pack with you and to add to it until
all france is humbled by him

  sire hell is loose today and
there is no hope i cabled you under
his orders and you know the rest
now if you can escape do so but
think no more of poor regina

weird tales

	pursuit

che was pale and bloodless i was
 about to speak when suddenly she
whispered hush do you hear it

  i listened but heard only the
train noises and so replied but she
impatiently gestured for silence

  she opened the door and together
we looked back nothing was in sight
but she said i feel him coming
monsieur are you armed and
then too late too late as she
pointed

  far down the track behind us flut-
tered a thing monstrously formed
growing yet more huge as it reeled
down the sky after the train in
shape it resembled a bat but one of
such tremendous size as has surely
not been seen before since man first
dragged himself out of the mud and
began to breathe air with lungs

  rapidly it overhauled the rushing
train soaring high over trees build-
ings and wires slanting down again
dipping with effortless speed along
the level lands and gaining always
gaining as it rocketed across the
fields that we were passing

  soon it paralleled our course
passed our coach and flapped on-
ward toward the head of the train

  passing around a curve the train
bent into a crescent and from our
window we could see the creature dip
toward the windows of each coach
hold the position and drop back to
the next searching for something or
someone and i did not need reginas
horror-stricken moan it is he to
inform me for whom the monster
searched

  the train straightened out and we
could no longer see ahead but down
the wind came shrill chirpings almost
too high in the scale of sound to be
heard liquidly sweet ariowy sharp
and piercing with a note of inquiry
in the pitch the stridulation came
louder and nearer and we were
seen

i felt the girl cringe against me

beneath my protecting arm her body
stiffened and muscles set rigid i
was no less afraid than she but it is
the mans part in times of stress to
hide fear from his women folk so i
patted her shoulder reassuringly and
smiled there was no mirth in the
grimace

  it was four times the size of the
fox-bat largest known of the species
that i have seen in java but in many
ways the two were similar it
possessed the same pointed muzzle
instead of the fluted nose-leaf that
makes most bats hideously alien to
ones conception of a faces appear-
ance whiskers were present on
either side of the nostrils whose flar-
ing red contrasted strangely with the
jet-black appendages

  its six-foot body was bare in spots
otherwise covered with a mangy
dirty brown hair shading to ash-gray
along its under side mud caked in
the matted fur and not yet dry
made it seem more appalling

  ten-foot membranes buffeted the
air as train and terror drove on to-
gether the whistle screamed for a
crossing and as if startled by the
sound the thing turned its head and
stared at us again

  imagine a bats head the size of
a small tub and you have its dimen-
sions picture if you can a mouth
that mowed and gibbered at us dis-
closing sharp white teeth and above
it eyes of evil in which lurked things
unutterable

  oddly there came into my mind
that perhaps this was the very bat
that had been lost in hell now newly
released with something of that un-
earthly horror lingering in its eyes
i imagined the things it must have
seen fluttering down those murky
aisles lost in the choking smoke
soiled and scorched by the lurid
flames until it beat with throbbing
wings into the free and purer air
once more with memories that noth-
ing could ever wipe away
the return of the master



  what curious things come into our
heads at the oddest times and most
peculiar places

  again the whistle shrieked and
with it mingled a most bitter wailing
from outside suddenly the winged
beast zoomed upward overshadowing
us with its mighty membranes and
blackness rushed to meet us as we
entered the tunnel i saw the creature
rise almost perpendicularly to sur-
mount the hill that we were passing
through

  regina shuddered as though re-
leased from a spell and i recalled the
power that had held the hungarian
numb in the sleigh when the were-
wolves pursued him along the river
with the thought came action
although i had felt nothing of this
paralysis i knew that i might be
next and it would be then too late
to do what i had in mind i opened
my bag garments flew over the com-
partment as i searched for my auto-
matic which i usually carry while
traveling abroad as i closed my
hand on its chill metal we burst into
the twilight the dull red sun was
cut in half by the hill we had pierced
and against its ominous glare a black
dot flickered for a second

  we waited soon we saw our pur-
suer near the carriage one gigantic
wing finger scratched the window-
pane and while its wing was raised
for another stroke and its filthy body
was clearly exposed i poured six bul-
lets into the junction of wing and
trunk

  to the music of tinkling glass and
eldritch squeaks of pain he danced in
air rose high somersaulted over and
over and thudded to earth in a lash-
ing huddle of leathery membrane

  the train rushed on i hugged the
girl beside me in ecstasy he is
gone the master is dead i cried

  no one will ever say that re-
gina replied you can not kill him
look and she drew her head back

from the broken pane with dull wo
written on her haggard face

  i stared back and far behind
bobbed a black shape like a large dog
running with a limp but following
with great speed

  over plowed fields he ran dipping
out of sight and reappearing again
farther in our wake still coming on
with the speed of the swallow

  and the sun went down

	surprizes

the night was creeping in upon us
when we left the train for
although i knew that pierre was
truly dead i dreamed that perhaps i
might avenge him how this was to
be accomplished i had no idea but i
felt certain that if the master had
gone to such labors to drag me across
half a world he would not allow me
to slip from him thus easily

  still less did i know what to guard
against for the cunning of this be-
ing was beyond my power to compre-
hend so resolving to be constantly
upon the alert i strolled down the
road toward the village apparently
at ease but instead a quivering
bundle of nerves with every sense
exploring the literal and mental
blackness before me

  regina walked at my side her
hand within the crook of my arm
although she pleaded with me to
hurry i knew it was useless if i was
to tilt with the powers of evil that
night as well in one place as another
and i fancied myself well armed

  so we slowly neared the village
suddenly regina stopped and
gripped my arm

  listen she whispered do you
hear it  he is coming  

  at first i heard nothing but soon
came a soft pattering of feet on the
other side of the hedge that grew at
the left of the road


weird tales

  i could not see clearly in the dim
light but i had the impression that
something was eyeing us through the
hedge watching carefully i saw a
dim shape bulk out from the shrub-
bery and i knew from the old manu-
script what it was

  my reading had given me knowl-
edge to cope with this emergency i
reached down and picked up two
sticks while regina cowered behind
me holding them crossed i ad-
vanced resolutely upon the thing

 oh vampire werewolf i
cried gaze upon this and fear
behold this cross and tremble here
is the lord our god who died for us
upon the tree i conjure you in the
name of the white christ to vanish
and trouble this land no more

  i confess i can not understand
what followed this incantation so
claim the books was a sure charm
and never failed to work in many
cases in which it was used but in
this case it did fail

  the beast launched himself at me
but rebounded from the hedge with a
baffled raging cry

  in that moment i knew fear still
i was thankful for my books for one
truth was holding good i knew he
could not pass the hedge

  but in my long absence what had
befallen the hedge my recollection
told me that it extended around the
field almost to the village but how
had he entered somewhere there
was a gap but if we could reach the
village before he could retrace his
steps we were safe for the night and
the next day i would enlist the
powers of holy men against this child
of hell and blast him back to whence
he came

  i did not doubt that the exorcism
was efficient but perhaps i had made
some mistake perhaps he was ar-
mored against minor spells and if so
i was defenseless so thinking i hur-
ried on life for more than myself
was at stake if i failed

  could i reach safety in time

  as we began to near the village i
searched busily through my memory
for further exorcisms and one that
the books had claimed to be of great
efficacy i determined to try

  again i paused faced the hedge
this time tracing the sign of the cross
in the air and repeated in a loud
voice

  i exorcise thee unclean spirit in
the name of jesus christ tremble

	satan enemy of the faith thou foe
of mankind who has brought death
into the world who has deprived men
of life and has rebelled against
justice thou seducer of mankind
thou root of evil thou source of
avarice discord and envy disappear
forever 

  a scream from regina and a dark
shape plunging at the hedge was the
only result of this curse and with a
frightful horror i realized the truth

  the power that fought against me
was so anciently evil so horribly un-
natuial that only otlier magic as
ancient as itself could prevail against
it either that or the god or gods
that rule us are indifferent to human
fates

  we hurried on along the muddy
road we passed slipping in the muck
of a much-traveled country highway

	heard as an undertone to our noisy
splashes three steps and a gap a re-
current rhythm that kept pace with
us on the other side of the hedge

  a stifled whine of eagerness that
held a note of furious thwarted de
sire now brought the girl near to
collapse she became a dead weight
upon me and i could go no farther

  vainly i urged the danger of our
position she could not or would not
stir the need for desperate haste
was terrible but she seemed very re-
mote and unconscious of me or her
surroundings finally i seized her
by the shoulders and shook her might-
ily crying i know not what and then
she spoke it was a very wee very
the return of the master



faint little voice and although her
sad piteously marred face was only a
few inches from mine i had to bend
nearer to hear at all

  she spoke and the words were
worlds away dont-stay some-
thing-i dont know what is hap-
pening- 

  then as she leaned against me i
felt her body stiffen she leapt away
from me her fingers widely spread
as though pushing something from
her and screamed no no ah
master-not that and then to me

 run   and with the word she be-
gan tearing frantically at her
clothing

  a glimpse i caught of snow-white
shoulders that belied that aged face
and then i turned and ran fled
stumbling through the dark slipping
and falling in the mud clawing my
way through the mire praying for a
light ahead for in my mind was
coursing a wild maddening sentence
of the long-dead brenryks story
when my body changed into a wolf
i had all the terror of a wild beast
for encumbering clothing  

  behind me-thank god it was far
behind-there shrilled a long high
keening a wailing shriek that held
within it triumph and-despair

  i had not followed that road for
years i am old the mud was cling-
ing and heavy and many times i fell
i heard no sounds across the hedge
but the silence was more menacing
than a snarl

  where was the master and upon
whal business was he absent 

  the lights of the village began to
gleam through the trees and across
the fields but as i picked myself out
of the muck again i knew that i
should never reach them for leaping
down the lane came something as
large as a collie running with a
rabbitlike lope

  i swung up my gun it spat dryly
once and was silent the beast
stopped short then came on more

slowly i dared not turn my back
so while i menaced with the empty
weapon i backed cautiously down the
road it came nearer i shouted
loudly for help which seemed to
frighten it but only for a moment

  then i recognized my surround-
ings i threw the heavy automatic
heard it thud on flesh turned and
ran for the building at the roadside

  behind me racing feet that fell
faster than the throbs of my wildly
pounding heart before me the closed
door of the deserted inn and as i
reached the step a lurching creature
charged from the side and all three
of us struck the door together

  it crashed in i was thrown on the
floor the beasts having struck each
other at an angle blocked the door-
way each struggling to be first

  i kicked the swinging door from
where i lay it slammed between
me and those slavering jaws i think
that never before in all my life had
i heard such a welcome sound as the
clicking of that latch

	a night at on inn

silence-inside the inn silence and
a haunting dread for there were
those that prowled without i held
my breath and listened there was
that odd rhythm of the injured crea-
ture three steps grouped close to-
gether a gap felt rather than heard
and again three

  a rain of light pattering footfalls
that passed like a wind about the
grounds and like the wind there were
dolorous wailing also

  interwoven into the fabric of ter-
ror these two were weaving came an-
other thread of sound a heavy
pound of unshod feet that were fall-
ing dull and lifeless upon the earth

  my breath hissed loudly through
my teeth and i lost the newer
sounds but within me i knew
although i could not say how or why
that the being that tramped leadenly
outside was beyond mortal passions


weird

tales

and the weapons that men use against
one another would not prevail against
it

  and i suspected nay was almost
certain that i knew what it was that
strode automatonlike around the inn
and who it once had been

 the two that prowled were now
three and as though this had given
them confidence they bunched to-
gether and struck the old door a
mass of fury it creaked gave but
held and round again they flew

  now curiously enough my mind
perhaps slipping away from this peril
as i have read it is like to do in
times of stress one becoming calm
and poised who before was frantic
of a sudden my thought spanned
time and space to old hadley far
across the seas in puritan new eng-
land

 i remembered how in the early
days of that struggling colony so be-
set by foes and forces a little maid in
her sleep heard tramping in the snow
outside the palisade and when awake
the march did still persist how the
fear flew like pestilence through the
fort till all were awake and heard a
steady tramp that passed and re-
passed around the building till
women sobbed in unison with the
steady thud of marching feet how
a certain holy man the reverend
abner kelton did order lights to be
brought and hadley became a blaz-
ing radiance through every window
and loophole hymns were sung and
prayers were voiced and with the
dawn came silence the people of
hadley saw that about the fort the
snow stretched like a frozen sea to the
forest unsullied by print of foot

  now i had my own opinions as to
the value of prayers against these
creatures that besieged me remem-
bering well the unexpected result of
my exorcism i had never a voice for
singing and the hymn that seemed
appropriate to the occasion was
brighten the corner where you

are i had forgotten the words to
this but i lived up to the spirit of the
title at least

  there was no sueh thing in this
village as electricity near though it
was to paris and pierre had always
depended upon oil lamps and candles
with the light of a match i searched
the gutted rooms from which every-
thing of value had been stolen and
found four stubs of candle the long-
est of which was well under two
inches and a small lamp half full of
oil with these i hoped to bridge the
night till dawn

  i felt easier at once such is the
effect of light in dispelling the unseen
terrors that haunt us all to you
that read this it will seem strange
that i thought so belatedly of lights
you may contend that the normal re-
action of a man beleaguered in sueh a
manner would be toward unhampered
vision granted but i was not
normal i was no longer a reasoning
being like yourself but a quivering
bundle of nerves most horridly
atremble at the sound of paws pad-
ding about in the night i could
hardly think two consecutive
thoughts on the same subject until
welling from the subconscious came
the half-forgotten story read so long
ago with its curious analogy to the
present

  after the lights were lit i felt more
secure and examined the fastenings
of the doors and windows the glass
was gone but there were heavy wood-
en shutters barred across the spaces
two swung opqn and the floor was
covered with dry leaves that had
blown in through the openings these
i secured noticing as i did so that in
one pile there was a hollow where
something had laired

  the place reeked with a sickening
musky odor and i felt nauseated
the rear door was rotten and the
lock that held it was rusted

  my situation was desperate for
there were no weapons nor anything
the return of the master



that could be used as such the house
had been systematically looted it was
plain and i found myself in much
the same plight as had been brenryk
the hungarian-defenseless

   but i consoled myself with the
thought that i was much better pre-
pared to cope with my enemies than
he had been was i not armed by
the knowledge of the ages what
though my exorcisms had failed in
my most desperate need the older
jand more potent lore had prevailed
and i knew with certainty that i was
safe while the light lasted it is writ-
ten in the ancient persian hymn to
ormuzd pure spirit of light that

   those that follow ahriman
      shall fear him

    those who walk with me

shall by my power conquer him

   so i waited for the dawn while the
candles flickered though the air was
very still

   there were night noises yet some
of evil portent and others that
seemed innocent the building was
full of creaking joints and small
sounds that a too eager ear might
translate as creeping things almost
ready to pounce resolved themselves
into natural noises after all

   still the pattering persisted and
that dreadful sodden pounding of
heavy feet came now from the rear
of the inn and again lumbered by the
door then came an ominous hush
and i sensed that the storm was about
to break

   a light stir overhead brought dust
sifting down from the decaying plas-
ter simultaneously with the sound
of someone walking in the room above
there was a mighty ripping crash as
the rotten door rent from its hinges
and thundered down

   over it as it crumbled into punk
limped a slavering beast and behind
it a hulking brute human in form
but expressionless and clumsy moved
woodenly through the doorway

   the dark beast came with a lurch-

ing leap but when it entered the
circle of light flinched and cried out 
throatily still it pressed forward
but i could see that every movement
gave it pain

  while it came the man behind it
moved also eyes fixed in a kind of
dumb adoration upon the master but
as he gradually slowed and stopped
not daring to enter more fully the
newcomer halted also and together
they retreated into the sheltering
night

  i was physically and mentally sick
at the sight for in that bloated evil
face brutalized by the filthiest vices
and seared with the seal of corrup-
tion i recognized the dearest friend
i had ever known pierre garnier a
living dead man

  i stepped back beside the lights
and collided with a soft warm body
behind me that moved

  my heart almost stopped i whirled
ready to fight for my life and regina
stood there bravely facing me she
was swathed in a heavy portiere from
one of the upper rooms and her piti-
ful eyes begged dumbly for protec-
tion i took her hand in mine and
together we faced the foe

	shadows all

xtow the wind through the doorway
-  flickered the candles even more
and life and death played a game
upon the wallswith shadows as their
pawns and the stake two human
souls

  it was a scene that pen can do no
more than outline a brush wielded
by one who habitually deals with
masses of color in his art might have
captured that eery moment but
words are too inflexible black and
white magic were battling light and
shadow were at war and the prize
for which they strove awaited the
outcome with no power either to fight
or flee

  shapeless forms crawled upon the


weird tales

walls darting at us but retreating to
their corners with reluctant squirm
night was welling in through the
open door darkness and all the evil
that is held within it crouched just
inside the threshold

 the master resumed his human
form again his left arm hanging
limply at his side the shoulder was
a mass of blood stiffening in the cool
breeze

  as the candles flickered horrid
phantoms hurtled across the ceiling
and close in pursuit rippling banners
rushed banners of light fiercely
intolerant of evil scattering that tat-
tered host of night the little points
of yellow waved wildly but the lamp
protected by a glass chimney burned
steady and true

  as the shadows raced upon the wall
those in the dark wavered now
edging toward us under the protec-
tion of the sable wings that were
spread over them now wincing back
from the demon-frightening light
when the wicks flared up once more

  i watched one candle-stub that was
almost gone when that dies i
thought will they rush us will
the remaining lights be strong enough
to defend

  it burned lower and more fitfully
theie was only a rim of wax like a
ring unbumed then the wick fell
into the melted wax and the flame
expired the shadows surged in and
the watchers took one step nearer
that was all

  they dared not come closer while
the light lasted but it was failing
fast and the writhing coils of night
seemed to know and ravened silently
for our lives

  we waited-what else was there to
do we could not flee elsewhere we
could not defend ourselves there was
nowhere to hide that they could not
reach us so while the frisking phan-
toms danced stealthily about us and
the dreadful prowlers leered as
bravely as might be we waited

  i looked at the girl and she smiled
back at me touching a bruise on her
cheek that was beginning to blacken
the realization was forcibly brought
home to me that this was the mark
where the gun had struck

  i pitied her but she misunderstood
my look

  do not fear me she said he
can not change me now i am resist-
ing his power and he is trying hard-
est to beat down your guard sub-
mit and he will call you to him where
he can reach you resist and we
may yet escape him  

  i fought back the growing lassitude
that was overcoming me how i
longed for rest

 sleep i was commanded
fool to pit yourself against me
rest and forget the world come to
me and i will give you rest the
wheedling voice insisted

  leadenly i stepped forward an-
other candle died and my enemy
came to meet me

  then it seemed that invisible hands
raised a barrier between us although
i pressed forward and the third
flame went out i was firmly urged
back against the wall and held there

  nothing could be seen but the air
seemed palpitant with life life that
exulted joyously in the pleasure of
existing life that pulsed with a
definite purpose that would not be
denied regina felt it and her old-
young face looked piteously into
mine and with a motion of protec-
tion i placed my arm about her
shoulders and drew her close tc me
side by side we faced the end

  the thing that had been pierre
ran its red tongue over pointed teeth
and watched us seemingly he did
not fear his brutish face held no
gleam of intelligence only unspeak-
able vice and ravenous desire were
written there and this was the
friend i had loved

  but he that had brought death and
destruction to so many that dread
the return of the master



personification of loathsome evil at
last realized what fear meant

  the oppressive feeling lessened i
felt free to move again and once
more i thought coherently a dead-
ening weight had been lifted from
my brain

  corpuscles of lambent cool flame
began to gather thickly clustering
in the room they slipped through the
shutters that barred the broken win-
dows and through the doorway one
passed through the masters body
he cringed and it lingered as though
inspecting him carefully before enter-
ing farther even through the walls
they came and watching them we
marveled at their numbers

  what can they be i whispered
to the girl

  wait she said i think i
know

  now about each nucleus of light a
mist formed like fog around a street
lamp it thickened coalesced and
bodies began to appear their gar-
ments represented all periods and
countries

  side by side near an imperious
cavalier of spain stood a gipsy wan-
derer gay in spotted neckerchief pol-
ished leather and gold coin buttons
farther away i recognized a roman
gladiator with his hand on the shoul-
der of a persian spearman whose
harness was that of alexandrian con-
quests an ugly crone with hooked
nose and protruding teeth tottered
and was supported by a chinese
bonze near them i saw the brown
of eastern faces and the green robes
held as a holy color by the moslems
and in the breast of each glowed
dimly the central fires

  it is the rising of the slaves
said regina here are those that
have suffered from the masters rule
the spirits of the dead have come to
save us oh god i thank thee
pray sire and give thanks for we
are saved

 perhaps i replied look
the last candle fails

  the shadows rushed in again but
the master and the undead beside
him did not advance they were
held in their tracks and though they
longed to flee they stood glaring at
the accusing crowd pierre stupidly
shaking his head at us

  one of this whispering company
was more opaque than the others in
the throes of some gigantic struggle
he sobbed and panted his nebulous
light growing dim as he became more
visible as his shape became more
pronounced the myriad radiant cor-
puscles waned in brilliance as though
he was draining them of force

  the red of a british soldiers uni-
form faded to pink the knights ar-
mor translucent at best became
gauzy then transparent and disap-
peared before my eyes together the
green robes of the arabs and the yel-
low of the chinese bonze vanished
and in their place was empty air

  one by one the strange throng be-
came invisible but i knew that each
was still present giving his all to his
comrade who was becoming more
tangible every second

  now more than half had gone

  the master stood in the doorway
still but there was a difference the
hunter had become the hunted as
he had frozen others in their tracks
while he worked his will upon them
so he was held in a grip from which
there was no escaping

  but he was not submitting weakly
to his former victims he was fight-
ing valiantly for his life great
beads of moisture burst out upon his
forehead as he hurled his mighty will
at the shape that grew still more
plainly human his tremendous
mental powers struggling against the
combined strength of the now wholly
invisible throng buffeted the half-
man hither and thither about the
room


weird tales

  caught first in one eddy of force
and then another he hurtled like a
wind-blown leaf and when he struck
walls or floor there was no sound he
was not yet solid

  it was a mighty scene one whose
like has never been seen before the
unbelievable and impossible was
occurring before our eyes it was no
less than revolution evil that had
triumphed since unknown times was
being overthrown and by agencies
that once were human

  i felt proud that i was man one
of the dominant race and in a surge
of power i gave my feeble mite to the
struggle since obviously it was the
masters desire that the stranger
should not become strong i willed
with all my force that he should i
like to feel that it was the added
energy i gave that tipped the scales
so evenly balanced and i hope that
it was

  suddenly without warning a man
as humanly solid as you or i stood in
the center of the room dressed he
was in harsh blue cloth about his
throat was fur and upon his head a
high hat of the same material

 with the transformation came
vibrant joy that pulsed and throbbed
through the room and i knew that
the invisible ones were rejoicing

  visibly the master aged his power
was ebbing from him and the
strength that had held back time
down through the ages was passing
the years were rushing in upon him

  now the silence was broken for the
first time since the door had been
broken in during the period of wait-
ing and through the battle of wills
nothing but the hoarse breathing of
the living corpse was to be heard but
now the room echoed to long wild
peals of eery laughter

  the stranger was giving vent to
merriment and at the sound we
shivered there were revenge and
joy and death in the cry

  then he spoke and on of the
strangest happenings of that remark-
able night occurred although he
spoke in unfamiliar language his
meaning was clear to me

  i have returned he said in a
slow icy voice do you know me
the master did not answer but i
could see that he was shaken his
body visibly shrank his hair grew
white and a tottering senile old man
stood in the doorway beside the dull
uncomprehending monster that he
had made of pierre

  before i died i prayed that i
might be given you for mine i have
waited for many years i bided my
time where i was sent to expiate my
sins others i met more sinned
against than sinning together we
have come are we known to you
a croak replied vermin of the
earth yes

  then cried the stranger pre-
pare for now you die

  the master stood more erect with
something of his old pride and might
and waited

	vengeance at last

nphen the old formula of transmu-
tation was gone through again
the actions that i was so familiar
with from the old manuscript were
repeated and i saw for the first time
a werewolf at the moment of change

  he tore off his suit of blue and
stood a very giant before us then
he fell upon all fours his limbs
withered and became long lean
shanks his hands grew claws and
became pads hair sprang out upon
his body his head narrowed mouth
widening and ears becoming pointed
his eyes were bloodshot with fury
as he howled in a long dismal tone

  he was now a beast and as i
formed the words in my mind i
recognized my savior

  wladislaw brenryk i gasped
      continued on page 
when there was a-job to be
done especially adventurous
entailing skilful diplomacy
and undoubted peril tom mansey
was summoned partly because he
knew papua as well as a white man
may partly that he seemed indiffer-
ent to probable torture and death
meted out by head-hunting savages
to intruders in hidden empires of the
hinterland

  the stout officials sat about a table
viewing evidence which had promul-
gated fresh indignation it had been
seized from the trophies of a globe-
trotting curio-hunter who parted re-
luctantly indignantly from it and
spouted wrath and threats of re-
prisal it was a mummied human
head no larger than a mans doubled
fist beautifully cured furnished with
balls of cats-eye chalcedony in the
sockets lips sewn in a kissing pout
the shocking feature was its abun-
dant and flaming red hair nowhere

in papuasia is red hair natural to a
native the idea of a mummied head
with ruddy locks threatened the
fragile foothold of white civilization
on those dark flanks of a land as
treacherous as the panther it most
resembles

  mansey added the final note of
nausea to the assemblage

  a womans head i should say
whether a white woman or not i
dont know the curing might
brown the skin this hair is silky
rather fine and waved certainly not
bleached by the manner of lip-sew-
ing i should say it comes from the
north-shore people i never saw nicer
work  

  it was uncanny horrid weird to
hear him enthuse over the craft of
cannibalistic savages but his remarks
were crisp when they asked him to
investigate the source of supply take
feasible measures to halt barter in
heads intimate to the most indom-

ghouls

the girls body hung limp in the
apes paws


weird tales

itable hellishly cunning race of
blacks that earth endures that selling
human heads to tourists was indeli-
cate inadvisable and immoral

  id suggest right here that youd
better stop tourists buying heads so
long as they pay big money for them
the heads will be forthcoming and
since heads with nordic-colored hair
bring fatter prices the natives will
swoop down on the ports and clean
out our little intrusion of white ex-
ploiters in one whirlwind of savagery
run amuck however im interested
using cats-eye quartz for eyes is a
new wrinkle that shows intelligent
progress in art

 mansey crossed the room in a
weighted silence and traced a fore-
finger on a wall-map traversing
from the curlews south of sarong
then to the great island of papua
marked on the north new guinea

 what white men or women have
gone into here in the last decade and
whos missing he asked of the
companys clerk who had said least
and done most to assist in the investi-
gation the clerk flipped pages of a
book and wrote rapidly on slips of
paper which he gave to mansey

  with these data mansey set out
with a power launch and a flock of
tonga boys in small outrigger proas
hollowed from hardwood in a manner
that has not changed since the sea
spewed forth the south sea islands
mansey was lightly armed weapons
are small insurance against the peril
of penetrating tribal villages of
treacherous papuasian black men
and he knew that where that ruddy-
haired head was cured and fitted with
quartz eves were intelligence and
barbed cunning

  he had little information on which
to base conjecture official files men-
tioned a scotchman andrew keith
who had gone native thirty years be-
fore taken to the hinterland and
never reappeared besides andrew
keith one other white man was in

that locality to which mansey was
bound his name was homer mullet
he had been a surgeon in london got
into disrepute and after a brief at-
tempt to establish himself in port
moresby went north evidently had
luck with the natives and sent down
frequently for drugs of surgical na-
ture and new cases of instruments
his latest order was not more than
six months old with this meager in-
formation on possible sources of red
hair tom mansey navigated the
treacherous tide rips and cross cur-
rents and after weeks of tentative
questioning located the lagoon where
homer mullet was reported to have
established himself as a sorcerer of
greater magic than any native chief-
tain

leaving his tonga boys and their
proas outside mansey and a na-
tive launch man entered the reef
jaws of white coral just when dawn
turned the world pearl and the sea
was shimmering opal across the
lagoon were the triangular huts
fringed with tinkling shells a fire
burning on the beach cooking pots
steaming over it and the flower-deco-
rated savages who shouted yowls of
welcome his launch churned bub-
bles in water clear as air shining like
green flame beneath were sea-gar-
dens indescribably beautiful and
menacing tinted coral waving fem
weeds wide-open flanges of tridacnas
that can take off a mans foot if he
steps into one pretty little fish clus-
tering and scattering like particles
of an exploding glass ball the air
was hot and moist perfumed by
flowers thick with the stench of rot-
ting river swamp pungent with sea-
tang themingled scents of papuas
breasts teeming with desire unfor-
gettable as the hells it transcended

  with a feeling of high adventure
mansey sent the launch close to a
crude causeway jutting between the
nipa-thatched huts knowing the
gray ghouls



yelps of painted spear-pronged sav-
ages might change at a breath to
cries of blood-lust and battle his
heart pounded with the spice of the
thing and another discovery sitting
in state near the fire remaining seat-
ed while the savages danced and
leaped in childlike frenzy was the
white man he sought

  a dozen black hands reached to
help him to the landing stage the
center of a swarm of rowdy young
warriors hideously glorious in neck-
laces of human knuckle-bones sharks
teeth crests of paradise plumes he
was led to the fire and an avenue
cleared down which he walked to the
white man who was distinctively un-
ornamented except by flower gar-
lands a collar of many strands of
pearls and pearl strings looped to
his midriff

  im tom mansey he said and
i suppose your name is homer mul-
let ive been a month or two find-
ing you to have a little talk  

  mansey commented mullet
without rising or offering his hand
seems to me ive seen your name on
the companys notations sit in for
breakfast and make yourself comfort-
able im pretty chief here and as
long as we agree you can sleep easy
theres turtle stewing and theyve
learned to cook it white-man fashion
its good to hear english again you
havent by any possibility some
recent gramophone records have-
you  

  mansey had he breakfasted on
scraped ooconut cream and turtle
stew a little fruit and remarkably
good coffee and was patient while
mullet pumped and probed him for
world news and port gossip

  he and mullet ate alone the
crowd had dispersed to a farther fire
and cooking pot the women were
invisible in the huts mansey had
opportunity to observe many things
a garden of sorts for that wilderness
an almost new lagi-lagi house for the

men and that mullets abundant hair
curled to his shoulders but was so
dark brown as to be almost black
otherwise the renegade surgeon was
a giant in stature growing too fat
and slightly insane which mansey
expected no white man can fight
papua the land gets underhis skull
and behind his eyes it drugs and
stultifies his morale and finally kills
his soul that had evidently hap-
pened to mullet but his talk was
rational mansey saw the slender
tapering fingers always playing nerv-
ously with the pearl strands and
the shifting prominent eyes he had
been a man of character and person-
ality a brainy intelligence sensual-
mouthed and his good looks spoiled
by a flattened nose and indulgence
which over-hampered his body

  youll stay a few days he
asked

  id like to mansey told him

  you can have a house anything
else mullets smile was suggestive
and mansey shook his head

  the fact is i came for your help
in halting the sale of heads to white
tourists if possible mansey told
in detail the new menace which had
leaped to formidable proportions and
of the one ruddy-haired head which
had started the rumpus

  so you knowing something of
heads said mullet recognized the
lip-sewing and came north they
know that im here and that sandy
keith left his red-headed offspring
in these hills eh

   i suspected something of the sort
i suspected you

   this man was clever also friendly
mansey wanted that amiable feeling
to continue and he had no hope of
fooling homer mullet about his mis-
sion frankness might serve where
guile would antagonize

  you flatter me said mullet
laughing i start no line of devils
down here my friend besides my
hair isnt red


weird tales

 but the heads- began man-

sey mullet silenced him

   ve no doubt my fellows do trade
heads they cure them i cant stop
that but i have managed to put the
fear o god into them enough to con-
fine their head-gathering to enemies
and killing them outright before they
begin one thing ill admit there
isnt a fresh one in the village look
at the houses

  they strolled abroad and mansey
saw that the heads on display were
old rather green and misted with
mold wooden figures carved gro-
tesquely were plentiful the village
was clean the houses new there was
evidence of sanitation and order un-
usual to natives yet instinct told
tom mansey he was hot on the trail
of trouble

  he was sure of it when at one hut
there was a commotion and he saw a
young girl struggling with older
women and caught a glimpse of a
head of glinting gold curled in
cloudy beauty then amid shrieks of
the women she was dragged inside
and hidden mullet laughed

  bleaching a new queen he ob-
served at present i am a widow-
er after a fashion that shock you
no mansey shook his head
it isnt good for man to live alone
especially in savage lands that new
queen is a beauty

    six weeks in a darkened hut
bleaches them like mellow ivory and
shes been kept from betel-chewing
or having her teeth filed making
wives to order is feasible here man-
sey old sandy keith knew that

  he is dead asked mansey
quickly

    he is dead and i inherited a lot
of his troubles along with his trained
apes sandy was quite a scientist
he was bent on learning the language
of orang-outangs and had a flock of
them i have them now nicely
trained youll see

  mansey was relieved at the conver-
sational change and puzzled the
orang-outang is a formidable simian
and he knew little about them except
that they would clear the jungle in
their vicinity of smaller monkeys and
birds on sight mullets laugh was
unpleasant yet mansey fancied it
sounded strange because laughter
was not often loosed in that place
he sensed a sinister secret behind
this bland talk of mullet and he
knew instinctively that he was being
entertained nicely to hide that secret
as well as mullets almost pathetic
joy in companionship of his own
race and kind

that night he watched a dance at
the lagi-lagi house and the ritual
of initiation of young men ripe for
manhood-the ritual that would en-
able them to take wives and heads it
was not new to mansey but he hated
the evident relish of homer mullet
over the stoicism of young men en-
during greatly he watched through
a haze of the final orgy until satiated
with strong drink and blood-lust they
finally dropped inert and lay like a
strange harvest of death as dawn
flowed over the hills and blazed on
the sea

  he went to the hut they had given
him but did not sleep the settle-
ment was lifeless at that hour except
for a few older women at their house-
keeping and cooking he thought of
the girl in the bleaching hut who
would be mullets queen and was
sorry for her needlessly he remem-
bered that mullet had said he was a
widower at present and during the
dance in the lagi-lagi house he had
confided drunken details of his rule
and the reign of sandy keith

    he lorded it mansey had sev-
eral wives and i married one of his
daughters a red-headed she-devil
she had all the beauty youd ever
find in a woman but she was worse
than native she tried to kill me a
gray ghouls



dozen times knives poison sorcery
until-

  mullet had laughed horridly tom
mansey had no doubt in the world
that the red-headed wife of homer
mullet was killed probably mur-
dered it was not his concern but it
sickened him he knew that he was
on the track of that forbidden traffic
in heads yet no nearer a solution of
the puzzle would be presented if he
tried to halt it

  that day he slept fitfully and
awoke after the noon heat to find
homer mullet astir hearing his
voice mansey looked from the hut
door and saw mullet coming down
the trail of white crushed coral fol-
lowed closely by a huge gray shape
that loped along in the way of the
great apes paws trailing at its knees
and mullet was talking to the crea-
ture which seemingly answered by
uncouth guttural sounds

  he hailed mansey   going to take
a look-see at my queen come along   

  it seemed diplomatic to go along
and mansey came down the notched
log a little on guard because of the
great ape

  sheba wont bother you said
homer mullet shes jealous of
women but not men ive got to get
her acquainted with this girl whom
by the way ive named cleo short
for cleopatra mullet enjoyed the
joke loudly and the great ape showed
her big teeth in a wide-mouthed grin
and an uncanny cackle

  shut up yelped mullet the
effect was magical the apes eyes
showed shame even grief and she
hung her head but when mansey
looked back he thought she was
snarling

  when they reached the hut where
the potential queen was being
bleached and beautified sheba the
ape suddenly darted and swung to
its roof-peak and no commands of
mullet would make her descend

  all right you jealous old she-
monk take a look-see from up there
and youll see a real beauty bring
out the girl he called to the
scrawny old woman who peeped from
the door

  on the roof sheba chattered
angrily as mullet repeated the com-
mand in native to mansey the ex-
periment seemed considerable of a
risk as the child appeared in the
hut doorway sheba showed jealousy
the girl was the prettiest mansey
had ever seen her rounded body out-
lined in scarlet stain her only cover-
ing a waist fringe of red and white
blossoms

  homer mullet glanced at her then
beckoned to the ape on the hut roof
and commanded in lurid curses
which sheba not only ignored but
chattered back her raging resent-
ment

  look here howled mullet
youll come down and behave or ill
get the whip this girl is your mas-
ter-lady hear what i say youll
treat her nicely and none of your
tricks like last time you had your
chance you she-devil and you
made hell for everybody you know
what happened to you then and itll
be woise next time ill make a croco-
dile of you-understand you know
how you hate water and the muggers
well you behave or your next in-
carnation will be a mugger now
come down and kowtow

  mansey listened in astonishment
and something of fear the she-ape
was powerful enough to tear a man
limb from limb and she was roused
to fury her eyes shot green fire her
teeth flashed and ground on them-
selves the pretty little bride was
gray-skinned with terror and dropped
to the ground her golden eyes a wild
appeal mullet had been drinking
heavily all night and was still drunk
his face grew purple-red his eyes
were bloodshot the veins on his neck
stood out and throbbed but the ape


weird tales

defied him and in the end he snarled
a command to take the girl inside
and strode off beckoning mansey to
follow to a couch by a shaded nook
at the jungle edge

  there he imbibed more fermented
coconut juice and gradually calmed
to coherency which was no less fright-
ful in its revelations than his exhibi-
tion of rage

  that ape is near human id say
she is human old keith made a
study of them i went him one bet-
ter i gave them brains you saw
that she was jealous didnt you
well im afraid of her six months
ago she killed my bride another red-
headed beauty like this one ive got
to prevent that mansey somehow
ive got to keep her from this girl

  why not do away with the ape
asked mansey more because some re-
ply was expected than as a sug-
gestion

    i dare not ive got seven of them
trained equipped with brains think-
ing brains theyre my bodyguard
without them i wouldnt last here
oh i know these blacks dont love
me im not that great a fool that
id feel safe long the she-apes are
always near you dont see them
but they dont let me out of their
sight i made a mistake with sheba
though sheba was the name of that
red-haired she-devil of a wife that
tried to do me in i remember telling
you about her last night well sheba
loved her red hair and beauty she
loved me too damn well and god
how she hates being a monkey but
that was no idle threat about the
muggers ive never tried that but
i will ill make a crocodile of
sheba so help me god if she touches
this new girl

  mullet youre about as drunk as
ive seen a man better quit that
stuff or youll be seeing monkeys
said mansey

  homer mullet laughed long and
loud

  you dont believe that eh well
i dont blame you but didnt you
hear why they did for me in lon-
don no well ill tell you i took
the brain of a boy dying with con-
sumption and transplanted it to the
head of a half-wit homicide and by
god i made a success of it and did
they hail me as the discoverer of a
new trail in surgery and see as i
saw a way to empty our asylums and
make use of incurables they did
not they said i was crazy they dis-
graced me i barely escaped an
asylum myself thats why i came
out here and kept my hand in and
ive done it time and time again
there was plenty of opportunity the
battles gave me subjects for experi-
ment and many a head is mummied
and sold whose brain is still doing ex-
cellent service in a strange body
thats what ive done

  mansey was staring at mullet the
surgeon who gloated over his own
skill it was unbelievable yet except
the wrath which shone in his eyes
mullets appearance was convincing

  but trying the ape business was
new and possibly it was immoral
sheba tried so many times to kill me
and one night when i was sleeping
she almost got me i struck in self-
defense stunned her and saw-myself
as a murderer you may think mur-
der a small thing to a man like me
it isnt ive never killed i didnt
kill then the she-ape that keith had
trained and which liked me was tear-
ing the hut to pieces when she heard
the row inside and before i could get
a gun she had snatched the body of
my insensible sheba you wont care
for details of what happened i
hadnt a weapon and i grabbed a bot-
tle of chloroform which was handy
and tried to brain the ape the bot-
tle broke and she was deluged it
gray ghouls



acts quickly on them mansey and
something seemed to crack in my
brain as i saw the unconscious ape
and the dying woman well the ape
is sheba now you know im a fool
not to kill her but its gone farther
than that with me i liked sheba
and she cared enough for me to pre-
vent my ever taking a second wife
more than that she has somehow com-
municated to the other orang-outangs
her jealous guardianship

  i cant slaughter all the apes in
the jungle and they haunt me sheba
has managed to people the land with
gray ghouls who watch me night and
day dante never conceived the hell
of torture that im living through
mansey

in the tropic heat homer mullet
shivered and sweat broke cold on
the forehead of tom mansey
through terrific repulsion over-
whelming him he found himself sorry
for the man who had made his own
hell with more ingenious cunning
than cannibal head-hunters could
have devised for him

  mansey if you could tell me a
way out id hang these pearls on
your arm an emperors ransom
mansey for a plan to rid myself of
this hell and live in peace

  mansey was silent the avalanche
of horror had come so suddenly he
could not yet grasp the thing he
assured himself it was the talk of a
maniac wildly horrible yet in spite
of reason he was convinced and
sifting through the horror was the
fact of those red-haired heads drift-
ing down to be bartered if what
mullet said should be true he was no
nearer accomplishing what he had
come to do the authorities would
not believe this tale nor could he
halt the barter and trade

  what became of the-the head-
of sheba he asked licking dry lips
with the tip of his tongue

 they stole it from me and i
had made a job of that head was
rolling drunk when i did most of it

i put eyes-

  cats-eye quartz asked man-
sey mullet nodded

  ive got it in the boat said man-
sey that was the one that caused
the trouble it was nicely finished
mullet stared at him

  for gods sake hide it mansey

perhaps sheba-

  he did not finish for swinging
down from tree branches overhead
the great she-ape stood before them

  mullet ripped out an oath and add-
ed you heard what i was saying

you-

  mansey fancied he heard the sound
of a guttural word of speech and he
leaped to his feet ready to run for
cover the ape regarded him a mo-
ment with her alert gaze then
reached a paw caught his shoulder
and flung him as if he were a child
at mullets feet

 better behave mansey com-
mented mullet   shes heard what i
said she was old keiths daughter
remember and he taught all of them
his own tongue if you speak french

now we might manage-

  he looked at mansey enquiringly
mansey shook his head

 very little i do comprehend
sauve qui peut however and it
seems appropriate to this situation
a fine chance snarled mullet
as he looked about him manseys
gaze followed that survey and again
he felt the chill of fear in the thick
tangle of lianas and jungle growth
he caught glimpses of gray shapes
watching them swinging in gro-
tesquely airy flight from tree to tree
a company of gray apes the for-
midable men of the woods known
to theworld as orang-outangs

 my harem was hissed from
mullets lips each one equipped


weird tales

with the brains of a woman i selected
as a wife sealing her doom at the

hands of this she- the epithets

he applied to sheba were unspeak-
ably vile mansey looked in appre-
hension at sheba but her eyes had
not changed expression evidently
there were a good many curses of
port dives and docks not included in
her knowledge of english in place
of anger the eyes held something of
the love-loyalty seen in the eyes of a
faithful dog for its master she
squatted beside mullet took his hand
and stroked it with her black paw
then held it to her cheek mullet
jerked it away with an expression of
disgust and the great ape whimpered
sorrowfully

  you see snarled mullet yet
we must talk how about those
gramophone records start a row
going-

  theyre in the launch said
mansey ill get them but when
he rose the ape caught his ankle
reaching wtith no apparent effort and
mansey was jerked to the ground
then throwing back her head sheba
displayed her fangs in a wide-
mouthed and mmistakable grin
mansey realized that he had walked
into a trap that only by cunning
could he escape from the dread com-
pany of gray ghouls which mullet the
surgeon loosed in that jungle now for
the first time he faced greater peril
than head-hunting savages seeking
trophies or glutting their unquench-
able blood-lust against white in-
truders

  wait said mullet then ad-
dressed the ape you savvy music
records he made a circular mo-
tion writh his hand and hummed a
scrap of tune you fetchem white
man proa longside savvy

  sheba uttered a sound from her
throat and swung in swift flight
through the trees mansey immedi-
ately scrambled to his feet and mul-
let rose but before they could take

a step there was a circle of great
apes hemming them in effectively
they made no attempt to touch either
man but formed a ring and marched
about the two prisoners in what
might have seemed a ludicrously
humorous array if it had not been
menacing and sinister

  mansey im going out with you
ive got to go god knows there isnt
any other place for me-in white set-
tlements i mean-but ill get to an-
other island they cant cross water
oh you can speak now these are
natives not even very good at beche
de mer talk its that devil of a
sheba who understands and com-
municates with the others you heard
her just now calling them usually
they dont come so close but your ar-
rival has made her suspicious no
doubt and she doesnt want to lose
me

  his laughter was mirthless and un-
canny the sound of insanity cracking
in his voice mansey did not wonder
he felt that his own reason would not
long stand the strain of this sinister
surveillance yet what reasoning
power was still uncluttered by the
impasse in which he found himself
cautioned him against attempting to
assist mullet to escape the great
ape would frustrate such an attempt
he felt sure and there was danger
in releasing a madman like mullet on
any other island he thought aware
that his face showed reluctance he
was again frank in speech

  mullet im of the opinion that
you cant get away and i must i
could bring help perhaps ill give
you my word to do what i can but
for two of us to attempt escape
especially when you have such de-
voted followers is utterly futile

  look here dont you fancy for a
moment you and that launch will
leave this lagoon without me man-
sey you cant you know unless i am
willing even if you got to the launch
the blacks in their canoes would
gray ghouls



halt you at the reef entrance ive
had enough of this before you came
i was making the best of it i was
content enough only that i wanted a
woman oh its my own doings
dont think im shifting the blame
but at that it was something stronger
than my will driving my hand to that
delicate operation if theyd let me
alone in london if theyd seen the
marvel of what id accomplished the
greatest feat of surgery in this or any
other age i wouldnt be here and this
wouldnt have happened but they
drove me out my own race and kind
and you belong to them mansey
ive got a grudge not against you
but all white men mansey-his
voice became quieter more confiden-
tial in tone-what if wed take
sheba you and i and tour a few
countries exhibiting the greatest
marvel of the age wed need
money and wed make it ive lorded
it here i couldnt go back and
grub and sweat again but we could
do that-

  mullet either you talk rational
or-

 what will you do what can
you do except put a bullet through
me and youd loose a hell-fury that
would tear you bit by bit in rags
ive seen sheba do that finger by
finger mansey toe by toe handfuls
of hair eyelids--

  shut up you beast cried man-
sey

   that gets you eh  well its true
and im your only protection
youve got to save me to escape
alive  

  what about the natives

  sheba is half native remember
and she likes her own kind theyre
safe theyre not only safe but in-
vulnerable when they go forth to
take wives and heads the gray apes
go along and fight for them its a

shambles when they leave mansey
it has one kick-back though mul-
let laughed again and mansey liked
his curses better than his laughter
the natives dont need to fight and
they will in time lose their own in-
itiative their courage some day
this tribe wont exist but that wont
come in time to save us

  listen mullet suppose i go out
and bring help a revenue cruiser
that will blast this village into noth-
ingness as has been done before now

a few shells-

    shells  wont reach the apes
youd merely murder the blacks who
arent to blame besides ive no as-
surance that youd come back or
send them whod believe your story
of human apes and where would i
be when they shelled the village if
i went to the hills the apes would go
along if i stayed here to have them
killed id get it what dont you
see i couldnt even kill myself if i
felt like heroics to save you because
youd have sheba on your neck the
minute i croaked pretty little mess
eh mansey and there is no escape
in the jungles or huts none at all
except to cross the water where the
apes cant follow and youre handi-
caped there because the natives know
just what would happen to them if
im not here to keep sheba pacified
i did try getting away with one of
my brides in a canoe and sheba was
on watch that night she tore a
lagi-lagi to bits jerked the men to the
shore and sent them after me in
canoes then they gave me to under-
stand i must not try again to escape
oh its a beautiful entanglement
heres sheba

the great ape dropped from over-
hanging tree branches and in one
arm she carried manseys gramo-
phone case without which he never
traveled it was further proof of the


weird tales

uncanny intelligence of sheba that
she had understood mullets com-
mand and brought the case she
squatted and deftly unfastened the
buckles of leather straps binding the
oil-cloth cover fitted the handle
opened a package of records and
wound the machine in another mo-
ment the wail of shes my baby doll
rose in the hot silence an instant
later mansey shrieked laughter of
hysteric abandon for the great she-
ape was swaying from one foot to an-
other and gazing at homer mullet
with the amorous leer of a love-sick
crone she put out a paw to take his
hand but mullet jerked it aside and
kicked his bare foot at her chest
lacking his hand to fondle she seized
his foot precipitated him on his back
and cuddled the foot to her breast
laying her cheek against it and fond-
ling each toe as mothers the world
over play with toes of their babies

  laugh damn you growled mul-
let ill show you he spoke in
native to sheba who reluctantly re-
leased his foot caught mansey in her
arms and despite his struggles
swung to the tree branches for all
her strength the weight of a fighting
man cumbered her movements and
she halted her flight to hold him by
both arms and shake him until
his teeth rattled then swinging
farther aloft she flung him over
the crotch of a branch and dropped
to earth

 from below mansey heard mul-
lets shrieks of mirth at that eleva-
tion he could see the village huts the
lagoon and his launch the long reef-
jaws and ascending far down the
outer beach the smokes of fires where
his tonga boys cooked their meal
about him were the palms glittering
like sabers in the sun but the jungle
was silent bereft of the gorgeous
birds of paradise the lorries and par-
rakeets the little chattering harmless

monkeys where the great apes held
court no other jungle life lingered

 mansey straddled the limb and
considered in frantic dismay the sit-
uation in which he was placed re-
luctantly he accepted mullets logic
there seemed no escape watching
glimpses he obtained of the lagoon
through swaying palms and branch
plumes he saw a dark object floating
and realized with his heart racing
that it was the body of his native left
in charge of the boat evidently he
had angered sheba and she had killed
him without so much as an outcry
mansey almost envied the dead man
for the first time in his years of
papua he admitted that there were
worse things than murder far worse
than the taking and curing of human
heads as trade to tourists was the fit-
ting of beast craniums with the brains
of thinking humans

  mansey looked below the gramo-
phone still wailed its jazz music and
foolish songs the seven great she-
apes were dancing clumsily in con-
trast to their lithe grace in the trees
mullet lay prone on the mats his
naked trunk crisscrossed by strings
of pearls his arms over his eyes
above mansey racked his brain to
think of a plan of escape far off the
black crouching hills quivered in the
heat which was affecting mansey in
spite of a breeze at that elevation
which did not penetrate below he
felt thirsty and faint and he knew if
he should lose his grip of the tree
bole he would fall to death his
heart and blood began to pound a
throbbing which presently drummed
in his ears then suddenly tom
mansey knew he heard drums far off
faint inaudible to mullet because of
the grinding gramophone diligently
kept going by sheba

  mansey knew the meaning of the
drum-song of papua rising falling
sinister maddening the voice coaxed
by bare hands from bladderskins
gray ghouls



stretched over human skulls and a
new fear swooped and rode his
shoulders that drum-song meant
savages on the march and it was
coming nearer he looked below and
saw that the she-apes had ceased
dancing and stood as if listening
through the blatant jazz music to the
voice of approaching peril

  in another moment sheba had
clutched mullet and shot him to his
feet and was chattering a warning
the gramophone record died with a
moan and the drum-song rose insist-
ent as the drone of bees palpitant as
the quivering hills it roused sleep-
ing natives and the huts belched sav-
ages they poured from the lagi-lagi
where they had been sleeping off
the night potations arranging their
plume crests as they leaped to earth
young men greedy for battle eager
for slaughter grimly meticulous over
their gaudy ornaments proud of the
fine blue lace of tattooing and blis-
tered cicatrices obtained in agony

  mullet looked up to where mansey
was hidden in the tree

  need help to get down he
called sheba wall fetch you

  mansey yelled a refusal and began
to scramble down but the great ape
swung aloft before he had compassed
more than a few feet of the descent
she caught the branch on which he
was perched and bent it double
plucked him from his vantage and let
the branch go the crash as it flew
back proved the tremendous strength
of the beast-woman and manseys
heart missed a beat as he was swung
in flying leaps and dropped on the
mats unhurt

  hear those drums began mul-
let that means reprisal now
sheba and her sisters can help my
fellows defend the village he
looked at mansey and in the blood-
shot eyes of mullet there was a mean-
ing mansey tried to read because
neither dared utter his thoughts in

the uncanny hearing of sheba mul-
let turned to the ape

  good sheba pretty sheba go
after the drums sheba show the
kauloo warriors they cant fight our
fellows take the other girls and
have a good fight old girl he
patted her shoulder and at that care-
less caress the great ape fawned on
him like a grateful cur that has
known only kicks and abus

the warriors were dressing for
battle in frenzied haste they
scorned to go forth to fight or die in
aught but gorgeous array and a
drum-song of their own arose one
drum after another purling the
blood-rousing tempo that stirs the
heart and soul of a man tingles in
his flesh prickles on his scalp the
primal quickening call to war look-
ing at mullet tom mansey saw hope
born in his eyes and thought he
understood they would be rid of
the apes for a time his own thoughts
darted to the launch in the lagoon
the tonga flotilla on the beach out-
side then as he looked seaward
mansey cursed the tonga boys had
heard that drum-song and understood
its meaning they had no courage
they had launched their canoes
which ranged like slim dark beetles
on the sun-glitter of the sea ready to
dart like arrows to safety far beyond
they hovered about the lagoon en-
trahce evidently waiting a hail or
sign from mansey and he was power-
less to reach them

  about the cooking fire replenished
by old men began the war dance and
old women fetched gourds of fer-
mented coconut wine which was
swigged by the warriors who smacked
their lips loudly and leaped into new
frenzy wild contortions a hideous
carmagnole in which the she-apes
joined sometimes jumping to catch a
tree branch and swing madly spin-
ning in midair like gibbet-fruit then
at a sign from the leader the dancers

filed into the jungle and the great
apes leaped to the trees where had
been a ferocious swarm of painted
savages was only the scattered fire
embers and the women gathering the
empty gourds

  now said mullet now is our
chance weve got the luck of fools
get to the launch and start it man-
sey and ill get the girl by god
id have given sheba credit for more
brains than she showed this time but
the gods are with us

    look here you leave that girl be-
hind mullet manseys voice was
stern

  to be killed by the she-ape
what d you take me for  not much
i know whatll happen to every living
human left in this village when sheba
comes home and finds me gone
there wont be a village there
wont be anything mansey but rub-
bish blood-soaked earth and bits of
flesh that girl comes and theres
no time to argue  

  it was the one outstanding fact
they must hasten and get away
mansey turned and ran to the land-
ing stage where he had been swung
from the launch yesterday he
shortened her painter dropped in
and whirled the wheel then his
heart sank the engine was dead and
a glance showed him the cunning of
sheba for she had unscrewed every
nut and bolt she could find and
emptied his spare gasoline the cans
glittered at the bottom of the lagoon
when mansey looked overside the
ape had taken time to sink them sink
every spare tool and all loose gear
she could find she had even thrust
the oars carried for emergency into
the open jaws of tridacnas which
closed on them he leaned over and
reaching into the water wrenched on
one but not all his strength released
it his efforts broke the blade tip
and the maimed oar came up in his
hands the second one was beyond
his reach

  some minutes had elapsed in his
cursory examination of the launch
but his brain was never so alert be-
fore he thought he might use the
maimed oar to scull the unwieldy
craft and stood up to summon the
tonga proas from beyond the reef
for the old men and women of the
village were watching him covertly
and muttering among themselves
mansey remembered they did not
want mullet to escape for fear of the
great apes wrath but they would
probably not interfere with him he
faced a decisipn of saving his own life
and leaving mullet to a hell he had
made for himself or risking death in
the attempt to release mullet from
horror the choice was wrenched
from him when he saw mullet leap
from the bleaching hut to the ground
with the girl on his shoulder and
mullets free hand clutched a big
navy revolver

  mansey saw the reason for the gun
at once and his own small auto-
matics were in his hands for when
they saw their erstwhile white master
running like a deer for the shore
there was a piercing scream from the
natives left behind the war party
and they rushed at mullet and the
girl determined to hold him on his
perilous throne

  mansey heard the mans warning
cry then the crack of his gun as he
cleared a path shooting as he ran
crashing through the outthrust arms
that would have detained him leav-
ing dead and dying in his wake he
had almost gained the white strip of
coral beach from which the landing
stage jutted over the lagoon water
when one courageous old man threw
himself headlong and mullet tripped
and crashed to earth the girl flung
from his arms and curled in a heap
on the coral in another moment
mullet was the center of a heaving
lunging mass of blacks who tried to
weight him to earth
gray ghouls



  mansey in the launch heard his
fists thud on flesh heard the thud of
the gun-butt used as a club saw
black and white arms threshing like
flails then with a mighty heave mul-
let was free a triumphant yell
burst from his throat and he had
leaped toward the shining head of the
girl who lay on the sand as she had
fallen evidently knocked uncon-
scious that yell died in mullets
throat and manseys heart missed a
beat then raced painfully for
from the quivering plumes of trees
dropped a gray ghoul shape scream-
ing horribly in rage and she flung
herself at the white man and sent
him spinning with a sweep of her
long arm it was sheba

  with his brain in a whirl mansey
realized that if he was ever to get
away it was the crucial moment
yet loosing the launch painter he
hesitated mullet lay prone on the
glistening coral sand and after a
glance at him sheba had turned to
the girl whose shining brush of curls
turned slightly as if consciousness
was just returning one awful scream
burst from her throat as the hand of
sheba encircled her throat then man-
sey saw her bright hair through a
red mist for he realized what was
going to happen and saw from his
eye corners that mullet had rolled to
his belly on the coral and was tak-
ing aim with his gun manseys
thoughts darted in wild speculation
mullet would shoot sheba and he
need not aim for the girl unless mul-
let missed the ape otherwise-he
shuddered with horror of what would
happen in another moment as the
hammer of mullets gun clicked use-
lessly and sheba snarling horribly
picked up the girl as if she were a rag
doll

  manseys gun cracked twice he
felt sick revolting with nausea for
the girls body hung limp in the apes
paws and on her golden skin two
bright soft ribbons spurted and

flowed she was beyond pain but
mullet was creeping soundlessly cau-
tiously on his belly over the coral
making for the landing stage

mansey loosed the painter held
the launch by his clutch of the
neaiest post kept his gun aimed at
the head of sheba trying in spite of
the red mist over his sight to point
for the base of her brain afraid to
risk a shot lest he should miss and she
would be upon them with lightning
speed

  he had time to think how marvel-
ously the rapid-fire passing of events
had shaped for this get-away with-
out the sudden arrival of sheba the
natives would have prevented their
escape and if mansey had not in-
sisted on bringing the girl shebas
attention would never have been dis-
tracted by this opportunity to glut
jealous rage on her rival in the affec-
tions of mullet the great ape was
extremely dreadfully engrossed
mansey tried not to see what she did
tried to believe it was a rag doll in
the hands of a mischievous pet he
was bracing himself with all his will
to override the violent upheaval that
swept to his eyes and brain while
mullet crept toward the launch

  far off the drum-song was muffled
like the croon of surf on coral be-
yond the reef his tonga boys waited
another two minutes and mullet
would tumble inlo the craft already
mansey had braced the broken oar-
tip against the planks to shove out
they must widen the water between
themselves and sheba mansey won-
dered in a vague darting thought if
orang-outangs could not swim and
remembered that before this trans-
elementation the human body of
sheba was probably adept and strong
in the water

  mullet was on the landing stage
mansey heard the planks creak but
sheba seemed to hear nothing but her

tales

own animal snarling at the dreadful
task presented her she was almost
finished her arm swept out and
held aloft something pitiful with long
bright hair which she played with
and stroked then from far out be-
yond the reef one of manseys boys
hailed his master manseys whole
body jerked as if his jierves were
strings of a puppet snatched by a
crude hand

     marster marster  

  mullet lunged as sheba was on her
feet the launch careened crazily
as he plunged in and mansey heaved
on the oar then tried to propel the
craft from the stern one wild
screech of baffled rage rang and
echoed between the jungle-clad reef-
prongs and swinging the head by its
long hair sheba sailed through the
air flung herself- from the landing
stage into the water and swam after
the boat

  mullet was yelling and chattering
like a madman his gun was gone
and he had seized manseys auto-
matics and sent a sharp fusillade at
the swimming ape if sheba was hit
the lead pellets did not halt her
mansey sculling frantically at the
stern saw her fangs bared heard her
snarls stared in horror as his muscles
cracked with the strain of propelling
the tubby launch at the long gray
hairy ghoul which gained on them so
rapidly that the boat might have been
anchored for all headway they seemed
to make

  a mighty lunge and shebas paw
caught the stern seized the oar with
which he tried to batter her off and
wrenched it from his grasp then
mansey threw himself on the comb-
ing as the apes weight almost
swamped them mullet was scream-
ing fighting kicking as the paws
seized him dragged him from his
clutch of the planks and hauled him
still struggling into the sea

  for a moment there was a wild up-
heaval and the clear lagoon water

churned in foam that was blood-
streaked mullets shots had hit the
she-ape but that great body had the
strength and endurance of an el-
ephant yet in another moment
mansey saw that sheba was badly
wounded for her lips dripped redly
and her eyes showed glassy

  mullet was clasped in one arm and
she tried to swim with the other
beside the body of mullet trailed a
head with bright hair and mansey
helpless to avert further tragedy
sick with the shock of dread clung to
the launch combing watching sheba
suddenly cease swimming and sink
beneath the lagoon water with mullet
in her grasp

  the ripples spread in rings the
bubbles broke through water clear
as air mansey saw the gray ghoul
go down feet first with the white
man still struggling futilely then
as the hairy gray shape parted sea-
fern fronds until her foot touched
a vantage by which she might have
shot her body to the surface there
was a further commotion in the sea-
gardens a violent upheaval writhing
below a line of bubbles ascending
breaking soundlessly as the souls of
man and she-ape escaped

  mansey stared he knew shebas
foot had touched the tinted flesh
flanges of a giant tridacna and it had
closed like a steel trap not even in
the death agony had she released her
embrace of the man whom in human
shape she had loved so fiercely that
she took him with her to a transele-
mentation far removed from reach of
those bunglers who trifle with the
doors of life and death

the hot sun blazed down on a man
inert limp as a rag lying on the
launch bottom and presently the
tonga boys who saw the launch put
out came to investigate

  they were some weeks towing the
      continued on page 
ihs impossible

then came a blinding flash of
light an odor of burning parch-
ment

     entlemen you of the
wanderlust club are my
friends among you are
numbered financial wizards men of
scientific renown not only because
of your worldly standing but also
because of our mutual regard i have
come to you to obtain assistance in
freeing the world from the grasp of
that monster-octopus fear

  to say that we of the club were
startled is putting it all too mildly
travis the man who had just spoken
had been absent from the country for
moie than four years and now evi-
dently laboring under a terrific
strain he had returned to startle us

  some there were of us i am afraid
who thought our friend was unbal-
anced but travis waved us to seat
ourselves and calmly called out to the
attendant to lock the doors securely

  my friends he began sweeping
the semicircle of faces about him with
eyes glittering strangely several

years ago i left you to go on a ram-
bling tour of the world in haiti that
breeding place of wizardry and black
magic i chanced to see a little more
than an outsider usually witnesses of
the clutching grasp those necroman-
cers have upon the fear-bound
natives perhaps many of you will
remember that i have ever been ag-
nostic concerning spiritualism at any
rate upon seeing the damnable hold
those magi have obtained upon the
throats of the ignorant natives my
heart was filled with a great pity for
them and after many days and
nights of mulling the horror of it over
in my mind i came to the determi-
nation to throw off the yoke from the
necks of the ignorant-if possible

                                   


weird

tales

  some there are who believe that
love-or hate-is the strongest of
human emotions yet i think you will
agree with me that fear is beyond
cavil the most soul-stirring emotion
of them all my life was worth noth-
ing to anyone save myself and i
reasoned that if it were possible for
me to learn the secrets of black magic
and spiritualism by broadcasting
throughout the world an explanation
of how the seemingly impossible
tricks of wizardry were done i might
remove that fear of the unknown
from the hearts of all

  i remember thinking as i started
upon my strange quest for knowledge
of the mysterious that if i were to
accomplish my ends i must needs
learn to perform the impossible but
gentlemen the impossible has never
been done it is quite true that we
poor mortals witness some certain
thing which is beyond our compre-
hension and we dub it magic i
might he added dryly call your
attention to noah websters defini-
tion of the word impossible

  whether or not the man were mad
at least he seemed sure of himself
and we of the wanderlust club were
giving him strict attention striding
through our midst travis went to the
window and took up a potted plant
he placed it on the floor at his feet

  not with an intention of being
theatrical gentlemen but merely to
show you that i am not taking up
your time with a drooling bit of
idiocy i shall show you a few things
sometimes performed by magi for
instance look carefully upon this
plant it is thoroughly healthy and
its flowers very sweet 

  our eyes fell to the thing and as
god is my witness the plant shriv-
eled and died beneath our gaze

  travis was smiling you have
witnessed the impossible no no
gentlemen you have seen this thing
and therefore it can not have been
impossible are there things impos-

sible indeed yes but rest assured
that you shall never see them

  a man goes to a mystic a witch
a medium he sees and hears things
which appear to be supernatural his
wits are befuddled there is an inde-
finable fear in his breast and he
imagines more than he sees or hears
he credits to spirits the mystery of
the revelations which have been made
to him as for myself i have seen
things in my search for the solution
of the riddle of the universe which
i would not have thought to be pos-
sible yet i have solved the mystery
and tonight i shall show you some
of these things

  as children you witnessed the
magician upon the stage as he pro-
duced rabbits and geese and eggs and
miles upon miles of ribbon from an
ordinary hat and you were indeed
witnessing childs play the adult
mind broadened in scope of knowl-
edge demands deeper mysteries to-
night you shall see them gathered
from haiti egypt india and china
my reason in thus displaying these
mysteries before proceeding farther
with my astounding revelations i
want each of you to see for himself
for seeing is believing

travis paused for breath then pro-
ceeded with his novel and weird
demonstration trick after trick
things which i would have staked my
life upon as being impossible start-
ling shaking us all to the very foun-
dations of our souls

  in the tense moments of the de-
nouement of a rather bewildering bit
of magic amos green sipped- at a
glass of water the attendant had just
handed him

  i am tremendously sorry called
travis for the water you are drink-
ing amos is a virulent poison

  we were all startled but amos
grinning sheepishly in a gesture of
foolish bravado drained the glass
the impossible



  great god came from the lips
of the onlookers as the limp body of
amos green sagged and slipped for-
ward on the floor with a soft thud

  broome-broome  

  but dr broome was already kneel-
ing beside the still prostrate form

 dead he whispered in an
awed voice travis you must in-
deed have eaten of the fruit of the
tree of life and death   then his
voice ringing with fury i thought
at first you wtere joking-that you
might have connived with green-
but the man is a corpse  

  a shiver creeping flesh sudden
chills seized upon me i wanted to
rush from the room felt an impulse
to scream yet something seemed to
hold me fast in my chair and stilled
the shriek unborn upon my cold lips

  pardon me doctor said travis
  please make no mistake you have
tested the body for signs of life
broome drew himself up i think
that there can be no reflection upon
my professional conduct sir would
that i were mistaken  i have ap-
plied every known means of ascer-
taining life and it is an unquestion-
able fact that the man is dead a
corpse there is no respiration no
action of the heart lungs or other
organs the man is dead 

  please do not think that i wish to
discredit you doctor but will you
stake your professional reputation
upon your statement that amos
green is without life
unhesitatingly came broomes an-
swer absolutely

  our attention had been centered
upon travis and the doctor the
former pointed out then may i
call your attention to the presumed
corpse

  we turned-to see amos green in
the act of rising to his feet the
muscles of his throat were contract-
ing as though he were but taking up
the thread of life at the very point at

which he had left it he was swal-
lowing that last sip of water

  broome poor soul felt his way to
a chair and sank into it consterna-
tion written upon his features while
amos dazed and uncomprehending
stared queerly at travis

 once again commented the
wanderer i have proved that the
impossible can not be done oh i
realize that it appeared to be such
but consider well dr broome-to
whom i now extend my apologies for
my seeming discourtesy-declared
amos to be dead the question in
your minds is was he really dead
i shall permit you to answer that
question for yourselves but accept-
ing the doctors statement we shall
assume that green was in fact with-
out life i killed him and then i
brought him back to life he now
lives none the worse for his brief so-
journ in that outer world about
which we mortals know nothing
but the point i wish to stress is this
assuming that i did kill him and as-
suming that i did bring him to life
again then as you have seen this
with your own eyes it can not have
been an impossibility there is no
such thing as doing the impossible

  you lie came a strange small
voice from behind the semicircle of
chairs about travis

lye whirled-and saw a small
 v slender withered ancient-look-
ing old chinaman how he had got-
ten entrance to the room god alone
knows for the doors had been locked
and members of the club had been
seated in each of the large windows
which looked out upon the teeming
streets below no man had seen the
chinaman enter

  and i repeat the ancient spoke
again that you lie the impossible
has been done-and shall be done
again 

  senses whirling uncomprehending
i turned back to face travis and


weird tales

surely if ever one man saw another
undergo a living hell then i wit-
nessed all the torture of devilish in-
genuity being concentrated upon the
soul of the man i knew as travis

  there is a legend that his soul hav-
ing been so great lincolns body
shrank in dimension upon that sours
departure and now before my very
eyes i saw the body of my friend
shrink and i knew that his soul had
left him that it had gone out into
the ether to combat that of the china-
man here in this room a tremen-
dous battle of will-power was raging

  i saw great beads of sweet break
out on travis forehead his eyes
were wide staring then with a little
jerking of his flesh he was himself
again

  you are too much for me i ad-
mit he smiled

  the chinaman seemed to pity him

  think you that the pupil may teach
the master he asked quietly

  instantly i knew that it had been
from this wrinkled old chinaman
that travis had learned a great part
of what he knew of magic but why
had the chinaman followed him so
mysteriously into these rooms had

my friend- my thoughts were

running wild

  i might choose no better time
than this to explain the situation
travis was saying calmly per-
haps some of you gentlemen have
been wondering just what my object
was in displaying the magic i have
learned if you will be patient a mo-
ment i shall satisfy your curiosity

  you my friends and myriad
hosts of human beings in every coun-
try and clime have been and but
for me always would be subject to
the age-old superstition that spirits
communicate with the living and that
with the aid and assistance of these
spirits certain persons are able to
accomplish supernatural acts as for
myself i believe in god and there
my belief ceases i do not believe

that spirits help or restrain us for
we are free agents

  four years ago i commenced a
world-wide search for knowledge of
black magic-supernaturalism-spir-
itualism-call it what you will i
started with the assumption that
while there is such a thing as the im-
possible it had never been done and
gentlemen i have proved my case

  call back your bible-study days
recall the days of moses picture him
among the priests of egypt before
pharaoh moses sent plagues upon
the egyptians-and the magicians
duplicated his miracles now if as
the bible states-and i believe it to
be true-god lent power to moses to
perform these miracles then who lent
power to the necromancers of egypt 
there gentlemen is a question my
answer-and the only logical re-
joinder so it seems to me-is that
the priests of egypt used trickery

 i have shown you who are
gathered here some few things which
you could not understand things
which bewildered you frightened
you and yet i have devoted but four
years to the study of magic you
men of scientific renown men of
hard-headed business acumen have
known fear this night consider what
groveling fear you might have felt
had you been of the masses or of less-
er intelligence suppose i had been
born among magi suckled and nour-
ished in an atmosphere of intrigue
and mysticism do you doubt that
i might now perform even more
wondrous deeds

  and yet they would all have been
deeds of trickery of these things
which you have seen and of their
explanations i shall speak further at
a later time for i see that my es-
teemed visitor is becoming uneasy

  some small satisfaction i shall
permit him by publicly admitting
that i am a thief calmly as a
ripple of disbelief swept over us
travis thrust his hand into an inner
the impossible



pocket of his coat and withdrew a
small stained tattered ancient-ap-
pearing book i have here a chron-
icle of-but wait i must begin at
the beginning

  it is well known that the magi-
cians and priests of the various east-
ern cults have kept knowledge of
magic alive by handing that wisdom
down from father to son you might
torture or kill but the priests died
with their secrets of necromancy
locked in their breasts only to their
sons or successors would they impart
their learning and down through
the ages the peoples of the earth
have been as dust beneath the feet of
the sorcerers bound to them by a
chain of fear hitherto unbreakable
it is my purpose to break that chain

  and now a moment of my his-
tory for the four years just past a
few months here several there ap-
plying myself diligently and with
the aid of unlimited funds judicious-
ly spent i passed from one sorcerer
to another learning what each had
to impart no need for me to go into
intricate details-time forbids let
it suffice that at last a year ago i had
seemingly reached my goal i could
duplicate all the bags of tricks dis-
played by magicians of egypt india
china and yet i knew that some-
where there must be a source of
knowledge i think that it cost me a
part of my soul but i found that
source

  this man-pointing to the stol-
id old chinaman-lived in a hovel
near a temple far from the haunts of
man how i found him god alone
knows but i did find him and by
throwing myself whole-heartedly into
a living lie i causcd him to believe
me a sincere and devout mem-
ber of his cult and this little
wrinkled old man held in the hollow
of his hand all the secrets of eternity

  remember please that the knowl-
edge possessed by the ordinary magi-
cian or priest is but a very small

part of a great whole knowing com-
paratively little he has but little to
impart to his son or successor so
great are the secrets combined that
no man could ever hope to master
one tenth part of them and so per-
force they must be written this
book-holding aloft the stained and
tattered parchment-holds within
its covers the answer to every mys-
tery of the universe i stole it from
this chinaman-for all humanity i
beqame a thief

  and now you know why i have
come to you with these astounding
revelations now you comprehend
why i have performed these acts of
magic tonight i know that i have
convinced you that i am telling the
truth and together we shall bend
every effort lend every aid to broad-
cast to the world these logical and
simple explanations of hitherto in-
explicable mysteries of the super-
natural and when we shall have
informed the world of the insidious
evil of the magi then we shall have
removed for all time the clutching
clawing grasp of fear from the hearts
of those who know no better than to
give credence to the supernatural  

exhausted by the force of his
fierce passion travis smiled tri-
umphantly at the chinaman this
sorcerers presence sirs can mean
but one thing he has trailed me
over thousands of miles intent upon
regaining possession of this book for
exposure of its contents will wreak
incalculable ruin to the carefully
nurtured age-old belief well-
smiling into the chinamans eyes-
he shall not have it

  the chinaman made no remon-
strance he remained still and silent
as a carven statue

  travis thrust out the book so that
the chinamans eyes might fall upon
it peimit me to point out to you
he said that while i did not suc-
ceed in overpowering your will a


weird tales

few minutes past yet at the same
time you found to your sorrow that
you could not conquer my own
checkmate physically you are un-
able to overcome me and you know
quite well that sorcerer though you
are i can thwart your magic with
other magic equally as powerful
therefore i shall keep the book  
now for the first time the china-
man moved there was something
sinister about his sinuous gliding mo-
tion and i felt a premonition of im-
pending evil terror horror

  the chinaman halted spoke swift-
ly   one thing you forget you have
not yet mastered all the secrets-you
are a fool i know a thousandfold
more than you can you hope to re-
sist the accumulated knowledge of
eons of time

  i perceived a sardonic twitching at
travis mouth

  i read your thoughts-you should
have guarded them more carefully
this was travis answer to the
chinaman you are thinking that
this book is written in the very oldest
form of written language and that
you alone possess the key whereby the
writings become legible and in-
telligible but you are wrong in
your assumption travis voice
rang shrilly in my ears as he turned
from the chinaman to us who were
his friends you may not believe
me when i tell you this thing but
that man does not understand one
word of english and he has been
speaking in the purest of the mongo-
lian dialects yet you and i have
understood him perfectly and he has
understood every word i have ut-
tered the explanation is merely-
telepathy when i speak the
thought-wave is impelled from my
brain in perfect synchronization with
the spoken word and it is the thought
which he has understood likewise
our comprehension of his speech
now it is true that as an ordinary
man i might never hope to read the

contents of this record for any at-
tempt to decipher it would result in
failure but what this master ne-
cromancer has forgotten is that when
these writings were put on parch-
ment by the guiding genius of black
magic it was merely thought trans-
ferred to paper and that thought is
ever the same changeless i have
but to concentrate and this ancient
thought instantly becomes intelli-
gible-

  a wailing shriek broke from the
lips of the chinaman shrill terrify-
ing in its intensity his face blazed
with the demoniacal fury of a man
gone mad with rage and hatred too
late he realized that travis could in-
deed solve all that which he would
have given his life to conceal

why we of the wanderlust club
did not interfere none of us
was ever able to ascertain after-
ward it was as if we were chained
to our chairs by an irresistible force

  travis and the chinaman were
almost face to face their eyes burned
queerly as will-power met will-power
in mortal terrific struggle how long
they stood thus i do not know it
seemed years yet it could have been
at most only a few minutes

  they say that a chinamans fea-
tures do not betray his inner emo-
tions still i fancied that i saw a
trace of chagrin of disappointment
on the face of this little wrinkled
dried-up old chinaman for a mo-
ment he was baffled-even i knew
that and then i saw him concen-
trating upon the book in travis
hand

  the atmosphere of the room be-
came super-charged with a crackling
rending power one could almost hear
then came a blinding flash of light
an odor of burning parchment

  in the very hands of travis the
books of secrets had burst into a dev-
astating flame
the impossible



  you devil from hell screamed
travis that secret-lost to the
world since the day of the priests of
baal and the prophet god sent de-
vouring fire upon the water-soaked
altar and the priests of baal could
not duplicate the feat because the
only one of their number who knew
the secret of devouring fire had van-
ished lost throughout the ages
and it now appears at the command
of this necromancer

  the chinaman flicked a skinny
clawlike hand in the direction of the
ashes upon the floor i told you
there were secrets which you did not
know he commented softly and

there are yet other mysteries-

  travis whipped out an ugly squat-
looking automatic you have pre-
vented me from publishing that rec-
ord of deviltry he said yet i can
not permit you to return to your
temple and continue the breeding of
evil to visit upon the ignorant and
ill-advised as you have destroyed
that which would have liberated the
world from fear so i shall destroy
you

  there was a cold finality in his
voice and scarce had the words left
his lips than he fired the shot re-
verberated through the room came
the fumes of burned powder acrid
but the chinaman was still standing
unmoved

  an expression of incredulity
touched travis face i could see the
puzzled dazed uncomprehending
look in his eyes for at that distance
he could not have missed he
squeezed the stock of the automatic
yet again-and again

  almost together those two last
shots almost as one so rapidly were
they fired

  and the chinaman had not moved
-until now with one swift step he

reached the person of the man who
was my friend and i saw a glittering
flash of gleaming metal

  travis crumpled his body bent
in the middle sagging then he
crashed to the floor

  a little knowledge is a dangerous
thing murmured the chinaman
quite distinctly a queer glint of a
peculiarly greenish tint showed in
his eyes then slowly slowly his
lids drooped lower and lower as
his eyes were masked by those lower-
ing lids he toppled as might a tower
undermined at its base and fell to
the floor beside the body of travis

  the spell was broken for the first
time in an hour i moved travis
was in my arms his life-blood stain-
ing my garments while all about me
i heard horrified cries

  stark terror depicted upon their
faces they backed away from those
still bodies all but dr broome who
was now crouched beside me

  i too arose and backed away we
waited an eternity

  as broome turned there was an
awed hush

    travis - and that other - both
dead travis had learned too much
and he has paid the penalty for
alone he could not overthrow that
which had existed since first the
world began

  gentlemen tonight we have seen
the chinaman kill our friend after
three bullets had struck him travis
did not miss for in a space which
might be covered by a half-dollar
coin three bullets smashed their way
into the chinamans heart

  therefore when he took that last
step forward and killed travis the
chinaman was already a dead man

  his voice trailed away into a whis-
per we have witnessed the accom-
plishment of the impossible
m arch rd - perhaps

somebody will believe my
story i am a plain man not
given to imagination surely not to
lying you have seen me no doubt
when you came front at the durand
theater you saw me i was the last
orchestra member to come out of the
hole-the one at the far left
you thought me a hunchback per-
haps but i am not my fingers
are knotted a bit and i have become
a little bowed by constant playing of
the bass viol my eyes are not what
they once were my arms have lost
their muscular freedom i am nerv-
ous i know because of this i
shrink from the sight of the front
rows at the durand sometimes i
twitch more than others it is not a


disease nor is the tightness of my
muscles age i am but forty-two
though i look sixty

  i must tell this story before-
well i will be frank in these written
words-before i pass away for i
can not live long my nights of toss-
ing tell me this my weird hours of
pain and nausea tell me i am fad-
ing-fading-fading i will tell it all
and maybe you who later read will
believe my story god somebody
must believe me

  it is the story of the unchained
devil

 twenty-two years ago i was a
pupil of the violin in munich had
we possessed great wealth i would
have been there as a lad of ten for
our neighbors said that my fingers
the unchained devil



 were those of a genius at twelve i
 played better than our first-violin
 now at the durand we did not
 know then that grandfather printz
 owned the dye-works at berlin nor

	did we know that he had standing
 with the german royalty nor did
 we know that-but i am going too
 fast

   when i finished at munich i was
 a concert violinist but my time
 had come for the prussian army i
 rebelled my mother rebelled and
 wept because my art would be
 crushed by three years of army serv-
 ice one day we learned our fate
 more certainly father came in with
 a face aflame a ruling of the
 throne was about to snatch from him
 his toy-inventions he had been
 years perfecting them he cursed
 the ruling powers and said we were
 to flee to america

   it would take thousands of words
 to tell all of our flight i was about
 to be free in america i had had
 distant relatives to return with their
 stories of america and her spirit of
 freedom and her great concert-halls
 and orchestras and her chances for
 being somebody and getting some-
 where father sat half-hidden
 among packs of emigrant belongings
 and whispered his dreams of toy
 production when he should reach
 boston mother stroked my fingers
 and told of her dreams of me as i
 stood before great masses of the rich
 who sat in decorated boxes and
 together we laughed and cried-
 sometimes hours at a time

   never with us-always alone-sat
 grandfather printz he sat silent
 for the ten days we were on ship-
 board and to add to the mystery
 of his silence he leaned against what
 appeared to be a wooden coffin-box
 it was the only possession he had
 brought and when it had been
 loaded by four burly deck-hands he
 had refused all information as to its
 contents now and then he would
 take a small book from his pocket

and write down a few german
words he was the only one how-
ever among us four who knew eng-
lish and he spoke it as a scholar i
learned later from mother that he
had been-years before-in diplo-
matic service and in his early man-
hood an instructor in the university
at gottingen

  perhaps it was hia great joy per-
haps it was the strain of early
army life before father could get
a hearing with american manufac-
turers he died grandfather took
mother and me to a little town north
of boston it was then we knew of
his wealth much to our surprize
he purchased a beautiful though
small estate near the atlantic on
the newly-bought grounds was a
grove of hardy trees in the heart
of the grove he had his coffin-box
opened for the first time-though the
custom-house officers had taken off a
slat or two to estimate the duty it
revealed a carefully-crated statue of
baron von bismarck

  grandfather was radiant as his
workmen placed it

  this franz he said to me
this is to be our inspiration-yours
and mine this is the likeness of
the worlds greatest spirit the em-
bodiment of all that is power and
energy and courage and craftsman-
ship and ambition here is our idol
the iron chancellor sit here with
him in the grove until you catch the
mystery of his being ponder on the
grass by the side of this marble be-
ing until you catch his ambition
we have our work to do-you and
i remember franz

  grandfather doled out his money
solemnly almost stubbornly mother
wished to seek work until i should
come into my own but he would not
hear to it i found him once ten
days after we had become estab-
lished i had been sent by mother
to boston and had chosen to see the
harbor rather than spend my vacant
time in some place of amusement i


weird

tales

came upon grandfather he was
silently and with rare art charting
the harbor his surprize at seeing
me was not as great as his apparent
uneasiness he ordered me away
but secretly i found his notations
later in german words he had writ-
ten upon each sheet in small char-
acters for the fatherland

  i wonder today if grandfather
printz had lived if the fate of
france and belgium would not have
been americas but he aged rap-
idly after leaving munich and he left
us suddenly according to his pa-
pers we shipped his remains back to
munich-the ashes of cremation as
he had directed the papers and
charts he wished returned to berlin
we did not send mother seemed to
divine that he had in his loyalty to
the old been unfaithful to the new
his funds i do not think we ever
found all of them mother directed
into a finishing course for me at bos-
ton conservatory and my initial ca-
reer

t will rush by two years of study
a at boston my chance finally
came i was to be soloist with a
great orchestra mother told me
that afterward managers would flock
to me and the critics would herald
me in anticipation of the triumph i
went to rest for a month or more
back at the little estate which
grandfather had bought

  perhaps i had been there four
days-at least four-when a strange
sensation came over me i am about
to be absolutely honest i do not
understand the spirit world i have
never studied the unseen forces of
nature and mind i am by trade a
musician-a violinist t merely am
writing those sensations which i
felt i do not know that i heard
actual voices i do not know whether
or not actual sound-waves were pro-
duced i can only tell what i actual-
ly heard

  it was late on a friday afternoon

  had been telling mother of my ef-
 forts at mastering english at the
 conservatory later i had gone to
 my own room and was looking about
 on the photographic prints-some of
 munich many more of america
 suddenly i saw grandfather printz
 no form at the judgment throne
 will ever be more real lie appeared
 to be touched with some great zeal
 some big enthusiasm his words
 avere as clear as his living voice-
 only not as loud have you for-
 gotten franz our inspiration-
 yours and mine  ponder on the
 grass by the side of this marble be-
 ing until you catch his ambition we
 have our woik to do-you and i
 remember franz

  by nature i am obedient even
then-in my early twenties-i still
asked permission of my mother for
almost anything i wished to do she
had often smiled and told me i was
a man but the habit was strong
upon me now when grandfather
looked straight at me with unusual
animation i never questioned the
idea that i had an hallucination i
saw grandfather-actual real his
words went into the depths of me
i quickly obeyed any other course
was out of the question without
thinking of mother i almost ran
from the room i do not recall see-
ing the buildings in the outer barn-
lot i do not remember whether i
leapt the fence or opened the gate-
way but ten minutes later i was
in the heart of the grove prostrate
upon the grass-and i was looking
stedfastly upon the marble statue

   nor will i try to imagine how long
 i was there the sun must have
 crept below the hill for i saw the
 - image in the moonlight it was as
 distinct as a fine portrait

   my story is honest i do not know
 how long i was there i do not
 even know why i did not hunger
 crouched there i looked upon the
 face of my grandfathers idol-the
 embodiment of a giant ambition i
the unchained devil



do not recall being numb though i
do not believe i changed my position
for at least three hours

  all of a sudden that finely chiseled
face changed i believe the sky had
beeome overcast for it was necessary
to look more intently to see the dif-
ferent features of the face the face
of von bismarck faded out into an
intense blackness i would judge
that it remained so perhaps for
three or four minutes of time the
mystery held me closely and i stood
to my feet and came a bit eloser
one by one the features took on a
most gruesome hideous likeness
the nose became more pointed and
slender than grandfathers idols
the whole contour was longer and
thinner and sterner if anything be-
fore my gaze there came into being
a face of some terrible and mighty
force or personality or being-call
it anything you will to me it was
nothing short of the face of satan
not differing from the pictured like-
nesses it shone almost as a dull-red
sun against a stormy sky there
was no recognition no smile-in-
deed there appeared to be nothing
personal

  yet i heard a voice before gods
throne i would still declare i heard
a voice

 the words came slowly and yet
with a terrible power that seemed
to make them burn their way into
my consciousness the words sank
so deep that i could scarcely breathe
i know i was absolutely motionless
i felt the sensation of an all-engulf-
ing power of deity-call it what you
wish the voice was harsh and as
if strained in the production like
brands each word burned its way
into memory

  today said the voiee is the
night of toll all things have their
price you have bound me for years
you have shackled me and trodden
me down loose me-loose me or
you shall die loose me and your
dream shall come true loose me

and your art shall beeome wonderful
and terrible-and your name shall be
glorious loose me loose me i am
bound who should be free loose
me and into your fingers shall flow
my power-into your soul shall then
come the rivers of ambition that
none shall stem i am the lord of
power i am the king of all yet
to be

 as quickly as the words were
spoken the direful visage faded out
and i found my eyes looking once
more upon von bismarck i fell to
the ground as in a great swoon
when i awoke mother was weeping
over me she said they had not
found me until dawn

t arch th the pain of the
writing stayed my stiff fingers
from their task you who read will
never know the labor of my record
but i will go  today after my rest
you must know you must judge

  when i was strong again i went
back to the statue this time with
a strange fear that hung upon me
like a cloak but i saw nothing
neither did i hear a word

  today i met an american girl
she lives near by and seems to be an
artist yes she told me-a sculptress
she interested me but i am not for
women i have my art

  she told me to call her minna
she is frail and unlike my old-coun-
try women friends

  she asked all about my story i
did not tell her-she is young and
beautiful and she might-well a
woman can change ones ambition

 i may see her again after my
debut

  her eyes were large and wistful
and she-am i an egotist to think
she is drawn to me 

  bah with the entire sex

  the night before i should go to
new york for the debut i saw
grandfather this was the last time
i ever saw his image he repeated
only a phrase and went from view


weird

tales

into the darkness of my sleeping
room but the phrase branded me
with a swift purpose he said

  this is to be our inspiration 

  i walked slowly this time out into
the grove my mood was unlike any-
thing i had known a strange re-
ceptivity possessed me completely
i felt as one being led into an un-
known land by an untried pathway

  i had not long to wait the spell
did not hold by mystery as on the
first occasion i looked about me i
even walked about the statue and
watched the sun go down behind the
hill i felt oddly unafraid

  with the darkness the terrible
face crept slowly into view and i no
longer viewed my grandparents idol
but the being of satanic likeness and
power

  you will loose me my musician
you have accepted my terms you
will pay the toll    and yours is to
be the power and glory and kingdom
forever and ever and ever

  the voice faded and with it the
terrible face i turned about with
deliberate purpose and walked
slowly back to my mother whom i
found with friends on the veranda
i was not shaken nor to be honest
had i known that i had reached any
decisions  made any surrender i
do know that a very queer sense of
relief possessed me utterly i amused
my mothers friends with some
stories of conservatory life i found
myself laughing with a strange in-
toxication mother even felt my
cheeks fearing a fever had come
with the approach of my great night
t brought out grandfathers ancient
tankard and as we were all of one
blood we drank rather heartily of
the beer and ate with enthusiasm of
the german cakes which mother al-
ways baked with such fine skill i
am not by nature a wit in fact i
have always taken myself too seri-
ously yet on that strange night-
that eve of victory-i became a pun-
ster of the worst sort t sang lilting

snatches of folk-song too and to
cap the evenings mirth i told the
party that on the morrow i would
play like this and-oh god i tell the
truth-i actually transfixed them
my mother most of all at the close of
the rhapsody i had chosen my
mother held me for minutes to her
breast and every woman in the
party kissed me with the silly senti-
mentality of the french

  minna was among them

  i think she had asked mother if
she might not hear me sometime

  the wistfulness of her eyes i am
twice her age at least why do i
even think of her a moment we
arc unlike she asked me for a mo-
ment in the far corner away from
the others she showed me rough
sketches of her sculpture she too
has a gift

  but she has no ambition she will
not go far she managed to reply
to my question about her career by
blushing and saying a home must be
more remarkable than all the careers
in the world

  she is weakly sentimental that
way

ji arch th what surrender
i ever made will always be a
mystery to me i can not name an
hour when i ever said to imp or god
that i would do thus or so but
heart decisions are unlike mind deci-
sions the mind may speak one
thing and the heart be acting along
lines quite contrary the heart in
its decision is still the heart is
never loud never boastful but it
wins over the mind-will or nil

  i went to my debut with no con-
cern in fact my calm puzzled my
friends and made my mother sorrow-
ful she had never known an artist
to feel such an abandon such buoy-
ancy-such utter lack of concern
my fingers ache with their task i
will finish another day

  april nd i could not go on for
days i have been in physical misery
the unchained devil



i can hardly play the bass viol afc
the durand i am aging i am old
and stiff-at forty-two

  but the story i dare not delay it
perhaps i can never finish it if i
neglect my chance

  with nimble fingers i wish to tell
you of that great evening but
cramped fingers can not write with
rapidity and besides you all have
read-ah you have read of franz
printz

  i was everything that night lis-
ten for i am not a boasting lying
man in the name of the blessed
virgin i am even thought modest
but it is gods truth-i was every-
thing i was passion running with
wild abandon down flowering gar-
den-paths to find youth eager and
unafraid in the secret of alluring
caves i was power with my hand
on the river the mill the dynamo
and the forge i was love leading
to a million sacrifices i was fiend-
ish wooing haunting and sir gala-
had on lioly quests i was man in
his striving god with forgiving
satan with his subtle mockeries

  yes they covered me with flowers
and they shrieked their voices hoarse
because their hands could not show
me their homage i was mobbed
kissed and applauded until-

  when it was i do not know i
was heavy with drinking and only
awake enough from to time to time
to feel bare-breasted women leaning
about me it had been a mad car-
nival of the low and beast in me
mother told me later that i left the
stage with critics begging for photo-
graphs and interviews but so she
told i broke away in a delirium of
joy and said that i oivcd a man some-
thing and that i must first pay him

  it was minna who found me how
strange are the ways of good women
she searched for me until she found
me she took her own reputation
into her own hands she fell down
by my side with painted women
showering me with their hectic at-

tentions she dragged me away
against every protest leaning upon
her frail shoulder i came to a park

  the giii confessed her love for
me but i can have none of it i
have a work-if they will only let
me--and they will let me-whatever
gods there be

  days later when i crept back the
critics found me and the managers
crowded upon me for genius is
readily forgiven its dissipations but
when i found my violin it had been
smashed i recall vaguely that i hit
a stage-liand who stood in my way
after my last great number and
with managers pleading for my
booking time i discovered that i
had truly paid a price dearer than
my goal my fingers were worked
not by nimble and trained but by
surely knotted muscles my whole
being was actually warped i could
not stand straight i seemed muscle-
bound and every atom of vital power
seemed to have left me-helpless
mother and the managers spared no
expense i was rubbed and mas-
saged  i was bathed in every known
mineral water but to no avail

  i paid my toll

  and later with difficulty i man-
aged to hold the stubby bow and for
years i have been at the durand
with a bass viol-the purchase of the
last money given me by a broken-
hearted mother the estate went the
friends all save minna forsook me
god turned away from me

  even the unchained devil never
visited me again

  but minna came she came night
after night to share with me the
scant luxury of a walk to my home
or the jars of a surface-car

  she bathes my fingers

  last night she told me that maybe
i could come to see her work it is
an exhibit or something but i will
never go i will not ruin her stand-
ing whatever it has grown to be i
am an outcast a failure    i could
cry from the pain of humiliation


weird tales

until the stars shriek back at me in
mockery

  love has welled np in my hard
heart i love the girl in return-
but i am man enough never to let
her know she is gentle-like the
whisper of new spring in central
park she must have some wealth
i do not understand it but i will
be fair to her i will give her no
wreck

  april th i must add this some
unseen power compels me i have
just gotten word from the manager
of the durand to whom in a moment
of terrible despair i showed these
slowly-penned pages of my life he
says that i must be treated yet
again that new invention and dis-
covery will play upon my tightened
stiffened muscles and i yet will play
he has loaned me a violin and i am
trying daily to play

  april th the symphony or-
chestra needs a first-violin my con-
ductor at the durand has recom-
mended me

tmf ay st it is evening i have
surrendered the bass viol at
the durand and daily they are rub-
bing my muscles i have come to
the old estate bought by grand-
father it will be sunset soon i
am here pondering on the grass by
the side of a marble statue some-
thing has lured something has
called me i do not know what i
do not care only i am here to wateh
and listen-and obey

  it is so near the dusk that i can
hardly see to write  oh god the

  face is changing into the likeness of
satan i and the lips are moving-
moving as they did so long ago yes
it is the same voice and i hear the
same words

 loose me loose me and i
will-

  oh i will i will i will i will
loose you and i shall play in the
symphony with the first violins i
shall   

  may th it was minnas hand
that stopt me at the writing it
was the warm heart of a wonder-
woman who took me away

  i have something to show you
my own she explained

  then she took me back to the
garden her own funds had pur-
chased it all back for me

  then i looked on the miracle that
is love and oh you who read my
honest story dont forget as i did
that love is more than all art or
genius or power

  this was the miracle she had
with skilled fingers changed the
statue of bismarck-von bismarck
the chancellor-into a being scarce a
fourth the size-and it was the like-
ness of a little child

  and she went on this is to
be our new inspiration until-until
the time comes if it ever comes
that god shall give to us a living
child-sent from his glory-throne to
lead us aright

  daily she has massaged my fingers
with more than skill

 today i took a bow into my
hands

  i	can play-i can play a violin

glared ferociously at me through the

latest grievance was some reporter

parbleu non he would better
not the little frenchman replied
his round blue eyes flashing ominous-

soothingly   one suicide is that much
too many people have no right

left the room a moment later i
heard him rummaging about in the

weird

tales

hastily here is an item from mon-
days journal

  two motorists die while driving cars

  the impulse to end their lives apparently
attacked two automobile drivers on the al-
bemarle turnpike near lonesome swamp
two miles out of harrisonville last night
carl planz thirty-one years old of martins
falls took his own life by shooting himself
in the head with a shotgun while seated in
his automobile which he had parked at the
roadside where the pike passes nearest the
swamp his remains were identified by two
letters one addressed to his wife the other
to his father joseph planz with whom he
was associated in the real estate business
at martins falls a check lor three hun-
dred dollars and several other papers found
in his pockets completed identification
the letters which merely declared his in-
tention to kill himself failed to establish
any motive for the act

  almost at the same time and within a
hundred yards of the spot where planzs
body was found by state trooper henry
anderson this morning the body of henry
william nixon of new rochelle n y
was discovered partly sitting partly ly-
ing on the rear seat of his automobile
an empty bottle of windshield cleaner lying
on the floor beside him it is thought this
liquid which contained a small amount of
cyanide of potassium was used to inflict
death police surgeon stevens who ex-
amined both bodies declared that the men
had been dead approximately the same
length of time when brought to the station
house

 what think you of that my
friend heinf de grandin demanded
looking up from the paper with one
of his direct challenging stares

 why-er- i began but he

interrupted

  hear this he commanded tak-
ing up a second paper this is from
the news of tuesday

  mother and daughters die in death pact

  police and heartbroken relatives are to-
day trying to trace a motive for the triple
suicide of mrs ruby westerfelt and her
daughters joan and elizabeth who per-
ished by leaping from the eighth floor of
the hotel dolores newark late yesterday
afternoon the women registered at the
hotel under assumed names went immedi-
ately to the room assigned them and ten
minutes later miss gladys walsh who oc-
cupied a room on the fourth floor was

startled to see a dark form hurtle past
her window a moment later a second
body flashed past on its downward flight
and as miss walsh horrified rushed toward
the window a loud crash sounded outside
looking out miss walsh saw the body of a
third woman partly impaled on the spikes
of a balcony rail

  miss walsh sought to aid the woman
as she leaned from her window and
reached out with a trembling arm she
was greeted by a scream dont try i
wont be saved i must go with mother and
sister a moment later the woman had
managed to free herself from the restrain-
ing iron spikes and fell to the cement area-
way four floors below

  and here is still another account
this one from tonights paper he
continued unfolding the sheet which
had caused his original protest

  high school co-ed takes life in attic

  the family and friends of edna may
mccarty fifteen-year-old co-ed of harrison-
ville high school are at a loss to assign
a cause for her suicide early this morning
the girl had no love affairs as far as is
known and had not failed in her examina-
tions on the contrary she had passed
the schools latest test with flying colors
her mother told investigating police offi-
cials that overstudy might have temporarily
unbalanced the childs mind miss mc-
cartys body was found suspended from
the rafters of her fathers attic by her
mother this morning when the young
woman did not respond to a call for break-
fast and could not be found in her room
on the second floor of the house a clothes-
line used to hang clothes which were dried
inside the house in rainy weather was used
to form the fatal noose

tvtow then my friend de gran-

    	din reseated himself and light-
ed a vile-smelling french cigarette
puffing furiously till the smoke sur-
rounded his sleek blond head like a
mephitic nimbus what have you to
say to those reports am i not right 
are there not too many-mordieu
entirely too many-suicides in our
city

  all of them werent committed
here i objected practically and
besides there couldnt very well be
any connection between them mrs
westerfelt and her daughters carried
the curse of everard maundy



out a suicide pact it appears but
they certainly could have had no un-
derstanding with the two men and

the young girl-

  perhaps maybe possibly he
agreed nodding his head so vigorous-
ly that a little column of ash detached
itself from his cigarette and dropped
unnoticed on the bosom of his stiffly
starched evening shirt you may
be right friend trowbridge but
then as is so often the case you may
be entirely wrong one thing i know
i jules de grandin shall investigate
these cases myself personally cor-
dieu they do interest me i shall
ascertain what is the what here

  go ahead i encouraged the
investigation will keep you out of
mischief and i returned to the sec-
ond chapter of haggards the wan-
derers necklace a book which i have
read at least half a dozen times yet
find as fascinating at each rereading
as when i first perused its pages

the matter of the six suicides still
bothered him next morning
trowbridge my friend he asked
abruptly as he disposed of his second
helping of coffee and passed his cup
for replenishment why is it that
people destroy themselves

  oh i answered evasively dif-
ferent reasons i suppose some are
crossed in love some meet financial
reverses and some do it while tem-
porarily deranged

  yes he agreed thoughtfully
yet every self-murderer has a real
or fancied reason for quitting the
world and there is apparently no
reason why any of these six poor
ones who hurled themselves into
outer darkness during the past week
should have done so all apparent-
ly were well provided for none of
them as far as is known had any
reason to regret the past or fear the
future yet-he shrugged his nar-
row shoulders significantly-voila
they are gone

  another thing at the facults
de medicine legal and the surete in
paris we keep most careful statistics
not only on the number but on the
manner of suicides i do not think
your frenchman differs radically
from your american when it comes
to taking his life so the figures for
one nation may well be a signpost for
the other these self-inflicted deaths
they are not right they do not fol-
low the rules men prefer to hang
slash or shoot themselves women
favor drowning poison or gas yet
here we have one of the men taking
poison one of the women hanging
herself and three of them jumping
to death norn dun canard i am
not satisfied with it

  hm neither are the unfortunate
parties who killed themselves if the
theologians are to be believed i re-
turned

  you speak right he returned
then muttered dreamily to himself
destruction-destruction of body
and imperilment of soul-mordieu it
is strange it is not righteous he
disposed of his coffee at a gulp and
leaped from his chair i go he
declared dramatically turning to-
ward the door

  where

  where where should i go if
not to secure the history of these so
puzzling cases i shall not rest nor
sleep nor eat until i have the string
of the mysterys skein in my hands
he paused at the door a quick elfin
smile playing across his usually stern
features and should i return be-
fore my work is complete he sug-
gested i pray you have the excel-
lent nora prepare another of her so
magnificent apple pies for dinner

  forty seconds later the front door
clicked shut and from the dining
rooms oriel window i saw his neat
little figure trimly encased in blue
chinchilla and gray worsted pass
quickly down the sidewalk his ebony
cane hammering a rapid tattoo on the


weird

tales

stones as it kept time to the thoughts
racing through his active brain

 t am desolated that my capacity
is exhausted   he announced that
evening as he finished his third por-
tion of deep-dish apple pie smothered
in pungent rum sauce and regarded
his empty plate sadly eh bien
perhaps it is as well did i eat more
i might not be able to think clearly
and clear thought is what i shall need
this night my friend come we
must be going

  going where i demanded

 to hear the reverend and es-
timable monsieur maundy deliver his
sermon  

 who everard maundy

  but of course who else

  but-but i stammered looking
at him incredulously why should
we go to the tabernacle to hear this
man i cant say im particularly
impressed with his system and-
arent you a catholic de grandin
who can say he replied as he
lighted a cigarette and stared
thoughtfully at his coffee cup my
father was a huguenot of the hugue-
nots a several times great-grandsire
of his cut his way to freedom through
the paris streets on the fateful night
of august   my mother was
convent-bred and as pious as anyone
with a sense of humor and the gift of
thinking for herself could well be
one of my uncles-he for whom i am
named-was like a blood brother to
darwin the magnificent and huxley
the scarcely less magnificent also
me i am-he elevated his eye-
brows and shoulders at once and
pursed his lips comically-what
should a man with such a heritage be
my friend but come we delay we
tarry we lose time let us hasten
i have a fancy to hear what this mon-
sieur maundy has to say and to ob-
serve him see i have here tickets
for the fourth row of the hall

 very much puzzled but never

doubting that something more than
the idle wish to hear a sensational
evangelist urged the little french-
man toward the tabernacle i rose
and accompanied him

  parbleu what a day he sighed
as i turned my ear toward the down-
town section from coroners office
to undertakers i have run and from
undertakers to hospitals i have
interviewed everyone who could shed
the smallest light on these strange
deaths yet i seem no further ad-
vanced than when i began what i
have found out serves only to whet
my curiosity what i have not dis-
covered- he spread his hands

in a world-embracing gesture and
lapsed into silence

  the jachin tabernacle where the
rev everard maundy was holding
his series of non-sectarian revival
meetings was crowded to overflow-
ing when we arrived but our tickets
passed us through the jostling crowd
of half-skeptical half-believing peo-
ple who thronged the lobby and we
were soon ensconced in seats where
every word the preacher uttered
could be heard with ease

  before the introductory hymn had
been finished de grandin mumbled
a wholly unintelligible excuse in my
ear and disappeared up the aisle and
i settled myself in my seat to enjoy
the service as best i might

  the rev mr maundy was a tall
hatchet-faced man in early middle
life a little inclined to rant and make
use of worked-over platitudes but
obviously sincere in the message he
had for his congregation from the
half-cynical attitude of a regularly-
enrolled church member who looks on
revivals with a certain disdain i
found myself taking keener and
keener interest in the story of re-
generation the preacher had to tell
my attention compelled not so much
by his words as by the earnestness of
his manner and the wonderful stage
presence the man possessed when
the curse of everard maundy



the ushers had taken up the collection
and the final hymn was sung- i was
surprized to find we had been two
hours in the tabernacle if anyone
had asked me i should have said half
an hour would have been nearer the
time consumed by the service

  eh my friend did you find it
interesting    de grandin asked as he
joined me in the lobby and linked his
arm in mine

  yes very i admitted then
somewhat sulkily i thought you
wanted to hear him too-it was your
idea that we came here-what made
you run away

  i am sorry he replied with a
chuckle which belied his words but
it was necessaire that i fry other fish
while you listened to the reverend
gentlemans discourse will you
drive me home

 the march wind cut shrewdly
through my overcoat after the super-
heated atmosphere of the tabernacle
and i felt myself shivering involun-
tarily more than once as we drove
through the quiet streets strangely
too i felt rather sleepy and ill
at ease by the time we reached
the wide tree-bordered avenue before
my house i was conscious of a dis-
tinctly unpleasant sensation a con-
stantly-growing feeling of malaise a
sort of baseless irritating uneasiness
thoughts of years long forgotten
seemed summoned to my memory
without rime or reason an incident
of an unfair advantage i had taken
of a younger boy while at public
school recollections of petty useless
lies and bits of naughtiness com-
mitted when i could not have been
more than three came flooding back
on my consciousness finally an epi-
sode of my early youth which i had
forgotten some forty years

  my father had brought a little
stray kitten into the house and i
with the tiny lads unconscious
cruelty had fallen to teasing the
wretched bundle of bedraggled fur

finally tossing it nearly to the ceiling
to test the tale i had so often heard
that a cat always lands on its feet
my experiment was the exception
which demonstrated the rule it
seemed for the poor half-starved fe-
line hit the hardwood floor squarely
on its back struggled feebly a mo-
ment then yielded up its- entire nine-
fold expectancy of life 

  long after the smart of the whip-
ping i received in consequence had
been forgotten the memory of that
unintentional murder had plagued
my boyish conscience and many were
the times i had awakened at dead of
night weeping bitter repentance out
upon my pillow

  now some forty years later the
thought of that kittens death came
back as clearly as the night the un-
kempt little thing thrashed out its
life upon our kitchen floor strive as
i would i could not drive the mem-
ory from me and it seemed as though
the unwitting crime of my childhood
was assuming an enormity out of all
proportion to its true importance

  i shook my head and passed my
hand across my brow as a sleeper
suddenly wakened does to drive away 
the lingering memory of an unpleas-
ant dream but the kittens ghost like
banquos would not down

  what is it friend trowbridge
de grandin asked as he eyed me
shrewdly

  oh nothing i replied as i
parked the car before our door and
leaped to the curb i was just
thinking

  ah he responded on a rising
accent and of what do you think
my friend something unpleasant
oh no nothing important
enough to dignify by that term i
answered shortly and led the way to
the house keeping well ahead of him
lest he push his inquiries farther

  in this however i did him wrong
tactful women and jules de grandin
have the talent of feeling without be-


weird tales

ing told when conversation is unwel-
come and besides wishing me a pleas-
ant good-night he spoke not a word
until we had gone upstairs to bed
as i was opening my door he called
down the hall   should you want me
remember you have but to call

    humph  i muttered ungracious-
ly as i shut the door want him
what the devil should i want him
for   and so i pulled off my clothes
and climbed into bed the thought of
the murdered kitten still with me and
annoying me more by its persistence
than by the faint sting of remorse
it evoked

how long i had slept i do not
know but i do know i was wide-
awake in a single second sitting up
in bed and staring through the dark-
ened chamber with eyes which strove
desperately to pierce the gloom

  somewhere-whether far or near i
could not tell-a cat had raised its
voice in a long-drawn wailing cry
kept silence a moment then given
tongue again with increased volume

  there are few sounds moie eery to
hear in the dead of night than the
cry of a prowling feline and this one
was of a particularly sad almost re-
proachful tone

  confound the beast i ex-
claimed angrily and lay back on my
pillow striving vainly to recapture
my broken sleep

  again the wail sounded indefinite
as to location but louder more pro-
longed even it seemed fiercer in its
timbre than when i first heard it in
my sleep

  i glanced toward the window with
the vague thought of hurling a book
or boot or other handy missile at the
disturber then held my breath in
sudden affright staring through the
aperture between the scrim curtains
was the biggest most ferocious-look-
ing tom-cat i had ever seen its eyes
seemingly as large as butter dishes
glared at me with the green phos-

phorescence of its tribe and with an
added demoniacal glow the like of
which i had never seen its red
mouth opened to full compass in a
venomous soundless spit seemed
almost as large as that of a lion and
the wicked pointed ears above its
rounded face were laid back against
its head as though it were crouching
for combat

  get out seat i called feebly
but making no move toward the
thing

  s-s-s-sssh a hiss of incom-
parable fury answered me and the
creature put one heavy padded paw
tentatively over the window-sill still
regarding me with its unchanging
hateful stare

  get i repeated and stopped
abruptly before my eyes the great
beast was growing increasing in size
till its chest and shoulders completely
blocked the window should it at-
tack me i would be as helpless in its
claws as a hindoo under the paws of
a bengal tiger

  slowly stealthily its cushioned
feet making no sound as it set them
down daintily the monstrous crea-
ture advanced into the room
crouched on its haunches and re-
garded me steadily wickedly malevo-
lently

  i rose a little higher on my elbow
the great brute twitched the tip of
its sable tail warningly half lifted
one of its forepaws from the floor
and set it down again never shifting
its sulfurous eyes from my face

  inch by inch i moved my farther
foot from the bed felt the floor be-
neath it and pivoted slowly in a sit-
ting position until my other foot was
free of the bedclothes apparently
the cat did not notice my strategy
for it made no menacing move till i
flexed my muscles for a leap sudden-
ly flung myself from the bedstead
and leaped toward the door

  with a snarl white teeth flashing
green eyes glaring ears laid back the
the curse of everard maundy



beast moved between me and the exit
and began slowly advancing on me
hate and menace in every line of its
giant body

  i gave gronnd before it retreating
step by step and striving desperately
to hold its eyes with mine as i had
heard hnnters sometimes do when
suddenly confronted by wild animals

  back back i crept the ogreish
visitant keeping pace with my re-
treat never suffering me to increase
the distance between us

  i felt the cold draft of the window
on my back the pressure of the sill
against me behind me from the
waist up was the open night before
me the slowly advancing monster

  it was a thirty-foot drop to a ce-
mented roadway but death on the
pavement was preferable to the slash-
ing claws and grinding teeth of the
terrible thing creeping toward me

  i threw one leg over the sill watch-
ing constantly lest the cat-thing
leap on me before i could cheat it by

dashing myself to the ground-

  trowbridge mon bicu trow-
bridge my friend what is it you
would do the frenzied hail of
jules de grandin cut through the
dark and a flood of light from the
hallway swept into the room as he
flung the door violently open and
raced across the room seizing my arm
in both hands and dragging me from
the window

 look out de grandin i
screamed the cat itll get you
cat he echoed looking about
him uncomprehendingly do you
say cat my friend a cat will get
me mort dun chou the cat which
can make a mouse of jules de gran-
din is not yet whelped where is it
this cat of yours

  there th- i began then

stopped rubbing my eyes the room
was empty save for de grandin and
me there was nothing animate in the
place

  but it was here i insisted i

tell you i saw it a great black cat
as big as a lion it came in the win-
dow and crouched right over there
and was driving me to jump to the

ground when you came-

  nom dun pore do you say so
he exclaimed seizing my arm again
and shaking me tell me of this
cat my friend i would learn more
of this puss-puss who comes into
friend trowbridges house grows
great as a lion and drives him to his
death on the stones below ha i
think maybe the trail of these myste-
rious deaths is not altogether lost
tell me more mon ami i would
know all-all

  of course it was just a bad
dream   i concluded as i finished the
recital of my midnight visitation
but it seemed terribly real to me
while it lasted

     i doubt it not   he agreed with a
quick nervous nod and on our
way from the tabernacle tonight my
friend i noticed you were much dis-
trait were you perhaps feeling ill
at the time

  not at all i replied the
truth is i was remembering some-
thing which occurred when i was a
lad four or five years old something
which had to do with a kitten i
killed and i told him the whole
wretched business

  um he commented when i
had done you arc a good man
trowbridge my friend in all your
life since you attained to years of
discretion i do not believe you have
done a wicked or ignoble act

  oh i wouldnt say that i re-
turned we all-

   parbleu i have said it that kit-
ten incident now is probably the
single tiny skeleton in the entire
closet of your existence yet sustained
thought upon it will magnify it even
as the cat of your dream grew from
cats to lions size pardieu my
friend i am not so sure you did
dream- of that abomination in the


weird tale

shape of a cat which visited you sup-
pose- he broke off staring in-
tently before him twisting first one
then the other end of his trimly
waxed mustache

  suppose wliat i prompted

  non we will suppose nothing to-
night he replied you will please
go to sleep once more my friend and
i shall remain in the room to frighten
away any more dream-demons which
may come to plague you come let
us sleep here i do remain he
leaped into the wide bed beside me
and pulled the down comforter snug-
ly up about his pointed chin

      and id like very much to
have you come right over to see her
if you will mrs weaver finished
i cant imagine whatever made her
attempt such a thing-shes never
shown any signs of it before

  i hung up the telephone receiver
and turned to de grandin heres
another suicide or almost-suieide
for you i told him half teasingly
the daughter of one of my patients
attempted her life by hanging in the
bathroom this morning

  par la fete bleu do you tell me
so he exclaimed eagerly i go
with you chcr ami i see this young
woman i examine her perhaps i
shall find some key to the riddle
there parblcu me i itch i burn i
am all on fire with this mystery cer-
tainly there must be an answer to it
but it remains hidden like a peasants
pig when the tax collector arrives

yvell rcmns lady whats this i

    hear about you i demand-
ed severely as we entered grace
weavers bedroom a few minutes
later what on earth have you to
die for

  i-i dont know what made me
want to do it doctor the girl im-
plied with a wan smile i hadnt
thought of it before-ever but t
just got to-oh you know sort of

brooding over things last night and
when i went into the bathroom this
morning something-something in-
side my head like those ringing
noises you hear when you have a
head-cold you know-seemed to be
whispering go on kill yourself
youve nothing to live for go on
do it  so i just stood on the scales
and took the cord from my bathrobe
and tied it over the transom then
knotted the other end about my neck
then i kicked the scales away and
-she gave another faint smile-
im glad i hadnt locked the door
before i did it she admitted

  de grandin had been staring un-
winkingly at her with his curiously
level glance throughout her recital
as she conchided he bent forward
and asked this voice which you
heard bidding you commit an un-
pardonable sin mademoiselle did
you perhaps recognize it

  the girl shuddered no she
replied but a sudden paling of her
face about the lips gave the lie to her
word

    pardonn cz-moi madem oiselle  
the frenchman returned i think
you do not tell the truth now whose
voice was it if you please

  a sullen stubborn look spread over
the girls features to be replaced a
moment later by the muscular spasm
which preludes weeping it-it
sounded like fannys she cried
and turning her face to the pillow
fell to sobbing bitterly

 and fanny who is she de
grandin began but mrs weaver
motioned him to silence with an im-
ploring gesture

  i prescribed a mild bromide and
left the patient wondering what mad
impulse could have led a girl in the
first flush of youne womanhood hap-
pily situated in the home of parents
who idolized her engaged to a fine
young man and without bodily or
spiritual ill of any sort to attempt
her life outside de grandin seized
the curse of everard maundy



the mothers arm and whispered
fiercely who is this fanny ma-
dame weaver believe me i ask not
from idle curiosity but because i seek
vital information  

  fanny briggs was graces chum
two years ago mrs weaver an-
swered my husband and i never
quite approved of her for she was
several years older than grace and
had such pronounced modern ideas
that we didnt think her a suitable
companion for our daughter but you
know how girls are with their
crushes the more we objected to
her going with fanny the more she
used to seek her company and we
were both at our wits ends when the
briggs girl was drowned while swim-
ming at asbury park i hate to say
it but it was almost a positive relief
to us when the news came grace
was almost broken-hearted about it
at first but she met charley this
summer and i havent heard her
mention fannys name since her en-
gagement until just now

  ah de grandin tweaked the
tip of his mustache meditatively
and perhaps mademoiselle grace
was somewhere to be reminded of
mademoiselle fanny last night
no mrs weaver replied she
went with a crowd of young folks to
hear maundy preach there was a
big party of them at the tabeffiaele-
im afraid they went more to make
fun than in a religious frame of
mind but he made quite an impres-
sion on grace she told us

  feu de dieu de grandin ex-
ploded twisting his mustache furi-
ously do you tell me so madamef
this is of the interest madame i
salute you he bowed formally to
mrs weaver then seized me by the
arm and fairly dragged me away

  trowbridge my friend he in-
formed me as we descended the steps
of the weaver portico this business
it has vodeur du poisson-how is it
you say-the fishy smell

  what do you mean i asked

  parbleu what should i mean ex-
cept that we go to interview this mon-
sieur everard maundy immediately
right away at once mordicu i
damn think i have the tail of this
mystery in my hand and may the
blight of prohibition fall upon france
if i do not twist it

nphe rev everard maundys rooms
in the tremont hotel were not
hard to locate for a constant stream
of visitors went to and from them

  have you an appointment with
mr maundy the secretary asked
as we were ushered into the ante-
room

  not we de grandin denied
but if you will be so kind as to tell
him that dr jules de grandin of the
paris surete desires to speak with
him for five small minutes i shall be
in your debt

  the young man looked doubtful
but de grandins steady catlike stare
never wavered and he finally rose
and took our message to his employer

  in a few minutes he returned and
admitted us to the big room where
the evangelist received his callers be-
hind a wide flat-topped desk

  ah mr de grandin the ex-
horter began with a professionally
bland smile as we entered you are
from france are you not sir what
can i do to help you toward the
light   

  cordieu monsieur de grandin
barked for once forgetting his cour-
tesy and ignoring the preachers out-
stretched hand you can do much
you can explain these so unexplain-
able suicides which have taken place
during the past week-the time you
have preached here that is the light
we do desire to see

  maundys face went masklike and
expressionless suicides suicides
he echoed what should i know
of-


weird tales

  the frenchman shrugged his nar-
row shoulders impatiently we do
fence with words monsieur he in-
terrupted testily   behold the facts
messieurs planz and nixon young
men with no reason for such desper-
ate deeds did kill themselves by vi-
olence madame westerfelt and her
two daughters who were happy in
their home as everyone thought did
hurl themselves from an hotel win-
dow a little schoolgirl hanged her-
self  last night my good friend trow-
bridge who never understandingly
harmed man or beast and whose life
is dedicated to the healing of the sick
did almost take his life and this very
morning a young girl wealthy be-
loved with every reason to be happy
did almost succeed in dispatching
herself

  now monsieur le predicateur the
only thing this miscellaneous assort-
ment of persons had in common is the
fact that each of them did hear you
preach the night before or the same
night he attempted self-destruction
that is the light we seek explain
us the mystery if you please

  maundys lean rugged face had
undergone a strange transformation
while the little frenchman spoke
gone was his smug professional
smirk gone the forced and meaning-
less expression of benignity and in
their place a look of such anguish and
horror as might rest on the face of
one who hears his sentence of damna-
tion read

 dont-dont he besought
covering his writhing face with his
hands and bowing his head upon his
desk while his shoulders shook with
deep soul-racking sobs oh miser-
able me my sin has found me out  

 for a moment he wrestled in
spiritual anguish then raised his
stricken countenance and regarded us
with tear-dimmed eyes i am the
greatest sinner in the world he an-
nounced sorrowfully there is no

hope for me on earth or yet in
heaven  

  de grandin tweaked the ends of
his mustache alternately as he gazed
curiously at the man before us
monsieur he replied at length i
think you do exaggerate there are
surely greater sinners than you but
if you would shrive you of the sin
which gnaws your heart i pray you
shed what light you can upon these
deaths for there may be more to fol-
low and who knows that i shall not
be able to stop them if you will but
tell me all

  mea culpa maundy exclaimed
and struck his chest with his clenched
fists like a hebrew prophet of old
  in my younger days gentlemen be-
fore i dedicated myself to the sal-
vaging of souls i was a scoffer what
i could not feel or weigh or measure
i disbelieved i mocked at all re-
ligion and sneered at all the things
which others held sacred

  one night i went to a spiritual-
istic seance intent on scoffing and
forced my young wife to accompany
me the medium was an old colored
woman wrinkled half-blind and un-
believably ignorant but she had
something - some secret power -
which was denied the rest of us
even i atheist and derider of the
truth that i was could see that

  as the old woman called on the
spirits of the departed i laughed out
loud and told her it was all a fake
the negress came out of her trance
and turned her deep-set burning old
eyes on me white man she said
yuh is gwine ter feel mighty sorry
fo dem words ah tells yuh de
speerits can heah whut yuh says an
dey will take deir revenge on yuh
an yours-vas an on dem as foilers
yuh-till yuh wishes yo tongue had
been cut out befo yuh said dem
words dis yere night

   tried to laugh at her-to curse
her for a sniveling old faker-but
there was something so terrible in
the curse of everard maundy



her wrinkled old face that the words
froze on my lips and i hurried away

    the next night my wife-my
young lovely bride-drowned her-
self in the river and i have been a
marked man ever since wherever i
go it is the same god has seen fit to
open my eyes to the light of truth
and give me words to place his mes-
sage before his people and many
who come to sneer at me go away be-
lievers but wherever throngs gather
to hear me bear my testimony there
are always these tragedies tell me
gentlemen-he threw out his hands
in a gesture of surrender-must i
forever cease to preach the message
of the lord to his people i have
told myself that these self-murders
would have occurred whether i came
to town or not but-is this a judg-
ment which pursues me forever

  jules de grandin regarded him
thoughtfully monsieur he mur-
mured i fear you make the mis-
takes we are all too prone to make
you do saddle le bon dieu with all
the sins with which the face of man
is blackened what if this were no
judgment of heaven but a curse of
a very different sort hein

  you mean the devil might be
striving to overthrow the effects of
my work the other asked a light
of hope breaking over his haggard
face

  um perhaps let us take that
for our working hypothesis de
grandin replied at present we
may not say whether it be devil or
devilkin which dogs your footsteps
but at the least we are greatly in-
debted to you for what you have told
go my friend continue to preach
the truth as you conceive the truth
to be and may the god of all peoples
uphold your hands me i have other
word to do but it may be scarcely
less important he bowed formally
and turning on his heel strode quick-
ly from the room

  thats the most fantastic story i
ever heard i declared as we
entered the hotel elevator the
idea as if an ignorant old negress

could put a curse on-

  zut de grandin shut me off
you are a most excellent physician
in the state of new jersey friend
trowbridge but have you ever been
in martinique or haiti or in the
jungles of the congo belgique

of course not i admitted

but-

  i have i have seen things so
strange among the voudois people
that you would wish to have me com-
mitted to a madhouse did i but relate
them to you however as that mon-
sieur kipling says that is another
story  at the present we are pledged
to the solving of another mystery
let us go to your house i would
think i would consider all this busi-
ness-of-the-monkey pardieu it has as
many angles as a diamond cut in
amsterdam

pell me friend trowbridge
- he demanded as we concluded
our evening meal have you perhaps
among your patients some young man
who has met with a great sorrow
recently someone who has sustained
a loss of wife  child or parents   

  i looked at him in amazement but
the serious expression on his little
heart-shaped face told me he was in
earnest not making some ill-timed
jest at my expense

  why yes i responded there
is young alvin spence his wife
died in childbirth last june and the
poor chap has been half beside him-
self ever since thank god i was
out of town at the time and didnt
have the responsibility of the case  
thank god indeed de grandin
nodded gravely it is not easy for
us though we do ply our trade among
the dying to tell those who remain
behind of their bereavement rut
this monsieur spence will you call


weird tales

on him this evening will you give
him a ticket to the lecture of mon-
sieur maundy

  no i blazed half rising from
my chair ive known that boy
since he was a little toddler-knew
his dead wife from childhood too
and if youre figuring on making him

the subject of some experiment-

  softly my friend he besought

	 there is a terrible thing loose
among us remember the noble mar-
tyrs of science those so magnificent
men who risked their lives that yel-
low fever and malaria should be no
more was not their work a holy
one certainly i do but wish that
this young man may attend the lec-
ture tonight and on my honor i shall
guard him until all danger of at-
tempted self-murder is passed you
will do what i say

  he was so earnest in his plea that
though i felt like an accessory before
the fact in a murder i agreed

  meantime his little blue eyes snap-
ping and sparkling with the zest of
the chase de grandin had busied
himself with the telephone directory
looking up a number of addresses
culling through them discarding
some adding others until he had
obtained a list of some five or six
now mon vieux he begged as i
made ready to visit alvin spence on
my treacherous errand i would
that you convey me to the rectory of
st benedicts church the priest in
charge there is irish and the irish
have the gift of seeing things which
you colder-blooded saxons may not
i must have a confab with this good
father obrien before i can permit
that you interview the young mon-
sieur spence mordieu me i am a
scientist no murderer

  i drove him past the rectory and
parked my motor at the curb wait-
ing impatiently while he thundered
at the door with the handle of his
ebony walkin stick his knock was
answered by a little old man in cler-

ical garb and a face as round and
ruddy as a winter apple

  de grandin spoke hurriedly to him
in a low voice waving his hands
shaking his head shrugging his
shoulders as was his wont when the
earnestness of his argument bore him
before it the priests round face
showed first incredulity then mild
skepticism finally absorbed interest
in a moment the pair of them had
vanished inside the house leaving me
to cool my heels in the bitter march
air

ou were long enough i

  	grumbled as he emerged from
the rectory

  pardieu yes just long enough
he agreed i did accomplish my
purpose and no visit is either too
long or too short when you can say
that now to the house of the good
monsieur spence if you will mor-
dieu but we shall see what we shall
see this night

six hours later de grandin and i
crouched shivering at the road-
side where the winding serpentine
albemarle pike dips into the hol-
low beside the lonesome swamp the
wind which had been trenchant as a
shrews tongue earlier in theevening
had died away and a hard dull bit-
terness of cold hung over the hills
and hollows of the rolling country-
side from the wide salt marshes
where the bays tide crept up to
mingle with the swamps brackish
waters twice a day there came great
sheets of brumous impenetrable
vapor which shrouded the landscape
and distorted commonplace objects
into hideous gigantic monstrosities

  mort dun petit bonhomme my
friend de grandin commented be-
tween chattering teeth i do not like
this place it has an evil air there
are spots where the very earth does
breathe of unholy deeds and by the
sacred name of a rooster this is one
the curse of everard maundy



such look you at this accursed fog
is it not as if the specters of those
drowned at sea were marching up
the shore this night

  umph i replied sinking my
ncck lower in the collar of my ulster
and silently cursing myself for a fool

  a moments silence then you
are sure monsieur spence must come
this way there is no other road by
which he can reach his home

  of course not i answered short-
ly he lives out in the new weiss
development with his mother and sis-
ter-you were there this evening-
and this is the only direct motor
route to the subdivision from the
city

  ah that is well he replied
hitching the collar of his greatcoat
higher about his ears you will
recognize his car-surely

  ill try to i promised but
you cant be sure of anything on a
night like this id not guarantee to
pick out my own-theres somebody
pulling up beside the road now i
interrupted myself as a roadster came
to an abrupt halt and stood panting
its headlights forming vague lumin-
ous spots in the haze

  mais oui he agreed and no
one stops at this spot for any good
until it has been conquered come
let us investigate he started for-
ward body bent head advanced
like a motion picture conception of
an indian on the warpath

  half a hundred stealthy steps
brought us abreast of the parked
ear its occupant was sitting back
on the driving seat his hands resting
listlessly on the steering wheel his
eyes upturned as though he saw a
vision in the trailing wisps of fog
before him i needed no second
glance to recognize alvin spenee
though the rapt look upon his white
set face transfigured it almost be-
yond recognition he was like a
poet beholding the beatific vision of
his mistress or a medieval eremite

gazing through the opened portals of
paradise

  a-a-ah de oran dins whisper
cut like a wire-edged knife through
the silence of the fog-bound air do
you behold it friend trowbridge

  wha- i whispered back but

broke the syllable half uttered thin
tenuous scarcely to be distinguished
from the lazily drifting festoons of
the fog itself there was a something
in midair before the ear where alvin
spence sat with his yearning soul
looking from his eyes i seemed to
see clear through the thing yet its
outlines were plainly perceptible and
as i looked and looked again i recog-
nized the unmistakable features of
dorothy spence the young mans
dead wife her body-if the tenu-
ous ethereal mass of static vapor
could be ealled sueh-was bare of
clothing and seemed endued with a
voluptuous grace and allure the liv-
ing woman had never possessed but
her face was that of the young wo-
man who had lain in rosedale ceme-
tery for three-quarters of a year if
ever living man beheld the simula-
crum of the dead we three gazed on
the wraith of dorothy spence that
moment

  dorothy-my beloved my dear
my dear the man half whispered
half sobbed stretching forth his
hands to the spirit-woman then fall-
ing back on the seat as the vision
seemed to elude his grasp when a
sudden puff of breeze stirred the fog

  we could not catch the answer he
received close as we stood but we
could see the pale curving lips frame
the single word come and saw
the transparent arms stretched out to
beckon him forward

  the man half rose from his seat
then sank back set his face in sud-
den lesolution and plunged his hand
into the pocket of his overcoat

  beside me de orandin had been
fumbling with something in his in-
side pocket as alvin spenee drew


weird tales

forth his hand and the dull gleam of
a polished revolver shone in the light
from his dashboard lamp the french-
man leaped forward like a panther
stop him friend trowbridge he
called shrilly and to the hovering
vision

  avaunt accursed one begone
thou exile from heaven away
snake-spawn 

  as he shouted he drew a tiny pellet
from his inner pocket and hurled it
point-blank through the vaporous
body of the specter

  even as i seized spences hand and
fought with him for possession of the
pistol i saw the transformation from
the tail of my eye as de grandins
missile tore through its unsubstantial
substance the vision-woman seemed
to shrink in upon herself to become
suddenly more compact thinner
scrawny her rounded bosom flat-
tened to mere folds of leatherlike skin
stretched drum-tight above staring
ribs her slender graceful hands were
horrid claw-tipped talons and the
yearning enticing face of dorothy
spence became a mask of hideous
implacable hate great-eyed thin-
lipped beak-nosed-such a face as
the demons of hell might show after a
million million years of burning in
the infernal fires a screech like the
keening of all the owls in the world
together split the fog-wrapped still-
ness of the night and the monstrous
thing before us seemed suddenly to
shrivel shrink to a mere spot of bale-
ful phosphorescent fire and disap-
pear like a snuffed-out candles
flame

  spence saw it too the pistol
dropped from his nerveless fingers to
the ears floor with a soft thud and
his arm went limp in my grasp as he
fell forward in a dead faint

 parbleu de grandin swore
softly as he climbed into the uncon-
scious lads car let us drive for-
ward friend trowbridge we will
take him home and administer a

soporific he must sleep this poor
one or the memory of what we have
shown him will rob him of his rea-
son  

  so we carried alvin spence to his
home administered a hypnotic and
left him in the care of his wondering
mother with instructions to repeat
the dose if he should wake

it was a mile or more to the nearest
bus station and we set out at a
brisk walk our heels hitting sharply
against the frosty concrete of the
road

 what in the world was it de
grandin i asked as we marched in
step down the darkened highway

it was the most horrible-

  parbleu he interrupted some-
one comes this way in a monstrous
hurry

  his remark was no exaggeration
driven as though pursued by all the
furies from pandemonium came a
light motor car with plain black sides
and a curving top look out the
driver warned as he recognized me
and came to a bumping halt look
out dr trowbridge its walking it
got out and walked  

  de grandin regarded him with an
expression of comic bewilderment
now what is it that walks mon
brave he demanded mordicu
you chatter like a monkey with a
handful of hot chestnuts what is
it that walks and why must we look
out for it heinf

 sile gregory the young man
answered he died this mornin
an mr johnson took him to th par-
lors to fix im up an sent me an
joe williams out with him this
evenin i was just drivin up to th
house an joe hopped out to give me
a lift with th casket an old silas
got up an walked away an mr
johnson embalmed im this mornin
i tell you  

  nom dxin chou-fleur de gran-
din shot back arid where did this
the curse of everard maundy



so remarkable demonstration take
place mon vieux also what of the
excellent williams your partner
i dont know an i dont care
the other replied when a dead
corpse i saw embalmed this mornin
gets outa its casket an walks i aint
gonna wait for nobody jump up
here if you want to go with me i
aint gonna stay here no longer

 biende grandin acquiesced
  go your way my excellent one
should we encounter your truant
corpse we will direct him to his wait-
ing biere

  the young man waited no second
invitation but started his car down
the road at a speed which would
bring him into certain trouble if ob-
served by a state trooper

  now what the devil do you make
of that i asked i know john-
son the funeral director well and i
always thought he had a pretty level-
headed crowd of boys about his place
but if that lad hasnt been drinking

some powerful liquor ill be-

  not necessarily my friend de
grandin interrupted i think it
not at all impossible that he tells but
the sober truth it may well be that
the dead do walk this road tonight
i shivered with something other
than the nights chill as he made the
matter-of-fact assertion but forbore
pressing him for an explanation
there are times when ignorance is a
happier portion than knowledge

  we had marched perhaps another
quarter-mile in silence when de gran-
din suddenly plucked my sleeve
have you noticed nothing my
friend he asked

  what dye mean i demanded
sharply for my nerves were worn
tender by the night s events

  i am not certain but it seems to
me we are followed

  followed nonsense wlio would
be following us i returned uncon-
sciously stressing the personal pro-
noun for i had almost said what

would follow us and the implica-
tion raised by the impersonal form
sent tiny shivers racing along my
back and neck

  de grandin cast me a quick ap-
praising glance and i saw the ends
of his spiked mustache lift suddenly
as his lips framed a sardonic smile
but instead of answering he swung
round on his heel and faced the
shadows behind us

  hola monsieur le cadavre he
called sharply here we are and-
sang du diable-here we shall
stand

  i looked at him in open-mouthed
amazement but his gaze was turned
stedfastly on something half seen in
the mist which lay along the road

  next instant my heart seemed
pounding through my ribs and my
breath came hot and choking in my
throat for a tall gangling man sud-
denly emerged from the fog and
made for us at a shambling gait

  he was clothed in a long old-
fashioned double-breasted frock coat
and stiffly starched shirt topped by a
standing collar and white ministerial
tie his hair was neatly though
somewhat unnaturally arranged in a
central part above a face the color
and smoothness of wax and little
flecks of talcum powder still clung
here and there to his eyebrows no
mistaking it johnson artist that he
was had arrayed the dead farmer in
the manner of all his kind for their
last public appearance before rela-
tives and friends one look told me
the horrible incredible truth it was
the body of old silas gregory which
stumbled toward us through the fog
dressed greased and powdered for
its last long rest the thing came
toward us with faltering uncertain
strides and i noticed with the sud-
den ability for minute inventory fear
sometimes lends our senses that his
old sunburned skin showed more
than one brand where the formalde-
hyde embalming fluid had burned it


weird tales

  in one long thin hand the horrible
thing grasped the helve of a farm-
yard ax the other hand lay stiffly
folded across the midriff as the em-
balmer had placed it when his pro-
fessional ministrations were finished
that morning

  my god i cried shrinking
back toward the roadside but de
grandin ran forward to meet the
charging horror with a cry which was
almost like a welcome

  stand clear friend trowbridge
he warned we will fight this to a
finish i and it his little round
eyes were flashing with the zest of
combat his mouth was set in a
straight uncompromising line be-
neath the sharply waxed ends of his
diminutive mustache and his shoul-
ders hunched forward like those of a
practised wrestler before he comes
to grips with his opponent

  with a quick whipping motion he
ripped the razor-sharp blade of his
sword-cane from its ebony sheath and
swung the flashing steel in a whir-
ring circle about his head then sank
to a defensive posture one foot ad-
vanced one retracted the leg bent at
the knee the triple-edged sword
dancing before him like the darting
tongue of an angry serpent

  the dead thins never faltered in
its stride three feet or so from
jules de grandin it swung the heavy
rust-encrusted ax above its shoulder
and brought it downward its dull
lack-luster eyes staring straight be-
fore it with an impassivity more ter-
rible than any glare of hate

 sa ha de grandins blade
flickeied forward like a streak of
storm lightning and fleshed itself to
the hilt in the corpses shoulder

  he might as well have struck his
steel into a bag of meal

  the ax descended with a crushing
devastating blow

  de grandin leaped nimbly aside
disengaging his blade and swinging
it again before him but an expression

of surprize-almost of consternation
-was on his face

  i felt my mouth go dry with ex-
citement and a queer weak feeling
hit me at the pit of the stomach the
frenchman had driven his sword
home with the skill of a practised
fencer and the precision of a skilled
anatomist his blade had pierced
the dead mans body at the junction
of the short head of the biceps and
the great pectoral muscle at the
coracoid process inflicting a wound
which should have paralyzed the arm
-yet the terrible ax rose for a sec-
ond blow as though de grandins
steel had struck wide of the mark

  ah de grandin nodded under-
standingly as he leaped backward
avoiding the ax-blade by the breadth
of a hair bien a la fin

  his defensive tactics changed
instantly flickeringly his sword
lashed forward then came down and
back with a sharp whipping motion
the keen edge of the angular blade
bit deeply into the corpses wrist lay-
ing bare the bone still the ax rose
and fell and rose again

  slash after slash de grandin gave
his slicing cuts falling with almost
mathematical precision in the same
spot shearing deeper and deeper
into his dreadful opponents wrist
at last with a short clucking ex-
clamation he drew his blade sharply
back for the last time severing the
ax-hand from the arm

  the dead thing collapsed like a de-
flated balloon at his feet as hand and
ax fell together to the cement road-
way

  quick as a mink de grandin thrust
his left hand within his coat drew
forth a pellet similar to that with
which he had transformed the coun-
terfeit of dorothy spence and
hurled it straight into the upturned
ghastly-calm face of the mutilated
body before him

  the dead lips did not part for the
embalmers sutures had closed them
the curse op everard maundy



forever that morning but the body
writhed upward from the road and
a groan which was a muted scream
came from its flat chest it twisted
back and forth a moment like a
mortally stricken serpent in its death
agony then lay still

  seizing the corpse by its grave-
clothes de grandin dragged it
through the line of roadside hazel
bushes to the rim of the swamp and
busied himself cutting long straight
withes from the brushwood then dis-
appeared again behind the tangled
branches at last

     it is finished   he remarked step-
ping back to the road let us go
wha-what did you do i
faltered

  i did the needful my friend
morbleu we had an evil a very evil
thing imprisoned in that dead
man and i took such precautions
as were necessary to fix it in its
prison a stake through the heart a
severed head and the whole firmly
thrust into the ooze of the swamp-
voild it will be long before other
innocent ones are induced to destroy
themselves by that

  but- i began

  non non he replied half
laughing en avant mon ami i
would that we return home as quick-
ly as possible much work creates
much appetite and i make small
doubt that i shall consume the re-
mainder of that so delicious apple pie
which i could not eat at dinner  

jules de grandin regarded the
empty plate before him with a
look of comic tragedy may end-
less benisons rest upon your amiable
cook friend trowbridge he pro-
nounced but may the curse of
heaven forever pursue the villain who
manufactures the wofully inadequate
pans in which she bakes her pies
hang the pies and the plate-
makers too i bufst out you
promised to explain all this hocus-

pocus and ive been patient long
enough stop sitting there like a
glutton wailing for more pie and
tell me about it

  oh the mystery he replied
stifling a yawn and lighting a cigar-
ette that is simple my friend
but these so delicious pies-however
i do digress

  when first i saw the accounts of
so many strange suicides within one
little week i was interested but not
greatly puzzled people have slain
themselves since the beginning of
time and yet-he shrugged his
shoulders deprecatingly-what is it
that makes the hound scent his
quarry the war-horse sniff the battle
afar off who can tell

  i said to me there is undoubt-
lessly more to these deaths than the
newspapers have said i shall in-
vestigate 

  from the coroners to the under-
takers and from the undertakers to
the physicians yes parbleu and to
the family residences as well i did
go gleaning here a bit and there a
bit of information which seemed to
mean nothing but which might mean
much did i but have other informa-
tion to add to it

  one thing i ascertained early in
each instance the suicides had been
to hear this reverend maundy the
night before or the same night they
did away with themselves this was
perhaps insignificant perhaps it
meant much i determined to hear
this monsieur maundy with my own
two ears but i would not hear him
too close by

  forgive me my friend for i did
make of you the guinea-pig for my
laboratory experiment you i left in
a forwaid seat while the reverend
gentleman preached me i stayed in
the rear of the hall and used my eyes
as well as my ears

  what happened that night
why my good kind friend trow-
bridge who in all his life had done


weird tales

 greater wrong than thoughtlessly
to kill a little so harmless kitten did
almost seemingly commit suicide
but i was not asleep by the switch
my friend not jules de grandin
all the way home i saw you were dis-
trait and i did fear something would
happen and i did therefore watch be-
side your door with my eye and ear
alternately glued to the keyhole
parbleu i entered the chamber not
one little second too soon either

   this is truly strange i tell me
my friend hears this preacher and
nearly destroys himself six others
have heard him and have quite killed
themselves if friend trowbridge
were haunted by the ghost of a dead
kitten why should not those others
who also undoubtlessly possessed dis-
tressing memories have been hound-
ed to their graves by them

   there is no reason why they
should not i tell me

  next morning comes the sum-
mons to attend the young mademoi-
selle weaver she too have heard
the preacher she too have attempt-
ed her life and what does she tell
us that she fancied the voice of
her dead friend urged her to kill her-
self

  ah ha i say to me this
whatever-it-is which causes so much
suicide may appeal by fear or per-
haps by love or by whatever will
most strongly affect the person who
dies by his own hand we must see
this monsieur maundy it is per-
haps possible he can tell us much

  as yet i can see  light-i am
still in darkness-but far ahead i
already see the gleam of a promise
of information when we see mon-
sieur everard maundy and he tells
us of his experience at that seance
so many years ago-parbleu i see it
all or almost all

  now what was it acted as agent
for that aged sorceress curse

  he elevated one shoulder and
looked questioningly at me

 how should i know i an-
swered

  correct he nodded how in-
deed beyond doubt it were a spirit
of some sort what sort we do not
know perhaps it were the spirit of
some unfortunate who had destroyed
himself and was earthbound as a
consequence there are such and
as misery loves company in the
proverb so do these wretched ones
seek to lure others to join them in
their unhappy state or maybe it
were an elemental

 a what i demanded

  an elemental-a neutrarian
  what the deuce is that

  for answer he left the table and
entered the library returning with a
small red-leather bound volume in
his hand you have read the works
of monsieur rossetti he asked
yes

  you recall his poem eden bow-
ers perhaps

  hm yes ive read it but i
never could make anything of it
quite likely he agreed its
meaning is most obscure but i shall
enlighten you attendez-moi
thumbing through the thin pages
he began reading at random

  it was lilith the wife of adam

  not a drop of her blood was human

  but she was made like a soft sweet
    woman 

  lilith stood on the skirts of eden

  she was the first that thence was driven
  with her was hell and with eve was
  heaven 

  what bright babes had lilith and adam
  shapes that coiled in the woods and
  waters

  glittering sons and radiant daugh-
    ters 

  you see my friend

  no im hanged if i do

  very well then according to the
rabbinical lore before eve was
created adam our first father had
a demon wife named lilith and by
the curse op everard maundy



her he had many children not
human nor yet wholly demon

  for her sins lilith was expelled
from edens bowers and adam was
given eve to wife with lilith was
driven out all her progeny by adam
and lilith and her half-man half-
demon brood declared war on adam
and eve and their descendants for
ever these descendants of lilith
and adam have ever since roamed
the earth and air incorporeal hav-
ing no bodies like men yet having
always a hatred for flesh and blood
because they were the first or elder
race they are sometimes called ele-
mentals in the ancient lore some-
times they are called neutrarians
because they are neither wholly men
nor wholly devils me i do not take
sides in the controversy i care not
what they are called but i know what
i have seen i think it is highly pos-
sible those ancient hebrews misin-
terpreting the manifestations they
observed accounted for them by
their so fantastic legends we are
told these neutrarians or elementals
are immaterial beings absurd not
necessarily what is matter-mate-
rial electricity perhaps-a great
system of law and order throughout
the universe and all the millions of
worlds extending throughout infinity

  very good so far but when we
have said matter is electricity what
have we to say if asked what is
electricity me i think it a modi-
fication of the ether

   very good you say but what
is ether

  purlieu i do not know the
matter-or material-of the universe
is little if anything more than elec-
trons flowing about in all directions
now here now there the electrons
coalesce and form what we call solids
-rocks and trees and men and wom-
en but may they not coalesce at a
different rate of speed or vibration
to form beings which are real with
emotions and loves and hates similar

to ours yet for the most part invis-
ible to us as is the air why not
no man can truthfully say i have
seen the air yet no one is so great
a fool as to doubt its existence for
that reason

  yes but we can see the effects of
air i objected air in motion for

instance becomes wind and-

  mort dun crapaud he burst
out and have we not observed the
effects of these elementals-these
neutrarians or whatsoever their
name may be how of the six sui-
cides  how of that which tempted the
young mademoiselle weaver and the
young monsieur spence to self-mur-
der how of the cat which entered
your room did we see no effects
there heinf

  but the thing we saw with young
spence and the cat were visible i
objected

  but of course when you fancied
you saw the cat you were influenced
from within even as mademoiselle
weaver was when she heard the voice
of her dead friend what we saw
with the young spence was the shad-
ow of his desire-the intensified love
and longing for his dead wife plus
the evil entity which urged him to
unpardonable sin

  oh all right i conceded go
on with your theory

  he stared thoughtfully at the
glowing tip of his cigarette a mo-
ment then it has been observed
my friend that he who goes to a
spiritualistic seance may come away
with some evil spirit attached to him
-whether it be a spirit which once
inhabited human form or an ele-
mental it is no matter the evil ones
swarm about the lowered lights of the
spiritualistic meeting as flies congre-
gate at the honev-pot in summer it
appeals such an one fastened to
everard maundy his wife was its
first victim afterward those who
heard him preach were attacked
consider the scene at the taber-


weird tales

nacle when monsieur maundy
preaches emotion emotion-all is
emotion reason is lulled to sleep by
the power of his words and the
minds of his hearers are not on their
guard against the entrance of evil
spirits they are too intent on what
he is saying their consciousness is
absent pouf the evil one fastens
firmly on some unwary person ex-
plores his innermost mind finds out
his weakest point of defense with
you it was the kitten with young
mademoiselle weaver her dead
friend with monsieur spence his
lost wife even love can be turned to
evil purposes by such an one

  these things i did consider most
carefully and then i did enlist the
services of young monsieur spence
you saw what you saw on the lonely
road this night appearing to him
in the form of his dead beloved this
wicked one had all but persuaded
him to destroy himself when we in-
tervened

  tres bien we triumphed then
the night before i had prevented
your death the evil one was angry
at me also it was frightened if i
continued i would rob it of much
prey so it sought to do me harm me
i am ever on guard for knowledge is
power it could not lead me to my
death and being spirit it could not
directly attack me it had recourse
to its last resort while the young
undertakers assistant was about to
deliver the body of the old monsieur
gregory the spirit seized the corpse
and animated it then pursued me

  ha almost i thought it had done
for me at one time for i forgot it
was no living thing i fought and at-
tacked it as if it could be killed but
when t found my sword eould not kill
that which was alreadv dead t did
cut off its so abominable hand t am
very clever my friend the- evil
spirit reaped small profits from
fighting with me

  he made the boastful admission in

all seriousness entirely unaware of
its sound for to him it was but a
straightforward statement of undis-
puted fact i grinned in spite of
myself then curiosity got the better
of amusement what were those
little pellets you threw at the spirit
when it was luring young spence to
commit suicide and later at the
corpse of silas gregory i asked

  ah-his elfish smile flickered
across his lips then disappeared as
quickly as it came-it is better you
do not ask me that won chcr let it
suffice when i tell you i convinced
the good pere o brien that he should
let me have what no layman is sup-
posed to touch that i might use the
ammunition of heaven against the
forces of hell

  but how do we know this ele-
mental or whatever it is wont come
back again i persisted

  little fear he encouraged the
resort to the dead mans body was its
last desperate chance having elect-
ed to fight me physically it must
stand or fall by the result of the
fight once inside the body it could
not quickly extricate itself half an
hour at least must elapse before it
could withdraw and before that time
had passed i had fixed it there for
all time the stake through the heart
and the severed head makes that body
as harmless as any other and the
wicked spirit which animated it must
remain with the flesh it sought to per-
vert to its own evil ends henceforth
and forever

 but-

  ah bob he dropped his cigar-
ette end into his emptv coffee cup
and yawned frankly we do talk
too much mv friend this nights
work has made me heavy with sleep
let ns take a tinv sin of cognac that
the rie mav not give us unhappy
dreams and then to bed tomorrow
is another da and who knows what
new task lies before us

exhausted he flung himself back
into the pew he felt drowsy
dreamy he lost consciousness

 never read of odd and bizarre
occurrences or of happenings
which seem beyond mortal ken
but i think of a tale related to me by
a gentlemanin whom i have the ut-
most confidence and which is in my
experience unique although no doubt
students of the occult particularly in
eastern lands will be able to parallel
it directly it sees the light of day
which i think it has not done before
i shall begin to relate it without any
further prolixity

  it was on a warm july night that i
sat with my friend cumberland-the
reverend wilfred cumberland-in
his study the roar of london traffic
had quieted down the stars winked
at us gravely through the pall of soft
coal smoke that still overhung the

city and which was added to by the
clouds of smoke from our cigars it
was very warm

  cumberland is by nature one of
the untidiest men i know and as
usual his desk was littered all over
with this and that compelling him to
pull out a drawer to support his
elbow as he sat and smoked this
drawer was also crammed full of
heterogeneous papers some of which
appeared to be letters recently re-
ceived and some of which were yel-
low and cracked at the edges

  the untidy seldom censure our
neatness but we always feel we must
chide their want of care cumber-
land said i do you never clear
out your desk

  about once a year he replied

                                     go


weird

tales

but it does no good there is sel-
dom much in it that i can bear to
part with i dont know how others
manage but i am irresolution itself
when it comes to destroying old pa-
pers for instance this is a memo-
rial pamphlet gotten out at the time
of the death of gibbons the first rec-
tor i served under a fine chap this
is a copy of some verses-worthless
i havent a doubt-written by one of
the boys in my sunday school class
on the occasion of my ordination of
course they are funny-they would
be merely funny to anyone else this
is a guide to winchester cathedral-
i might go there again you know so
you see how it is in fact the place
seldom gets weeded out except when
i happen-hang it ive done it again
now  

  by a careless gesture with the hand
which held his cigar he had started
what was evidently his only method
of desk-clearing-an accidental con-
flagration the hot ash from the
tobacco had fallen into the open
drawer and the papers had started
blazing merrily frantically he be-
gan to pull out the bundle of pa-
pers which were burning before the
whole contents of the drawer were in-
volved

  he was successful in saving the
rest of his cherished trash but when
he had flung the blazing package into
the empty grate it was itself a total
loss

 he viewed this with dismay
now see he cried there goes a
bunch of papers which i valued high-
ly i had rather burned all the rest
of the drawer than that

  one glance had showed me that the
bundle contained no securities nor
anything of real value but i tried to
conceal my amusement nevertheless

  he continued those were the
notes from which i was about to start
constructing what i hoped would be
a very interesting monograph for the
society for the investigation of

psychic phenomena i was indeed
and you dont recollect the story
without the papers

  quite but there are certain de-
tails which people would expect to
find included in such an article and
as i always have been poor on dates

and other figures- he sighed

  would the tale suffer so much
with those left out

  not as a story i suppose but i
fear it would be unacceptable to a
scientific magazine  it would not
sound convincing at all in fact i
dont believe i could ever have made
it sound anything but impossible so
perhaps it is no matter  

  there is nothing so interesting as
an improbable tale from a truthful
person my dear chap wont you
let me have it from your lips some-
time if i am never to have the chance
to read it in the societys bulletin
well then he retorted smiling
no time like the present the mist
i see has turned to quite a heavy
rain i couldnt allow you to go out
in it unless you were extremely de-
termined so compose yourself my
excellent fellow to be talked to
sleep  

    instruct then your audience of
one since a larger one is denied you
and in doing so crystallize your own
memories before they become dim-
mer  

after carefully closing the drawer
the reverend wilfred lit another
cigar crossed his legs and began

    it was when i was at oxford that
it all happened that must have been
thirty years ago my failings you
know well of course but in one sub-
ject i never came a cropper that of
english literature this fact came
very near to changing the entire
course of my life i wonder if i
should ever have been able to get
used to life in an indian palace and
if i should have made a good raja
tangled skeins



when my turn came well no mat-
ter i was not obliged to after all

  i stared and he went on

  i sat in my study at magdalen
smoking one evening when someone
knocked on the door as my usual
companions dispensed with that
formality i concluded it must be a
proctor and rose to open instantly
i regretted rising for my caller was
not only merely a fellow student but
one for whom i cared very little
although principally for racial rea-
sons he was an east indian

  no one could say that chundun
had anything wrong with him yet i
strongly preferred my own color and
race and childishly the fact that i
had been so courteous as to rise and
open for him irked me

  	  good evening mr cumberland 
he said in his almost perfect eng-
lish may i come in

   certainly i growled resuming
my seat and my pipe churlishly but i
motioned him to a chair

  he entered and shut the door be-
hind him with a grace that seemed
a little out of place for some reason-
it suggested a panther to me-he
crossed the room and took the chair
i had indicated

   i have come to ask you a very
great favor  he began immediately

  i frowned and was silent

   i am most anxious he con-
tinued to return to my home eng-
land is no place for me it is too
cold too cold in every way my
father is old very old he can not
live long now we fear i should be
with him i should also be at hand
in case the time comes for me to suc-
ceed to the throne there are other
sons older than i although i am the
only child of the ranee and there is
but one ranee and if i am not on
the spot my fathers throne may be
polluted by the son of a nautch girl
who knows and in that case what
would he do to my mother who

would never acknowledge him i do
not like to think sir

   well chundun i never realized
you were a prince before i replied
but the government will take care of
your rights i have no doubt

   perhaps he said and per-
haps not as long as there was no
general massacre your government
might keep its hands off ours is but
a small principality among the hills
and with the best of intentions
troops do not reach a place instantly
they are sent much can be done to
a woman in a few hours my mother
is but a small woman 

  this last sentence which he in-
troduced so irrelevantly somehow
brought up such a picture of horror
that i am still at a loss to account
for it except by means of thought
transference i had never inquired
into the details of indian methods of
torture

  i shuddered and chundun went
on almost without a pause and i
can not return to india without my
degree my father expects it

   naturally i remarked dryly
i fancied the dark face flushed
but chundun went on quite calmly
 i can pass in everything but english
literature it-i ask your pardon-
fails to hold my attention my inter-
est no doubt the manner of think-
ing in the two races is too different
this addison for example-what is
he to me  i can read him but after-
ward i can not answer questions
about what i have read what is it
to me pardon me it is only non-
sense 

   then why not elect something
else

   ah but it is too late i have
elected at the end of this term i
should be finished all i should re-
ceive my degree and return to my
dear father and so i am asking
your help

   if you want a tutor ill take
you on i had become interested at


weird tales

last but its awfully late to start
in with a tutor now 

   too late replied chundun
the examination is but a week off i
must use different means someone
must take the examination for me 

 cumberland paused for a few
puffs and then smiled at me rue-
fully now i know just what i
should have done then as well as you
do i ought to have stood up and
showed chundun the door but i
didnt i was short of funds as
usual i needed to return home not
to succeed to my fathers throne but
to help him with the family excheq-
uer where even the expenses of my
graduation were coming from i was
not certain so to my shame it is
spoken i looked at the indian with a
sickly smile and answered do you
think we look enough alike that with
some sort of face stain-

   i mean nothing so crude as
that mr cumberland he rejoined
i mean to suggest that we exchange
bodies for the day of the examination
in literature

   we what i jumped from my
seat

   do not be so astonished sir
went on chundun smoothly i am
not surprized at your feelings and
am deeply grateful that you have not
doubted my sanity as many of your
countrymen would have done it is
true nevertheless that i am able to
do this thing in fact i have repeated-
ly done it i exchanged forms several
times with a servant in india and i
do not doubt that with some degree
of concentration it can be done equal-
ly well in england if it does not
turn out as we expect we shall be
none the worse off-you in particu-
lar

  i flushed silently

  chundun went on in his clear
smooth tones i am not you see as
densely ignorant of all matters as of
english literature i have studied

for some years with the priests and
brahmins of my country 

  he relapsed into silence

  my curiosity thoroughly aroused
by this time i wished intensely to
see what this intended process could
be like i had not the least faith in
it but wanted to see it through as i
should in those days have stayed out
a show in a cheap museum also i
wanted to laugh a little at chundun
when he failed we agreed to his
plans which included a large fee to
me part of which he insisted upon
paying immediately his knowledge
of my finances seemed to me then
almost uncanny now i think it is
the most ordinary reasoning
cumberland laughed he contin-
ued

  the date for the experiment was
set the day previous to the examina-
tion in which chundun expected in
his own character to fail i had fin-
ished all my own so was free he
came to my rooms at  oclock that
evening and we talked awhile first
he telling me something of his habits
that the next morning chundun
might not appear to be acting too
oddly

   and what do you call this
process chundun i asked

   it is called in india then fol-
lowed a long indian word instantly
forgotten and sometimes another
unpronounceable name in eng-
lish it is termed a metempsychosis
but this strikes me as singularly in-
accurate as to change souls would
be manifestly impossible the body
envelope so readily laid aside uni-
versally at the hour of death can
also be laid aside temporarily during
life my soul however is indissolubly
connected with my consciousness
i agreed with him

  at a quarter before  i remem-
ber looking at my clock as i lay on
my bed the process of body ex-
change according to chundun was
now about to commence
tangled skeins



  i had expected a fire in a brazier
incense smoke incantations and i
know not what of mystic ceremonies
in this i was disappointed i can not
remember any fear only a faint sense
of amusement and a great curiosity
had i been a good christian in those
days i should undoubtedly have had
nothing to do with the whole matter
had i been even a poor romanist i
should have protected myself in some
way by prayer alas those were my
agnostic days

  chundun began proceedings by a
brief injunction to me to concentrate
on the matter in hand and then was
silent himself he was reclining on
my lounge the body being wholly
at rest he said assisted the powers
of the mind and soul we continued
in silence a few minutes and i began
to get drowsy then i heard chun-
duns voice a few moments in some
sort of singsong chant in what i knew
to be hindustani but could not
catch a word of the voice now
ceased and i began again to grow
sleepy

  presently although the drowsi-
ness continued it was strangely per-
meated by a sense first of strain then
of giddiness similar to the feeling
when succumbing to an anesthetic it
was accompanied now however by no
drumming in the ears as total un-
consciousness supervened i was con-
scious of a sense of being lifted in
some way then i returned to my
senses very suddenly with a feeling
of having been out only about a
minute

ou may believe me or not gris-

  r wold i awoke on the couch i
looked over to the bed in surprize for
chundun but on it lay a white man
of a familiar appearance i sat up
suddenly and saw that my hands
were brown i ran over to examine
the man on the bed he was living
in my own body

  so the thing really happened
i interjected

  yes went on cumberland the
impossible actually occurred as one
hears of its doing every once in a
while my powers of mind and mem-
ory were just what they had always
been when i recovered from the
shock of surprize and terror which
accompanied my awaking from the
trance and although my friend
would not allow me to go in my be-
wildered state to his rooms to spend
the night but insisted on my occupy-
ing my own bed for the nonce while
he used the couch in the morning i
was quite myself-in a brown body 
and you took the examination
successfully for the indian prince
to my shame yes

  and then changed back i sup-
pose  most astounding  

  the next night i spent in my own
rooms also as chundun and i agreed
it would be best to stay where one of
us knew exactly where everything
was i could see though that my
striker was more than astonished to
find an indian spending two nights
with me he was plainly disgusted

  at  oclock the following eve-
ning thoroughly tired of each others
bodies we agreed to resume our own
and locking the door as before pre-
pared for the second change we lay
down we concentrated chundun
chanted i became drowsy and then
-nothing more i awoke out of the
drowsiness i had not lost my senses
completely as at first to find myself
still brown still a prisoner in a body
not my own

  how can i describe that endless
night the repetition of the process
the strained concentrating which
one of us knew nothing about in
reality the varied incantations in
hindustani all perfectly useless we
faced the dawn in utter despair
which even chunduns eastern stoi-
cism could not conceal

  as we sat there in the gray mist
of morning we could make no plans
save for the immediate present the


weird tales

nest night we would both spend in
his rooms until i became accustomed
to where he kept his belongings and
then the false life must continue un-
til-what 

   perhaps chundun suggested
we are now unduly exhausted all
may go well next time we make the
attempt to change in the mean-
while let us rest relax refresh mind
and body

  rest relax with this frightful
problem eating out our hearts
should i never again be myself never
again see my family embrace my
mother and sisters should i have
to go and be a prince in india
loathsome thought how i should
undoubtedly hate the climate and the
surroundings i had no fear but
that i would make an excellent ruler
but this gave me little comfort

  chundun being an indian i have
no way of guessing how much of
similar import went through his
mind when i met him in the halls
and grounds of the college his face
my face appeared unmoved but
i presume his face which i wore be-
trayed my grief conspicuously and
disgraced its real owner

  our deceitful examination in
literature had been the last one
scheduled for either of us the day
of commencement drew on arrived
i received chunduns diploma and
he mine i carried his continually in
a pocket

  that night i went to my old
rooms to see him we tried once
more to regain our own bodies it was
in vain under a calm exterior he
looked haggard and worn he in-
sisted on accompanying me back to
his rooms where he divided equally
between us come what would the
thousand or so pounds which he kept
there he declared that if we finally
failed to regain our own physical en-
velopes i must go to india and take
up his duties and he would let his
father know lest i be found out and

suffer i was silent never could i
counsel him to take my place could
i see my sisters in the arms of one
whose body was a brother to them
but whose soul was that of an in-
dian no he must stay away from
deven i thought

  most of the time we were now
alone i suppose chundun did not
act like me and so was shunned as a
changed man by my old cronies i
was too disheartened to care for any
company and no one spoke to me but
the instructors and a couple of other
indian students who i suspect knew
all having been confided in by chun-
dun it was manifestly impossible
for me to do the same with my
friends my troubles would merely
have been aggravated by the risk of
being committed to a madhouse

it was now the day following the
graduating exercises the pre-
vious day most of the students had
departed i was glad that none of
my people had been up to the com-
mencement i could not have borne
it today was the latest day i could
with any face start for home i did
not know if chundun intended to do
this for me or not i could not bear
to think of him with my family it
was worse than the thought of going
to india i had not even asked the
exact location of the kingdom in
which he expected me to take his
place and never seeing my dear ones
again myself

  i wandered about oxford in a
despairing state unable to make up
my mind as to my next move the
only trouble that i did not have i
felt was lack of funds and finally
i decided to take train for liverpool
and ship for america there at least
i could lose myself among strangers
and grief might finally dull itself
out no doubt i should be able to
get some kind of work in time and
as virtually  one in america was
acquainted with any of the tongues
tangled skeins



of india i should not present the
anomaly of an east indian unable
to talk a word of hindustani

  i repaired to thfe railroad station
and bought my ticket for liverpool
i took first class that i might be
alone the train did not start for an
hour i wandered about waiting i
had no luggage i did not know
which set of luggage belonged to me
and was too discouraged to try to
find out

  as i traversed for the last time
the well-known streets of the old
town i was drawn by the strains of
one of chopins nocturnes and found
myself entering a small old church
very dark and peaceful where the
organist was giving a most beautiful
recital to himself and the doves in the
ivy-covered belfry above i sank into
a pew and seemed to stop thinking

    i often wonder now how long that
blessed musician played and i sat
motionless scarcely knowing who or
what i was stunned still by my grief
yet comforted by the familiar and
beautiful strains of some of the best
music ever written by mortals final-
ly i think i fell asleep

  suddenly i came to myself with
a start the music had ceased i was
wide-awake with my mind unusually
clear clearer far than it had been
since the day i had left my own
body but what astonished me most
was that i had also a complete
change of mind not in regard to my
grief at my dreadful predicament
but in regard to my worse than in-
difference to the religion of my
parents suddenly i saw myself as
i was and the enormity of my offense
against god and man in agreeing to
a cheat in taking part in a mystic
ceremony of whose import i must
necessarily be ignorant in carrying
out the deception come what
would i thought i would do what i
could to rectify matters what should
i do the first thing that occurred
to me was to find chundun and re-

turn the money then a second and
stronger impulse forced me to un-
accustomed knees and to a prayer of
penitence which was probably the
first genuine one i had ever offered
the sweep of utterly new religious
feeling i had always hated church
from a child probably because i was
taken to too many services each sun-
day seemed to me far the most won-
derful thing in my whole experience
and after praying for forgiveness i
was moved to ask also for a deliver-
ance from my dreadful predicament
then exhausted i flung myself back
into the pew

   	 i felt drowsy dreamy i lost con-
sciousness

  then i awoke with a start i
leaped to my feet the church would
be locked up for the night perhaps
i must find chundun i must make
restitution i started for the door

    then i staggered back in sur-
prize where was i not in the lit-
tle old church near the railway sta-
tion but in my own room at magda-
len i fell back into a chair as-
tounded i glanced down at my
hands

  they were white

  i was myself again thanks be to
god but where was chundun

  it took a few moments of reflec-
tion to see that he must have been sit-
ting probably dozing and receptive
in a chair in my sitting room and i
upon my return to my own body had
found myself there so he must have
awakened in the church thither i
hastened

     it was still unlocked but the sex-
ton was about to close it i asked if
i might first see if a friend of mine
were there perhaps asleep he has
just had a great shock ihad the
forethought to explain we went in
together the sexton and i the
church was empty

  i came out perplexed i wan-
dered about and then sought the sta-
tion had an indian gentleman


weird tales

taken the liverpool train he had

  	 quick-witted chundun no doubt
he had found the ticket in my pocket
when he came to himself and fearing
perhaps even to look once more on
myself or the scenes where his indian
enchantments worked only in their
first part he had fled incontinently
for home

  i never saw him again nor heard
from him he never even sent for
the contents of his rooms at the col-
lege and i believe they were finally
sold at auction i fancied he wished
me to have them but he never left
any word to that effect for which i
was very glad the cheat was now
irrevocable or at least it would have
served no purpose to have exposed it
no doubt chundun knew far more
than the average oxford don as
for the money in the course of years
i have paid it to the church-to mis-
sions in india he added with a
smile

  and how do you account for it
cumberland

  i dont altogether perhaps as

i said charms dont work so well
away from their native heath per-
haps again one person had to be
dominant at thefirst change the
other at the second and i had
always left the responsibility to
chundun perhaps again the sweep-
ing changes of conversion in my own
soul necessitated in some way its also
returning to the body in which it had
been created no griswold i dont
explain it i am only very thankful
i am not on an indian throne at this
moment a place i should be about as
fit to occupy as fido here that is
all there is to the story

  and he arose and strolled to the
window it was late the rain had
ceased big ben was chiming mid-
night

  after all i said as i rose to de-
part cumberland i dont think it
is a paper for the society i am in-
clined to think it is a sermon

  he smiled a little ruefully   shoe-
maker stick to your last said he
anyhow its a story

  and in that i agreed with him

 a fable

    by clark ashton smith

	lords and gods that are the assigning tide upon
some prowless beach where a forgotten fisher dwells

at length will leave the sea-flung jars of solomon 

and he the fisher fumbling mid the weeds and shells
shall find them and shall rive the rusted seals and free
the djinns that shall tread down thy towering iron hells

and turn to homeless rack thy proud reality

that shall re-mold thy pyramids and mountains flown
and lift atlantis on their shoulders from the sea

to flaunt her kraken-fouled necropoli unknown

and lift again those vaster peaks that saw the veil
of fire from primal suns on plains calescent thrown    

o	lords and gods that are i tell a future tale
some frenzy must have overcome me
next i tore away the wires and
overturned the globe

during the two years that i
had acted as secretary to dr
brodsky assisting him in his
psychical experiments i had been en-
abled to build up an active medical
practise of my own my duties were
light often the doctor did not call
upon my services for two or three
weeks together more and more rare-
ly had he done so of recent months
and gradually the conviction sure
although intuitive was borne in upon
me that the days of our association
were numbered

 although comparatively young in
years brodsky lived through the
existences of three ordinary men

  note-this is the eleventh and last of a
series of stories each complete in itself deal ins
with dr ivan brodsky the snrtreon of souls
the series began in weird tales for septem-
ber 

his early revolutionary career in
poland his struggles in america at
first for the mere necessities of life
afterward for success finally the
dedication of his career to the solu-
tion of psychical problems had sa-
tiated him with worldly experiences
he was unmarried his only ties lay
as he had told me upon the veiled
shore of eternity i felt that life held
nothing further for him

  death he said to me once is
no result of physical processes so
wonderful a machine is the human
body that there exists no reason at
all why it should not go on forever
what kills is the satiation with earth-
ly experiences that comes to us it is
the longing of the soul for its resting
place where it stores up and absorbs


weird tales

all the results of its earthly achieve-
ments until it is ready to renew them
in some fresh incarnation 

  and you-are you satisfied i
ventured to ask

  not with the world he an-
swered but with my own person-
ality-yes i am tired of ivan brod-
sky these incarnations are the
merest halting places in the souls
long pilgrimage i would like to take
up my work afresh but in a different
body so that i might forget brodsky
with his hopes and longings and dis-
appointments and face the world
with the fresh anticipations and new
faith of a child

  but that is annihilation i
cried all the dreams of immortal-
ity that are the hope of the world the
desire for continued personal exist-
ence after death-are these all use-
less

  by no means the doctor an-
swered the personality persists
after the change called death it re-
mains so long as it is needed rein-
carnation is not fulfilled until the
soul has grown tired of its remem-
brances and voluntarily descends
after some thousand years of dreams
to gain new experiences and then
though it puts off the old personality
forever the results of its acts remain
to modify its new life shadowy re-
membrances flit through the brain
old friends are encountered besides
in the end everything is remembered

  for those who wish continued
personality there is a heaven of rest
where every dream and hope come
true but as for myself i confess
if only i could start life again and
take up my work in a new body i
should be infinitely content nor
will this be long i believe

  i knew that he alluded to his heart
which was somewhat affected yet
the danger was not imminent nor
likely to become so for many years
to come

- at any rate i shall be ready to

answer the call when it comes said
the doctor he walked over to his
desk and unlocked a drawer here
is a sealed letter that i have left
you he said after my death you
will open it

  i wondered even then why he did
not lock the drawer

  i remembered this conversation the
more vividly in the light of subse-
quent events it must have been a
little more than a week later when he
sent for me

  i am resolved to undertake an ex-
periment he said more difficult
than any that i have ever attempted
it has been done before yet it is
arduous and uncertain you have
heard of the indian fakirs who
actually pass over the borderland of
death allowing themselves to be
buried in a grave on which the grass
sprouts only to be revived after a
period of months

  you will not attempt such an ex-
periment as that   i cried

  no answered the doctor it
would be senseless to attempt so fool-
ish an experiment without grave rea-
son nevertheless i am planning one
somewhat analogous i intend to pass
through the gates of death for the
sake of giving back to one who has
been deprived of it his inheritance
of the soul

  you mean the imbecile i cried
suddenly understanding

  yes answered the doctor i
hope that this will succeed but if my
own death be the result at least the
last act of my life will have been to
some good purpose and i could
not dissuade him from his intention

among the dozen or more inmates
of dr brodskys home whom
he maintained out of his own pocket
was an imbecile orphan some seven
years of age this child had never
exhibited the slightest sign of intelli-
gence he lived a purely vegetative
existence had never learned to erawl
the ultimate problem



to utter a word he did not even
possess the common animal faculty of
recognizing one person from another
as there existed no apparent cause
for this defect no deformity of the
head or body and the vital functions
seemed in perfect condition many
theories had been advanced as to the
cause of so singular an anomaly dr
brodsky after studying the child for
many months had finally formulated
his own conclusions

  it is one of those rare cases he
said in which the soul was not born
into the body it remains shut out
as you can imagine yourself shut out
of your house doubtless it is hover-
ing in close proximity to the mortal
form connected as it must be by the
ethereal ligatures that bind it to the
spinal cord in this condition it is
virtually deprived of its existence
upon either of the planes it is earth-
bound and spirit-bound and there
is only one remedy some other dis-
embodied soul must assist it it is
my plan to pass out of the body
temporarily and to compel it to in-
carcerate itself

  and if you can not return i
cried

   i shall ask your assistance in this
matter the doctor answered i
shall give you careful instructions
which you will fulfil to the letter if
after the lapse of a certain time you
find that these attempts are fruitless
you will break open the letter which
i have left for you in the bureau
drawer and read it

  i can hardly tell how this project
affected me in vain i pointed out to
the doctor the inexpediency from a
purely utilitarian point of view of
risking his own life for the sake of
giving intelligence to the imbecile
but my words were unheeded i felt
that in truth this was to be our last
experiment that it amounted almost
to premeditated suicide i refused
to participate in it

  well in the end of course i con-
sented though i felt that this would
be the last occasion upon which i
should look into the doctors face
while he was alive looking back
now i think my mind must have been
warped i accuse myself a hundred
times of having been the cause of
brodskys death yet the first lesson
that he had implanted in my mind
ever since i first heard him lecture to
us students at the hospital was the
duty of obedience he had com-
manded and it was for me to obey
especially however i base my vindi-
cation upon that hypnotic power
through the medium of which brod-
sky possessed the ability to compel
me or anyone else to obey him

  some days elapsed before the ex-
periment was made brodsky occu-
pied himself during this interval as
i surmised in setting his affairs in
order at last upon the afternoon
appointed i repaired with him to his
laboratory a long chamber in the
rear of the house completely shut off
from all communication with the out-
side ordinarily there was no sound
within but now a great electrical
engine buzzed and throbbed beside a
low flat table raised only some six
inches above the floor and surmount-
ed by a large bowl of translucent
blue into which the wires entered
upon the table the imbecile child sat
propped up against a flexible pillow
of rubber or some similar non-
conducting material searching the
room with his large lack-luster eyes
the doctor stooped over his machine
and made his adjustments then he
connected a rubber sponge at the
termination of a network of wires
with the childs spine and boiind it
there with strips of cloth in such a
manner that it could not be removed
he drew another wire terminating
in a similar sponge from the recesses
of the machine and affixed it to him-
self in the same way finally he
united both to the metal base of the


weird

tales

globe with a clamp immediately the
globe became dark and opaque

  that is the measure of our vital
forces he said and now i will
give you your instructions

  it was my intention to ask you
to press the lever which will send the
high voltage through our bodies but
in case of any untoward results you
would reproach yourself with being
my slayer i shall therefore myself
press the lever and lay upon you
only the responsibility of recalling
me to life again

  when i press this lever it will
send a current of electricity of
several thousand volts directly
through our bodies the effect will
be the same as that which is produced
by an electrocution now it has al-
ways been my claim-although the
authorities of our prisons would
never permit me to demonstrate it-
that the man who has suffered elec-
trocution can invariably be revived
by the proper methods since the cur-
rent merely paralyzes the nerve cen-
ters and suspends the vital functions
without destroying any of the tissues
the criminal who goes to the electric
chair dies not from the effects of the
current but under the surgeons
knife i have especially contrived
this instrument for the purpose of
proving my contention although i
little imagined at the time i set it
forth that i was likely to be the first
subject the soul which is purely
electrical is attached to the body by
extremely tenuous but none the less
substantial ligaments and when
driven out by some violent shock re-
mains for some days floating above
it until the ligaments give way and
set it free by means of this mechan-
ism i claim that the expelled soul can
tie conducted along the wire and
stored within the globe which is a
perfect vacuum and where its pres-
ence will be indicated by the appear-
ance of a wisp of light

  to sum up  shall electrocute

myself and the imbecile child you
will wait until you see the two
threads of flame appear within the
center of the globe then you will
fling back the lever and again push
it forward to the notch marked e
that will be all your task the re-
versal of the current will again force
each separate soul along the wire-
mine into my own body and the
imbeciles i hope into his

  but if you do not awake i
cried

  you will then wait until some un-
usual symptom intervenes either in
the child or in myself and now i
confess that i am sufficiently human
to feel a certain sense of apprehen-
sion so give me your hand remem-
ber if this should be our last ex-
periment we have yet many more
parts to play and lives to play them
in be ready to play your own part
sturdily in this

t te gripped my hand in farewell
l my own answered the pressure
then i averted my head and waited
meanwhile brodsky kneeling on the
low table in the position of a japan-
ese in some old print about to commit
the fatal thrust that should cause
instantaneous death braced himself
against the rubber pillow and
stretched out his hand i heard the
soft thud of the doctors body as he
collapsed sidewise and suddenly the
opaque globe became a dazzling blue
and blue fire spluttered along the
wires it was almost too bright for
my eyes to look into it gradually it
subsided the globe became a pearly
gray and therewithin dimly visible
through the glass were two bright
flames butterfly-shaped they seemed
to pursue each other as goldfish in
a bowl ciicling and doubling upon
their courses now approaching each
other now dancing apart now fused
into one elongating and again re-
treating to opposite sides of the
globe yet never for one instant did
the ultimate problem



they cease to hover with poised and
pendulous wings i stole a glance at
the body of the doctor he had fallen
upon his side and lay motionless ap-
parently lifeless his limbs out-
stretched and stiffened as those of a
man in some cataleptic trance while
at his side in the same state the im-
becile lay with glassy eyes wide open
was it indeed possible i asked my-
self that those two souls one imbe-
cile the other a compendium of
knowledge and fineness should in
reality be those foolish circling but-
terfly-shaped lights that hovered and
danced continually i must have
watched them in fascination for fully
five minutes before i suddenly re-
called the doctors instructions

  but my hands shook so that i could
with difficulty lay them upon the
lever i caught it at last reversed it
and sent it forward again to the
notch e instantly the flames
divided there came a hiss and splut-
ter and the wire was once more
aflame with the blue light then a
convulsive trembling seized upon the
limbs of the imbecile he gasped
drew in a long breath and sat up
his eyes fixed themselves gravely on
mine but it was no longer a glance
of blankness as though there were no
mind behind the vision he saw me
when i moved the eyes followed
mine and a current of unintelligible
babbling came from between the
childs lips but brodsky lay as
when he had fallen nor was there
any relaxation in the stiffened limbs

  a spasm of fear seemed to turn the
muscles of my heart to stone i
stared into the bowl there was but
one light there now a tiny fluttering
thing that seemed each moment to
become more and more attenuated
it danced more feebly beating from
side to side in inefficiency now dart-
ing back now dancing forward once
again to where the wires entered the
vacuum i bent over the body of the
doctor chafing the hands in vain i
touched the cheeks now growing

cold more and more slowly moved
that butterfly light it hovered a
pitiful tiny thing poised in the
midst of the globe which was itself
changing in color and slowly fading
in brilliancy now it was a deep
blue merging into indigo and from
the edges black shadows seemed to
creep forward and envelop that little
spark at the heart of it this became
but a pin-point of light then it
glowed no more than the burnt-out
end of a match one instant it
flickered up then it went out abrupt-
ly and the globe was utterly dark
and opaque i placed my hand once
more on the doctors it was icily
cold and as i bent over him i saw
the stiffness go out of the muscles
and the limbs relax

  some frenzy must have overcome
me next i must have torn away the
wires and overturned the globe for
when i came to my senses nothing re-
mained of the apparatus except the
lifeless bulk of the electrical machine
while all around me was a wreckage
of wires i lifted the doctors body
in my arms and carried him into his
study i laid him upon a lounge and
injected strychnin into the veins
there was no response i placed my
ear against his heart it did not stir
against his lips i laid a little mirror
of silvered glass it was not clouded
and suddenly i felt a thing pulling
at my coat it was the imbecile
child it had crawled after me then
i understood this was the unusual
symptom of which brodsky had
spoken then i knew that i had ex-
hausted all my resources i rushed
to the telephone and summoned medi-
cal aid hours afterward as it ap-
peared to me though it was in reality
only a matter of minutes a doctor ar-
rived i tried to stammer out some
explanation but he cut me short

  heart disease he pronounced
i warned him only last week that he
must be prepared there will be no
need of an autopsy


weird tales

  but the soul i stammered
the soul in the glass globe

  the doctor looked at me gravely

  you must lie down and rest he
answered it must have been a
great shock to you  sol knew that
my words would go for less than
nothing

t was ill for weeks after that

   friends took charge of the fu-
neral friends whom brodsky had
aided who appeared in countless
numbers from unexpected quarters
the funeral partook almost of the
character of a public demonstration
even i had never known the extent
of brodskys benefactions even the
physicians of the town who had re-
garded him more or less with sus-
picion participated in the cere-
monies the newspapers were filled
with long accounts of the dead mans
works his psychical researches were
dismissed lightly but not contemptu-
ously as the vagaries of a great
thinker the relaxations of a scientist
when the will was read i found that
i had been left sole executor and
chief legatee the remainder of the
doctors fortune was to go to endow
the home which he had established

  then one day while looking
through the doctors papers i came
upon a sealed letter addressed to me
i had forgotten all about it in the
strain that i had gone through
hastily i broke the seal and read

  you must pardon me my dear
friend ran the letter if for the
second time i have wilfully deceived
you the first occasion as you will
remember well was when you first
came to me when i hypnotized you
in my study for the purpose of turn-
ing your mind from the gloomy
thoughts of suicide that possessed
you on this occasion i felt impelled
to say less than the truth for fear
that you would attempt to dissuade
me from my purpose

  i told you that i intended to

make my most difficult experiment to
go through the gates of death and to
search out and bring back with me
the soul of the imbecile child for-
give me for having made this state-
ment it was an impossibility the
electric current that i sent through
my own body with my own hand de-
stroyed once and for all the vital
powers nothing on earth could have
restored them i tell you this in order
that you may not think you were
remiss or negligent in your endeavors
to resuscitate me the two flames that
you will doubtless have seen within
the globe were not the souls but only
those n-rays which are given forth
from all living things whether men
beasts or trees when the last flame
went out the organism was dead be-
yond possibility of recall

  the child revived because the
current was so graduated that it
merely stunned without destroying
that duller organism had it been
of a force proportioned to that which
passed through my own body noth-
ing could have revived him but now
to explain more fully what it was my
intent to do and what i hope and
think that i have done

  as i have told you i knew that
no power on earth could bring the
soul into the childs body it was in
fact born soulless nothing more than
a vital organism it was my purpose
then in dying to transfer my own
identity into that childs body so that
while the ivan brodsky whom you
knew disintegrated slowly according
to the natural processes of the body
his spirit might gain a new lease of
life and grow to manhood forgetful
of the old ills and troubles eager to
fulfil the work that i had laid down
for myself

  i leave him in your care doubt-
less within a few days he will begin
to manifest a human intelligence as
he grows older he will have vague
memories of my own life he will
repay your care with the truest affec-
the ultimate problem



tion since i myself shall be his inspir-
ing spirit and this you know i feel
for you he will have also strange
reminiscences will recall faces of per-
sons strange to him but known to me
these recollections you will discour-
age remember that he is a new
being whose life is as yet an unwrit-
ten page and that the past must
remain sealed to him through all his
life

  train him then in the medical
profession and guide his mind so
that when he reaches maturity he
will voluntarily take up those studies
of mine where i have dropped them
i have embodied these in a typewrit-
ten document which you will find in
a secret drawer at the back of my
bureau here followed instruc-
tions for opening it in these in-
structions you will learn much that i
have never told you of things that in
the hands of evil men might plunge
the whole world into barbarism and
shake down the pillars of civiliza-
tion here followed some purely
personal instructions but above
all remember that i leave everything
to your absolute discretion since all
things are appointed to their own
end and if my hopes are vain noth-
ing can bring them to fruition

when i had finished reading this
letter i sat thinking for a long
while then i went to the bureau

and after some fumbling found and
pressed the secret spring a drawer
flew back in it i found a typewrit-
ten paper half covered with dried
rose petals i unfolded it and began
slowly to read  i read till the day
was gone   then i committed it to
the flames

  for i felt and still feel that many
as were the evils which brodsky
cured during the brief period of our
association the world is better off
without this knowledge of his the
risks were too many and after all
as he had always said this is a world
of light there is a long eternity when
we shall be shut off from external
activities when the things of the soul
only will be of account let us not
meddle with them here but go about
our appointed tasks in the manner set
for us

  the boy is growing to manhood
already he is planning to enter the
medical school i find in him odd
traces of brodsky odd flashes of
memory and intuitive appreciation of
the things brodsky cared for but i
discourage all his interest in the
realm of psychic things it may be
that his will will prove stronger than
mine that he will succeed in taking
up the doctors work where brodsky
abandoned it in such event i shall
give way until that happens i shall
fulfil my trust in the spirit of my
own interpretation
a story of the australian gold diggings

the el dorado
of death

      by percy b prior

the brothers w akeford
worked together in a south
australian chemical factory
there was a strong bond of sympa-
thy between them they were insep-
arable pals both of an adventurous
disposition they chafed at the re-
strictions of city life and constantly
planned to go prospecting like all
young men and not a few elderly
ones they dreamed of earning easy
money working merely in order
to make a bare living did not coin-
cide with their ideas of what life was
meant for we have all of us at
some time or other experienced this
feeling

  one evening while they were
drinking together they fell into con-
versation with a bearded man
bronzed and weather-beaten gaunt
and keen-eyed they thought at
first that he was merely one of those
pests always to be found hanging
around hotels but were not long in
discovering their error

  many of his reminiscences were
concerned with prospecting he had
sought for gold along the banks of
creeks in lonely bush gullies and
many were the stories he told the
two wakefords of perils and hard-
ships of occurrences-grim some of
them others ludicrous-that by
turns had gladdened and sad-
dened his adventiirous wanderings
warmed by their hospitality the old
bushman told them among other
places of a valley in the macdonnell


range and of a thin wisp of stream
that meandered through it in the
dry bed of which near a certain
gnarled and aged tree gold-dust
plenty of it glittering in the sand
could be scooped up in handfuls

  in proof that his story was not an
hallucination he showed the brothers
a small quantity of the precious
metal in a tobacco tin and also gave
them a plan of the gully roughly
scrawled on a scrap of paper with
full directions for reaching it they
were astonished that he made no en-
deavor to sell them his secret in-
stead of divulging it gratuitously
his explanation however seemed
reasonable enough he had for
years he said been a martyr to
rheumatism but hopeful of shaking
it off sufficiently to go gold-liunting
again he had never mentioned the
gully and its auriferous creek-bed
to a living soul alone in the world
and no longer hopeful of recovery
he saw no reason why its where-
abouts should continue to remain a
secret

  their meeting with the old pros-
pector inflamed imaginations and
roused dormant aspirations sudden-
ly deciding to throw off their shack-
les they left their chemical factory
and purchasing a tent blankets and
other equipment set out in search of
their el dorado

  they could not have selected a
more inopportune time to begin their
quest the heat that summer was
the el dorado of dexth



phenomenal unused to hardships
that would have tried the stoicism of
hardened bushmen the brothers
wakeford trudged onward with
their heavy packs the sun blazing
fiercely down upon them their feet
which had never previously been
called upon to carry them as far in
a week as now tramping from dawn
to dark in heavy blucher boots they
were compelled to travel every day
became blistered and raw insects
of many kinds some of them poison-
ous bit and stung the two men with
persistency

  at last the younger brother half-
crazed by the heat and parched with
thirst became too ill to proceed
farther and a camp was made in a
drear and lonely spot beside a stag-
nant pool in a forest of dead and
gaunt gum-trees that raised bleached
branches as though in supplication
to a relentless and white-hot sky

  a more appropriate scene for a
tragedy indeed could scarcely be
imagined a thunderstorm at first
muffled and far away crept even
closer and finally crashed above the
tent of the two unfortunates who
weakened by privation and comatose
with fatigue and despair huddled
inside it the storm intensified the
desolation the melancholy and the
loneliness filling them with a sense
of foreboding as though of some im-
pending calamity

  the younger wakefords suffer-
ings in particular were intense
much more so than those of his
brother for besides being weak and
light-headed for want of proper
nourishment and as a result of ex-
posure to the pitiless sun he was a
nerve-racked and under-vitalized fel-
low moody and imaginative

night illuminated by flashes of
lightning and made hideous by
the cannonading of warring clouds
closed round the desperate wayfarers

  despite the uproar aches and

pains and a strained and over-
wrought state of mind by reason of
which he was on the verge of hysteria
the younger wakeford controlling
himself by an effort of will deter-
mined to await resolute and alert
the issue of events which he somehow
felt without knowing how or why
were impending

  the elder brother overcome by
weariness fell into a deep and dream-
less slumber

  wakeford the younger was aroused
toward midnight from a revery by
feeling that someone or something
had entered the tent raising his
eyes he beheld bending over him a
tall figure in white which signed to
him to follow he rose immediately
and the white-robed figure leading
the way they began to traverse a
succession of damp and dark corri-
dors seemingly endless until they
reached at last an enormous cav-
ern filled with a moonlike radiance
where dancing was in progress

  strains of weird music were pierced
by a continuous strange and staccato
clicking sound like the turbulence of
castanets

 bewildered and dazed by the
sudden transition from darkness and
desolation to the glittering and
crowded hall of festivities it was
some moments before wakeford the
younger was able to comprehend in
its entirety what was going on
when he did so he was chilled to the
bone with horror for the white-robed
figures gliding hither and thither
across the crystal floor were skele-
tons and the curious and continu-
ous staccato sound which resembled
castanets was the clicking of their
fleshless jaws

  the music ceased and the couples
separated seating themselves upon
benches of iridescent stalagmites
ranged round the walls then after
a brief interval of awful and un-
broken silence the invisible musi-


weird tales

cians commenced again and the
skeletons to a different rhythm this
time began once more to glide about
the cavern floor

  young wakeiord was petrified
with terror the white-robed figure
he had followed into the cavern
seemed taller than any of the others
and to be in a position of command
it now ordered him by signs to se-
lect a partner for the next dance
from the hideous throng surrounding
him

  horrified he shrank from it tried
to run but held by some strange
power was unable to move from
where he stood

  irritated the tall figure turning
upon him threateningly raised its
arm to strike quick as thought

young wakeford whose legs alone
seemed stricken with paralysis
pulled a revolver from his holster
and levelling it at the tall and
ghostly specter pulled the trigger

  with the shock of the report the
dreadful dream was shattered the
cavern with its ghostly radiance its
fearsome and ghastly dancers and
the threatening specter all had van-
ished wakeford the younger was
back in the tent again staring dum-
founded at his elder brother who
lay bleeding from a bullet wound in
the chest and gasping out his life

  scarcely had the elder wakeford
breathed his last before another shot
rang out the two brothers ended
the journey as they had begun it-
together

as always

            by a leslie

  behold the face that launched a thousand ships
  thus sang the ancient bard of trojan helen

  and the young men gathered

  each to hear and each to dream his chosen dream
  of helen and to give

  her face and form to his own fancy and desire

  for helen lived in many lands-

  and helens hair was softly brown

  and black as dream-clouds and as gold
  as summer sunlight of the dawn

  and helen smiled whereer the night
  strode grandly down the stairway of the stars

  and this was thrice two thousand years agone

  but still the young men gather close to hear
  of trojan helen and to dream their dreams

  for helen lives and troy burns

it was accidental my meeting
the chapmans at tampa i had
been doing florida as most
everybody does at least once had
gone down the east coast and on to
havana in a key west packet i
was now on my way north up the
west side of the peninsula i found
that the real estate sellers of the east
side of that incomparable sand-drift
havent anything on those of the west
side if anybody should ask you

  but the trip had all been different
enough from selling farm machinery
in saskatchewan which was my own
specialty and as i went down the
hotel steps on the way to the railroad
station i carried besides my travel-
ing bag an equally heavy regret that
my week in tampa was up

  a hotel taxi was at the curb and
as i crossed the walk toward it
whom should i almost bump into but
estey chapman and-as i had every
reason to suppose-estelle morse
they had just come out of a shop
chapmans arms laden with pur-
chases and were on the point of
climbing into their car parked in
front of the store

  i must have stood in open-mouthed
nonplus through a heartbeat or so
when  recognized them then my
amazement was swallowed up in our
mutual greetings chapman put me
right in a bashful way when i ad-
dressed estelle as mrs morse

 mrs chapman-now he stam-
mered across his armful of parcels

  they both laughed easily at my

                                   

bo hugh

we could see the bodies
of a youth and a girl
lying in the bottom of
the boat


weird

tales

momentary funk one risks a con-
tretemps or two losing ones self for
years as i had done in the north-
west i had left estelle happily mar-
ried to professor morse-an event
following close on our university as-
sociation-and chapman burning the
midnight electricity trying to break
into print

  youll have to come up to the
house and hear the whole story
chapman said turning to the car to
rid his arms of the parcels

  estelle nodded sweetly in confir-
mation everything estelle did was
done sweetly

    but i was on my way to the sta-
tion man i half objected

  chapman wouldnt listen to me
he waved me into the tonneau seat
with estelle while he sat with the
driver his big back squarely in front
of me chapman was massive he
had played center on the football
team in his last two years at college

  estelle had kept something of her
old-time vivacity but it seemed sub-
dued as though it might have run
the gantlet of no telling what repres-
sive memories she had to my taste
more than ever of brunette loveli-
ness yet she didnt look just fit
somehow and i noticed that chap-
man helped her into the car as
though she were an invalid i
couldnt chaff her as i once would
have done there was some subtle
quality in her manner that stopped
me we talked of the old days but
we did so a little pensively

  the car traversed the citys streets
and its citrus-screened outskirts
coming to a halt at last beside a
sandy plot bordered in the distance
with scrub pines in the midst of
the plot stood the chapman resi-
dence bare and bleak sans veranda
sans stoop and even sans shade trees
it was just a great plain unrelieved
cube with no projections of any
kind about it save the cornices

  i found everything lovely inside
though large brightly lighted rooms
-the lighting was really extraordi-
nary-and the rich furnishings were
of the best and in taste

  youll have a nice place of this
when youve had time to grow some
trees i said to chapman that eve-
ning as we sat outside at sunset
smoking

  we have all the trees we are
likely to have soon

  there was abstraction in the man-
ner of his reply which i thought
presaged the story i knew he had
to tell me i had sensed his attempts
to get a start on it all afternoon and
had wondered what there could be
about it that was so deucedly hard to
tell but if he was at the door of the
thing now he was diverted again for
at the approach of the sudden dusk
of florida latitudes he started up
suddenly with a scared look and an
exclamation that we must go to join
estelle

  we found her in the music room
just seating herself at the piano
something told me that if we had
not come when we did the instru-
ment beneath her hands would have
summoned us a sense of queerness
struck me the instant we entered the
room it was the lights i think all
the electric bulbs in the room and
there were ten times too many were
beaming garishly i suspected chap-
man or his wife of an odd passion for
light light and yet more light as
though gloom or shadow were a
deadly gas that must be kept off

  one of the maids was with estelle
when we entered i noticed that
but she withdrew when we came in
as though she had been there merely
to keep her mistress from being
alone

  estelle played for us until dinner
was announced after dinner the
three of us recalled old friends trac-
ing this or that one to his or her sue-
the mystery of sylmare



cess or failure we went over a lit-
tle of chapmans work a good deal
of it i had never seen though it was
now being published i had been out
of touch with most prints for years

estelle left us at  avowedly
to let us smoke without making
her cough but really i knew quite
well to clear the way for chapmans
disclosures that seemed so hard for
him to disclose the thing he told
me could not have been told with her
present thats certain we went
to chapmans den it was already
bedtime and chapman made no
more false starts

  had morse shown any signs of-
of overstudy before you went
west he asked doubtfully when
we were settled in easy eliairs

 no my answer was prompt
but on his remaining silent i recon-
sidered that is he always
seemed intent on his work when at
work but he was able apparently to
forgot it when away from it

 so he was once chapman
agreed but later on his intensity
at his work grew on him while he
lost entirely his way of letting go of
it when he knocked off finally he
developed a tendency to drag his in-
fernal science into everything that
came up in everyday life that got
to be devilish unpleasant for estelle
and as i seemed the only one who
could fetch him out of it even tem-
porarily they had me about as much
as possible it was estelles doings
but morse wanted me too t think
he felt that he was going a gait
mentally

 his hobby eventually ran to
botany-that is to that phase of bot-
any that considers its relation to
biology in general ho delved into
vegetable sentiency and vegetable
consciousness-can you imagine it
-and even into vegetable mobility
he finally came to more than half

believe that plants have not only
feeling but a kind of mentality or at
least consciousness and at the last
he became next to noisy on the sub-
ject of chlorophyl and its powers

 chapman stopped and stared at
the floor i shook my head at what
he had told me about morse and
wondered meanwhile how much of
the story i was to be cheated out of
by his intimate relation to it

  when morses mother died he
resumed she left him the old home
place in sylmare on the northeast
coast he and estelle used to spend
their vacations there its a sleepy
old town but something of a sum-
mer resort for a few new york and
boston people who like to dodge the
expense or the clatter of the more
popular places theres a writers
and artists summer colony some
eight miles up the coast from syl-
mare and i spent my summers there
what time i wrasnt with the morses
i was there-at the writers roost-
when the thing happened

  it happened in june the morses
had visited estelles people in at-
lanta at the end of the school year
morse going north a week in advance
of his wife to get together a corps of
servants and put the old house in
order estelle never liked mussing
around a house morse telephoned
me on his arrival and i went down
the next day in my motor-boat i
knew that estelle would want me to
be with him as much as i could
while she was not

  i found the house topsyturvy in
the hands of the cleaners to get
away from the dust and litter morse
and i went out for a spin in his car

  the road ran along the foot of a
caveliko forest that covered the hill
it used to be a fancy of morses that
a dweller on some other planet
wholly unacquainted with our forms
of life would on coming to sylmare
be sure to think the trees the real life
of the place and that the people go-


weird tales

ing about beneath them were some
sort of rather unimportant parasitic
form at any rate the gloomy old
town on the sea slope was dark and
dim with the shade of maples
beeches and elms and its steep
streets running down to the shell
road along the beach were very like
grottoes in some half-lit cavern with
sloping floor

  imagine now a lot of men and
women running down those dim
aisles beneath the trees toward the
old wharf on the bayshore and you
have a part of that which brought
our forty mile an hour clip in
morses car to a sudden stop

   somethings gone wrong here
ed i exclaimed turning to morse
as the car slowed up

  i dont think he heard me at all
his face was turned to the wharf
and his vibrant ashen lips were ar-
ticulating its another its an-
other  

  he unlatched the ear door and
jumped out hurrying toward the
wharf i was at his heels the chauf-
feur at mine

 a fishermans rowboat was
drawn up at the wharf and it had
in tow a small motor-boat in the
last as we drew nearer we could
see the bodies of a youth and a girl

   my god morse gasped stop-
ping short and gazing stilly at the
two forms in the boat its frank
kirby and alta cline

  i heard the chauffeur whisper
an oath as we went on toward the
wharf

  the youth and the girl looked
about nineteen or twenty they
were dressed for outing the boy
had on a naval reserve uniform
queerly shot with little pricks and
rents of the fabric and the girls
knickers bore the same strange
marks her bobbed brown hair lay
about her sweet set face like a lovely
soft frame about a picture the
youth had a powder-smoked bullet-

hole in his right temple and the girl
bore a wound quite like it the queer-
est thing of all however was the
great number of scratches and slight
wounds on their faces their hands
and their wrists

   the ellis boys were like that
i heard a woman near me whisper to
another

   mrs van scoyk too the other
answered with a straight wild look
and barry also i heard

 the coroner came pushing
through the crowd about the wharf
his examination disclosed nothing
we had not already seen save a re-
volver with two empty chambers ly-
ing in the bottom of the boat he
gave directions for the removal of
the bodies as they carried the girl
out of the boat one of her dead
drooping hands still grasped and
carried a small bag of fir tips such
as are used for stuffing aromatic pil-
lows eyes filled at that sight
somehow that was the most pa-
thetic thing about the whole solemn
scene

  i turned to morse for an explan-
ation but he shook his head at my
questioning look and led the way si-
lently to the group about the fisher-
man who had brought in the boats
and was now telling and retelling
his story

   i was bout seven miles down
coast when i see their boat driftin
out to sea engine dead and nobody
rowin i could see em layin as you
saw em here they was so still that
i rowed up to em toyin to make
out what was wrong but when i
got near enough to see them
scratches on their faces i went weak
as a cat for i saw the ellis boys
and barry too it was all i could
do to nerve myself up to towin em
in he shook his head and started
up the beach

   you had no means of judging
how far they had drifted morse
the mystery of sylmare



asked as we walked beside the man
toward the road

   no but i saw em leave the
wharf this morning they was gay
as two kids then is it so they was
to be married next fall

   yes its true i believe morse
replied gravely following me to the
car

   what in the name of heaven do
you make of this ed i asked as
our machine moved away

  he shook his head silently

     but what did they mean-about
the ellis boys and barry

   its a long story-too long to
tell here his eyes were on the
driver meaningly i didnt know
then as he did that every servant in
the town was already on the verge
of pulling up stakes and leaving be-
cause of this strange deadly thing
that was killing people right and left
among them true these two latest
victims had evidently killed them-
selves  but everyone seemed sure
that it was the thing that had
brought it about

   lets go home morse suggest-
ed i dont feel in the mood for a
drive now

  i nodded assent and he gave the
order to the driver

txhen we got back to the house
v v we found the library at least
out of the hands of the dusters and
went into it morse was moody it
seemed an effort for him to begin the
disclosures i felt he had brought me
there to make

   in the first place he began at
last when he saw that i couldnt or
wouldnt talk of anything else the
two victims you saw at the wharf
just now are merely the latest of a
long series though ill admit that
they have affected me more than has
any of the others because of their
carefree youth and their promise of
life and love and happiness but i
know of six such cases directly and

indirectly of a number of others
they are all without a parallel-that
i can find-in human experience 

  i shivered and shook my head
moving my chair nearer to his in the
great gloomy library

   the first of the more recent
cases he went on was that of mrs
van scoyk you didnt know the
van scoyks

   i never heard the name until
today it was whispered then

   they summered here or rather
she did van scoyk ran out from
the city usually friday nights go-
ing back mondays she went in for
boating she was in fact an expert
with thef oars

  i was away when the van
scoyk affair happened it was last
summer mrs van scoyk had been
out on the bay in her rowboat to-
ward evening a passing boatman
saw her leap from the shore into the
water this mind you was in sight
of her splendid summer home on the
north bluff she had everything to
live for the van scoyks were
wealthy

   it came out at the inquest that
several of her acquaintances had
passed her as she rowed up the bay
on her way home but she paid not
the slightest attention to any of their
greetings she seemed dull and
dazed-dead alive as one witness ex-
pressed it

   the boatman raced to her to
get her out of the water calling an
alarm as he did so but she could not
be revived she was dead on the
beach near by was her boat and in
the deep sand near the waterside she
had molded with her hands a shal-
low grave on which sheiad placed a
bouquet of wild flowers

   now comes the strangest part
of this strange case mrs van
scoyks clothing was all pricked and
torn and her face and hands were
covered with mysterious scratches
and small wounds like those of the


weird

tales

two you just now saw at the wharf

i suppose you noticed that detail

  noticed it i was so struck
with it that i saw little else-save
the bag of fir tips

   the fir tips    yes that is
   something morse had evi-
dently forgotten my presence for the
moment and was staring at the floor
in deep thought

   i have studied closely three of
the five cases that have occurred
since that of mrs van scoyk he
went on coming out of his abstrac-
tion the ellis boys-you heard
gibbs mention them-were two lads
of twelve and fourteen they too
were drowned they had been out
clamming but had come in and had
tied up their boat in its usual place
even at that their death must have
been attributed to accident but for
the fact that when their bodies wrerc
recovered their faces hands and
clothes bore those same strange
marks foul play of some queer
crazy kind was suspected i looked
for the affair to get into the head-
lines of the metropolitan press but
it didnt

  the barry case happened
shortly afterward barry was a
bachelor who lived with his unmar-
ried sister about half a mile up the
coast he was a farmer a close-
fisted one who wanted his own and a
man who apparently hadnt a
thought above his meager daily sav-
ings but barry had one weakness-
fishing he had spent the whole of
the day of his death somewhere on
the bay fishing plenty of people
saw him rowing home at nightfall
but he stared straight ahead in the
same half-dead way that mrs van
scoyk had done answering the hail
of no one

   well barry never reached
home that is he reached the prem-
ises but not the house his sister
hearing a shot ran out to the barn-
lot where she found him dying he

had shot himself with a small rifle
which he kept at the barn for killing
rats now listen barrys face and
hands and clothes bore the same queer
marks that the others had borne

  if morse meant to impress me he
succeeded i sat staring from the
library window into the gloom be-
neath the shrubbery without almost
as still and breathless as those forms
i had seen lifted from the boat
when i at last looked up morse
went on speaking

   but of all the victims of this
mysterious baffling thing those of
today are the most touching they
were at the brink of lifes sweetest
period the mating time there was
no opposition to their love affair i
am as sure as one can be of anything
almost that there was not a cloud in
their sky when briggs saw them
leave the wliarf this morning

   in gods name ed what can it
be i cried out springing up to pace
the floor

  he shook his head not one
word has anyone ever heard any of
them speak between what happened
-if anything happened-and their
death

   their wounds suggest-a fight
with some bird or beast i hazarded

  he looked at the floor in thought
i cant think it he replied at last
raising his gaze to mine the
scratches are superficial and there
seems no sign of the claw or talon
about them

   has no search of the vicinity
been made

   no its been talked of but-
well for what would one search in a
case of this kind

  that silenced me for the mo-
ment

   but that is not the real reason a
search has not been made he went
on theres the danger that a
search would result in-more fatali-
ties 
the mystery of sylmare



   im willing to risk it i ven-
tured grimly

   not alone he objected star-
tled by my remark

   well with a party then

  a party would be hard to
handle hard to control it would
destroy more evidence than it gath-
ered besides a party would look-
silly when you dont know what
youre hunting for a still hunt
would be better

  i took that as a sort of a chal-
lenge ill go with you if you like
i said

   when

  i considered i had an unfin-
ished article overdue and an idle
typist up at the colony drawing pay
while she flirted with no telling
which one of the other scribblers or
dabblers

   would the day after- tomorrow
do i asked

   perfectly i have all the time
there is

  he had become laconic but i
could see that he was still tense and
nervous to relieve the strain i
asked these other cases you men-
tioned outside of those you have
looked into where did you learn of
them  

   in the files of the local news-
paper i went to the bottom of the
entire moldy heap fifty-four years
a fire had destroyed everything up
to  he was walking the floor
now his eyes gleaming like those of
an ecstatic

   what did you find in the files
i demanded

   i found eleven mysterious
deaths in the fifty-four years he
hurled at me stopping short in his
uneasy prance across the floor too
many for one small town he added
i found too that all but one of them
happened in summer and they all
exhibited a strangely identical lack
of cause four of the eleven are
known to have borne the strange

wounds we have seen and i suspeet
that three of the others did their
bodies were never recovered from the
bay four of the eleven went in
pairs and were fishermen without i
should say a thought above their
daily catch

   theres something deadly ab-
normal about it ed i mused aloud
peering at the floor

   yes-if the extremely rare or
possibly the unique is-abnormal
he countered

  he plainly was at his theorizing
again and i thought i might as well
go to the bottom of it you have-
an idea about it ed i half asked

  he hesitated standing with one
foot on a chair to gaze gloomily
through a window nothing credi-
ble estey he replied at last noth-
ing that i would care to advance
even to you

  there was but one thought in
either of our minds im sure when
i left him a few minutes later and
that was our pioposed search for a
thing that i at least hadnt the
least idea of what we were searching
for he intended no publicity no
unnecessary risk no self-sacrifice at
that time im sure of that

chapman took up a cut-glass de-
canter from the desk beside us
and went into a tiny lavatory just
off the den for a turn of fresh water
it was a hot night as he came out
of the lavatory he snapped a switch
and i saw the lights in the library
go out

  theyre all in bed he said
theres no use having the place lit
up like a power house  

  we drank some of the water and
chapman lit another cigar i had
had enough of smoking

  morse intended to play square
chapman resumed i am positive
of that but when my telephone bell
rang at an unearthly hour of the
morning we were to go on our search


weird tales

i knew that something had gone awry
i got up and went to the instrument
its metallic whine as aloof and im-
personal as though it was giving out
the weather forecast let me know
that a milkman early astir had found
morse sitting at a raised window of
his study dead

  i threw on my clothes and ran
out to tje boathouse i had a key
there was a line of daylight low in
the northeast but no one was up it
was supposed to be a fifteen minute
run to sylmare but i must have
jerked the painter through a stay-
ring in the old wharf at the foot of
the town in ten minutes at the most

  early as it was a crowd of towns-
folk had gathered outside the win-
dow of morses study when i arrived
they fell back in whispering groups
beneath the trees as i entered the
gate naturally morses death fol-
lowing so close on that of frank kir-
by and alta cline had fallen on them
with cumulative effect they were
awed in the dim light under the
trees they looked as might a group of
primitive men huddled in the face
of some unknown mysterious danger

  i approached the window slowly
iind in extreme dread stopping short
when i reached it to stare fixedly
into eds face as at the medusa it
bore the baffling marks i was now
iamiliar with the marks i had seen
on the youth and the girl in the boat

  it was a moment between-him
and me not pleasant those rare mo-
ments alone with the dead i dont
know whether death really adds
weight to what one has said or be-
lieved or advocated before dying
but i do know that my mind brushed
nearer morses queer theory while i
was standing there before his stark
body than ever before

  under the spell of his dead pres-
ence i watched a green worm meas-
ure its laborious way along the sill of
ihe open window between us watched
it rear its forward length in air

pause an instant then bring up its
trailing rear as though it were a
dragged burden

  the worm brought to my mind
one of morses favorite arguments
that its kind are a significant con-
necting link between the two great
divisions of life animals and plants
its imperfect mobility relating it to
the one and its green color pointing
plainly to the other he believed
that its alternate movement of first
one part of its body and then the
other was due to its scant dole of
mobile energy sufficient only to ani-
mate half its body at a time

  i turned from the window and
went into the house everything
was just as it had been the last time
i saw him-everything but ed him-
self the familiar appointments of
the study the books on their shelves
the writing machine on its stand the
pens gleaming dully in their wire
holder seemed only to accentuate the
dead mans inability to move he
was now like them-inert somehow
they brought out the fact subtly
that he was still all there except that
mysterious quality called conscious-
ness with its accompanying parallel
the power to move

  there were two doctors in the
town and they were both there in
the room i knew knowles and he
introduced me to eberslee - in a
whisper imagine a doctor whisper-
ing over the dead it shows what the
thing had done to us-to all of us
the coroner hadnt yet been called

   we can make nothing of it dr
knowles whispered meaning clearly
the cause of morses act there was
no mystery about the cause of his
death or rather of the means of it
his lips were burned and an empty
glass on the writing desk smelled of
acid

   he seems much like the others
knowles went on but- he hesi-
tated looked at eberslee then back
the mystery of sylmare



at me you probably wouldnt know
of-

   yes i know i interrupted
morse told me himself he-we
were-interested in the other cases

    we guessed that eberslee inter-
posed thats why we telephoned
you that and these he left these
written sheets for you he crossed
the room to the writing machine
stand and lifted a paperweight from
a few pages of manuscript

  i took up the sheets of paper
gingerly there wasnt a reason un-
der the blue sky why i should take
these two doctors into my confidence
in the matter of morses last words
to me but such was my immeasura-
ble interest and theirs no thought
of any other course ever entered any
of our heads i think we tiptoed
from the study into the old parlor as
cautiously as though we feared the
contents of the precious sheets might
be jeopardized by a heavy footfall
grouped at a window for light we
read the dimly penned pages hand-
ing them from one to another as we
read  

chapman left off speaking and
leaned over the writing desk be-
fore him he unlocked a drawer and
took out of it a size  white envel-
lope i felt goofy-felt definitely on
the verge of an ordeal the taboo of
the cerements was about the thing
chapman held in his hand it was
getting an ugly time of night and
the house was still as a crypt from
off somewhere a pensive chorus of
frogs reached us faintly while nearer
at hand without the screened win-
dows the whine of baffled mosquitos
haunted the night

  estelle doesnt know i kept this
chapman said slipping the rubber
band off the envelope she thinks
i burned it she has a horror of it
and with reason it very nearly sent
her after morse

  i took the thing when he held it

out i had steeled myself to take it
while he was fussing with it i sus-
pect that he noticed my reluctance-
my nervousness at any rate he
took up a book as i unfolded the
manuscript and read

my dear estey

  i hope you will forgive my going
alone on the search we had planned
when i tell you it resulted wholly
from an accident the turning up of
an old old book by the house-clean-
ers in their work i came across it
soon after you left yesterday it
gave me a lead that was irresistible
i simply could not wait you will
believe that i deeply regret grieving
estelle and you but the riddle drew
me as a magnet draws metal i
guess you know why

  at the outset i want to warn you
against the tendency of the human
mind to dismiss as incredible and
unworthy of serious consideration
the exceedingly strange or the
unique it is a grave fault or limi-
tation rather of our mentality
since the mind itself is no more than
a set of comparisons of known forms
it is at ease and satisfied only among
the known and comparable the un-
like and the unfamiliar confuse and
offend it the series of mysterious
cases which will-i have made sure
of that-culminate with my own
death may be merely the result of
prenomena as definite and once we
know them as commonplace as
gravity or the electric current once
the laughing stock of incredulous
minds

  i have long had more than an
inkling of the nature of the fell en-
tity i set myself the task of bringing
to light when i left sylmare this
morning i knew fairly well what i
was looking for my problem was
chiefly one of where to look for it
and in that i had one governing
clue that is all the victims of this
deadly enemy of our kind which i


weird tales

was seeking liad apparently reached
it by means of boats one of the
victims too had also brought away
probably from the place i sought a
bag of fir tips this fact seemed to
me of some significance since fir is
not a universal growth hereabouts

  then as if arranged by fate
came the finding of the old book it
was an odd volume of the colonial
period containing a legend which
assigned a haunted island to our bay
an island that the redmen who had
lived here for centuries could in no
wise be induced to visit i assumed-
that the tradition had something to
do with the present mystery

  with these premises i set out in
a rowboat before daybreak reaching
the island directly east of sylmare
soon after daylight on it i found
no fir in fact this island is very
sparsely wooded and i gave little
time to it rowing southward i
came to the second island at  in
the morning it is more densely
wooded with a sprinkling of fir
among its pines but though i spent
upwards of an hour exploring it i
found nothing unusual about it

  leaving this island i continued
my course southward the morning
was now far spent and i began to
feel that perhaps i had embarked on
a fools errand when suddenly i felt
a strong presentiment come over me
and i immediately fell under the
guidance of that ancient monitor of
the race intuition as i approached
the third island to the southward i
felt strangely assured that some-
where within its wooded depths i
would find the lair of the unnamable
object of my search

  this island is not greatly differ-
ent from the others i had visited ex-
cept that it is heavily wooded
throughout its extent it is not
large and has the general contour
of an ellipse at its southern extrem-
ity there is a rocky headland the ex-
treme point of the promontory being

occupied by a strangely sharp and
slender pinnacle of rock undermined
by the beating sea until it seems to
point to the sun at noonday this
singular formation and the deep
gloom beneath the woods of the
island lent it a distinctly weird and
eery aspect

  when i entered the dark wood
after beaching the boat i had to
stoop and creep to avoid the thickets
of dead branches that clothed the
lower portions of all the trees as

i	penetrated deeper and ever deeper
into the deathlike stillness of the for-
est the darkness became as dense as
that of a dimly lit cave a great
loneliness depressed me as i stopped
from time to time and stood in the
vast dim silence tensely listening to
the beating of my own heart

  the sense of guidance that had
taken possession of me in the boat
still had me in its keeping  my
course through the wood was in no
sense a search rather it was a toil-
some passage to a definite point
which a strange assurance told me i
would neithen fail to find nor fail to
know when i came to it

   i at last ran onto a small circular
rift in the forest and stopped on its
verge as suddenly as though it had
been a precipice the weird gloom
that hung above the carpet of dead
pine needles in the wood here broke
into a half-light that was like a thick
mist in color and opaqueness though
it was high noon not a ray of sun-
light penetrated either the forest or
the rift by which i stood strangely
moved as if at some hellish shrine

i	sank to the ground with my back
against a tree

  i glanced down at my hands
they were scratched and bleeding
from tiny wounds made by the sharp
points of dead branches with which
they had come in contact i could
feel similar abrasions on my face
already i bore the uncanny sign
with which the evil genius of this
the mystery of sylmare



baleful death spot marked its vic-
tims 

  my eyes fell on two slight inden-
tations in the thick bed of pine
needles under a double tree at my
feet between the two depressions
in the litter lay a little heap of fir
boughs from which the tips had been
removed it was the discard from
alta clines pillow i knew from
that if from nothing else that i had
found the thing i sought

  the trees about the rift were very
old with knotted gnarled and mis-
shapen trunks their dead lower
branches gleaming like whitened
bones through the gray light of the
place and surmounted by their green
tops suggested life superimposed on
death ever growing ever dying

 while i was musing on this
thought i became conscious of a
sound it was like the self-made mur-
mur one hears in the silence of a
cavern but seemed to come from the
tipper part of the rift as though the
sound of the sea by some freak of
acoustics was caught and repeated
by the mystic cleft in the forest the
soft mill-like murmur had come
creeping on my senses unawares but
once i had taken note of it i was
never afterward able to disregard it

  the sense of isolation was appal-
ling the gloom of the wood and the
gray of the rift cast a deep depression
on me and in the pulseless monotone
that filled the place there was all the
haunting sadness of the night winds
moan

  the voice of the forest mans
earliest lullaby has ever affected
him deeply imbuing him with relig-
ious fervor abasing him in awe and
fear the druids oak with its pray-
ers and sacrifice the africans hal-
lowed fetish-wold the sylvan shrine
of the south sea savage-all are
remnants of an ancient kinship be-
tween man and tree that still appeals
through the subtle and desuete
avenues of the soul
w t-

  but i attribute the unique power
this strange spot on the island pos-
sessed to a much older kinship a
brotherhood dating clear back to
lifes dim beginnings when the ani-
mal and vegetable forms were iden-
tical in their common ancestry to
me this vengeful death-trap seems
nothing less than the ruing on the
part of the trees that constitute it
of an old old bargain an ancient
covenant tacitly made by first life
when the materials it found here re-
quired a division of method for their
utilization and the primitive forms
drew apart into two classes the
plants remaining fixed and insen-
tient securing their sustenance in
one spot the animal forms develop-
ing mobility in their search for food
along with its parallel consciousness

  it is a sure thing that each of
these divisions of life still retains in
suppressed form the characteristics
of the other-rather of its own dis-
used half plants retain the sex char-
acter while many animals are sex-
less  the fungus remains in one spot
yet feeds by alimentation some ani-
mals have lost their power of move-
ment have vegetated while others
possess the leafs power of direct
fixation of carbon man highest of
all animals loses both sentiency and
volition in catalepsy and kindred
states while insectivorous plants
have clearly developed both mobility
and consciousness

thus i could go on at great
length to convince you that the at-
tributes of animal life merely slum-
ber in the plant and that they often
are reawakened no rational ex-
planation of the woods spell pre-
sents itself save that the old trees
on the verge of the rift during the
centuries of arrested growth forced
on them by a sterile soil had devoted
their idle eons to developing their
sleeping consciousness that they
though defeated in their efforts to
attain mobility itself had yet


 weird tales



achieved preternaturally some meas-
ure of mobilitys parallel mentality
or at least a weird power of sugges-
tion which they were able to employ
in a strange telepathic way on such
as fell into their gray and terrible
web

  as a pitcher-plant lies in wait for
its prey these misshapen monsters
of the vegetable world awaited their
victims the chief accessory by
which they conveyed their deadly
virus of depression to the minds of
their prey was the gray rift in the
forest this was like a seers crys-
tal in which floated dimly the entire
flux of being from incandescent
world birth to dead orb whirling in
darkness the vast wthole appearing
in a condensed brevity that wras like
the fall of a yellowred leaf it wras
a cinematograph of eternity itself
staggering-yes fatal-to any mere
mote of humanity whose eyes fell on
the screen

  the infinite perspective one got
on gazing into the mistlike void wras
paralyzing and its endless parade of
living forms made consciousness and
movement appear an unending pun-
ishment an unfinishable task like
the doom of sisyphus the inert and
somnolent vegetable at rest and in-
capable of suffering seemed to have
fallen on a better lot than had its
cousin the animal the latter ever
prodded with the impulse to do to
keep going appeared to be playing
the clowns part in the pageant of
being

 such was the sophistry with
which the enormity of the island
poisoned the minds of its victims the
while it sapped them of their will
and wish to live and i am con-
vinced that this gloom-girt upas of
the wood had learned through the
centuries a cunning that guided it in
the adaptation of its subtle propa-
ganda to the mind of every being
savage or civilized learned or illit-

 erate child or adult who came
within its deadly spell

ttow long i sat peering into the
a a mistlike void of the rift i do
not know i was aroused from the
torpor that lay on me by the fall of
a dead branch from a tree at my
side i started up shaking as with a
palsy the place had grown almost
pitch-dark the returning tide of
animation and love of life flushed
through me and sent me fleeing
wildly from the spot

  i ran through the wood scarcely
checking my half-mad course to feel
my way among the dead branches
that wounded me in the darkness i
crashed out of the tangle at some
distance from the boat and as i
walked along the beach toward it i
felt the spell of the rift which i had
momentarily thrown off settle back
on me i heard again its inescapable
monotone of sound i then recog-
nized the activity that had carried
me away from the spot as the mere
reaction of a wounded spirit the re-
flex shrinking of sentiency from a
blow

  deeply depressed i approached
the boat and stood beside it in
thought the lapping sea crooned a
low accompaniment to the ceaseless
sound that was in my ears it was
nightfall an early star twinkled in
the east and as i gazed at it ab-
sently i found my imagination peo-
pling its unseen satellites with the
appalling infinity of living forms i
had reviewed at the rift

  i grew cold a tremor like that
of a chill shook me and i reached
for my coat which i had left in the
boat as i was about to put it on
an idea was suggested to me by the
sight of a match-case that fell from
one of its pockets catching up the
little silver box i ran back to the
wood and crept a little way into the
underbrush

  i struck a match and touched it
the mystery of sylmare



to the layer of pine needles -on the
ground i was startled as the flames
leaped up in the dark thicket and
plunging out of the wood and across
the beach i leaped into the boat
as though pursued by an embodied
spirit of the island and pushed hast-
ily away front the shore

  the litter on the ground and the
dry lower branches of the trees fed
the are like an inflammable oil and
soon the entire wood was a mass of
flames beneath above which the
green treetops writhed like a tor-
tured multitude the upflare of the
flames lighting the level sea fell on
me with a glare like that of the blaz-
ing eyes of a monster dying in rage
as i rowed swiftly away from the
accursed island

  two hours later i landed at the
old abandoned wharf south of town
made my way home unseen and at
once set about this task-which is
to be my last

  i apprehend that my theory in
this matter will encounter unlimited
skepticism and i grant that certain
of my predilections may have made
me overcredulous with such as
take this view of it i will have no
quarrel but i suggest that they ex-
plore the fields of natural suggestion
and impression there is a much
broader and more potent foice in
this quaiter t am sure than has yet
been uncovered that definite and
effective impression whether elating
or depressive is a faculty of certain
aspects of nature is well known and
i am quite sure that whether or not
the deadly spot on the island was
conscious was capable of volition
the element of suggestion was a po-
tent factor in its fell spell

co the amazing message ended
 there were no farewell clauses
not even a signature as though the
burden of mere existence had sud-
denly become more than the writer
could bear and he had simply quit-

quit writing and quit living in-
deed the last lines of the script had
grown weak and indistinct as
though the writers power to think
had outlasted his power to move the
pen across the page the last of the
writing trailed off into an illegible
scrawl a mere meaningless trail
across the paper-like the track of a
crawling worm

  chapman looked up from his book
when i laid the sheets on the desk
but he remained silent forcing me to
speak first

  of all the- i stopped for

want of a fitting word with which to
express my opinion

  you think so

  there was a tentativeness in his
inflection that might mask either de-
fense or derision of morses madness

  and i thought you stupidly sane
estey i exclaimed

  he smiled well im not going
to do anything about it whether
morse was right or wrong in fact
theres nothing to do about it but
theres more to his theory than you
think ive put the thing up to men
who ought to know and they all con-
cede that morses premises have
weight but none of them of course
would follow him to his conclusions
even the great sundberg was inter-
ested though he finally labeled it a
case of a man finding what he started
out to find whether it was there or
not that is he felt that morses bias
had led him to his conclusions
oddly enough considine was the
kindest one among them you knew
-or did you know-considine he
must have joined the staff about the
time you went west

  i knew him i thought there was
a sort of a feud-professional jeal-
ousy or the like-between him and
morse

  there was but considines ill
will stopped at the grave he met
morses theory more than half-way
went into bergson farther than i


weird tales

could follow him and finished with
that old saw about the poorhouse or
the asylum being the only place for
the man in advance of his times

  but the other victims i ex-
ploded how do you-how does
anyone-account for them  they
hadnt morses predilections

 oh theres no mystery about
them except their number even
their mimber is nearly or quite
equaled by a few other famous death
spots in this queer world why
man one of the most ill-famed of
them all is no more than blocks i
should say from the headquarters of
your own beloved harvester trust
in the rotunda of a skyscraper what
are its wire nettings but a tangible
acknowledgment of its deadly spell
and how many victims had it
claimed before the wire was put up

  morse was right enough in his
second guess it is a form of sug-
gestion that does it-depressive sug-
gestion it is exactly as though mel-
ancholia were a communicable dis-
ease and this spot on the island a
carrier of it and a carrier able to
give the malady to everyone who
came near there are a number of
places in the world that are known
to be fatal to certain people the
one at sylmare differed from the
others only in that it was fatal to all
it was one lmndred per cent efficient

  great waterfalls high cliffs and
even desert wastes possess this de-
pressing power as do high bridges
and lofty domes its the perspec-
tive that does it as morse suspected
it puts you under a reversed micro-
scope-makes you little you may
be sure that ive gone to the bottom
of this thing and you can take it
from me that any view which gives
us that crushing realization of our
infinite unimportance to the whole
is not good for us we must remain
unconscious of the whole and espe-
cially must we be able to disregard
duration no man can live merely

waiting for the next instant and
that was the peculiar doom of the
island it set its victims counting
the spokes in eternitys wheel

  how did-estelle take it all i
asked to break the uneasy silence
that fell on us my question sounded
crass enough but i wasnt quick
enough to stop it once i had set it
going

  chapman hesitated she hasnt
got over it yet entirely but she
will the mistake was in letting her
see this at all he tapped the
folded message in his hand but
what was i to do her father and
her married sister had come on from
atlanta with her and i put it up to
them they wanted she should see
it we none of us felt that we could
withhold sueh a thing from her
what we failed to take into account
was her knowledge of the  other
cases and of morses work on
them

  chapman sat staring at the desk-
top estelle came nearer believing
morses theory than has anyone else
she was a nervous wreck for awhile
afraid of her own shadow-and of
all other shadows strangely or not
she clung to me i had been through
much of it with her she had been
away from her own people except
for brief visits so long that i was
really nearer to her than they were
the upshot of it all was that i mar-
ried her after a decent time her
folks wanted that too they are a
sensible lot

  we spent a long time getting her
out of it travel wouldnt do we
tried that it led us into too many
suggestive surroundings too many
gloom spots you wouldnt think
that just a flowing stream-or any
steady movement or sound-would
so upset anyone the sea too is
taboo she cant bear the sight nor
sound of it nor the shade of trees
nor even the shade of a porch that
is why we have neither- trees nor
the mystery of sylmare



porch here the steady roar of wind
in a grove would drive her to mad-
ness in twenty-four hours

  so we at last found this spot and
settled down we are so far from
the bay that you wouldnt know it
was there yet near enough to the
city to avoid isolation    but if
i have given you in all this an im-
pression of being burdened-

  i stopped him short with a reas-
suring gesture i could honestly do
that estelle in any state of nerves
could never be a burden to any man
t recalled the thrill i had got from
the pressure of her soft cool hand at
our greetings saw again her superb
figure at the piano its loveliness sug-
gested where it was not revealed by
the tight and loose set of the becom-
ing house dress she wore she was
so eminently desirable so full of
warm pulsing life that i could not
ward off the thought that whatever
professor morse might have done for
sylmare or for science he had done
estey chapman an immeasurably
good turn

  t sat in silence thinking the deep
stillness of the great dark rooms that
opened upon the den pressing in on
me like a physical presence to get
away from the eery feeling i asked
what kind of a stir did this thing
kick up in sylmare

  it kicked up none if you mean
this chapman replied reaching for
the envelope and putting the folded
sheets back into it they know
nothing of this up there the coro-
ner didnt get within rods of it i
saw to that the whole affair
would be almost forgotten in the
course of time in sylmare if it
hadnt left a reminder-a monument
the island is there yet i rowed out
and took a look at it naturally
eberslee went with me we went at
night to avoid talk and perhaps a
following of the curious

  the island lies black and desolate
on the horizon of passing boatmen
its stony surface thick set with the
blackened boles of the burned pines
still standing there isnt a living
beast bird or bush on it-the most
deserted spot on earth i wouldnt
want to-it isnt a nice place to
be on a moonless night with the dull
faces of the rocks staring dimly at
the stars and the night breeze from
off the lapping surf strumming the
low haunting voices of the standing
dead

  chapman seldom was eloquent
and i sat abashed at this peroration
of his in the deep silence that fol-
lowed it we heard again the lonely
cry of frogs in the distance the
weird wail of mosquitos in the dark-
ness without
a tale of dire occult evil

the edge of the
shadow

 by r ernest dupuy

that you should believe this
would be remarkable i have
no explanation limited knowl-
edge i have and hearsay for the rest
the hearsay at first i did not believe
but when the man who lifted the cur-
tain had gone west-and he was a
hard-headed soldier man-i won-
dered for his going when one takes
everything into consideration fitted
in and to that at least i can bear
witness

  we were lying in our dugout at
romagne waiting for zero hour out-
side fritzs counter preparation was
messing things up considerably
through an instants lull came the
long-drawn howl of a dog-if it was
a dog and something scratched and
slithered against the sturdy logs of
our shelter a spray of shrapnel
perhaps

  its calling me was all that he
said

  i can still see his face and the quiz-
zical lift of his eyebrows in the glare
of our gasoline lantern-we were mo-
torized artillery and did things in
style and as i returned his stare
his yarn forgotten for two years
came back

  he had to go out a few minutes later
to check up data at the guns and
when we found him in the dawning
a splinter-or something-had ripped
away his throat nothing else but
even now when a dog gives dismal
tongue in the quiet of the night i feel


my hackles rise and the ice creep up
my backbone and i wonder

  it was a book that had made him
open up to me in the first place-a
book called dracula ever read it
no well sometime when you want
a good crawly chill look it over he
noticed it on the shelf one night when
he had dropped in at my quarters for
a chat some time before we went into
the war and he asked me what i
thought of it he didnt pay much
attention to my opinion i guess but
sat there sucking his pipe and nod-
ding while i talked and then he
said

  ive scraped against the edge of
that stuff just the edge its not so
good

  now he wasnt at all the type of
man that one would link up with that
sort of yarn and for that reason it
made all the more impression on me
he didnt attempt any explanation
either just told it as it struck him
and do not get the idea that he was
boasting of his conquest i didnt
know the girl never would know her
and we had been friends too long for
him to fear that i might blab his
thoughts had just come to a boil i
imagine looking at the book and
bringing back the thing so he had to
get it out of his system

  it seems that he had met her in a
casual way but first glance had been
like fire to tow headlong they went
into it with open eyes a well-matched
the edge of the shadow



pair she must have been a wonder
a russian with all the slavic grasp
of the ars amandi one moment all fire
and passion the next an iceberg a
thoroughbred too gone wrong if
you will but always a thoroughbred
and he-was my friend not that he
elaborated on their adventure i sim-
ply filled in in my minds eye the
brief bold outline he blocked out

phe climax came one night when
- they were riding they had had
several nocturnal prowls on horse-
back i gathered brief intervals of
dalliance this night they took a
trail that was new to both imagine
them jogging side by side the august
moon rising over the treetops throw-
ing the masses of foliage into deep re-
lief great blocks of velvet blackness
against the cloudless sky about them
fields shining silver in the moonlight

  the shadows swallowed them up as
the trail twisted into the woods the
man leading his white-shirted back
gleaming vaguely to the woman fol-
lowing close the horses picking their
way up hill and down through
brush and trees the trail ran now
sloping upward on hillsides whose
inky depths defied the faint moon-
light  now plunged in woodland pock-
ets i could feel the gloom that closed
them in as he talked a tangible thing
seemingly ever surrounding yet ever
giving way before their advance un-
til at last they broke through to a
moonlit plateau and cantered to-
gether over the swelling ridges to
draw rein on the very crest of the
cliff

  below them the lowlands spread in
tawny languor till they touched the
silver-flashing edge of the moon-swept
sea on the horizon behind them the
swale of plateau ran clear to the cur-
tain of the woods

  and then he said they decided to
explore farther again they entered
the woods-this time a clump of trees

guarded by a fringe of stunted deso-
late-looking deadwood and some-
how the air felt different there was
a chill and dankness about it he had
not noticed in the other woods the
girl shivered up a slight incline and
then into the open again and on their
right a dark mass-the gloomy pile of
a deserted house its empty windows
black leering dead eyes the moon-
light heaping fantastic shadows about
its front and through the ruins of
what had once been a noble porte-
cochere a bit of broken pane in one
of the lower windows flickered eerily
in the moon-rays the girl brought
her animal close to his her eyes
shielded with one hand as she passed
the house with averted head

  whats the matter dear he
joked afraid that you will see the
goblins holding carnival inside

  but she only cowered closer in the
saddle and that was so odd so dif-
ferent from her usual bold demeanor
that it chilled him and then some-
thing vague unformed brushed be-
tween them he felt it touch his
boot he said

  the girl screamed the horses
plunged and she wheeled -her beast
crowding the man into the brush as
she spurred past him he followed
only to see her throw her horse once
more upon its haunches as she turned
again squarely in front of the house
and the thought passed through his
mind of the house as a finite being
an unclean object squatting there in-
side its circle of blasted trees

  he rode up beside her as she sat
with staring eyes and heaving breasts
and to his question she answered sim-
ply-

  it is the end she said

  and then her mood changed and
her lips sought his and covered them
with voluptuotis kisses

  dismount she whispered i
could see the perspiration gather on
his forehead as he told this part al-
though his voice never changed


weird tales

  dismount she coaxed again
and her lips caressed his throat her
arms were about him now as they
pressed closely the horses jammed
against one another

  we are going in there together
dear boy and the white teeth
touched his flesh and through him
passed a wave of pure terror

 im damned if we are he
snapped and tearing himself loose
snatched at her bridle and urged the
horses into a gallop he didnt re-
member how they got out he said
the horses must have found the way
all he remembered was a rush
through the restraining underbrush
the girl sobbing as they went until at
last they broke through to the high
road and sanity

  that night she told him her story
told him with his arms about her
and lie quivered now and then at the
telling and once as a dog howled
somewhere in the distance he pushed
her from him for a moment she un-
derstood and laughed though the
tears were close beneath

  she was twelve she said when the
terror first came to her in her home
on the dniester almost in the shadow
of the carpathians-a feudal hold
whose foundations went back to time
immemorial one wing was forbidden
territory blocked off from the rest
of the old castle it was with its own
tiny court the only entrance a door
giving from the east tower to the
courtyard the gatekeeper old por-
tal was the only human she had ever
seen go through its entrance

  playing with her jacks one after-
noon she found the courtyard door
open and with the curiosity of a child
overcoming the strict injunction had
slipped in

  it was late and the rays of the set-
ting sun were striking the massive
tower door sitting on the lintel she
idly threw the jackstones against the
oak deeper the shadows grew except

for one bright spot at the height of a
mans head where the sunlight
struck once again she carelessly
tossed the jacks against the door
there was a rattle and stir inside and
with a creaking groan the door swung
inward and the child found herself
staring at something that lurked and
mewed in the opaque shadow star-
tled she rose to her feet and it rose
too and stood with head and shoul-
ders framed in the light of the dying
sun gazing down on her

  terror froze the girl for through
the dusk she could see the body-the
body of the thing that should not
have been and she cowered there
it bent toward her and she felt her-
self picked up in arms that were not
human crushed against a form not
human while the face that was hu-
man but should not have been blew
its fetid breath upon her in a voice
rasping and metallic like no human
voice it spoke in a horrid unforget-
table monotone that thrilled and bit
deep into her brain

  you have come to me of your own
free will you have called me again
will i come to you and yet again
and you shall belong to me body and
soul to do my bidding for the ages
and ages to come

  one arm forced the girls head
back passing over her neck in a
dreadful caress the face bent over
her throat the slavering lips touched
her skin the pointed teeth pressed
against her flesh came one shriek of
terror from her and then oblivion

  she was sixteen when she met the
terror again riding through the
woods near garenstein with her
cousin ivan the pair of them madly
in love she had felt the icy blast of
a wave of horror and sensed the
shadowy thing that loped on all
fours by her stirrup its hot breath on
her boot and the touch of fearsome
lips on its leather all that evening
she had cowered in her room gazing
the edge op the shadow



at the boot that lay where she had
flung it a broad white mark blasted
on its shining surface for she was
certain then she told him that what
they had said was a terrible dream
four years ago had been no dream at
all

  ivan called to the colors the next
day by the mobilization lay a few
months later a sprawling corpse in

the blood-soaked morasses of the ma-
zurian lakes she told him

  whether or not my friend ever saw
the girl after that i dont know at
any rate he never mentioned the tiling
to me from that day until the night
he died so there the matter lies i can
not give any explanation perhaps
you can but the howl of a dog at
night annoys me

the algerian cave

          by dick heine

  a t first it was strange this
tragic thing hard to under-
jl a stand but now it is so clear
so logical i thought louis fanon
insane perhaps i myself might
have perished if the bullet had come
two feet nearer who knows but
i will tell all-all

  at  oclock in the afternoon of
that unforgettable day i was loung-
ing in the sitting room of my second-
story apartment in paris and waiting
for my friend paul mitrande who
was to drive me to the art reception
at  i am an american artist
arden dexter finishing my studies
abroad paul had been my friend
since the great war for we had
served in the same regiment when i
was brigaded with the french i was
thinking of the picture he was going
to exhibit he had never told me
its name and i hadnt the least idea
what kind it was but he had assured
me that it was certain to win the
prize of fifteen thousand francs
there are many reasons why i am not
going to mention the name and exact
locality of the place where the recep-
tion was held and where occurred the
strange event that led to stranger
things

  just before  paul came in smil-
ing as usual he was about five
feet six inches solid and strong he
was dressed in his usual good taste
this time in gray his face was a
healthy tan a fresh beaming open
face upon which rested an expression
of satisfaction his hair was sleek
and black and beneath his small


dark mustache showed a set of ivory-
white teeth his brown eyes were
almost oriental in their depth of feel-
ing in spite of his french vivacity
paul was at the same time the soul
of calmness

 he placed both hands upon my
shoulders when i rose to greet him

 and how are you arden he
asked the judges have told me
the decision will be reached by tomor-
row night just think-on the next
morning i shall be given the award  
you are always too sure my
friend i said your picture no
doubt is wonderful i wish you
would tell me the name of it  

 the name-it is the algerian
cave and i have created it from
sheer inspiration it is a picture
from the well of my soul i have
drawn upon the treasure house of the
subconscious that you know bears
the writing of the infinite it is ever
revealing something new in the his-
tory of the individual and the race
i am sure of the prize-my work
is a part of me and i believe of
course that i am eternal

  you have your chance paul but
dont forget there are dozens of good
rivals when shall we go-now
his roadster was soon speeding
down an avenue lined with trees that
were just beginning to drop the col-
ored leaves of autumn i settled back
comfortably smoking and thinking
how pleasant it was to have a friend
i dearly loved and not a care in all
the world at length we entered the
rue de la convention and then- the
the algerian cave



avenue de breteuil we did not
drive long in this but left it for a
less well-known street not so very far
from the place vauban paul headed
for the parking space beyond a tall
building on the edge of a square
where dozens of machines were placed
in line

  a number of well-dressed gentle-
men were standing about in the ves-
tibule of the building when we en-
tered and a few students were
pacing the hall by twos and threes
discussing learned subjects in clouds
of tobacco smoke we greeted the
friends we saw and went to a little
open space among the flowers and
plants at the end of the exhibition
room where we sat down and waited
for the reception to begin it was
only a few minutes of the set hour
and people were arriving in consider-
able numbers from my position i
had a good view of the whole room

  it was about fifty feet wide and
seventy long the floor was of pol-
ished hardwood and the ceiling
ornately decorated electric globes
in suitable places aided the skylight
a fountain of water and a statue
stood in the middle of the floor on
the walls were hung the pictures to
be exhibited each one covered with
its veiling cloth

  in groups stood immaculate men
and handsomely gowned women and
girls it was a crowd typical of such
affairs i could see sir marden ford
who pulled always at his little mus-
tache there was a lady gray and
stout but finely finished holding his
arm the students with their attempt
at correct dress and ease of manner
moved leisurely and indifferently
about

  but all these people did not hold
my attention long apart from any-
 one stood a man who interested me
in several ways he was somewhat
taller than paul and dressed in shiny
black he had a black look hanging
about him as if he might be a man of

shady thoughts and unknown deeds

i sensed this personal atmosphere or
whatever it was in a way i could not
understand his beardless face was
dark and sharp and his hair jet-black
a glance into his eyes quick venge-
ful shrewd made me nervous his
prominent nose reminded me of an
eagles beak when he looked keenly
about at everything and everybody
it was difficult to take my gaze from
him i was attempting to form some
estimate of his character and wonder-
ing who he might be when the recep-
tion formally began

   forty-five minutes later the gather-
ing was before the picture painted by
paul mitrande the artist himself
stood near the wall directly by one
end of his canvas and i was at his
elbow ford and his lady were at the
other end of the picture the circling
crowd with interested faces awaited
the lifting of the veil when a spec-
tacled member of some big society
performed that act i saw the al-
gerian cave for the first time

  the painting represented the in-
terior of a cave lighted by the suns
rays streaming in through the mouth
which from the view selected could
be observed opening upon the shining
stretches of a barren wasteland in
one corner of the cave was a niche in
the wall in this niche rested the
golden bust of a beautiful goddess
she shone in the sunlight on the
ground beneath her was an open
treasure chest filled with precious
stones on each side of the chest were
stacks of bars of gold kneeling by
the treasure was a roman soldier
lightly armored but wearing a helmet
his hands were filled with the stones
and he was looking into the face of
the goddess back of this soldier
stood another similarly clad they
were both fine examples of their race
and breed doubtless no better men
had ever thrust the short-sword the
picture was marvelously colored
and i felt that paul mitrande had in-


weird tales

deed created something from the
well of his soul the eternal rome
is forever in the hearts of men this
picture called from the canvas the
gloi-y and adventure of the legions
fighting their way of conquest over
the world in the hinterland of
northern africa two brave men had
stumbled upon the workings of some
unknown race as paul explained
perhaps the treasure and statue had
been placed there by thieves who
had looted a far city ages before the
birth of rome he would leave that
to the fancy of the individual

 many were the sighs of wonder
and admiration i could scarcely
realize myself the triumph of my
friend only one other picture had a
chance against his

  the moment after the first wave
of enthusiasm it happened

  the people gave way to the dark
man in the shiny black suit he
forced himself rudely to the front
and gazed with wild interest at the
picture on his face was the keen-
ness of the hawk after its prey
suddenly he pointed his finger at
smiling paul and cried you a
revolver flashed in the hand of the
man and a sharp report followed

  paul fell into my arms with the
blood spurting from his neck the
stranger would have fired again but
sir marden ford sprang at him tore
the weapon from his hand and
choked him to the floor i dragged
paul out of the crowd and hastened
with him to a bench with the as-
sistance of some other gentlemen
sir marden secured his prisoner

 shall relate briefly the events pre-
ceding my visit on the following
afternoon to the depot of prefecture
of police in the palais de justice the
officers came in from the street when
summoned and relieved the gallant
englishman of his charge the mad-
man proved to be louis fanon and
he was rushed away to the local com-

missaire de police and then taken to
the depot and put in solitary con-
finement an ambulance was called
poor paul was carried to a hospital
the examining surgeon performed
an emergency operation but he
would give out no word about my
friends condition i did not know at
 oclock in the evening whether
paul would live

  the people had been horrified at
the attempted murder no one being
able to understand why such a sud-
den and brutal attack should have
been made sir marden sent me a
personal note at my rooms express-
ing his sympathy and asking to be
remembered to pauls mother he
was sorry that he had not foreseen
the villains intention

  all night i waited in anxiety i
made no attempt to sleep but paced
the sitting room smoking and trying
to understand the thing that had
happened in which i was so much
concerned the thought of pauls
possible death almost felled me
a few years before i had been
hardened against death and destruc-
tion having seen them in all forms
but now relaxed into the ease of
peace i felt the deep grief of a nor-
mal man paul was the dearest
friend i had in paris life would
be sad without him i felt as if i
could no longer continue my studies
but the thing that hung about me
was the mystery of the attack why
should the man have attempted
pauls life  other pictures had been
exhibited where was the relation
between the algerian cave and
the brain of this insane criminal
for the life of me i could make no
progress if paul were to die i
should have a thing unsolved that
would haunt me down the years i
wanted to see my friend to clear up
this mystery to know that in the life
of paul mitrande there was no justi-
fication for this deed i decided to
go as soon as possible and see him
the algerian cave



then i should endeavor to discover
the motive of the criminal

  at  oclock i called on pauls
mother she was so overcome that
she could hardly speak while it
was true that so far i had heard
nothing of her sons condition i
tried to console her saying that i
had indeed heard and that all was
sure to be well she begged me to
go and learn more i left her and
went directly to the hospital

  the attendants were reluctant to
let me see the patient but upon hear-
ing that i was the mans best friend
and came at the request of his
mother they admitted me to the
sickroom before i entered the
nurse told me the bullet had missed
the jugular vein but that some of the
smaller blood-vessels had been dam-
aged paul having stood the an-
esthetic well was resting quite
comfortably amid his white surround-
ings but he was not permitted to
speak his face indicated that he
knew of my anxiety and when he
heard that i had reassured his
mother his teeth showed in a game
grin yet there was a ghastly look
to his face and i knew that if
chance there was it was small in-
deed only the next few hours could
tell

  i am going to find out if possi-
ble paul i said to him why the
attack was committed i suppose you
think as i do that the man is a
maniac i shall ask permission this
afternoon to see him if he will talk
i shall no doubt have something to
tell you when i see you again

 with a grasp of the hand he
thanked me for coming and i left
him but still i did not know
whether he would live i should
have to lie again to his mother if
death came she would overlook the
lie if life prevailed there would be
no harm done

 at  oclock i made my way to
the proper officials they said the

prisoner was not dangerous unarmed
and that i might have a short inter-
view soon surrounded by things of
steel i was face to face with louis
fanon the conducting gentleman
of arms chin in air respectfully
walked away down the corridor
holding lils keys behind his back and
digging his heels into the floor with
an air of absolute indifference

canon sat on a bench in his cell 
and received me with perfect
calm he was clad in his black suit
and looked quite comfortable i was
surprized to see that the mean ex-
pression had vanished he did not
look the same man at all some sort
of relaxation had come over him
the extraordinary keenness of his
eyes was absent and they were now
of a softer light i sat down oppo-
site him and he spoke to me in
french

   so you are monsieur dexter the
friend of paul mitrande

  i am i said and i have come
monsieur fanon to ask you to tell
me why you committed this assault
the man is unknown to you you
doubtless had never seen him be-
fore

  there are many things to be ex-
plained he said suavely but i
will tell them all you assume
monsieur that i am insane i assure
you that nothing could be more un-
true a saner man never walked a
man more devout in his worship of
right never lived i have achieved
my purpose and my heart is calm

  calm you are indeed cold-
blooded to speak so when at the hos-
pital this man lies near to death

  your feelings will be different
when you hear my story there
are things-many things-beyond
the comprehension of materialistic
americans like you no doubt this
criminal mitrande will have a few
apologies to make to me


weird tales

   i could not tolerate these caustic
comments i was almost in a rage
when fanon bade me keep my
temper

  you shall have no interview un-
less you let me say what i must say
you may leave this prison wtith a
hand-clasp of affection for me in-
stead of with the hatred that you
bring

   proceed with your story i said

  he placed the tips of his fingers
together leaned back and looked at
me with an air of complete ease

  i presume monsieur dexter that
you have some imagination we
artists must have or we could never
become artists imagine then if
you can a shining stretch of desert
wasteland picture the sand the far
distances and reflections and colors
make some blue mountains rising
into the sky a long way off imagine
that you saw two roman soldiers
walking across the wasteland they
were lightly armored and wore hel-
mets they were a legions finest
you can imagine those things can
you  

   easily i said looking into his
eyes for some brightness or dilation
that would reveal his evident lunacy

  then i shall proceed to tell you
the story of the two soldiers one
was the soldier quintian and the
other the soldier severus and de-
voted friends they were they would
have died for each other they had
obtained leave from their company
in order to make a four-day trip
into the mountains in search of ad-
venture the blue mountains you
created in the distance were not so
very far from them when their first
days march was over the morning
of the second day found them high
in the hills scanning the gorges
peering into dark holes and looking
everywhere for anything of interest

  at length they came to the
mouth of a cave when they went
inside theylooked behind them and

saw the shining stretches of the
desert framed by the mouth of the
cave in one corner of the cavern
lighted by the rays of the sun was a
little projecting ledge or table upon
which rested the bust of a golden
goddess down on the ground was
a small treasure chest and near each
end some stacks of gold bars

 with a sharp cry severus
dropped on his knees before the chest
and lifted the lid quintian re-
mained standing behind him they
saw gleaming with the colors of
paradise a thousand precious stones
-jewels that would make them rich
beyond the dream of mortals the
sticks of gold were nothing beside
the gems severus feasted his eyes
and scooped up a handful

 now severus could not have
known what went on in the mind of
quintian nor what he did but i
can easily imagine that quintian
stood looking down at what was be-
fore him slowly his face hardened
his right hand went to his short-
sword his left hand snatched the
unbuckled helmet from the head of
severus then in a flash the butt
of the sword descended upon the
bared head severus fell limp and
unconscious with the blood pouring
from his scalp then what did
quintian do oh yes he kicked
the body of severus to one side and
stooped to examine the chest he
filled it with the gold -bars and
strained to lift it to his shoulder it
was almost too much for one man to
carry but he carried it anyway a
last satisfied look at the motionless
severus and quintian left the cave

    severus lay for a day and a half
when he came to his senses he
slowly turned over on his side and
tried to sit up he succeeded feebly
his hand went to his head which
seemed bursting with pain he
crawled to the mouth of the cave and
looked out nothing was to be seen
of quintian and severus then re-
the algerian cave



fleeted how fortunate he was to be
alive he slept upon awakening
his head was clearer and he left the
cave and made his way down among
the rocks to a little stream here
he bathed and refreshed himself
then he ate some berries and de-
scended to the plain a few days
later he was captured by a wandering
tribe and carried away to slavery

  and what became of him after
that i asked impatiently

  he escaped on the borders of
egypt and fled into the interior of
that country a few years  labor
found him still poor and finally
sickness overtook him he fell in
the streets with running sores and
he had to beg for his bread on his
deathbed he cursed the trusted
friend who had wrecked his life

  and now monsieur dexter you
doubtless want to know what be-
came of the soldier quintian sev-
erus befoie his death had learned
a good deal about him by carefully
questioning travelers from rome in
fact he had learned nearly all i shall
tell you quintian escaped from the
mountains with his treasure hired
a substitute to serve in the army
and went to rome there he dis-
posed of his jewels and gold he
moved to sicily and established him-
self in a fine estate he built a great
house and made a vast garden sur-
rounded by marble walls now what
think you of the fate of severus com-
pared with that of quintian

 quintian was a knave and a
scoundrel and severus an unfortu-
nate man betrayed by his friend i
said monsieur fanon you have
but imaginatively constructed a tale
around the picture painted by paul
mitrande who lies now almost cer-
tain to die you are indeed insane
i waxed angry and rose to my feet
unless you can establish your san-
ity you will be sent to a prison
worse than death where are many
like you if -you can prove that you

are in your right senses you will fare
little better you will be convicted
and put to death or given a life sen-
tence at hard labor i shall rejoice
if the blade falls upon your neck
you have no resource i believe that
by this fabrication you hope some-
how to escape

  fanon smiled

  you are inclined to doubt me
monsieur there are many things
you may doubt but do you not see
any relation between what i have
told you and my attack on paul
mitrande

  not the slightest i answered

  paul mitrande was the soldier
quintian and  louis fanon teas
the soldier severus

  i gasped -with staggering compre-
hension

 i refuse to believe you i
shouted how do you know how
do you know

  i was a queer child monsieur
born in the south of france at an
early age i used to stand upon the
seashore and point toward africa
begging my nurse to take me there-
just there over there where i used
to live she would ignore my child-
ish fancies and drag me back to the
house sometimes punishing me i
had flashes of some past existence-
visions of sands of rivers of black
slaves toiling in the sun at five
years of age i fashioned a sword
from a board though i had never
seen a sword and drove my play-
mates from the nursery at six i
lay supposedly dying of a fever de-
lirious i was crying in an unknown
tongue the priest they brought in
rose from the bedside and rushed
from the room later he returned
with the most learned father in the
district they both listened and
agreed that i was talking in latin
they would not translate but said i
was calling for someone the elder
placed his hand upon my head and
answered me in latin immediately


weird tales

i became calm the fever subsided
and the old family doctor clapped his
hands for joy that life was mine
but i was delicate for some time
after that i still wanted to go
across the sea the doctor advised
my father to take me to africa to
satisfy the craving we went on
the desert i was at home they said
i seemed to recognize places to be
joyous at times they observed a
great emotion when we approached
the nile after six months in egypt
i grew stronger in every way i was
brought home to begin my schooling

  i learned rapidly i seemed to
know some of the latin stories when
we came to that study before i read
them the teachers astounded
hinted at precocious idiocy my
father feared i should die before ma-
turity but my passion for outdoor
play developed me into a running
tearing shouting youth who would
fearlessly charge upon his comrades
in the games

    i know that i was severus there
is no other explanation 

  fanon paused ilis face was tense
and wet with sweat

  i felt as if i wanted to flee from
that cell to hide myself somewhere
to wipe the memory of this day from
my brain paul mitrande-

 i rose and stepped toward the
door the hand of fanon held me
back his face had changed to
peacefulness again and he spoke less
vehemently

  in my life monsieur i have been
cursed with a passion for revenge-
a thing i could not understand i
have hated my fellowmen since be-
coming a man i have gone armed
of late years yesterday when i
saw that picture the things of my
other life flashed back to me i
knew that paul mitrande could not

have painted that picture unless he
had been quintian in that cave of
africa two thousand years ago
hardly knowing wthat i did i shot
him you know the rest here i
am perhaps to be adjudged insane
perhaps to be convicted and impris-
oned or put to death and never to fin-
ish my studies and become an artist
known to the world but it may be
well after all i have not the means
to complete my courses i shall have
to wait upon the doing of the law

  tears came into his eyes and he
sank baek upon his bench

  i left the prison hurriedly in the
taxieab that hurled me along the
boulevards i tried to collect my rea-
son i could do nothing but believe
the things fanon had told me
the dangerous condition of paul
mitrande finally brought me in touch
with reality again and when i en-
tered the hospital i was almost my-
self again

taul mitrande lived he is calmly
- sitting on my sofa now while i
finish the story i have set myself to
write every day he has driven over
to sit by the fire to gaze into its
flames and to muse over the things
that may be and that may not be
sometimes he is sad sometimes joy-
ous and often in his deep brown
eyes i see the welling of mans im-
penetrable soul the algerian
cave was awarded the prize paul
recommended that lenity be shown
louis fanon and the court gave it
the prisoner was released after a
very short term the day he was
freed paul met him at the prison
gates and handed him a deposit-book
and a check-book then fanon
learned that paul had deposited to
his credit ten thousand francs of the
prize money
the epic of the microbe-hunters

the dark chrysalis

by eli colter

the story so far

saul blauvette working in his laboratory with
john cloud and henry arn discovers the
microbe of cancer-a germ shaped like a devil-
fish that is visible only when stained with a
combination of red and blue dye he finds that
his mother is tainted with the cancer-microbe
and feverishly works to find a cure for the
dread disease he is spurred on by helene kin-
kaids faith in him

the scientists first succeed-
ing step was further experi-
mentation on the animals
from every rat mouse guinea-pig
and rabbit and monkey in the lab-
oratory he with the aid of cloud and
arn examined a piece of flesh while
he waited the doctors gruesome bot-
tles of samples it took the three
men two days to make the final
round and their findings were pre-
cisely the same as they had been
with human flesh in several rats
guinea-pigs mice and one monkey
they found the devil-fish microbes
swarming like bees in a hive the
other animals were free from the
bacterium all these in the animals
on which they had as yet made no
attempt to produce a cancer in all
the animals developing cancer the
microbe multiplied and throve hav-
ing satisfied himself so far saul be-
gan a series of ghastly experiments

  into each of the animals un-
touched by the microbe he injected
live groping bacteria from the flesh
of the dead mans tongue saving out
only a few of each species immune
on each of the animals receiving the
germ he began the process of irrita-
tion with his tar and oils and gums
one monkey free of the cancer germ
he saved for a third test he began

the process of irritation to deter-
mine whether an animal not having
the microbe in its flesh could de-
velop the cancer growth all this
done saul thought of the doctors
bottles and hurried away to
whittlys office

  whittly had the bottles ready
and the little scientist stared at the
packet with its grisly contents
wheeled abruptly and began pacing
aimlessly about the room then he
paused suddenly and faced the old
doctor

  wheres helene

  gone out for lunch saul shell
regret having missed you

  not so much as i but ill see
her soon doc-sauls eyes cen-
tered on whittlys facc harassed
and probing-arn and mother are
swarming with those damned mi-
crobes arns healthy as a bear ap-
parently but mother hasnt been
well for a long time shes never
said a word to me about herself i
never dared ask she keeps such a
grim silence ive been brought up
to respect it but sometimes-ive
seen her eyes do you know any-
thing about it

  i dont know whittly answered
slowly turning his eyes out the win-
dow to escape sauls penetrating
gaze her brother and her father
died of cancer of the liver didnt
you know that well they did i
fancy shes afraid her colors bad
but she stays in her shell shell
never come to me till shes driven

sick by fear and then itll be too
late

  by god itll never be too late
saul interrupted swiftly give me
those bottles he snatched the
packet from the table and ran from
the room leaving whittly staring
after him with strange eyes

  he raced into the laboratory where
cloud and arn awaited him impa-
tiently all that day three excited
men hung over the microscopes in
none of the flesh did they discover
any microbes in saul there was
bom a frenzy that turned the labora-
tory into a shambles littered with
blood and fur and stench noisy with
the squeals and whimpers of suffering
and dying animals the scientists
worked over the squealing brutes
brewed soups of seeds and broths
from meat and set to work to obtain
a pure culture microbe for further
experimentation the ghastly little
devil-fish grew with appalling speed

    if they can grow at that rate how
in blazes does it take a cancer so long
to develop arn demanded frown-
ing at the microscope and shaking his
head

  amount of demoralization in the
tissue saul returned the more
broken down the tissue the faster the
bugs can get in their work weve
got to find something that will kill
them when injected into the body
and yet not injure the human being
i know theres no use in trying any
vaccine process with them weve
got to make a totally foreign serum-
god knows from what well make it
but well find it and then all the
broken-down tissue in the world cant
become housing space for a cancer
but-proof proof we havent
any proof weve got to waste time
doing all these things to prove what
i already know-or even i wont be
satisfied

  yes weve got to get busy proving
something all right we dont even
know yet that those microbes arent

in a dozen other diseases they may
not have a thing to do with the real
causation of cancer

  youre ratty saul snapped
rats-pure rats of course theyre
the cause of cancer havent i just
got through explaining to you what i
know but we dont dare make a
move toward our goal till weve gone
through the maddening process of
proving-proving im going to see
doc whittly

  so again the old doctor was called
into the ring a willing and eager par-
ticipant in the cause of materializing
sauls great dream again whittly
turned over to saul several bottles
with ghastly contents shivering in-
voluntarily to think of the dangers
faced night and day by those three
tireless men and saul blauvette and
his faithful coworkers bent unweary-
ing over blisters from measles pa-
tients blood from a tuberculous man
pus from the one smallpox patient in
town and even the terrible discharge
from the flesh of a syphilis-eaten
baby at the end of the long hideous
day saul raised to his meager height
and looked at his two assistants tri-
umphantly in not one of the other
diseases did a single devil-fish microbe
appear it belonged to that malig-
nant thing called cancer and that
alone

  cloud gave back sauls slight smile
nodding you win old man im
beginning to think youll win all the
viay

  of course  win saul retorted
vehemently thats so much proof
now weve got to get back to the rab-
bits and rats and guinea-pigs these
three things weve got to prove with
them that only in the animals having
cancer germs will a cancer appear
that in an animal not infested with
the germ you cant start a cancer to
save your soul and that the cancer
germ itself will never give us a serum
to do the trick of annihilating cancer
and the world waits-and weve so
the dark chrysalis



much to do lets go biit he was
thinking of his gaunt and silent
mother she knew that he had lied

a gain long days of experimenting
and as they worked weeks and
months began to fly they searched
diligently through pieces of animal
flesh and examined sore and irritated
bellies on none of the animals not
inoculated by the cancer germ did
any sign of cancer appear cracks and
small lumps grew and the moment
the irritation was suspended they
healed quickly and passed away on
the belly of one guinea-pig they had
inoculated with the germ a crack ap-
peared a crack that did not heal
saul took a minute piece of the irri-
tated edge of the crack and put it
under the microscope the membrane
was broken and angry they re-
doubled their efforts at applying irri-
tation

  in a few months another piece of
tissue from the small growing sore
was put under the microscope the
delieate epithelial cells had grown
more numerous thickened and all
around the edge a congregation of
blood cells was gathered trying to
assist the sore to heal but the lit-
tle devil-fish microbes were hard at
work on the weakened tissue and it
showed no indication of healing in
a few months more the sore had
grown hard bled easily and had a
look of going deep the cells which
before were merely thickened and
angry now apparently had begun to
grow saul pointed it out to arn and
looked at him with triumphant en-
thusiasm in his enormous slate-colored
eyes

  see that and they tell you can-
cer is a nucleus of seemingly normal
cells that suddenly begin to spread
and eat up all the surrounding tis-
sues rats look at those bugs
the cells arent really growing the
dirty little devil-fish have settled in
them and started housekeeping mul-

tiplying breaking down new tissue
eating it cis fast as it breaks enough
to become susceptible then they
branch out the cancer grows deeper
the epithelial cells penetrate to the
lymphatics and follow to the nearest
glands weve proved the causation
and explanation of that thing called
cancer henry

  yes arn nodded somberly as
cloud bent over the lens and squinted
his red-rimmed eyes at the squirming
bacteria

  that wasnt so difficult saul
went on wearily what is to come
is the almost impossible task  

    conquering the microbe    cloud
half stated half questioned

  and thereby cancer saul sup-
plemented  we ve got our real work
ahead of us weve proved conclu-
sively that the microbe itself cant
aid us in making a serum-i knew
it all before we started weve got
to find some serum thatll do the
trick though local application is of
course out of the question since the
microbes go all over the body and
when we do find the serum that will

knock the devil-fish-

  the world will go wild cloud
cut in think of it all anyone
has to do is be tested to see whether or
not he has it in his system and if
he has it take the serum and he
couldnt get cancer on a bet

  but weve got to start some-
where arn frowned watching saul
and if you know that-where to
start-were on the last lap

  were on the last lap all right
saul strode over to the microscope
and stared into it but god knows
when well reach the post no-i
dont know where to start but well
experiment with mercury for a be-
ginning

there were then three years
three years in which sauls
mother moved ever more slowly ever
more gaunt the faded sallowness of


weird tales

her face deepening to a sinister shade
three years in which fear and despair
came to brood over the great barn of
a laboratory and the adjoining living-
house while whittly looked on with
bitter silence and grim eyes three
years that whirled crazily by while
three men grew old in their youth
turned gray at the temples worked
frantically with devil-fish microbes
and did weird horrible things in their
tireless search for the serum that
would conquer the cancer microbe

  they injected aged and devitalized
germs into rats and guinea-pigs half
eaten by cancer only to see the germs
grow live and active the moment they
joined their kind sending the small
animals to swift and hideous death
they dried spinal cords and brains
blood and body-juices made serums
and injected them into animals
doomed with the malignant tumors
only to see the cancers increase with
appalling speed and send other small
beasts to horror and extermination

  three men grew thin of body lean
of hope and sick of heart but they
never relaxed their efforts when-
ever despair descended to sit on the
shoulders of saul blauvette he
looked into his mothers eyes and
drove himself harder than ever and
when he was too weary to go another
step without relief he sought rest and
surcease in the arms of helene
kinkaid a strange situation ob-
tained between helene and sauls
mother never yet had the girl come
near the laboratory never yet had
sauls mother left it saul knew that
the gaunt fear-ridden woman held
off from her harshly the idea of that
other woman iu sauls life he told
helene delicately as he could and
queerly enough helene understood

  its jealousy saul she said
gently a strange kind of jealousy
all mothers know when their children
come to love and another person en-
ters the scene i think she must be-
lieve that marriage with me will take

you from her how can i convince
her that i long to take her to my
arms in place of the mother that died
in my infancy what can i do

  nothing saul shook his head
somberly   its a situation that must
resolve itself somehow i feel sure
that it will by some twist of circum-
stance

  helene nodded slowly believing in
him with utter faith and in all that
he said but if either of them could
have looked ahead and seen the twist
of circumstance that was to bring
those two women together their
cheeks would have paled and their
hearts gone sick sauls mind was
too occupied with his life-work to give
it much thought

  never once did he lose sight of his
great vision forever holding an inner
mind-picture of the dark chrysalis
broken open at last bringing light to
a fear-bound world here and there a
man sprang into prominence with a
new   cure for cancer   saul held his
breath ready to cheer on a man more
successful than he only to find the
cure as crazily erratic as without
basis or virtue as all the old cures
and he turned to delve anew into
his own research with john cloud at
one elbow and henry arn at the
other

  then henry arn began to suffer
continuously with an ugly indiges-
tion it had been bothering him per-
sistently through the last year grow-
ing steadily worse he had paid lit-
tle heed to it dismissing it as nothing
believing its cause to be mainly strain-
ing overwork hastily snatched meals
and too little sleep but when it be-
came so bad that he could keep noth-
ing on his stomach when he found
himself with sharp pain and contin-
ual nausea for constant companions
he went to doc whittly and asked for
some prescription for a   slight stom-
ach disorder he had strange as it
may seem quite forgotten that in his
the dark chrysalis



flesh the little devil-fish microbes
swarmed and throve and grew

  whittly examined him quickly al-
most perfunctorily and helene paled
listening at the old doctors words

  i-am you want the truth
certainly am started at the
doctors tone and his own sallow
cheek grew a shade paler

  youve a well-developed cancer of
the stomach whittly responded
turning his eyes from the shock in
arns face for gods sake man
why didnt you come to me before
ive been watching you i was dis-
turbed at your color but none of
you ever said anything about your
having any symptoms

  i didnt think it amounted to
anything am answered shudder-
ing involuntarily cancer ive
got it my god doc cant you do
anything for mef

  its too late whittly shook his
head and his eyes were stricken i
could put you on the operating table
and cut you up but it would be ut-
terly useless nobody can save you
now but saul blauvette

  henry looked for a moment into
the pitying eyes of whittly and
helene kinkaid and turned to walk
slowly from the office like a very old
man too weary to lift his head and
mark which way he was going

  so he came to the laboratory white-
faced and weary-eyed and saul look-
ing into his face sprang toward him
with a startled cry henry whats
the matter are you sick

  sick to death am answered
and cloud paled as he heard
whittly says i have cancer of the
stomach and its too late even to
operate he says nobody can save
me but you

 oh my god henry you
sauls enormous eyes went wide then
blinked shut as though to close from
his sight some hideous picture

  and i a harsh fear-chilled
voice came from the doorway

  the three men wheeled to see sauls
mother standing facing them her
head high her face grim and in her
eyes the agony of all hell

    mother what are you saying  
sauls voice rose to a half-hysterical
shout

  doctor whittly was here yester-
day at my request you did not
know i demanded his secrecy he
told me what he told henry i have
cancer of the liver nothing can be
done no one can save me but you my
son she spoke with the grim con-
trol of her stern nature but saul read
the hopeless horror underneath

  the little scientist threw his hands
over his head in a gesture of wild
despair

  and i am powerless for three
years we have worked and slaved and
nothing has rewarded us mother
you-and henry my god im go-
ing mad ive got to get out of
here

  he whirled and raced from the
room out into the gathering dusk
leaving behind him horror and pain
and sick despair straight as a hom-
ing pigeon flies he went to helene

  come to the hill he begged of
her frigid in his terror of the thing
ahead come out to our little hill
ive got to talk to you or ill go
mad

  without a word of question she fol-
lowed him to the little birch-clad hill
between the laboratory and the little
town and there he turned to her
took her in his arms and hid his face
on her shoulder

  helene he choked shivering as
he put his horror into words
mother and henry arn-

  i know the girl interrupted
him gripping him with arms that
would drive from him his soul-break-
ing desperation i know doctor
told me their salvation lies in you
saul listen-listen dear you cant
break now


weird

tales

  	 i cant go on  sauls voice rose
and he lifted his head to stare into
her face through the deepening shad-
ows i dont know which way to
turn weve been working like mad
for three years to discover the ele-
ment that will kill that germ and
weve failed failed miserably we
may search on for three years more
helene how long have mother and
am to live

  arn can have but a few months
your mother at best a year helene
answered her voice bitter with regret

 a few months-a few months-a
year good god   sauls arms held
her convulsively and his words were
harsh with his emotion and we
may work a dozen years a lifetime-
and then not find it there is some-
thing that will conquer that cancer
microbe somewhere in the world it
waits the man who can find it but
only god knows what it is

 ah-there you said it only
god knows havent you been for-
getting a bit about god some-
thing in her tone struck deep and the
frenzy that swirled in sauls racked
brain hushed to hear god knows
and only god can help you now i
tell you god guards his own but god
does not will that they shall forget
him i told you once before that
man does all things through god
saul and when men think they are
supreme and that they can work the
world to their will without him he
brings them to their knees as he
has brought you you cant go one
step farther without the aid of god
saul listen to me youve got to
turn to god

  	 i-yes my own yes   the scien-
tist nodded his head his frenzy gone
looking into her eyes with a strange
mixture of bewilderment and trust
im ready tell me what to do i
guess i was forgetting about god  

 most men forget about god-
helenes lips quivered then went still
-till they are driven to the wall

down on your knees beloved here in
the grass lift your head and pray

  she released herself from his arms
and dropped lithely to her knees
pulling him down beside her her face
uplifted saul gripped her hand with
both of his raising his face to the
now dark and star-flecked sky pray-
ing aloud a queer little stumbling
prayer

 god-are you there help me
can you hear i-i dont know how
to pray a man drifts i guess ive
drifted-away from you help me
send me some answer by which i may
know-give me the light help me
to save henry-mother-help me to
save the world god-are you
there

  silence on the little hill silence
singing and a cool breeze blowing
down over two on their knees in the
grass faces lifted to the eternal stars
helenes voice like a muted silver
bell

 he heard i know-he heard

  in a solemn hush they went down
the little hill and parted

  a lone saul walked and waited till
the lights went out in the great
building where he worked and in the
adjoining house and that night in
the welter of writhing wo that
shrouded the laboratory carrying his
faith and the memory of helenes
calm face saul blauvette had a
dream

  he dreamed that he stood on the
top of their little hill with the birch
trees rising slimly around him and
the cool breeze blowing into his face
then suddenly ahead of him a great
devil-fish appeared creeping down
from the sky reaching and groping
with its long hideous arms stunned
with fear sick to death of a weaken-
ing nausea he could neither breathe
nor move a muscle to fight the thing
but only stare at it and wait for the
horrible death that crawled upon him
as it drew nearer he saw that it was
the dark chrysalis



a mass of putrid stinking flesh and as
the sinuous arms groped and writhed
his mother and henry arn abruptly
appeared in its path the ghastly
arms gripped and began to crush
them and saul suddenly crazed into
action began struggling and scream-
ing and beating at the terrible mass

  his frantic efforts were of less ef-
fect than the puff of wind swirling
around his head the horrible mass
choked him and his nostrils smothered
in the stench and fumes of its putre-
faction

  then a small snake hardly a foot
long came creeping over his feet
through the wash of dew that covered
the grass rattling its small tail men-
acingly it reared its tiny head and
struck at the gigantic devil-fish it
struck but once yet instantly the
monster quivered loosed its hold on
its victims shriveled up like a leaf in
flame and faded away

  saul blauvette staggered back in
his dream throwing up his arms with
a great cry breathing gratefully the
clean air rid of the nauseous fumes
and just ahead of him on a limb of
one of the slim birches he saw a dark
gray chrysalis it burst open as he
gazed a gorgeous butterfly crawled
out into the sunlight tested its wings
and drank in the glow of a new day
as the sun flamed in the sky and the
world was bathed with light then
the dream faded and saul woke with
a great start sat up in his bed and
cried aloud to john cloud

 john john get up quick
we have to get hold of some rattle-
snakes   

  cloud leaped out of his bed where
he had been lying wide-eyed came
running into the room and turned on
the light to stand staring at saul with
startled eyes had the wonder-
seeker gone mad  saul saw the ques-
tion in his face and answered it

  no ive not gone mad ive had
a dream listen and he went on
to explain rapidly the vision of the

devil-fish and the snake and the but-
teifly bursting out of the dark chrys-
alis into the light

  i wonder cloud said dazedly
i wonder

 dont wonder saul shouted
leaping out of bed and catching at
his shoulders mother and henry
are dying dont you realize that
dont wonder get me some rattle-
snakes  

 but where will i get them
cloud demanded shaking himself
into coherent thought

 my god i dont know out in
arizona wyoming-anywhere that
its hot i guess hurry man
hurry  

  cloud whirled and ran into his own
room got into his clothes and rushed
into the garage where stood sauls
little-used powerful ear a half-hour
later he was racing down the highway
toward the desert country three hun-
dred miles distant where rattlesnakes
lived and multiplied the great car
roared through the little town and
shot on leaving waking wondering 
people behind it

  in the town people looked at each
other and frowned spme rose and
went to their windows to get a
glimpse of the big maroon car tearing
by in the moonlight that crazy
scientists car what was he up to
now for many months sentiment
had been rising in the town concern-
ing the laboratory it was known
only as the isolated experimental lab-
oratory of the weird erratic queer-
looking little saul blauvette specu-
lation began to rise concerning what
grisly things might be going on in
that guarded mysterious and silent
place sentiment in the town began
to frown at the great barnlike build-
ing wholeheartedly wishing it away
from there watching askance for
some tangible evidence of dark and
ugly deeds

  the next day there passed secretly
from tongue to tongue the knowledge


weird

tales

of the passage of the great car roar-
ing through in the night where had
blauvette gone on what sudden
and imperative errand then some
saw blauvette walking toward the
birch-clad hill with helene kinkaid
and speculation rose higher if it
were not blauvette himself who had
raced away so summarily then who
and why

  saul had gone to seek helene and
tell her of his dream there on the
top of the hill they pieced it together
and sought the answer to its riddle

  but there is no riddle really
helene said when saul had finished
giving her the details of his vision
it is very clear the rattlesnake
poison is the element you seek

  of course i sent cloud after
some snakes in the middle of the
night   saul laid his hand over hers
where it pressed the deep grass and
the diminutive proportionate size of
the snake is significant that i shall
use the poison sparingly in my solu-
tion the only other element clear in
the dream was the dew-water the
world was wet with dew-and dew is
traditionally supposed to be pure i
must distill the water distilled wa-
ter and rattlesnake poison it sounds
wild insane but i know weve got
the answer i even feel a sort of
calmness inside all ive got to do is
wait till cloud comes back and were
on the home stretch

  and here in the morning of new
hope must we thank god who sent
you the dream helenes face
raised to the light-washed sky-but
saul bowed his head

	b hen for a week saul paced the
laboratory restlessly belying that
calmness he had felt for a moment in
his soul every waking hour length-
ened into an eternity as he waited
the return of john cloud every few
moments he hurried into the house on
one pretext or another to glance at
his mothers face he followed the

weakening stricken henry am with
terrible eyes henry am could now
with difficulty stay from his bed but a
few hours at a time his nausea and
his gnawing pain had made of him
but a shell and by the end of the
week of suspense saul was a mad
ghost of himself turning desperately
to helene for strength when he felt
that he must know her steady poise
or break

  then john cloud came back came
with a box in the tonneau of the ear
that held seven huge rattlesnakes he
rushed into the house stared into
henry arns sallow pain-drawn
face and turned choking from mrs
blauvettes awful eyes to set down
the box before saul inside of ten
minutes saul had killed the seven
snakes and was cutting out their
poison sacs

  there ensued one terrible frantic
month in which henry am and mrs
blauvette went steadily marching to-
ward the yawning doors of death
while john cloud and saul worked
strange and fearful havoc with rat-
tlesnake poison and distilled water
they took the hideous virulent stuff
and diluted it four-fifths they put
a squirming mass of the devil-fish
microbes under the lens while henry
am crept in and stood looking on
with staring haggard eyes onto the
microbes they dropped the diluted
poison and the microbes shriveled up
and died they injected the solution
into a guinea-pig with three cancers
every microbe in the animals body
died but the guinea-pig died also

  and through that month down in
the little adjoining town rumor
speculation and ugly suspicion once
roused grew and intensified against
the laboratory out in the trees

  there was no one to tell of the
heroic nights and days through which
two tireless men worked frantically
on eating little sleeping less madly
experimenting with ghoulish bugs
and deadly poison while two pain-
the dark chrysalis



racked doomed watehed with staring
eyes helene and whittly hearing
breath of the rumor of dissatisfaction
and resentment against the labora-
tory spoke of it with anxious hearts
and held their tongues knowing the
utter futility of anything they could
say

  the laboratory became the housing
space for dozens of rattling hissing
snakes john cloud had left orders
with an old prospector on the desert
to catch and ship him all the rattle-
snakes that he could ferret out of
rocks and holes those mysterious
boxes arriving regularly to spew
their deadly contents into the labo-
ratory did their silent share in in-
creasing the sentiment daily rising in
the little town the laboratory be-
came an abattoir a madhouse
henry arn and mrs blauvette looked
on sick to the soul afraid to hope
while helene and whittly waited
apart in a numb silent suspense
guinea-pigs died rats mice and
rabbits died monkeys died-even as
the microbes died till the half-
crazed scientists had left but one
monkey two rats one tiny brown and
white guinea-pig and a few mice all
the remaining animals bore rotting
hideous cancers on their bellies and
the soul-weary men were no nearer
an effective solution than they had
been before

  then again the frantic little scien-
tist sought helene kinkaid and again
they walked upon the hilltop and dis-
cussed the dream

  im almost at the end of my
tether sauls blue-ringed eyes and
haggard face were turned to the girl
as he spoke and his body drooped
against her wearily as though it were
taking all his strength to keep his
feet i tell you im about done
what way is there to turn and
every hour mother and henry am
are dying

  sit down a moment and rest
helene slipped to the grass and

pulled him down beside her he
threw himself full-length in the grass
and laid his tired head in her lap
she looked out across the trees into
the sky was there no other ele-
ment in that dream dew-dew and
poison and-saul the devil-fish
came crawling out of the sky didnt
he out of the air-ether
ether saul leaped to his feet
with a wild shout cursing his own
lack of divination staring at her with
startled eyes   ether my god
what a blind man i am of course
we need ether

  he wheeled and raced down the
hill toward the laboratory with only
a backward look a shout and a wave
of his arm before he disappeared
running from her sight helene un-
derstanding smiled after him with
quivering lips and her eyes were wet
as she turned to go down the other
side of the hill to tell whittly of the
new idea and the rebirth of hope

saul burst into the laboratory with
a shout that brought cloud run-
ning ether we need ether
john bring me the ether

  cloud whirled to a shelf across the
cluttered stinking room snatched
down an ether can and rushed across
the laboratory to place the can in
sauls shaking fingers then madly
they set to work again while arn and
mrs blauvette hearing the loud
cries came stealing to the door to look
on like ghosts and wonder

  the last serum made their five
hundred and tenth solution had been
little short of seeming success the
rat with cancer upon which they had
tried it had lived two days in three
hours they had tested his flesh to find
the microbes dead and absorbed the
cancerous growth had begun to
shrivel and dry up the day he died
the flesh had begun to assume a
healthy tone around the edges of the
thick dry scab and had started heal-
ing

  to that solution saul blauvette
added his ether he studied it out
minutely the dew had covered the
earth in his dream the ether had
covered the earth he must use equal
proportions of ether and distilled wa-
ter the two scientists with arn and
the gaunt-eyed mrs blauvette look-
ing on held their breath and prayed
when the five hundred and eleventh
serum was injected into the leg of a
guinea-pig dying of cancer whimper-
ing in his cage

  but that guinea-pag did not die
in two hours microscopic examina-
tion of his flesh showed that every
microbe was dead and absorbed in
three hours more the cancerous
growths began to shrivel and dry
swiftly they degenerated into nothing
but a scab over the tender flesh then
saul plucked the scab away to find
healthy firm tissue growing under-
neath the guinea-pig scampered
about his cage ate piggishly and be-
gan to grow fat and when saul
knew what he had done he stared at
his mother wildly glanced once into
henry arns pain-racked eyes and
fainted on the floor john cloud
picked him up carried him into his
own room and went for old doc
whittly

  his mother stood over him with a
ghastly face her eyes glaring with
the insane light of fanatical hope
like a woman in a dream while arn
exclaimed over what saul had done
together those two doomed ones
waited like senseless statues by their
wonder-worker till whittly and
cloud came rushing in the door
whittly bent over him felt his pulse
and raised to smile at mrs blau-
vette

  it is merely litter exhaustion
let him sleep well wait but he
thought of helene helene long
since asleep fitfully in her own room
her mind following saul every foot
of the way and whittly felt a grim

anger that she could not be here now
in this hour of triumph

  they waited in an aching hush the
four of them while the hours passed
and the little scientist slept on
whittly ordered cloud to lie down
and get some rest but cloud fought
his drooping lids and waited with
them henry arn unable to keep his
feet had dropped into a chair sleep-
ing fitfully waking often to stare at
saul with mad eyes saul slept for
eighteen hours and when he woke it
was night again his mother stood
by whittly at the foot of his bed
cloud stood at his right hand and
henry am dozed in a chair saul
sat up stared at them and leaped out
upon the floor

  weve got it doc he shouted
weve got it weve discovered the
formula that kills the microbe with-
ers the cancer and lets the being
live  

  john told me whittly held
sauls eyes with a steady gaze i
want you to give it immediately to
henry arn

  saul henry shook himself
awake and staggered to his feet be-
seeching the wonder-worker with
naked appeal saul-im next

  no saul hurled the word at
him and took a step backward i
dont dare try it on a human being
yet not till ive tested it on a few
more animals that might have been
only a happy accident dont ask
again no i tell you no

  arn drooped glanced hopelessly at
whittly turned and dragged out of
the room he knew too well the
strength of saul blauvettes word if
saul said no saul meant no the
others watched arn go in stark si-
lence it was like seeing a man walk
into the void of eternity then
whittly turned to saul with a harsh
reprimand

  saul dont be a fool hes
doomed beyond all hope anyway he
hasnt but a few days or weeks to live
the dark chrysalis



what better man for your last test
than the man who has worked with
you side by side   

  no i tell you no saul shouted
at him violently and started for the
door to be met by the returning fig-
ure of henry arn saul stopped
short at the look on arns face

  the doomed man stood before them
as a soldier going into battle his head
high his eyes flaring with an exalted
light something about him sent a
hush over the room and though his
voiice was little above a whisper it
rang through the room like a temple
gong

  i have taken it myself you
wouldnt give it to me i know you
too well saul so i have taken it
myself it may be imagination but
i think that already my deathly
nausea is lessening time will tell
time alone i gave my life to this
cause remember not in the letter but
in the deed

  saul sank back on the edge of his
bed and buried his head in his hands
no one moved till arn spoke again
now i am going to bed and sleep
if i wake-in the morning-

  well all be there whittly an-
swered and cloud added a hoarse and
vehement amen to the promise as am
went again from their sight

  they heard him go into his own
room then silence fell saul did
not move none of them moved
they knew am had thrown himself
upon his blankets fully dressed they
waited tensely for what seemed an
eternity till whittly stepped softly
across to ams room to find him
peacefully asleep one by one the
others filed in and grouped them-
selves around his bed saul coming
last like a man drawn toward some
horror beyond his will they waited
asleep in their chairs till dawn came
in the window to waken them whittly
moved rose and stretched his tired
muscles walked across to the bed and
felt arns pulse arn stirred opened

his eyes smiled up at whittly and
glanced around at the others sitting
suspense-racked in the cool dawn

  yes-youre all here eh i feel
like a new man doe nausea gone
pain gone a little weak hows
my pulse lord its good to be free
of pain saul-you-you miracle-
worker do you know what it means
to be free of pain and doc-im
hungry cant i have something to
eat

  why yes-yes i guess so
whittlys voice was husky and he
turned to mrs blauvette reading the
flaming hope in her eyes as he spoke
you might get him a soft poached
egg and a little milk if you will

  mrs blauvette moved out of the
room with more haste than saul had
ever seen her show and arn closed
his eyes again his drawn face relaxed
into the calm of rest and release from
pain silence fell once more si-
lences seemed a part of the great
barnlike laboratory and the adjoin-
ing house-tense silences and shout-
ing frantic cries

as mrs blauvette came in again
noiselessly to give the food to
arn whittly turned to saul and
spoke wed better go out now and
let the man sleep he needs a lot of
rest after all the pain and exhaustion
he has endured hell have to come
baek slowly but before i go i want
you to give  to-your mother

 mother sauls cry was
wrenched out of his throat and his
cheek blanched as his gaze leaped to
her face involuntarily she straight-
ened staring deep into his enormous
eyes and in the tone of his cry and
the pallor of his features the gaunt
and silent woman read the love of her
son   mother i cant im afraid  

  whittly looked steadily into the lit-
tle scientists face and read accu-
rately that fear rats and mice and
rabbits were one thing and a
guinea-pig was only a guinea-pig

henry arn had worked with him side
by side had taken the matter of his
own life in his hands to prove or dis-
prove the efficacy of formula 
but this woman was his mother the
woman who had given him of her
flesh and blood that he might walk
through the world and become a man
the woman who had fed and clothed
him and believed in him when others
laughed and sneered the woman
who would never fail him in the val-

heaven or on earth his mother her
blood in his veins her substance in
his bones her gift in his flesh he
knew then how her mighty love had
grown in her grim silence and envel-

him what he was his mother

  i cant i cant i tell you
saul sprang to his feet and backed
away his hand held out as if to ward
off a blow im afraid

  so is she whittlys harsh voice
cut in swiftly   she has been afraid
for twenty years the whole world
is afraid what of your dark chrys-
alis  she cant live another month if
you dont do something for her
youve got to work quickly youve
proved your formula look at arn  

  sauls eyes leaped to arns face
and arn looked back at him sanely
steadily smiling his reassurance

  i know sauls gaze turned to
his mother and his face was white
as chalk the solution works the
same on rat monkey or mouse it
should work the same on a human be-
ing but im afraid he shook
his head setting his teeth and his
enormous eyes burned black in his
face i tell you i cant do it not
yet wait a week to be sure that
henry-

  and in a week your mother may
die whittlys voice was sharp he
knew he was arguing against the pale
angel with the scythe and he heard
the thud of clods on a grave

  shell not die by my hand

sauls voice rose and he winced visi-
bly mother im afraid

  he swayed on his feet and his
mother walked up to him and placed
her hands on his shoulders looking
down into his colorless face with her
terrible eyes he quivered at her
touch he stood like a man turned
to stone as her voice broke upon his
ears in wild words strange words
from her the grim and silent woman

    saul you are too exhausted to use
that magnificent brain reason my
son reason what if i should die
under the serum treatment  it would
be a shorter more merciful death i
suffer you can save me that at
least i ask you what henry asked
you do you know what it means to
be free of pain  but i shall not die
i feel it-i know you have life in
your two hands-life for me and for
the world are you going to let an
unreasonable groundless fear con-
demn me to death before your eyes
saul-you have life give it to me 

  saul stared at her dumb and
neither whittly nor arn moved it
was as though in that gripping tense-
ness no one breathed no one no-
ticed john cloud as he swiftly and
silently passed from the room he re-
turned almost instantly with a bottle
of  and a needle in his hands to
find them as he had left them trans-
fixed a frozen tableau suddenly
mrs blauvette moved in a quick flash
of frantic abandon to her own driving
fear threw herself on her knees be-
fore her son and held up imploring
hands

    saul i gave you life you must
give life to me now-now while
there is time

  saul continued to stare into her
face like a man hypnotized and
whittly ached for want of breath as
cloud stepped silently across the room
to lay bottle and needle in sauls
hand slowly said opened the bot-
tle her eyes on him holding him
compelling him begging command-
the dark chrysalis



ing all the horror and fear of her life
plainly written on her face for him
to see

  then with one swift motion he filled
the needle caught her upraised arm
and injected the serum into the tis-
sues she winced slightly bit her lip
and threw her arms about his knees
the first sob he had ever heard from
her throat shook her body as he bent
to raise her to her feet then behind
him he heard whittlys voice in a

startled incredulously horror-shaken
tone he wheeled still gripping his
mothers arm to see cloud and
whittly staring fascinatedly at am

  arn lay on his pillows the food
half-eaten on the plate beside him
his face was calm and smiling and
his eyes gazed at them with a look
of infinite peace but the look was
fixed and unmistakable as was the

the dragon fang

by fitz-james obrien

chapter 

the miraculous dragon
fang

-sjome men and women and
  little people of tching-tou
come and listen the small
and ignoble person who annoys you
by his presence is the miserable con-
jurer known as piou-lu everything
that can possibly be desired he can
give you-charms to heal dissensions
in your noble and illustrious fami-
lies-spells by which beautiful little
people without style may become
learned bachelors and reign high in
the palaces of literary composition-
supernatural red pills with which
you can cure your elegant and re-
nowned diseases-wonderful incan-
tations by which the assassins of any
member of your shining and virtuous

families can be discovered and made
to yield compensation or be brought
under the just eye of the brother of
the sun what is it that you want
this mean little conjurer who now
addresses you can supply all your
charming and refreshing desires for
he is known everywhere as piou-lu
the possessor of the ever-renowned
and miraculous dragon fang
there was a little dry laugh and
a murmur among the crowd of idlers
that surrounded the stage erected by
piou-lu in front of the hotel of the
thirty-two virtues fifth-class man-
darins looked at fourth-class manda-
rins and smiled as much as to say
we who are educated men know
what to think of this fellow but
the fourth-class mandarins looked
haughtily at the fifth-class as if they
had no business to smile at their


weird tales

superiors the crowd however com-
posed as it was principally of small
traders barbers porcelain-tinkers
and country people gazed with open
mouths upon the conjurer who clad
in a radiant garment of many colors
strutted proudly up and down upon
his temporary stage

  what is a dragon fang ingen-
ious and well-educated conjurer at
last inquired wei-chang-tze a sol-
emn-looking mandarin of the third
class who was adorned with a sap-
phire button and a one-eyed pea-
cocks feather what is a dragon
fang

  is it possible asked piou-lu
that the wise and illustrious son of
virtue the mandarin wei-chang-tze
does not know what a dragon fang
is and the conjurer pricked up his
ears at the mandarin as a hare at a
barking dog	

  of course of course said
the mandarin wei-chang-tze looking
rather ashamed of his having be-
trayed such ignorance one does not
pass his examinations for nothing i
merely wished that you should ex-
plain to those ignorant people here
what a dragon fang is that was why
i asked

  i thought that the soul of wis-
dom must have known said piou-
lu triumphantly looking as if he be-
lieved firmly in the knowledge of
wei-chang-tze the noble com-
mands of wei-chang-tze shall be
obeyed you all know said he
looking round upon the people that
there are three great and powerful
dragons inhabiting the universe
lung or the dragon of the sky li
or the dragon of the sea and kiau
or the dragon of the marshes all
these dragons are wise strong and
terrible they are wondrously
formed and can take any shape that
pleases them well good people a
great many moons ago in the season
of spiked grain i was following the
profession of a barber in the mean

and unmentionable town of siho
when one morning as i was sitting

in my shop waiting for customers i
heard a great noise of tam-tams and
a princely palanquin stopped before
my door i hastened of course to
observe the honorable rites toward
this newcomer but before i could
reach the street a mandarin splen-
didly attired descended from the
palanquin the ball on his cap was
of a stone and color that i had never
seen before and three feathers of
some unknown bird hung down be-
hind his headdress he held his hand
to his jaw and walked into my house
with a lordly step i was greatly
confused for i knew not what rank
he was of and felt puzzled how to
addrqss him he put an end to my
embarrassment

   i am in the house of piou-lu
the barber he said in a haughty
voice that sounded like the roll of a
copper drum amidst the hills

   that disgraceful and ill-condi-
tioned person stands before you i
replied bowing as low as i could

   it is well said he seating him-
self in my operating-chair while two
of his attendants fanned him piou-
lu i have the toothache

   does your lordship said i
wish that i should remove your
noble and illustrious pain

   you must draw my tooth said
he wo to you if you draw the
wrong one

   it is too much honor i replied
but i will make my abominable and
ill-conducted instruments entice your
lordships beautiful tooth out of your
high-born jaw with much rapidity
so i got my big pincers and my
opium-bottle and opened the strange
mandarins mouth ah it was then
that my low-born and despicable
heart descended into my bowels i
should have dropped my pincers
from sheer fright if they had not
caught by their hooked ends in my
wide sleeve the mandarins mouth
the dragon pang



was all on fire inside as he breathed
the flames rolled up and down his
throat like the flames that gather on
the yellow grass plains in the season
of much heat his palate glowed
like red-hot copper and his tongue
was like a brass stewpan that had
been on the salt-fire for thirty days
but it was his teeth that affrighted
me most they were a serpents
teeth they were long and curved
inward and seemed to be made of
transparent crystal in the center of
which small tongues of orange-
colored fire leaped up and down out
of some cavity in the gums

   well dilatory barber said the
mandarin in a horrible tone while i
stood pale and trembling before him
why dont you draw my tooth
hasten or i will have you sliced
lengthwise and fried in the sun

    my lord said i terrified at
this threat i fear that my vicious
and unendurable pincers are not
sufficiently strong 

   slave answered he in a voice
of thunder if you do not fulfil my
desires you will not see another moon
rise

    i saw that i should be killed any-
way so i might as well make the at-
tempt i made a dart with my pin-
cers at the first tooth that came
closed them firmly on the crystal
fang and began to pull with all my
strength the mandarin bellowed
like an ox of tibet the flames
rolled from his throat in such vol-
ume that i thought they would singe
my eyebrows his two attendants
and his four palanquin-bearers put
their arms round my waist to help
me to pull and there we tugged for
three or four minutes until at last i
heard a report as loud as nine thou-
sand nine hundred and ninety-nine
firecrackers the attendants the
palanquin-bearers and myself all fell
fiat on the floor and the crystal fang
glittered between the jaws of the pin-
cers

  the mandarin was smiling pleas-
antly as i got up from the floor
piou-lu said he you had a narrow
escape you have removed my tooth-
ache but had you failed you would
have perished miserably for i am the
dragon lung who rules the sky and
the heavenly bodies and i am as
powerful as i am wise take as a re-
ward the dragon fang which you
drew from my jaw you will find it
a magical charm with which you can
work miracles honor your parents
observe the rites and live in peace

  so saying he breathed a whole
cloud of fire and smoke from his
throat that filled my poor and des-
picable mansion the light dazzled
and the smoke suffocated me and
when i recovered my sight and breath
the dragon lung the attendants the
palanquin and the four bearers had
all departed how and whither i knew
not thus was it elegant and re-
fined people of tching-tou that this
small and evil-minded person who
stands before you became possessed
of the wonderful dragon fang with
which he can work miracles

this story delivered as it was with
much graceful and dramatic
gesticulation and a volubility that
seemed almost supernatural had its
effect upon the crowd and p poor
little tailor named hang-pou who
was known to be always in debt was
heard to say that he wished he had
the dragon fang wherewith to work
miracles with his creditors but the
mandarins blue crystal and gilt
smiled contemptuously and said to
themselves we who are learned
men know how to esteem these
things

  the mandarin wei-chang-tze how-
ever seemed to be of an inquiring
disposition and evinced a desire to
continue his investigations

  supremely visited conjurer
said he to piou-lu your story is in-
deed wonderful to have been visited


weird tales

by the dragon lung must have been
truly refreshing and enchanting
though not in the least doubting
your marvelous relation i am sure
this virtuous assemblage would like
to see some proof of the miraculous
power of your dragon fang

  the crowd gave an immediate as-
sent to his sentiment by pressing
closer to the platform on which piou-
lu strutted and exclaiming with one
voice   the lofty mandarin says
wisely we would like to behold

  piou-lu did not seem in the slight-
est degree disconcerted his narrow
black eyes glistened like the dark
edges of the seeds of the water-melon
and he looked haughtily around him

  is there any one of you who
would like to have a miracle per-
formed and of what nature he
asked with a triumphant wave of his
arms

    i would like to see my debts
paid murmured the little tailor
hang-pou

   hang-pou replied the con-
jurer this unworthy personage is
not going to pay your debts go
home and sit in your shop and drink
no more rice-wine and your debts
will be paid for labor is the dragon
fang that works miracles for idle
tailors

  there - was a laugh through the
crowd at this sally because hang-
pou was well known to be fond of in-
toxicating drinks and spent more of
his time in the street than on his
shop-board

  would either of you like to be
changed into a camel continued
piou-lu say the word and there
shall not be a finer beast in all
tibet

  no one however seemed to be
particularly anxious to experience
this transformation perhaps it was
because it was warm weather and
amels bear heavy burdens

  i will change the whole honor-
able assemblage into turkey-buzzards

if it only agrees   continued the con-
jurer   or i will make the lake tung
come up into the town in the shape
of a water-melon and then burst and
overflow everything  

  but we should all be drowned
exclaimed hang-pou who was cow-
ardly as well as intemperate

  thats true said piou-lu but
then you need not fear your cred-
itors-and he gave such a dart of
his long arm at the poor little tailor
that the wretched man thought he
was going to claw him up and change
him into some frightful animal

  well since this illustrious as-
sembly will not have turkey-buzzards
or camels this weak-minded ill-
shapen personage must work a mir-
acle on himself said piou-lu de-
scending from his platform into the
street and bringing with him a little
three-legged stool made of bamboo
rods

  the crowd retreated as he ap-
proached and even the solemn wei-
chang-tze seemed rather afraid of this
miraculous conjurer piou-lu placed
the bamboo stool firmly on the
ground and then mounted upon it

  elegant and symmetrical bamboo
stool he said lifting his arms and
exhibiting something in his hand that
seemed like a piece of polished jade-
stone-elegant and symmetrical
bamboo stool the justly despised
conjurer named piou-lu entreats
that you will immediately grow tall
in the name of the dragon lung  

  truly the stool began to grow in
the presence of the astonished crowd
the three legs of bamboo lengthened
and lengthened with great rapidity
bearing piou-lu high up into the air
as he ascended he bowed gracefully
to the open-mouthed assembly

  it is delightful he cried the
air up here is so fresh i smell the
tea winds from fuh-kien i can see
the spot where the heavens and the
earth cease to run parallel i hear
the gongs of pekin and listen to the
the dragon fang



lowing of the herds of tibet who
would not have an elegant bamboo
stool that knew how to grow   

  by this time piou-lu had risen to
an enormous height the legs of the
slender tripod on which he was
mounted seemed like silkworms
threads so thin were they compared
with their length the crowd began
to tremble for piou-lu

  will he never stop said a
mandarin with a gilt ball named lin

   yes shouted piou-lu from
the dizzy height of his bamboo stool
 yes this ugly little person will
immediately stop elegant stool the
poor conjurer entreats you to stop
growing but he also begs that you
will afford some satisfaction to this
beautifying assemblage down below
who have honored you with their in-
spection 

  the bamboo stool with the utmost
complaisance ceased to lengthen out
its attenuated limbs but on the mo-
ment experienced another change as
terrifying to the crowd the three
legs began to approach each other
rapidly and before the eye could
very well follow their motions had
blended mysteriously and inex-
plicably into one the stool still re-
taining a miraculous equilibrium
immediately this single stem began
to thicken most marvelously and in-
stead of the dark shining skin of a
bamboo stick it seemed gradually to
be incased in overlapping rings of a
rough bark meanwhile a faint rust-
ling noise continued overhead an
when the crowd attracted by the
sound looked up instead of the flat
disk of eanework on which piou-lu
had so wondrously ascended they be-
held a cabbage-shaped mass of green
which shot forth every moment long
pointed satiny leaves of the tenderest
green and the most graceful shape
imaginable but where was piou-lu
some fancied that in the yellow
crown that topped the cabbage-
shaped bud of this strange tree they

could see the tip of his cap and dis-
tinguish his black roguish eyes but
that may have been all fancy and
they were quickly diverted from their
search for the conjurer by a shower
of red pulpy fruits that began to
fall with great rapidity from the
miraculous tree of course there was
a scramble in which the mandarins
themselves did not disdain to join
and the crimson fruits-the like of
which no one in tching-tou had ever
seen before-proved delightfully
sweet and palatable to the taste

  thats right thats right per-
fectly bred and very polite people
cried a shrill voice while they were
all scrambling for the crimson fruits
pick fruit while it is fresh and tea
while it is tender for the sun wilts
and the chills toughen and the bluest
plum blooms only for a day

  everybody looked up and lo there
was piou-lu as large as life strutting
upon the stage waving a large green
fan in his hand while the crowd
was yet considering this wonderful
reappearance of the conjurer there
was heard a very great outcry at the
end of the street and a tall thin man
in a coarse blue gown came running
up at full speed

  where are my plums sons of
thieves he cried almost breathless
with haste alas alas i am com-
pletely ruined my wife will perish
miserably for want of food and my
sons will inherit nothing but empty
baskets at my death where are my
plums   

  who is it that dares to address
the virtuous and well-disposed people
of tching-tou after this fashion
demanded the mandarin lin in a
haughty voice as he confronted the
newcomer

  the poor man seeing the gilt ball
became immediately very humble
and bowed several times to the man-
darin

   my lord said he i am an
incapable and undeserving plum-


weird tales

seller named liho i was just now
sitting at my stall in a neighboring
street selling five cash worth of plums
to a customer when suddenly all the
plums rose out of my baskets as if
ihey had the wings of hawks and flew
through the air over the tops of the
houses in this direction thinking
myself the sport of demons i ran
after them hoping to catch them

and- ah there are my plums

he cried suddenly interrupting him-
self and making a dart at some of the
crimson fruits that the tailor hang
held in his hand intending to carry
them home to his wife

 these your plums screamed
hang defending his treasure vigor-
ously mole that you are did you
ever see scarlet plums

  this man is stricken by heaven
said piou-lu gravely he is a fool
who hides his plums and then thinks
that they fly away let someone shake
his gown

  a porcelain-cobbler who stood near
the fruiterer immediately seized the
long blue robe and gave it a lusty
pull when to the wonder of every-
body thousands of the most beauti-
ful plums fell out as from a tree
shaken by the winds of autumn at
this moment a great gust of wind
arose in the street and a pillar of
dust mounted up to the very top of
the strange tree that still stood wav-
ing its long satiny leaves languidly
above the house-tops for an instant
everyone was blinded and when the
dust had subsided so as to permit the
people to use their eyes again the
wonderful tree had completely van-
ished and all that could be seen was
a little bamboo stool flying along the
road where it was blown by the
storm the poor fruiterer liho
stood aghast looking at the plums in
which he stood knee-deep

 the mandarin addressing him
said sternly let us hear no more
such folly from liho otherwise he
will get twenty strokes of the stick

  ctather your plums liho said
piou-lu kindly and think this one
of your fortunate days for he who
runs after his losses with open mouth
does not always overtake them

 and as the conjurer descended
from his platform it did not escape
the sharp eyes of the little tailor
hang that piou-lu exchanged a mys-
terious signal with the mandarin
wei-chang-tze	i  

 chapter   -
 the shadow of the duck

it was close on nightfall when piou-
lu stopped before wei-chang-
tzes house the lanterns were
already lit and the porter dozed  in
a bamboo chair so soundly that piou-
lu entered the porch and passed the
screen without awaking him the
inner room was dimly lighted by
some horn lanterns elegantly painted
with hunting scenes but despite the
obscurity the conjurer could discover
wei-chang-tze seated at the farther
end of the apartment on an inclined
couch covered with blue and yellow
satin along the corridor that led to
the womens apartments the shadows
lay thick but piou-lu fancied he
could hear the pattering of little feet
upon the matted floor and see the
twinkle of curious eyes illuminating
the solemn darkness yet after all
he may have been mistaken for the
corridor opened on a garden wealthy
in the rarest flowers and he may
have conceived the silver dripping of
the fountain to be pattering of dainty
feet and have mistaken the moon-
light shining on the moist leaves of
the lotus for the sparkle of womens
eyes

  has piou-lu arrived in my dwell-
ing asked wei-chang-tze from the
dim corner in which he lay

  that ignoble and wrath-deserving
personage bows his head before you
answered piou-lu advancing and sa-
the dragon fang



luting the mandarin in accordance
with the laws of the book of rites

  i hope that you performed your
journey hither in great safety and
peace of mind said wei-chang-tze
gracefully motioning to the conjurer
to seat himself on a small blue sofa
that stood at a little distance

  when so mean an individual as
piou-lu is honored by the request of
the noble wei-chang-tze good for-
tune must attend him how could it
be otherwise replied piou-lu seat-
ing himself not on the small blue
sofa but on the satin one which was
partly occupied by the mandarin
himself

  piou-lu did not send in his name
as the rites direct said wei-chang-
tze looking rather disgusted by this
impertinent freedom on the part of
the conjurer

  the elegant porter that adorns
the noble porch of wei-chang-tze was
fast asleep answered piou-lu and
piou-lu knew that the great manda--
rin expected him with impatience

  yes said wei-chang-tze i am
oppressed by a thousand demons
devils sleep in my hair and my ears
are overflowing with evil spirits i
can not rest at night and feel no
pleasure in the day therefore was
it that i wished to see you in hopes
that you would by amusing the de-
mon that inhabits my stomach induce
him to depart

  i will endeavor to delight the re-
spectable demon who lodges in your
stomach with my unworthy conjura-
tions replied piou-lu but first i
must go into the garden to gather
flowers

  go said wei-chang-tze the
moon shines and you will see there
very many rare and beautiful plants
that are beloved by my daughter
wu

  the moonlight itself can not
shine brighter on the lilies than the
glances of your lordships daugh-

ter said the conjurer bowing and
proceeding to the garden

 ah what a garden it was that
piou-lu now entered the walls that
surrounded it were lofty and built
of a rosy stone brought from the
mountains of manchuria this wall
on whose inner face flowery designs
and triumphal processions were
sculptured at regular intervals sus-
tained the long and richly laden
shoots of the white magnolia which
spread its large snowy chalices in
myriads over the surface tamarisks
and palms sprang up in various
parts of the grounds like dark
columns supporting the silvery sky
while the tender and mournful wil-
low drooped its delicate limbs over
numberless fish-ponds whose waters
seemed to repose peacefully in the
bosom of the emerald turf the air
was distracted with innumerable per-
fumes each more fragrant than the
other the blue convolvulus the
crimson ipomea the prodigal azaleas
the spotted tiger-lilies the timid and
half-hidden jasmine all poured forth
during the day and night streams of
perfume from the inexhaustible foun-
tains of their chalices the heavy
odors of the tube-rose floated languid-
ly through the leaves as a richly
plumaged bird would float through
summer air borne down by his own
splendor the blue lotus slept on the
smooth waves of the fish-ponds in
sublime repose there seemed an
odor of enchantment over the entire
place the flowers whispered their
secrets in the perfumed silence the
inmost heart of every blossom was
unclosed at that mystic hour all the
magic and mystery of plants floated
abroad and the garden seemed filled
with the breath of a thousand spells
but amidst the lilies and lotuses
amidst the scented roses and the
drooping convolvuli there moved a
flower fairer than all

 i am here whispered a low
voice and a dusky figure came glid-


weird tales

ing toward piou-lu as he stood by
the fountain

  ah said the conjurer in a ten-
der tone far different from the shrill
one in which he addressed the crowd
opposite the hotel of the thirty-two
virtues the garden is now com-
plete wu the rose of completed
beauty has blossomed on the night
let piou-lu shelter her under his
mantle from the cold winds of eve-
ning and bear her company for a
little while for she has grown up
under a lonely wall said wu lay-
ing her little hand gently on the con-
jurers arm and nestling up to his
side as a bird nestles into the fallen
leaves warmed by the sun

  she can lie there but a little
while   answered piou-lu folding the
mandarins daughter in a passionate
embrace for wei-chang-tze awaits
the coming of piou-lu impatiently in
order to have a conjuration with a
devil that inhabits his stomach
alas said wu sadly why do
you not seek some other and more dis-
tinguished employment than that of
a conjurer why do you not seek
distinction in the palace of literary
composition and obtain a style
then we need not meet in secret and
you might without fear demand my
hand from my father

  piou-lu smiled almost scornfully
he seemed to gain an inch in stature
and looked around him with an air
of command

  the marble from which the statue
is to be carved must lie in the quarry
until the workman finds it he an-
swered and the hour of my destiny
has not yet arrived

  well we must wait i suppose
said wu with a sigh meantime
piou-lu i love you

  the hour will come sooner than
you think said piou-lu returning
her caress and now go for the
mandarin waits

wu glided away through the
gloom to her own apartment
while the conjurer passed rapidly
through the garden and gathered the
blossoms of certain flowers as he
went he seemed to linger with a
strange delight over the buds bathed
in the moonlight and the dew their
perfume ascended into his nostrils
like incense and he breathed it with
a voluptuous pleasure

  now let the demon tremble in the
noble stomach of wei-chang-tze
said piou-lu as he re-entered the hall
of reception laden with flowers

  this ill-favored personage will
make such conjurations as shall de-
light the soul of the elegant and well-
born mandarin and cause his illus-
tiious peiseeutor to fly terrified

  piou-lu then stripped off the petals
from many of the flowers and
gathered them in a heap on the floor
the mass of leaves were indeed varie-
gated the red of the quamoclit the
blue of the convolvulus the tender
pink of the camellia the waxen white
of the magnolia were all mingled to-
gether like the thousand hues in the
scarfs of felicity having built this
confused mass of petals in the shape
of a pyramid piou-lu unwound a
scarf from his waist and flung it over
the heap he then drew the piece of
jade-stone from his pocket and
said-

  this personage of outrageous
presence desires that what will be
may be shown to the lofty mandarin
wei-chang-tze

  as he pronounced these words he
twitched the scarf away with a rapid
jerk and lo the flower-leaves were
gone and in their place stood a beau-
tiful mandarin duck in whose gor-
geous plumage one might trace the
brilliant hues of the flowers piou-lu
now approached the duck caught it
up with one hand while with the
other he drew a sharp knife from his
girdle and severed the birds head
from its body at a single stroke to
the dragon fang



the great astonishment of wei-chang-
tze the body and dismembered head
of the bird vanished the moment the
knife had passed through the neck
but at the same instant a duck re-
sembling it in every respeet escaped
from the eonjurers hands and flew
aeross the room when i say that
this duck resembled the other in
every respect i mean only in shape
size and colors for the rest it was
no bodily duck it was impalpable
and transparent and even when it
flew it made no noise with its wings

  this is indeed wonderful said
wei-ehang-tze let the marvelous
conjurer explain

  the duck formed out of flowers
was a duck pure in body and in spirit
most lofty mandarin said piou-lu
and when it died under the knife i
ordered its soul to pass into its shad-
ow whieh can never be killed henee
the shadow of the duck has all the
colors as well as the intelligence of
the real duck that gave it birth  

  and to what end has the very
wise piou-lu created this beautiful
duek-shadow asked the mandarin

  the cultivated wei-ehang-tze
shall immediately behold answered
the conjurer drawing from his wide
sleeve a pieee of rock-salt and fling-
ing it to the farther end of the room
he had hardly done this when a ter-
rific sound between a bark and a
howl issued from the dim comer into
which he had cast the rock-salt and
immediately a large gray wolf issued
wonderfully from out of the twi-
light and rushed with savage fangs
upon the shadow of the beautiful
duck

  why it is a wolf from the forest
of manchuria exclaimed wei-
chang-tze rather alarmed at this
frightful apparition this is no
shadow but a living and bloodthirsty
beast

  let my lord observe and have no
fear said piou-lu tranquilly

  the wolf seemed rather confounded

when on making a snap at the beau-
tiful duck his sharp fangs met no
resistance while the bird flew with
wonderful venom straight at his fiery
eyes he growled and snapped and
tore with his claws at the agile shad-
ow that fluttered around and over
him but all to no purpose as well
might the hound leap at the reflection
of the deer in the pool where he
drinks the shadow of the beautiful
duck seemed all the while to possess
some strange deadly influence over
the savage wolf his growls grew
fainter and fainter and his red and
flaming eyes seemed to drop blood
his limbs quivered all over and the
rough hairs of his coat stood on end
with terror and pain-the shadow of
the beautiful duck never ceasing all
the time to fly straight at his eyes

  the wolf is dying exclaimed
wei-ehang-tze

  he will die-die like a dog
said piou-lu in a tone of savage tri-
umph

  and presently as he predicted the
wolf gave two or three faint howls
turned himself round in a circle as if
making a bed to sleep on and then
lay down and died the shadow of
the beautiful duck seemed now to be
radiant with glory it shook its
bright wings that were lovely and
transparent as a rainbow and
mounting on the dead body of the
wolf sat in majesty upon his grim
and shaggy throne

  and what means this strange ex-
hibition learned and wise conjurer
asked wei-chang-tze with a sorely
troubled air

  i will tell you said piou-lu
suddenly dropping his respectful and
ceremonious language and lifting his
hand with an air of supreme power
the mandarin duek elegant faith-
ful and courageous is an emblem of
the dynasty of ming the true chinese
race that ruled so splendidly in this
land before the invaders usurped the
throne the eowardly and savage


weird tales

wolf is a symbol of the manchu tar-
tar robbers who slew our liberties
shaved our heads and enchained our
people the time has now arrived
when the duek has recovered its
splendor and its courage and is going
to kill the wolf for the wolf can not
bite it as it works like a shadow in
the twilight and mystery of secret
association this you know wei-
chang-tze as well as i

  i have indeed heard of a rebel
chinese named tien-te who has
raised a flame in our peaceful land
and who proclaiming himself a lineal
descendant of the dynasty of ming
seeks to dethrone our wise and heav-
enly sovereign hien-foung

  lie not to me wei-chang-tze for
i know your inmost thoughts chinese
as you are i know that you hate the
tartar in your heart but you are
afraid to say so for fear of losing
your head

  the mandarin was so stupefied at
this audacious address that he could
not reply while the conjurer con-
tinued i come to make you an of-
fer join the forces of the heaven-
descended emperor tien-te join
with him in expelling this tyrannical
tartar xace from the central king-
dom and driving them back again to
their cold hills and barren deserts
ply with me to the imperial camp
and bring with you your daughter
wu the golden heart of the lily
and i promise you the command of
one third of the imperial forces and
the presidency of the college of cere-
monies  

  and who are you who dare to
ask of wei-chang-tze to bestow on you
his nobly-born daughter said wei-
chang-tze starting in a rage from his
couch

  i replied piou-lu shaking his
conjurers gown from his shoulders
and displaying a splendid garment of
yellow satin on the breast of which
was emblazoned the imperial dragon
-i am your emperor tien-te

  ha screamed a shrill voice be-
hind him at this moment here he is
the elegant and noble rebel for whose
head our worthy emperor has offered
a reward of ten thousand silver taels
here he is catch beautiful and
noble mandarins catch him and i
will pay my creditors with the head
money  

  piou-lu turned and beheld the lit-
tle tailor hang-pou at whose back
were a whole file of soldiers and a
number of mandarins wei-chang-
tze shuddered for in this compromise
of his character he knew that his
death was written if he fell into the
imperial hands

chapter 

all is over

qtately and temperate tailor
 said piou-lu calmly why do
you wish to arrest me

  ho because i will get a reward
and i want to pay my debts said
hang-pou grinning spitefully

  a reward for me the miserable
and marrowless conjurer piou-lu 
elegant cutter of summer gowns your
well-educated brains are not at
home  

   we know you well enough
mighty conjurer you are none
other than the contumacious rebel
tien-te who dares to claim the throne
held by the wise and merciful hien-
foung and we will bear you to the
court of pekin in chains so that you
may wither in the light of his terrible
eyes

  you think you will get a reward
of ten thousand silver taels for my
head said piou-lu

  certainly replied the little
tailor rubbing his hands with glee-
certainly his unmatched and iso-
lated majesty has promised it and
the brother of the sun never lies

metrical seams listen and i will
tell you what will become of your ten

thousand silver taels there is a long
avenue leading to the imperial treas-
ury and at every second step is an
open hand when the ten thousand
taels are poured out the first hand
grasps a half the second hand an
eighth of the remaining half the
third hand grasps a fourth of the
rest and when the money-bags get
down a little lower all the hands
grasp together so that when the bags
reach the little tailor hang-pou who
stands stamping his feet very far
down indeed they are entirely
empty for tartar robbers surround
the throne and a tartar usurper sits
upon it and the great chinese nation
toils in its rice-fields to gild their
palaces and fill their seraglios and
for all they give get neither justice
nor mercy but i tien-te the heav-
enly emperor of this central land
will ordain it otherwise and hurl the
false dragon from his throne for it
is written in the book of prognostics
a copy of which was brought to me on
the wings of a yellow serpent that
the dynasty of han shall rule once
more and the tartar wolves perish
miserably out of the land of flow-
ers  

  this is treason against the light
of the universe our most graeious
emperor said the mandarin lin
you shall have seventy times seven
pounds of cold iron put upon your
neck for these blasphemies and i will
promise you that many bamboo splin-
ters shall be driven up under your
rebellious nails

  let our ears be no longer filled
with these atrocious utterances
cried hang-pou    brave and splen-
did mandarins order your terrifying
tigers to arrest this depraved rebel
in order that we may hasten with
him to pekin  

  before you throw the chains of
sorrow around my neck o tailor of
celestial inspirations said piou-lu
with calm mockery-before the ter-
rible weight of your just hand falls

upon me i pray you if you would
oblige me to look at that duck so
saying piou-lu pointed to where the
shadow of the duck was sitting on the
body of the wolf

  oh what a beautiful duck
cried hang-pou with glistening eyes
and clapping his hands let us try
and catch him 

  it is indeed a majestic duck
said mandarin lin gravely stroking
his mustache i am favorable to
his capture

  you will wait until we catch the
duck illustrious rebel said hang-
pou to piou-lu very innoccntly
never turning his eyes from the duck
to which they seemed to be glued by
some singular spell of attraction

  i will talk with the mandarin
wei-chang-tze while you put your
noble maneuvers into motion an-
swered piou-lu

  now let us steal upon the duck
said hang-pou  handsomely-
formed duck we entreat of you to
remain as quiet as possible in order
that we may grasp you in our
hands  

  then as if actuated by a single
impulse the entire crowd with the
exception of wei-chang-tze and piou-
lu moved toward the duck the
mandarins stepped on tiptoe with
bent bodies and little black eyes
glistening with eagerness hang-pou
crawled on his belly like a serpent
and the soldiers casting aside their
bows and shields crept with their
hands upon their sides toward the
beautiful bird the duck remained
perfectly quiet its variegated wings
shining like painted talc and its neck
lustrous as the court robe of a first-
class mandarin the crowd scarcely
breathed so intense was their eager-
ness to capture the duck and they
moved slowly forward gradually sur-
rounding it

  hang-pou was the first to make a
clutch at the bird but he was very
much astonished to find his hand


weird tales

closing on empty air while the duck
remained seated on the wolf as still
as a picture

  miserable tailor cried manda-
rin lin your hand is a sieve with
meshes wide enough to strain el-
ephants how can you catch the
beautiful duck behold me and
mandarin lin made a rapid and well-
calculated dive at the duck to
the wonderment of everyone except
piou-lu and wei-chang-tze the duck
seemed to ooze through his fingers
and escaping flew away to the other
end of the room

 if my hand is a sieve said
hang-pou it is evident that the
noble mandarins hand is not a wall
of beaten copper for it lets ducks
fly through with wonderful ease
it is a depraved and abominable
duck of criminal parentage said
mandarin lin in a terrible rage
and i vow by the whiskers of the
dragon that i will catch it and burn
it on a spit

   yes cried the entire crowd
-mandarins soldiers and the little
tailor-all now attracted to the chase
of the duck by a power that they
could no longer resist o yes we
will most assuredly capture this little
duck and depriving him of his
feathers punish him on a spit that is
exceedingly hot

 so the chase commenced here
and there from one corner to the
other up the walls on the altar of
die household gods-in short in
every portion of the large room did
ihe mandarins the little tailor and
the soldiers pursue the shadow of the
beautiful duck never was seen such
a duck it seemed to be in twenty
places at a lime one moment man-
darin lin would throw himself bodily
on the bird in hopes of crushing it
nd would call out triumphantly that
now indeed he had the duck but the
words would be hardly out of his
mouth when a loud shout from the
rest of the party would disabuse his

mind and turning he would behold
the duck marching proudly down the
center of the floor another time a
soldier would declare that he had the
duck in his breeches pocket but
while his neighbors were carefully
probing that recess the duck would
be seen calmly emerging from his
right-hand sleeve one time hang-
pou sat down suddenly on the mouth
of a large china jar and resolutely
refused to stir declaring that he had
seen the duck enter the jar and that
he was determined to sit upon the
mouth until the demon of a duck was
starved to death but even while
uttering his heroic determination his
mouthwas seen to openvery wide
and to the astonishment of all the
duck flew out in ani jnstant the
whole crowd was after him again
mandarin hy-le tumbled over man-
darin ching-tze and mandarin lin
nearly drove his head through hang-
pous stomach

the unhappy wretches began now
to perspire and grow faint with
fatigue but the longer the chase went
on the hotter it grew there was no
rest for any of them from corner
to corner from side to side-now in
one direction now in another-no
matter whither the duck flew they
were compelled to follow their faces
streamed and their legs seemed ready
to sink upon them their eyeballs
were ready to start out of their heads
and they had the air of government
couriers who had traveled five hun-
dred li in eleven days they were
nearly dead

  those men will surely perish
illustrious claimant of the throne
said wei-chang-tze gazing with
astonishment at this mad chase

  let them perish said the con-
jurer so will perish all the enemies
of the celestial sovereign tien-te
wei-chang-tze once more do you
accept my offer if yon remain here
the dragon fang



you will be sent to pekin in chains
if you come with me i will gird your
waist with the scarf of perpetual de-
light we want wise men like you to

guide our armies and-

  and the illustrious tien-te loves
the mandarins daughter said wei-
chang-tze roguishly finishing the
sentence light of the universe
and son of heaven wei-chang-tze is
your slave  

  piou-lu-for i still call him by his
conjurers name-gave a low whistle
and obedient to the summons wus
delicate shape came gliding from the
corridor toward her lover with the
dainty step of a young fawn going to
the fountain

  wu said piou-lu the marble
is carved and the hour is come
my father then has consented
said wu looking timidly at her
father

  when the emperor of the cen-
tral land condescends to woo what
father dare refuse said wei-chang-
tze

  emperor said wu opening her
black eyes with wonder my piou-
lu an emperor  

  i am indeed the son of the drag-
on said piou-lu folding her to his
breast and you shall sit upon a
throne of ivory and gold

  and i thought you were only a
conjurer murmured wu hiding
her head in his yellow gown

  but how are we to leave this
place asked wei-chang-tze looking
alarmed the guard will seize us if
they get knowledge of your pres-
ence  

  we shall be at my castle in the

mountains of tse-hing near the
kouei-lin in less than a minute
answered piou-lu for to the pos-
sessor of the dragon fang all things
are possible  

  even as he spoke the ground began
to slide from under their feet with
wonderful rapidity leaving them mo-
tionless and upright houses walls
gardens fields all passed by them
with the swiftness of a dream until
in a few seconds they found them-
selves in the mountain castle of tien-
te where they were welcomed with a
splendid hospitality wu became the
favorite wife of the adventurous em-
peror and wei-chang-tze one of his
most famous generals

  the day after these events some
tartar soldiers entered wei-chang-
tzes house to search for the manda-
rin when in the receptiou-hall they
were confounded at finding a number
of men lying dead upon the floor
while in the midst sat a beautiful
duck that immediately on their
entrance flew out through a window
and was seen no more the dead
men were soon recognized and it was
the opinion of the people of tching-
tou that wei-chang-tze had poisoned
all the soldiers and mandarins and
then fled the tailor hang-pou be-
ing among the corpses was found to
have given his creditors the slip for-
ever

  victory still sits on the banner of
tien-te and he will without doubt
by the time that the tea is again fit
to gather sit upon the ancient throne
of his ancestors

  everything is now gracefully con-
cluded
 if one were asked to name the author whose genius made the weird tale
 popular the instant answer would be edgar allan poe we owe not
 only the weird tale to poe but we are also indebted to him for the word
 itself poe was not the creator of the word   weird   but he rescued it from
 oblivion and made it popular so that now the word is understood and used
 by everyone

     lafcadio hearn in his chapter on poes verse thus describes how poe
 picked up this almost forgotten word and restored it to the language when
 you read in idyls of the king such phrases as the weirdly sculptured gate
 perhaps you have never suspected that the use of the adverb weirdly was
 derived from the study of the american poet there were two words used by
 the saxons of a very powerful kind one referring to destiny or fate the other
 to supernatural terror weird is another form of the anglo-saxon word
 meaning fate the northern mythology like the greek had its fates who
 devised the life histories of men later the word came also to be used in
 relation to the future of the man himself the ancient writers spoke of his
 weird her weird still later the term came to mean simply supernatural
 influence of a mysterious kind poe found it so used and made it into a
 living adjective after it had become almost forgotten by using it very cleverly
 in his poems and stories as he used it it means ghostly or ghostly-looking
 or suggesting the supernatural and occult hundreds of writers imitated

	poe in this respect and now it is so much the rule that the word must be
 used very sparingly it is the mark of a very young writer to use it often  
 weird tales is getting better all the time writes a leslie whose
 verse has been a feature of this magazine i am particularly interested in
 ray cummings new story he is an old favorite of mine and he appears
 to be surpassing himself this time

      ralph raeburn phillips of the order of the star in the east writes to
 the eyrie from portland oregon up till now i have been a silent but
 appreciative reader of weird tales but now i must let you know that here
 is another constant reader and strong supporter of your incomparable mag-
 azine you are doing a good work keep it up we of the great brotherhood
 who love the mystical occult etc could not get along without our weird
 tales give us more good old ghost-stories your contributors are splendid
 i especially like greye la spina and h p lovecraft

     writes s v toomey of east orange new jersey i have been reading
 weird tales for three years and as yet have no fault to find i thought
 
the eyrie



your magazine the most interesting of any until you put in the reprint
stories now i know it is the most interesting cummings latest explorers
into infinity has proved a masterpiece so far but dont you think the install-
ments too short

    i am a new reader of weird tales and want to congratulate you on
the publication of such a splendid magazine writes e e m of birming-
ham alabama in a letter to the eyrie i dont like tales of supernatural
horror but i do like those of imaginative science and pseudo-science such as
explorers into infinity weird tales is the best magazine of its kind in
print

     the snowbird story by carr in the may issue i e phantom fingers
is a real corncracker and gets my vote by a jugful   writes the rev henry s
whitehead from oswego new york

    each month weird tales is improved in some distinct manner writes
jack snow of dayton ohio perhaps it contains some mighty story or it
may be composed of a group of excellent tales but it never fails to bear the
mark of progress please do not even consider discontinuing your reprints
weird tales can find sufficient worthy material from the great library of
the past for one reprint story a month i am taking this opportunity to thank
you for the march issue of weird tales which contained lovecrafts the
white ship it was a beautiful exquisite little story as remotely unreal and
lovecraftean in character as his terror-striking masterpiece the outsider
i wonder how many of your readers truly appreciate beauty of this sort
certainly your publishing material like this raises the magazine many points
as an artistic and worthwhile journal windows of destiny by james b
m clark jr in the april issue is a really remarkable story it is the first
story of its kind i have found in weird tales and it is delightful at times
this tale approaches the fairy-story and it is always an allegory but the
author tells it with prosaic naturalness

    sanford aronow of toms river new jersey writes to the eyrie i
have been a constant reader of your magazine for three years and i like it
better than any other magazine there were many excellent stories in the
may issue it seems that every time you print the magazine it gets better i
picked explorers into infinity first the master of doom for second and
the veiled prophetess third i like ray cummings story tremendously

    private howard a mcelroy writes from the presidio in san francisco
here is how i became a member of the great order of weird tales readers
i was cleaning up the office one night and as i was about to empty the
wastebasket i saw a copy of the august  weird tales and took it and
thought here is something new well i read that copy from back to back
it is entirely different from anything i ever read and i have read thousands
of magazines my two favorite stories in the may issue are the master of
doom by donald edward keyhoe and in kashlas garden by oscar schisgall
they are weirdly beautiful

    here is a real knock from mrs r snyder of reading pennsylvania
dear sirs i have been reading weird tales for years i have a habit of
saying what i think right out so dont get cross at what i write to you but
you want to snap out of it you are loseing your trade you print some
stories that is not interesting you have so many abut destroying the earth
and killing all the peopel thats not interesting at all besides your stories


weird tales

are nearly alike only here and there a littel diffrent did you ever read
ghost stories  well you want to thems the spooky creepy stories like the weird
laics useto have lots of my friends dropet your magazine if you could gave
us more ghost stories you would be o k what is better than to read a
creepy ghost storie at night give us more of seabury quinn and greye la
spina allso maria moravsky espesly seabury quinn

    c t byrd of des moines iowa writes i suggest that you print from
old books of magic a chapter or two in each issue in place of the reprint
stories it would also be a good plan i think to have a department in which
the readers can write their own experiences in the land of the occult and
weird

    i can not say enough for weird tales writes miss laura johnson
of cincinnati i have just recently begun to read the magazine and i
have never in all my reading of books and magazines come upon one that
i admired so immensely

    the three best stories ever published which i have read writes fred
w fischer jr of knoxville tennessee were these ever-to-be-remembered -
with-pleasure stories from weird tales  when the green star waned by
nictzin dyalhis  invaders from outside by j schlossel  a runaway
world by clare winger harris by the way-about a year ago you forecast
a tale entitled other worlds by will smith why has it never been men-
tioned since will it ever be published editors note yes it will

    the master of doom by donald edward keyhoe is about tied with the
second installment of ray cummings serial explorers into infinity for

the return of the
master

continued from page 

while he slunk toward the door
revenge i cried and the hell-
hound sprang

  straight for the masters throat he
leapt but seized instead the arm that
was flung across it i heard a dull
crack and i knew the bone was
broken he staggered with the blow
groaned and sank to his knees

  the beast shifted his hold and
grappled for the throat again this
time he succeeded but i could see
that the fangs did not penetrate the
skin he toyed with the vampire as
a cat with a mouse with one great
paw on the masters chest he held
him flat and snarled in his face

  tasting to the full a revenge that
had burned hot for many years he
delayed the deatn-stroke too long a
new factor was introduced into the
struggle 

  pierre the hulking mass of brain-
less muscle lunged forward clutch-
ing the beast by the loins although
the creature snapped fiercely at his
arms with blood pouring down his
sides from his wounds he began to
raise the hungarian above his head
slowly as moves a ponderous machine

  under the will of the master the
corpse was energized with movement
and was operating as directed by the
vampire

  into my brain poured commands
and i knew they issued from the in-
visible company many voices but
qll urged hurl the lamp they
can not pass the flame

  but brenryk i thought

  he will not be harmed they an-
swered   he lives in this shape only
by our wish

  and pierre i queried silently
  he is dead was the reply

  gray ghouls

continued from page 

disabled launch to port and during
that time tom mansey recovered
from a siege of sub-consciousness and
fever in which he raved and fought
a nightmare jungle peopled with gray
ghouls and when some time later he
made a report to the authorities it
contained prophecy and prediction

   it is fairly well established that
wherever the white man goes it
means elimination of the savage not
by slaughter of course we have
subtler ways and the higher type
of skill and brains you send in the
quicker you set the death-dealing
forces to work among the natives
compared with one courageous
brainy white man cobras crocodiles
tigers any of the jungle terrors are
simple and innocuous i know as
regards moneyed idiots who were pro-
moting head barter fine them enough
and jail them cut off the demand
and you kill the supply

  they rewarded mansey rather well
for that investigation although r
the launch bottom the tonga boy 
gathered a kings ransom in pearls
from strands which broke as mullet
struggled to escape death they were
rather honest tonga boys and only
thieved half of the pearls to divide
among themselves but mansey is
barrassed pearls belong to
throats of pretty women but those
pearls held memories too horrid to
give to a nice girl so he is waiting to
trade them to curio-hunters disap-
pointed at lack of mummied human

mission finished his last look was
one of gratitude to me

  then the walls began to crumble
pierre went down struck by a fall-
ing beam and the scene was blotted
out in a whirling veil of sparks

  as i dragged myself and regina to
safety i saw that it was gray dawn
and people were running from the
village to stare open-mouthed at the
sudden flames and i knew no more

isit in my chair and read the words
i have just written it seems a
dream that i shudder out of but all
is well now

  we explained to the people that
passing by the haunted inn i saw the
girl in the grasp of a tramp that i
fought to rescue her and in the
scuffle upset a lamp some i think
believed the story but i saw others
furtively cross themselves and all
were glad to see us go

  part of the story i revealed to the
village priest under pledge of se-
crecy he pronounced anathema
upon the ruins but i doubt that it
was of much value i place more
faith in the whining wind that rose
and scattered those ashes far and
wide it will be a powerful magic
that brings together that dread
world-wanderer again

 regina i brought with me to
america from this time my life is
hers as my wealth shall be when i am
gone

  here i shall dwell in this pleasant
new england town and i rove no
more

  happier times are in prospect for
the unhappy girl even on board
ship i noticed that the haggard face
was losing its wrinkles and careworn
look good food and rest are bring-
ing back the roses to her cheeks she
is young and youth is elastic
