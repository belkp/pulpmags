the electric cure
is popular

as pleasant as it is effective

it is grand to put on an electric battery whil
lying down resting and feel its exhilaratftjl
influence in every nerve and muscle the
is no inconvenience attached to it in an
way one hours daily application is suffictan
there is not the slightest shock or irritattqft
but a gentle soothing warmth that goes dired
to the nerve centres that kind of electric
cures and the cure it gives is permanent

   people will sometimes try an ordinary hatteo
made no doubt for commercial purposes 
a shocking current which irritates the nerve
and conclude that electricity is not suitable
it will not do any good in that form tv
current must be given without shock-witbfll
irritation of any kind-and in this way the verf
weakest individuals can be built up

  no one is too weak to use electricity i
such cases a longer building-up process is f-
quired but the results arc just as certain s
water is to extinguish fire when applied fl
sufficient quantities if a proper battery 
used it is possible to supply a very strs
current free from all inconveniences ho
much more pleasant it is to be cured in
way while resting tlian to be pouring nteir
tine into the poor weakened stomach until l
is impossible to do without it this drug haki
grows on one like the whisky habit and

this poem hu been written by mr rudyard kipling specially
for tho firt number of  hutchinsons story magazine

to him who made the heavens abide and gave the stars
their motion

to him who tames the moonstruck tide twice a day round
   ocean-

let his name be magnified in all poor folks devotion

xot for prophecies and powers visions gifts or graces

but the weighed and counted hours that drive us to our plaecs
with the burden on our backs the weather in our faces



not for any miracle of easy loaves and fishes

but for standing gainst our will at work against our wishes-

such as finding food to fill daily-emptied dishes

                                           ix
 hutchinsons story magazine

not for voices harps or wings or rapt illumination

but the grosser self that springs of use and occupation

unto which the spirit clings as her last salvation

he who launched our ship of fools many anchors gave us

lest one gale shculd start hum all or one groundsuell slave us
     praise him for the petty creeds
     that prescribe in paltry needs

solemn riles to trivial deeds and by small things save us

heart may fail and strength outwear and purpose turn to loathing
but the everyday affair of toilette meals and clothing

builds a bulkhead twixt despair and the edge of nothing

praise him then who orders it that though earth be flaring
     and the crazy skies arc lit
     by the searchlights of the pit

man should not depart a whit from his wonted bearing

they that sip from every glass lose their heads the faster

they that skip from thought to thought suffer like disaster

     and in all adversity

    having nothing orderly

let  he accepted time go by till panic is their master 
rudyard kipling

he who bids the wild-swans host still maintain their flight on
    air-roads over islands lost-

    ages since neath ocean lost-

beaches of some sunken coast their fathers would alight on

    shall guide us through this dark not by new shown glories
but by every ancient mark our fathers used before us

till our children ground their ark where the proper shore is

and he who makes the mountains smoke and rives the hills

        asunder

    and to-morrow leads the grass-

   mere unconquerable grass-

the talisman

i think it was the old egyptians a
very wise people probably indeed
 much wiser than we know for in the
leisure of their ample centuries they had
time to think out things who declared that
ach individual personality was made up
six or seven dilierent elements although

	think the bible only allows ns three-
nely body soul and spirit the body
that the man or woman wore if i under-
stand their theory aright which perhaps t
n ignorant person do not was but a kind
jl sack or fleshly covering containing these
afferent principles or mayhap it did not
ijwxtain them at all but was simply a
house as it were in which they lived from
tone to time and seldom all together al-
though one or more of them was present
cqbtinuady as though to keep the place
afincd and aired

  this is but a casual illustrative sugges-
tion for what right have i allan quatcr-
in out of my lvttle reading and prob-
jty erroneous deductions to form any
judgment as to the theories of the old
ptians  still these as i understand

k m uce  rush m wth a trxt

hat man i not one but manv in which
ancction it may be remembered that

tltrt story li been itiln

often in scripture he is spoken of as being
the home of many demons seven  think
and to come to a far different example
that the zulus talk of their witch-doctors
as being inhabited by a multitude of
spirits

  now the reason of all this homily is that
i allan the most practical and unim-
aginative of persons just a homely half-
educated hunter and trader who chances
to have seen a good deal of the particular
little world in which my lot was cast at
one period of my life became the victim
of spiritual longings i am a man who
has coffered great bereavements in ray
time such as have seared my soul since
perhaps because of my rather primitive
and simple nature my affections are very
strong i can never forget those whom i
have loved and whom  believe to have
loved me

  for home years of my lonely existence
these problems haunted me day by day
till at length i desired above everything
tih earth to lay them at rest in one way or
another

   was in zululand about this time and
being near the black kloof where he dwelt
i paid a visit to my acquaintance of whom i
have written rucwhere the wonderful and
ancient dwarf zikali known a  the-

thing- that-should-never-have-been -bom
also more cjmmonly among the zulus as
 opener of roads when we had talked
of many things connected with the state
of zululand and its politics i decided to
consult him on the problems that had been
troubling me

   you are named  opener of roads
are you not zikali   i said

   yes the zulus have always called me
that since before the days of chaka but
what of names which often enough mean
nothing at all  

    only that i want to open a road zikali
that which runs across the river of death
 oho   he laughed  it is very easy
and snatching up a little assegai that lay
beside him he proffered it to me adding
 be brave now and fall on that then
before  have counted sixty the road will
be wide open but whether you will see
anything on it  cannot tell you

  again i shook my head and answered

    it is against our law also while  still
live i desire to know whether i shall meet
ccrtain others on that road after my time
has come to cross the river perhaps you
who deal with spirits can prove the matter
to me which no one else seems able to do
 oho i  laughed zikali again  what
do my ears hear  am i the poor zulu
cheat asked to show that which is hidden
from all the wisdom of the great white
people  

   the question is i answered with
irritation  not what you are asked to do
but what you can do

   that  do not know yet macumazahn
what spirits do you desire to see  if that
of a woman called mameena  is one of
them  think that perhaps i whom she

loved-

   she is not one of them zikali more-
over if she loved you you paid back her
love with death

   which perhaps was the kindest thing
i could do macumazahn for reasons that
you may be able to guess and others with
which  will not trouble you but if nut
hers whose  let me look i-let me look 
i will tell you a secret all seers who hve
at the same time if they are great com-
mune with each other because they are
akin and their spirits meet in sleep or
dreams therefore  know of a certain
mistress cf our iraft a very lioness among
jackals who for thousands of years has lain
sleeping in the northern caves and humble
though  am she knows of me

   for tbe history of maoctnt m the book
called child of storm

   quite so i said yawning  but per-
haps zikali you will come to the point of 
the spear what of her  how is she
named and if she exists will she help 
me  

   i will answer your questions back-
wards macumazahn- i think that she will
help you if you help her in what way i do
not know because although witch doctor 
sometimes work without pay as i am
doing now macumazahn witch-doctoresse i
never do as for her name the only one
that she lias aiming our company is

	queen because she is the first of all of
them and the most beauteous among
women for the rest i can tell yon no- 
thing except that she has always been 
and i suppose in this shape or in that will i
always be while the world lasts because
she has found the secret of life unending 

   you mean that she is an immortal
zikali i answered with a smile

    do not say that macumazahn be-
cause my little mind cannot shape the
thought of immortality but when i was 
a babe which is far ago she had lived so x
long that scarce would she know the diner- 
ence between then and now and already
in her breast was all wisdom gathered  j
know it because although as i have said
we have never seen each other at times
we talk together in our sleep for thus she
shares her loneliness and  tlunk though 
this may be but a dream that last night she
told me to send you on to her to seek an
answer to certain questions which you
would put to me to-day

  now i grew angry and asked

   why does it please you to fool me
zikali with such talk as this  if there is
any truth in it show me where the woman
called queen lives and how i am to come
to her

  the old wizard took up the little assegai
which he had offered to me and with its
blade raked out ashes from the fire that
always burnt in front of him while he did
so he went on talking to me as i thought
in a random fashion perhaps to distract my
attention of a certain white man whom he
said i should meet upon my journey and
of his auairs also of other matters none of 
which interested me much at the time 
these ashes he patted down flat and then 
on them drew a map with the point of his 
spear making grooves for streams certain j
marks for bush and forest wavy lines for j
water or swamps and little heaps for hills i
when he bad finished it all he bade me j
come round the fire and study the picture j
across which by an afterthought he drew


rider haggard

a wavering furrow with the edge of the
aegai to represent a river and gathered
the ashes in a lump at the northern end to
signify a large mountain

    look at it well macumazahn he
aid  and forget nothing since if you
ake this journey and forget you die
o no need to copy it in tat book of
yours for see i will stamp it oyour mind
then suddenly he gathered up the hot
shes in a double handful and threw them
my face muttering something as he
did so and adding aloud

    there now you will remember

    certainly i shall i answered cough-
 mg  and i beg that you will not play
 sch a joke upon me again

   as a matter of fact whatever may have
 en the reason i never forgot any detail
 fthat extremely intricate map

    that big river must be the zambesi
  stuttered  and even then the mountain
 your queen ii it be her mountain is far
 way and how can  come there alone  
   dont know macumazahn though
 perhaps you might do so in company at
 east  bc-lieve that in the old days people
 sed to travel to the place since once 
 av heard a great city stood there which
 was the heart of a mighty empire

   now i pricked up my ears for though

 	believed nothing of zikalis story of a
 wonderful queen i was always intensely
 wtercsted in past civilisations and their
 julies also i knew that old zikalis know-
 ledge was extensive and peculiar however
 - came by it and  did not think that he
 would lie to me in this matter indeed to
 tell the truth then and there i made up
 y mind that if it were in any way pos-
 sible i would attempt this journey

    how did people get to the city zikali
    by sea  suppose macumazahn but

 	think that you will be wise not to try that
 rd since  behove that on the seaside
 ge marshes are now impassable and 
 think you will be safer on your feet

    you want me to go on this adventure
 zikali why  for  know you never do
 nytiling without motive

   oho  macumazahn you are clever
nd see deeper into the trunk of a tree than
ost yes i want you to go for three
a-ons first that yon may satisfy your
ul on certain matters and i would help
secondly became i want to satisfy
ne and thirdly because i know that
you will come back safe to be a prop to
in things that will happen in days un-
born otherwise  would have told you
athing of this story tincc it is necessary

to me that you should remain living beneath

the sun

   have done zikali what is it that
you desire  

   oh a great deal that  shall get but
chiefly two things so with the rest i will
not trouble you first i desire to know
whether these dreams of mine of a wonder-
ful white witch-doctoress or witch and of
my converse with her are indeed more
than dreams next  would learn whether
certain plots of mine at which i have
worked for years will succeed

   what plots zikali -and how can my
taking a distant journey tell you anything
about them  

   you know them well enough macuma-
zahn  they have to do with the overthrow
of a royal hjuse tliat has worked me bitter
wrong as to how your journey can help
me why thus you shall promise to me
to ask of this queen whether zikali opener
of roads shall triumph or be overthrown
in that on which he has set his heart

   as you seem to know this witch so well
why do you not ask her yourself zikali  
 to ask is one thing macumazahn to
get an answer is another  have asked
in the watches of the night and the reply
was  come hither and perchance i will
tell you  queen i said  how can i
come save in the spirit who am an ancient
and a crippled dwarf scarcely able to stand
upon my feet  

    then send a messenger wizard and
be sure that he is white for ol black savages
 have seen more than enough let him
bear a token also that he comes from you
and tell me of it in your sleep moreover
let that tokeu be something of power which
will protect him on the journey

    such is the answer that comes to me
in my dreams macumazahn

   well what token will you give me
zikali  

  he groped about in his robo and pro-
duced a piece of ivory of the size of a large
chessman that had a hole in it through
which ran a platted cord of the still hairs
from an elephants tail on this article
which was of a rusty brown colour he
breathed then having whimpered to it for
a while handed it to me

  i took the talisman for such i guessed
it to be idly enough held it to the light to
examine it and started back so violently
that almost  let it fall i do not quite
know why i started but  think it was
because some influence berated to leap
from it to me zikali started also and
cried out


hutchinsons story magazine

   have a care macumazahn am i
young that i can bear being dashed to the
ground  

  what do you mean   i asked still
staring at the thing which i perceived to
be a most wonderfully fashioned likeness
of tho old dwarf himself as he appeared
before me crouched upon the ground
there were the deepset eyes the great head
the toad-like shape the long hair all

   when that ivory is hung over your
heart macumazahn where you must al-
ways wear it learn that with it goes the
strength of zikali the thought that would
have been his thought and the wisdom that
is his wisdom will be your companions as
much as though he walked at your side
and could instruct you in every peril
moreover north and south and cast and
west this image is known to men who
when they sec it will bow down and obey
opening a road to him who wears the
mcdicinc of the opener of roads

   indeed i said smiling  and what
is this colour on the ivory  

   i forget macumazahn who have had
it a great number of years ever since it
descended to me from a forefather of mine
who was fashioned iti the same mould as
i am it looks like blood does it not 
it is a pity that mainecna is not still alive
since she whose memory was so excellent
might have been able to tell you and as
he spoke with a motion that was at once
sure and swift he threw the loop of ele-
phant hair over my head

  hastily  changed the subject feeling
that after his wont tliis old wizard the
most terrible man whom ever  knew who
had been so much concerncd with the
tragic death of mameena was stabbing at
me in some hidden fashion

   you tell me to go on this journey i
said  and not alone and yet for com-
panion you give me only an ugly piece of
ivory shaped as no man ever was  litre 
got one back at zikali  and from the
look of it steeped in blood which ivory if
i had my way i would throw into the
camp fire who then am i to take with
me  

   dont do that macumazahn- mean
throw the ivory into the fire since i have
no wish to burn before my time and li
you do you who have worn it might burn
with me at least certainly you would
die with the magic thing and go to acquire
knowledge more quickly than you desire
no no do not try to take it off your neck
or rather try if you will

  i did try but something seemed to pre-

vent me from accomplishing my purpose
of giving the carving back to zikali as 
wished to do first my pipe got in the
way of my hand then the elephant hairs
caught in the collar of my coat then a
pang of rheumatism to which  was accus-
tomed from an old injury developed of a
sudden in my left arm and lastly i seemed
to grow tired of bothering about the thing

  zikali who had been watching my move-
ments burst out into one of his terrible
laughs that seemed to fill the whole kloof
and re-echo from its rocky walls it died
away and he went on without further
reference to the talisman or image

   you asked who you were to take with
you macumazahn well as to this i
must make inquiry of those who know
man my medicines  

  from the shadows in the hut behind
darted out a tall figure carrying a great
spear in one hand and in the other a cat-
skin bag which with a salute he laid down
at the feet of his ma-ster this salute by i
the way was that of a zulu word which 
means  lord or  home of ghosts

  zikali groped in the bag and produced 
from it certain knucklebones

   a common method lie muttered i
 such as every vulgar wizard uses but one
that is quick and as the matter concerned j
is small will serve my turn let us tee
now whom you shall take with youj
macumazahn

  he breathed upon the bones shook j
them up in his thin hands and with a j
quick turn of the wrist threw them into
the air then he studied them carefully
where they lay among the ashes he had j
raked out of the fire those which he had
used for the drawing of his map

   do you know a man named umslopo-
gaas macumazahn the chief of a tnbe tbati
is called the people of the axe whose
titles of praise arc bulalio or the slangh-
terer and woodpecker the latter from the
way he handles his axe  he is a savage
fellow but one of high blood and highcf
courage a great captain in his way though
he will never come to anything save a
glorious death-in your company i think
macumazahn here hcstudied the bone
again for a while  yes i am sure i
your company though not upon this jour-
ney i think that this wolf-man this axe-
man this warrior umslopogpas would b
a good fellow to you on your journey to
visit the white witch queen

   i have heard of him i answered cau-
tiously  it is said in the land tliat he i
a son of chaka  is there any one else  i
rider haggard

  alkali glanced at the bones again pok-
ng them about in the ashes with his toe
then replied with a yawn

 vou seem to have a little yellow man
youx service a clever snake who knows
now to creep through grass and when to
strike and when to lie hidden i should
him too if i were you

   you know well that i have such a
iljn zikali a hottentot named hans
able in his way but drunken very faith-
ful too since he loved my father before
nie he is cooking my supper at the
wagon now are there to be any others  
 xo i think you three will be enough
rith a guard of soldiers from the people
 the axe for you will meet with fight-
ing and a ghost or two

  here of a sudden ho shivered violently
and cried   slave bring me my blanket it
grows cold and my medicine also that
inch protects me from the ghosts who
are thick to-night macumazahn brings
them  think oho-ho  

  then he waved his hand to dismiss me
and i went wondering

chapter 

the messengers

 tiu not rest as  should that night some-
how i was never able to sleep well in the
neighbourhood of the black kloof i sup-
pose that zikalis constant talk about
ghost with his hints and innuendoes con-
cerning those who were dead always af-
fected my nerves till in a subconscious
ay  began to believe that such things
listed and were hanging about me many
people are open to the power of suggestion
d i am atraid that i am one ol them
however the sun which has such strength
to kill noxious things puts an end to
ghosts more quickly even than it does to
rther evil vapours and emanations and
hen i woke up to find it shining brilliantly
 a pure heaven i laughed with much
heartiness over the whole affair

  going to the spring near which we were
jut--panued  took os my shirt to have a
good wash still chuckling at the memory
all the hocus-pocus of my old friend the
opener of roads
while engaged in this matutinal opera-
tion i struck my hand against sometluug
d looking observed that it was the
wdeous little ivory image of zikali which
h had set about my ncck the sight of
thi thing and the memory oi his ridiculous
 about it epcciullv ol his aserti-m
hat it had cmuc down to him through

the ages which it could not have done
seeing that it was a likeness of himself
irritated me so much that i proceeded to
take it oil with the lull intention of throw-
ing it into the spring as i was in the act
of doing this from a clump of reeds mixed
with bushes quite close to me there came
a sound of hissing and suddenly above
them appeared the head of a great black
mamba perhaps the deadliest of all our
african snakes and the only one  know
which will attack man without provoca-
tion

  leaving go of the image  sprang back
in a great hurry towards where my gun
lay then the snake vanished and mak-
ing sure that it had departed to its hole
which probably was at a distance i re-
turned to the pool and once more began
to take oil the talisman in order to consign
it to the bottom of the pool

  after nil  reflected it was a hideous
and probably a blood-stained thing which
i did not in the least wish to wear about
my neck like a ladys love-token

  just as it was coming over my head
suddenly from the other side of the bush
that infernal snake popped up again tins
time it was clear really intent on busmc

it began to move towards me in the light-
ning-like way mambas have hissing and
flicking its tongue  was too quick for my
friend however for snatching up the gun
that  had laid down beside me i let it 
have a charge of buckshot in the neck which
nearly cut it in two so that it fell down and
expired with hideous convulsive writhing

  hearing the shot hans came running
from the wagon to see what was the matter
hans i should say was that same hotten-
tot who had been the companion of most
of my joumeyings since my fathers day
he was with me when as a young fellow 
accompanied retief to dingaans kraal
and like myself escaped the massacre
also we shared many other adventures in-
cluding the great one in the land of the
ivory child where be slew the huge ele-
phant god jana and himself was slain
but of t his journey we did not dream in
those days

  for the rest hans was a most entirely
unprincipled person but as the- boers say

 as clever as a wagonload of monkey
also he drank when he got the chance
one good quality he had however  no man
was ever more faithful and perhaps it
would be true to say that neither man nor
woman ever loved me unworthy quite so
well in nppimisce he rather resembled

         	sc<- tt»« tw»>k alled mam
hutchinsons story magazine

an antique and dilapidated baboon his
face was wrinkled like a dried nut and his
quick little eyes were bloodshot i never
knew what his age was any more than he
did liimsolf but years liad left him tough
as whipcord and absolutely untiring
lastly he was perhaps the best hand at
following a spoor that ever i knew and
up to a hundred and fifty yards or so a
very deadly shot with a rifle especially
when he used a little single-barrelled
muzzlo-loading gun of mine made by pur-
dey which he named inlotnbi or maiden
of that gun however i have written in
the holy flower and elsewhere

   what is it baas   he asked  here
there are no lions nor any game

   look the other side of the bush hans
he slipped round it making a wide circle
with his usual caution then seeing the
snake-which by the way was i think the
biggest mamba i ever killed-suddenly
froze as it were in a stiff attitude that re-
minded me of a pointer when ho scents
game having made sure that it was
lead he nodded and said

   black mamba nr so you would call it
though i know it for something else

   whbt else hans  

   one of the old witch-doctor zikalis
spirits which he set at the mouth of this
kloof to warn him who comes or goes i
know it well and so do others  saw it
listening behind a stone when you were up
the kloof last evening talking with the
opener of roads

   then zikali will lack a spirit i an-
swered laughing  which perhaps he will
not miss amongst so many it serves him
right for setting the brute on me

   quite so baas he will bo angry i
wonder why he did it   he added sus-
piciously  seeing that he is such a friend
of yours

   he didnt do it at all hans these
snakos are very fierce and give battle that
is all

  hans paid no attention to my remark
which probably he thought only worthy
of a white man who does not understand
but rolled his yellow bloodshot eyes about
as though in search of explanations pre-
sently they fell upon the ivory that hung
about my neck and he started

   why do you wear that pretty likene
of the great one y nder over your heait
as i have known you do with thing that
belonged to women in psst days baas 
do you not know that it is zikalia great
medicine as every one does throughout the
land  when zikali sends an order tar

away he always sends that image with iu
for then he who receives the order knov
that he must obey or die also the me
senger knows that he will come to no liarifl
if he does not take it off bccanse baa
the image is zikali himself and zikali i
the image they are one and the same
also it is the imago of his fathers father
father-or so he says

   that is an odd story i said then
f told hans as much n i thought advisable
of how this horrid little talisman came into
my posset-sion

  hans nodded without showing any sur-
prise

   so we are going on a long journey he
said  well baas  thought it was timl
that we did sometlung more than waide
about these tame countries selling blanket
to stinking old women and so forth

  to myself i determined however not
only that  would not travel north to seek
that which no living man will ever find
certainty as to the future but also to show
my independence of zikali that i w uld
not visit this chief umslop gaas so
having traded all my goods and made a fair
profit on paper  set myself to return to
natal proposing to rest awhile in my little
house at durban and told hans my mind

   very good baas he said  i too
should iike to go to durban there art
lots of things there that we cannot get
here and he fixed his roving eye upon a
square-face gin bottle which as it happened
was filled with nothing stronger thaof
water because all the gin vas drunk
 yet baas we shall not see the berea log
a long while

   why do you say that   uvkedi-
sharply

   oh  baas i dont know but yon went-
to visit the opener of roads did you not
and he told you to go north and lent voo
the great medicine did he not   and
hans proceeded to light hi corncob pipe
with an ash from the fire all the time keep-
ing his beady eyes fixed upon that part of
mewhere he knew the talisman was hangings

   quite true hans but now  mean u
show zikali that i am not his messenger
for s uth or north or jiast or west so
to-morrow morning we cross the river and
trek for natal

   yes baas but then why not cross it
this evening  there will  till be light j

   i have said that we cross it to-monr
morning i answered with that fimines
which i have read always indicate a nafl
of character  and i do not change mv
word


	baas but sometimes other tilings

 wiangc besides -words will the baas have
 at buck s leg for supper or the stuff out of

 	tin with a dim in it which we bought at a
 tore two years ago  the flies have gct at the
 oucki leg but i cut out tho bit with the
 kota on it and ate it myself

   hans was right things do change especially
 te weather that night unexpectedly for
 l cn i turned in the ky seemed quite serene
 uc came a terrible rain long before it was
 oc which lasted off and on for three whole
 and continued intermittently for an in-
 jh-ntta pcriod- needless to say the river
 thv u would have been so easy to cross on
  particular evening by the morning was a
 i gjghg torrent and so remained for several
 sww in despair at length i trekked south
 here a ford was reported which when
 clied proved impracticable i tried another
 dozen miles farther on which was very hard
 cotne to over boggy land it looked all
 ta  aiij wc wcre getting across finely when
 ffjjjenly one of the wheels sank in an unsus-
 gyed hole and here we stuck indeed i
 mieve the wagon  bits of it would have
 plained in tlie neighbourhood of that ford to
 day had i not managed to borrow some
 ra oxen belonging to a christian kaffir and
 jto their help to drag it back to the bank
 hence we had started

as ithapimned i was only just in time since

 	new storm which had burst farther ilp the
 nver brought it down in flood again a very
 evy lod

 after this i confessed myself beaten and gave
 svntil such time as it should please provi-
 to turn off uw water-tap trekking out
 ght of that infernal river which annoyed
 f with its constant gurgling i camped on
  comparatively dry spot that overlooked a
 autiful litretch of rolling veld towards
 the clouds lifted and i saw a mile or
 i away a most extraordinary mountain on
 i s lower slopes of which grew a dense forest

     upper part which was of bare rock looked
 gctly hkc a seated figure of a grotesque
 with the chin resting on the breast
 e warn the head there were the arm there
 i the knees indeed the whole mass of
 mwiiuiltid me strongly of the effigy of zikali
 fqkh was tied about my neck or rather of
 kau himself

 jv hat is that called   i said to hans

          to tiu strange hill now blaring with
 r angry fire of the setting un that had burst
 igjbetwcen the storm clouds and made it
 more ominous even than before
 y that is the witch mountain baas where

   where then lives the chief umslopogaas  

   they say his town is yonder on the plain
baas it is called tho place of the axe and
strongly fortified with a river round most of it
and his people arc the people of the axe they
are a fierce people and all the country round
here is so uninhabited because umslopogaas
has cleaned out the tribes who used to live in
it first with his wolves and afterwards in
war he is so strong a chief and so terrible
in battle that even chaka himself was afraid
of him and dingaan the king they say he
brought to his end because of a quarrel about
this nada cetywayo the present king loo
leaves hini alone and to him he pays no tri-
bute

  whilst i wan about to ask hans from whom
he had collected all this information suddenly
i heard sounds and looking up saw three tall
men clad in full heralds drcas rushing towards
us at great speed

   here come some chips from the axe
said hans and promptly bolted into the wagon

  i did not bolt because there was no time to
do so without loss of dignity but although i
wished i had my rifle with me just sat still
upon my stool and with great deliberation
lighted my pipe taking not the slightest notice
oi the three savage-looking fellows these men
that i noted carried axes instead of assegais
rushed straight at me with the axes raised in
such a fashion that any one unacquainted with
the habits of zulu warriors of the old school
might have thought that they intended no-
thing short of murder as i expected how-
ever within about six feet of me they halted
suddenly and stood there still as statues for
my part i went on lighting my pipe as though
 did not see them and wlion at length i was
obliged to lift my head surveyed them with
an air of mild interest then i took a little
book out of my pocket it was my favourite
copy of thelrgoldsby legends and bcan to read

  this proceeding astonished them a good deal
who felt that they had so to speak missed fire
at last the soldier in the middle said

   are you blind white man  

   no black fellow i answered  but 
am short-sighted would yon be so good as
to stand out of my light a remark which
puzzled them so much that all three drew back
a few paces

  when i had read a little farther i shut up
the book and remarked

   if you arc wanderers who want food as
i lodge by yonr being o thin i ant sorry that
i have little meat but my servants will give
you what they can

   ow t  said tho spokesman  he calls as
wanderers i either he must be a very great
man or he is road

   you are right i am m great man i
answered yawning  and if you trouble mo
too much you will sec that i can be mad also
now what do you want  

   we are messengers from the great chief
umslopogaas captain of the people of the
axs and we want tribute answered the man
in a somewhat changed tone


hutchinsons story magazine

      do you  then you wont get it i
  thought that only the king of zululand had a
  right to tribute and your captains name is
  not cetywayo is it  

      our captain is king here said the man
  still more uncertainly

       is he indeed  xlien away with you back
  to him and tell this king of whom i never
  heard though  have a message for a certain
  lmslopogaas that macumazahn watcher by
  night will visit him to-morrow if he will send
  a guide at the first light to show the bet path
  for the wagon

      hearken said the man to his companions
    this is macumazahn himself well we

  thought it for no other would have dared-

     then they saluted with their axes calling
  me chief and other fine names and departed
  as they had come at a run calling out that
  my message should be delivered and that
  doubtless the chief would send the guide

     so it came about that quite contrary to my
   intention after all circumstances brought me
   to the town of the axe even at the last
   moment i had not meant to go there but
   when the tribute was demanded  saw that it
   was best to do so and having once passed my
   word it could not be altered  indeed i felt
   sure that in this event there would be trouble
   and that my oxen would be stolen or worse

     so pate having issued its decree of which
  hanss version was tliat zikali or his great
  medicine had so arranged things i shrugged
  my shoulders and waited

ulapter 

lmslopogaas ok the axe

  next morning at the dawn guides arrived from
  tile town of the axe bringing with them a
  yoke of spare oxen which showed that its
  thief was really anxious to see me so in due
  course we insponned and started the guide
  leading us by a rough but practicable road
  down the steep hillside to the saucerlike plain
  beneath where i saw many cattle grazing
  travelling soinc miles across this plain wc
  came at last to a river of no great breadth
  that encircled a considerable kaffir town on
  three sides the fourth being protected by a
  little line of koppies which were joined to-
  gether with walls also the placc was strongly
  fortified with fences and in every other way
  known to tho native mind

     with the help of the spare oxen wc crossed
  the river safely at the ford although it was
  very full and on the farther side were received
  by a guard of inept tall soldier-like fellows all
  of them armed with axe a the messengers
  had been they led us up to the cattle en-
  closure in the centre of the town which al-

	though it could be used to protect beasts in
  case of emergency also served the practical
  purpose of a public square

    here some ceremony was in progress for
  soldiers stood round the kraal while herald
  pranced and shouted at the head of the

place in front of the chiefs big hut was a litti
group of people among whom a big gaud
man sat upon a stool clad in a warriors dres
with a great and very long axe halted wit
wire-lashed rhinoceros horn laid across b
knees our guides led me with hans sne
ing after me like a dejected and low-bred do
for the wagon had stopped outside the gate
across the kraal to where the heralds shoute
and the big man sat yawning at once
noted that he was a very remarkable persoi
broad and tall and spare of frame with lon
tough-lookiug arms a fierce face which r
minded me of that of the late king dingaad
a great hole in his head above the temple whet
the skull had been driven in by some bio
and keen royal-looking eyes he looked up
and seeing me cried

   what  has a white man come to rigb
me for the chieftainship of the people of tfc
axe  well he is a small one

   no i answered quietly  but mac urn
zahn watcher by night has come to visit ya
in answer to vonr request o umslopogaas-
macumazahn whose name was known in ts
land before yours was told of o umslopogaa
the chief heard and rising from his sea
lifted the big axe in salute

   i greet you o macumazahn he sai

	who although you are small in stature at
very great indeed in fame have i not hear
how you conquered bangu although sadufc
slew him and of how you gave up the 
hundred head of cattle to tshoza and the m
of the amangwane who fought with you tl
cattle that were your own  have i nj
heard how you led the amawombe against th
csutu and stamped flat three of cetywayo
regiments in the days of panda although alas
because of an oath of mine i lifted no steel 
that battle i who will have nothing to 
with those who spring from the blood 
senzangacona perhaps because i snjcll 
strongly of it macumazahn oh  yes i hav
heard these and many other things concert
ing you though until now it has never
my fortune to look upon your face o watcfc
by night and therefore i greet you w
bold one cunning one upright one ricnd 
us black people	

   thank you i answered  but you s
something about fighting ii there is to 
anything of the sort let us get it over i  ff
want to fight i am quite ready and i tapf
the ntle which  earned

  the grira chief broke into a laugh and sa
 listen by an ancient law any man 
a certain day in each year may tight me
this chieftainship as i fought him who u
it before me and take it from me with t
life and the axe though of late none seem 
like the business but that law was ma
before there were guns cr men like macuitt
zahn who it is said can hit a grasshopper c
a wall at fifty paces therefore i tell y
that if you wish to fight me o macutnazah
f give in and you may have the chieftainship-
and he laughed again in his fierce fahion i
 i think it is too hot for lighting eith
rider haggard

with guns or axes and chieftainships are honey
at is full of stinging bees  answered

  then i took my seat on a stool that had
jen brought for me and placed by the side
 umslopocaas after which the ceremony
went on

  the heralds having cried out the challenge
wall and sundry to come and fight the holder
 the axe for the chieftainship of the axe
ithout the slightest result since nobody
seemed to desire to do anything of the sort
j-nislopogaas after a pause rose swinging
is formidable weapon round his head and
declared that by right of conquest he was
chief of the people for the ensuing year an
ooounccment that everybody accepted with-
out surprise

  after a pause he said

 why do you come to visit me macumi-
who have never done so before  

   i do not come to visit you umslopogaas
bat was not my intention you brought me
j rather the flooded rivers and you together
bought me for i was on my way to natnl
ami could not cross the drifts

yet i think you have a message for me
white man for not long ago a certain wander-
ln witch-doctor who came here told me to
fpect you and that you had words to say
me

   did he umslopogaas  well it is true
bat  have a message though it is one that 
id not mean to deliver

  yet being here perchance you will deliver
macumazahn for those who have message
od will not speak them sometimes cotne to

trouble

   yes being here i will deliver it seeing
at so it seems to be fated but on one con-
dition only that what the ears hear the heart
hall keep to itself alone 

  umslopogaas laid his hand upon the broad
lge of the weapon beside him and said
 by the axe i swear it if  break the
th be the axe my doom

  then i told him the tale as i have set it
-own already thinking to myself that of it he
uld understand little being but a wild
arrior-man a it chanced however i was
mistaken for he seemed to understand a great
ueal perchance because such primitive natures
e in closer touch with high and secret things
kan we imagine perchance for other reasons
ith which i became acquainted later

   well white man he said at length  now
ow am  to know that oil this is not but a
rap for my feet which already seem to feel
jrds between the toes of both of them 
hat token do you bring o watcher by
ight  how am i to know that the opener
j roads really em me this message which
k been delivered so strangely by one who
hd to travel on another path  

   i cant say i answered  at least in
words but i added after telret ion  aa
yon ask for a token perhaps  might bo able
jo show yon something that would bring proof

oyour heartif there were any secret place -

  t-mslopogaas walked to the gateway of the

fence and saw that the sentry was at his post
then he walked round the hut casting an eye
upon its roof and muttered to me as he re-
turned

   once i was caught thus there lived a
certain woman who set her oar to the smoke-
hole and so brought about the death of many
and among them of herself and of our children
enter all is safe yet if you talk speak
low

  so we went into the hut taking the stools
with us and seated ourselves by the fire tliat
burned there on to which umslopogaas threw
chips of resinous wood

    now he said

  i opened my shirt and by the bright light
of the flame showed hitn the image of zikali
which hung about my neck he stared at it
though touch it he would not then he stood
up and lifting his great axe he saluted the
image with the word  mttaosi   the salute
that is given to great wizards because they
arc supjoscd to be the home of many spirits

    it is the big medicine the medicine itself
he said  tliat which has been known in the
land since the time of seuzangacona the father
of the zulu royal house and as it is said be-
fore him

  he sat down again and was silent fur a long
time at last he spoke slowly

   you wish to consult a white witch-doc-
toress macumazahn who according to zikali
lives far to the north as to the dead now 
too though perchance you will not think it
of a black man desire to learn of the dead 
yes of a certain wife of my youth who was
sister and friend as well as wife whom too i
loved better than all the world  also of a
brother of mine whose name i do not speak
who ruled the wolves with me and who died
at my side on yonder witch-mountain having
made him a mat of men to lie on in a great
and glorious fight for of him as of the
woman i think all day and dream all night
nnd i would learn if they still live anywhere
and i may look to sec them again when  have
rlied as a warrior should and as i hope to do
do you understand watcher by night  

  i answered that  understood very well as
his case seemed to be like my own

  it may happen went on im-lopogaas
 that all this talk of the dead who are sup-
posed to live utter they are dead is but as the
sound of wind whispering in the reeds at
night that comes from nowhere and goes no-
where and means nothing but at least it
will be a great journey in which we shall find
adventure and nghtinc since it is well known
in the land that wherever macumazahn goes
there is a plenty of both also  think that
we shall agree well together though my temper
is rough at times and that neither of us will
desert the other in trouble though of that
little yellow dog of yours i am not so sure

   i answer for him  replied  me is a
true man and a cunning when once he is away
from drink 

  then we spoke of plans for our journey


hutchinsons story magazine

and of where we should meet to make it talk-
ing till it was late after which  went to
sleep in the guest hut

          chapter iv
the uox and the axe
next day early i left tho town of the people
of the axe having bid a formal farewell to
umslopogaas saying in a voice which all
could hear that as the rivers were still flooded
i proposed to ttek to the northern parts of
zululand and trade there until the weather
was better our private arrangement how-
ever was that on the night of the next full
moon which happened four weeks later we
should moot at the eastern foot of a certain
great flat-topped mountain known to both of
us which stands to the north of zululand but
well beyond its borders

  so northward i trekked slowly to spare my
oxen trading as i went the details do not
matter but as it happened i met with more
luck upon that journey than had come ray
way for many a long year although i worked
on credit since nearly all my goods were sold
as owing to my repute i could always do in
zululand i made some excellent bargains in
cattle and to top up with bought a large lot
of ivory so chcap that really i think it must
have been stolen all of this cattle and ivory
together i rent to natal in charge of a white
friend of mine whom i could trust where the
stuff was duly sold very well indeed and the
proceeds paid to my account the  trade 
equivalents being duly remitted to the native
vendora in fact my good fortune was such
that if  had been superstitious like hans i
should have been inclined to attribute it to-
tho influence of zikalis great medicine
as it wa i knew it to be one of the chances
of a traders life and accepted it with a shrug
as often i had been accustomed to do in the
alternative of losses

  in due course and without accident for the
weather which had been so wet had now
turned beautifully fine and dry we came to
the great flat-topped hill where umslopogaas
awl i had agreed to meet trekking thither
over high sparsely umbered veld that offered
few difficulties to the wagon this hill which
was known to such natives aa lived in those
parts by a long word that means  hut-with-
a-flat-roof is surrounded by forests for here
trees grow wonderfully well perhaps because of
the water that flows from its slopes forcing
our way through this forest which was full of
game i reached its eastern foot and there
camped five days before that night of full moon
on which i had arranged to meet unulopogas

  at some time or other there had been a native
village at this spot probably the zulus had
cleaned it out in long-past years for i found
human bones black with age lying in the lony
grass indeed the cattle kraal still remained
and in such good condition that by piling up
a fow stones here and there on the walk and
cloning the narrow entrance with thorn bushes

we could still use it to enclose our oxen at nigb
this i did for fear lest there should be licfl
about though  had neither seen nor heard an

  the days went by pleasantly enough wit
lots to eat since whenever we wanted meat
had only to go a few yards to shoot a fa buc
at a spot whither they trekked to dtink in th
evening

  the moon came up in silver glory and after
had taken a good look at her for luck also ati
the veld within sight i turned in an hoi
or two later some noise from the direction 
the cattle kraal woke me up as it did n
recur i thought that i would go to sleep nail
then an uneasy thought came to me that
could not remember having looked to 
whether the entrance was properly closed i
it was my habit to do it was the same sot
of troublesome doubt which in a civilised hons
makes one get out of bed and go up the
passages to the sitting-room to see whet
one has put out the lamp it always pro-
that one has put it out but that does not j
vent a repetition of the performance next t
the perplexity arises  reflected that per
the noise was caused by the oxen pushing f
way through the carelessly closed entra
and at any rate that i had better go to
so i slipped on ray boots and a coat and w
without waking hans or the boys only talri
with me a light single-barrelled rifle which
used for shooting small buck but no ir
cartridges

  now in front of the gateway of the catt
kraal shading it grew a single big tree of 
wild hg order passing under this tree i loo
and saw that the gateway was quite seeur
closed as now i remembered i had noted
sunset then i started to go back but 
not stepped more than two or three paces w-
in the bright moonlight i saw the head of m
smallest ox a beast of the zulu breed s
denly appear over the top of the wall a
this there would have been nothing part
larly astonishing had it not been for the f
that as i could tell from the closed eyes a
the hanging tongue this head belonged to
dead animal

   what in the name of goodness- i

gan to myself when my reflections were
short by tho appearance of another head t
of one of the biggest lions i ever saw w
had the ox by the throat and with the en
mous strength that is given to these creatu-
by getting its back beneath the body
deliberately hoisting it over the wall to
it away to devour at it leisure

  there was the brute within twelve feet
me and what is more it saw me as i saw i
and stopped still holtiug the ox by the thr

   what a chance for allan quatermain i
course he shot it dead i can latlcy any
saying who knows me by repute also that
the gift of god i am handy with a rifle

  well so it should have been fot even wi
the small-bore piece that i carried a
ought to have pierced through the soft
of the throat to the brain and killed that
hon os dead as julius cutr t


ea there ws a mod awful noie of roaring ana wncmni loana  sa
er i shall see again a tall grim black man was fighting the great lion
one paw but still stood upon its hind legs striking at him with th
hutchinsons story magazine

the thing was easy enough  indeed although
naturally i was startled for a moment by the
time that i had the rifle to my shoulder i had
little fear of the issue unless indeed there
was a miss-fire especially as the beast was so
astonished that it remained quite still

  then the unexpected happened as it gener-
ally does in life particularly in hunting which
in my case is a part of life i fired but by
misfortune the bullet struck the tip of the
horn of that confounded ox which tip either
was or at that moment fell in front of the spot
on the lions throat whereat half-unconsciously
i had aimed kesult the ball was turned
and departing at an angle just cut through
the skin of the lions neck deeply enough
to lmrt it very much and to make it madder
than all the hatters in the world

  dropping the ox with a most terrific roar
it came over the wall at me i remember that
there seemed to be yards of it-i mean of the
lion-in front of which there appeared a
cavern full of gleaming teeth

  i skipped back with much agility also
slightly to one side because there was nothing
else to do reflecting in a kind of inconsequent
way that zikalis great medicine was after
all not worth a curse the lion landed on my
side of the wall and reared itself upon its hind
legs before getting to business towering high
above me but a little to my left then i saw
a strange thing a shadow thrown by the
moon flitted past me-all i noted of it was tho
distorted shape of a great lifted axe probably
because the axe came first this shadow fell
and with it another shadow that of a lions
paw dropping to the ground then there was
a most awful noise of roaring and wheeling
round i saw such a fray as never i shall see
again a tall grim black man was lighting
the great lion that now lacked one paw but
still stood upon its hind legs striking at him
with the other

  the man who was absolutely silent dodged
the blow and hit back with tho axe catching
the beast upon the breast with such weight
that it came to the ground in a lopsided
fashion since it had only one paw on which
to light

  the axe flashed up again and before the
lion could recover itself or do anything else
fell with a crash upon its skull sinking deep
into the head after which all was over for the
beasts brain was cut in two

   i am here at the appointed time macu-
mazahn said umslopogaas for it was he as
with difficulty he dragged the axe from the
lions severed skull  to find you watching by
night as it is reported that you always do

   no i retorted for his tone irritated me

 you arc late bulalio the moon has been up
some hours

   i said o macumarahn that i would meet
you on tho night of the full moon not at the
riling of the moon

  that is true i replied mollified and
at any rate you came at u good moment

   yes he answered  though an it hap-
pens in this light the thing was easy to any-

one who can handle an axe had it be
darker the end might have been diilereo
but macumazahn you are not so clever as
thought since otherwise you would not hat
come out against a uon with a toy like that
and he pointed to the little rifle in my hand

   i did not know that there was a hoi
umslopogaas

   that is why you are not so clever as
thought since of one sort or another there
always a lion which wise men should be pr
pared to meet macumazahn

  then he turned and wliistled and beholt
out of the long grass that grew at a little di
tance emerged twelve great men all of thd
bearing axes and wearing cloaks of hyef
skins who saluted me by raising their axes

   set a watch and skin me this beast b
dawn it will make us a mat said umsl
pogaas whereon again they saluted silent
and melted away

   who arc these   i asked

   a few picked warriors whom i brougb
with me macumazahn there were one
tv-a more but they got lost on the way

  then we went to the wagon and spoke
more that night

  next morning we started on our journey

  now while he was preparing to draw-
map in the ashes or afterwards  forget wh
zikali bad told me that when we drew near w
the great river we should come to a place 
the edge of bush-veld that ran down to tm
river where a white man lived adding tbaj
he thought this white man was a  trek-boer

  this i should explain means a dutchrna
who lias travelled away from wherever he live
and made a home for himself in tho wilderne
as some wandering spirit and the desire to b
free of authority often prompts these people t
do also after an inspection of his enchant
knuckle bones he had declared that soffl
thing remarkable would happen to this mi
or his family while i was visiting him
in that map he drew in the ashes the
of which were so indelibly impressed upon
memory he had shown me where  should fi
the dwelling of this white man of whom
of whose habitation doubtless he knew t
the many spies who seem to be at the
vice of all witch-doctors and more es
of zikali the greatest among them

  travelling by the sun and the compam
had trekked steadily in the exact directio
tliat he indicated to find that in this useh
particular he was well named the  opener 
roads since always before me i found 
practicable path although to the right or tfc
left there was none thus when we came t
mountains it was at a spot where we di
covered a pass when we came to swa
it was where a ridge of high ground r
between them and so forth also such tnfc
as we met upon our journey always prove
of a friendly character although perhaps tfcf
aspect of xjmtlopogaas and his fierce ban-
whom rather irreverently i named the twel
apostles iiad some share in inducing th
peaceful attitude


  so smooth was our progress and to well

        water t certain intervals that at
 t i came to the conclusion that we must bo
 allowing some ancient road which at a for-
 gotten period of history had run from south
  north or vice versa or rather to be
 it was the observant hans who made
  discovery from various indications which
 rf escaped my notice i need not stop to
  vil them but one of these was that at ccr-
 places the watcr-holos on high rather
 n land had been dug out and in one or
 instances lined with stones after the
 jjjn of an ancient well evidently ve were
 jing some old trade route made perhaps
 jwgotten ages when africa was more c ivilised
  it is now

   for seven days we trekked till at length
 e saw far away a vast sea of bush-veld which
 y  guessed correctly must fringe the great
 uibcsi river moreover we or rather hans

   -v eyes were those of a hawk saw some-
 ng else -namely buildings of a more or
 j civilised kind which stood among trees
 v the side of a stteam a mile or two on this
 de of the great belt of bush

 look baas said han  those wanderers
 pd not lie  there is the house of the white
 i wonder if he drinks anything stronger
 jan water he added with a sigh and a kind
 reminiscent contraction of his yellow throat

chapter v

ink

  had sighted the house from far away
 yrtly after sunrise and by midday we were
 as wc approached it i saw that it
 almost immediately beneath two great
 obab trees-banyan trees wc call them in
 jjpoth africa perhaps because monkeys eat
 rir fruit it was a thatched house with
 itewaihed walls and a slaep or veranda
 und it apparently of the ordinary dutch
 vpe moreover beyond it at a little distance
 sre other houses or rather shanties with
 gon sheds etc and mixed up with these a
 nber of native huts farther on wore con-
 jjerable held with springing corn  ho we
 s herds of cattle grazing -o the slopes
 -vidently our white man was rich
 umslopogaas surveyed the place with a sol-
 ars eye and said to me

  this roust be a peaceful country macu-
 epxalm where no attack is feared since of
 fences i see none 

 l yes  answered  why not with a wil-
 gess behind it and bush-veld and a great
 in front

 i  men can cross rivers and travel through
 th-veld he answered and was silent

 -p to this time we had seen no one al-
 fough it might have been presumed that a
 on trekking towards the house was a sofii-
 jptttty unusual sight to have attracted atten

    where can they be   i asked
 i asleep baas i think said hans and as
   matter of fact he wan right the whole

rider haggard

population of the place was indulging in a
noonday siesta

   at last we got so near to the house that i
halted the wagon and descended from the
driving-box in order to investigate at this
moment some one did appear the sight of
whom astonished me not a little-namely a
very striking-looking young woman she was
tall handsome with large dark eyes good
features a rather pale complexion and  think
the saddest face that  ever saw evidently
she liad beard the noise of the wagon and had
come out to see what it was for she had no-
thing on her head which was covered with thick
hair of a raven blackness catching sight aji
the great umslopogaas with his gleaming axe
and of his savage-looking bodyguard she
uttered an exclamation and not unnaturally
turned to fly

    its all right  sang out emerging from
behind the oxen and in english though before
the words had lptt my lips i reflected that
there was not the slightest reason to suppose
that she would understand them probably
she was dutch or portuguese although by
some instinct t had addressed her in english

   to my surprise she answered me in the same
tongue spoken it is true with a peculiar
accent which  could not plncc as it was neither
scotch nor irish

    thank you she said  i sir was fright-
ened your friends look- here she

stumbled for a word then added  terrocious

   i laughed at this composite adjective and
ansurred

    well so they are in a way though they
will not harm you or me but young lady
tell me can we outspan here  perhaps your

husband-

    i have no husband  i have only a father
sir and she sighed

    well then could i speak to your father 
my name is allan quatcrmain and i am mak-
ing a journey of exploration to find out about
the country beyond you know

    yes  will go and walte him he is asleep
every one sleeps here at midday-except me 
she said with another sigh

    why do you not follow their example  
 asked jocosely for this young woman puzzled
me and  wanted to find out about her

    because i sleep little sir who think too
much there will be plenty of lime to sleep
soon for all of us will there not  

    stared at her and then inquired her name
because i did not know what civ to say

    my name is inez robertson she answered
  will go to wake my father meanwhile
please unyoke your oxen they can food
with the others  they look as though they
want rest poor things she added and went
into the house

   iner robertson i thought to mvself
 thats a queer combination english father
and portuguese mother  suppose but what
can an englishman be doing in a place like
this if it had been a trek-boer i should
not have been surprised  then i began to
give directions about out-panning


hutchinsons story magazine

  we had just got the oxen out of tbe yokes
when a big raw-boned red-bearded blue-eyed
roughly-clad man of about fifty years of agi-
appeared from the house yawning i threw
my eye over him as he advanced with a peculiar
rolling gait and formed certain conclusions

a drunkard who has once been a gentleman 
reflected to myself for thcro was something
particularly dissolute in his appearance also one
who has had to do with the sea  a diagnosis
which proved very accurate

   how do you do mr allan quatermain -
which i think my daughter said is your name
unless i dreamed it for it is one that  seem
to have hoard before he exclaimed with a
broad scotch accent which i do not attempt
to reproduce  what in the name of blazes
brings you here where no real white man has
been for years  well i am glad enough to
see you anyway for i am sick of half-breed
portuguese and niggers anil snuff-and-buttcr
girls and gin and bad whisky leave your
people to attend to those oxen and come in
and have a drink

   thank you mr robertson-

  captain robertson he interrupted

 man dont look astonished yon mightnt
guess it but x commanded a mail steamer
once and should like to hear myself called
rightly again before i die

  he led the way into the sitting-room-there
was but one in the house it proved a queer
kind of place with rude furniture seated with
strips of hide after the boer fashion and yet
bearing a certain air of refinement which-was
doubtless due to inez who with the assistance
of a native girl was already engaged in setting
the table thus there was a shell with books
shakespeare was one of these i noticed over
which nung an ivory crucifix suggesting that
inez was a catholic on the walla too were
two good portraits and on the window-ledge
a jar full of flowers also the forks and spoons
were of silver as were the mugs and engraved
with a tremendous coat-of-arms and a portu-
guese motto

  presently the food appeared which was ex-
cellent and plentiful and the captain his
daughter and i sat down and ate also i
noted that he drank gin and water an innocent-
looking beverage but strong as he took it it
was ofcered to mo but like miss inez i preferred
coffee

  during the meal and afterwards while wo
smoked upou the veranda i told them as
much as i thought desirable of my plans i
said that i was engaged on a journey of ex-
ploration of the country beyond the zambesi
and that having heard of this settlement which
by tho way was called strathrnuir as i
gathered after a place in far-away scotland
where the captain had been born and pissed
his childhood i had come here to inquire as
to how to cross the great river and about
other things the captain was interested
especially when i informed him that i was that
same  hontcr quatermain  of whom he had
heard in past year but told me that it would
be impossible to take the wagon down into the



low bush-veld which we could see on tl
horizon as there all the oxen would die of ti
bite of the tsetse fly i answered that i w
aware of this and proposed to try to make a
arrangement to leave it in his charge till
returned

    that might be managed mr quatermain
he answered  but man will you ever rfr
turn  they say there are queer folk livio
on the other side of the zambesi savage m
who arc cannibals-araahagger i think the
call them it was they who in past yeax
cleaned out all this country except a few riv
tribes who live in floating huts or on island
among the reeds and thats why it is so ompt
but this happened long ago much before to
time and i dont suppose they will ever croa
the river again

    if i might ask what brought yon heri
captain   i said for the point was one o
which i felt curious

   that which brings most men to wit
places mr quatermain-trouble if you waj
to know i had a misfortune and piled up
ship some lives were lost and rightly
wrongly i got the sack then i started
a trader in a god-forsaken hole named c
one of the zambesi mouths you know
did very well as we scotchmen have a way
doing there i married a portuguese lady
real lady of high blood one of the old
when my girl inez was about twelve y
old i got into more trouble for my wife di
and it pleased a certain relative of her to
that it was because i had neglected her 
ended in a row and the truth is that i kill
him-in fair fight mind you still kill him
did though i scarcely knew that  had d
it at the time after which the place grew t
hot to hold me so i sold up and a
that i would have no more to do with w
they choose to call civilisation on the
coast during my trading i had heard t
there was fine country up this way and h
i came and settled years ago bringing
girl and thomaso who was one of my ma
gers also a few other people with me
here i have been ever iince doing very
as before for i trade a lot in ivory and
things and grow stuff and cattle which i
to the river natives yes i am a rich
now and could go and live on my mea
scotland or anywhere

   why dont von   i asked  it wou
surely be betterfor miss inez  

    ah   he ald with a quiver in his voictt
 there you touch it she ought to go aw a
there is no one for her to marry here wf
we havent seen a white man for years
shes a lady right enough like her -

but who is she to go to  moreover she
me in her own fashion as i love her and
wouldnt leave me because she thinks it h
duty to stay and knows that if she did i
go to the devil altogether still perhaps
might help me about her mr quater
that is if you live to come back from
journey he added doubtfully

   i felt inclined to ask how i could possibv
rider haggard

 jep in such a matter but thought it wisest
 ay nothing this however he did not
 notice for he went on

 u now i think i will have a nap for i do
 jfcy work in the early morning andsometimes
 me at night when my brain seems to clear up
 gain for you sec i was a sailor for many years
 fnd accustomed to keeping watches youll
 took after yourself won t you and treat the
 pcf as your own   then he vanished into
 e house to he down

    when i had finished my pipe i went for a
 alk first i visited the wagon where i
 ound umslopogaas and his company engaged
 j cooking the beast that had been given
 tbem zulu fashion liana with his usual
  jnning had already secured a meal prob-
 oy from the servants or from inei herself
  least he left them and followed me first
 e went down to the huts where we saw a
 jomber of good-looking women of mixed
 wood all decently dressed and engaged about
 eir household duties also we saw four or
 jive boys and girl to say nothing of a baby
  arms fine young people one or two of
 hain were more white than coloured

    these children arc very like the baas with
 oe red beard remarked hans reflectively

   yes i said and shivered for nowi under-

 ho tied him to this spot as anchors tie a ship i

chapter vi
the ska-eow ncjrr

 r had been my intention to push forward
 fosi the river at once but here luck ur
 old inend fate wa against me to
 pn with several of umslopogaas men fell
 jjtk with a kind of stomach trouble arising no
 jkubt from something they had eaten and
 ere were many preparations to be made
 out the toads and so forth since the wagon
 ust be left behind also and this was an-
 i jhrr complication hans had a sore upon his
 ot resulting from the prick of a poisonous
 fcorn and it was desirable that this should be
 wtc healed before we marched

 -so it came about that i was really glad when
 j jptain robertson suggested that we should
 pdown to a certain swamp formed i gathered
 some small tributary of the zambesi to
 part in a kind of hippopotamus battue

  i ml in with the idea readily enough unce
 j all my hunting life i had never seen any-
  k oi the ort- epecij as i was told that
 expedition could not take more than a
 eek and i reckoned that the sick men and
 jans would not be tit to travel sooner so
 pat preparations were made th riverside
 groves whose saare of tho spoil was to be the
 jciv of the slain sea cows were summoned
 st hundreds and sent off to thetr appointed
 tvrs to beat the swamps at a signal given
  the firing of a great pile of reeds also
 y other things were done upon which i
 w not enter
 then came the time for us to depart to the

appointed spot about twenty miles away
most of which distance it se--med we could
trek in the wagon captain robertson who
for the time had cut oil his gin was as active
about the atiair as though he were once more
in command of a mail steamer nothing es-
caped his attention  indeed in the care which
he gave to details he reminded me of the cap-
tain of a great ship that was leaving port
and from it i learned how able a man he must
once have been

   does your daughter accompany us   i
asked on the night before we started

   oh i no he answered  she would only
bo in the way she will be quite safe here
especially as thomaso who is no hunter re-
mains in charge ol the place with s few of the
older natives to look after the women and
children

  later i saw inez herself who said that she
would have liked to come although she hated
to see great beasts killed but that her father
was against it because he thought she might
catch fever so she supposed that she had
better remain where she was

   agreed though in my heart i was doubt-
ful and said that  was leaving hans whose
foot was not as yet quite well and with whom
she had made friends as she had done with
umslopogaas to look after her also there
would be with him the two great zulus who
were now recovering from their attack of
stomach sickness so tliat she had nothing to
fear she answered with her slow smile that
she feared nothing still she should have liked
to come with us then we parted as it
proved for a long time

  it was quite a ceremony umslopogaas
 in the name of the axe solemnly gave over
inei to the charge of his two followers bidding
them guard her with so much earnestness that
 began to suspect he feared something which
he did not choose to mention i also gave
hans instructions to keep a sharp eye on inex
and generally to watch the place and ii he
saw anything suspicious to communicate with
us at once

    yes baas said hans  i will look after

	sad eyes  -for so with their usual quickness
of observation our zulus had named inex-
 as though she were my grandmother though
what there is to fear for her  do not know
but baas i would much rather come and
look after you as your reverend father the
predikant told me to do always which is my
duty not girl-hording baas also my foot is
now quite well and-i want to shoot sea-cows
and-

   you will stop here hans look after the
young lady and nurse your foot i said
sternly whereon he collapsed with a ugh and
asked for some tobacco

  so ofl we went about twenty of the village
natives a motley crew armed with every kind
of gun marching ahead and tinging songs
then came the wagon with captain robert-
son and myself seated on the driving-lox and
lastly umslopogaas and his zulus except the
two who had been left behind


hutchinsons story magazine

  before nightfall wc came to a ridge where
this bush-veld turned south fringing that
tributary of the great river in the swamps of
which we were to hunt for sea-cows here we
camped and next morning leaving the wagon
in charge of my voorlooper and a couple of
the strathmuir natives for the driver was to
act as my gun-bearer we marched down into
the sea of bush-veld it proved to be full of
game but at this wc dared not fire for fear of
disturbing the hippopotami in the swamps
beneath whence in that event they might
escape is back to the river

  about midday we passed out of the bush-
veld and reached the place where the drive
was to be here bordered by steep banks
covered with bush was a swamp not more
than three hundred yards wide down the ccntrc
of which ran a narrow channel of rather deep
water draining a vast expanse of morass above
it was up this channel that the sea-cows
travelled to tho feeding-ground where they
loved to collect at this season of the year

  here with the assistance of some of the river-
side natives - the rest to the number of several
hundreds had made a wide detour to the head
of the swamps miles away whence we were
to advance at a certain signal-we made our
preparations under the direction of captain
robertson these were simple a quantity
of thorn-trees were cut down and by means of
heavy stones tied to their trunks anchored in
the narrow channel of deep water while to
their tops which floated on the placid surfacc
were tied a variety of rags which we had
brought with us such as old red flannel shirts
gay-coloured but worn-out blankots and i
know not what besides some of these frag-
ments too were attached to the anchored
ropes under water also we selected places
for the guns upon the steep banks that i have
mentioned between which this channel ran
foreseeing what would happen i chose one for
myself behind a particularly sound rock and
what is more built a stone wall to the height
of several feet on the landward side of it as
i guessod that the natives posted abovo me
would prove wild in their shooting

  these labours occupied the rest of that day
and at night we retired to higher ground to
sleep before dawn on the following morning
we returned and took up our stations some
on one side of the channel and some on the
other which wc had to reach in a canoe bought
for the purpose from the river natives

  then before the sun rose captain robert-
son fired a huge pile of dried reeds and bushes
which was to give tho signal to the river
natives far away to begin their beat thin
done we sat down and waited after making
sure that every gun had plenty of ammunition
ready

  as the dawn broko by climbing a tree near
tny sckame or shelter i saw a good many mil
away to the south a wide circle of little fires
and guessed that the native were beginning
to burn the dry reeds of the swamp in response
to our signals presently these fire drew
together into a thin wall of flame then i

knew that it was time to return to the scju-
and prepare it was full daylight however
before anything happened

  watching the still channel of water i m
ripples on it and bubbles of air rising sud-
denly appeared the head of a great bulhj
hippopotamus which having caught sight of
our barricade cither above or below water
had risen to the surface to see what it might
be i put a bullet from an eight-bore riilflj
through its brain whereon it sank as i guessed
stone dead to the bottom of the channel thu
helping to increase the barricade by the buufj
of its great body also it had another etlect-
i have observed that sea-cows cannot bear thel
smell and taint of blood which frightens therul
horribly so that they will expose themselveq
to almost any risk rather than get it into their
nostrils now in this still water where therl
was no perceptible current the blood from the
dead bull soon spread all about so that whraj
the herd began to arrive following their leader
they were terribly frightened indeed tlitf
first of them on winding or tasting it tunndl
and tried to get back up the channel where
however they met others following and there-
ensued a tremendous confusion they ru-al
to the surface blowing snorting bellowing
and scrambling over each other in the waterj
while continually more and more arrived bc-l
hind them till there was a perfect pandemoniuo
in that narrow place

  all our guns opened fire wildly upon thel
mass it was like a battle and through the
smoke i caught sight of the riverside natives
who were acting as beaters advancing fal
away fantastically dressed screaming with
excitement and waving spears or sometime
torches of laming reeds most of these tnes
were scrambling along the banks but some of
the bolder spirits advanced over the lagoon if
canoes driving the hippopotami towards til
mouth of the channel by which alone the
could escape into the great swamps below an
so on to the river in all my hunting experi-
ence i do not think i ever saw a more remark-
able scene still in a way to me it was un-
pleasant for i flatter myself that i am 
sportsman and a battue of this sort is not
sport as i understand the term

  at length it came to this  the channel fcf
quite a long way was literally full ol hippo
potami-i should think thete must have be
a hundred of them or more of all sorts an
sixes from great bulls down to little calvr
some of these were killed not many for tfc
shooting of our gallant company was execrabk
and almost at hazard though for every
cow that died of which number i thin th
captain robertson and myself accounted
most many were only wounded

  still the unhappy beasts crazed with
and fire and blood did not seem to dare
face our frail barricade probably for tw
reason that i have given for a while the
remained massed together in the water
under it making a most homble noise th
of a sudden they seemed to take a reolutio j
a few of them broke back towards the buri

reds the screaming beaters and the

jng canoes one of these indeed a

 jjonoded bull charged a canoe crushed it in
 u huge jaws and killed the rower how exactly
 ido not know or his body was never found
 le majority of them however took another
 ttnsel for emerging from the water on either
 u they began to scramble towards us along
  steep banks or even to climb up them with
 urpn sing agility it was at thi point in the
 proceedings that t congratulated myself

 the
 as a

  ywcitly upon the solid character of
  swer-worn rock which i had selected

stater

 behind

tiiis rock together with my gun-

 kftirer and umslopogaas who as he did not
 aoot had elected to be

                        my companion i
 trrtiched and banged away at the unwieldy
 features as they advanced but fire fast as

 	olight with two rifles i could not stop the
 alf of them and they were drawing nnplea-
 nuy near i glanced at umslopogaas and
 en then was amosed to see that probably
 or the first time in his life that redoubtable
 iv-arrior was in a genuine fright

    thisis madness macumazahn he shouted
    e the din  are we to stop here and be
    ped flat by a horde of water-pigs  

 it seems so i answered  unless you pre-
 to be stamped flat outside or eaten i
 tided pointing to a great crocodile that had
 emerged irom the channel and was coming
 ion towards us with open jaws

   by the axe shouted umslopogaas
 n   will not die thus trodden on like a
 jug by on ox 

 now i have mentioned a tre which i
 bed in his extremity umslopogaas
 for that tree and went up it like a lamp-
 ter just as the crocodile wriggled past its
 ink snapping at his retreating legs after
 i took no more note of him partly because
 the advancing sea-cows and more for the
 that one  the village native posted
 ovc me firing wildly put a large round
 wlet through the sleeve of my coat indeed
 it not been for the wall which  built that
 ted ns  am certain that both my
  and i would have been killed for after-
  i found it splashed over with lead from
 uet which had struck the stones
 ell thanks to the strength of my rock and

 t-us great medicinc we escaped unhurt
 je ruah went by me  indeed i killed one
 jgj-cow so tktte that the powder i rum the
 actually burned its hide but it did gn
 g leaving us untouched all however were
 jr o fortunate since of the village natives
 were trampled to death while a third had

imi	a lan  t uia	rat 

 broken also
 bewildered

 and

 bull

 this was really
 charging at full

 crashed into the trunk of umslopogaas
 -- and as it wa not very- thick snapped it

 iown came the top in which the
 ifie-j chf was ensconced like a bird in a
 thtuh at that moment there was precious
 dignity about him however except
 eratchs he was not hurt as the hippopo

 tamus had ollvr business in urgent need of
 attention and did not stop to settle with him

   such are the things which happen to a
man who mixes himself up with matters of
which ho knows nothing said umslopogaas
scntentiously to me afterwards but all the
same he could never bear any allusion to this
ttee-climbing episode in his martial career
which as it happened had taken place in full
view of his retainers among whom it remained
the greatest of jokes indeed he wanted to
kill a man the wag of the party who gave him
a slang name which being translated means

 he-who-ii-so-brave-that-he-dared-to-ridt-a-
u-atar-horsc-up-a-lree

   it was all over at last for which i thanked
providence devoutly a good many of the
sea-cows were dead i think twenty-one was
our cxact bag but the great majority of them
had escaped in one way or another many as 
fear wounded i imagine that at the last the
bulk of the herd overcame its fears and swim-
ming through our screen passed away down
the channel at any rate they were gone and
having ascertained that there wi nothing to
be done lor the man who had been trampled
on my side of the channel i crossed it in the
canoe with the object of returning quietly to
our camp to rest

   but as yet there was to be no quiet for inc
for there i found captain robertson who 
think had been refreshing himself out of a
bottle and was in a great state of excitement
about a man who had been killed near him
who wai a favourite of his and another whose
leg was broken he declared vehemently
that the hippopotamus that had done this had
been wounded and rushed into some bushes a
few hundred yards away and that he meant
to take vengeance upon it indeed he was
just setting oil to do so

   seeing his agitated state  thought it wisest
to follow him what happened need not be
set out in detail- it is suthcient to sav that
he found that hippopotamus and blax-d both
barrels at it in the bushe hitting it but not
seriously out lumbered the creature with
its mouth open wishing to escape robert-
son turned to fly as he was in its path but
from one cause or another tripped and fell
down certainly he would have been crushed
beneath its huge feet had i uot stepped in
front of him and sent two solid eight bore bullets
down that yawning throat killing it dead
within three feet of where robertson was try-
ing to rise and i may add of myself

this narrow escape sobered him and i am
bound to say that his gratitude was profuftc

    you are a brave man he said  and had
it not been lor you by now  should be wher-
ever bad people go ill not forget it mr
quatermain and if ever you want anything that
john robertson can give why its yours

   very well i answered being voxed by
an inspiration  i do want something that
you can give easily enough

   give it a name and if yours-hall tny
place if you like

 i want i went on as  slipped new car-


hutchinsons story magazine

tridges into the rifle- i want you to promise
to give up drink for your daughters soke
thats what nearly did for you just now you
know

   man you ask a hard thin he said slowly
 but by god ill try i or her sake and yours
too

  then  went to help to set the leg of the in-
jured man which was all tho rest i got that
morning

chapter vii
the oath

we spent three more days at that place
first it was necessary to allow time to elapse
before the gases which generated in their great
bodies caused those of the sea-cows which had
been killed in the water to float then they
must be skinned and their thick hides cat into
strips and pieces to be traded for sjamboks
or to make small native shields for which some
of the east coast tribes will pay heavily all
this took a long while during which i amused
or disgusted myself in watching those river
natives devouring the flesh of the beasts the
lean what there was of it they dned and smoked
into a kind of  biltong but a great deal of
the fat they ate at once i had the curiosity
to woigli a lump which was given to one thin
hungry-looking fellow it scaled quite twenty-
fivo pounds within four hours he had eaten
it to the last ounce and lay there a distended
and torpid log what would not we white
people give for such a digestion 

  at last all was over and we started home-
wards the man with a broken leg being carried
in a kind of litter on the edge of the busli-
veld we found the wagon quite safe also one
of captain robertsons that had followed us
from strathmuir in order to carry the ex-

rcusd load of hippopotamus bides and ivory

asked my voorlooper if anything had hap-
pened during our absence he answered no-
thing but that on the previous ovening after
dark be had seen a glow in the direction of
strathmuir which lay on somewhat lower
ground about twenty miles away as though
numerous fires had been lighted there it
struck him so much ho added that he had
climbed it tree to observe it better ho did
not think however that any building had
been burned then- as the glow was uot strong
enough for that

  i suggested that it was caused by some grass
fire or reed-burning to which he replied in-
differently that he did not think so as the line
of glow was not sufliciantly continuous

  there tho matter ended though i confess
that tho story made mo anxioa for what exact
reason i conld not say c msl-jpogaas also
who had listened to it for tho talk was in zulu
looked grave but made no remark but as
since his tree climbing experience he had been
singularly silent of this i thought little

  we had trekkad at a time which we calcu-
lated would bring uj to strathmuir about an
hour before sundown allowing for a short
outspan half-way as my oxen were got in

more quickly than those of the other vvagi
after this outspan i was the first away i
lowed at a little distance by umslopogaas w
preferred to walk with his zulus  he tru
was that  could not get that story about th
glow of fires out of my mind and was anxi
to push on wliich had caused me to hurry 
the inspanning

  perhaps we jiad covered a couple of mil
of the ten or twelve wliich lay between us a
strathmuir when far ort on tbc crest of
of the waves of the veld which much resemble
those of a swelling sea frozen while in moti
i saw a small figure approaching us at a ra
trot somehow that figure suggested h
to my mind so much so that i got my glas
to examine it more closely a short scru
through them convinced me lhat hans it w
hans and no other advancing at a great-pa
filled with uneasiness i ordered the dti
to flog up the oxen with the result that i
little over five minutes we met halting
wagon i leapt from the wagon-box andca
to umslopogaas who had kept up with a
a slow swinging trot went to hans
when he saw me stood still at a little dist
swinging his apology for a hat in tus hand
was his fashion when ashamed or perplex
 what is the matter hans   i asked
when we were within speaking distance

   oh  baa everything he an-swered a
i noticed that he kept his eyes fixed upon th
ground and that his lips twitched

    speak you fool and in zulu i said f
by now umslopogaas had joined me

   baas lie aaswered in that tongue i
terrible thing has come about at the farm 
ked-beard yonder yesterday aftrm-on 
the time when people are in the liabit of lef
ing there till the sun grows less hot a body
great men with licrce faces who carried
spears-perhaps there were fifty of them b
-crept up to the place through tho long gr
and growing crops and attacked it

   did you see them come   i aked
 no baas i was watching at a little d
tance ai you bade me do and the sun bei
hot i shut my eyes to keep out the glare of
so that i did not see them until they
passed me and heard the noise

   you mean that you were aucep or dr
hans but go on	

   baas i do not know he answered shadj
fcedly  but after that i climbed a tall
with a kind of bush at the top of it  i a
tained afterwards that this was a sort of 
crowned palm  and from it i saw every
without being seen

   what did you sec hans   i asked bit
 i saw the big men run up and make a v
of circle round the village then they sh
and the people in tho village came out to

their backs protected by the stoep and killed
six of them before they themselves were killed
also sad-eyes shot one with a pistol she
carried and wounded another so that the spear
dropped out of his hand  hen the rest fcl on
her and tied her up setting her in a chair on the
steep where two remained to watch her they
did her no hurt baas indeed they seemed
to treat her as gently as they could also
they went into the house and there they caught
that tall yellow girl who always smiles and is
tailed janee she who waits upon the lady
sad-eyes and brought her out to her i
think they told her baas that she must look
after her mistress and that if she tried to run
away she would be killed for afterwards i saw
janee bring her food and other things

    and then hans  

    then baas most of the great men rested
a while though some of them went through
the store gathering such things as they liked
blankets knives and iron cooking-pots but
they set fire to nothing nor did they try to
catch the cattle also they took dry wood
from the pile and lit big fires eight ornine of
them and when the sun set they began to feast 

    what did they feast on hans if they took
no cattle   i asked with a shiver for i was
afraid of i knew not what

   baas answered hans turning his head
away and looking at the ground  they feasted
on the children whom they had killed also on
some of the young women these tall soldiers
are men-eaters baas

   at this horrible intelligence i turned faint
and felt as though i was going to fall but re-
covering myself signed to him to go on with
his story

    they feasted quite quietly baas he con-
tinued  making no noise then some of
them slept while others watched and that
went on all night as soon as it was dark
but before the moon rose i slid down the
tree and crept round to the back of the house
without being seen or heard as  can baas
i got into the house by the back door and
crawled to the window of the sitting-room it
was open and peeping through  saw sad-
i-yes still tied to the seat on the sloep not

                  away- whil the sirl fanee
crouched on the floor at her feet-i think she
was asleep or fainting

hilraadctaliltle noisc likc a sht-adder
sad fvau	on nakin it till at last

a v    hcr llcad thcn i spoke in
wilsprfor car lt i should wake
the two guards who were dozing on either side

of her wrapped in their blankets savin

	it is i hans come to help you  you

      elm nnwrpfl also

not she answered also speaking very s
get to your master and tell him and i
father to follow these men are calfcri
amahaggcr and live far away across the pv
they are going to take me to their home ai
i understand to rule over them because the
want a white woman to be their qucca s
have always beeu ruled by a white queen
against whom they have rebelled i do my
think they mean to do me any harm unlesr
perhaps they want to marry me to their chief
but of this i am not sure from their talk which
i understand badly now go before they
catch you

  i think you might get away i whispered
back  i will cut your bonds when you
arc free slip through the window and i will
guide you

     very well try it she said
 so i drew my knife and stretched out my
arm but thcn baas  showed myself a fool

-	if the great medicine had still been there 
should have knowu better i forgot the
moonlight which shone upon the blade of the
knife that girl janee came out of her sleep
or swoon lifted her head and saw the knife
she screamed once thcn at a word from hcr
mistress was silent but it was enough for
it woke up the guards who glared about then
and threatened janee with their great spears
also they went to sleep no more but began to
talk together though what they said i could
not hear for i was hiding on the floor of the
room after this knowing that i could do no
good and might do harm and get myself killed
 crept out of the house as i had crept in and
got back to my tree

   why did you not come to me   i asked
 because  still hoped i might be able to
help sad-eyes baas also i wanted to see
what happened and i knew that i could not
bring you here in time to be any good though
it is true i thought of coming

   perhaps you were right

   at the first dawn continued hans  the
great men who are called amahagger rose and
ate what was left over from the night before
 hen they gathered themselves together and
went to the house here they found a large
chair that seated with rimpis in which the
baas red-beard sits and lashed two poles to
the chair beneath the chair they tied the
garments and other things of the lady sad-
eyes which they made janee gather as a
lives directed her this done very gently
they sat sad-eyes herself in the chair bowing
while they made her fast after this eight oj
them set the poles upon their shoulders and
they all went away at a trot heading for the
bush-veld driving a herd of goats which they
had stolen from the farm and making jsnee
run by the chair i saw everything baas fo
they passed just beneath my tree then
came to seek you following the outward spo

    but-fffnti it were folly to throw away ones life  he who ruard the oriorer is salim tho fiercest

and -ronsceit of all tho-uard--

i dont care if shaitan himself guards tho prisoner im going to bcl him out o that hell-wmchow i

  so you played cain to your brother
abel eh achmed  well murder
seems to sit pretty lightly on your
soul you brown rascal 

  the man addressed who squatted cross-
legged on the sand outside the tent
grinned cheerfully and answered the in-
dictment with an insouciance which was
out of keeping with its gravity

    my brother he one big size villain
effendi he steal my money he steal my
land he take my wife so i kill him
but i take care the village think he die by
accident and now he sorry for his
wickedness no  

   cant say achmed depends on what
particular hell or heaven hes got to but
tell me did the act of killing give you
satisfaction  you got your land back 
and your wife  

  over the rascally brown face there fell
on the instant a veil of reserve the reserve
in which an arab wraps himself at mention
of his womonkind and amory regretting

his indiscretion made haste to change the
subject

   by the way didnt f see the runner
here to-night  letters for me i sup-
pose  

 immediately the brown face shed its
unaccustomed reticence and became a
chuckling mask once more

 letters-aiwa eltendi-many letters
for mistaire hamory heiquirc  

   well where are they  look sharp
you brown image or  shall have to liven
your wits with my riding whip i 

 quite unmoved by the threat achmed
produced a bundle of letters from some
mysterious hiding-place in his voluminous
robe and handed them gaily to his master

  here they be eflendi is it the
effendis pleasure that  now take my
evening meal  

  amorys eyes were on his letters

  yes clear out and leave me in
peace

   a iwa effendi achmed sprang agilciy
hutchinsons story magazine

to liis feet  there is much talk in the
village to-night one has just come in
from yonder-he waved vaguely over
the desert- with a tale of strange doings
in the harim of moussa bey 

  ambry paid no heed to the tentative
remark and with a shrug of the shoulders
achmed departed serenely in quest of the
cous-cous and the gossip which awaited
him ia the huddle of mud huts known as
the village of el-khatuin

  evening was falling genlly over the
desert the sky was softly afire with pale
green and paler violet hues in the midst
of which the round ball of gold which was
the sun trod delicately his steps veiled in
a mist of tender floating cloud a little
breeze wandered fitfully over the face of
the desert whispering faint promises of the
joys of the starlit night to come and in-
deed above the sandhills in the east one
silver star already trembled in the pale
firmament

  amorys white tent looked strange
almost eerie in the silent space which sur-
rounded it true the mud village was
only a quarter of a mile away and to the
north looking in the clear desert light but
a stones throw distant stood the great
villa of the powerful moussa bey the
mansion of delight to which the owner was
wont to resort when the cares of business
had pressed too closely upon his shoulders
yet the little white tent seemed a symbol of
some strange solitude a challenge flung
in the face of that civilisation which insists
that man shall herd with his fellow men
shall build houses and streets of houses
and avoid as it were a plague the wide
and open spaces of the earth

  and the little lent spoke truly  for in it
there dwelt a soul in rebellion in revolt
against the treachery of man the weakness
of woman against the double betrayal
which had driven a trusting fool into the
wilderness in a vain attempt to forget his
too confident folly

  yet as he bent over his letters to-night
christopher amorys face was not alto-
gether hard it was as though in the slow
atrophy of his affections one small area
were left untouched as though in a heart
devastated by the great fires of hatred and
contempt and lust for vengeance there yet
dwelt some softer emotion some tiny
flicker of that warm humanity which hail
been well-nigh extirpated by a ruthless
hand

  such at least would have boen the
conclusion of a psychologist watching him
to-night and the diagnosis would have

been correct for in his hand amory he
a letter from the one person in the worl
for whom he knew a real and very powerf
affection-his brother ivor

  he read the letter eagerly until he
to the hated name of his supplantcr  and
then his face changed from a half-wistf
protectiveness to a rancour which was not i
assumed

   they say - the doctors-that
joans chest is weak and so dorrien is j
taking her out to kgvpt some people
have all the luck-ive had a cold all the
winter but no one thinks of taking me out
there  thought id warn yoii in case
you ran against them in one of your visit
to cairo i know of course they treated
you abominably but still-i suppose the
couldnt help it could they  it would
have been worse if she had married yoi
and then bolted with him-and hes realh
quite a decent chap when you know him

  with an impatient exclamation amory
crushed the letter in his hand the peace i
of the desert had been rudely disturbed by
this chattering echo of a sordid tragedy
and he would read no farther yet aft
a moment he felt remorse for the way
had treated the letter of the brother
loved  and he smoothed out the crura
sheet and read it grimly to the end

  at the bottom of the last sheet came
scribbled postscript

   since writing the above somethin
rather jolly has happened no time fol
more but prepare for a surprise whet
next you hear from me  

   a rise in screw or maybe hes sold
picture-at last  his smile was hafi
amused half-bitter  well ive nevc
had any luck-perhaps its coming his w
instead t 

  rising abruptly he went into the tenw
and dispatched the frugal meal wbidjj
awaited him then filling his pipe hfj
came out again to wait for achmed ww
would presently bring the horses for tw
usual evening ride

  the swift twilight had come and pass
while he sat eating and now night la
mysterious silver star-lit upon the i
of the desert in the sky the great brig
stars hung in clusters and the moon w
rising sliding into view like a huge pi
of gold behind a clump of ragged palm-
it was very still very tranquil vc
peaceful yet in the heart of the tel
dweller there reigned no peace only
chaotic welter of emotion in whig
strangely for he was no egoist elf-p
had its place
kathlyn rhodes

 true he loved the desert loved to feel
 and slipping between his horses hoofs
 t ey thundered along in the opal dawn
  li the velvety moonlight loved to sit
 camp fires the nomads to listen
  heir songs to sleep liter to the throb-
 ovl luuaby  their uttle drums he
 c the solitude the complete unbroken
 potion 

    and yet there were times too when he
 rned lor hia kind when the home-loving
 which was implanted in the breasts
 art	primitive cave-dwellers rose

   threatened to overwhelm him with a
 g ision of a home    not merely a
 u but some dwelling sanctified by the
   woman with tender rye and
 y hair eyes and hair reproduced in
 miniature in the child who crept
 rjjjh to her side 

 this home might have been his
 jtr have been his li a woman had been
 her promise if a man had shown
 porthy of a life-long friendship

  wlyel ted to disclose

vats up achmcd   his own

eyes began to shine  is there some
lomasha in the village or what is it thats
making you so fey  out with it man
and if its allowable for a stranger to
participate why ill join in with all my

  suddenly the arabs expressive face grew
serious almost solemn it was evident
that in his dark soul he was debating some
weighty matter and amory stood motion-
less schooling himself to patience until
the decision should be made

  effendi-lus voice was hurried-
 there is much talk in the village to-night
it is said by one who knows that there
will be a tragedy in the karim of moussa
bey ere dawn treads the eastern sky with
rosy feet 

    a tragedy-in the karim 

   aiwa effendi for it is said that my
lord the bey returning from a journey
into the fayum discovered that a thief
liad sought to rob him of his choicest
treasure had laid plans to cull from his
garden the fairest rose i 

   which being interpreted means that
some inmate of the fiatim has been giving
the glad eye to an outsider i suppose  
he laughed cynically  well seeing what
an old swine the bey is i wouldnt blame
any of his beauties casting looks at a
handsome gardener  

   i do not understand your words
effendi achmed was affronted at this
light treatment of a serious subject  the
gltid-t  i know not what it means
yet it is like to be an unlucky matter for
the roumi who was discovered in the
gardens of the karim by my lord the bey
 hold on a minute achmed  his
voice was startled  whats that yon say
-the roumi  dyou mean an english-
mans been playing the fool with the beys
women  but there isnt an englishman
nearer than cairo  

   yet is it so effendi the man was
discovered in the moment of the beys
return by sclim the keeper of the karim
in the act of dallying with the beautiful
fatma  and was dragged before the bey
who cast him into the but at the entrance
to the gardens while he debated what fate
should be meted out to the wretched defilcr
of the karim

   but i say achmed this cant go on i 
at the hint of danger to a countryman
amory was another person as quick and
alert as he had before been indifferent un-
interested  why god only knows what
will happen ty the fellow if hes left to the
beys tender mercies  


hutchinsons story magazine

    allah truly may know but the mercies
 of shaitan wifi be more tender than those
 of my lord returned the arab calmly
  it is said that already selim has begun
 to sharpen his knife for flesh is tough
 and it would tarnish the pride of the
 fellow should he fail to slice off the roumis
 ears neatly at a blow  

    for gods sake shut up you callous
 brute   amory felt physical nausea at
 the words  dyou mean to say the bey
 will be devil enough to cut off the chaps
 cars  

   even so effendi achmed spoke
 sullenly not relishing the others epithets
  first the ears then perchance the fingers
 and the toes if my lords thirst for
 vengeance be then sated it may be he will
 let the roumi go but if not-who knows 
 there are hot irons which gouge out the
 eyes and it is possible for a clever man to
 slice off the nose at one stroke the
 tongue too it is easily tom from the
 mouth 

   good god achmed do you want to
 drive me mad  you stand there and coolly
 tell me a white man is to be tortured to
 death by that devil incarnate the bey-

    the roumi would have outraged the
 beys honour have defiled the pride of the
 harim achmed was still sullen  it is
 but justice that the lord of the household
 should avenge himself on the robber   

    but not with hot irons  amorys
 whole being was aflame at the thought of
 his compatriots danger  oh you cant
 see it of course i expect if the truth
 bo known you murdered your unfortunate
 brother in some pretty devilish fashion 
 but this thing has got to be stopped
 theres no time for the authorities to take
 a hand if the entertainment is to come off
 at dawn weve jolly well got to stop it
 but how  

   the arab stared aghast

    effendi what is the meaning of these
 words  it is madness surely which speaks
 in them  

   madness-no rather sheer horse
 sense i  amorys previous languor had
 dropped from him like an ill-fitting gar-
 ment he was a man of action once more
  you may do as you please but im
 going over yonder-he waved towards
 the villa- to have a shot at rescuing the
 poor brute

    but-eflendi it were folly to throw
 away ones life  he who guards the
 prisoner is selim the fiercest and strongest
 of all the guards--

  i dont care if shaitan himself guards

 the prisoner im going to get him out ol
 that hell-somehow t  he spoke reso-
 lutely and achmed realised he meant to
 do this thing

    effendi it is madness  h spo
 earnestly  selim will never permit t
 eflendi to approach the hut where
 guards the captive he will fight eflen
 to the death lest worse befall him at t
 hands of the bey his lord and he
 strong one blow from his fist  
 crrrc   he made a feint of collapsing
 the sand	

   strong eh  then we must op
strength with cunning he meditat
a moment  see here you know t
fellow is he fond of money-would it
possible to bribe him  

   achmed shook his head

    he is doubtless a thief as are all t
 hi rim guards scum that they are   
 spat virtuously into the sand  yet
 would be afraid to take a bribe 

    well for gods sake suggest so
 thing i would it be possible to make i
 drunk  i have a drug which easily p
 a man to sleep for an hour or two-
 achmed looked dubious

    that might be done effendi for
 is no true follower of the prophet and ha
 a fondness for wine but he would r
 drink with the effendi for even his thr

wits would suspect a trick-

   listen achmed  a light
sprung into amorys eyes  whats
prevent me dressing up in that arab rig
mine and posing as a date-merchant
something of the sort  it would w
natural for a stranger passing by to s
and speak-ask the way maybe and o
a drink in return for the information
very slowly a grin began to spread o
achmeds brown face for the plan
all its risks suited his bold nature
indeed the whole adventure was more
his liking than he chose to admit

  effendi it is a good plan in t
 this selim is a vain fellow for ever boa
 of his strength and h would be a pious
 to lay his pride in the dust

   quite so amory guessed s
that achmed bore the boastful selim
grudge  thats settled then y-j
know the man so you must keep in tt
background and ill do the pala
sawv  

    truly the eflendi is a great lead
 secure in his own immunity ach- t
 hastened to pour forth flattery 
 plan is good  and it were wise to set a
 it without delay indeed it is a
netprise-and allah they say loves ever
a bold and courageous spirit 

   half

an hour later two riders drew rein
the outskirts of the beys gardens the
in which the captive languished
bearded by the mighty selini was just
without the confines of the great domain
 a strongly constructed place

ol stone with a massive door and

s n the windowless walls

tha n dcne oi palms lad hidden
 approach of the horsemen from the
djjii of the hut and from behind a
rvenient tree the riders were able to
jpy out the land noting how the giant
squatted on the sand a box of
before lum while he made shift
t-handed to play a travesty of the
game  beloved of the arabs

ul w tbat tlic goal was in sht achmed
suddenly to grow apprehensive
bifted uneasily in his saddle moistened
vt ps and shot queer restless glances at
ter out of the corners of bis eyes
to teo something was tormenting
by no means unduly sensitive conscience
 achmed ben hassan and he was
derinf whether it were wiser to keep
still or to make a clean breast of
atter which troubled him

hsfsently amory noticed his palpable
ines and his voice was a trifle sharp
questioned the man

ill j hats the matter-got a fit of nerves

th   joans chest is weak and so
 ipl 	her out to egypt--

       you learn the name ol the rouiui

kathlyn rhodes

achmed ben hassan   his manner was
stern

     even that my lord since inadvertently
the roumi dropped an envelope upon
which was written his direction-

   the name-quick for allahs sake
the name 

  very slowly debating within himself
whether be acted wisely the arab produced
a torn and dirty envelope which he yielded
to the snatching hand held out for it

  the other man took it looked at it
fastidiously read the name-and his blood
ran like fire in his veins for the name
on the envelope was that of his supplanter
gerald dorrien

   the night was passing all too rapidly for
the work which had yet to be done

   in the stone house a couple ol hundred
yards away a man crouched waiting in
blank terror lor the dawn which should
bring him a horrible death and ere long
the stars would begin to wane before the
light of day

  yet christopher amory sat motionless
on his horse with god knows what thoughts
passing through his brain

   here at last was an opportunity to get
even with his supplanter he had but to
simulate a sudden cowardice to throw up
the game and dorrien would go to his
death helpless as a stricken animal
vengeance for his treachery had been slow
but sure he who had betrayed his friend
should in his turn be betrayed and the
mental torture he had inflicted on a living
mans soul should be expiated by the pangs
ol physical anguish

   yet as he sat on his horse an ominously
still figure in the moonlight amorys brow
was wet for he knew well enough that
this was a shameful thing which he pro-
posed to do to allow a man to die
horribly at the hands of a coloured torturer
in order that a thirst lor revenge might be
slaked-it was a crime at which the lowest
criminal might well shudder   

  and yet-this roan had done him the
worst injury a man could do had done it
moreover under the guise ol friendship
and no death could be too vile for tie
traitor

  tliat the woman would sutler did he
allow this man to die he knew well enough
but in his present mood lie could look even
on her prospective sufferings unmoved

   on every hand he felt his inaction to be
justified and yet-dorrien was a com-
patriot they were brothers in the midst
of an alien people and it was not according


hutchinsons story magazine

to the standards of english chivalry to
allow an englishman to be tortured to
death at the hands of an inferior race   

  half a dozen yards away achmed the
chcerful slayer of the brother who had
betrayed him waited silently aware that
some conflict whose nature he could not
determine was being waged beneath the
eftcndis passive exterior for his part
he was anxious to get the matter done with
since ever moments delay increased the
probability of detection yet something
a force which he felt but could not analyse
kept him silent as the minutes sped

  suddenly amory raised his head the
battle was over and he had lost his
personal vengeance must wait while com-
mon humanity rescued the hated prisoner
from the death no englishman should die
but the emotion with wliich he set about
his risky lark was very different from the
spirit of high adventure in which the risk
had been so joyfully undertaken

  the rescue was simple enough after nil
to selim the presence of the suppo ed date-
merchant was easily accountable and
he gave the required directions glibly
pleased possibly by the welcome break in
the monotony of his watch while an
invitation to a cup of wine was equally
welcome amory had made no mistake
in his preparation of the draught and
ten minutes later the giant lay in a slumber
so deep that the further proceedings of the
night hold no interest for him

  the key of the hut abstracted from his
clothing the door readily yielded to
pressure and a minute afterwards amory
entered the noisome place his heart no
longer beating with excitement but
throbbing heavily with resentment against
the file which had placed him in the
position of saviour to his enemy

  the man who crouched in the darkest
corner of the hut muttering wild prayers
did not look up at the entry of the sup-
posed arab rather he shrank farther
back into the shadow certain poor wretch
that his doom was upon him and lacking
the courage to face that dreadful doom as
a man should do

  even in the midst of his distaste amory
felt a cold contempt for the cowartlv
shrinking and in spite of himself his voice
vibrated with hatred as he said bending
over the dimly-seen huddled form 

    come lorrien you neednt stop here

shivering the door is open and you can
get outside as fast as you like

	there was no reply only a sort of in
stantaneous stiffening came over the
trembling form as though the captive were
struck suddenly to a petrified attention
and amory fei ling his dislike for the job
increasing momentarily made no attempt
to disguise the harshness of his tone as he
condescended to further urgings

    youd better clear out if you dont
want that black devil to interfere puu
yourself together man youre safe i
tell you if youll only take a brace on
yourself and get out while theres time

  still the man made no effort to obey
and losing all patience amory shook him
roughly by the shoulder and turned him
round to face his deliverer

  the next moment a great cry rang
through the lnit but t was the rescuer
not the rescued who shrank back appalled
at the realisation of the thing he had so
nearly done

  the man who but for his intervention
would have died shamefully at dawn was
his brother ivor

   chris  oh my god you  get me
out of this hole for christs sake quick
-dont stand staring at me ill explain
-everything-afterwards 

  as one in a dream amory pointed to the
open door and as one in a dream the boy
stumbled through it ordered by a
gesture to mount behind his brother be
obeyed and a moment later three rode
back across the desert whence only two
had come

  as the dawn began to break in the
eastern sky amory stood before his tent
watching half a dozen arabs riding towards
cairo one of them was strangely fair
his eyes oddly blue for an arab but his
dress was that of a native and few would
challenge him or his hardy escort

  explanations between the brothers had
b en brief the surprise of which ivor
hid written was the invitation of dorrien
to accompany him and his wife to cairo
and he had ridden out to el-khatum mean-
ing to take his brother unawares thafj
he had turned aside lured by a par 
dark eyes taking a forbidden peep over the
haritn wall was merely an accident-whicftj
had been like to end in a tragedy and as
for the envelope bearing dorriens name

seen on the reverse side a rough sketch of
the route from cairo

  thoroughly sobered by his narrow escape
from death ivor had bidden his brother
a shamefaeed good-bye stammering out
broken words of gratitude cut short
roughly by the older man  and now amory
stood alone his whole being still vibrating
with the thrill which had come when he
realised that but for the grace of god
he would have been the slayer of his
brother

  mind and body shuddered alike at the
contemplation of the black abyss into
which his soul misled by thoughts of
vengeance had so nearly slipped and
when at length he turned away and called
achmed to him even that light-hearted
villain noted though without comprehen-
sion the look of something akin to awe in
the effendis eyes

   strike the tent achmed and let us be
off to the south he spoke curtly  the
sooner we are out of el-
ivhatum the better so look
sharp about it

    it shall be done effendi

the arab was well pleased

with the prospect of change  an hour
for coffee and we may go our way

   you can get your coffee and come after
me the horses are rested and i start at

once

  the arab startled opened his lips to
protest but a further look at his masters
face sealed even his ever-ready tongue 
and he stood by while amory vaulted into
the saddle and turned his horses head
towards the south

   an revoir for a little while achmed
ben hassan his voice held a hint of
cynicism  we shall meet again pres-
ently we are fit companions you and i
you slew your brother and i saved mine i
but allah knows there is precious little
diiterence between us after all i 

  and while the arab stood looking after
him in perplexity and the sun rose joyously
over the empty sands he waved his hand
in ironical farewell and cantered south-
wards into the desert

the night was filled with vanilla and

the mass of humanity does the poly-

of a belief seems to hint at reality in

tabu is universal you find men here

english society-its all the same thing
under different disguises

    funny that talking of ghosts we should
have touched on this for when i asked you
did you believe in ghosts i had a ghost story
in mind and tabu conics into it this is it

  and this is the story somewhat as told
by lygon

  some fifty years back when pease was
a pirate bold and hayes in his bloom
and the topsails of the leonora a terror to
all dusky beholders maru was a young
man of twenty he wan son of malemake
king of fukariva a kingdom the sire of
a soup plate nearly as round and without
a middle-an atoll island in short just a
ring of coral sea beaten and circling like
a bezel a sapphire lagoon

  fukariva lies in the paumotus or
dangerous archipelago where the currents
run every way and the trades are unac-
countable the underwriters to this day
fight shy of a paumotus trader and in
the os few ships came here and the few
that came were on questionable business
maru up to the time he was twenty years
of age only remembered three

  there was the spanish ship that came
into the lagoon when he was seven
the picture of her remained with him
burning and brilliant yet tinged with
the atmosphere of nightmare a big top-
sail schooncr that lay for a week mirroring
herself on the lagoofl water whilst she
refitted fellows with red handkerchiefs tied
ronnd their heads crawling aloft and laying
out on the spars they came ashore for
water and what they could find in the way
of taro and nuts and made hay on the
bcach insulting the island women till the
men drove them off then when she was
clearing the lagoon a brass gun was run
oat and fired leaving a score of dead and
wounded on that salt white strand

  that was the spaniard then came a
whaler who took what she wanted and
cut down trees for fuel and departed
leaving behind the smell of her as an
enduring recollection and lastly when
maru was about eighteen a little okl
schooner slank in one early morning

   she lay in the lagoon like a mangy dog
a humble ship very unlike the spaniard
or the blustering whaleman she only
wanted water and a few vegetables and
her men gave no trouble  then one evening
she alank out again with the ebb but she
left something behind her-smallpox it
cloared the island and of the hundred
and fifty subjects of king malemake
only ten were left-twelve people in all
counting the king and maru

  the king died of a broken heart an
age and of the eleven people left thr
were women widows of men who had di
of the smallpox	j

  maru was unmarried and as the kinij
of the community he might have collected
the women for his own household
he had no thought of anything but gri
grief for his father and the people w
were gone he drew apart from t
others and the seven widowers began
arrange matters as to the distribution d
the three widows they began wf
arguments and ended with clubs ti
men were killed and one of the wo
killed another man because he had brai
the man of her fancy

  then the dead were buried in the lag

-maru refusing to help because of
tabu-and the three newly married cou
settled down to live their lives leaving m
out in the cold he was no longer ki
the women despised him because he hadn
fought for one of them and the men
cause he had failed in brutality and lea
ship they were a hard lot true survi
of the fittest and maru straight as a p
tree dark eyed genuc and a drea
seemed amongst them like a man
another tribe and time

  he lived alone and sometimes in ts
sun blaze on that great ring of coral
fancied he saw the spirits of the de
walking as they had walked in life
sometimes at night he thought he h
the voice of his father chiding him

  when the old man died marn had
fused to touch the body or help in
burial filial love his own salvat
nothing would have induced maru to
his tabu

  it was part of him an iron reef in
character beyond the touch of will

   ii

  on morning some six weeks after
this marrying and settling down
came into the lagoon she was a bl
birder the portsoy owned and capt
by colin robertson a banffshire
hence the name of his brig ro
and his men landed took off water c
nuts baiianas and everything else
could find worth taking then t
turned their attention to the popula
four men were not a great find
robertson was not above trifles he
cruited them that is to say he

board the portsoy leaving the 
widows-grass widows now-wailing

  he felt no grief but there came to him
a new and strange thing a silence that
the shipboard sounds could not break
sincc birth the eternal boom of the waves
on coral had been in his cars night and
day and day and night-louder in storms
but always there it was gone tbat
was why despite the sound of the bow
wash and boost of the waves and the
creak of cordage and block the brig seemed
to have carried marn into the silmce of
a new world

  they worked free of the paumotua into
the region of settled winds and accountable

a world of wind and waves and sky
desolate of life and for maru the land of
nowhere

   so it went on from week to week and
 as far as lie was concerned so it might have
 gone on for ever he knew nothing of
 the world into which he had been suddenly
 snatched and land which was not a ring
 of coral surrounding a lagoon was for him
 unthinkable

   he knew nothing of navigation and the
 brass-bound wheel at which a sailor was
 always standing with his hands on the
 spoktti now twirling it this way now that
 had for him a fascination beyond words
 the fascination of a strange toy for a little
 child and something more it was the
 first wheel he had ever seen and its move-
 ments about its axis seemed magical and
 it was never left without some one to hold
 it and move it-why  the mystery of
 the binnacle into which the wheel-movcr
 was always staring as a man stares into
 a rock pool after fish was almost as
 fascinating

   maru peeped into the binnacle one day
 and saw the fish like a star-fish yet
 trembling and moving like a frightened
 thing then some one kicked him away
 and he ran forward and hid feeling that
 he had pried into the secrets of the
 white mens gods and fearing the con-
 sequences

  but the white mens gods were not
confined to the wheel and binnacle down
below they had a god that could warn
them of the weather for that day at noon
and for no apparent reason the sailors
began to strip the brig of her canvas
then the sea rose and two hours later
the cyclone seized them it blew every-
thing away and then took rhem into its
calm heart where dancing like giants in
dead still air and with the sea for a ball-
room floor the hundred-foot-high waves
broke the portsoy to pieces

   maru alone was saved clinging to a
piece of hatch cover half stunned con-
fused yet unafraid and feeling vaguely
that the magic wheel and the trembling
fish god had aomehow betrayed the white
men he knew that he was not to die
because this strange world that had taken
him from his islamd had not done with
him yet and the sea in touch with him
like this and half washing over him at
times had no terror for him for he had
learned to swim before he had learned to
walk also his stomach was full he had
been eating biscuits whilst the portsoys
canvas - was being stripped away and

   though the wind was strong enough at
most to whip the food from his hands
the peaceful swell that followed tw
cyclone was a thing enough to have drive
au ordinary man mad with terror noj
lifted hill high on a glassy slope the whow
wheel of the horizon camc to view und
the breezing wind and blazing sun thefl
gently down-sliding the hatch cover woulfl
sink to a valley bottom only to cliinl
again a glassy slope and rise again h
high into the wind and sun foam flecw
passed on the surfacc and in the grem
sun dazzled crystal of the valley floo
he glimpsed strips of fucus floating frfl
down torn by the storm from their rocll
attachments and through the slopiijfl
wall of glass up which the hatch covtfl
was climbing he once glimpsed a shard
lifted and cradled in a ridge of the grem
swell strange to see as a fly in amber 
a fish in ice	i

  the hatch cover was sweeping with i
four-knot current moving with a whojfl
world of things concealed or half-seen 
hinted at a sea currcnt is a streeti
is more it is a moving pavement for tt
people of the sea jcllv fish were ix-mfl
carried with maru on the great swell rui
ning with the current a turtle broke tjjl
water close to him and plunged again a
onee a white roaring reef passed by osum
a few cable lengths he could see theroc
exposed for a moment and the water closiflfl
 it in a tumble of foam

   for a day and a night and a day and  i
night the voyage continued the swflj
falling to a gentle licave and then in  
dawn camc a sail the mat sail of a caofsa
like a brown wing cut against the halious
shell coloured sky	jb

  in the canoe was a girl naked as tmm
new moon paddle in hand and h 
crouching she drove the canoe towah
him the sail loose and flapping in the win
then he was on board the canoc but
he got there he scarcely knew the wwt
tiling was like a dream within a drcadbn
in the canoe there was nothing neitlf
food nor water only some fishing
and as he lay exhausted consumed wfjj
thirst and faint with hunger he saw 
girl resetting the sail she had
fishing last evening from an island tyjj
north and blown out to sea by a sqfljgl
hd failed to mklce the land again
she had sighted an island in the souwas-
and was making for it when she saw

hatch cover and the brown clinging form
of maru

   as he lay half dead in the bottom of
lhe canoe he watched her as she crouched
with eyes fixed on the island and the steer-
paddle in hand  but before they could
reach it a squall look them half filling the
canoe with rain water and maru drank and
hank till his ribs stood out and thcn
renewed half rose as the canoe steered
by the girl rushed past tumbling green
teas and a broken reef to a beach white
alt towards which the great trees
came down with the bread fruits dripping
with the new-fallen rain and the palms
heading like whips in the wind

   talia that was her name and though her
language was diiferent from the tongue
maru it had a likeness of a sort in
mose days that little island was uncharted
nd entirely desolate but for tho gulls
f the reef and the birds of the woods
nd it was a wonderland to maru whose
dea of land as a sea-beaten ring of coral
was shattered by woods that bloomed
rreii as a sea cave to the moonlight
high ground where rivulets danced amidst
the fern and a beach protected from the
outer seas by a far-flung line of reels
talia to him was as wonderful as the
island she had come to him out of the
tea she had saved his life he was as
hfferent from the women of the pau-
tnotus as day from night a european
wpuld have called hcr beautiful but
maru had no thought of her beauty or
her sex she was just a being beneficent
almost divorced from earth the strangest
hing in the strange world that fate had
tewed him into part with the great heav-
swell he had ridden so long the turtle
at had broken up to look at him the
pouting reef the sunsets over wastes of
watir and the stars spread over the wastes

of sljy

he worshipped her in his way and he
jjigut have worshipped her at a greater
tance only for the common bond of
vouth between them and the incessant
 of the world around them tall a
ra practical she seemed to have forgotten
pr people and that island up north and
live entirely in the moment they
ade two shacks in the bushes and she
him island wood-era ft and the
of berries and fruit that he had never
before also when to fish in the lagoon 
j a month after they reached the island

the poisonous season arrived and talia
knew it how who can tell  she knew
many things by instinct-the approach
of storms and when the poisonous season
had passed the times for fishing  and little
by little their tongues that had almost
been divided at first became almost one
so that they could chatter together on
all sorts of tilings and she could tell him
that her name was talia the daughter of
tepairu that hcr island was named
makca that her people had twenty canoes
big ones and many little ones and that
tepairu was not the name of a man but
a woman that tepairu was queen or
chief woman of her people now that her
husband was dead

  and maru was able to tell her by degrees
of what he could remember of the old
spanish ship and how she sponted smoke
and thunder and killed the beach people
of his island and its shape-he drew it on
the sand and talia who knew nothing
of atolls at first refused to believe in it
thinking he was jesting of his father
who was chief man or king of fukariva
and of the destruction of the tribe thcn
he told of the ship with the little wheel
-he drew it on the sand-and the little
fish god of the centre of the cyclone
where the waves were like while datcing
men and of his journey on the hatch cover
across the blue heaving sea

  they would swim in the lagoon together
right out to the reefs where the great
rollers were always breaking and out
there talia always seemed to remember
her island pointing north with her eyes
fixed across the sea dazzle as though she
could see it and her people and the twenty
canoes beachcd on the spume-white beach
beneath the palms

   some day they will come said talia
she knew her people those sea rovers
inconsequent as the gulls some day for
some reason or none one of the fishing
canoes would fish as far as this island cr
be blown there by some squall she would
take maru back with her she told him
this

  the thought began to trouble maru
then he grew gloomy he was in love
love had hit him suddenly somehow
and in some mysterious manner she had
changed from a beneficent being and part
of a dream to a girl of flesh and wood
she knew it and at the same moment he
turned for her into a man

  ltp to this she had had no thought of him
except as an individual for all her dreams
about him he might as well have been a

palm tree but now it was different and
in a flash he was everything the surf
on tho reef said maru and flie wind in
the trees maru and the gulls fishing and
crying at the break had one word maru
maru maru

   then one day swimming out near the
 bigger break in the reefs a current drove
 them together their shoulders touched
 and marus arm went round her and
 amidst the blue laughing sea and the
 shouting of the gulls lie told her that the
 whole world was talia and as lie told her
 and as she listened the current of the ebb
 like a treacherous hand was drawing them
 through the break towards the devouring
 sea

   they had to fight their way back the
 ebb just beginning would soon be a mill
 race and they knew and neither could
 help the other it was a hard struggle
 for jove and life against the enmity
 against life and love that hides in all
 things from the heart of man to the heart
 of tlie sea but they won they had
 reached calm waters and were within
 twenty strokes of the beach when talia
 cried out suddenly and sank

   maru who was slightly in front turned
 and found her gone she had been seized
 with cramp the cramp that comes from
 over-exertion but he did not know that
 the lagoon was free of harks but despite
 that fact and the fact that he did not fear
 them lie fancied for one fearful moment
 that a shark had taken her

   then he saw her below a dusky form
 on the coral floor and he dived

   he brought her to the surface reached
 the sandy beach and carrying her in his
 arms ran with her to tho higher level of
 the sands and placed her beneath the
 shade of the trees she moved in his arms
 as he carried her and when he laid her
 down her breast heaved in one great
 sigh water ran from her mouth her
 limbs stiffened and she moved no more

   then all the world became black for
 maru  he knew nothing of the art of resus-
 citating the drowned talia was dead

   he ran amongst the trees crying out
 that lalia was dead he struck himself
 against tree boles and was tripped in-
 ground lianas the things of the forest
 seemed trying to kill him too then he
 hid amongst the ferns lying on his face
 and telling the earth that talia was dead
 then came sundown and after that the
 green moonlight of the woods and sud-
 denly sleep with a vision of blue laughing
 sea and talia swimming beside him and

 then day again and with the day the vision
 of talia lying dead beneath the trees

 he could not bury her he could not
touch her the iron reef of his tabu
held firm indestructible unalterable as the
main currents of the sea

   he picked fruits and ate them like an
 animal and without knowing that he ate
 torn towards the beach by the passionate
 desire to embrace once more the form
 that he loved but held from the act by
 a grip ten thousand years old and immut-
 able as gravity or the spirit that lives in
 religions

   he must not handle the dead through
 all his grief came a weird tonch of comfort
 she had not been dead when he carried
 her ashore he had not touched the dead

   then terrible thoughts came to him of
 what would happen to talia if he left
 her lying there of what predatory gulls
 might do he had some knowledge of
 these matters and past visions of what
 had happened on fukariva when the dead
 were too numerous lor burial came to him
 making him shiver like a whipped dog
 he could at all events drive the birds
 away without touching her without even
 looking at her his presence on the beach
 would keep the birds away it was near
 noon when this thought came to him he
 had been lying on the grouud but he sat
 up now as though listening to this thought j
 then he rose up and came along cautiously
 amongst the trees as he came the
 rumble of the reef grew louder and the
 sea wind began to reach him through the
 leaves then the light of the day grew
 stronger and slipping between the palm
 boles he pushed a great bread-fruit leaf
 aside and peeped and there on the blind-
 ing beach under the forenoon sun more
 clearly even than he had seen the ghosts
 of men on fukariva he saw the ghost of
 talia walking by the sea and wringing
 its hands

   then the forest took him again mad
 this time with terror

  when on fukariva he had seen the
ghosts of men walking in the sun blaze
on the coral he had felt no terror  he had
never seen them except on waking from
sleep beneath some tree and the sight of
them had never lasted for more than a
moment he had said to himself  they
are the spirits of the departed and they
had seemed to him part of the scheme of
things like reflections cast on the lagoon
or the spirit voices heard in the wind
or dreams or the ships that had come from
nowhere and departed nowhere

hutchinsons story magazine

  but the ghost of talia was different
from these it was in some tremendous
way real and it wept because the body
of talia lay unburied

  he had made it weep

   he alone could give it rest

   away deep in the woods hiding amongst
the bushes springing alive with alarm at
the slightest sound he debated this matter
with himself and curiously now love did
not move him at all or urge him-it was
as though the ghost of talia had stepped
between him and his love for talia not
destroying it but obscuring it talia for
him had become two things the body he
had left lying  the sand under the trees
and the ghost he had seen walking on
the beach  the real talia no longer existed
for him exccpt as the vaguest wraith he
lay in the bushes facing the fact that so
long os the body lay unburied the ghost
would walk it might even leave the
beach and come to him

  this thought brought him from his
hiding-place-he could not lie alone with
it amongst the bushes and then he fouud
that he could not stand alone with it
amongst the trees for at any moment
she might appear wringing her hands in
one of the glades or glide to his side from
behind one of the tree boles

  he made for the southern beach

  although unused to woods till he
reached this island he had the instinct
for direction a brain compass more mys-
terious than the trembling star-fish that
had directed the movements of the wheel ori
board the portsoy making due south
amidst the gloom of the trees he reached
the beach where the sun was blazing on
the sands and the birds flying and calling
over the lagoon the reef lay far out
a continuous line uulike the reefs to the
north continuous but for a single break
through which the last of the ebb was
flowing out oilily mirroring a palm tree
that stood like the warden of the lagoon
the sound of the surf was low the wind
had died away and as maru stood watch-
ing and listening peace came to his dis-
tracted soul

  he felt safe here even when talia
had been with him the woods had always
seemed to him peopled with lurking things
unused as he was to trees in great masses 
and now released from them and touched
again by the warmth of the sun he felt
safe it seemed to him that the ghost
could not come here the gulls said jt
to him and the flashing water and as he
lay down on the sands the surf on the reef

said it to him it was too far away for
the ghost to come it seemed to him
that he had travelled many thousand
miles from a country remote as his extreme
youth losing everything on the way but
a weariness greater than time could hold
or thought take recognition of

  then he fell asleep and he slept whilst
the sun went down into the west and the
flood swept into the lagoon and the st
broke out above that tremendous sleep
unstirred by the vaguest dream lasted tilt
the dawn was full

  then he sat up renewed as though 
ckd had remade him in mind and body

  a gull was strutting on the sands by
the waters edge its long shadow struttii
after it and the shadow of the gull 
straight as a javelin into the renewed
mind of maru talia was not dead he
had not seen her ghost she had coioe to
life and had been walking by the sea
wringing her hands for him thinking him i
drowned for the form he had seen 
walking on the sands had cast a shadow
he remembered that now ghosts do not j
cast shadows

  and instantly his mind made reasonable-i
by rest and sleep re visualised the picture 
that had terrified his mind distraught by
grief that was a real form-what folly i
could have made him doubt it talia 
was alive-alive warm and waiting for 
him on the northern beach and the love j
for her that fear had veiled rushed ittj
upon him and seized him with a great
joy that made him shout aloud as lie 
sprang to his feet yet with a pain at his-
heart like the pain of a rankling spearj
wound as he broke through the tree
shouting as he ran talia t talia tulia 

  he passed the bushes where he had i
hidden and the ferns he heard the sound 
of the surf coining to meet him he sa
the veils of the leaves divide and the
blaze of light and morning splendour oo
the northern sands and lagoon and sea- 

  he stood and locked

  nothing

  he rau to the place w here he had laid j
her beneath the trees there was still
faintly visible the slight depression made
by her body and close by strangely and
clearly cut the imprint of a little foot

  nothing else

  he stood and called and called and n
answer came but the wood echo and th 
sound of the morning wind then he ra
to the sea edge then he knew

  the sand was trodden up and on tli 
hand clear cut and fresh lav the marl

 n by the feet of the men who hail beached
 and floated her again

out beyond the thundering foam of
ref to the blue and heaving sea

   never said lygon  the islands

a gong that stood close to his chair struck
it three times and the sounds passing into
the night mixed with the voices of the
canoe men returning from fishing on the reef

  then a servant came on to the verandah
an old old man half bent like a withered
tree

that seemed still searching for what the

 were arguing

   he had been lying as was i flat on his
 back bis hands beneath his head his voice
 coming sepulchrally from beneath his hat
 pulled like mine over his face against the
 sun

   he sat up with a jerk that brought his
 hands to his toes and turned his head
 towards me  dont you worry thats
 what im talking about thats just a case
 in point for you and a pretty hot one i
 dont mind telling you youre the first man
 outside of me and another thatll hear it

 look here youre one of these writing chaps
 make a story out of this

   i said  good enough and snuggled my
 head and adjusted my hat against the sun
 a bit more comfortably to doze off in my
 capacity as one of those writing chaps i had
 been given stories before good enough
 go ahead

    whatll you call it  

    call it  man alive how the devil do
  know

   this was the rottenest way of being
pleasantly lulled to sleep by a story-the
way of the man who keeps digging you in
the ribs with questions all the time so i
spoke irritably and finished  how do i
know  i dont even know what its about
 i tell you -he had assumed an
annoyingly deep voice as though he really
had something big to tell- i tell you its
about what i was saying about how a bit
of luck always cuts in when a mans up
against it cuts in this side or that and
about a case in point right here in breaking
out of this prison

   infernally annoying getting much too
 near to be pleasantly drowsifying i
 couldnt help saying in surprise-and how
 can you sleep if youre going to be sur-
 prised -

    here was it  this prison  

   it seemed to annoy him but how was
i to know 

    here  of coursc it was here  dam it
 it was right there on that very road where
 those chaps are working now

   i echoed his  darn it  what was  
  why the breakaway this breakaway
 from that prison that im going to tell you
 about look theres the very spot see
 those two boulders on the leit of the road
 and how the moor gets up into a bit of an
 embankment on the right  see  

   i could tell he was pointing and waiting
 for ma and i have suffered all my life from
 an infernal politeness which makw brusque-
 ness almost impossible in me moreover the
 story was starting with an annoying
 realism that i knew would prove delusive-
 they always do-but which insisted on
 attention so i groaned and struggled up
 to sitting position and squinted at his
 beastly boulders and embankment and
 grunted and lay down again

   no peace well whatll you call it
 then   he demanded

  oh h- i cast back to what he had

 said when he first put tho question some-
 thing about the bit of luck in everything
 wasnt it   what about  the bit of
 luck    i grunted into my hat

   couldnt see him but conld feci he was

mentally visualising this suggestion in
apparently he found a dramatic look a
it-imagined it in the sprawling 
headline capitals of a cheap lust
magazine i suppose  yes thats g
he said  thats what it was an
it sure was right now ill start
he started and i went to sleep   
he droned i suppose heaven kn
how long and i slept a question aro
me one of his fatuous questions a
names  whatll i call him   he
saying  eh  

   how on earth was i to know i  j
even know who he was talking about
alone whether it was an adjective or a s
name he wanted to apply to the chap
raised my heavy lids the sun refli
through my hat showed me the ma
name  call him tabor i suggested

  he commented doubtfully  tat
rum name

    makes rum hats i muttered it
a poor hat

    what  

    i say he was a rum chap

  the wild shot was obviously good
obviously pleased him the sul
of an attentive listener he said pie

 he was wasnt he  rum i he s
was yes thats good a rum name fo
rum chap clever that i suppose
writing chaps get into the knack of
right well call him tabor not a z-
like his real name  and thats right tj
isnt it  	js

    saves trouble i agreed  libels 
all that

    well there he was you see he weat

 brooding over the prison what
 ttoifv whul his job was i never knew
  to  ed to conintutr till he pave me

 to conjecture till he gave me
 in the course of it-when he

 got me- interested-i guessed once or twice
 but wrongly i think at its conclusion 
 guessed again and not far of i imagine i
 thought first he was the man tabor himself 
 but he clearly wasnt-the stuff about the
 stenographer and later his own part in the
 business dished that i thought last-and
 i suspicion it still-that he had taken on
 tabors job  the odd job you shall hear in
 a minute tabor dead perhaps or by
 jove it comes to me in prison again
 perhaps  and his money and his enthu-
 siasm left to this chap hed have been a
 good man for it anyway a biggish chap
 taller than he looked because of his per-
 fectly artormous chest and shoulders arms
 to match brown as mahogany and about
 as hard-he seemed to wear a singlet and
 no shirt and the sleeves of his flannel
 jacket slipping back disclosed the terrific
 limbs they covered hands to match
 and face curiously kind of thrusting for-
 ward cheekbones and the skin stretched
 very tight but without hollows or gaunt-
 ness seemed to be from or to have lived in
 canada or the states by some of his speech
 but-well what does it matter anyway 
 there he was and this is his story

   next thing i heard him saying was one
 of the most painful questions a polite man
 -who knows hes guilty-can have ad-
 dressed to him-

    youre not asleep arc you 

   i muttered into my hat  rather not
 and found to my great discomfort of mind
 that the man tabor was now out of prison
 again- well there he was a free man
 again -and the story presumably ended
 without my having the faintest notion how
 he had effected this wonderful escape of
 his  laid there wide awake now trying to
 catch a hint of how it had been done  and
 then suddenly realised that the story far
 from being ended was only just beginning 
 that this man tabor hadnt escaped or
 tried to but had served his time and been
 released and that the prison-breaking wit h
 the bit of luck that was to be the point of it
 all was by tabor contrived-for another
 man  to get another man out of the just
 short of seven years unthinkable hell hed
 been through himself sat up and began to
 take notice

   was invited at the outset to imagine thin
 poor devil tabor free again and come back to
  wife dead kid dead mother dead he didnt
 mention if the stenographer was dead also
 -all i us world but his young brother dead
 as ashes  and in the place where his heart
 used to be a live coal of scorching flaming
 hate against the laws that had taken such
 toll of him for his one mad slip that and


hutchinsons story magazine

an appalling horror of the thought that
other men clcan as he blameless but for
that accurscd juxtaposition of trial and
temptation as ho were going through what
he hal been through- down there

   look its this way down there and
in all the long-sentence convict prisons
theres two classes of convicts different as
chalk and cheese ones the born criminal
ready-made for the job just as much as the
born poet you know the typo born in
crime dragged up in crime lives in crime
and dies in crime born in a filthy slum
room three or four other families living in
it filthy slum mother never knew his
father mother probably didnt either
has a drop of gin to keep him quiet as often
as a drop of milk blasphemes fluently
before hes cut all his teeth grows up true
to type cant you see him  sloping
forehead sloping chin sloping shoulders
thick ears sticking straight out rotten
teeth pigeon chest arms like an ape
reaching to his knees goes to prison on long
sentence as soon as hes old enough and lives
there permanently for the rest of his life in
intervals of ticket of leave

   the other type  ah by dam  other
types the mail like tabor clean honest
gentle sudden impulse sudden necessity
and opportunity finds himself down there
warders all know ljis sort always see it
go the same way starts with the old habits
says thank you arid please stands
upright moves briskly keeps his eyes
wide open bit by bit day by day month
by month-ah man alive  eternal grinding
year by eternal grinding year the prison
shuts down on him and crushes him down
down just as if the roof and walls of his cell
were contracting on him down he goes
bit by bit the  thank vous  go and
the  pleases  go and the straight back
goes and the brisk walk goes and the wide
eyes go everything that was in him goes
and they let him loose and he shuffles out
and he finds everything that was of him
gone just hate left in him and horror
like tabor

   now look tabor lwing the sort of
chap he had been had the horror of it all
uppermost hed not been out a week
when a forgotten relative in australia or
some darn place died in-just like they do
in stories iu-what is it  

   intestate

   sure intestate and left him quite a
respectable little pot of money wouldnt
you think hed clear off somewhere strange
and quiet and start in to sit down and get
back to life and enjoy it  wouldnt you  

  i nodded assent

    do you know he set up right tit
london and set down to the darn
idea ever prison snatcher c
snatcher had the craze -and by d
was right he sure was-that escape
be worked from outside if a word co
got to the chap before he went in-

  i interposed  but how could that
done  

   right when the chap was sent
listen to me tabor set himself to s
court every criminal sessions and if
a clcan chap like he had been
there by sudden chance and impul
hed been brought there to get in
with the chaps relatives-old fati
poor wife or some such-and say to

	look when you go down to the eft
say good-bye to that boy of yours tell
 hope theres a sport going to
you hope never give up hope

soon or late he says hell get you o
he sure will he says youre never to
up hoping get up every morning sa

it will sure to be to-day  and go to bed
night saying it will sure be to-e-
he says  watch for it keep bright
jump right at it when it comes alv
ready to jump right at it when it
itll come boy it sure will hope

   that was tabors idea-to k
good man from going down down dowr
prison crushes him down by giving m
hope to keep the  thank yous

	pleases and the straight back and thebgj
walk and the wide eye in him by
and to yank him out before ever the
began to crumple

  he leant forward and tapped me
sivcly on the knee

   by dam  dyou know who til tb
first cate of the sort tabor was
that came up into the dock under hirnfj
watching in the gallery  it was hi 
young brother

  he certainly had me surprised hv 
development i suppose another jhb
my place would have remarked cf
that these sudden these guiltless
seemed rather to run in the tabor 
but i never can say that sort of
sometimes im glad i auit i	

he made a pretty good at least a
natural case for tabor the younger- fi
was sudden and unpremeditated
another kind in three words 
with intent and in half a dozen
who was no better than b
been and another man and	g

        again until his brother down in the
 us below the court tears running down
 j face was whispering to him the words
 a had meant to communicate to a prisoner
 jthinkablc pain to have to say to his own
 oolised young brother
 jihope old man never lose hope you
 wow i was going to get other chaps out of
 fhere youre going my god i never
 rlpaght itd be you dear old man itll
  the more sure all the quicker watch
 rc it old man day and night watch
 ep good-bye old man

 ft was just over a year that he had to
pe and to watch for it as things turned
bff- the end of that time found tabor
 younger after brief sojournings in
ous jails lodged at the prison that lay
jour view  and now at last i was given
r straight story of the escape and began
mbjk ouc for the  bit o luck which
been promised as the pith of the
venture

	-t tabor came and lived down hero spent
sjsttb watching from this very rise where
sit and worked out his plan then
hs when i came into it id arranged to
rjjp him he came up to town to me
 ing to get young bill-that was his
rjjhcri name-out of it this month h-
me  youre on    sure   you
p  drive a car    sure thing most any
tome	ook at one tve

 i by darn that was a car last thing off
 y market in autos and left the rest like
 fnettes six-cylinder pelham-flyte

     what made me wince was her colour
 jgrht scarlet bright -it made every
  r d ever seen look like tinned salmon

to rns hnn away in that says

        to

 by darn  youre going to advertise

	ttljuftlfy i said  that colour would

 	trj otu enough for a vaudeville star or
 -ourel boxer i reckon a blind man
 remember that car

thats right says tabor thats
dytfor now look stand away a bit

      -ith that he steps to her and round
 ligand flicks down cunningly rolled-up
 by f buttoning under her on studs ami
 dubtz in two tick she was a dun-
  csi old craft solemn enough to take
 hjj chief mourner to a funeral arrange-
 canvas covers it was that hooked
 you  vrr paint-work cute give

        word

you can get the idea says tabor
tart in and tells it me simple as

	os a house his brother was in a

gang working on a road-that road down
there-and likely to be on it quite a piece
of time wed rush that road in the scarlct
car-twice first time wed have a break-
down right alongside where the boy was
working and whisper him the word   next
time we come jump for it next day
wed come again breakdown again
young billd jump for it us off like hell
behind us stop in a few miles pull down
the covers on the car double on our tracks 
and while they were wiring all over the
country to hold up a flaming scarlet auto
amble the boy leisurely to safety in our
solemn old mourning coach

   by jove it was a scheme i said
 go on

   it sure was dandy and theres
not much more go on to go we ran it
slick i tuned that auto up a day or two till
i got to know her so i could run her blind-
fold into hell an out again then  fetched
her down here we ran round a bit so the
warders should get the idea of us-wealthy
tourist doing the moor in his swell red
streak then one day we let out down that
road young bill wed fixed with field-
glasses from this knoll here the convicts
were working about ten yards apart each
side the route opening up the drainage
ditching was the job warders pacing about
young bill fortunately working within
twenty yards of the head of the line if hed
been midway-they stretched a quarter
mile i daresay-wed have stood a risk of
some one jumping into the road in the
hullabaloo when we got ofi and getting
tangled up in the wheels and stopping us
as it was wc ran into the road from this
end-see  up towards those boulders-
and ran up through the two lines of the poor
devils-them all glad of an excuse to stop
their digging and have a stare and a scowl
or a grin ran up slow till we were close
upon young bill then i put the auto
almost on top of him and pulled up he
was on my side  saw his face go white
and red but he stood steady and rested on
his spade one foot in the ditch and one on
the roadside tabor stepped out and came
round my side against where young bill
stood opened the bonnet and put his
head in and tinkered a bit then he said
low and clear  to-morrow bill j ump
in the minute  shout got back alongside
me and wc pulled out and got away

   next day we fixed her ready a big fur
rug we lashed across to cover the back seat
so that a man sitting thero would only show
liis head above it on the seat was roomy
trousers shooting jacket and a big leather
coat that young bill could wriggle into


hutchinsons story magazine

   over his broad-arrow suit tabor got in
   behind this time plan of it was for him to
   step out alongside young bill and leave the
   door open and the side of the rug turned up so
   young billd make just one dive and be in the
   seat tabor was to walk round the front of
   the car camc to the seat alongside me as if for
   n spanner or such get his hand on the door
   and then shout  now and the two of em
   would jump for it tabor next me and vounn
   bill behind

     by darn i i felt like id got a cold fish
   down between my sliirt and my spine as we lit
   down that road to hit our passenger tabor
   was breathing through his nose so i could hear
   him above the engine it was snre jumpy
   work until we got something to jump for which
   was when we ro-startcd and the shouting and
   the shooting began

     i said  shooting  by gad  tho warders
   fired at you did they f 

      they sure did three of em were stand-
   ing with their carbines on that bit of an
   embankment right above young bills head and
   where we pulled up tabor slips out from be-
   hind according to programme leaves the door
   on the swing and comes steady round the front
   of the car young bill standing resting on his
   spade pretty much as hed been the day before

      then something switched in we hadnt
   figured on a warder above young bill bends
   over and sings out  two-forty  get on with
   your work there  standing staring  

      the shout staggered tabor a bit non-
   plussed him thats the word youd use eh 
   he stops and has a squint-inside uie bonnet
   to eollecthiiuself and to watch out of the back
   of his ejrt what young bill would do young
   bill took a wrong turn stead of making a
   show of getting on with his digging he re-
   mained as he was resting on his spade ready
   to jump at the shout tabor fetches round
   from the bonnet and comes to the door puts
   his fist on the handle and liis foot on the step
   and opens his mouth to shout

     by darn things got tight then the
  darn warder that had ung out to young bill
  sings out again  damn yon two-forty he
  sings out get on with it and as if their tongues
  had been pulled with the same string tabor
  chooses the very same moment to let fly

    now   he shouts an out of every second in
   the whole blamed year couldnt have chosen a
   worse one the warder with his  get on with
   it i  jumps down into the trench alongside
   young bill and just about hit the earth with
   tabors  now i 

him wlth 	drove

   the handle into the pit of his stomach good and
  hard and jumped for the car and in and i
  slipped home the clutch and by darn i the
  twenty seconds that auto took to pick up her
  stride taught me more about eternity than a
  churchful of bishops could explain in twenty
  years it sure did

   he paused as if to reflect again upon those
age-long moments while the car crawled into
 her speed thcn went on again

    shouts-hells own shouting-aud shots

 i took a squint round as she began to rip
 young bill sitting bolt upright dead pale datb

 jim his chin just above the hitchcd-up rug-

 he two warders on the embankment down o
 one knee letting fly and the one with tw
 stomach-ache stooping for hi gun
 ta theyre shooting to hit the tyres say

      theyre darn near hitting me  i says an
  one comes pee-whit between our darn heads afld
  slick through the windscreen in front of u
  by darn  we lit out after that bullet till 
  reckon we came mighty near catching it trust
  me for that i sure shook up that car vw
  were round a bend and greasing up the in
  and f think id never have stopped from 
  to now if tabor hadnt hollered to me a
  getting tho disguise covers down over
  paint-work so i stopped her and he m
  down and pulled the canvases over her

     hed practised that till ho could do it p
 wixteen seconds and i reckon he did it neartf
 six never stopped even for a word vriwj
 young bill i took a look at young bill whil
 we waited just got his chin above the ro 
 just like id first seen him i reckon he w
 frozen stiff with the strain and the reictio 
 dead pale still eyes half shut uttle bio
 bruise middle of his forehead where i reckon
 hed hit his head jumping in i gave him 
 gnn aud tabor sings out to him  get tho
 clothes on bui over your things on
 seat beside you and drops in next me and 
 ripped her oft again

    wed got the route figured oat pi
 another four miles and we swung left to doob
 back and let out all we knew at tho wf
 tabor put his hand on my arm  ill go
 hind now to bill he said  we re sale

 god  weve done it 

    and my narrator struck a match and put  -
 to his pipe  we were  he said  by darfl 
 we had

 i got out my own pipe  yes by jo

 word it was i say theres one thing thous-

 always just turns the scale inthese things of

  or the other sure the bit of t
 comes into the story right here it came io

 moment we got young bill aboard and pu
 away

- ah i how  	

 he inhaled a long breath from his pipe

wz	full of his lung	

   when tabor went round at the turn
join young bill behind he found him whtha
been from the start-stone dead

 i gave an exclamation

  yep that little blue bruise on hi

seemed that there had been a brilliant
blinding shaft of light upon one little
period of her life-and over all tho rest
just neutral tints of blue and grey blended

   at first she had minded terribly she
 could assign no reason for dicks sudden
 change of front and when a few months
 later he had married a girl he had known
 before ever he met ailsa it had been a
 great blow to her

   afterwards she buried her disappoint-
 ment deep in her own heart told no one
 about it and never went to the isle of
 wight again but in spite of all her efforts
 he seemed to command her senses and no
 other man found favour she took up
 work and led a busy active life and the
 old sore died away but still in the back-
 ground was a memory that would never
 die and dearly as she loved that beautiful
 corner of the sunny isle she returned no
 more twelve years passed bringing
 many changes and notably to her father
 an accession of wealth with which he had
 to change his name from thompson to
 foy so ailsa thompson became ailsa
 foy and found herself at thirty-four still
 unattached and with no necessity to work
 any more unless she chose and then the
 wave of colonial emigration caught her
 and tired of many things in the old world
 she decided to begin a fresh life in a new

   she became engaged to wilfred stam-
ford who was fanning in natal and who
was described by all his friends as a
 thundering good fellow finally ailsa
said her  good-byes  in i-ondon because
she preferred it and stood on the deck of
the liner slipping out to sea past the
needles taking a last farewell of a dream
that had been  passing sweet  while it
lasted   suppose i was lucky really
ran her thought  for if dick could be-
have like that he must have made a most
unsatisfactory husband and i should have
had a wearing difficult time with him
tie was always eccentric and though
cccentric men make charming companions
they are generally very difficult to live

with- but all the time that she

admonished herself thus she knew that
early love had had a freshness of abandon-
ment tlat was very beautiful whereas
this later one was very calm and prosaic
and practical to have a  thundering
good fellow  for a husband was per hap a
happy ending but she knew in her heart
there was a vague regret for that old care-
less rapture  that old unmeasured fresh-
ness of the diwn

 finally she turned away and paced the

 deck a little before going down to be
 cabin to unpack	

   when she entered the dining-saloon 
 little later she found most of the table
 were empty and evidently numbers o
 passengers preferred the privacy of t licit
 cabins the steward took her to a seafc
 at the captains table near the end at
 she sat down with empty seats all at
 her her nnme-card was propped agair
 her glass and she noticed listlessly tliat 
 her right hand was the name-card of
 well-known soldier and she felt glad
 be seated next to him

   it was not until she was half-way throt
 her soup that she noticed the card on hcf 
 left for the end seat and then sb
 dropped her spoon with something of
 clatter and stared at it moment
 transfixed while she read-richard
 frewen-st austin

   for a breathless moment it seemed a
 if the world stood still and everything
 it then she managed to get a grip aga
 and felt angry with herself for being mov
 at all of course it was dick
 there was only one r r frewen-st au
 and probably his wife would be taking t
 seat opposite to him-some travellers li
 the seats arranged thus  she tried to se
 the card but it had fallen on its face an
 she felt shy of reaching across for it
 with swift relief she remembered that
 all probability dick would not recognise
 her twelve years are a long time a
 different hair-dressings make a face un-
 familiar moreover the changed nab-
 would put him off the sccnt altogether an
 no doubt she could easily hide her ident
 with a little care and forethought

   but she hoped they would not come into
 dinner that evening while she had no one
 to speak to on her right and even whfl
 she hoped it a tall lean well-dressed jnat
 frewen-st austin himself entered tb
 saloon with a leisurely air and iiquif
 for his seat for a moment ailsa
 relieved for she believed that without tn i
 name-card she would not have recognise
 him he with a changed name to
 him would easily be kept unciilightcii
 she felt sure the old tale of the  double
 would serve well enough if necessary 

   as he came down the saloon she note
 the grey on his temples the clean-sha c
 mouth the leisurely stoop which were a
 new to her	

   apparenuy life had not been all sunshijv
 for him although he had snatched at
 thing he wanted careless ol who was
 and yet faintly she discerned that he

  gshe knew that he gave her a quick

 gered him lightly- apparently it is
 fashionable to be absent

 she observed a shade of puzzled hesita-

 itv struck a vague note of reminiscence

 tavd near tunbridge wells ailsa

had never guessed before that she could
act so well her voice betrayed no tremor

   really  then it must be the same
the ailsa thompson i knew lived near
tunbridge wells there was a pause
frewen-st austin seemed lost in thought
and ailsa felt a little overcome by the tact
that he should remember her with this
evident interest it set her pulses tingling
and for the moment she almost forgot that
she was angry with him she stole a
glance at his face on pretencc of looking
down the saloon and observed that besides
the greyness on the temples there were
fine lines of care about his eyes and mouth
undoubtedly life had gone none too
smoothly for him and yet on the surface
was the same imperturbable air with its
lurking humour though with a new hint
of strong traits controlled

  twelve years ago he had been an
esthetic realistic youth with a pronounced
artistic vein

  now he appeared a calm man of strong
character whose cstheticism had taken a
different turn

   she wondered a little how the change was
most noticeable in herself  for she too
had been full of headstrong enthusiasms
in those days and had grown out of them
into a more knowledgeable calm

  he appeared to be eating his dinner
methodically with his thoughts iar away
and she left him undisturbed until be anked
suddenly- is she married  

    is who married   with a little laugh
    ailsa thompson

   i think not-only engaged

    engaged     who to  

    a man in south africa

   oh well carelessly- hes a nice
long way off

   she felt herself change colour and turned
away raising her glass to hide her mo-
mentary confusion bnt as soon as she
could command her voice she said lightly-
 what difference does that moke  

   i dont know that it makes any
going on stolidly with his dinner

    are you going to south africa   she
inquired presently  or to madeira  

    why on earth should i go to madeira 
do i look an invalid  

   she was obliged to admit he looked far
from it

    ii it interests you im going to have
the most glorious draught of freedom a
man ever had in his life im going to
wallow in sunshine and dont-care-ness
no letters no bills no tiresome com-
panions no neighbours no appointment


hutchinsons story magazine

no telephone no plans no damn ties of any
sort or kind beyond the immediate obli-
gations of the law

  she coaid not help smiling twelve
years slipped away-it was the dick of old
then carelessly she remarked- you
dont appear to be a married man  such
joys are not for benedicts

    nor for bachelors they are for re-
leased prisoners

    prisoners      with curiosity

  yes prepare to be shocked my wife
died three months ago

   she caught her breath with a gulp for
a moment the saloon swam he seemed
to notice her sudden discomfort for he said
with kindly humour- an extra big wave
im afraid    she forced herself to
laugh

     i think ill choose the side of discretion
and retire-rising a litue unsteadily

    but it was valour to come he tols
her  and will carry the usual reward
-youll get better much quicker for having
had your dinner

   thcn she left him and passed down the
saloon to her cabin glad she had so good
an excuse to go

   under the best of circumstances a cabin
on an ocean liner is a confined space to
ailsa that night her cabin felt like a
tiny pigeon-hole with no exit-almost a
trap most certainly had she known be-
forehand she would not have chosen to
voyage to south africa with dick frewcn-
st austin and now there was no possible
means of escape she must even for
seventeen days sit next to him at meals
but she rallied herself firmly what
difference could it make  she took wil-
fred stamfords photograph into her hand
and gazed into his fine honest face the
action steadied her it was quite all right
frewen-st austin would make an enter-
taining meais-partner and perhaps in the
end he would even give her away at her
wedding as her oldest friend she went
to sleep comforted

   it was a whole week before he found out
ailsa played her part well avoiding him
inconspicuously and chatting to hcr
right-hand neighbour as much as possible
but she felt that dick was puzzled she
foresaw that very soon she would have to
resort to the subterfuge of the  double
it would have been easier if he had been
more changed but now she saw him
frequently he seemed to have slipped a
load of years off his shoulders and to be
the same unaccountable eccentric boy of

old and the old attraction was there io
force on the ship he was greatly run
after it would have been easy enot
to avoid him if he had not persistent 
sought her company and then at last 
he cornered her in his usual out-spoken 
way he remarked  now dont get up 
and go away just because i have come to j
talk to you any one would think you 
had a guilty conscience the way
avoid me to her dismay she blust
scarlet and felt suddenly covered with 
confusion

   by jove    i  he remarked slowly

 you have got a guilty conscience and
stared hard into her face

  she tried to laugh it off but he paid no 
attention

  it is time for your heat in the deck
quoits sheaid  they will be waiting
for you

  let them wait im going to get to
the bottom of this and after another 
close scrutiny- ah  i see now you are
not miss foy at all-you are ailsa tliomp j

son

  she opened her lips to prevaricate but w
cut hcr short  dont trouble to deny it-
im amazed ive been blind so long hj
got up  god  this is a funny business j
he said  id better go and play that
game of quoits to steady myself and be
went away and left her

   ailsa sat quite still staring at the sea
a long time she saw now where she had
made a mistake by attempting to hide
her identity she had tacitly admitted tha 
he mattered in her life it gave a wrong
impression she ought to have been quit
open and callous and not risked such 
situation as this she did not see hi j
again until dinner-time and then he con
tented himself with teasing her

   i suppose j-ou were going to argue 

	double-  he finished  but why tbi
mystery     was it a game     
she told him  yes -she thought tb
voyage would be boring and this uttw
harmless subterfuge would amuse her-
 of course it has she finished in 
sprightly fashion the last diner left tb
table as she said it and they were alob-
he looked full and deep into hcr eve

 rot     he said  you were afraid

   nonsense i she answered sharply b
the tell-tale colour mounted again and a
she beat a hasty retreat she knew that to
was smiling to himself	jg j

  after that he became neutral treat
her as an old friend chatted and laugh
frankly of the old days and was altogetw



t t
gertrude page

a rightful companion then one day
siting together on deck he spoke of bis
triage

 it was an awful failure he said
e almost hated each other within a few

months

 then why did you marry     
    from her almost against her will

 e looked at her with a curious expres-
sion

   it was your doing

  t mine    f how could it be 
y vour ouuook on life was so idealistic
u overdid it you inspired me beyond

reason

    what did i ever say to inspire you to
marry without love   she asked with
scorn

 a good many things about duty i
my wife before i knew you and
had been a girl-and-boy engagement
etwecn us i thought it was just that
d no more she thought differentfy
 ter i saw you that last time she wrote
passionate sort of love letter claiming
promise we met and i told her 
jjfd some one else  ailsa moved
jstlessly she had turned very pale

     felt he was watching her intentfy
 c aid it made no difference that
could not live without me and if i
fed her she would finish herself i was
yuug and a fool i listened the things
had said about ideals and loyalty and
jr that haunted me finally  married
r  he was silent for some mo-
ots and ailsa could not trust herself
	then suddenly he laughed

 was an awu failure   
ijj didnt really love me at all she
on wanted to be married because some-
had let her down hadly it was
lcr rvge- he laughed again
at tle sky-line  its really im-
you know-i cant help laughing
take a mans life and squeeze it dry
perhaps a womans as well-
nityp a puny revenge for outraged

aili dosed her eyes and fought to
a	her composure to her it seemed

tjjjhsdy her best years robbed of their
tyjrjgy- his fine possibilities warped and
fpled on and for such a motive i
now   

ljc lowe-er the lane had a turning    
of ilrd lutn saying jauntily  she died
crbsr three months ago-god rest

clmi a ust wt it all out she told him
v-  dont let it make you bitter

take tip your writing again go on as if
it had not happened

   yes with quiet significance  that
is what i mean to do blot it ail out as
if it had not happened

  she played with her work-bag nervously
and suddenly in quite a changed voice he
said  so you are going to marry- a man
farming in natal  stamford  think you
called him  

   yes wilfred stamford hes such a
fine fellow warmly i should like you
to meet him every one loves him

  is that why you are going to marry
him  

  she bit her up  i dont know what
you mean

   oh yes you do t    ailsa i mean
are you going to marry him becausc youre
just a bit of the  everyone  who loves him
because hes such a fine fellow  

   its a matter i dont care to discuss
with you she said coldly and moved
away he watched her quite placidly
but she felt that behind the calm exterior
he was smiling again

  the climax did not come until they were
two days from cape town all the time
she fought his influence steadily and all
the time he assumed a nonchalant air
teasing her one moment enlarging upon
his glorious bout of freedom the next
she did not know what was in his thoughts
she shrank from analysing her own she
remembered only that wilfred was such
a good fellow-they all loved him and
he would be waiting at durban to marry
her the day the ship arrived

  one moment she prayed it to go faster
another she could have prayed it to
stand still her eyes looked strained and
restless it needed all her will to appear
normally calm and happy

  and behind it all she felt that frewen-
st austin read her like a book he had
always done so love had given him
insight to know her through and through
of old what if it did still

  she avoided him more assiduously he
pretended not to notice and made himself
more attractive than ever at meals when
she was obliged to meet him

  and then all in a moment on that last
evening but one camc the hour that she
could not escape from a concert was in
progress and because of the heat of the
saloon she slipped out to the cool deserted
deck hoping none had observed but
almost immediately he followed herand
found her standing in a shadowy cdmer

forward leaning on the ships rad gazing
into the star-lit dark

   i was afraid it was too hot for you
he said with a tenderness in his voice that
thrilled her ungovernably he leaned be-
side her and their arms touched some
unknown force prevented her moving away
he was like a powerful magnet drawing-
drawing her

   after a short pulsing silence he spoke

   ailsa i let myself be guided by don
quixote motives once and i lost badly
 dont propose to do it again 

  she clutched at the rail hard why oh
why could she not walk resolutely away
and lock hereelf in her cabin

   you understand-dont you  

   you are going to have a glorious bout
of freedom she said a little hoarsely
 and it will help you to forget

   not alone boldly-  am going to
take you with me

   on no-no- thrusting out her hands

as if warding something off

   yes doggedly  i will not let you
escape me no one shall come between us
again

   you forget-i am engaged

   i dont do anything of the kind what
is an engagement without love    
she buried her face in hcr hands  and
you cant keep up the fiction of loving him
with me as if i didnt-know  youve
ben in my heart every hour since we
parted twelve years ago you belonged
there you were my one love how
could anv church ritual mako any difference
to that   he gave a low laugh  it
may have made maud and me man and
wife but it did not make us lovers god
does that without the help of the church
and now you cannot commit the crime
that i committed-if it was a crime
anyhow ive paid dearly enough with my

life a hell for nearly twelve years fi
not going to let you run the risk  can
help it if he is such a good man  he isn
your man and youre not his wonih
youve got to listen to your heart a
your heart is clamouring for me    isnt

his arm round her and drew her to iub-
far away sounded the strains of the cofl
cert a deserted deck stretched bebiw
them

  he kissed her and the whole world wa
blotted out-and all the starty world
above-and all the heaving waters rousts
they stood alone in ether while th
universe passed on

  no one noticed that when she we
ashore at cape town she took all

  posk v ho knew the widow lesueur
   ctarcd that she was quite in-
  vfe wpalie of the villainous and spiteful
  which landed poor josephine pal-
  w n the dock for theft this may or
  	be so citoyenne lesueur had

    jjtaidi leeing that she was well-to-
        in good odour with all the com-
        and sections that tyrannised over
        folk in a manner which recalled
          worst days of the old regime to
        jujvntagr of the latter moreover
        lesueur was a hue man with a

r

  h  ay with him with the women

a gky bivk moustache and
eyes since he was a true son
south  rather inclined to be quarrel-
he had very decided views on
ui  had achille you should hear
jtjowng the carmagnole   a ira  a
he les aristas a la lanterne i 
 lustily  it verily sent n thrill
ytuf n

 for destroying everything that
rw  the old order  title of course
 alatc vrnership of every sort and
 the live of all those who did not
him laud must t-long to the
all that grew on the land and
ucd under the earth or brought

out of the sea everything must belong
to the people  that was achille s creed
houses and iiclds and cattlc and trees and
women  oh  above all women i women
were the property of the nation

  that was the grand new crced which
had lately been propounded at achiucs
club-the cordeliers and everybody
knows that what the cordeliers discuss
to-day becomes law by decree of the
national assembly the day after to-morrow

  now there were many who averred that
achille lesueur became a devotee of that
creed only alter josephine palmier-his
mothers maid-of-all-work-disdained his
amorous advances josephine was pretty
and had the dainty appearan ec which in
these grand days of perfect equality pro-
claimed past sojourn in the house of a
whilom aristocrat

  as a menial probably bah  achille
whenever he tried to question jophine
about the past and received no satisfactory
answer would spit and jeer for be had a
wholesome contempt for all aristocrats and
bourgeois and capitalists and people of
all sorts who had more money than he
achille lesueur the only son of his mother
happened to have at tbe moment

  did i mention the fact that the widow
lesueur was very well-to-do  that she
owned an excellent little business for the

l
hutchinsons story magazine

sale of wines both wholesale and retail 
and that achules creed that everything
should belong to the people did not go to
tho length of allowing say hector and
alcibiade to help themselves to a stray
bottle or so of best roussillon which hap-
pened to be standing invitingly on his
mothers counter 

  how he explained this seeming discrep-
ancy in his profession of faith i do not
pretend to say perhaps he did not con-
sider it a discrepancy and drew a firm line
between the ownership of the people and
the dishonesty of individuals

  be that as it may achille lesueur had
made up his mind that he was in love with
josphine palmier and that ho would
honour her by asking her to become his wife

  she refused  refused categorically and
firmly gave as an excuse that she could
give him no love in return no love to
him achille with the flashing eyes the
long maternal purse and the irresistible
ways  it was unthinkable the wench
was shy ignorant stupid despite her airs
and graces of an out-at-elbows aristocrat
achille pci-severed in his suit enlisted his
mothers help who indeed could not
imagine how any girl in her five senses
could throw away such a splendid chance
josephine palmier had looked half-starved
when first she applied for the situation of
maid-of-all-work in the widow lesueurs
house  she had great purple rings under
her eyes and hands almost transparently
thin  her lips looked pinched with cold
and her hair was lank and lustreless

  now sho still looked pale and was not
over-plump but the citieness lesueur told
all her neighbours that the wench had a
voracious appetite very difficult to satisfy
and that in accordance with the national
decree he was being treated as a friend
of the house

  and now this wanton ingratitude jose-
phine palmier a waif out of the gutter
refusing the hand of achille-his mothers
only son-in marriage 

  all a  was the baggage perchancc an
aristocrat in disguise  one never knew
these days  half-starved aristocrats were
glad enough to share the bread of honest
citizens in any capacity  and it was a
well-known fact that the ci-devatu com-
tesse daurillac had been cook to citizen
lou vet before she was sent as a traitor
and a spy to the guillotine

ir

  achille was persistent and josephine
obstinate citoyenne veuve lesueur whilst

watching the growth of her sons
waxed exasperated

  then th crisis came

  achilles passion reached its
and the widow lesueurs anger no
knew bounds the baggage must
had any one ever seen such wanton w
ness  first to encourage achiues 
tions-oh yes  the whilom aristo had
the first made eyes at the rich and
some son of the house now no doubt
had some traitor waiting for her
where or even perhaps one of those a
able english spies who literally in
paris these days intriguing and su
traitors and seducing the daugh
honest patriots so as to point with
critical finger afterwards at the
immoral tendencies of this glorious r
tion

   oh no i citoyenne lesueur did not
matters

   take your rags and chattels with
my wench and go  

  and josephine tearful hu
anxious for the future of pauvre
who was quietly starving in a garret
her daughter earned a precarious li
for both as a household drudge put t
her few tiny possessions-mere relic j
former happy times-and went out of
citoyenne lesueurs inhopitable
followed by the latters curses and
achille having been got safely out of t
way for the occasion

this had occurred in the late aft
the th floral which corresponds
the th day of april of more
calendars

  on the morning of the th-which 
saturday-citoyenne lesueur came 
stairs to the shop as usual a uttle aft 
took down the shutters and started
the place tidy for the days work
chancing to look on the drawer which
tained the takings of the week she s

with hands trembling with anxictjvi
worthy widow fumbled for her ky

 suggested that the

 pjght any ol its members might be

	ti iuk and the rue

enfers was always a very dark street the
citizen commissary concluded indulgently

  achille was beside himself with rage
imagine his word being doubted  what
was this glorious revolution coming to he
desired to know  in the end he vowed
that josephine palmier was both a thief
and an aristocrat but that he-achille
lesueur-the most soulful and selfless
patriot the republic had ever known was
ready to exercise the rights conferred upon
him by the recent decree of the national
convention and take the wench for wife
whereupon she would automatically become
his property and as the property of the
aforesaid soulful and selfless patriot be no
longer amenable to the guillotine

  achille had inherited that commiserating
heart from his mother apparently  and the
chief commissary of the section-himself a
humane and a just man if somewhat weak
-greatly approved of this solution to his
difficulties between ourselves he did not
believe very firmly in josephines guilt but
would not have dared to dismiss her with-
out sending her before the tribunal lest
this indulgence on his part be construed
into trafficking with aristos

ill

  all then would have been well but that
josephine palmier from tbe depths of the
prison where she had been incarcerated for
three days absolutely refused to be a party
to this accommodating arrangement

  she refused to be white-washed by the
amorous hands of achille lesueur declared
that she was innocent and the victim ol an
abominable conspiracy hatched by mother
and son in order to inveigle her into a hated
marriage

  thus the matter became very serious
from a mere question of theft the charge
had grown into one of false accusation of
conspiracy against two well-known and
highly-respected citizens the citizen
chief commissary scratched his head in
uttermost perplexity the trouble was
that he did not believe that the accusation
was a false one in hi own mind he was
quite certain that the widow and her
precious son had adopted this abominable
means of bringing the recalcitrant girl to
the arms of a hated lover

  but name of a narde  what is a com-
missary to do  being a wise man citizen
commissary bourgoin referred the whole
matter to a higher authority in other
words he sent the prisoner to be tried by
the revolutionary tribunal the tribunaj

extraordinaire where five judges and a
standing jury would pronounce whether
josephine palmier was a traitor an aristo
as well as a thief and one who has trafficked
with english spies for the destruction of the
republic

  and here the unfortunate girl is presently
arraigned charged with a multiplicity of
crimes any one of which will inevitably
lead her to the guillotine

  citizen fouquier-tinville the attorney-
general has the case in hand citizen
dumas the judge-president fixes the
accused with his pale tlireatening eye
the narrow court is crowded to the ceiling 
somehow the affair has excited public
interest and achille lesueur and his
widowed mother being well-to-do sellers
of good wine have many friends

  attorney-general fouquier-tinville has
read the indictment the accused stands
in the dock facing the five judges with a
set determined look  her face she
wears a plain grey frock with long narrow
sleeves down to her pale white hands which
accentuate the slimness of her appearance
the white kerchief round her shoulders and
the cap which conceals her fair hair are 
spotlessly clean maman has carefully
washed and ironed them herself and brought
them to josephine in the prison so that
the child should look neat before her
judges

   accused what answer do you give to
the indictment   the judge-president
questions sternly

    i am innocent the girl replies firmly

 i was not in the rue des enfers at the
hour when yonder false witness declares
that he spoke with me

  achille who sits on a bench immediately
below the jury devours the girl with his
eyes every now and again he sighs and
his red spatulated hands are clasped con-
vulsively together at josephines last
words spoken in a tone of unutterable con-
tempt a crimson flush spreads over his face
and his teeth-white and sharp as those of
some wild feline creature-bury themselves
in his heshy lower lip his mother who
sits beside him demure and consequential
in sober black with open-work mittens on
her thin wrinkled hands gives achille a
warning look and a scarce-perceptible
nudge it were not wise to betray before
these judges feelings of which they might
disapprove

   i am innocent i  the girl insets  
do not know why the citixeoesa lesueur
should try to fasten such an abominable
crime on me

  here the attorney-general takes
sharply

   the citizeness lesueur cann
accused of trying to make you out a
since her only son is prepared to ma
his wife

   i would rather die accused of the
crimes known upon this earth she r
firmly  than wed a miserable liir
former

  achille utters a cry of rage not
that of a wild beast again his
has to restrain him but the pu
sympathy with him imagine that
aristo scorning the love of so fine a

  the attorney-general is waxing
patient

   if you arc innocent he says
 prove it the revolutionary
mittee of your section has declared
be a suspect and ordered your arr
as such tbe onus to prove your in
now rests with you

   at ten oclock on the night of t
floral i was with my mother t

who saw you and can swear that yo
not possibly have been at the

  but this time the girl is dumb
sensitive lips are drawu closely tc 
if they would guard a secret which
remain inviolate

   well   the attorney-general

hutchinsons story magazine

   you say that the principal witness
could not have seen you in the rue des
enters at ten oclock of the th florial
because at that hour you were in the rue
christine well i prove it

  and every one of them hath received the
same mute answer  an obstinate silence
the sight of a face pale and drawn and a
glance from large purple-riramed eyes that
have a haunting terrified look in them now

  in the end the judge-president sums up
the case and orders the jury to  get them-
selves convinced and this they must do
by deliberating and voting audibly in full
hearing of the public for such is the law
to-day

  for awhile thereupon nothing is heard in
the court save that audible murmur from
the stand where the jury are getting
themselves convinced  the murmur it-
self is confused  only from time to time a
word a broken phrase penetrates to the ear
of the public or to that of the unfortunate
girl who is awaiting her doom such
words as  obvious guilt or  no doubt a
traitor  naught but an aristo  the
guillotine occur most frequently  especi-
ally  the guillotine   it is such a simple
solver of problems such an easy way to set
all doubts at rest

  the accused stands in the dock facing
the judges  she does not glance once in the
direction of the jury she seems like a
statue fashioned of alabaster a ghostlike
harmony in grey and white her kerchief
scarce whiter than her checks

  then suddenly there is a sensation
through tho hum of the jury  debating
audibly a raucous voice is raised from
out the body of the public immediately
behind the dock

   name of a dog  why cyrano lodges
at no  rue christine he was there on
the evening of the th eh cyrano  en
avant raon ancient 

   cyrano cn avant   the chorus ir
taken up by several men in ragged shuts and
blouses to the accompaniment of ribald
laughter and one or two coarse jokes

  the jury cease their  audible  delibera-
tion remember that this tribunal ex-
traordinaire is subject to no law-forms
judges and jury arc here to administer
justice as they understand it not as tradi-
tion-the hatred traditions of the old
regime-bad it in the past they are here
principally in order to see that the republic
suffers no detriment through the actions
of her citizens and there is no one to
interfere with them as to how they accom-
plish this laudable end

il

  this time all of them being purzled
the strangeness of tho atlair-the sin
dearth of witnesses in such a comph
case-they listen to the voice of the pu
vox populi suits their purpose for
nonce

   so	at an order from the judge-presi
someone is hauled out of the crowd pi
forward into the witness-box hustled
bundled like a bale of goods a gr
hulking fellow with muscular arms

he draws his hand slowly across his

which sits quaintly on one so power

he says in a gentle indulgent voice
ing the judge-president  because of 
nose it seems there was once a

citizen of france called cyrano who
very large nose and 

never mind about that the jj

president breaks in impatiently
what you know

replies with a doleful sigh   the cornf
they will have their little game

  apparently the document is all o

affair that is not enough the law
cannot accept the word of all and sundry
who may wish to help in its administration
however well-intentioned they may be 
and it is the work of the committee of
public safety to find such traitors and
aristos as are a danger to the state you
and your comradcs are not competent to
deal with so serious a matter

   not competent citizen judge  
georges gradin queries meekly  then i
pray you look at the accused and see if we
arc not competent to find the aristo whom
she is trying to shield

   he gave a short dry laugh and pointed a
long stained finger at the unfortunate girl
in the dock all eyes were immediately
turned to her indeed it required no deep
knowledge of psychology to interpret
accurately the look of horror and oi genuine
fear which literally distorted josephine
palmiers pale emaciated face and now
when she saw the eyes of the five judges
fixed sternly upon her a hoarse cry escaped
her trembling ups

    it is false   she cried and clung to
the bar of the dock with both hands as if
she were about to fall  the man is
lying i no one camc that evening to
mamans lodgings  there was no one there
but marnan and i

   give me and the comrades till to-
morrow citizen judge gradin interposed
meekly  and well have the aristo here to
prove who it is that is lying now  

   the moniieur of the ioth flo rial year i
which gives a detailed account of that
memorable sitting of the tnbtmal extra-
ordinaire tells us that after this episode
there was a good deal of confusion in
the court the jury once more ordered
by the judges to deliberate and to vote
audibly decided that the principal witness
on behalf of the accused must appear before
the couit on the morrow at throe oclock of
the afternoon failing which josephine
palmier would be convicted of perjury and
conspiracy directed against the persons of
citizeness veuve lesueur and her son
achille a crime which entailed the dcath-
sentence

  gradin stepped down from the witness-
box a hero before the public lie was soon
surrounded by his friends and led away in
triumph

   as for achille and his mother they had
listened to georges gradins evidence with
derision rather than with wrath  no doubt
they felt that whichever way the affair
turned now they would have ample revenge


hutchinsons story magazine

for all the disdain which they had suffered
at the hands of the unfortunate josephine

  the moniteur concludes its account of
the episode by the bald statement that the
accused was taken back to the cells in a
state of unconsciousness

  the public was on tenterhooks about the
whole affair the latter had the inestim-
able charm which pertains to the unusual
here was something new  something differ-
ent from theuuual tableau of the bourgeois or
tho aristocrat arraigned for spying or mal-
practices against the safety of the republic
from the usual proud speech from the
accused defying the j udges who condemned 
from the usual brief indictmeut and swift
sentence followed by the daily spectacle
of the tumbril dragging a few more victims
to the guillotine

  here there was mystery a secret
jealously guarded by the accused who
apparently preferred to risk her neck rather
than drag some unknown individual-an
aristo evidently and her lover-before the
tribunal even in the mere capacity of
witness

  the court was crowdcd on this second
day of josephines trial with working-men
anil shopmen with women and some
children a sight what  this girl half
aristocrat half maid-of-all-work  and the
handsome achille  how would he take the
whole affair  he had been madly in love
with the accused so they say

  aud would cyrano producc the prin-
cipal witness he had promised he would do 
a fine fellow that cyrano and hater of
aristos  name of a name how he hated
them i

  the court was crowded the judges
waiting the accused more composed
than yesterday stands in the dock grasping
the rail with her thin white hands her
whole slender body slightly bent forward
as if in an attitude of tense- expectancy

  anon georges gradin appears upon the
scene is greeted with loud guffaws and calls
of  vivat cyrano   he is pushed along
jostled bundled forward till he finds him-
self once more in the witness-box confront-

 the sudden shock of surprise gradin with
 three strides of his long legs is over the bar
 of the dock  in the dock itself the next
 moment and has seized josephine palmier
 and thrown her across his broad shoulders
 as if she were a bale of goods

   to clinch the bargain he imprints a
 smacking kiss upon her cheek josephine
 palmiers head rolls almost inert upon hot
 shoulders white and death-like save for
 the crimson glow on one side of her face
 there where her conquering captor has set
 his seal of possession

   gradin gives a long coarse laugh 

    she does not care for me it seems he
 says in his usual self-deprecating way

  but it will come  

   the comrades laugh  vivat cyrano  
 and they close in around their friend who
 once more with one stride of his long limbs
 is over the bar of the flock at the back of it
 this time and is at once surrounded by a
 yelling gesticulating crowd

   there is indescribable confusion vainly
 does the attorney-general shout himseu
 hoarse vainly does the judgc-prcsident
 rap with a wooden mallet against his desk
 every one shouts every one gesticulates
 most people laugh such a droll fellow
 that cyrano with his big nose there he is
 just by the doorway now still surrounded
 by  the comrades  but his huge frame
 towers above the crowd and across his
 broad shoulder still slung like a bale of
 goods lies the unconscious body of jose-
 phine palmier

   in the doorway he turns his glance
 sweeps over the court above the massed
 heads of t he throng

   and if you want me at auy time
 citizen judge he calls out in a ringing
 voice which has no sound of timidity or
 meekness in it now  you know where to
 find me-the scarlet pimpernel at your 
 service i 

   with this he flings something white and
 weighty across the court it lands on the
 desk of the judgc-presidcnt then using
 the inert body of the girl as a battering-ram
 wherewith to forge liimself a way through
 the fringe of the crowd he begins to move
 his strength his swiftness above all hi
 audacity and total unconsciousness of
 danger carry him through in less than
 ten seconds he has scattered the crowd and
 has gained ten paces on the foremost

scrawled over with a doggerel rhyme and a
signature done in rad--just a small five-

  but with every second the pseudo-gradin
has forged ahead striding with long limbs
that know neither hesitation nor slackness
he knows his way about this palace of
justice as no one else does probably in the
whole of paris in and out of corridors
through guarded doors and down winding
stairs he goes with an easy-swinging stride
never breaking into a ruu to those who
stare at him with astonishment or who
try to stop him he merely shouts over his
shoulder

that was not driven to meet at  the
love-a-duck but the biggest thing in
tibbelsford was the voice of the landlord
at night amidst the glittering taps and
tankards he would  preside by this
you must understand that the word be
taken literally he was no ordinary pot-
man to hand mugs of ale across the bar to
thirsty carters or nips of gin to thin-
lipped clerks

  he would not appear till the evening
was well advanced and then he woukl
stroll in and lean against the bar his sleepy
eyes adjusting the various phenomena of
his perspective to a comfortable focus

  and then the old cronies and characters oi
tibbelsford would touch their hat and say 
 evening mr wright 

  and he would nod gravely like an
emperor receiving the fealty of his serfs
and a stranger might whisper

   who is this fat old guy  

  and the answer would be  hsh   for
the eyes of mr seldom right missed no-
thing bumptious strangers were treated
with complete indifference if they ad-
dressed him he looked right through them
and breathed heavily but for the cronies
and characters there was a finely adjusted
scale of treatment a subtle under-current
of masonry to get into favour with mr
seldom right one had to work ones way
up and any bad mistake would land one
back among the strangers in which case
one would be served fairlv and squarely
but there the matter would end for it
should be stated at this point that every-
thing about  the love-a-duck  was good
in quality and lavish in quantity and the


hutchinsons story magazine

rooms in spite of their great size were
always spotlessly clean having carefully
considered the relative values of this human
panorama the landlord would single one
some individual fortunate enough to catch
his momentary favour and in a voice
w hich seemed to make the glasses tremble
and the little chelsea figures on the high
tnantcl-shelf gasp with surprise he would
exclaim 

   well mr tnpsmith and how are wc 
light on the lop o life  full of beaus
hone blood and benevolence eh  ha
ha ha  

  nd the laugh would clatter among the

	ankards twist the gas-bracket go rolling
down the corridors and make the dogs
bark in the kennels beyond the stables

  and mr topsmith would naturally
blush and spill his beer and say 

   oh thank you sir nothin to grumble
about  pretty good goui altogether

   thats right  thats right  

  there were plenty of waitresses and
attendants at  the love-a-duck but
however busy the bars might be the land-
lord himself always dined at seven-thirty
precisely with his wife and daughter in
the oblong parlour at the back of the saloon
bar and they dined simply and pro-
digiously a large steaming leg of mutton
would bl- carried in and in twenty minutes
time would return a forlorn white frag-
ment of bone great dishes of fried
potatoes cabbages and marrow would all
vanish  stilton cheese would come
back like an over-explored ruin of some
ancient assyrian town and mine host
would mellow these simple delicacies with
three or four tankards of old ale occasion-
ally some of the cronies and characters
were invited to join the repast but whoever
was there the shouts and laughter of the
landlord rang out above everything only
seconded by the breezy giggles of mrs
wright whose voice would be constantly
heard exclaiming   oh jim you are a
fule  

  it was when the dinner was finished that
the landlord merged into the president
he produced a long churchwarden and
ambled hither and thither with a pompous
benevolent consciously proprietary- air
the somewhat stilted formality of his first
appearance expanded into a genial but
autocratic courtliness he was an ed-
wardian of edward ians he coukl be
surprisingly gracious tactful and charm-
ing and he also had that hanoverian
faculty of seeing right through one-a
perfectly cruslung manneriira

  by slow degrees he would gently s
herd his favourite llock around the fire j
the large bar parlour decorated with st
heads pewter and old chelsea then
would settle himself in the corner of
ingle-nook by the right side of the
ivrhaps at this time i may be auwedi
enumerate a few of the unbreakable ru
which the novice had to learn by deg
they were as follows 

  you must always address the landlord m
 sir	e

  you must never interrupt him in uw
course of a story

  yon must never appear to disbelieve hu
you must never tell a bigger lie than 
has just told

  if he offers you a drink you must a

it

  you must never under any circumsta
offer to stand him a drink in return

  you may ask his opinion about anyt
but never any question about his pc
affairs

  you may disagree with him bnt v
mast not let him think that youre
taking him seriously

 you must not get drunk	ja

  these were the broad abstract  j
there were other by-laws and coveoflh
allowing for variable degrees of inter 
tion that for instance which gvetnei
the improper story a story could
suggestive but must never be
vulgar or profane abo one might bjgl
had enough to drink to make one gmflww
but not enough to be boisterous or	

lin or even over-familiar	gj

  i have stated that the quality of

  it cannot be said that the general
standard of intelligence reached a very high
level and against it it was difficult to tell
quite how intelligent the landlord was
if he was not n well-educated man he
certainly had more than a veneer of
education in an argument he was seldom
extended sometimes he talked brilliantly
for a moment and then seemed to talk out
of his hat he had an extravagant thea-
trical way of suddenly declaiming a state-
ment and then sinking his voice and
repeating it sometimes lie would i
moodish and not talk at all but at his
best he was very good company

  it would be idle to pretend that the
frequenters of the bar believed the land-
lords stories on the conti ary im afraid
wc were a very sceptical lot most of us
had nevei been farther than london or
the sea-side and our imagination shied at
episodes in rajahs palaces and receptions
in spanish courts it became a byword
in the town   have you beard old seldom
rights latest nevertheless he was
extremely populai at the time ol which
i write the landlord must have been well
over sixty yeais ol age and his wife was
possibly forty-five iticy appeared to be
an extieinely happy and united family

  and then septimus stourway appeared
on the scene he was an acid angular
middle-aged man with sharp features a
heavy black moustache and eyes too close
together he was a chartered accountant
and he came to the town to audit the books
of a large brewery near-by and one or two
other concerns he brought his wife and
his son who was eleven years old he was
a man whom everybody disliked from the
very beginning and never got over it he
was probably clever at his job quick-think-
ing self-opinionative aggressively assert-
ive and altogether objectionable

  the very first occasion on which he
visited  the love-a-duck  he btoke every
rule of the masonic ring except the one
which concerned getting drunk the com-
pany was in session under its president
and he bounced into the circle and joined
in the conversation he interrupted the
landlord in the middle of a story and
plainly hinted that he didnt believe him
he called liim  old chap  and offered to
stand him a drink he then told a long
boring story about some obscure episode ui
his own life the eflect of this intrusion
was that the landlord who never replied
to him at all rose heavily from his scat and
disappeared the rest of the com par
tried to show by their chilling i


hutchinsons story magazine

ncsb that they disapproved of him bui
mr stour way was not the kind of person
to be sensitive to this he ratued on
occasionally taking tiny sips of his brandy-
and-water he even had the audacity to
ask old hargreaves who the fat disagree-
able old butter was  and poor old har-
greaves was so upset he nearly cried he
could only murmur feebly  hes the
landlord

   liin  a nice sort of landlord  sow i
knew a landlord at-

  the company gradually melted away and
left the stranger to sip his brandy-and-
water alone

  everybody hoped of course that this
first visit would also be the last but oh
no i the next evening at the same time in
bounced mr septimus stourway quite
uncrushed again the landlord disap-
peared and the company melted away
the third night some of them tried snubbing
him and being rude but it had no effect at
all at every attempt of this sort he merely
laughed in his empty way and exclaimed 

   my dear fellow just listen to me-

  before a week was out mr septimus
stourway began to get on the nerves of th
town me swaggered about the streets as
though he was doing us a great honour by
being there at all his wife and son were
also seen his wife was a tali vinegary-
lookiiir woman in a semi-fashionable semi-
sporting get-up she wore a mouocle and
a short skirt and carried a cane the boy
was a spectacled round-shouldered un-
attractive-looking youth more like the
mother than the father in appearance
he never seemed to leave his mothers side
for an instant

  it appeared that his name was nick
and that he was the most remarkable boy
for his age who had ever lived he knew
latin and greek and french and history
and mathematics and philosophy and
science also he had a beautiful nature
mr stourway spent hours boring any one
he could get to listen with the narration of
his sons marvellous attributes if the
habitu of  the love-a-duck  tired of
mr stourway they became thoroughly fed
up with his son

  it was on tbe following wednesday even-
ing that the dramatic incident happened in
the bar-parlour of the famous inn the
landlord had continued his attitude of
utter indifference to the interloper he
had been just as cheerful and entertaining 
only when mr stow way entered the bar
he simply dried up but during the last
two days he appeared to be thinking ab-

stractedly about something he was an j
noyed	

  on this wednesday evening the ufu
company had again assembled and th
landlord appeared anxious to resume lu
former position of genial host when lfl
came mr stourway again he had no
been in tho previous evening and cvery oflji
was hoping that at last he had realise i
that be was not wanted up rose
landlord at once and went away	

was an almost uncontrolled groan from to
rest mr stourway took his scat a
began to talk affably	jk

   it was thcn observed that the landlord 
instead of going right away was hoverio
about behind the bar i dont know ba 
the conversation got round to poetry
after a time mr stourway started	i

about his sons marvellous memory
poetry	j

    that boy of mine you know  he sa

 he would simply astound you he i
members everything the poetry he j
learnt off by heart  miles and miles of

age in the country who coukl quote half
much	j

  it was thcn uie bomb-shell fell  j

suddenly his enormous voice rang oat jj

  there was a dead silence and e verytw

 k boy about his own aflairs could a

 tpeat more poetry-twice as much more 
 tan this phenomenal nick siourway 
 now was it all to be arranged

 became evident however that the
 fdlord was very much in earnest he
 tj apparently thought out all the details
  should be an open competition it
 rj take place in the ball-room ol the
 the two boys should stand on the
 tform with their parents and should
 poems or blank verse in turn a
 committee of judges should count the

 he soon became eager it was the

 boy might be clever and have a good

 morv  but that he could possibly rccite
  a much as the wonderful nick was

 he hated the landlord he knew that

 at  the lovc-a-duck but at all
 i ttrjwhere men met and talked it can-
 h denied that a considerable number
 were made seldom rights tre-
 optimum found him many sup-
 but the great odds and the fact
  nvariably lost in wagris of this
 ss-- many into the opposing camp of

 potomitt- of wavs and means was
  jew the following nujht after mrs
 stourway h--d given her consent
 tc had signified his willingness to
 histrionic abilities to a crowd of

 old

 hrgrear mr bean and a school-

 master named mcfarlane were appointed
 the judges the ball-room was to be open
 to any one and there was to be no charge
 for admission the date of the com-
 petition was fixed for the following satur-
 day afternoon at five oclock

  i must now apologise for intruding my
own personality into this narrative i
would rather not do so but it is inevitable
it is true my part in the proceedings was
only that of a spectator but from your
point of view-and from mine-it was an
exceedingly important part  must begin
with the obvious confession that i had
visited  the love-a-duck  on occasions
and that is the kind of adventure that one
naturally doesnt make too much of
nevertheless i can say with a clear con-
science that i was not one of the inner
ring i had so far only made the most
tentativo efforts to get into the good graces
of the landlord but everyone in tibbejs-
ford was talking of the forthcoming remark-
able competition and i naturally made a
point of turning up in good time

  i managed to get a seat in the fourth
row and i was very fortunate for the
ball-room was packed and a more remark-
able competition i have never attended
the three judges sat in the front row
facing the platform the stourway party
occupied the right side of the platform and
the wrights the left the landlord sat
with his party but in the centre so that
he could act as a kind of chairman he
appeared to be in high good-humour and
he came on first and made a few facetious
remarks before the performance began
in the first place he apologised for the
lighting if was certainly very bad
there originally had been footlights but
it was so longsince they had been used
that the y were out of repair the large room
was only lighted by a gas chandelier in
the centre so that the stage was bomcwhat
dim but as he explained this would only
help to obscure the blushes of the per-
formers when they received the plaudits of
such a distinguished gathering

  the stourway party entered first they
came in from a door at the back of the
platform mr stourway noisily non-
chalant talking to every one at random
in a tail-coat with grey spats  his wife in
a sports skirt and a small hat looking
rather bored and disgusted  and the boy
in an eton jacket and collar with a bunchy
tic and his hair neatly brushed- he looked
very much at home and confident it was
obvious that he was out to enjoy himself
numerous prixc-distributions at which he


hutchinsons story magazine

  had played a conspicuous part had evi-
  dently inured him to such an ordeal

    and then the other party entered and
  the proceedings seemed likely to end before
  they had begun mrs wright came on
  first followed by t lady dressed in black
  leading a most diminutive boy they only
  reached the door when apparently the sight
  of this large audience frightened the small
  person and he began to cry tht- landlord
  and his wife rushed up and with the mother
  tried to encourage him and after a few
  minutes they succceded in doing so the
  lady in black however-who was pre-
  sumably the widowed mother-picked him
  up and carried him in and sat him on her
  kuee

    the audience became keenly cxcited and
  every one was laughing and discussing
  whether the affair would materialise or not
  at length things seemed to be arranged and
  the landlord came forward and said 

    ladies and gentlemen allow me to
  introduce you to the competitors-master
  nick stourway master stephen wright
  good gracious  it sounds as though i were
   announcing tho competitors in a prize-
  ring but this is to be a very peaceful
  competition-at least i hope so  i think
  you all know the particulars were
  simply going to enjoy ourselves arent we
  nick  arent we stephen  

    nick smiled indulgently and said  yes
  sir

    stephen glanced up at him for a second
  and then buried his face in his mothers lap

     well well said the landlord  i will
  now call  master nick to open the ball

    master nick was nothing loath he stood
  up and bowed  and holding his right arm
  stiffly and twiddling a button of his waist-
  coat with his left he declaimed in ringing
  tones

    u was the schooner  hesperus 

       that sailed the wintry sea 

    and the skipper had taken his liltle
    daughter
    to bear hint company

    there were twenty-two verses of this of
  four lines each and the audicnce were
  somewhat impatient because they had
  not come there to hear master nick recite
  they had come for the competition and it
  was still an open question whether there
  would  any competition they were
  anxiously watching master stephen he
  spent most of the period of his rivals
  recitation of this long poem with his face
  buried in his mothers lap in the dark

corner of the platform his motl
stroked his hair aud kept on whispering 
word to him and occasionally he woum
peer round at nick and watch him for a i
seconds  then he glanced at the andieflm
and immediately ducked out of sight agaith
when nick had finished he bowed and
sat down and there was a mild rouji
of applause the judges consulted and
agreed that he had scorcd  lines

  now what was going to happen 

  the small boy seemed to be shaking bpi
head and stamping his feet and his mo
was talking to him the landlord cou

he was obviously a little nervous 
went over to the group and said in a chccf
ful voice

   now stephen tell us a poem s
a little piping voice said  no i 
there were all the wriggles and shakes - 
the recalcitrant youngster murmurs
round the room and a lot of people wc
laughmg the stourway party srtf cj
tremely amused at length the landl
took a chair near him and produced a k
suck of barley-sugar

   now stephen he said  if you wo
talk to these naughty people tell m
poem tell me that beautiful  hymn w
apollo  you told me last winter j
the little boy looked up at him
grinned  then he looked at iiu mtdj
her widows veil covered the upper pa 
her face she kissed him and said 

   go on dear tell uncle jtm  

  there was a pause the small
looked up ami down and then hxinf 
eyes solemnly on the landlords face-
suddenly began in a queer litue lispjj
voice

      cod of the golden bow

  a nd of the golden lyre

       a nd of the golden hair
          a nd of the golden fire 

              charioteer
         hound the patient year  

  where-where slept thine ire

  it was a short poem but its render
received with vociferous
was going to be a competition

people who had money at stak-ie
laughing and slapping their legs
who hadnt were doing the ane
one was on the best of terms	d

other there was a certain
trouble with the judges as thy
know the poem and they didnt k
length of the line fortunt-
schoolmaster had come armed
stacy aumonier

     alter some discussion the poem was
 und to have been written by keats and
  aslcr stephen was awarded  lines
 j wua cheered clappcd and kissed by the
 landlord and his aunt and his mother
 u master nicks reply to this was to recite
 the pied piper of hamclin a perform-
 ance which bored everyone to tears especi-
 ally as he would persist in gesticulating
 l doing it in a manner as though he
 l thought that tlie people had simply come
 to hear his performance  the pied piper
 f hamelin  is  lines thus made his
 tore s

   the small boy was still very shy and
  seemed disinclined to continue but the
 landlord said 

    now come on stephen im sure you
 retneniber some more beautiful poetry

    at last to every ones surprise he began
 to lisp

   once more unto the breach dear friends
        once more 

 j it was screamingly funny he went
 j pght through the speech and when he got
 o

  cry  god for harry england and saint
       george i  

 the applause was deafening people were
 juing out and some of the barrackers had
  be rebuked by the landlord king
 inrys speech was only  lines so master
 pjtephcns totalwas  nick then re-
 taliated with an appalling poem which
 join menccd

 g  she stood at the bar of jntice

       a creature wan and wild

      in form loo intall for a woman

        in feature too old for a child

 	t was not quite  long as

 bp other two and only brought him 
 es making a total of j
 ttephet who seemed to be gaining a
 tle more confidence and entrrtng into the
 hgirit of the thing replied with rolx-rt
 fijrikki ole to a datludil a charm-
 little effort although it only brought
   lines	

 i master nick ncm broke into shakespeare
      let himself go on 

   friends remans countrymen lend me
       your ears 

    he only did  lines however before he

broke down and forgot the committee
had arranged for this it was agreed that
in the event of either competitor breaking
down he should still score the lines up to
where he broke down and at the end he
should be allowed to quote odd lines pro-
vided there were more than one

  at this point there was a very amusing
incident master stephen hesitated for
some time and then he began  friends
romans countrymcn etc  and he went
right through the same speech without a
slip i it was the first distinct score for
the landlords party and master stephen
was credited with  lines the scores
however were still  to  in nicks
favour and he proceeded to pile on the
agony by reciting  beth gelert how-
ever at the end of the twelfth verse he
again forgot and only amassed  lines

  balanced against his mothers knee and
looking unutterably solemn-as far as one
could see in the dim light-and only oc-
casionally glancing at the audience stephen
then recited a charming poem by william
blake called  night which also con-
tained  lines

  nick then collected  lines with  some-
bodys darling and as a contrast to this
sentimental twaddle stephen attempted
wordsworths  ode on intimations of
immortality unfortunately it was his
turn to break down but not till he had
notched  lines it was quite a feature
of the afternoon that whereas nicks con-
tributions for the most part were the
utmost trash stephen only did good things

  it would perhaps be tedious to chronicle
the full details of the poems attempted and
the exact number of lines scored although
as a matter of fact at the time  did keep a
careful record but on that afternoon it
did not appear tedious except when nick
let himself go rather freely over some quite
commonplace verse even then there was
always the excitement as to whether be
would break down the audience indeed
found it thrilling and it became more
and more exciting as it weut on for it
becamc apparent that both boys were
getting to the end of their tether they
both began to forget and the judges were
kept very busy and the parents were as
occupied as seconds in a prire-ring it
mnst have been nearly half-past six when
master nick eventually gave out he
started odds and ends and forgot and bis
parents were pulled up for prompting he
collccted a few odd lines and amassed a
total of  a very considerable amount
for a boy of his age
 hutchinsons story magazine

  at this point he was leading by 
lines so for stephen to win tbe wager
for the landlord he would not only have
to score that odd  but he would have
to remember an additional  lines  and
he already gave evidence of forgetting 
there was a fresh burst of betting in odd
parts of the hall and dick toom was offer-
ing ten to one against the landlords roteg
and not getting many takers the great
thing in his favour was that he seemed to
have quite lost his nervousness he was
keen on the job and he seemed to realise
that it was a competition and that he had
got to do his utmost the landlords party
were allowed to talk to him and to make
suggestions but not to prompt if he for-
got there was a short interval in which
milk and other drinks were handed round
the landlord had one of the other drinks
and then he said 

    ladies and gentlemen im going to
ask your indulgence to be as quiet as
possible my small nephew has to recall
 lines to win the competition and he is
going to try and do it

  the announcement was received with
cheers and then stephen started again
he began excellently with keatss  ode to
a nightingale and scored  lines and
without any pause went on to miltons
 lallegro  of which he delivered 
lines before breaking down he paused a
little and then did odds and ends of verses
some complete and some not thomas
hoods  departure of summer   lines
shelleys  to-night   and a song by
shelley commencing 

   rarely rarely comest thou

spirit oj delight    lines

  i will not enumerate all these poems but
he amassed altogether  lines in this way
then he had another brief rest and reverted
once more to shakespeare in his little
sing-song voice without any attempt at
dramatic expression he reeled off  lines
of the balcony scene from romeo and
juliet  lines of the scene between
hamlet and the queen   lines of the
brutus and cassius quarrel   of jaquess
speech on  all the worlds a stage it
need hardly be said that by this time the
good burghers of tibbelsford were in a
state of the wildest excitement

  the schoolmaster announced that master
stephen had now scored  of the requisite
 so that he only wanted  more to
win mr stourway was biting his nails
and loolring green mrs stourway looked

as though she was disgusted with her 
husband for having brought her among 
these common people nick sneered super- 
cihously

  but in the meantime there was no j
question but that master stephen himself j
was getting distressed his small voice
was getting huskier and huskier and tears
seemed not far off i heard mrs rush-
bridger sitting behind me remark

    poor little mite  i calls it a shime  

  it was also evident that he was getting
seriously to the end of his quoting riper j
toire he had no other long speeches 
the landlords party gathered round him
and whispered

  he tried again short stanzas and odd
verses sometimes unfinished he kept the
schoolmaster very busy  but he blundered
on by these uncertain stages he managed
to add another  lines and then he
suddenly brought off a veritable tour dt
force it was quite uncanny he quoted
xog lines of spensers  faerie queen e  
the matter was quite unintelligible to the
audience and they were whispering to each
other and asking what it was when he
broke down the schoolmaster announced -
that it was quite in order and that master
stephens total lines quoted now amounted
to  and that therefore he only required
four lines to win 

  even then the battle was apparently not
over every one was cheering and making
such a noise that the small boy could not
understand it and he began crying a to
of people in the audience were calling out

 shame   and there was ail the appear-
ance of a disturbance- tbe landlord
party was very occupied it was several
minutes before order was restored and
then the landlord rapped on the table and
called out  order  order  

  he drank a glass of water and there
a dead silence stephens mother held the
little boy very tight and smiled at hifl-
at last raising his voice for this last de-
spairing effort he declaimed quite loudly 

 why all the saints and sages who dis-
      cussd

  of the two worlds so wisely-they 
      thrust

  like foolish prophets forth  lhf
     words to scorn	

   are scalierd and their mouths are sitf
      with dust

  the cheers which greeted this triumph
climax were split by various disturbance
the most distressing coming from steph
stacy aumonier

 wseif fr almost as he uttered the last
 ord he gave a yell and burst into sobs

 he sobbed and sobbed aud sobbed
 bd his mother picked him up and rocked
 and thc landlorcl and his wife did what
 hey coaid but it was quite hopeless
 ephca was finished his mother picked
 op and hurried out of the door at the
 with him the stourway party
 wted away there were no more
 hmches but people crowded on to the
 platform and a lot of the women wanted

 	ijt to kiss stephen before he went away 

mrs wright camc back and said the
j child was very upset she was afraid
thy ought not to have let him do it his
jtothcr was putting him to bed in one of
rooms and they were giving him some
hh volatile he would be all right soon
coursc- was a tremendous effort
a tiny person too 

 some one offered to go for the doctor
 mrs wright said they would sec how
 r was and if he wasnt better in half an
 fjjurs time theyd send over to doctor
 much

 jevery one was congratulating the land-
 and he was clasping hands and saying 

   a marvellous boy  a marvellous boy i
  teew he would do it i 

  jhe party gradually broke up

  	must now again revert to myself 
 enormously impressed by what  had
and heard and for the rest of the
tuning i could think of nothing else
ti-r dhuier i went out for a stroll it was
jiy march and unseasonably cold when
jt down to the bridge over which the
pfik-road run across the open country to
ehurst large snowflakes were falling i
d there fot some time looking at our
- little river and thinking of the land-
and stephen and as i gazed around

    	began to wonder what it was about
 snow-flakes which seemed to dovetail
l-gtti certain subconscious movements go-
  oo within me

  and suddenly a phrase leapt into mv
  di it was

    km ten cotton gloves  

	iotten cotton gloves what was the
nectl  the snow the mood sotne-
about stephens voice quoting  the
yre queene  very slowly the tiring
j to unfold itself and when i began
jahxr it ail  said to myself  yes my
 it was the faerie qnecne which
the show away the rest might have
tat possible you were getting rather
put to it i 
llc snow was falling heavily it was

christmas-time-good lord  i did not
like to think bow- long ago  thirty years 
forty years  my sister and i at drury
lane pantomime  rotten cotton
gloves   yes that was it i i could
remember nothing at all of the perform-
ance bat who was that great man they
spoke of  the star attraction -some
name like  the great borodin the worlds
most famous humorist and ventriloquist
we were very excited phyllis and i very
small people then surely not much older
than stephen himself  could not re-
member the great borodin but i remem-
bered that one phrase there was a small
lay figure which said most amusing things
it was called-no  have forgotten it
was dressed in an eton suit and it wore
rather dilapidatcd-looking white cotton
gloves and every now and then in the
middle of a dialogue or discourse it broke
off looked at its hands and muttered 

   rotten cotton gloves  

  it became a sort of catch-phrase in
london in those days on buses and
trains people would murmur  rotten
cotton gloves i  a ccrtain vague some-
thing about the way that stephen recited
spensers  faerie queeue  was it
possible 

  and then certain very definite aspects
of the competition presented themselves to
my minds eye it had all been very
cleverly stage-managed it must be ob-
served that stephen neither walked on
nor walked off he did not even stand
he hardly looked at the audience and
then the lighting was inexcusably bad
even some of the lights in the central
chandelier had unaccountably failed and
the landlords party had chosen the darkest
side of the stage no one had spoken to
the boy no one had seen him arrive and
immediately aftqr the competition he had
gone straight to bed

  i tried to probe my-memory for know-
ledge of the great borodin but at
eight or nine one does not take great in-
terest in these details  know there was
something  i remember hearing my
parents talking about it-some great
scandal soon after i had seen him lie was
disgraced  am sure  have a vague idea
lie was in some way wcll-connectcd he
was to marry a great lady and then perhaps
he eloped with a young barmaid  i can-
uot be ccrtain it was something like that
i know he disappeared from public life
for in after years when people had been
to similar prloi inances  bod heard our
parent say


hutchinsons story magazine

   ah but you should have seen  the
great borodin 

  these memories the peculiar thrill of
the competition the cold air the lazy
snow-flakes drifting hither and thither ail
excited me  walked on farther aud
farther into the country trying to piece it
all together i liked the landlord and i
shared the popular dislike of mr stourway

  after a time  returned and making my
way towards thf north of the town i
started to walk quickly in the direction of
 the love-a-duck if i hurried i should
le there ten minutes or so before closing-
time

  when i entered the large bar-parlour
the place was very crowded  met old
hargreaves by the door im afraid a good
many rules of the society had been broken
that evening old hargreaves was not
the only one who had had quite enough
liquid refreshment everybody was in
high spirits and they were still all talking
about the competition i met mr bean
near the fireplace and  said

   well mr bean and have you heard
how the boy is r
 oh ay he replied  he soon got
all right mrs wright says he were just
a bit upset he went of home not an
hour since

   did you see him  

   eh  oh no  didnt see m mrs
wright says he looked quite hisself

  the landlord was moving ponderously
up and down behind the bar i thought
he looked tired and there were dark rims
round his eyes  moved up towards the
bar and he didnt notice me the noise
of talking was so loud that one could speak
in a normal voice without being heard
everything had apparently gone oil quite
successfully mr stourway had sent along
his cheque for five pounds and it was
reckoned that he would never show his
face in  the love-a-duck again i
waited

  at last i noticed that the landlord was
quite alone he was leaning against the
serving-hatch flicking some crumbs from
his waistcoat as though waiting for the
moment of release i took my glass and
sidled up to him i leant forward as
though to speak he glanced at me and
inclined his head with a bored movement
when his ear was within a reasonable dis-
tance  said quic-uy

   rotten cotton gloves 

  i shall never forget the expression on the
face of the landlord as he slowly raised hi
head i was conscious of being a pin-point 
in a vast perspective his large rather j
colourless eyes appeared to sweep the whole
room they were moreover charged with i
a perfectly controlled expression of sur- 
prise and a kind of uncontrolled lustre ol
ironic humour i had a feeling that if h
laughed it would be the end of all thi
he did not laugh  he looked lugubrio
right through my face and breat
heavily then he swayed slightly frc i
side to side and looked at ray hat ana 
said 

   ive got some cherry-brandy here 
youd like you must have a glass- 
sir-

  now i do not wish to appear to yo j
either as a prig a traitor or a profiteer i j
am indeed a very ordinary perhaps ovcf- i
human member of tibbelsford society 
if i have taken certain advantages of the
landlord you must at any rate give nc
the credit of being the only member of tt
large audience who had the right intuition
at the right moment in all othor rrspec
you must acknowledge that  have treat j
him rather well in any case i bccn
prominent in the inner circle without untie- j
going the tortuous novitiateship of th
casual stranger

  the landlord and i are the best of friend j
to this day although wc exchange no eflgs
fidences i can break all the rules of tle
masonic understanding without gcttior j
into trouble some of the others at
amazed at the liberties i take

  and in thfe days when hcensrf
restrictions arc so severe when fcrt
things are not to be got officially
when i sec my friends stealing home to 
bone-dry supper i only have to creep
the bar of  the love-a-duck  and whi

 rotten cotton gloves   and lo  all
forbidden luxuries are placed at my y 
posal can you hiatne me 

  i have said that we exchange no ctlj
fidences and indeed i feel that that wo
be going too far taking too great 
advantage of my position there is  
one small point i would love to

         feminine miracle that sometimes
         t foster-inothers she took the

soldiers orphan more closely to her bosom
than the two sons of her own blood it
was a labour of love with mrs stubbs to
see that this waif  look at his bonnie
eye dad   had everything  as nice as
his own poor mother could have wished

  i am afraid his own poor mother woalr
have been rather distressed at many things
in his upbringing among these kindly folk
who taught him to call a table-napkin a
 servyette she would have  minded 
-and so would his father -that there
was no chance of dicks being sent to the
kind of preparatory school which-well
in his family it had always been followed
as the night the day by public-school
sandhurst and one or two regiments or so
she would have taken as a tragedy
what the stubbses took as a great blessing
-namely that at sixteen young dick
had his start in life-a stool in the man-
chester office with his foster-brothers cecil
and herbert stubbs

   generations of soldier-blood in the boya
veins clamoured for a very different sort
of life he read kipling and wished lie
knew somebody who could have talked to
him about his father in india there
seemed no chance of his ever getting to do
so  it seemed as if his life-lines were
pretty definitely laid down when he wa
sixteen

  at sixteen too he was in love-and
beloved now his mother who had realised
early the imparlance of women to s sons
career would have felt that her last words
had been gasped out in vain she had not
wished him to be luved by a girl like little

not true tbat boys never fall in love with
the girls with whom they are brought up
the apple falls at the loot of the tree
again and again boys fall in lov with the
girl who is there

  little connie was boro two years after
dicks arrival from india the only girl
in a household of boys  but dick was
her small majestys favourite slave when
she was  a terror  for any one else she
would be  good for dick she would
 laugh for dick  out of her bassinette
dick taught hcr to walk they learnt to
read together dicks dusky cropped head
bent above the alphabet close to hcr pale
gold riuglets filleted with pale blue she
had a funny lit tie way of smiling down at
the  royal reader  in delight when she
had put a word together quicker than tho
boy dick thought her lovely and at
six brought all the pennies of his money-
box to buy her a birthday present of an
india-rubber duck

  after that it was an institution  our
connies birthday present for weeks
every year dick saved up for i put them
in order the rag-doll the teddies one
two and three  the paint-box the glass-
lidded box of beads  the sailor-dolly  the
dolls tea-set and the dolls pram

  then came the birthday on which
connie came home from the holidays from
a school more expensive than that to which
the three boys had been sent her goldy
ringlets were no longer filleted but tied
at the nape of her neck by a big sky-blue
how and her dancing shoes had louis heels
 like lots of the girls dick who was
now going to the office had already bought
her a pink satin hat for the biggest doll
quite suddenly he saw this would never do
the woman at the toy-shop usually dis-
obliging on principle took it back without
a murmur from dick he bought instead
a large bottle of white rose in a case

  from this moment little conmc realised
that she loved dick as a man she ceased
to kiss him and began to smile at him
a provocalivc downward smile without
looking at him she knew before he did
that he would for this give her anything
that she asked she was not a thinker or
she might have given thought tothestrange-
ness of the little little things whereby one
woman becomes different from others in a
mans eyes

  upon her next birthday dicks gift was
a silver bangle with cowbells dang ling 
the birthday after a brooch composed of
two swallows in turquoises wings out-
spread aud beaks together she had now

begun to let him kiss hcr her sevente
birthday saw her exclaiming over a si
gold chain to which there was attacl
a pendant a fat little gold heart

   thats mine dick muttered to
 its all yours you know

   oh goodness ejaculated little o
she didnt know what else to sav she
notasayer but all was said as she t
upon this treasure her downward s
shyness and ecstasy   

  her people said there was plenty of
to think about that sort of thing one
or the other but on connies eight
birthday it seemed as if there might
be so much time any more dicks pre

regiment and he came to deliver it in 
and on draft leave for this was in

su it was that herbert stubbs who
sot his commission came back to

	in manchester without his foster-
dicks letter of explanation ar-
jt as the war-fatted calf was being
ife a for the arrival of both the boys
nl mrs stubbs repeated several

times that it was natural after all that
dick should want to go and look up these
new people who could tell him something
about his father and that pretty young
mother of his that vhe boy had never
seen - or her him really as mrs stubbs
added blowing her nose on her husbands
handkerchief and conclnding that there
was nothing for anybody to mind

  as for little connie she said nothing
and seemed absorbed in the humours of
herberts new mess as related by her
brother

  not even her mother knew that when
after a leave-orgie at the theatre with
i ierbert and some of his pals the girl went
to ht room she did not undress quickly
and slip into bed

  instead she opened a drawer and took
from it a card board-box containing some
battered-looldng dolls part of a dolls
tea-set and an ornate glass bottle that
had contained whitc rose the cow-bell
bangle the swallow lrooch the plump
golden heart on its chain and the regi-
mental badge she was wearing as usual
the other things she set on the bed she
smiled an uncertain brooding downward
smile upon them once then dressed as
she was in her bright frock the little
creature lay down without sobbing
without sound or movement she lay rigid
under the eiderdown her sentimental relics
close beside her until the chill spring
dawn she lay staring with an intensity
into the darkness her inward eyes seeing
the face of dick

  dick who could already see nothing
but the face of another girl-the proud
and sweet young face of his friends sister
sybil le breton

  sybil was a fevclation to dick be-
cause   

  well every young man in love tells you
that the girl has  opened a new world 
to him sybil tall slim and a pearly-
skinned brunette opened to this worshipper
the world of his mother that pretty and
ambitious and prejudiced woman would
have summed up the situation by saying
that sybil was the first  lady  he had
ever known

  whereas dick told himself that it was
because she was just sybil that her
voice and ways and looks were different
from those of any other girl he had met
he realised at once and hopelessly that he
loved her the way she spoke to her
father  the way she called the dogs  hex

slender hand in his when she said good-
night  the queenly little lift of her chin 
her sweet direct eyes  a tag of public-
school slang sounding quaintly on her lips
 all these he adored

   just as dear to him were her outlook on
all the tilings for which he cared her pride
in her mcn-folk her inclusion of himself
among her own people  he felt that   

   her father smoking after dinner told
him casually that it was jolly here in the
summer when there would be tennis and
punting even if it were a bit dull just now

    dull sir   echoed poor dick

  for six nights of his leave the boy
reminded himself that he hadnt an earthly
hadnt a brown or any prospects and that
as soon as he went away it  must be good-
bye-ee   to these hopeless dreams as
well as to the princess of them

   still there were four precious days left
in which he might look at sybil might talk
and walk with sybil dance with sybil to
the gramophone in the evening run up to
town and do a matinde with sybil he
need not bother sybil by letting her suspect
that he had made a young ass of himself
that he determined

   the boy proposed to her on the seventh
day of his leave

   immediately afterwards he admitted that
he had been mad that hed no right to say
a word but that she was so lovely he
couldnt help it and that if she could give
him a little hope to go away with he would
do his absolute dashedness to make good

   sybil gave him her direct gaze and said
quite simply and royally  but  wished
you to i care for you  

   her people took it in the same spirit 
her mother just saying  poor mabel s
loy  how delightful   and her father
 in these days one is quite thankful for os
to keep together a bit   and dick
was caught up so high into the seventh
heaven that he almost forgot to write and
tell them about it in the north

  manchester which had become shadowy
before ever he met sybil was now a dream

   home  was sybil-if only he could grow
worthy of her  as for little connie he
forgot her with the completeness of which
a young man is master at these moments
at the beginning of his visit memories
had occasionally come to kim of the little
foster-sister memories that showed her so
changcd  for in the light of the revela-
tion of sybil he saw connie as a pretty
little thing who dressed as if she came from
behind the glove counter at ballings worths
and who put on rather too much sccnt and

rather too many bits of cheap jc--a
and who said  lay down  insteaij
 lie down  to the kitten who excl
 oh goodness   too often and
called a table-napkin a  servyette

  the manchester people wrote pro
and conventionally but kindly aboj
news connie didnt write but then
never had been a writer  he never
anything but postcards and parcels
connie she sent her love and verv
wishes in her mothers letter and
goodness there was nothing in that
all about  shock  nr  losing hin

 forgetting poor old ma hed
little afraid of that and now-
no he wasnt hurt far from it 
there wasnt anything the stul
not a family to put anything in
dick concluded that the war
changes everything had got the sto
accustomed to the idea that a fost
is no relation and that he dick
definitely left their nest

  it might have been a war-wedding
he went back but for leave being
cut short sybils fiancd returned to
and duty with intervals of scribbling
letters-sybils letters were wonder 
and of longing 

   he got no more leave until the fol

 l throwing oil some light burden and
 gg it before her to see

 its just this he confessed  to-day
  i was looking at the calendar again
 s to see for myself how many dates id
 you know now how ive been
 wjing out the days till our wedding 
 i it was the thiril of august well you
 thats little connies birthday-
 aie stubbs my foster-sister

   oh yes said sybil very gently she
   heard a little about connie and she
   guessed a good deal more

 said  every year up to now ive
 go a present to the kid last august
 a souvenir shell-case this year i
 forgot about everything of course
 somehow when i remembered 
 i to sec hcr uttle face-shes such a
  u blank and disappointed because
 dnt thought of her

   my dear boy   said sybil quickly  if

s all- of course she must have a

    t isnt the house full of presents 
    go in now and choose something for
   t of onr wedding-presents  and you
   vc it her on her birthday after all
   pto manchester this afternoon-youll
   here for dinner-and come back to-
   ow morning its the simplest thing
   world i

 ck said  it is to yon theres no-
 hke you sybil in the world
 y-wc and choose she smiled they
 lhe punt and went into the house to
 in the drifts of tissue paper and
 cases dicks first choice was of a
  heart-shaped photograph frame that
  looked rather like connie

sybil said quickly  you cant give her
that  my dear thing she sent it to us 
look heres this little indian hand mirror 
this is rather sweet and besides they always
say that the gift of a mirror that a woman
has had brings luck to the next owner
take her this dick

  dick said  its topping but can you
spare it    hut of course said sybil
and she added inwardly  if  can spare
him for all those hours  but i owe hcr
this one last time-poor litt le child i 

  taking the wedding-present that was to
be a birthday-gift dick went off to man-
chester his last look back at sybil
showed her standing on the white steps of her
home  her green gown suiting the delicate
dignity of her ggurc as its foliage suits the
birch a gracious sight she was    her
last look gave his salute and the worshipping
turn towards her of his handsome eyes

  it was the last time she was to see them

  he went with her offering to the girl
who was ten times less than she in beauty
brain breeding and all else but one thing

  that one thing what was it  was it
part of the temperament that could let
little connie lie tense and tearless fully
dressed through the night to ache for him 
was it the single-mindedness that knew no
pride in anything but him no interest no
delight  what spell of years past lent
magic to her bodily presence as soon as he
was in her sight once more 

  for dick did not return next morning as
he had arranged that evening sybil le
breton got his expressed letter curt with
the curtncss of a man profoundly agitated

   i can never ask you to forgive me
dick wrote  as soon as i got back home
and saw her little face i knew it would have
to be her and not you and so we were
married this morning 

  as sybil guessed he had shown this letter
to his wife

  little connie had read it silently
seriously only as she turned away-and
how should sybil guess this -there had
crossed her face the expression with which
she had rreeied dicks svdden appearance the
day before it was her childs look ol
triumph her young-girls look of shyness
and rapture her womans look-that
haunting withheld mysterious secret and
stirring downward stnile

pak had never made warm friends
therefore no one was sorry for pak
 pak of pennyfields  was how he
was known in the east of london where he
had lived ever since landing in england
some tight years ago

  how nervously happy he had been how-
important and excited i both emotions
had been hidden to the best of paks
ability for did not zia his wonderful bride
look up and depend absolutely on her man

  zia was then a little young thing of
sixteen pak was a man in his twentieth
year so of course it behoved him to show
zia what a pillar of strength she had to lean
on in this new country where he had
brought her so far far from poland

 poland where jews were not human
beings but merely cumberers of the earth

  now here in england pak was a man
and zia a woman

  and as a man pak was to die in a few
hours time

  it was not of his approaching end that
ho thought rather his mind dwelt on the
only true comrade he had ever known his
little son jacob

  tho fathers heart swelled as h recalled
the beauty and cleverness of small jacob

 that little one would have been a great



 man he smiled and then the smile 
 the softness left paks eyes his diminu
 frame stiffened involuntarily his
 tensed

involuntarily
he held them crooked before

woib

 his lips drew back banng his teeth in a
 pak nlone in his prison cell lived agai 
 last minutes of his freedom befofj
 police---  ah well jacob would
 been eight years of age had he lived  ah
  my son is a english little fellar he
 bom here pak had been proud of
 dudng jacob to all and sundry with
 remarks

   it was true enough the babe had
 to rejoice the live of his parent
 months from the time they left iouuw
 had settled in crutch walk uhitechjg
 in a room a whole room to thejj
 that had been rented to the husband
 wife by nicolas markovitch vcond c 
 to pak in nicolass own house over
 own shop	l

 him he was not only large of build a
  broad chap with huge shoulders and e
 mous head but he was rich as well nbat
 the only things that were
 nicolas were his eyes hi mind 
 moral sense but the rest of his ma
 compensated for lack of greatness in e
 mind and morality	

   nicolas not only rented pak and

     hut paid pak as much a twelve
     h shillings a week to work for him

  si	extracting three of these shillings
  in payment for the six by-eight attic
  pwhjch the happy husband and wife lived
  ssjwntcmedly as though the panes in the
  pjjws were unbroken the paper did not
  in damp strips from the narrow walls
  the ceiling did not sag menacingly in

y spot

they had a room a home to them-

 sy looked into one anothers eyes and

and the large nicolas had personally
ucted them to the attic and after
tng on his generosity to this poor
j-in of his from poland had left them
wbcir two neat bundles which contained
worldly goods in this paradise
jcaned with a three-legged chair a candle
 and on the floor a straw mattress

ks gratitude had been supreme he
from sun-up till midnight and

lull worth of the generous wage he paid

in to great ail vantage in the shop

g	juit abuiv the chima left

iak worked hard-r than ever his
gjgg imply flew over the work as he
dreams of a future when little
 become big jacob and show
what a really clever man could do
pak became almost rig itened

srandiloqaeace of hia own ambitions

for this son of hi he pictured jacob as
even owning a shop oi his own similar to
that of the great markovitch but these
romantic thoughts were told to no one but
zia and even to her only in the lowest of
whispers

  little jacob inherited his mothers great
soft eyes which had so thrilled pak when he
first mot his zia-large brown appealing
eyes that set in zias lovely oval face
called to all who saw them even nicolas
himself was not impervious to their allure
nor indeed to the girl-wifes whole beauty
for beautiful zia certainly was her clear
skin of olive tint with the very scarlet lips
that go with such a complexion the masses
of soft hair black as the wing of a raven
growing low down on a smooth broad fore-
head the sensitive nostrils of a perfectly
shaped nose tiny cars and hands all
helped make zia the lovely woman she was
there would come into the narrow eyes of
nicolas an evil gleam when he encountered
zia her slender figure with its gently
swelling bust and hips did not escapc his
notice

  zia was a polish jewess therefore from
cruel necessity she was not innocent she
knew the meaning of such expression as she
saw in the coarse voluptuous face of nicolas
markovitch but she loved her little husband
and adored her precious babe and held her
peace whilst she skilfully endeavoured to
avoid their landlord as much as possible

   you stay up in the room too much you
be ill you come out for walking nicolas
invited one day on meeting zia as she came
into the shop to bring back some work
pak had just completed

   i no sick tank you nicolas she
replied timidly

    you come it was half invitation
hall command

   i no leave my baby zia placcd the
work on the counter and edged nervously
back towards the rickety stairs

  that bratl nicolas was irritated
 you leave im e sleep

   e wake up cry for me is muma
explained zia

   pak attend to im you come scowled
nicolas

   pak must be busy with is work

   just like i knew a big fool was i a
soft- earted big fool to ave pak in my
work with a baby childrens ia no good
for work

  nicolas was really annoyed and zia
trembled

  what if she aod pak were turned out into
the street with baby jacob i


hutchinsons story magazine

   me i go ask pak she soothed and
nicolas nodded assent

   i mind the little fcllar it do you good
my zia to go out nice walkin with nicolas
smiled pak pansing for the fraction of a
precious minute to look lovingly at his wife
and to steal a glance at the child who lay
peacefully sleeping on the coarse mattress
close to where pak sat cross-legged with a
pile of clothing ready to be stitched along-
side him

  several times during the hour that
followed the father indulged in the luxury
of an adoring gaze at the head of black
silken curls and each time his eyes fell on
the curious brown mole over his sons left
temple he smiled  that distinctive mark
pleased him he never failed to kiss it when
he held the child in his arms  ah h that
nicolas is a good fellar e ave a big cart
god is good even elp the jew communed
pak and his simple heart sent up a prayer
of thanksgiving

  the babe was awake when zia returned
hushed and excited from her unusual
excursion

   wc been a long walk up the commer-
cial road rushing to pick up her baby
smothering him with kisses s she scanned
him with anxious eyes for this was the
first time she had left little jacob for more
than a few minutes

   nicolas e make me ave some wine in
a nice glass e say it do me good  and
hitting down on the mattress with her
babe in her arms  it make me feel all
fonny aud giddy she explained

   that nicolas is a wise one c is a good
chap applauded pak then a most
phenomenal thing occurred pak dropped
his work 

   zia my zia w beautiful you are i  he
breathed

   what  oh you grow silly my little
usband but zia laughed well pleased at
the praise

   your eyes they shine like great stars
and you ave pink in your cheeks like the
new sun that come up through the window
iu the morning oh my zia my wonderful
darling

  pak worked until after midnight to atone
for the five minutes spell he had given him-
self in which to worship the mother and
child-his whole world

ii

  the first tiny black spot appeared on the
horizon ol l-aks happiness when he found
zia crying on the stairs one day i le insisted
on knowing tbe cause zia had completely

broken down and confessed that n
was making her life unbearable by his
desired attentions

  small as he was pak faced the
nicolas in a fury of rage commanding t
his wife be left in peace

   that is the way always one see
begger ou orseback e get too saucy
is place you get out of ere you
quick or i lack you out see i ate
and i ate your kid with is bad mark
is cad see  

  paks fury increased to blind rage at
insult to his son he grew livid and 
with the strength of his emotion as
hurled insults and threats at the eq
angry markovitch

   i put you before the door you go
i send for policemans had been the
words pak heard from his cousin
he rushed up the crazy stairs and gat
together the family belongings along
jacob and the frightened zia had c
them all out into crutch walk
commercial road eventually landing
in sydney street where he found
in the house of a lascar who kept a
ing house mainly for his own

 pak soon found work but he was

to go out to his tailoring and that

leaving zia and jacob alone for sixteen
eighteen hours out o t every twenty-foujvj
zias beauty had increased with y 
until now she was too dangerously attf

  with a heavy heart pak had been

      greatly esteemed as adding to his
   aiy beauty

 lang hi did a thriving trade both with

seldom spoke and never showed
ment not even when he got the big
jn puk-a-pue by hitting on the whole
which gamblers were allowed to
for the sum of one shilling lung
not an individual to be overlooked 
onality allied to his success at
money gave him quite a standing

t had accepted this employment in
andry as a desperate means to ward
 starvation that threatened his small
uy and at the same time keep them
 under his protection

only for a little short time my zia
jsured his wife  soon oh very soon i
find me another job with the tailoring
will work ard and make much much
for you and that big clever rascal

   i think me it would ave been better
   ad not been such a fool with that
   nicolas grumbled zia for the bitter
    had been full of hardships

xot that zia my heart pleaded pak
is one devil dog e would ave
you from ma and from our jacob
ot any one in the world could take me

    	my baby declared zia fiercely pick-
       son up in her arms and holding him

mummie stop with daddy and me
bjcob patting her checks with his tiny

  jvuh a tender smile pak leaned over and
i  the  lucky mark  on the boys
imple

first zia worked with pak at the
board it was here she made friends
e beela the fair haired girl-woman of
her own age who having drifted into
lsno one quite knew or cared how
tarried a chinaman she spoke like
and doubtless was one but
expansive enough on most subjects
etmod a careful reticence as to her
slenm

jhe chinks is all right if you treat them

      	she confided to zia as the two
      side by side with a dosn or so young
      n   am married to one and 
      fcen married to a white man so
      tht ter know she asserted with

           beave best to you beela  
   tl a curiously

mt much to etioose a white will

black your eye while a chink will cut your
b-throat stated beela calmly

    you no frighten of chinaman beela  

    i aint frightened of man nor monkey
bragged boela   you only got to know ow
to manage em and theyre simple as
drinkin gin if youve took up with a
white keep out of is way when es in
drink if youve took up with a chink
theres some things you got to remember
if you dont want is klife acrost your
throat one thing is dont talk to a chink
before twelve oclock specially if es goin
to avo a flutter at fan-tan if youre is
own bloomin wife and youre bein mur-
dered e wont come to your elp if its
before twelve oclock not m  let you die
e will them silly chinks thinks its bad
luck for a woman to speak to em before
midday and so beela imparted wisdom
as she had learned it in the east end whilst
zia listened spell-bound

   pak did not approve of the sudden friend-
ship that had sprung up between his wife
and beela but it would have been difficult
to stop it on account of their enforced pro-
pinquity  he consoled himself continually
by asserting that he  would soon find
another job

  but month after month crept by and
still found lum in the employ of lung
hi

  at first lung hi appeared to disregard
pak and his family they were good worker
so he paid them as he did any other toiler
in his laundry then gradually he began to
pay some attention to jacob many a time
he would slip a copper into the tiny hands
for sweets but in spite of his generosity
the boy was too like his father in character
to readily make friends he would stand of
and stare with large brown fascinated
eyes at the fat chinaman and most of all
at the bright orange cord perhaps it was
the gaudy colour that caught the baby
eye and held it but whatever it was little
jacob could not keep lus gare from the cord
whenever he was in lung his vicinity

    you like it eh f  lung hi asked the
boy one day touching the cord that hung
on his cheat

   yes nodded jacob

   maybe i give it you one day btme-
by and lung hi smiled

  now lung his smile was something to
be feared it was a very slow widening of
his mouth his eyes never smiled

  with a temfied shnek of  daddi
jacob took to ins heels and rushed to lus
fathers side

   what the matter with you   asked

q
 hutchinsons story magazine

pak placing his iron carefully on the stand
before stooping down to his son

   n-nothing confessed jacob

   nothing i then why you cry out why
you all tremble tell too that   pak looked
anxiously at the little chap who only shook
his head as he clung close to his father

   where is muramie   he asked

   mummie gone with bcela for walking
and pak sighed zia was often away with
bcela these days  you be good boy sit
here and i give you hapenny he coaxed
pushing back the silky black curls in order
to caress the  lucky mark

   tell me about the garden with the
flowers daddie begged the child seating
himself obediently out of the way of the
ironers as pak worked he spoke of the
garden he had conjured out of his vivid
imagination to please little jacob whose
eyes and soul were starved for the softness
and colour he loved from hearsay alone
for jacob had never seen a garden ex-
cepting through his fathers eyes

  whenever the highly strung boy was
wakeful or feverish he could always be
soothed to rest and sleep by word painting
of beauty and colour

  now he listend intently as his parent told
him of magic fields covered with soft green
grasses all damp with dcwdrops of little
blue flowers the colour of stars of big red
roses pink roses white roses as soft as his
own mummies satiny cheek

   and could i touch them daddie  
pleaded jacob breathlessly

   touch them  why you pick one two
tree many as you like they all yours
and small yellar flowers like gold-

   like lung his cord  

   yes like vs cord and you make a lot
of them in a necklace one for you and one
for your mother and they smell so sweet
they send you bye-bye and when you wake
up-hi  you see a lot new flowers the good
god drop down for you to play with then
jou walk over a small hill and you come to
the big blue sea--

   like the canal daddie   jacob
shrank a little for the dark turgid water at
dukes wharf through liinehouse hole
where ho so often played both fascinated
and terrified him

   yes but more beautifuller pak assured
him

    no no  like the garden best

  smilingly pak abandoned the sea and
reverted to glowing descriptions of such a
garden a has never been seen outside of
heaven while the beauty-loving child hung
on his every wri

  as pak talked his thoughts were
zia where was she  where was
leading her  the little jews heart
heavy

   you go and ask the old blighter toj
us ave alf an hour ofi zia bcela
snggest  e likes you all right e  le

   why you not ask im   zia hail
first objected

    i aint is first favrite ere  youre
all right the astute beela assured her

    not want to leave my jacob

   youre fair balmy about that
pak  look after im and gradually
had allowed herself to be persuaded
begging for half-hours off with her f 

  at first lung hi scarcely seemed to
heard zias timid requests a mere nx
his head was the only answer he gave
eyes as they looked at zia appeared si 
and duller than ever these half-
grew into hours then into half-days
sometimes whole ones still lung h
nothing perhaps he did not notice
girls absence at any rate pak hoped
did not for he became increasingly fej
of losing his job	

  on her return from these jaunt rrl
pak noticed with a strong feeling ol
easiness that zia appeared changedjf
would be cither wildly excited or so
and irritable that it would be rnwis 
even speak to her	v

  but in whatever condition she lainejs
her first thought was always for her c 
whom she would pet and fondle and
over telling him that  whatever hpfe
his mummie would always love him  
never no never leave him	jj

   when daddie get rich i go to a

lowers and one for me and on 
daddie promised jacob

  a long time before pak began to
 jjce that lung hi was most often absent
 zia was not in the laundry then a
 i	word drifted to his ears coupling

 roe of his wife with that of lung his
  ne two had been seen together entering
 jture palace-at least so it was said 
 livpak knew that could not he true for zia

 jjj hot resentment against life generally

 t pak could not give these things to

 hbld her head high and unconsciously
 vjd  the curious heavy bitter odour that
 eotmd the fssage which she entered

dorota flatau

after roughly brushing aside two young
chinamen who lounged on the door-step
without a pause she ascended the short
flight of steps and opening a door passed
into a poorly lighted sparsely furnished
room where the several chinamen who were
seated tranquilly smoking did not even
look up at her as she entered it was
lung hi who handed her a pipe and after
a whiff or so zias discontent and impatience
left her she sat as quietly and dreamily
as the other occupants of the room

  lung hi fingering his orange neck-cord
watched her with unfathomable eyes he
wanted this woman he must have her he
would have her his eyes were almost closed
the tip of his tongue licked his upper lip
under the straggly moustaches his liands
opened and closed very slowly

  lung hi had demanded nothing from
zia when he presented her with money
clothes jewellery or took her to music-haus
and other amusements which pak credited
to beelas generosity no lung hi was
too thorough too cunning to make a
demand  he hinted lie requested and took
zias rebuffs good-naturedly while he
studied the question

  zia was a jewess therefore her moral
standpoint was high but zia was a woman
and therefore to be tempted lung hi
went carefully and systematically to work

  beela had quite unconsciously come to
his assistance  lung hi gloated secretly
when he saw the two girls going ofi arm-in-
arm on their perfectly innocent jaunts

  the first time he allowed himself to meet
them he merely spoke a few good-natured
words and passed on gradually these
seemingly accidental encounters happened
more and still more often and the few
words grew into conversations then be
took to accompanying them on their excur-
sions until zia scarcely remarked the
first time she and lung hi met with no
beela present

  nowadays zia seldom saw beela but
it was seldom she did not spend an hour
or so in lung his company not out of
any affection tor the fat chinaman but
because he had accustomed her to look to
him for any little luxury she wished to
possess she had but to ask lung hi gave
willingly

  lung hi squatting on the wooden bench
in this silent darkened room watched zia
who seated on a low stool sat with arms
hanging listlessly by her sides her head
bent on her chest and decided that such
a prize was well worth all the tune and
thought h had given although so fax


 hutchinsons story magazine

zia had given him nothing but an occa-
sional smile and many hours of her company

  it was not pak who stood in lung his
way nor was it only zias rigid sense of
morality the real block in the path was
jacob zia would do nothing that might
liarm her son or tliat might lead to her
losing him then-lung his mouth
widened in a slow grin-jacob must be got
rid of

  after this decision he took to studying
the boy and often jacob would look up
from his play down at dukes wharf
where he spent much time in fishing up
pieces of chalk and driftwood from the
foul water to see lung hi standing silently
fingering the orange cord and watching
him

  the ugly whispers coupling lung his
name with that of zias grew to loud con-
temptuous talk until pak was driven well-
nigh crazy he took to doing without some
of his already too sparse meals in order to
save enough money to justify him in taking
an hour off from the laundry to hunt up
another job  another job  would surely
give him back his former happiness would
break down the wall that had impercep-
tibly grown between him and his wile
by living on a starvation diet and working
feverishly he managed to save ten shillings
only then did he feel justified in leaving the
ironing board late one afternoon in order
to seek new work he told no one of his
plans but waiting until the kindly dusk
of five oclock on an autumn afternoon
that would help to hide from a prospective
employer his extreme shabbiness pak
crammed an old oue-time-black hat on his
head and stealthily crept forth from the
laundry

   it was the first time for many a day that
he had gone more than hall a dozen yards
from the place of his toil he felt a wild
excitement take possession ofhim he
would succecd lie must succeed- he
smiled as he pictured zias face when he
informed her that her little husband had
gained a more remunerative position he
felt very sure of himself anti planned that
out of his very first new wages he would
take zia anti jacob on saturday niyht to a
picture-palace a delight of which he had
only heard for so far he had not been in a
position to afford the luxury of a visit to
one of these halls of wonderful entertain-
ment

  keeping close to the wall he trotted
swiftly along for all the world like a stray
dog that fears a cuff or a kick

  it was to the shop of one mauvevitch

that he was bound  he had heard that
aaron manievitch was in need of ef
hands and surely he would not ref-
take so skilled a workman as pak
services

  then he saw a sight that froze his
heart that caused him to stand as t
petrified his mouth and eyes o
wide liis body sagged sideways as he
and stared at his wife his zia co
laughing along with lung hi

  he could not move he could not
his head shook back and forth as t
he had been stricken with a palsy

  he stood rooted to the spot until
after the two had passed out of
neither of the couple had seen him
thought but lung his eyes missed no

  pak felt his head turning round
round he leaned against the wall hi
closed how long he remained thh
never knew but it was almost dark 
his errand forgotten he turned to
his steps his face was wet with the 
that in his weak state had rushed u
from his eyes

  all unconsciously he found his feet
carried him through limehouse hole 
to dukes wharf of course he wanted
little comrade jacob and there he
the child lying flat on bis stomach
down into the thick yellow water of
canal crooning softly to himself

  that night had marked the begin
of the end

  when he spoke to zia of what he
seen she did not even trouble to deny 
 what about it  there is no
lung hi walkin ome with me if we ph
to meet is there   demanded zia

    i not like it zia my own  you ai 
beautiful too good to be with im  j
work ard and buy you nice things  j
very soul was in his eyes as lie spoke- 
 me i am dead before that appen
sneered zia

   no i get me a good job-

   zias raucous laughter interrupted 
he bowed lus head in liis hands and rv
 you not a man pak you cry- jas
always poor  zias brows met in a wjd
she stood looking down at the cn j
figure of her husband with a sen
despair and discontent

   i not poor-look zia i got
tremblingly he displayed his 
meals in the shape of ten shining
 ten bob  zias eyes opened
 yes you take it you ave it
zia my own he begged then as h p  jll

     ability

 q child failed to put in an appearance
 gening with a feeling of growing un-

 he worked his ears listened and his

   zia returned to the laundry that pak

insignificant to trouble about
yr days at a time the father searched
u i tilc jacob without ever returning to

jjjyuir unconscious on the pavement

pd him to the hospital
fcu ras twenty-eight years of age he
nearer fifty when he was discharged
ohospital creeping slowly along his
k atone seemed to live as they again
the search for his little comrade his
fieod in the world

                      feet carried him back
                      zia greeted him with-

e-y	n nc wot

lfcprds evening his
sj nmlr v where i

enthusiasm the loss of her son had
morose and bitterly reckless now
kjfnt openly abroad with lung hi and

k no comment listlessly he re-
kry lor a few houis a day to his ironing
but most often he wandered the

streets looking looking always looking for
a tiny form with a mop of silky black curls
most of all he haunted dukes wharf for
this had been the little chaps favourite
playing-ground

  then there came that evening when he
found himself lying fiat on his stomach as
lie remembered having seeing jacob doing
looking down into the sullen thick water
trying to conjure up the sights that must
have met the baby eves

   what is it you see my little son  tell
your daddie he coaxed softlv as though
the child was really there and your daddie
tell you about pietty garden sure you
go to pretty garden sure  you got lucky
mark you go soon to- christ  

  the mans heart came up into his throat
the water ran unheeded from his mouth
over his parched lipa on to his chest his
breathing came in sibilant whispers there
was madness in his eyes the whole of his
flesh crept for there gazing up at him from
the muddy water was his little sons face

  with a hoarse cry his arms shot out
perhaps lie fell into the canal he did not
know what happened until he found him-
self seated on the bank holding the corpse
of his jacob

  in spite ol the state of the tiny form pak
clung to it raining kisses on the cold face
carefully drying away the water with a
portion of his own clothing  the lucky
mark the lucky mark he was muttering
when his fingers became entangled in a cord
an orange cord that was wound tightly
round the baby neck

  after that pak became very still

  towards the small hours of the morning
he laid the lifeless form in a corner covering
it gently with his coat as he crooned words
of promise to return very soon

  when he had found the box for which
he went in search lie kept his promise to
his son

  removing his own shirt he wrapped it
round the corpse with amazingly steady
fingers he removed the tell-tale orange cord
he kissed his httlc jacob for the last time
before putting him into the candlc box
which he had purloined from a near-by
yard filling the box with flowers he had
climbed a balcouv to steal from their
earthenware pots jacob loved flowers
hr must not go to god without them-pak
saw to that

  the dawn was breaking as he finished
burying the box in a corner of the yard at
the back of the laundry

  then creeping out into the narrow street
he slunk away

v
hutchinsons story magazine

  towards noon fatigue overcame him
entering a public square be sat down on
a seat and slept but even though he sl-pt
his hand never relaxed its grip on that
orange cord

  when he awakened he felt no pain of
grief in his heart only a grim hate a
determination to avenge the death of his
treasure that accomplished he would join
his jacob kindly death would aid him

  three days later he returned to the
laundry

  the laundry was singularly quiet for it
was the chinese new year and therefore
a holiday

  pak seated himself at the back of the
dark shop and waited

  towards midnight lung hi came in
accompanied by zia

  as lung hi struck a match and lighted a
candle pak noticed that zias usually pale
cheeks were scarlet her eyes seemed abnor-
ally large they blazed with excitement
and on her breast hung a wonderful orna-
ment of fine green jade suspended there
by a bright orange cord

  pak burst out laughing it was the first
time ho had laughed for years perhaps his
power of laughter had grown rusty with
long disuse that may have been why zia
cried aloud in fright and why even the
usually imperturbable lung hi started
alarmedly

   pak i zias voice rose in a shrill
scream

   yes pak laughed the owner of that
name

   why you laugh  what the mj
you find jacob   a blend of fea
excitement sounded in zias vic 

    yes me  find the little f- ilar
one would have thought pak had a
joke in his heart   laush my be

zia because one time i tell that little j
we go to a garden and e make
of yallar flowers for you is mum
one for im and now you got your v
necklace and jacob e ave is now
hi must ave is necklace

  with incredible swiftness and
strength of a maniac pak threw hir
the form of the fat lung hi as the 
fearful of what might happen was f
ling clumsily with the fastenings of
laundry door which he had only j
moment ao securely locked	

  lung hi had a large fat neck
hands were not very big without tb
of the strong orange cord he could
have strangled lung hi

  it may have been true that

thrown herself on her husband and 

to tear him from his victim as she told v
police she had done pak did not know j
did he care

  he had avenged the death of his
now iu a few hours he was to be
well that fitted in with his programo
would soon sec his little jacob

grate in the lock of his cell he	i

the distant ball-room

   i repeat said he presently  my
proposition that there are far more marys
in the world than there are williams

   repetition of a statement doe not
convert that statement into a fact and
again i entirely disagree with you

   and a repetition of such disagreement
leaves me e ually unconvinced that you
are right and i am wrong said captain
william chevening hitting out somewhat
viciously at an inuocont palm leaf which


hutchinsons story magazine

through no fault of its own was tickling
the top of his well-brushed head

  she tapped a pretty satin-shod foot ou
the tessellated floor of the conservatory
and suppressed a smile at his boyish anger

   she thought he looked quite as nice
when he was cross as when he was pleased
the pucker on his forehead was most attrac-
tive  but she didnt tell him so

   some years back in our fathers and
grandfathers times there might have been
as many williams as marys but not now
william is almost as extinct as the dodo
while mary has stuck

   i have known said she  and do
know twenty williams can you produce
the same number of marys  

    certainly i can and a jolly sight more
me fished out a pencil and an old envelope
from his pockets and began to scribble
 ill write down every d-ahem-blessed

mary ive ever met---

   but how shall i know you are not
inventing them   she demanded a little
aggravatingly

   oh of course if im a liar-- he

jumped up with such force that his chair
toppled back among the palms and she had
much ado to restrain her laughter

   dont be stupid bill im sorry- i
shouldnt have said that she laid a
soothing hand on his irate arm  pleas
forgive me

  for an instant he stood with all his
heckles erect then gradually they re-
laxed and after a cautious survey of the
conservatory he stooped a little shame-
facedly and kissed her

   dont you think we arc rather asses to
quarrel about such a trifle darling   he
picked up the chair and placed it close to
hers

   im sure of it

   its ail that damned-excuse me
mary but it is damned daily mail that
wretched rag is responsible for more

trouble-

   not on this occa-sion she interrupted
 for the first time in my life i feel really
grateful to it but for that a to z
article written by  forget whom and
inserted by the daily mail i dont believe

i	should be alive now to tell the tale
insomnia was playing havoc with me-
reaction i suppose after all the hideous
welter i had been in over there  a white
little bed in a peaceful room was too much

for me -

   dont dearest he whispered  dont
lets think of those unspeakable days i
try only to dwell on my extraordinary

luck to be here at all with life before
and you   his big hand closed
hers as though he meant never to let
of it  and do you mean to tell inc
said presently  that this name bi
has really helped you to sleep  

  she nodded  never failed i blesm
writer of the  a to z  article every
of my life i feel wide awake when 
to bed and as though i should be
awake for the remainder of my life
begin on-say-alfred as a matter
fact  know very few alfreds for which
grateful i dislike the name so i
leave him and jump perhaps to the

   john i suppose or jane    j
 both but chiefly john john k
proved almost as fruitful as william- 
generally sound asleep before im
through him i know heaps of ja 
johnnies and jacks i go back to tb
childish days in the country and old
the fisherman jumps to my mind or jol
the swearing blacksmith last right
john joined the old ones-young lieu
judson-i heard his sister when 
the baxters call him  jacky dear 
quite excited and before i could
myself i said aloud   that makes n 
teen   and everybody stared at tne 
of course i couldnt explain

 bill chuckled	j

   then percy is rather a good
  it but i know

                         seven

you wouldnt think
and eight archies and
and eleven dorothys and seveojp
annies  but of course no name
anywhere near william its just as c
mon as dirt-oh im sorry dear i fotsj

   dont apologise i dont mind i j
besides i still stick to it it is a uniqe ur
aristocratic name compared with 
and ill prove it now ill have  
with you if yon can prove you
more williams than i know marys
give you a pearl necklace what do j
think of that  

 a very pleasing offer	

   and if i can prove i know more 
than you know williams you must 
roe-let me see a motor car

  we will give ourselves a week slowly

so to speak and to put it mildly
led over they pitted her and
pitied her parents though the said

to  stick it  so long  and above all
pitied diu chevening lovely and sweet
charming though mary undoubtedly

mabel barnes-grundy

  her old friends the buckmasters were
most affected by what they called her
sudden strange and inexplicable behaviour

   helen the eldest girl and marys special
friend was really distressed they met
at a bridge tournament a few days after
the bet had been made a tournament
organised by a lady rowther in aid of st
dunstans hostel and run on the lines of
the old-fashioned whist drive where a hand
is played at each table and the winning
couple moves either up or down

  mary played bridge well her father a
tine player himself had insisted upon her
learning young a girl must be useful
besides ornamental he opined  and when
an attack of gout or some other unfortunate
contingent prevented him from going to
his club for his usual game she would prove
useful at home to make up a four she
was a dashing and at the same time a
cautious and reliable player and won a good
deal more than she lost but to-day   
one choleric old gentleman nearly threw
his cards at her on her letting him down
five tricks doubled by their opponents and
redoubled by herself

  when she entered the large room and
saw the vast array of tables play was to be
for three hours with an extra half-hour for
tea she commented to helen with delight
on the size of the tournament

  what a splendid lot of tables she
whispered with a suppressed air of excite-
ment and what a lovely lot of men  i
am glad

  helen stared at her mary though most
attractive to the opposite sex had never
been very keen on men-said they were
always too full of themselves  old men
were too prosy and held forth young men
appeared to regard themselves as the per-
petual hope of the daughters and despair
of the mothers and all of them went bald

   i hope we shall play very quickly and
i shall meet heaps of different ones i

wonder if any of them are called wil-

i mean she stammered catching sight
of helens amazed face  arc-are good
players 

    i expect so said helen a little coldly
while suddenly feeling sorry for bill

   i like men you know who play well
said mary a trifle vacuously

     naturally returned helen but mary
did not seem to hear her with eagerness
she was examining all the male competitor
in the room and helen wished she wouldnt
several were returning her gaze with in-
terest and unconcealed nleasure for site
was looking unusually lovely with her




hutchinsons story magazine

flushed cheelcs and eyes dark with excite-
ment

  the two girls started at the same table
marys partner was a stoutish elderly man
with a weather-beaten look an admiral
bpntiy and helens a young artillery
officer

  mary won the cut slie started oft with
a  two no trumps her partner who
had been informed by lady rowthcr he
had drawn one of the finest lady players
in the room felt his heart give a little
pleasurable tlmmp mingled with admira-
tion for her dash and beauty but his own
hftnd containing seven diamonds to the
queen ten and he rest rubbish he took her
out into three of his suit prompty she
took him back into  three no trumps
was doubled on the left and when he firmly
announced  five diamonds he nearly had
a stroke when she proclaimed calmly
 four no trumps  and was again doubled
had he been on his late ship the paint
around would undoubtedly liave blistered
when she went down four tricks and he dis-
covered shed had but one diamond in her
own hand and the ace at that but he
controlled his temper and on her repeating
absent-mindedly-she seemed wholly en-
gaged in watching the initialing of her
score by the young captain-that shed
held fotir aces he merely called hcr atten-
tion to the fact that four aces could by no
possible means or chicanery yield tnore
than four tricks and she must agree with
him which she promptly did whilst leaning
across the table and entreating the young
captain to tell her for what his initials
f w stood as she was intensely interested
in names and when he replied   frank
wilraot she merely stghed with a little
air of disappointment whilst utterly ignor-
ing the amazed looks of helen

   indeed as helen said afterwards
when relating the story to her sisters stella
and elizalxsth  she entirely ignored me
for the rest of the afternoon i never
met her again but was often near enough
to see her extraordinary play which was
so rapid you could scarcely follow the
cards and hear what she said to both her
partners and opponents always was she
on the same tack her interest in christian
names and always with the same charming
and disarming smile no one could resist
her she looked bo lovely too im sure
hall the men in the room-her opponents-
were in love with her especially as she
presented through her  arc less and rapid
play two out of every three of them with
hundreds above the lint while the other

half her partners regarded her as s

   once her voice came ringing across

really  how interesting i always t
it one of the finest and manliest of n
since-since william the conqueror
and took possession of our dear is
dont you   and the man who owned

astonished to speak 

   i dont wonder she must be m
stella who spoke was the most pr
of the buclcmaster sisters a nice
girl who always aired her clothes sep
on different chairs when she went to

who was sitting by her and drinkings
her every word with his own innocuousijgpt

   it has been my privi-
 lege to act as teacher
 and co u n se llor to
 thousands of ambitious
 men and women- from
 the heads of large com-
 panies to the most
 humble beginner in the
 ranks

   and  have condudcd
 that the average man
 engaged in a urge en
 terprise who has not
 yet applied efficiency
 methods to his work
 has been losing from
   a yeat
 -while the professional
 or industrial worker has
 probably been losing
 from  to  a
 year

   for twenty years i
 have been studying at
 close range the exact
 reason s for these
 peoples failure to get
 ahead and into my
 new practical course ia
 personal efficiency i
 have put in compact
 lorm the result of
 this study of indivi-

the seven lessons

give you the essence of efficient living and
business achievement they teach you in
a few pleasant evenings of study

  how to measure your efficiency

  how to get ahead

  how to keep well

  how to improva your finances

  how to organise your work

  how to be efficient at home

  how to plan your life

  by showing you in my lessons what other
men and women-just like yourself-have
learned and done and been i believe sincerely
that  can save you about ten years of costly
experiment anti moreover can show you how
to use your strength energy and special
abilities in a way which will certainly bring
you success

  efficiency is nothing less than the difference
between wealth and poverty fame and ob-
scurity power and weakness health and
disease growth and death hope and despair
the step from one of these extremes to the
other is a short and easy one-if you know
how

  take one of my pupils whom i shall call
mr x because if  over met an unknown
quantity he was one when he first came
to me

  he has increased by about  per ccnt
his daily output of work his optimism and
will power his health reserve and his financial
resources

  how did he do it 

  first he analysed himself have you ever
done this-thoroughly if not try doing so
now

  i	can tell you i never saw such a change
in a man

  for the first time he knew what he wanted
to do what he wanted to be what he wanted
to have in life

  then he went boldly at the attainment 
his ambition

  he studied his possibilities - physical
mental and spiritual he learned that his
ambitions lay witbin reach of his natural
gifts

  finding that he was out of gear in ceritin
ways-he set out to repair his faulty machinery
he made the most of his job he learned
to save two hours a day he talked with
men in higher positions

  ho studied and tried every conceivable
way of improving his work he was away
planning his liite of advattce every open

ing higher up found him prepared to a
ably

  he changed his habits of living and inc
his daily output of energy about  per

  he stopped being a pessimist and gr
and became the most cheerful man in
whole organisation having grown -
friendly he attracted a host of new f
he prospered he advanced he t
a leader he developed courage

  but remember this mr x was not
exceptional man by any means he
just average to begin with when i first 
him he was making  a week to-d
is probably without a rival in his chosen
-and his name is known throughout 
business world you -can do the san
better

 ive noticed that said stella-a
 bp of expectant eager look in her eyes
 she meets people especially men

  and she goes rushing about from place
  place house to house to luncheons teas
 jnners balls suppers she makes me think
  a midge spinning in the evening air or

 bglfcting mouse with its cage on fire-

 sfo broke ofl abruptly as mary herself
 hbly opened the door

 i you have been talking about me she
 at the threshold of the room whilst
 wscaiined each guilty face

 they said nothing

 	and-if i did not know you loved me
 mffrftold surmise you were saying nasty
 about me

     never   they cried together

 yy sat down in a big chair and sut-
 jvd them with quizzical eyes a bright
 j t colour burnt on each cheek and she
 d wonderfully pretty in spite of
 fes of fatigue beneath her eyes

 l  wh-it was it  youve known me all

 	we i love you helen-youre one of
 decentest things  know and im quite
 ibp  yon stella and elizabeth  laugh-

  nah at men  

 said helen with some heat
 ifte other day at the bridge tourna-

l t  was only trying to meet wil--

i mean-oh  cant explain

     udlenly she fell into laughter at the
vi  l  on their f- and she laughed
that not only did she weep but

mabel barnes-grundy

 course it was the result of the last two
 years terrible experience    but there
 were good doctors fine brain specialists
 hypnotists whose aid   

  mary with a tremendous effort pulled
herself together and sat up straight whilst
she wiped her eyes

 you must trust me girls she said
 im quite sane though i may not appear
to be i believe you are going to the
willoughbys dance to-morrow night  
they nodded

    well at twelve oclock just as cinder-
ella reverted to her drab little life and her
plare by the fire i shall revert to ray usual
well-behaved manner and no longer be-
what was it -restless excitable hectic
and keen upon any man but bill mean-
while i want your help thats what i
came for im at a loose end ive no
engagement for to-day and i want one
can any of you help me take me anywhere
with you  

   stella and elizabeth shook their heads
 im going to a bazaar of all ante-
diluvian god-forsaken entertainments
said helen

    the one at the empress rooms in which
your aunt is interested  

    right and it is to be enlivened with
all sorts of up-to-date side shows jazz
teas a concert by ruhleben prisoners and
the usual old-fashioned fortune telling

raffles---

    the very thing i  ecstatically miry
leapt to hcr feet and clapped her hands
 its absolutely providential-raffling
ill raffle what shall i wear   know
your aunt will let me rafllc all her best
sofa cushions and objeti dart i must fly
home to luncheon aud to dress thank

foil so much for letting me go with you
leleo darling ill be there on the stroll
of three ta-ta dears   and she was gone
like a lightning whirlwind before tho
sisters could draw breath

               hi

   if helen had been amazed and somewhat
distressed at marys behaviour at the
bridge tournament it caused her real
anguish at the bazaar  and a thousand
times she wished she had never brought
her

   for hours she watched her flitting about
the room a radiant figure in dafiodil
yellow her eyes sparkling her whole face

alight with excitement as she raked in
innumerable half-crowns ten-shilling and
one-pound notes for hr raffles  and she


hutchinsons story magazine

was filled with shame when she noted that
it was always the men who were her quarry

  that mary the well-bred refined and
almost puritan mary should so behave 
she was not common helen told herself
when once again unknown to mary who
was too absorbed in her task to observe
her helen remained close at hand to listen
to her remarks to a fresh victim she was
not vulgar not cheap she was not even
coquettish but in her bearing towards
the men there was an eagerness a delight
at securing their patronage so noticeable
that the least vain among them must have
been secretly flattered

   two tickets  thank you so much it
 a lovely cushion isnt it   as a matter
of fact it was a cubist monstrosity  and
your name and address please in case you
should be gone w hen ue raffle takes place
no not your initials your full name please
so that there shall be no mistake aubrey

- disappointment clearly descernible

in the pretty voice or occasionally a
sudden note of delight of triumph a look of
gratitude flashed up into the fishy eyes of
some podgy elderly man who was obviously
much more interested in the attractive
creature confronting him than in the
cushion she carried   

   why this occasional pleasure and
excitement   helen asked herlf re-
peatedly  what did it mean   then in
a flash illumination came it was the
name of william the joyousness and
triumph appeared when some male creature
answered to the name of william helen
gasped at the realisation of this could it
be possible  mary was so much in love
that like a small child who adores the
repetition of a story that pleases it she was
made happy bv merely meeting a man of
the same name as her fiance

  its mania said helen to herself

 a bad form of mania i must get her
home poor poor mary

  she advanced with rapid steps to the
girl who was now smiling into the eyes of a
bemused bewitched young naval lieutenant
as though he were the loveliest thing on
earth  and taking her gently hut firmly
by the ami whispered that she must come
home

   come home  

   yes at once 

   but why  

   because i say it helen might have
been addressing a naughty child

   i shant said mary

   you wont  

  no im having a lovely time and i

shall remain till the bazaar closes your 
aunt says im the best raffler here and
isnt it jolly helen   she lowered j
voice  this young lieutenant is called

william-

   helen fled

  the hands of the willoughbys fine
sevres clock on the mantelshelf of fhe
drawing room which had been cleared w 
dancing pointed to 

   the dance was in full swing dozens of i
couples performed queer antics with tbr 
legs and arms sometimes together soflis
times opposite sometimes at each other
side or round the corner or at opposite
ends of the room or back to back wbw
they called dancing

   bill was performing with helen steb
with bills cousin harry the only soil
the house mary was nowhere to be seen
and just because she was not there t
room to bill seemed a dull and lonely placej
 how topping mary looks to-nigh j j
never saw her look better he voicfl 
his conviction aloud

  yes agreed helen	 

    she reminds me of spring incarnate- 
then after the manner of the phlegm
briton he blushed at liis own ratbnq
 mary has not seemed herself the 
few days though she appears better tr
night said helen a little nervously-  

    oh   bills voice contained surpn

 in what way  

   havent you noticed it  	 u 

    well to tell you the truth i bav
seen much of her i-ive been busy-
he changed the subject and helen did
pursue it bat she wondered   - a l
scented a mystery 	

  mary as a matter of fact had cut  j
dance with a very boring and pompj
man with a monocle who remark 
 rear-ly   in a tired voice to the 

 rdinary observation and she was hi
away in a recess in the library witbho
small daughter of the house aged ten
graciously accepted her a a relation-t
for the sake of her  dear darling
bill  who never treated her as a little 
or  talked down to her	j 

    you dont mind sitting out with ne  
inquired the child  you ee
will never think of looking for me her
make me go to bed and she ll
after a bit shes a bad memory-

ed list of the forty-two   

  shewas aroused from her reverie by the

as fast as her legs would carry her
leaving a most astonished little girl behind
her

   forty-two  forty-two  how extra-
ordinary  all my work in vain and only
ten minutes left she said to herself over
and over again  its too too bad oh
where are the men  arc they ail dancing 
is there not a william anywhere at large  
in her anguish she almost wrung her hands
as she leant with her back to the wall her
eyes now searching tbe kaleidoscopic scene
before her and then the clock on the
mantelshelf while her cheeks flushed and
paled as the minutes passed and the blood
drummed in her ears a charming figure
she presented in her gown of exquisite
jade green her golden head pushed a little
forward in her tense excitement her hands
clasped before her  and bill who was now
performing a duty dance with a friend of
the buckmasters and who unknown ui
mary was devouring her with eyes of love
and admiration had much ado to restrain
himself from alandoning his partner and
finishing the dance with mary

 then-and in the maze of whirling
moving figures bill had been swallowed up
-a miracle occurred as miracles do occur
in spite of what all the practical level-
headed stodgy people may say to the
contrary and a little shiver of exultation
and delight ran up and down marys spine
for across the room a mans voice pro-
claimed in accents of pleasure  why
theres willie  hes come after all i 

  and so he had he had arrived in time
to save her she knew it she knew it as
surely as she knew the sun would rise
to-morrow

  he stood in the doorway a fine hand-
some upstanding figure of a man and as
mary looked at him he looked at her
she always emphatically denies that she
gave him what bill coarsely describes as
 the glad eye and we believe her but
the fact remains the stranger immediately
crossed the room to where she stood bowed
low before her and craved the honour of a
dance

   with pleasure  said she with a dazzling
smile  but first will you write your name
on my programme wrill you be so kind t
i like to know the name of the person with
whom i am dancing she spoke rapidly

a partnership memory

by alice hegan rice

jlulhor of  xcru wiggi of the cabhage patch

there was but one
bond of sym-
pathy that could
exist between the two
men yet neither seemed
willing to be the first
to allude to the subject
uppermost in the mind
of each they had
been playing chess in
the captains state-
room the better part of
a long dull afternoon
through the open door
the sea stretched grey
and passive and the
decks were wet with an intermittent
drizzle of rain

  it was richards who first opened the way
to mutual confidences 

   do you remember the last time we
played chess in this room captain   he
asked replacing the pawns in the box with
fastidious precision

   on your last crossing i suppose said
the captain casually  ten or was it
eleven years ago  

   eleven years in june  a white night
full of stars  and the coast lights of china
just glimmering on the horizon a certain
fair ladys last night on board and you
and i playing for the privilege of sharing
it with her

   oh  you mean nma starling   the
captain looked up quizzically  i ought
to remember  i won

   yes you won admitted richards

   that sounds very much like a sigh of

regret in the light of recent inru
it ought to be a sigh of exultation jf
 recent events might not have occtt
had i had that last inning	j

  the captain laid a heavy bronzed
on his shoulder  my dear fellow if
the fates wffre kind to a man they
you that night you and nina
had met for your mutual destruction 
was shoved in for a ixifier i azr
deny that i was as hard hit as you 
only i was used to it id 
before

   not by mrs starling  

   no not by kina starling	nt

  for some moments the two sat sf
smoking the captain a bluff hand- 
man of f-ttv-five his companion a -g
years his junior slender austere
the uniform of a major in the l 
states army the ashes of an
mance thus stirred evidently rfvt

ome live embers by the light of which
h was travelling back through the years
the captain was the first to recover
 the dinercnce between us was
at you went into it blindfolded and i
 in with my eyes open id known
tea ever since she was a youngster they
in honolulu you know and  took
r wot her over the first trip i was in com-
r an awful tool she was too  neg-
the girl shamefully until she dis-
vered that she was a winning card then
played her up for all she was worth
 ou know starling  

jfever saw him he only lived a
rope of years after they were married
 fact i never saw nina again until she
on her way back to honolulu with her
peak  n tc vcr  which you

 poor little bobby  you know his
ic end  

    oh yes the papers were full of it
tea had about as much business with a
i a cleopatra 

yet she adored the boy
gqh yes he was her one permanent
the rest of us were transients
entertained us royally when we came
r promptly forgot us when we departed

  was pretty rum that in the end she
ld have been bobs undoing but
a she was everybodys undoing that
 came in contact with

lon the contrary richards said  we
her undoing we asked too much of
  we demanded the impossible and

   tricc to ive jt  

 l captain shook his head  she is
cwale of the species he contended
u after what she wants and if
j cannot reach it by a straight course
takes a crooked one you would
wbuy  it fmeas
yjchards considered his slender well-
ep hands gravely  i think f should
 the instinct of acquiescence she is
ure ol sudden fire with a passionate
he    he thing required of her for
klpevi -he loves regardless of circmn-
vjrnr i-ife confuses and battles her i
j  he is politic and perhaps not always
ward bnt her motive is never
	 always trying to get

uni  somebody else you must
ig that she is the most exquisitely
 lla person you ever knew 
to  i tl admit anything good you want
vj y about her  the lord ki iovts she
ho to  hen she came back to
lu to uve after her second marriage

she used to slip down to the dock wheu-
ever i made the port i can see her now
as smart as a little white yacht under full
sail pretending to be interested in the
arriving passengers when all the time she
was wirelessing me on the bridge to hurry
up that her motor was waiting and that i
was to take lunch with her by george 
that girl could say more with her eyes and
one finger than most women can say with
their tongues

   were you ever in her home  

   many a time they had a wonderful
place down below waikiki-white beach
blue sea and palms-you know the kind
of thing honolulu specialises in well
she would treat me like a grand mogul
nothing too good for me she remem-
bered the things i liked to eat and the land
of cigars i liked to smoke she gave me
a taste of what a real home can be and
when my time was up shed run me down
to the dock herself and give me a god-
speed that would keep me warmed up for
days to come i tell you a man has to
live at sea half his life to know what a thing
like that means

    but the baron  asked richards
 from what  have heard of the gentle-
man he was not one to give his wife free
rein

   oh von stern man liked men to admire
nina it gave him the satisfaction of
knowing that he possessed what others
wanted and nina never teased him
shed lie to him to be sure and get him
out of the way at times but that was only
to bring about more comfortable results
she wanted him to be happy too that
was her religion  she wanted everybody
to be happy

   i suppose i was the exception that
proved the rule said richards grimly

 the only cruel thing i ever knew her to
do was to keep me dangling between heaven
and hell from san francisco to  long-kong
and then to marry the baron as soon as
she got to germany

   well von stemman happened to be
on the spot when she landed you see
you anti i had made it rather an exciting
voyage for her ladyship when we dropped
out life became too dull she could not
bear to be out of a job

    i did not drop out rirhards pro-
tested  if i hadnt been under order
to report in the philippine the devil him-
self couldnt have stopped me that was
what i wanted to tell her that last night
on board  as it was  lost my chance i
had to catch a steamer early the next


hutchinsons story magazine

morning for manila our letters miscarried
and she married the baron

  there was a long pause while richards
lit a fresh cigarette and the captain idly
lingered tha chessmen it was not a pause
of finality however  it was but a halt on
the brink of the subject during which each
looked back on the past through his own
particular vista

   did she seem to care about von stern-
man   richards brought out at last

   well its hard to say she made up to
him flattered him spoiled him and fooled
him whenever it pleased her to of course
she was inordinately proud of his position
and his brains he was a brilliant man
but hard as tacks she spent a good
part of her time explaining away his rude-
nesses

   yes said richards with the absent
eyes and slightly pursed lips  i can see
her in the role she had a gift for inter-
preting her friends to the world she
accorded herself the privilege of making
the translation not too literal and the
result was always more charming than the
original

     in this case it couldnt have been worse
the baron with all his good looks and
grand air was a boor i think nina
secretly feared him

   feared him   richards looked up
sharply

    yes at heart i think she always feared
him he had all a germans ideas about
women and if he had ever caught her in
one of her escapades it would have gone
hard with her in fact i think that was
just what did happen in the end

   what happened said richards bit-
terly  was that he made her the tool for
his dirty work what the poor girl has
suffered during these past few years is
something i dont like to think of

   nor i agreed the captain  i did
all i could for her when war was de-
clared in  she was all in a flutter to
get back to the states she offered a dozen
excuses  von stern man was ill with malaria
and had to get away from the islands 
she wanted to see her people bob wanted
to enter a military school etc there
wasnt an extra stateroom on board but 
turned out of my cabin for them i let
that big scoundrel of a german have my
bed all bccause nina asked me to and
ten days after he landed in san francisco
he forged a passport and got away to
europe

    yes said richards  it was not laiig
after that that i saw mrs starling jhr

will always be  mrs starling  to me we
met in a new york hotel in an elevator-
it was the first time id seen her since
left this steamer seven years before vet
you would have thought we had not been
parted twenty-four hours she took ne
right into hex confidence and poured ou
all her troubles

   about the baron  

   no about bob it seems he had
his heart on going to west point he had
worked for years toward that end h
appointment was all but secured when the
barons departure became known and the
whole affair was trembling in the balance
bob was beside himself with rage and d
appointment and mrs starling had beef
moving heaven and earth to get him w
hearts desire i went up to their apa
ment and thrashed out the whole matte
with them bob was a stunning chap-
built for the army every inch of him b
was too loyal to his mother to expr
himself openly concerning the baron b
i never saw more concentrated hatr
than he showed in his face every time h
name was mentioned i remember ho
he paced the floor declaring that it wasn
fair for his life to be smashed like that-
that if he failed to get the appointment 
would be a blot on his character he cou
never live down and mrs starling
as a sheet kept saying  you are going
get it bob i got you into this and i
going to get you out of it the major afl
f will arrange some way 

   and major did   the captain thr
in sarcastically	-

   no she did it herself though of
i pulled a few wires in the war depy
ment and introduced her to senator
upon whose decision the whole matl
hinged it was a difficult tiling to arraflsy
for he refused point-blank to give a
sonal interview as he was leaving 
in a couple of hoars	m

	wager nina got the interview

   well as a matter of fact she did- -
talked with her for an hour then asked 
to lunch with him when t called at
apartment ui the afternoon bob toki
senator gray had thought it best for 
to go down to washington with hu
clinch the matter

   so that was how bob got his
ion   the captain leaned back -k
chair and smiled  there is nobody 
her shes so frail and yielding  w
 irresistible it isnt merely her be 
ive seen a dozen women i though 
prettier its something more to


a blind man would feel you say she has
ot changed much  

    well i suppose she has richards ad-
mitted   her figure perhaps more than
m pouring

   naturally a clever woman finds it
jasier to camouflage her complexion than
camouflage her figure

    she cant change the colour of her
ty said richards coolly
r  those ridiculously blue eyes   the
aptain laughed  i used to get an
tu lri shock every time i looked into
em after all i think that is ninas
charm she is so terrifically aware of
you-that is when she isnt aware of some
ne else

 it is we who arc aware urged richards
you know those lines  the innocent
that nothing does but shine moves
 the slumbering surges of the world
 starling is like a radiant lighthouse
rainst which poor befuddled gulls beat
their brains

   heres one wise old eagle that didnt  
he captain chuckled  a lighthouse
keep of the rocks to me and you
  have she is the only woman  was
afraid of in my life but you were
iv  me of her mission to washington
i you see her again  

    no i was down on the border that
ytr but i heard of her she took a
js at west point to be near bob and
jear she had the whole ist crazy about

    yes i shouldnt wonder if that was
qtlleason ot honour  all the

i	 cadets were probably wasting their
 flirting with his mother
i his mother was doing everything in
power for him said richards stiffly 
r ambition was as gtcat as his
jj oh i wouldnt call it ambition on her
ef shc ilst wanted bob to have what

	wanted if he had set his heart on
a burglar she would have helped him
  just the same what did the officers
to think of bob  
tll cre was but one thing to thiuk i
riyn- bob starling was every thing a
ljler ought to be one of the instructors
jr me he was considered the most pro-
r man that had passed through the
oinv jn yean that was the tragedy

tjj and when did the complication with

from the first the letters dated from 
but it was not until after we went into the
war that things began to leak out you
see the letters were not in code or anything
of that kind  they would have passed with-
out suspicion anywhere all mrs starling
did was to forward them to the german
ambassador who was an old friend of von
sternmans how could she know that
they contained secret information  

   she probably didnt agreed the cap-
tain  but it must have struck her as
strange that her husband should ask her to
send his private letters to her containing
nothing whatever of an official nature to
the german embassy at washington

  richards face flushed   i did not rea-
lise that i was discussing mrs starling with
one of her enemies i took it for granted
that you shared my belief in her innocence

   nina innocent  why i can as soon
think of methuselah being young  my
dear man you do her an injustice

   the court evidently shared my
opinion said richards  no stones were
left unturned by the prosecuting attorney
to convict her of conspiracy everything
was against hcr-the fact that wc had just
gone into the war  that public opinion
was flaming against any evidence of pro-
germanism  that she did not deny having
forwarded the letters yet she was com-
pletely exonerated

   do you wonder   asked captain
sherry  i knew it was all up with the
jury when  saw shc was going to conduct
her own case  the beautiful baroness
von sternman a loyal american citizen
made the tool of her unscrupulous german
husband  i can see the headlines now
 ve got a copy of one of the papers around
here somewhere it had a picture of nina
pleading her cause and the judge and jury
in tears i kept it because it was a rather
good likeness of her perhaps i can find
it

  he opened a desk drawer and after some
fumbling took out a newspaper clipping
carefully protected between cardboards
the two men looked at the picture for
some moments in silence and one of them
smiled with bis eyes aud one of them
smiled with his lips the captain was the
first to speak

   perfect stage setting he said  be-
lasco could not have done better and a
situation worthy of ninas genius cant
you see her now taking in the whole
bunch right down to the case-hardened
reporters

   and you alone refuse her even the
hutchinsons story magazine

benefit of a doubt   exclaimed richards
hotly  i should think the fact that she
brought divorce proceedings against von
sternman the moment she discovered the
truth would ijc sufficient guarantee of her
innocenco

  captain sherrys eves twinkled  a
superb coup de grace  nothing could have
climaxed the situation so dramatically and
so convincingly it satisfied everybody
apparently but uncle sam unfortu-
nately he is less susceptible to feminine
charms than other men even though he
lot her off he decided that he did not want
an officer in bis army whose step-father
was on the kaisers staff and whose mother
had been tried for a germau spy  un-
derstand that everything possible was done
at west point to let bob down easy but
you cant pitch a man out of a window
without breaking something

   in this case it was the boys heart
said richards  it happened in may you
see and he was to have been graduated in
june you would have needed to know
him in recent years to understand just what
it meant to him an honour man for three
consecutive years and patriotic to his finger
tips  dont blame him for doing what he
did id have done it in his place

   a rotten business sighed the cap-
tain  i have forgotten the details it
was nina who found him wasnt it  

   yes she got back to west point the
night it happened went to his room and
found him still in his uniform with a bullet
through his heart and beside him a small
american flag on which was written  for
my country

  i hey sat silent cach closeted in his owo 
reflections then richards said 

   such a tragedy wonld have crushed 
woman of coarser fibre but mrs starling
bent to it like a flower in a hurricane sh 
felt the beauty of his death and the per- 
fection of his sacrifice just as she felt von 
sternmans position and what he did for
his country her letter to me at th j
time was one of the noblest things i ever i
read she did not blame anybody there
was no bitterness nor rebellion nor re 
crimination only the most exquisite un 
derstanding and acquiescence she has 

wonderful soul a-

  then realising how warmly he was
speaking he rose abruptly and pushed
back his chair

   after all its a subject upon which yt
and i could never agree we have bee
foolish to discuss it

   not at all said the captain  
have passed a very pleasant afternoon
the way i suppose of course you kno
that she has married again

  richards stopped abruptly in the door- j
way  mrs starling married   he re- j
peated dully

   yes  saw it in a german paper j
hong-kong last month she managed 
get over to berlin by way of sotrfjsl
america shipped as a stewardess on 
german boat and re-entered the ranks 
the german nobility	

   you dont mean that she has married 
another baron   asked richards agha- 
captain sherrys bluff laugh rang
heartily  oh lord no   he said

have been considerably intrigued in her
management of the menagerie and her
guests had it not been for a ccrtain dis-
covery of her own-that is of her secretary
miriam grey

   she had found miss grey in a hotel in one
of the foreign watering-places which mrs
armytage frequented  the girl bad bo-
come suddenly an orphan and like many
another orphan had been left penniless by
her father one of those charming parents
who demonstrate their complete confidence
in providence by leaving their children en-
tirely to its care it was the sort of case
to appeal to mrs armytage who when
miriam grey declined to acccpt charity
promptly suggested that the girl should
come to her as her secretary the arrange-
ment proved eminently satisfactory  and
miss grey soon got tlio menagerie in hand
and ran it with a tact and skill which
astonished her employer-and herself

  miss grey managed the vast household
as if my magic  the servants-that superior
class which for mysterious reasons best
known to itself regards secretaries and
hutchinsons story magazine

governesses with ill-veiled contempt-not
only liked but actually obeyed her more-
over the guests  took to  and confided in
her  for shc was well posted up in their
icspcctivc claims to fame- she could talk
to the poet about his uttle book of verse
which was a matter of confidence between
him and his publishers  the inventor of a
wonderful gun which an incredulous war
office refused to believe was capable of
astroying an immense army by one shot
fonnd in her a sympathetic though
momenl arily horrified listener  while to
the soul-stirring revelations of the explorer
shc lent an ever-ready aud pretty ear
children and dogs adored hcr  so did the
young men guests who displayed great in-
genuity in contriving excuses for approach-
ing hcr she was a very pretty girl with
dark hair beautiful grey eyes and a smile
which had won more hearts than mrs
armytages

  notwithstanding her popularity miss
grey  kept hcr place as the butler said
approvingly  although she was always on
hand when she was wanted at other times
she sought the seclusion of the pretty
indeed luxurious bedroom and sitting-
room which mrs armytage had insisted
upon allotting to her  they were two of
the best rooms in the house and the sitting-
room opened on the south end of the
terrace

  on a certain morning in june mrs
armytage having knocked first-it was
noteworthy that something about mis
grey induced almost a punctilious courtesy
in everybodys treatment of her though
ueither by word look nor manner did the
girl make any claim to such regard-mrs
armytage having knocked bustled into the
room with a sheaf of letters in her hand

   oh good morning my dear she said
kissing miriam affectionately  how well
youre looking this morning and as cool
as a-a-

   cucumber is the usual word said
miriam with a smile the httlc smile which
transformed the usual gravity of her face
bewitchingly

   nothing of the sort my dear you
look like a beautiful lily in that pretty
white dress of routs miriam laughed
and held out her hands for the letters
 nothing particular this morning my
dear most of em begging letters as
usual oh yes  i am forgetting  there
u one it from reggl- davroant
miriam had lxen glancing at the letter
iid she looked up quickly and as quickly
down again a faint colour rising to her face

which was of that complexion we liken  
old ivory for lack of a better comparisc- 
 he writes and asks if he may come dow-
the letter is dated four days ago  i suppo j
he had forgotten to post it which would b

clever im afraid reggie doesnt get

her eyes still fixed on the letter

but we are quite full up arent we  th 
man who killed four lions with a walkifl 
stick ought to have gone  but he hasp k

said miss grey reluctantly

   oh but my dear i couldnt think l

nuisance to you sitting up half the nig 
smoking and hes always singing
whistling no i wont have you
turbed not even for reggie

   i dont think mr davenant will  j

      heres reggie-mr davenant-my
   uear ive just been warning him that
   ie  to keep as quiet as a mouse and not be

   	nuisance to you she turned as she
   p to set the curtain straight and
   therefore did not see the expression of
   tupefied amazement and fleeting joy which

upon the good-looking countenance of
gentleman who opened his mouth to
claim but shut it again in obedience to a
jjjght movement of the hand made by miss
crey

      how-how do you do miss grey  
    got out with difficulty   have
   promised mrs armytage that the pro-
   hial mouse will be a tornado of noise
   cfmpaxed with me ill be as good as gold 

   d  think its awfully nice of you-

   j this moment mrs armytage was
   ailed from the terrace by one of her
   numerous and exacting guests  and the
   stant she had gone out of car-shot the
   yung mans manner changed to one of
   perish eagerness  my dear miriam 

   wjjo would have thought- 

    miss grey would be more appro-
   priate she said in a low voice

    oh of course  all right   he re-
   pnded  but look here you know-
   his is so sudden  im knocked all of a
   heap when we last met at trouviue-

   	ay whats happened   he glanced at
   the black sash on her dainty frock the
   wack bow on her blouse

    my father died soon after you left i
   jund that i should have to earn my living

   	am earning it very pleasantly in a
   wrd mr davenant naturally i do not

      to be reminded of a past which has
   ne for ever

      but-- he began pleadingly

   	 no no she said earnestly  please
    us forget it everything has altered

  resides-

      i know what you mean he said
   quickly ruefully  you mean that there
   j oothing between us  that i have no right
   j presume on a mere friendship id hoped
   at tt would have been more-but you

  walnt let me speak-

i am glad i did not she said  we
pnt say any more you will he just one
the visitors  i-i cannot permit one of
 armytages guests to-to-propose
tne she flushed painfully i am

      i can rely on you-

 if you mean that  am not to make
e to you he said with a shake of his
r d  well ill try  but it will be prccious
d there  dont look at me like that

 ha

vnt i said i will be good  but look

here dash it all youre not going to treat
me as if i were one of the  menagerie one
of the dear old ladys freaks  youll let me
talk to you-well not exactly as i used
to try to do  but just let me tell you about
my troubles and scrapes and the rest of it
do you remember how i used to bore you 
theres something about you miri-miss
grey-which makes a man run to you for
help and advice as a bear makes for honey
youre got a sympathetic nature and-well
you understand angels are always beauti-
ful and ive an idea that the general run of
them are not what youd call clever while
you-beg pardon -id forgotten for the
moment-

   oh yes  you can tell me anything you
want to conceded miriam resignedly
 i hope tilings are going well with you  

   rotten he said laconically they
always are my people still regard me as
a black sheep and not a prize one at that
ive tried my hand at one or two things
but muffed them as usual you see i
hadnt you at hand to advise me-

  a neat ind demure housemaid put in an
appcarancc and miss grey said in her best
secretarial manner

   the niaid will show you your room mr
davenant lunch is at one-thirty

  regarding the servant more in sorrow
than in anger the young man took his
departure on entering the crowded
dining-room at lunch time he observed that
miss grey was seated at the bottom of the
table and was cheerfully marching to-
wards the chair next hers when a footman
intercepted and guided him to a seat beside
his hostess  and it says much for this
good-for-nothings command of counten-
ance and temper that he displayed no sign
of disappointment or chagrin but his face
wearing its pleasant smile at once set out
to charm and amuse his hostess hia re-
peated attempts during the afternoon to
approach miss grey proved as futile as
that at lunch and it was with rather a
rueful countenance that when he went into
the drawing-room after dinner clad in
what the old-fashioned novelist loved to
call  immaculate evening dress he found
miss grey seated in a corner and heavily
barricaded by several of the freaks who
appeared to be all talking at once to her
ivrforce he had to turn to his hostess who
blazing in rare and costly gems of various
colours was seated in an arm-chair and like
a keeper surveying her collection of curious
animals with bland complacency

   i say got em all on to-night aantie

and scintillating figure with a kind of
impudence which goodness knows why no
woman ever seemed to resent mrs armv-
tagc who liked him to call her  auntie
though they were in no way related patted
him on the arm and laughed as she replied
 oh not all my dear i think its very
bad taste to wear too much jewellery it
makes one conspicuous

    the court is with you he said gravely
 the few things youve got on to-night
just show em what you could do if you
liked is there anything new anything i
havent seen  

   im sure i dont know my dear she
said looking down upon her begemmed
bosom and arms  no i dont think so
oh yes i fancy this black pearl is new since
ou were down last she touched with
er fat finger a perfect and matchless pearl
wliich hung as a pendant to a thin chain
 i call it my nigger pearl a nice one
isnt it  

   stunning i  he responded  far and
away the best i have seen george i it
glows like a-like a hot coal where did
you pick that up  it must be worth quite
a pot of money  sort of  kings rausom 
they used to talk about

    yes  it did cost a great deal my dear
she admitted with a sigh of satisfaction
 i got it at that maharajahs sale-i never
can pronounce he mans name it is sup-
posed to be unique

   shouldnt wonder said reggie  by
the way isnt that rather a flimsy chain
youve got it on  looks to me an if the
slightest thing would break it if that pearl
were mine i should have it fixed to a
ships cable-until id pawned it

   do you know i was saying to mehham
my maid only this morning that this chain
was scarcely safe ill get a thicker one
itwould be a pity to lose thepearlshe said

   rather responded reggie absently
for at that moment the human barrier in
front of miss grey had thinned somewhat
and he sprang up and hurried towards the
breach but before lie could reach her a
little boy the child of a political polish
lady who had been banished from her
native country probably for that countrys
good ran across the room and flung him-
self at mira grey who immediately lifted
him to her lap and appeared to be so
absorbed in fondling him that she had no
attention tobcstowonmr reggie davenant
 look here he said at last in a low
and aggrieved voice  the kids hail his
innings ive listened to his innocent
prattle ive let him crease my slnrt-

front ive answered one hundred and
fifteen questions also hes ruined my
watch for life and pulled half the hairs out
of my moustache  dont you think its my
turn now  t ry for a few precious moment
to regard me as a little beast with long curl
and a blue velvet frock with roother-of
pearl buttons

   what do you want   asked miriam
still engrossed with the child

    if i were to tell you all i wanted i
said slowly and solemnly  it would take
about two days and a half no it wouldnt i
it would take about one minute-all right
all right ill behave  he declared hastily
in deprecation of the drawing together p
her brows wluch he recognised as a dange
signal  but i want to tell you something
something important ive got a letter to-
night- at this inauspicious momeo

a gentleman ivho had invented an ingehi
ously smoked glass for viewing cclipse
waddled towards them and was greeted with
miss greys usual smile of tolerance if not
encouragement

   oh da-dash-it all i  groaned
reggie  look here ill be on the terrac
at half-past ten to-morrow-dont say yo
wont come how do yon know i havent
invented a way of getting to tho moon
shot a double-headed elephant  you hav
to be a freak in this in fern-blessed liouso
to receive decent attention

   good evening bleated the inventof
of quaint astronomical instruments  my
i ak if you take any interest in solar phene
mona mr davenant  

   no said reggie bluntly  i tasted
it once and i didnt like it

   ah said the confused gentleman- 
 pity pity i-but i know miss grey dem-
and i should like to show her-

  reggie walked off with a frown on
generally smooth forehead and rage in h
usually blithesome heart

  the next morning at the appointed hof
he was on the terrace outside miriam
window  and after he had paced up anj
down half a dozen times she appeared lk
a vision of youthand beautyand better still-
womanly charm-so exquisite a vision tb i
reggie was able only to stand and ge 
her speechlessly for a full minute  j
 i cant work while you pace up

down like a wild beast- she began- 

    what else can you do in a menageri

 i consequence we often jump to

  jkiled to   them up correctly

  nd i determined that the thing for

fct -h a thing as that was possible for 
i tfi at unless i did know whom i could

i hviwaa about this time that i read an
bout dr blarkfnrd ooe of the lore-
v jaa ter analysts who was employed
  company at a record fee to select
ijpijyee i thought then that if

		business men paid such a salary

       order to insure their getting the
of workers there surely must in-
 totog n character reading for me

day my eye was attracted to an

announcement of a lecture on character
analysis by dr blackford and i decided to
go and see if i could learn anything

that lecture was an eye opener j not
only did dr blackford show how easy it is
to read at a glance the little signs that reveal
a persons character but after the lecture
she gave a remarkable demonstration of
character reading that amazed tbe audience

she asked the audience to select two
people in the hall to come up and be
analysed several men all of them entirely
unknown to her were suggested and finally
two were chosen as they came upon
the platform dr blackford looked them
over keenly and after a moments thought
began to analyse both of them at once as
she mentioned the characteristics of one she
described the corresponding characteristics
in the other

  beginning with generalities she told the
audience every one of whom seemed to
know both men that one was sociable
active bold and determined while the other
was more or less of a recluse very self-con-
tained quiet and gentle

  the first she said was brilliant clever
quick-witted and resourceful the second
a silent man slow and deliberate when he
spoke and relied upon calm mature judg-
ment rather than brilliant strokes of ingenuity
and wit

  the first man according to dr blackford
was active restless always on the go im-
patient and able to express himself only
in some resolute apgressive manner the
second man was studious plodding and con-
stant and expressed himself after prolonged
concentration and careful thought the fint
man the doctor said was therefore especially
equipped to execute plans to carry to success
any course of action but was not particu-
larly qualified to make plans or to map out
a cour-e of action -he could make practical
use of many different kind of knowledge
but did not have the patiencc or the
of concentration to search out and cl
the knowledge to that it could be ui
while he was a brilliant speaker a resource-
ful and effective debater he lacked the power

to dig out and assemble the material for
orations nnd debates the second man she
continued being shy and self-consciouscould
not speak in public but was a master of study
and research and strong in his ability to
classify and correlate all kinds of knowledge

  the first gentleman said dr blackford
 would be a remarkable success as a lawyer
especially in court practice the second
would also be a remarkable success as a
lawyer but his particular field would be the
preparation of cases and the giving of advicc
to clients therefore she went on  they
would be particularly fitted to work together
as partners not only because they comple-
ment each other professionally but because
their dispositions are such that they would
naturally admire and respect each other

  as she said this the audience broke into a
storm of applause and upon inquiry i learned
lhal the two men were indeed lawyers and
partners that they had been partners for
twenty years and were well known for their
intense affection for each other and for the
fact that during their twenty years partner-
ship they had never had a disagreement
one was the brilliant court lawyer the other
the student and adviser and as a tearn they
were remarkably successful

  when the lecture was over it didnt take
me long to get up to the platform and in-
quire as to how i could learn more about
character reading and i found that dr
blackford lud just completed a popular
course that explained the whole thing and
which would be sent on approval without
charge for examination i immediately
wrote the publishers and received the course
by return post

  and when it came i was never so amazed
in my life-for here was the whole secret in
seven fascinating lessons no hard study
no tiresome drudgery just interesting
pictures and simple directions that  couldnt
go wrong on

  why the very first lesson gave me hints
i could use right away and it was only a
matter of a few weeks before i was able at
one quick but careful survey to tell just what
a man was like by what he looked like

  and what a revelation it was i for the
first time i really knav people whom i
thought i had known for years it was ail

so simple now that it hardly seemed 
that i could have made such mistakes
did before i heard of dr blackford

  people took on a new interest insiei
of just ciphers each one became a defifl
personality with qualities tastes and trajj
which i was always able to  spot wjj
the very act of meeting people became
most fascinating pastime in the world a
how much more clearly my own characj
loomed up to me i know as never bef
my limitatidns and my capabilities

  but it has been in contact with peopwh
business that my new faculty has helped
most-to say that it has been worth hundred
of pounds to me is to put it mildly it jjjjj
enabled me to select a new partner who
proved the best help a man ever had-
has made it possible for us to build
probably the most efficient  frictionle 
organization in our line of business
every man in the right job-it has been 
means of my securing thousands of punlj
worth of business from men i had nev
been able to deal with because i hadfl
judged them correctly for after all bustfjj
relations depend more on knowing the
youre dealing with than any one thing
and what ive learned from ir budrfjj
lessons enables roc to know as much
a man the first time i meet him as his 
friend-sometimes more

  is it any wonder that many of the
enterprises have solicited dr blacktop
advice  or that thousands of heads of j
corporations salesmen engineers physic
bankers and educators have studied
course and say tliat the benefit derive
worth thousands of pounds to them

      rather have five minutes from

     -	here dont go   she had turned
  llc room  bog pardon  o lord
  nou scc i cant help it  

    nearly one minute gone observed
  m n  businesslike way

    righto  lets sit down on this seat
w worn out in a nutshell ive just had
chance offered me of joining this expedi-
ln to nairobi read about it  of
urs you have i is there anything you
nt know  its a good thing theres
tooey in it

   and are you going  im glad very
ad she said just a trifle too fervently
loh are you   he said eyeing her
cnnih  well im sorry to abate your
fjjasports of joy at the prospect of getting
of me but theres a little obstacle ive
frt to find a thousand pounds its like
p of those stories with a  catch  in it
nt it  my only way ol getting that
rosal sum of money is by committing
salary or highway robbery and by
jfrge im almost ready for either plan
p something tells me that this expedition
 going to turn out a winner  and ii it
ould and im in it i should be in a posi-

on to-to-

  there was no need for him to finish the
rtcnce the colour rose faintly to
jyiams face she avertel her eyes  but
partied she turned them again at a new
e in his voice and saw that his face had
fcfclenh i become haggard with the terrible

        a   p
     oh my dear you force me to make

	ike of it he said hoarsely  but if
    knew if you knew how much i love

   how hadlv i want you- miriam

trie that if i can join thus nairobi thing
prove myself-well not worthy of
but just worthy to kiss those little
of yours youd-you d give yourself
ttc and ill get that thousand pounds if
i had to commit murder
t  hash j she said anl her voice
jhed  thats one reason why i
mnt say it no no  

but her heart clamoured  ye yes 
reggie would have won this wonderful
j there and then if the polish kid had
appeared at that moment and ran at
at once engrossing miriams attention
 so saving-or spoiling-the situation
jpapgely enough though one would have
yttght an intelligent child would have
aware that he had not made a favour-
impression httle paulo displayed a
cat liking for the unsatisfied and irritated
t and reggie who at ordinary time

was fond ol children was compelled to
reciprocate the infants advances indeed
so fascinated was paulo on this occasion
that he deserted miss grey and insisted
upon his new friend accompanying him to
view the tomb of a kitten at whose obsequies
the infant had assisted in the early morning

  all things come to him who waits and
after dinner that evening reggie managed
to lure miriam into one of the aute-rooms
he looked as if he were suffering from sup-
pressed excitement his face was pale his
eyes bright at most times wete unduly
brilliant and unconsciously he gripped her
arm as he whispered

   miriam i think i sec a way to getting
that thousand it will be unpleasant it
will be dangerous but ill try it too much
depends-hold on  im not going to talk
to you again as i did this morning-too
much may depend on my getting it for me
to hesitate at the means oh dash my
hat he groaned  here comes that woman
who says we ought to eat the shell with the
egg-no mrs boggles i always leave the
shell seems to me as if it would look
greedy to eat the whole caboose and if
the egg-shells why not the egg-cup 
what   and so with a despairing glance
at miriam he made his escape

  miriam sat up in her bedroom ouite late
that night her hairfallingover her shoulders
her bauds clasped in her lap she was not
asking herself whether she loved reggie
davenant or not because she knew the
answer indeed she loved bim very
dearly  but she was not bhnd to the fact
that he was not perfect she wouldnt have
loved him if he had been she knew that
there were weaknesses in that charming
character  but she told herself as mil
women do that she could help to get rid
uf them yes he needed her  and a woman
loves to think that she is necessary to the
well-being of the men to whom she has given
her heart and oh  she had given the
whole of it to reggie  there was not a
little scrap left in her bosom in which there
woukl be a lamentable vacancy unless she
tilled it with that heart of hi she spent a
sleepless night

  in the morning at breakfast time
reggie announced with a cheerfulness
highly creditable to him that he had
promised to go for a drive with mrs army-
tage who was anxious that he should
confirm her decision to purchase a large
property in the neighbourhood  and he
was stul smiling as they were stwring
until he managed to catch miriams eyr
when the smile was repbeed by a lock l

such entreaty and longing that her hand
trembled as she arranged the light rug over
her patrons knees

  soon after the carriage had gone the
maid who attended on reggies bedroom
met miriam on the terrace

    oh miss greyshesaid  i wanted 
speak to you about mr davenants room

   what is the matter mary   asked
miriam with a smile  ha he been
breaking up the furniture  he has been
very quiet

    oh no miss replied mary promptly
and with a rather shocked air for like
most of her sex she had given her heart
iu a strictly proper sense in her case be it
understood to that ingratiating young
man who shc declared in the servants
hall was a perfeck gentleman and as hand-
some as any man had a right to be  oh
no indeed miss  but he will drop his cigar
and cigarette ash all over the place and
i thought if you would be so good as to let
me have an ash tray-not one of the usual
small ones but something as he couldnt

help seeing- oh thank you miss she

added as she turned away  and would
you mind locking his door as you come
out  master paulo is always running in
and out trying to find mr davcnant-so
fond he is of him and no wonder hes
got such a taking way with him

   yes  he has mary said miss grey
meekly

   she found a silver bowl in her room and
carried it in to mr davenanfs she was
there only a moment so to speak but when
she camo out her face was deathly white
and as shc turned the key in the door she
clung to the handle as if shc had been
overtaken by a sudden weakness she had
scarcely reached hcr own room when to
her surprise shc saw mrs armytages pony
phaeton driving up to the terrace

   oh my dear i  cried that lady  we
have had to come back ive remembered-
that is to say ive forgotten something

i wont be a minute reggie

    cant i get it whatever it is   asked
miriam in a dulled voice

   no no i wont trouble you dear 
replied mrs armytage and shc hurried
into the house

   miriam said reggie in a low voice
 this is a special mercv i want to tell vou
that i feel sure now that i can get that
money i shnll go up to town to-night
promise me that when i come back to say
good-bye you will give me five minutes

-what is the matter  you look pale

   before she could reply they were botb
startled by shrill cries of  miriam v
miriam i 

   that is mrs armytage  what
happened   murmured miriam

   one moment he pleaded

    no no she said agitatedly 
wants me-i must go

   she hurried into the house mrs arn
tage was standing on the top of the
staircase hcr face red her hands cluc
the bannister rail

    oh miriam come up at once i 
cried agitatedly

   miriam ran up the stairs and foil
mrs armytage into her dressing-room

   the secret

                       of being a

convincing talker

           how i learned it in one evening

          by george raymond

   have you heard the news about
   frank jordan  

-i j	this question quickly brought

little group which had gathered
entre of the office jordan and i had
eccd wiih the great extern machinery
ithin a month of each other four
eu go a year ago jordan was taken
 lnc accountants department and i was
ljj tt as traveller neither of us was
 with an unusual degree of brilliancy
made good in our new jobs well
q to keep them

my amazement tiien when 

just been made secretary of the

jj could hardly believe my ears but
jj r the  notice to employees  on
kice board telling about jordans good

i knew ihat jordan was a capable
v  quiet and unassuming but i never
a have selected him for any such sudden

    	knew too that the secretary of the
 eastern had to be a big man and i
ced how in the world jordau secured

gjjkiw

ktfirst chance  got  walked into
 s new office and after congratulating
silk rtnly  ked him to give me the
hi  f how he jumped ahead so quickly
 y s so intensely interesting that i
to repeat it as closely as  re-

 yu i ow l happened george
is you na imck p  point or two that

 s cp you

remember how seared  used to

	i-vcr i had to talk to the chief
 mber how you used lo tell me

v	folf  opened my mouth i put
    into it meaning of course that

every time i spoke i got into trouble you
remember when ralph sinton left to take
charge of the western office and i was
asked to present him with the silver cup
the boy gave him how flustered i was
and how i couldnt say a word because
there were people around  you remember
how confused i used to be every time
i met new people  couldnt say what i
wanted to say when  wanted to say it
and i determined that if there was any
possible cliarcc to learn how to talk  was
going to do it

  the first thing  did was to buy a
number of books on public speaking but
they seemed to be meant for those who
wanted to become orators whereas what 
wanted to learn was not only how to speak
in public but how to speak to individuals
under various conditions in business and
social life

  a few weeks later just as i was about
to give up hope of ever learning how to
talk interestingly  read an announcement
stating that lr frederick law had just
completed a new course in business talking
and public speaking entitled  mastery of
sjecch the course was offered on ap-
proval without money in advance so since
i had nothing whatever to lose by examining
the lessons  sent for them and in a few
days they arrived i glanced through the
entire eight lessons resding the headings
and a few paragraphs here and there and in
about an hour the whole secrct of effective
speaking was opened to me

  for example i learned why i had
always lacked confidence why talking had
always seemed something to be dreaded
whereas it is really the simplest thing in the
world to  get up and talk  i learned how
to secure complete attention to what i was
saying and how to make everything i said
interesting forceful and convincing 
 

advertisements

learned the art of listening the value of
silence and the power of brevity instead
of being funny at the wrong time i learned
how and when to use humour with telling
effect

  but perhaps the most wonderful part
of the lessons were tho actual examples of
what things to say and when to say them
to meet every condition i found that
there was a knack in making oral reports
to my superiors i found that there was
a right way and a wrong way to present
complaints to give estimates and to issue
orders

   i picked up some wonderful joints
about how to give my opinions about how
to answer complaints about how to ask
the bank for a loan about how to ask for
extensions another thing that struck me
forcibly was that instead of antagonising
people when i didnt agree with them i
learned how to bring them round to my
way of thinking in the most pleasant sort
of way then of course along with those
lessons there were chapters on speaking
before large audiences how to find material
for talking and speaking how to talk to
friends how to talk to servants and how
to talk to children

  why  got the secret the very first
evening and it was only a short time before
i was able to apply all of the principles and
found that my words were beginning to
have an almost magical effect upon every-
body to whom i spoke it seemed that
i got things done instantly whereas for-
merly as you know what i said went in
one ear and out the other i began to
acquire an executive ability that surprised
me i smoothed out difficulties like a true
diplomat in my talks with the chief i
spoke clearly simply convincingly then
came my first promotion since i entered the
accounting department i was given the
job of answering complaints and i made
good from that i was given the job of
making collections when mi buckley
joined the otficers training corps i was
made secretary between you and me
george my salary is now   a year
and i expect it will be more from the first
of the year

   and i want to tell you honestly that i

attribute my success solely to the fact
i learned how to talk to people

when jordan finished i asked hiffl 

  jjg

course and he gave it to me i sent h

 the address of the publishers of dr

and found it to be exactly as he had sta
after studying the eight simple le
began to seil to people who had p
refused to listen to me at all a
months of record-breaking sales during
dullest season of the year i received a
from the chief asking me to return to
city office we had quite a long ti 
which i explained how i was able to
sales records-and i was appointed
manager at almost twice my former

i	know that there was nothing in i
had changed except that i had 
the ability to talk where formerly i
used  words without reason i can
thank jordan enough for telling me
dr laws course in business talking
public speaking jordan and i are
spending all our spare time in making 
speeches on political subjects and j
is being talked about now as mayor

 and yet- she stopped her head

i dont think i will i shall go for

e miss grey went down the stairs slowly
cjytttng the rail now and again as if she
i wed its support mrs armytage fol-
her as far as the head of the stairs
she paused and going to the ojieri
bgdow overlooking the terrace called
and beckoned to reggie who was
rrjfcfag up and down impatiently awaiting
riaia return

  xow what is it   he muttered but
obeyed the signal entered the house by
 nearest door and reached the corridor

 	he second staircase mrs armytage
 ed him by the arm with the gesture of a
 ppirator aud drew him into the room
 opposite her own

     reggie she suid in a stage whisper
    lost my nigger

 lost your a hat   he exclaimed

     my black pearl

charles garvicc

bet you five to one iu bradburys that
youll find it at the bottom of your knitting
basket or in one of the silly bags you lug
about with you everywhere will you
take my bet  

   reggie bosensible i tell you-hush

whats that  someone is coming to put it
back  quick    she drew him further
into the room partly closed the door and
beckoned him to look through the narrow
opening they saw miriam grey coming
along tho corridor not with her usual light
firm step and erect heail but hurriedly
stealthily her head bent her face white
to the very lips reggie would have cried
out called to her but mrs armytage
clutched his arm and warned him to
silence they saw miriam stop before her
patrons door unlock it and enter the room

   oh in gods name what does it
mean   asked mrs armytage in a kind
of horror

   what does wbat mean   demanded
reggie fiercely and as he spoke he tlung
open the door and crossed the corridor
mrs armytage faltering fearfully behind
him miss grey heard their footsteps and
turned with a cry she confronted them
then she flung her hands before her face
from one of her hands fell a slight small
object reggie flew to her and mrs
armytage stooped and picked up the
object it was the black pearl she gazed
at it as it lay in her open palm hcr face
working thqn she burst into tears

 its the nigger she sobbed  oh my
dear how could you t you  ycm  
reggie had half led half carried miriam
grey to a sofa aud he turned an angry and
fiercely indignant face on mrs armytage

   what on earth are you saying   he
demanded then he went white and stood
for a moment silent  do you mean to
charge miriam-miss grey with stealing
the beastly thing  you must be out of
your mind

   i suppose  must be quavered mrs
armytage  but it dropped-she did-
drop it oh my dear  how could you i
and me so loud of you 

   stop that  said reggie steridy
 the tiling is impossible she could no
more steal your blessed jewellery than i
could kill a baby in cold wood tell her
so miriam and lets put an nd to this
nonsense he turned to her  and she
met his eyes with a sad  curious look m
hers the other two waited hung breath-
lessly on her silence rhe broke it at last
 i took it she said in  toneless leaden
voice

  you took- he gasped theu

he burst into a harsh laugh  oh come os
it you two   he said derisively  is this
bit of spoof got up for my benefit  is it a
sort of charade-  he stopped sud-
denly for there was no responsive smile on
the face of either woman and miriam stood
motionless as a statue her face set
impassive

   oh say you found it my dear  
wailed mrs armytage  say something
-any thing  

    i took it repeated miriam  there
is nothing more to be said she looked
for one instant at reggies haggard face
 i will never say anything else  you may
do with me whatever you please i-i
stole it

    thats all right  said reggie through
his clenched teeth  well let it go at
that youve got yonr pearl back auntie
so youre all serene i dont suppose you
want to make -a fuss but if you do make
it we dont care my wife and i are
going out to nairobi-

    your wife   gasped mrs armytage

   yes he said  miriam knows i
love her  here and now  beg her to marry
me-

    no no   miriam panted  never  

    yes  i think you will he said quietly
 oh no im not taking advantage of this
a flair but what i mean to say is that a
girl who is subject to hallucinations of this
sort any sort wants a strong man to look
after her up to date it is you who very
properly ought to have looked after me 
but thats changed- was going to say
 thank goodness   im going to marry
you dear if i have to carry you to church
in my arms as to nairobi i shall talo
you there dont you be afraid that i
shant make you liappy i love you too
much to fail see 

   miriam sank on to the sofa and covering
hor face with her hands sobbed softly
ho went to her and put his arm round her
and kopt it round her though she strove
to push it away

ng the amazing experiences of victor jones one of
the  men and women who last year took

foe roth memory course

the popular course at a popular price

 cu coursf i know you  mr addison
  of hull

  i remember corrcctly-and i do
 u rnber corrcctly-mr burroughs the
 j r merchant introduced me to you
 luncheon at the automobile club
 re	m this is

in may

  i havent seen

a
you

 jj- years ago
 gre indeed

 jj that day how is the grain busi-
 and how did that amalgamation
 r out  

k

 - e assurance of the speaker-in the
 bed corridor of the hotel metro-
 smpelled me to turn and look
 a though i must say it is not my
 jjhabit to eavesdrop even in a hotel

 david m roth the most
 memory expert in the world
  y friend kennedy answering my
 ion before i could get it out  he
 show you many more wonderful
 than that before the evening is

       he did

 vaie went into the banquet-rooin
 host was introducing a long line of
 sucsts to mr roth i got in line
  when it camc my turn mr roth
 i- what are your initials mr

 and your business and telephone
 r kr  why he asked this  learned
 hen he picked out from the
 o men he had met two hours
  ni nd called each by name without
 stake what is more he named
 business

 accurately

and telephone

   i wont tell you all the other amazing
 things this man did except how he
 called out without a minutes hesitation
 long lists of numbers bank clearings
 prices lot numbers parcel post rates
 and anything else the guests gave him
 in rapid order

   when i met mr roth again he rather
 bowled me over by saying in his quiet
 modest way 

    there is nothing miraculous about
 my remembering anything  want to
 remember whether it be names faces
 figures tacts or something i have read
 in a magazine

     you can do this just at easily as i do

    my own memory continued mr
 roth  was originally very faulty yes
 it was-a really poor memory on meet-
 ing a man  would forget his name in
 thirty seconds while now there are
 probably  men and women many
 of whom i have met but once whose
 names i can recall instantly on meeting
 them

    that is all right for you mr roth
  interrupted  you have given years
 to it but how about me

     mr jones he replied  i can teach
 you the secret of a good memory in ont
 rvtning i have done it with thousands
 of pupils in the first of seven simple
 lessons which i have prepared for home
 study i show you the basic principle of
 my whole system and you will find it
 not hard work as you might fear but
 just like playing a fascinating game i
 will prove it to you

 tl

  he didnt have to prove it his
course did  i got it the very next day
from his publishers

  when i tackled the first lesson  was
amazed to find that  had learned-in
about one hour-how to remember a
list of one hundred words so that i could
call them out forward and back without
a single mistake

  that first lesson stuck and so did
the other six

  read this letter from c louis allen
who at  years became head of a
 concern the pyrene manufac-
turing company makers of the famous
fire extinguisher -

    now that the rath memory
  course is finished i want to tell you
  how much i have enjoyed the study
  of this most fascinating subject
  usually these courses involve a great
  deal of drudgery but this has been
  nothing but pure pleasure all the way
  through i have derived much bene-
  fit from taking the course of instruc-
  tions and feel that  shall continue
  to strengthen my memory that is
  the best part of it  shall be glad
  of an opportunity to recommend your
  work to my friends

  mr allen didnt put it a bit too
strongly

  the roth course is priceless  i can
absolutely count on my memory now
i can call the name of almost any man
i have met before-and  am getting
better all the time  can remember
any figures i wish to remember tele-
phone numbers come to mind instantly
once i have filed them by mr roths
easy method addresses are just as
easy

  the old fear of forgetting you know
what that is has vanished

  perhaps the most enjoyable part of
it all is that  have bccome a good
conversationalist

  i can recall like a flash of light
almost any fact i want just at the
stant  need it most  used to th
a brilliant memory belonged only tojj
prodigy and genius now i see
every man of us has that kind
memory if he only knows how to tsa
it work properly

  i tell you it is a wonderful thwjj
after groping around in the dark rjr
so many years to be able to switch 
big searchlight on your mind and
instantly everything you want to
member

  my advice to you is don
another minute send to the nati
business and personal efficiency
partment  of the standard art
co ltd  chancery lane vva
for mr roths amazing course and
what a wonderful memory you i
got your dividends in increased  j
ingpower will be enormous

victor jos

send no money

  so confident arc the publishers
roth memory course that once
have an opportunity to see in yf
own home how easy it is to douw
yes treble your memory power
few short hours they arc willing to

  dont send any money merely  jjj
a letter and the complete course 
be sent at once  f you are not cthii
satisfied send it back any time
three days after you receive it and 
will owe nothing

l

  but if you arc as pleased as arcwjjo
 other men and worn
have taken the course send only
in full payment you take n  
and you have everything to gainfjt-
post the letter now before this re
able offer is withdrawn
