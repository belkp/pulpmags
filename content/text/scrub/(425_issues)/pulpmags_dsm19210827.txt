 reward jfer two hours work warren bigelow the finger print detective was making liis usual review of the morning newspapers he had just finished reading tiie press reports of the daring jobbery of the offices of the t- o- company when the telephone on his

desk rang central office was calling asking him to come im-
mediately to the scene of the robbery

  although he drove his high powered roadster rapidly and ar-
rived very shortly at his destination ho had plenty of time to con-
sider the main features of the case as reported by the press the
job had undoubtedly been done by skilled cracksmen and rob-
bers of uncommon nerve sixty-five hundred dollars in currency
-the company pay-roll-were gone not a single apparent clew
had been found by the police

  on ilia arrival bigelow waa
greeted by nick austin chief of
detectives who had gone over the
ground thoroughly

  hello warren heres a job
that has us stumped i hope you
can unravel it for us

  by this time the district officers
and the operatives from central
office had almost given up the in-
vestigation after hours of fruit-
less efforts their work was at a
standstill they were completely baffled

  with lively interest and a feeling of relief they stepped back
to await the results of the finger print detectives findings
they were plainly awed at his quiet shrewd way the adroit
old chief himself was manifestly impressed at the quick sure
way in which bigelow made his investigation

almost immediately bigelow turned his attention to a heavy

  the woman in the limousine

tanding in the dark door-
way of a delicatessen shop
kingdon cole gazed through
the fog and drizzle of the oc-
tober night at a second-story window
across the street the brim of a slouch
hat shaded his eyes and most of his
face his lean figure was draped in a
mackintosh that reached almost to his
feet the upward slant of the cigar
clamped between his teeth hinted at
total absorption in what he saw

   the building that claimed his atten-
tion was an ordinary three-story struc-
ture of murky brick flanked by a
warehouse on one side and a second-
hand clothing store on the other it
presented a sullen and gloomy aspect
to the watcher across the street yet

there was something in the very drab-
ness of the house and the chill atmos-
phere which hung over it that might
have appealed to the imagination of a
man like kingdon cole

  a mans head and shoulders were
dimly silhouetted against the lighted
window shade at which he was looking
so fixedly for half an hour or longer
the figure had not stirred the rigid
poise of the head and the stiff set of the
shoulders suggested that the man at the
window was engaged in a task that oc-
cupied his whole mind

  cole struck a match andholding it
in his cupped hands lighted his dead
cigar the flickering light shone for an
instant on fingers that were long slim
and finely tapering the fingers of a man
of great mental energy and a compell-
ing personality

  wonder what the learned professor


detective story magazine

carmody finds so interesting he mum-
bled some scientific treatise very
likely or perhaps it is-

  he lowered his gaze as he vaguely
sensed that a pair of eyes was trying
to pierce the gloom in which he stood
what with the wet night and the late-
ness of the hour that dreary section of
bleecker street was all but deserted
now and then a cross-town car jogged
along at a lumbering pace occasionally
a taxicab passed on its way

  coie looked up and down the block
the impression was more distinct now
some one was watching him just as he
was watching the solitary figure in the
window his senses sharpened by
long training told him he was under
observation even before he could trace
the impression to its source now he
saw a limousine drawn up at the cor-
ner less than twenty paces from where
he stood its sides of burnt sienna
gleamed in the blurred lights it
seemed to lend a touch of affluence to
the squalor and dreariness of the scene
how long the car had been there he
did not know for the window across
the street had claimed all his attention

  the car began to move crawling
snaillike and silent toward the point
where cole stood it stopped opposite
the doorway that sheltered him he
fancied that he saw the flicker of a face
behind the curtains then the door
opened a few inches and cole caught a
glimpse of a beckoning hand

  coles eyes narrowed under their
puckering brows the monotony of
his vigil was being broken in a strange
way and the slow twisting of his lips
signified that the interruption was not
altogether displeasing once more he
glanced up at the window across the
street noticing that the shadowy fig-
ure had not stirred then he crossed
the sidewalk and instantly the door of
the limousine was flung wide

  wont you step in mr cole asked
a voice

  though his life had inured him to
surprises cole started a little it was
odd that the occupant of the car should
address him by name the interior was
dark but in the shadows he saw the
figure of a woman

  you are very patient mr cole the
voice continued you are wasting
your time however it isnt likely that
professor carmody will go out to-
night so you might as well jump in

  a sharp hunching of coles shoulders
registered surprise number two it
was all very mystifying not only did
the occupant of the car know his name
but she seemed familiar with his busi-
ness as well he liked her voice a deep
soprano with a faintly playful under-
tone for a moment he studied the
long slender lines of her figure faintly
discernible in the dusk and melting
here and there into a background of
saffron-hued cushions

  you hesitate i happen to know
that professor carmody is in for the
night and that your vigilance is use-
less

  cole looked at her intently the
mist the drizzle and the blurred sheen
from the street lamps seemed to lend a
touch of unreality to what he saw and
heard

  what do you know about professor
carmody he demanded

  a great deal more than you do its
quite possible that i am in a position
to give you some valuable information
at any rate my car is more comfortable
than a dark doorway

  she leaned forward slightly and
there was a trace of mockery on her
faintly parted lips not afraid are
you mr cole

  he gave a low laugh at the implied
dare with a shrug he stepped inside
the car and sat down beside her she
picked up the speaking tube and turn-
ing her head away from cole said
something which he could not hear in
an instant the car was in motion
the unknown seven



  you seem to know a great dfal
he observed trying to obtain a glimpse
of her face under the billowing brim
that shaded it

  and you are anxious to learn how
much more i know isnt it so mr
cole it was neither vulgar curiosity
nor adventurousness that prompted you
to accept my invitation to ride with me
you accepted only because you hoped
to learn something having heard me
speak your name and mention pro-
fessor carmody you naturally thought
it might be profitable to cultivate my
acquaintance

  perhaps so said cole dryly
what do you know about me aside
from my name and my interest in the
estimable professor

  a great deal was the surprisingly
prompt reply you are a student of
criminology a follower in the footsteps
of lombroso pinel and prichard
though you by no means accept their
theories you have written two books
on crime and criminals they are too
scientific for the general reader i have
been told but experts on the subject
regard them as authoritative perhaps
some day i shall try to read them

  i fear you wont find them very in-
teresting replied cole what else
you live in a small apartment in
gramercy park which also serves as
your office two years ago you did a
very brilliant piece of work on the wil-
merding murder case though you mag-
nanimously or for reasons of your
own let the police claim the credit for
the results you follow criminal inves-
tigations largely as a scientific pursuit
if you cared to devote all your time to
it you could make a great success but
you accept only such cases as happen
to interest you personally as a result
you lead a quiet and somewhat precari-
ous existence deriving your sole pleas-
ure from your work and such inexpen-
sive amusements as books music and
on rare occasions the theater

  she paused though her face still
eluded him cole felt she was smiling
at his bewilderment the car had
turned south and was running at a
leisurely pace he glanced at the win-
dow but the glass wras studded with
drops of moisture and permitted him to
see nothing but drab stretches of office
buildings

  you seem to have taken consider-
able pains looking me up he re-
marked

  oh i havent told you ail i know
yet i have learned a number of things
about your private life and personal
habits but we neednt go into those
things now

  are you equally well informed in
regard to professor carmody

  not quite the professor is a rid-
dle to all outward appearances he is
interested in nothing but his experi-
ments and his musty old books he
seems to be living in that kind of neigh-
borhood by preference because he isnt
so apt to be bothered by meddling
neighbors his house is said to contain
one of the best-equipped laboratories of
its kind in the world thats only a
rumor of course the professor
doesnt encourage visitors to the few
people who have talked with him he is
what the novelists call a man of mys-
tery he comes and goes without
speaking to any one and his life is a
closed book as far as i know only
one person has been inside his house in
a year and that person never came
out

  oh you know that

  yes i am one of the very few who
are aware of the fact let me see its
about three weeks since malcolm
reeves disappeared his relatives
your clients in other words have rea-
son to believe that he visited professor
carmody on the night of his disappear-
ance no wonder the case fascinates
you mr cole disappearances are al-
ways interesting but especially so when


detective story magazine

a mysterious person like professor car-
mody is involved

  cole regarded her in frank amaze-
ment but her head was now slightly
bowed and all he could see of her face
was the curve of the chin

  the relatives did well to put the
case in your hands she went on you
are both capable and discreet and as i
presume you know there were excellent
reasons for not reporting reeves disap-
pearance to the police are you mak-
ing satisfactory progress

  my clients seem satisfied

  you have not yet paid the professor
a visit

  what would be the use

  you are right of course it would
only put him on his guard you prefer
not to let him know that he is under
suspicion she laughed gently as if
amused at something besides it is
doubtful whether a search of car-
modys house would reveal any clews
to reeves fate the professor is a
chemist and i understand there are
certain chemical processes by which
bodies can be made to disappear com-
pletely leaving no trace

  then you think reeves has been
murdered 

  dont you  she asked quickly

  cole smiled instead of answering
the question he asked another how
can you be so sure that carmody will
not leave his house to-night
because he has the best of reasons
for staying in

  what are they

  one is that his engagement for to-
night was canceled by telephone at
four oclock this afternoon

  cole gave her a puzzled stare how
do you know that 

  she laughed a little there are
ways of finding out she said mys-
teriously tapped wires for instance
but the professors principal reason for
staying in to-night is that he is well
aware that you are watching him you

see mr cole he has more shrewdness
than you have been giving him credit
for and the fact that he is staying in
on your account shows that he has great
respect for your ability

  she had raised her head a trifle and
cole gave her a long bewildered
glance he half expected to see a
smile on her lips but her face was
grave

  are you one of reeves relatives
he asked abruptly

  oh no

 then how-

  i have certain sources of informa-
tion sources so vast that you would
be staggered if i were to tell you of
them please dont look at me like
that i am not insane neither am i
subject to hallucinations the fact that
i happen to know more about the car-
mody case than you do is no reflection
on your ability as an investigator it
merely shows that your equipment is
inadequate care to hear more

  what else do you know

  i know that the case you are work-
ing on is only one minor angle of a
vast mystery the disappearance of
malcolm reeves is nothing but an in-
cident reeves himself was only an in-
significant puppet in one of the greatest
games ever played all you have seen
so far is one of the minor threads in
the woof i am always mixing my
metaphors but i know you wont mind
mr cole this affair has ramifications
that may some day rock the whole con-
tinent

  i feel considerably shaken up al-
ready admitted cole you realize
of course that you are using strong
words 

  no stronger than the situation de-
mands

  if it is as bad as all that why doesnt
somebody put a stop to it 

  because- she checked herself

and regarded him intently well be-
the unknown seven



cause the man who is big enough for
the task has not yet been found

  again cole cast a glance at the win-
dow the car had made several turns
in the last few minutes he caught
only a blurred view of his surround-
ings but he thought they were travers-
ing one of the cavernlike streets near
the southern tip of manhattan island

 have you heard enough she
asked

  just enough to give me an appetite
for more

  in that case you must trust me im-
plicitly and obey me without questions
i am taking desperate chances in con-
fiding in you mr cole and certain pre-
cautions are absolutely necessary will
you promise me on your honor that you
will not try to ascertain the location of
the place i shall take you to 

  cole considered there was a flavor
of mystery about the adventure that ap-
pealed to him but the prospect of learn-
ing something more about the carmody
case was an even greater temptation
from what little the woman had so far
told him he surmised that she must
have unusual sources of information
much that she had said coincided with
what he already knew so he had no
cause to doubt her truthfulness

  you have my promise he told her

  the car made another turn swung
down a dark block then veered again
to the south cole caught a hazy
glimpse of dark towering skyscrapers

  the woman looked at him fixedly as
if in doubt i believe you are a man
of your word mr cole but promises
are sometimes broken in spite of the
best intentions please dont be of-
fended

  she produced a scarf and with a deft
touch covered his eyes securing the
bandage with a firm knot at the back
cole chuckled amusedly he might be
walking into a trap but it would not be
the first time and he had great confi-
dence in his ability to take care of him-

self in any situation that might come
up-

  after continuing its zigzagging
course a few minutes longer the car
stopped his mysterious conductress
touched coles arm as they stepped out
she guided him across the sidewalk and
up a few stone steps and then they
traversed what appeared to be a long
corridor finally cole found himself
in a narrow inclosure which he guessed
to be an elevator

  we are in one of the tallest office
buildings in new york the woman
whispered in his ear but youre not
likely to guess its name

  the door clanked shut and the cage
shot swiftly upward cole felt a rush
of wind in his ears he maintained a
languid composure but inwardly he
marveled a modern skyscraper was
the last place he would have expected
the woman to take him to he tried to
estimate the number of floors they were
passing five ten fifteen twenty-

  still the cage darted upward and
then it stopped so suddenly that he
caught his breath sharply they
stepped out and the girl removed the
scarf from his eyes he gazed around
him bewilderedly all about him with
the exception of a single elevator shaft
was a vast expanse of blank wall
there was no sign of doors or win-
dows and the only illumination was a
small electric bulb in the ceiling

  we came up in a private elevator
the woman explained this is the top
floor to the public at large and to
most of the tenants of the building it
practically does not exist this way
mr cole

  she stepped to one of the corners of
the triangular space of which the ele-
vator shaft formed the center and cole
followed in the dim light he could not
see exactly what happened but the
womans hand went out and then a
narrow portion of the wall slid back
they stepped through an aperture and


detective story magazine

instantly the opening closed behind
them they were in a long corridor
with doors on each side

  surprised she asked starting to
lead him down the hall

  rather never expected to find
such mysterious contrivances in a mod-
ern office building

  her only reply was a low laugh the
floor of the corridor was luxuriously
carpeted the doors on either side had
a solid appearance coles amazement
grew he wondered what was beyond
the massive doors and what was the
nature of this establishment that was
hidden behind blank walls he had
little time for speculation for his com-
panion opened a door and bade him
enter

  excuse me mr cole she mur-
mur mu red when she had switched on
the light i shall be back directly
the door closed and she was gone
alone cole looked about him and his
eyes opened wide in astonishment

chapter ii

temptation

por a moment cole forgot that he
was in a building devoted to the
rather prosaic pursuits of commerce
the room in which he stood bordered
by walls of paneled walnut was worthy
of a fifth avenue mansion it struck
him as a bit grotesque from an ele-
vator he had stepped through a blank
wall into a magnificence that fairly
dazzled him it was like an arabian
nights adventure as he looked about
him he saw quiet elegance everywhere
without a taint of showiness for some
time he stood lost in admiration then
he noticed that the room had no win-
dows a moment later he discovered
that the door was locked on the outside
despite the splendor that surrounded
him he was virtually a prisoner

  he sat down and smoked a cigarette
waiting for his strange conductress to

return evidently the walls were
solidly built for no sounds reached
him the air was fresh and pure de-
spite the absence of windows hinting
that there was a concealed ventilator
somewhere in the room

  the armchair was comfortable and
he stretched out his lean figure slightly
short of six feet the man suggested
mental force rather than bodily
strength but a great surprise awaited
any antagonist who underestimated
coles physical prowess he was far
stronger than the average man and his
endurance was phenomenal his gray
eyes with a faint humorous twinkle in
their depths were fixed on the door
his dark face slightly lined about the
mouth and the outer corners of the
eyes bore a look of mild expectancy
in moments of repose cole looked as
though he had not a care in the world
his friends often wondered how he
managed to maintain the freshness and
sparkle suggestive of a recent needle
shower perhaps it was because he
was thoroughly in love with his work
and had learned to shake off the minor
frets and irritations of life

  in the midst of his musings the door
opened and he stared rather rudely at
the vision that entered it was the
woman and she had undergone an
amazing transformation since he last
saw her he wondered whether the
shimmering gown she wore had been
designed by poiret himself its deli-
cate rose color afforded a charming
contrast to her complexion a sort of
luminous white that somehow es-caped
being pale standing there with a faint
smile on her lips her face fringed by
an aureole of fine-spun gold she was
easily the most bewitching woman cole
had ever seen

  he rose bowed and gazed apprecia-
tively at the simple but strikingly effec-
tive ornament she wore at her throat

  sorry to have kept you waiting
she murmured sit down please and
the unknown seven



smoke as much as you like i want to
talk with you

  cole sat down he wondered if she
had arrayed herself like this for the
sole purpose of having a talk with him

  you promised to tell me something
more about the carmody case he re-
minded her i suppose you brought
me to this charming place so that we
might have a quiet talk without danger
of interruption or eavesdropping

  she sat down a short distance from
him by degrees the smile faded from
her lips a curiously solemn expres-
sion crept into her face havent i
told you enough mr cole

  what little you told me was only
a provocation it gave me a taste for
more by the way you have the ad-
vantage over me wont you tell me
your name

  you may call me miss brown
the name doesnt fit you he ob-
jected

  names never do fit thats one of
the ironies of existence for the pres-
ent until we know each other better
it will have to be miss brown i had
to tell you a little about the carmody
case in order to get your attention i
hope i convinced you that it is quite
useless for you to continue at work on
a case that is so enormous in scope and
presents such insuperable difficulties
mr cole a pleading note had come
into her voice can anything persuade
you to drop the carmody case 

  she bent forward a little with
hands clasped across her knee she
studied him intently and cole looked
into the deepest bluest eyes he had ever
seen

  efrop the carmody case he ex-
claimed

  you must drop it mr cole if you
knew more about it what terrible
things you are going up against you
would willingly drop it without further
argument you would recognize your

utter helplessness in the matter not to
mention a number of other things

  cole was momentarily speechless
he found himself strangely impressed
by her big sorcerous eyes full of mute
pleading and entreaty

  i dont understand you dont real-
ize what you are saying why should
i drop the case 

  because of the things i have told
you

  cole laughed they are only an
added incentive for me to go on with
it

  she drew a long breath thats
your mans way of looking at things
the greater the dangers and difficul-
ties the more determined you are to
forge ahead you dont stop to con-
sider the price or estimate the cost
the wreckage you scatter about you
means nothing to you all you think of
is the gratification of your boundless
ambition mr cole wont you forgo
your foolish pride and do what i ask
her eyes held him despite his will
there was a look of terror in their
depths that exerted a subtle appeal
upon him he got to his feet and tried
to shake off the fascination of her
beauty and her magnetic personality

  impossible he declared if you
brought me here in the hope of induc-
ing me to drop the carmody case your
time and effort are wasted

  please mr cole forget that you
ever heard of this terrible case tell
your clients in the morning that you
will have nothing further to do with
it

  that wouldnt alter matters they
would promptly accept my resignation
and engage somebody else

  there is only one kingdon cole
thats a very neat compliment but
it wont bear analysis i havent ac-
complished anything very wonderful
and another man could finish what i
have begun

  she was silent for a time her big


detective siory magazine

luminous eyes regarding him implor-
ingly if you wont drop the case for
your own sake because of the terrible
dangers involved then i beg you to do
so for my sake

  for your sake really miss-er-
brown i dont understand what is
your interest in the carmody case 
she stepped up and clutched his
hand the touch of her fingers sent a
thrill through him her eyes were
moist and the curve beneath her throat
rose and fell with accelerated rhythm
yes for my sake i cant explain ex-
cept to say that awful things will hap-
pen to me if you go on death would
be as nothing in comparison doesnt
a womans soul mean anything to you
mr cole

  cole looked down into her eyes
while her fingers spasmodically
clutched his hand far into their blue
depths he gazed and suddenly his face
underwent a change his lips curled
a trifle and a hard glint came into his
eyes somewhat roughly he released
his hand

very touching he dryly remarked
but i dont see the connection between
the carmody case and a womans soul
she drew back with a little sob of
bafflement

  if you meant your own soul miss
brown you mentioned something that
doesnt exist he went on sarcastically
trickery and pretense are poor substi-
tutes for soul

  what do you mean 

  he shrugged disgustedly your act-
ing is superb but it wont bear close
inspection you were splendid at a
little distance despite the fact that i
am the only kingdon cole as you so
charmingly phrased it i am rather sus-
ceptible to the tears of a beautiful
woman with your sobs and your love-
liness you could have melted a stone
if such a feat were possible as soon
as i got a close view of you however
i knew you were only shamming your

eyes gave you away when you sprung
that choice line about a womans soul
perhaps you realized you were laying
the pathos on too thick anyway the
illusion is shattered and all that re-
mains is the gorgeous gown you are
wearing it is really stunning

  thank you she said coldly drop-
ping the role she had been playing as
easily as she would a wrap no doubt
i should have known better than to try
such methods on you

  yes you should said cole for
despite the little slip you made i be-
lieve that you are really a very clever
woman now that we are off the sub-
ject of womens souls wont you tell
me your real reason for wishing me to
throw up the carmody case

  she shook her head but he thought
he detected a gleam of unwilling admi-
ration in her eyes motioning him to
follow she stepped to the door and
opened it then preceded him down the
hall cole guessed that his little ad-
venture was over and he felt a twinge
of disappointment at the thought that
in all probability he would never learn
the meaning of her puzzling behavior
no doubt she would try to blindfold
him again before conducting him away
from the place and he was prepared to
raise strenuous objections

  but it appeared miss brown was not
yet ready to let him go she stopped
before one of the massive doors that
had already excited his curiosity and
knocked twice it opened quickly and
noiselessly in a moment before he
realized what he was doing cole was
inside and the door closed at his back

  the room was so dimly lighted that
at first he could distinguish nothing but
bare gloomy walls miss brown who
had followed him into the room has-
tened forward and seemed to melt away
in the dusk leaving him to wonder
what new turn his adventure was tak-
ing gradually as his eyes grew ac-
customed to the gloom he was able to
the unknown seven



see objects with some degree of clear-
ness he was in a long narrow room
and what he saw was in keeping with
the other strange things that he had
witnessed and expcricnccd in this sur-
prising establishment

  a number of shadowy figures were
seated around a circular table in the
center of the room he counted seven
of them and at first he had a ludicrous
impression that there were only blank
spaces where their faces should have
been them as his pupils continued to
respond to the strain imposed by the
dim light he saw that each man wore a
mask it was only a strip of cloth with
tiny slits over the eyes but in the dusk
it was the only covering that was
needed to make recognition impossible

  again cole was struck with a sense
of unreality the men sitting stiffly
erect in their chairs caused him to
wonder whether he was in the midst of
some ghostly seance he felt their eyes
searching him through the vents in the
masks the gloom and the silence gave
an added illusory touch to the scene
cole had to shake himself before he
could realize that he was on the top
floor of a modern skyscraper

  miss brown stepped behind one of
the chairs and held a brief wrhispered
conversation with its occupant the
latter nodded and the girl slipped away
toward the door a moment later it
closed behind her and the man with
whom she had been talking indicated
that cole was to step forward with a
shrug he complied and the masked
faces stirred slightly as he approachcd
for a full minute nothing was said
and again he felt the sharp and steady
scrutiny of seven pairs of eyes finally
the man who had beckoned him spoke
mr cole how much will you take to
drop the carmody case

  cole could not help but laugh the
words spoken with a directness and a
mattcr-of-factness that left nothing to
the imagination had shattered the illu-

sion completely in an instant the spell
of unreality was broken he knew he
was dealing with practical men who
were in the habit of reducing every-
thing to terms of dollars and cents a
blunt reply came to his lips but his de-
sire to learn more of these strange men
caused him to hold it back

  suppose we put all the cards on the
table he suggested i dont like to
talk business in the dark who are you
and what is your objection to my con-
nection with the carmody case

  we are not here to answer ques-
tions declared the one who seemed to
be acting as spokesman for the others
all i care to say is that because of
a peculiar combination of circum-
stances it is to our advantage to pay
you liberally for withdrawing from the
case whats your price mr cole

  under ordinary circumstances cole
would have been indignant at this cool
assumption that every man has his
price but now his dominant emotion
was curiosity he- could not understand
why they seemed so intent upon per-
suading him to sever his connection
with the affair but what miss brown
had said about the vast ramifications of
the carmody case suggested that they
had ample reasons for what they were
doing

  let me get this straight he said
evenly you are willing to pay me my
price for withdrawing from the car-
mody case are there any strings to
the proposition 

 the other chuckled dryly j
wouldnt call them strings exactly
they are only gossamer threads in
addition to retiring from the case you
are to give us a full and veracious re-
port of what you have discovered to
date in connection with the disappear-
ance of malcolm reeves

  i see said cole anything else

  just one thing more in addition to
withdrawing from your present connec-
tion with the case and turning the in-


detective story magazine

formation you possess over to us you
are to come over to our side and put
your ability at our disposal we are
ready to pay you handsomely for your
services either on a contingent basis
or in the form of a weekly salary
very generous declared cole with
a faint trace of sarcasm your propo-
sion is that for a consideration i am to

betray my present clients and-

  betray is a harsh word objected
the spokesman for the group

  truthful terms are usually harsh
cole remarked lets not quibble over
words in addition to the amount
which you are willing to pay me for
betraying my clients you offer to re-
ward me liberally for certain services
that you require may i ask what they
are

  you will learn soon enough if you
accept our proposition let me state
that we have unlimited funds at our
disposal and stand ready to pay you
well it would be no exaggeration to
say that in a short time you should be
a rich man if you accept our offer in
view of our liberality dont you think it
behooves you to be less squeamish and
ask fewer questions

  i suppose it is in deucedly bad taste
for me to argue with a man who offers
me a fortune on a silver platter cole
admitted just the same i cant help
wondering why you are offering such a
glittering bribe to one who is practi-
cally unknown in his profession

  the man gave an amused chuckle
dont worry about that mr cole we
are not in the habit of buying pigs in a
poke you have been under observa-
tion for some time

  so i gathered from what the be-
witching miss-brown told me

  we have learned that you have a
great deal of ability you are fearless
and persevering you have qualities
that the average professional detective
sadly lacks such as tact polish and a
magnetic personality in short you are

precisely the kind of man we need we
have reason to believe that you have
discovered certain interesting facts in
connection with malcolm reeves dis-
appearance facts which would natu-
rally become our property if you came
over to our side

  cole marveled at the extent of the
mans knowledge it was true that he
had picked up several stray facts
which when considered in conjunction
with the known circumstances of
reeves disappearance made a fairly
interesting showing his glance wan-
dered over the circle of veiled faces
each of the seven men was watching
him intently through the slits in the
masks

  we are waiting for your decision
mr cole remarked the spokesman
after a pause if our proposition ap-
peals to you name your price

  cole pretended to hesitate he hoped
to learn a little more before he closed
the interview he wondered how far
these men would go in their efforts to
induce him to betray his clients and
transfer his allegiance to themselves
arent you forgetting something he
asked do you realize that a man who
has been bought once will probably sell
himself again

  though he could not see he fancied
the spokesmans eyes were twinkling
behind the mask

  we have considered everything mr
cole you wouldnt sell yourself ex-
cept to a higher bidder and it isnt
likely any one will outbid us if such
a situation should arise however we
would know how to handle it what is
your price

  suppose you name the price you are
willing to pay

  there was a craning of necks and
nods and subdued whispers passed
around the circle evidently the seven
construed his words as meaning that he
was yielding the spokesman unlocked
the unknown seven

a drawer in front of him and placed a
small package on the table

  twenty-five thousand dollars he
remarked impressively if you are in
doubt as to the amount or if you sus-
pect that i am handing you stage
money you will be permitted to exam-
ine it in the light

  he handed the package to cole re-
member that this is only your retaining
fee so to speak there will be lots
more coming to you if you decide to
throw in your lot with us

  cole felt the crisp fiber of the bills
he did not doubt that the money was
genuine or that the package contained
the exact amount mentioned by the
spokesman whatever else these men
might do he did not think they would
stoop to petty cheating an odd sensa-
tion surged through him as he weighed
the currency in the palm of his hand
it was more money than had ever be-
fore come within his reach of a sud-
den he remembered some of the things
he had been compelled to deny himself
because of his slender and uncertain
income until this moment when he
held the wherewithal in his hand it
had not occurred to him that he was
missing any of the good things in life
he had accepted his privations as a
matter of course with a smile or a
shrug according to his mood of the
moment

  for a few seconds longer he gave
himself over to thrill of possession and
then he tossed the bundle of currency
down on the table it isnt enough
he declared

  a chorus of murmurs went around
the circular table the veiled faces
strained forward a little once again
cole fancied the spokesmans eyes were
twinkling through the orifices in the
mask

  splendid mr cole said the man
approvingly i didnt think twenty-
five thousand would satisfy you but i
wanted to make sure as a matter of

fact if you had accepted such a paltry
amount we would have broken off the
negotiations instantly we dont want
a man who holds himself cheap here
-again he opened the drawer in front
of him-is another twenty-five thou-
sand that makes fifty quite a neat
sum for a man whose income last year
was only a trifle over four thousand

  how did you know that 

  income tax reports said the man

  cole took one bundle of currency in
each hand he was no longer marvel-
ing at the surprising sources of infor-
mation that seemed to be open to these
men for the moment all his senses
were centered on the wealth that lay
in his palms a flash of self-revelation
came to him and he was surprised and
frightened by it he had never known
that mere money could give him such
a delectable sensation in the past as
a passive onlooker he had smiled tol-
erantly at other mens scramble for
wealth with philosophic eyes he had
watched the money-mad procession
sweep by him now he found that the
sheer touch of the currcncy sent a con-
tagion through his veins awakening
strange emotions within him

  the sensation put an indefinable fear
into him fear of himself and the weak-
ness he had just discovered of a sud-
den the currency seemed to scorch his
palms he shrugged and the spell was
broken with an inward paroxysm he
flung the money down on the table
not even that is enough he an-
nounced in slightly dazed tones like
one just awakening from a dream

  the spokesmans head came up a
little with a shrug and an indistinct
mutter he once more opened the
drawer but cole laid a detaining hand
on his sleeve

  wait he said quietly you are
going ahead on the idea that every man
has his price youre mistaken there
isnt money enough in the whole united
states treasury to buy me


detective story magazine

  there came a hush and then a ripple
of commotion went around the table it
died instantly as the spokesman raised
a silencing hand he tilted his head
back and through the holes in the mask
his eyes bored into coles face for a
time not a sound was heard in the room
finally the spokesman gave a short
contemptuous laugh i see he de-
clared youre a weakling like most
men youre a slave to the absurd
thing we call conscience i had hoped
that you were one of the rare excep-
tions

  wrong again said cole smiling
it isnt conscience anyway i
wouldnt call it that it is only pride
a foolish pride perhaps i want to go
through life knowing that i can look
every man straight in the eye and tell
him to go to the devil if necessary i
couldnt do that if i were to sell my-
self i should become a despicable
thing in my own eyes and life wouldnt
be worth living after that i dont sup-
pose you understand but thats just
how i feel

  seven pairs of eyes were leveled at
coles face as his short crisp sentences
fell on the tense air then came
silence a long and oddly vibrant silence
during which cole experienced an un-
accountable feeling that his life hung
in the balance he could neither under-
stand it nor trace it to its source but
the nameless sense of danger grew
more distinct with every moment

  by instinct his hand went to the hip
pocket in which he always carried a
small but reliable pistol before his
hand could touch the weapon a strange
thing happened the spokesmans arm
described a slight movement in the
dusk and in a twinkling utter darkness
fell cole stood in blackness so intense
that it seemed as though he could
touch it

  his fingers found the handle of the
pistol but in the next instant his hand
fell to his side in that impenetrable

darkness the weapon was of no more
avail than a toy he heard a faint
scraping of chairs then a patter of
feet he groped for the chair where
the spokesman had sat but it was
empty gradually the faint sounds
ceased and then came an engulfing
silence it was as if every manifesta-
tion of life had been drained out of the
blackness that surrounded him

  silence - darkness - solitude cole
as he dropped into the spokesmans
chair felt as if the three words had
suddenly acquired a new and more
powerful significance

chapter iii

the temptress speaks

pive minutes passed cole could no
longer control his restlessness he
got up from the chair and went grop-
ingly across the heavily carpeted floor
his footsteps made scarcely a sound
and he had a queer sensation that the
darkness and silence were insinuating
themselves into his very pores it was
as if a magic spell had fallen over him
he could no longer trust his reason or
his senses

  he stopped short as a faint whisper
went through the dead silence with
head thrown back and straining his ears
he listened again the whisper came
trailing through the blackness like a
disembodied breath some one was
calling his name he groped in the di-
rection whence the sound came and
now he could hear it quite distinctly

  mr cole

  tracing the sound vibrations he
crossed the floor and brought up
against a wall again his name was
spoken and now he had an impression
that the speaker was only a few feet
away he thought he recognized the
voice

  mr cole

  his highly sensitized ears gauged and
dissected each small fraction of a syl-
the unknown seven



lable he knew lie was not mistaken
the voice belonged to the woman who
had introduced herself by the absurdly
inappropriate name of miss brown

 where are you he asked he
fumbled with his hands in the dark but
found nothing but emptiness he
turned and ran his fingers up and down
the wall until he encountered a metallic
object imbedded in the paneling again
his name was called and he gave a
short laugh as he realized that the
sounds were coming to him through the
mouthpiece of a speaking tube the
touch of the cold metal against his fin-
gers seemed to shatter an illusion
simple though the contrivance was it
smacked of up-to-dateness a sense of
reality broke the spell which the weird
events of the night had cast over him

  hello -he spoke into the mouth-
piece you miss brown

  a brief pause and then her voice
came to him in hurried tones that be-
spoke intense excitement yes mr
cole i must warn you i feel respon-
sible for your predicament awful
things will happen if you persist in
your headstrong course you must
abandon it and accept the proposition
that was made to you otherwise-

  her voice quavered and broke the
suspended sentence and the words she
had left unspoken impressed cole
grimly he could almost see her white
and shuddering at the other end of the
speaking tube though he knew she
was a clever actress there was an ear-
nestness in her tones that gave him
pause

  you mean these men will kill me
unless i accept their vile terms he
asked

  oh they will do worse than that
they are terrible men mr cole and
they are in a desperate temper death
a hundred deaths would be preferable
to the thing they intend doing wont
you come to your senses before its too
late  oh please-

  cole laughed into the mouthpiece
compose yourself miss brown dont
worry on my account ive been in
tight corners before and i always wrig-
gled out of them somehow i shall do
so this time

  a sob sounded at the other end and
then all was quiet cole drew away
from the speaking tube it might have
been only another bit of clever acting
but miss browns warning had left him
in a state of tingling suspense she
had hinted at dire things that were to
happen to him and cole tried to tell
himself that she had only been exercis-
ing her imagination such things be-
longed in the realm of romance and
melodrama it was laughable to think
that they might happen on the top floor
of a skyscraper located close to the
worlds financial nerve center the in-
congruity of it struck cole as quite
amusing

  he chuckled but in the next instant
he sharply caught his breath a sound
resembling that of a clicking lock-
reached his ears he heard nothing
more but he had a feeling that some
one had entered the room that he was
no longer alone instinctively he
braced himself to resist an attack his
ears were keyed to catch the slightest
sound every muscle in his body had
the tension of a cocked trigger

  he stood with his back against the
wall all his senses quiveringly alert
he could neither hear nor see but he
knew some one was steadily approach-
ing from the fariher end of the long
room presently he could hear sounds
of breathing but the prowlers progress
was still muffled by the heavy carpet
now a little thud signified that the in-
truder had walked up against the cir-
cular table so he could be no more than
a few feet from where cole stood the
fact that he could not see who it was
that was coming toward him made the
suspense nerve-racking

  suddenly he thought of matches he


detective story magazine

searched his pockets but the little case
in which he usually carried them was
empty somewhere in the room there
must be an electric-light switch but it
was not likely he could find it in the
dark

  he peered sharply into the blackness
now his ears caught a pawing sound
like that of some one crawling on hands
and knees he bent forward a little
shoulders squared for he knew the
prowler was only a foot or two away
evidently he hoped cole was unaware
of his entrance and expected to take his
victim by surprise

  a fumbling hand swept coles knees
and he kicked out his foot with great
force foiling the attempt to trip him
a startled yell testified to the effective-
ness of the kick but in the next instant
cole knew that his adversary had risen
to his feet and was changing his tac-
tics his fist struck out but it landed
on a body hard and firm as rock and
the only apparent result of the blow
was a stinging sensation in his knuckles
he tried to strike again but now his
shoulders were seized in a powerful
grip that pinned his arms to his side
and rendered him helpless

  coles mind worked quickly while
the enormous weight of his adversary
bore him down evidently he was a
huge man and his arms were hard as
flails even if coles hands had been
free his fists would have made no
stronger impression on the mans body
than on a wall of brick though nim-
bler and more wiry than his opponent
cole knew he could not match him in
brute strength and physical endurance
his only hope lay in releasing his arms
and striking at the fellows face batter
him into insensibility

  he writhed and wriggled in the pow-
erful embrace of the gigantic arms re-
sisting the downward pressure till he
felt as if his spine must snap inch by
inch his opponent was bending him to
his knees and all the while his arms

felt as if they were caught between
metal springs in vain he put every
ounce of strength into the struggle the
mountainous body of his adversary was
constantly forcing him downward al-
ready his knees were touching the floor
and his neck felt as if it were being
gradually wrenched out of shape

  his breath grew weak and fluttering
his heart pounded against his ribs like
a trip hammer in the blackness tiny
specks whirled before his eyes he
knew the struggle must end soon and
the realization seemed to kindle a flame
within him an idea shot like a flash
through his reeling mind

  suddenly he grew limp in the sturdy
arms of his opponent with a grunt of
satisfaction the latter let go his hold
and cole lay flat and inert on his back
for a few moments he drank huge
gulps of air into his straining lungs
then with the elastic swiftness of a
spring suddenly released he leaped to
his feet with one hand he located his
adversary with the other he drove a
savage blow straight into the mans
face

  a short cry of pain and rage broke
from the others lips his hands fum-
bled at coles throat for a strangle hold
but the merciless hammering of the lat-
ters fists drove him steadily backward
whenever his fingers tightened around
coles windpipe a rain of smashing
blows to nose and mouth forced him to
relax his hold and retreat a little
farther toward the wall cole his
strength electrified by the joy of battle
did not notice that his knuckles were
bruised time and again with a sure-
ness of aim that surprised himself he
drove them into the others torn and
mangled face already a stertorous
breathing told that his adversary was
becoming groggy cole summoned all
his strength for a final knock-out blow

  he flung his arm backward and in
the same instant the other uttered a
loud yell cole cut it short with a
the unknown seven



crashing thrust of his fist with a gasp
his opponent went to the floor for a
moment he gave himself over to the
thrill of victory but in the next instant
he was all alertness a faint click sig-
nified that the door had opened and
now several pairs of feet were stealing
swiftly across the floor

  cole whirled around on his heels but
a stalwart form collided with him
nearly sweeping him off his feet an-
other hurled himself upon him from be-
hind and a third jerked his legs from
under him with a sharp sense of
bafflement cole fell headlong to the
floor he struck out with hands and
feet fighting with desperate vehemence
determined to inflict all the injury he
could on his opponents

  but he was outnumbered three to
one and something of his strength had
been spent in the earlier encounter
defiantly he met the onslaught but he
was overpowered by numbers even-
tually they had him on his back and
then his adversaries shackled his hands
and feet with stout cord he thought
they were handling him with strange
gentleness and he wondered if they
were saving him for another ordeal
he remembered as he was picked up
and carried that miss brown had said
something about a fate worse than a
hundred deaths

  in silence the little procession passed
through a door and presently cole was
placed on a cot in a few moments the
men walked out and once more he was
left alone in impenetrable darkness
not a word had been spoken by his
captors and he had not obtained a
single glimpse of their faces the
whole episode had been enacted in
silence and under cover of darkness

  the door opened just as coles mind
was shaking off the numbness that had
seized it when he fell some one
walked up to the cot where he lay for
a few moments no sound was heard
save the slow breathing of the two men

  f-ds

finally the other spoke and cole rec-
ognized the voice of the one who had
acted as spokesman for the group
around the circular table

  youre an obstinate man mr cole
we have made you a very flattering
proposition and you have seen fit to
reject it i have come to offer you one
more chance to comply with our
wishes

  and if i refuse said cole evenly
you will kill me i suppose i am be-
ginning to think you are quite capable
of it

 oh no the other man laughed
softly we know you are not the kind
of man thats afraid of death some-
thing stronger than fear for your life
is needed to bend you to our will but
we will bend you sooner or later make
no mistake about that

  the words were spoken in a tone of
calm assurance that impressed cole
against his will

  how if i may ask

  by a form of persuasion that is far
more powerful than the fear of death
after all death is nothing only a dip
into a void a little suffering perhaps
and then nothingness there are things
that are far worse mr cole did you
ever stop to consider what your life
would amount to if you should sud-
denly lose your mind

  what cole gave an involuntary
shudder

  suppose that keen mind of yours
should become a blank suppose that
your wonderful mental faculties were
to desert you that you were to become
a leering tottering wretch inspiring
loathing and horror in your fellow men
can you picture such a fate mr cole
death would be a thousand times more
merciful yet you would lack the incen-
tive to kill yourself what could be
worse

  cole was silent the darkness gave
free rein to his imagination and the


detective story magazine

picture he saw sent a cold shiver down
his spine

  all that life means to you would be
blotted out the other went on with
remorseless eloquence instead of
matching your wits against a mans
problems as at present you would
probably be devoting your time to
childish amusements imagine yourself
placing buttons in a row and building
houses out of blocks you would be
dragging a useless and broken body
through life until-

  stop it said cole youre in
more danger of losing your mind than
i am yours is already a bit twisted
unless im mistaken

  dont fool yourself unless you
give us a reasonable guarantee that you
will comply with our wishes you will
be a grimacing lunatic by morning a
very simple operation on the brain will
do it among those seven men whom
you saw around the circular table is a
noted surgeon everything including
the ether and the instruments will be
ready in a few minutes there is still
time for you to come to your senses

  in the back of coles mind was a
hazy suspicion that he was dreaming
but the others calm and softly pene-
trating tones gave him a feeling of
reality

  you wouldnt- he began

  ah wouldnt we just wait and
see perhaps i can convince you

  cole heard his footfalls cross the
floor and then a door opened and
closed for a few minutes he was
alone trying to arrange in an orderly
process the odds and ends of the nights
amazing happenings his mind stag-
gered before the task and suddenly the
door opened again he had a vague
impression that two men were enter-
ing and that they were carrying a bur-
den between them they moved about
quickly in the darkness and now and
then they wthispered in tones so low
that cole could not hear them

  a light flashed on and in the same
instant the door closed after the long-
period of utter darkness the sudden
glare had a blinding effect cole blinked
his eyes but after a little he opened
them wide in astonishment and the
sight that met them drew a long trem-
bling gasp from his lips

  there was only one other man in the
room a shivering gibbering wreck of a
man whose grimacing features and hol-
low cackle sent a series of chill shivers
through coles body for a long time
he stared into the leering slowly twitch-
ing face before he was able to realize
that the wretch seated a few feet from
his cot was malcolm reeves

       chapter iv

yellow

           he first went to work on the
case of reeves mysterious dis-
appearance cole had been shown sev-
eral photographs of the missing man
along the numerous twistings of the
trail he had carried with him a mental
picture of a fine intellectual face deep
and rather somber eyes a long nose
whose slenderness hinted at aristocratic
breeding a clean-cut jaw that denoted
a great deal of aggressiveness and lips
that were a trifle too full and might
have suggested sensuality if the broad
slope of the forehead had not conveyed
a dominant impression of the student
and the thinker the picture in coles
mind had represented a man about fifty
years old with a virile personality and
quiet tastes

  the contrast between his mental
image of malcolm reeves and the mis-
erable creature now sitting a few feet
away was so sharp that the compari-
son gave cole a profound shock his
clothing hung loosely over his bony
frame and he seemed to have aged dec-
ades in the three weeks that had
elapsed since his disappearance his
shoulders were hunched down a little
the unknown seven



his head was bent forward and the
eyes stared rigidly into space as if he
were seeing something in the distance
his lips were twisted into a fixed va-
cant smile that impressed cole as the
most hideous thing he had ever seen

  he tried to spring from the cot mo-
mentarily forgetting that his arms and
legs were bound he sank back with a
mutter of exasperation not much
imagination was required to guess that
the men who had brought about his
own plight were also responsible for the
condition of malcolm reeves

  again something drew his glance to
the insane man the revolting picture
seemed to hold cole with an uncanny
fascination whats happened he
inquired realizing a moment later that
he might as well have addressed a
wooden image

  reeves was still gazing fixedly at
the opposite wall there was a look
of insane glee in his shrunken eyes he
bent forward a little more and then his
lips began to move yellow he said
pretty yellow

  the soft-spoken words and the gig-
gle that followed caused cole to shud-
der he could see that reeves mind
or the pitiful remnant of it was revel-
ing in some childish fancy the wreck-
age of a once splendid intellect was hor-
rible to behold

  what do you see he asked won-
dering whether the man was capable
of any form of response

  the others face brightened but cole
thought it was only an external glow
a reflected light rather than one kindled
from within he recoiled inwardly as
another stream of giggling mirth
flowed from the insane mans lips

  yellow said reeves again pretty
yellow

  his expression became more rapt
his smile grew broader and deeper but
to cole it seemed nothing more than a
contortion of facial muscles he won-

dered whether the two words were all
that was left of the mans vocabulary
he felt a desire to test him and see if
there was not a remaining scrap of in-
tellect that could be aroused

  listen mr reeves he said
sharply when did you last see pro-
fessor carmody

  the giggling ended in a quick in-
take of breath reeves smile faded as
abruptly as if an invisible hand had
blotted it out watching him intently
cole could see that his question had
touched a slumbering chord in the mans
mind fear and something akin to hate
blazed in the shrunken eyes it was a
startling transformation and cole ob-
served it in wonder he had men-
tioned carmodys name on the spur of
a vagrant impulse wondering whether
it would awaken a recollection in the
debris of reeves intellect the effect
was far beyond his expectations

  carmody said the insane man and
each syllable cut like a knife through
the silence carmody

  he drew a shaking hand across his
brow and cole fancied something was
stirring in the dark corners of his mind
his face took on a strained look as if
he was trying to exercise the shattered
remnants of his intellect there was a
flicker of returning sanity a feeble ray
of awakening reason

  it did not last long reeves gave a
little shudder there was a trembling
gleam in his eye then the fatuous grin
came back to his lips and once more he
mumbled in rapt tones yelknv
pretty yellow

  cole turned his head away with a
shiver his experiment had shown the
hopelessness of the insane mans con-
dition but it had also suggested several
things to cole a recollection of a ter-
rifying nature seemed to be buried in
the wreckage of reeves mind and evi-
dently it had something to do with pro-
fessor carmody cole had felt certain
for a long time that the professor was


detective story magazine

responsible for the mans disappear-
ance but he had not cared to jeopardize
his case by taking action before he had
sufficient evidence in his possession as
a premature move on his part might
have brought disastrous results at that
time he had not been sure whether the
missing man was dead or alive if still
living his safety might be endangered
by hasty action for carmody would
not hesitate to kill him if he thought it
advisable so cole had waited pa-
tiently biding his time and slowly but
surety strengthening the meshes in
which he hoped to entangle the pro-
fessor

  now cole wondered to what extent
his course had been correct the
maniacs startling reaction to the men-
tion of carmodys name seemed to con-
firm at least a part of his theory  what
he could not understand was how
reeves granting that the professor was
responsible for his abduction happened
to be in this place of dark intrigue and
baffling mystery evidently there must
be a connecting link between professor
carmody and the seven masked men
who had sat around the circular table
likely as not they were accomplices
banded together for the attainment of
some secret object that would at
least explain why the seven men were
so determined that cole should drop the
carmody case though it explained
nothing else

  a slight sound interrupted the specu-
lations with which he had tried to re-
lieve the tension he felt he turned his
head a little and saw that the door had
opened a crack a hand was inserted
through the narrow opening for a
moment i fumbled over the wall then
came a faint click and once more the
room was dark men were moving
about in the blackness for a time and
then all was quiet the silence seemed
to indicate that cole was alone in the
room but he had an indefinable feeling
that some one was standing beside his

cot in a moment his impression was
confirmed

  mr cole said a voice and he rec-
ognized it at once i trust that what
you have just seen has put you in a
more reasonable frame of mind un-
less you comply with our wishes we
shall do to you what we did to malcolm
reeves

  cole strained spasmodically against
the cords that fettered his hands and
feet in the darkness his imagination
sketched a picture of reeves hideously
grinning face for a moment he could
almost hear the maniacs insane cackle
he banished the vision by sheer force
of will

  theres a great deal of finesse about
your methods he ironically observed
i guessed of course that reeves was
brought in here to serve as an objcct
lesson to me it was quite impressive
and you have reconsidered asked
the other hopefully

  cole lay absolutely still on his back
it was all he could do to exclude the
disturbing pictures of reeves from his
mind whenever a glimpse of it came
back to him he felt a weakness that put
him in fear of himself not exactly
he managed to say in steady tones i
have merely been taking my own meas-
ure as it were trying to determine
whether the loss of pride and self-
respect is worse than the loss of ones
sanity

  and what is your conclusion

  i am still in doubt there are so
many ways of looking at the situation
for instance one thing to be considered
is that lost self-respect may be re-
gained while insanity is in most in-
stances incurable

  excellent murmured the other
thats a very rational way of looking
at the proposition such being the case
it should not be difficult for you to
choose between the two alternatives
but it is protested cole there
is still another thing to be considered
the unknown seven



suppose i were to accept your terms
all i could give you would be my word
of honor that i would live up to them
quite sufficient the other put in
we know you are not the kind of man
who goes back on his word

  thanks said cole sarcastically
just the same ones word of honor is
a rather intangible thing you cant
bind me with a contract it would not
be legal no matter how ingeniously
worded and it might incriminate your-
selves i am not in position to give
you any pledges you would have to
be content with my bare promise it
would be sufficient in any ordinary
case but circumstances alter every-
thing i realize i am at the mercy of
a gang of unprincipled scoundrels
your epithets dont hurt us in the
least remarked the other man icily

  didnt expect they would but dont
you see that under the circumstances i
would have no hesitancy at all about
giving you a promise that i didnt in-
tend to keep i am not a bit quixotic
and i am too practical to indulge in
cheap heroics i have no ambition to
become the hero of a tawdry melo-
drama in order to escape a fate like
the one you inflicted on reeves i would
promise anything and so would every
other men wrhose head isnt full of
moonshine you follow me
perfectly you are trying to make
out that we have no hold over you
your reasoning isnt bad but you for-
get one thing as it happens we are
in a position to exact a pledge from
you one that will hold you to us for
life

  what is it

  the other gave a soft laugh you
saw what a hopeless case reeves is
theres no reason why he should go
on living any longer the merciful
thing to do is to put him out of his
misery

 you mean-

  exactly mr cole you are to seal

the promise you give us by hustling
reeves off to a better world we have
planned it so that we will be able to
prove that you killed him having in-
criminated yourself to that extent and
with the evidence in our possession we
need have no fear that you will go back
on your word of honor and now that
we thoroughly understand each other
i must ask you to decide promptly
our time is valuable

  a few moments passed in silence but
to cole they were like weeks never
before in all his life had so many
thoughts and emotions been crowded
into such a narrow space of time he
felt weak and shaken when it was over
but his voice was clear my answer is
no he declared if i were able i
would give it to you in a more emphatic
manner

  sorry mr cole replied the other
i wont accept your decision as final
however i trust you will reconsider
before you become unconscious under
the ether

  with that he went out leaving an
ominous silence behind him cole tore
frantically at the cords around his
wrists but they only cut the deeper into
his flesh he could see no escape from
the awful fate that awaited him time
and again the picture of reeves fatu-
ously grinning face came back to him
causing him to writhe in mental tor-
ment a tempting voice seemed to
whisper in his ear turning his thoughts
into strange channels to end a life
that was worse than a living death ap-
peared not such a dreadful thing to do
cole himself would have preferred to
die rather than suffer a fate like
reeves if he should ever fall into
such a condition he would consider the
man a benefactor who ended his
misery

 he shook himself violently a
clammy perspiration was bathing his
forehead with a mental and physical
paroxysm he brushed away the tempta-


detective story magazine

tion to which he had nearly yielded a
moment ago footsteps were approach-
ing the door and he knew a critical
moment was at hand something within
him that was stronger than reason and
logic shrank from the mere thought of
taking reeves life he wondered if
there was no other alternative

  he tried to take a calm view of the
situation though his hands and feet
were tightly bound his persecutors evi-
dently had not thought it necessary to
strap him to the cot since he would
soon be under the influence of the ether
by experimenting he found that he
could turn over on his sides and thanks
to the fact that his hands had been tied
in front instead of behind he was able
to move his arms up and down and in
a horizontal direction since he could
not use his hands he did not see how
he could turn this circumstance to his
advantage yet it continued to tantalize
his imagination

  the door opened and his ears told
him that several men were entering the
room for a time they moved about
in the darkness as if making prepara-
tions of some sort after a little the
footsteps receded and then the door
opened and closed once more cole
guessed that all but one or two of the
men had withdrawn after another
brief delay the lights flashed on once
more this time illuminating a different
scene

  reeves was back in the room oc-
cupying the same chair in which he had
sat the other time but now his limbs
were as tightly manacled as coles own
he moved his head slowly from side to
side as if sensing something unusual in
the air but his vacant stare showed that
he had not the faintest inkling of what
was going on

  after a glance at him cole looked
away not far from the cot stood a
tall man with a black beard that cov-
ered nearly his entire face he was
holding a number of surgical imple-

ments to the hght giving each one a
critical inspection before he placed it
on a small table with a glass top that
stood beside the cot cole could not re-
strain a shudder as he saw how calmly
the man examined the sinister-iooking
little tools there was a professional
air about him that in coles mind
stamped him as a surgeon

  again his glance moved to the insane
man whose dull gaze seemed to be tak-
ing in each detail of the scene the
meaning of the little knives and the
presence of the black-bearded man was
terrifyingly clear

  the surgeon placed the last of the
knives on the table beside the cot they
lay there in plain view so close to cole
that if his hands had been free he could
have reached out and touched them
the long slender metal blades gleamed
diabolically in the electric lights and he
wondered if they had been placed like
that for the sole purpose of impressing
their hideous significance upon him

  the black-bearded man came closer
to the cot and cole caught a full view
of his face he had seen it once before
though only dimly for the surgeon was
one of the seven who had sat in the
dusk at the circular table he had worn
a mask then but the black beard the
high forehead and the bald spot on top
of his head were unmistakable now
his features were unveiled and in this
circumstance cole saw a grim signifi-
cance the surgeon no longer had any
reason to fear that cole might recog-
nize him if they should meet again

  he stopped beside the glass-topped
table and with hands clasped at his
back fixed a tranquil gaze on the re-
clining man you have one more
chance mr cole he remarked in a
casual tone hadnt you better recon-
sider your refusal 

  cole looked up into the bearded face
with a feeling that there was something
peculiar about it but his mind was too
agitated to analyze the impression in
the unknown seven



a playful manner the surgeon picked up
one of the knives holding it so that the
light flashed against the keen blade

  cole was trying to frame an answer
but just then something drew his gaze
to the insane man reeves was strain-
ing forward in his chair bending his
weight against the fettering cords
from where he sat he had a clear view
of both cole and the surgeon and his
eyes were fixed with wild intensity on
the knife in the latters hand time
and again he opened his lips but the
only sound that came was a hoarse
rattle in his throat

  well mr cole 

  the surgeon paying no attention to
the lunatic looked impatiently at cole
reeves with mouth gaping and fea-
tures horribly distorted continued to
stare at the knife

  you refuse the surgeon waited
a moment longer for an answer then
with a shrug he replaced the knife and
stepped aside cole felt a sudden rush
of blood to his head if he was to
escape a fate worse than death he must
act at once he spurred his wits to
think of something to do a tinkling
like that of a jar or a bottle being
moved sounded in the room again
he bent his mind to the seemingly hope-

less task of finding a way out but even
in this moment of desperate peril he
could not take his gaze from the insane
mans face

  reeves sat with shoulders hunched
up and head turned a little to one side
now and then his mouth twisted at the
corners from time to time a shudder
broke the tension of his figure a
series of slight gurgling sounds fell on
the stillness at intervals all the while
his eyes with a smoldering something
in their depths were fixed on the knives
spread out on the glass-topped table

  suddenly coles body executed a
little writhing motion his nostrils
sucked in a strong sickening odor
with a sponge in his hand the surgeon
was coming toward the cot

  once more in a delirium of suspense
cole glanced at the insane man the
quick dilation of reeves nostrils told
he also had noticed the ether the
chair creaked as he bent his weight
against the cords there was a look on
his face that cole felt would follow him
through the night of madness that
threatened to engulf him reeves
chest heaved violently his whole body
seemed to be rocked by a tumultuous
emotion and finally a long and oddly
vibrant cry broke from his lips

ielaxed comfortably in the
depths of a big leather chair
in the luxurious lobby of the
achmore hotel mr amos
clackworthy sighed in deep content-
ment he had just finished a meal
which exactly suited his epicurean
tastes the early bird had shared the
same delicious meal but food could not
appease his gnawing appetite for an
adventure it had been some weeks now
since the master confidence man had
engaged in that always interesting pas-
time of dollar hunting

  ah james murmured mr clack-
worthy that filet of sole was ambrosia
fit for the gods

  huh grunted the early bird
th kinda fish im interested in right
now is-suckers come on boss bait
th hook an lets give some dollar-
grabbin goof th chance t nibble

  mr clack worthy smiled tolerantly
james he complained good-
naturedly you are certainly a restless
soul it seems that you can never de-
clare a truce with careless bank bal-
ances

  aw whats th use of havin a wise
noodle like yours if you dont use it
when a guys got a money-makin
think-tank lies gotta keep it oiled or
its gonna get rusty

  unfortunately james and the
master confidence man smiled i do
seem to get a bit rusty at times just
now for instance i have thumbed my

list of prospects in vain i dont seem
to be able to get hold of a single lead
at that i am not sorry for i am get-
ting terribly behind in my reading

  the early bird groaned as there
arose before him the dismal picture of
mr clackworthy sitting in the library
of his sheridan road apartment for
countless hours nose buried between
the covers of some classical volume he
was very jealous of the masters for
they took much of the time which so
james told himself could be so much
more profitably turned to more practi-
cal matters

  however what further entreaty the
early bird might have been about to
make was abruptly sidetracked as his
gaze wandered to the hotel entrance
and paused at the sight of an arriving
guest

  holy pink elephants he exclaimed
in mr clack worthys ear theres
chicago charlie  he must be gettin
up in th world stoppin at this swell
joint

  one of your erstwhile friends i
presume james responded mr clack-
worthy he referred to his coworkers
former days when the early bird was
not above burgling a safe or turning
his hand to various other violent means
of annexing the coin which are frowned
upon by the law

  friend sputtered the early bird
boss of course i forgive you for you
dont know chicago charlie but that is

m
mr clackworthy goes to jail



sure an insult that guy a friend of
mine aintcha ever heard of chicago
charlie but then i forgot that you
didnt used t pal around with th same
bunch i did

  honest boss ive got every respect
in th world for a square crook y know
what i mean but that goof is so
crooked that hed make a corkscrew
look as straight as a yardstick hes
so crooked hes gotta read a paper up-
side down alongside chicago charlie
jesse james would of got a bid t this
here diogenes guys party fer honest
homos

  your vehemence piques my inter-
est mr clackworthy chuckled cast-
ing a glance of interest to the big
heavy-jowled man who had now
reached the clerks desk and was writ-
ing his name in the hotel register
suppose you tell me something about
him i judge that he must have-er
-nicked you for your roll as you
would say

  ive sure got th old bowie knife all
whetted up for that guy said the
early bird th only time i ever beat
th ponies for a hundred-to-one shot
this here charlie was makin book out
t th old chicago race track a friend
slips me some live dope about a little
spindle-legged filly what looked like she
was sufferin from th sleepin sickness
so i parks a century into chicago
charlies keepin an believe me boss
them was th days when a five spot
looked as big as th state of kansas

  well this little mare grasshopper
gets t th home stretch about three
train lengths ahead of th field an i
stands t collect ten thousand smackers
from chicago charlies betting empo-
rium does i get it huh i got it all
right-in th neck charlie skips out
an grabs th first rattler for parts un-
known i dont even get my century
back

  aw i aint th only guy that was
handed th double cross by him be-

fore he blowed th race track that time
hed been mixed up in a coupla dozen
crooked races

  it must have been some years then
since you have seen him remarked
mr clackworthy it does credit to
your memory james if i am any
judge this charlie person has now
risen considerably above the level of a
crooked bookmaker he carries him-
self with that assurance which belongs
to a man of affairs

  well y can lay good odds that hes
with a gang of counterfeiters or head
of a trust whats got th monopoly on
stealin pennies outta blind mens cups
or somethin like that retorted the
early bird spitefully he was staring
at chicago charlies luggage his brow
wrinkled in deep thought

  if he aint swiped some goofs bag-
gage-which wouldnt surprise me none
-hes changed his moniker he said
see them initials-j h they says
an in th days when i knowed him his
name was charlie batterson yeah
thems his grips awright hes point-
in em out t th bell hop it says j
m swaneetown indiana 

  mr clackworthy referred to his
carefully card-indexed memory

  swaneetown eh he murmured
if i mistake not james that is the
name of the town which has enjoyed
such a spectacular boom of late a
number of factories have erected large
plants there it is something less than
a hundred miles from here i believe
no doubt james charlie is doing quite
well humph

  the master confidence man lowered
his eyelids meditatively and thought-
fully tugged at the neatly trimmed
point of his vandyke beard

  james he said slowly it may be
that our dining here this evening was
nothing short of providential who
knows but that we may be able to find
a way whereby we can collect this old
debt which chicago charlie owes you-


detective story magazine

with appropriate interest and-humph
-an adequate fee for my services as a
collector

  boss exclaimed the early bird
eagerly y aint stringin me hon-
est boss will ya throw th old harpoon
into that guy will ya

  its a bad idea james to weigh
your fish before you have so much as
baited your hook responded mr
clackworthy cautiously but we most
certainly shall look into this little
matter

ii

  chicago charlie has certainly de-
veloped into a most shrewd person re-
marked mr clackworthy as from the
window in his room of the swanee-
town house he stared across the non-
descript business street which was clut-
tered with all sorts of building material
such as marks a growing town in the
making

  meanin said the early bird with
a discouraged sigh that you aint been
able t figger out th ways an means ol
liftin a bunch of his kale

  you have correctly stated the mat-
ter james replied the master confi-
dence man but to paraphrase a bit of
sound philosophy where there is money
there is always hope-of getting some
of it

  i have now spent some hours mak-
ing guarded inquiries regarding our
debtor as you know he has buttoned
the cloak of respectability tightly about
his shoulders he has taken unto him-
self the name of john harley and he
is president of the bank of swanee-
town he came here when the boom
started and purchased considerable
portions of real estate for practically a
song

  he lias become a power in munici-
pal politics through his money and the
strangle hold which he has gotten 
local affairs i understand that all of
the city officials literally eat from his

hand in addition to being president
of the bank he has numerous other in-
vestments he has developed into a
shrewd business man and not any too
scrupulous i take it

  he is i judge an extremely sus-
picious man which will make it very
difficult for me to win his confidence-
the first necessity of course if i am to
reduce the plethora of his roll

  so y gotta call it off huh the
early bird said mournfully

  did you ever know me to quit
james reproved mr clackworthy
i did not intend to deluge your hopes
with the cold water of discouraging
facts i merely reported the situation
as i have found it it really makes the
game only the more interesting i have
not quit old dear i have just begun

  these facts which i have recited to
you i have gathered about town i am
going over to harleys bank-we might
as well respect his alias for the present
-and open up an account

  gonna put your kale in chicago
charlies bank demanded the early
bird doncha do it we come down
here t trim him not t let him trim us
remember what i told y about him
goin south with my ten thousand
smackers keep your dough in your
own kick its safer

  tut james the bank is perfectly
safe all banks are protected by state
guarantees these days and a clever
fellow like chicago charlie isnt going
to risk wrecking a bank ill be back
presently and i may perchance have
discovered his vulnerable point
following the principle that nothing
succeeds like success mr clackworthy
had long since discovered that the most
powerful magnet to attract money was
-money in pursuance thereof he had
brought along a generous working capi-
tal

  entering the bank of swaneetown
the master confidence man found john
harley seated in front of an elaborate
mr clack worthy goes to jail



mahogany desk within the open brass-
railed space adjoining the tellers cages
the banker who had once answered to
the name of chicago charlie was a big
heavy-jawed man florid and beefy he
had learned the trick of narrowing his
eyes to mere slits until he was like a
man peering through a crack in a win-
dow blind he could look into a face
without giving any hint of his own
emotions it rather gave the impres-
sion of a man asleep except for the
glinting of the light against his cur-
tained retina his mind was very much
awake

 my name is clackworthy ex-
plained the master confidence man i
wish to open an account with your
bank it will be small for the present
-only ten thousand dollars

  check demanded the self-styled
mr harvey with bankerlike caution
unintroduced strangers who opened ac-
counts with checks were of course
open to inquiry

  cash replied mr clackworthy
just as briefly

  aw right said harley glad to
have your account thinking of going
into business in swaneetown

  that remains to be decided mr
clackworthy smiled he was aware
that chicago charlie through his half-
closed eyes was subjecting him to the
most minute scrutiny and he realized
with a vague feeling of discouragement
that fooling chicago charlie was going
to prove a difficult task the man was
without doubt suspicious and practical
he had learned caution in the hard
school of life where the lessons are not
easily forgotten

  and had he known the thorough-
ness of the bankers classification mr
clackworthy would have been still
further discouraged

  a fox this fellow was harleys
appraisal cant sell him any real
estate at inflated values cant sell him
any stock that isnt on the level cant

be picked for a sucker no use wasting
any time on him

  which was a disappointment to chi-
cago charlie every newcomer who de-
posited money in the bank of swanee-
town was at once sized up with a view
to swelling the size of the harley ex-
chequer straightway he decided that
it was going to be a cold day in august
when he would try to do business with
this mr clackworthy

  and the master confidence man with
that intuitive sixth sense of his real-
ized at least a small part of chicago
charlies skittish distrust it would
have to be a most unusual trap indeed
that would lure banker harley

iii

  it really could not be considered
strange inasmuch as the early bird
had instantly recognized chicago
charlie after nearly fifteen years that
chicago charlie in turn should recog-
nize the early bird the bank presi-
dent had dropped into the swaneetown
house for lunch

  glancing across the dining room he
nodded politely to mr clackworthy as
is due a man who has deposited ten
thousand dollars in cash the day before
almost at the same instant he got a
good look at mr clackworthys com-
panion he started unpleasantly

  the early bird he murmured for
james early had after all changed
very little since the time when the police
were considerably interested in his
movements and when james with the
capital which he had secured through
extremely dubious methods had been a
regular patron at the race track

  now the self-styled john harley con-
gratulated himself that he had success-
fully erased the unsavory pages of his
past in physical appearance he had
changed a good deal his body had
thickened his face was more full older
after his sudden disappearance from


detective story magazine

his betting stall at the chicago race
track he had gone far west he thought
that he had thoroughly done away with
chicago charlie as he stared covertly
at the early bird he detected the
early bird looking just as covertly at
him and something told him that there
was recognition in james eyes

  the early bird pressed mr clack-
worthys foot beneath the table

  hes lamped me boss he whis-
pered hes jerry t me

  mr clackworthy frowned in annoy-
ance he had thoughtlessly neglected to
take into consideration the possibility
that chicago charlie would dine at their
hotel it had not been his intention
that the banker should see him and his
coworker together

  banker harley hurried through his
meal keeping his face averted he left
the hotel and went back to his bank
for half an hour he sat pudgy hands
folded across his expansive waistcoat
chewing a dead cigar he was thinking
many unpleasant thoughts

  it was of course possible that he
had been mistaken that the early
bird had not recognized him at all
also it was barely possible that the
early bird carried with him no spirit
of revengeand perhaps even forgotten
the incident of the welched hundred-to-
one shot so many years before

  and what if the early bird had not
forgotten or forgiven and did tell what
he knew  he could brazen it out deny
that he was the former race-track
booky in case the early bird did
show a vindictive spirit surely his
word would be accepted against that
of a former safe blower but even at
the best it was an unpleasant business
would shake the local confidence in his
bank if the story got abroad if the
story was believed it might even force
his resignation as president of the in-
stitution

  the crux of the whole trouble the
thing that made it so dangerous was

that chicago charlie had not always
been so wise and so cautious as he now
was he had done some very foolish
things at various and sundry times with
the result that the police had mugged
him if the thing got far enough for

that to leak out- he shuddered at

the thought

  presently banker harley arrived at
a decision and reached for the tele-
phone and called swaneetown twenty
which was the police station he even
chucklcd a little at the cleverness of his
inspiration

  givney he said to the chief of
police i want you to come over to the
bank right away

  chief givney came and lost no time
about it harveys political machine
had put him in office the banker led
givney back to the private office and
closed the door

  givney he grunted you want to
continue to hold your job dont you
the chief looking a bit frightened
nodded vigorously

  aw right givney its up to you
you do what i say-and keep your
mouth shut understand again the
chief nodded

  now givney you listen to me and
do what i tell you your job depends
on it

  givney listened

iv

  boss said the early bird as he
and mr clackworthy sat in the lobby
of the swaneetown house somethin
seems t tell me that we aint gonna
trim chicago charlie for so much as a
solitary lincoln les grab th rattler
for th big burg

  not for another day or so james
responded mr clackworthy we must
not accept defeat so easily i will ad-
mit-

  he paused as a man sauntered up to
them
mr clackworthy goes to jail



  beg your pardon said the stranger
you two fellows look as if time were
hanging heavily on your hands and im
trying to drum up a little poker game
oh im not a professional three of the
boys are willing but three-handed draw
is a little like tiddlewinks you know
thought id invite you to sit in

  mr clackworthy gave the man a
swift glance of appraisal certainly he
was not a professional card sharper
and besides he was himself no novice at
the game he liked poker and it of-
fered a welcomed opportunity to pass
away a few hours

  what do you say james he asked
of his coworker

  the early bird eagerly assented for
he was no slouch with the cards even
in a professional game

  i gotcha he said im gonna get
th chance t make expenses on this trip
anyhow lead th way

  mr clack worthy however became
suddenly alert as he noted the look of
satisfaction which flashed over the
strangers face he felt instinctively
that there was something behind it his
curiosity overcame any cautious mis-
givings he felt the stranger led the
way upstairs and to one of the ordinary
guest rooms presently two others
joined the party and the game got
under way as poker games go it was
a rather tame business

  the five had been playing less than
an hour when there was a rap at the
door one of the players got from his
chair and turned back the key in-
stantly the door was shoved open and
chief of police givney faced the five
players in all of his official sternness

  youre pinched he announced for
gamblin line up there as soon as i
get this here evidence together we go
down to th station

  now dont that beat the devil ex-
claimed the early bird caught with
th goods-an me winner enough t buy
th tickets home

  mr clackworthy knew that it was a
frame-up he and the early bird had
been deliberately led into this game for
the purpose of arrest but as quick as he
was at probing situations he admitted
that the motive proved too deep for
him the other three players took the
matter cheerfully enough as became
true sports and the journey was begun
to the police station

  at the station all five were booked
and motioned to a bench

  i aint goin to lock you fellows up
he explained ill take you over to the
police magistrate want t call a law-
yer it aint much use i got you with
th evidence an youll draw fines any-
how

  the police magistrates office was di-
rectly across the street and presently
chief givney led them thither

  the arraignment proceeded as is cus-
tomary in such cases as chief givney
formally presented his charge dis-
played the evidence and giving his de-
tails of his raid-made he explained
when a guest in the adjoining room had
notified him over the telephone that a
game was in progress quite naturally
the five prisoners had no defense

  the magistrate a pompous man who
took his judicial duties with great seri-
ousness glared down upon the five of-
fenders

  theres been too much gamblin go-
in on in this town he declared with a
nasal twang ive got to take harsh
measures to stamp out this evil now
three of these prisoners is home boys
their faces is familiar i fine these
three-and he read off their names-
ten dollars an costs

  promptly the three guilty men pro-
duced pocketbooks and paid their fines

  and now went on the magistrate
lets see about these other two
strangers in swaneetown huh pro-
fessional gamblers like as not

  the early bird enjoying the humor
of the situation shook his head mr
so

detective story magazine

clackworthy likewise denied the im-
putation that he was a professional
gambler

  youd lie about it anyhow retorted
the judge witheringly now this man
here has got a hard face-a hard face
he pointed an accusing finger at the
early bird he looks like a criminal
t me

  chief givney stared intently at
james and simulated a start of sur-
prise

  your honor he said you are
right this man is a criminal i re-
member seem his picture in th rogues
gallery in chicago ive got a good
memory i can even tell you his name
he give th name of brown when i
arrested him his names james early
alias th early bird hes-a desprit
character

  the early birds face paled slightly
at this sudden turn of events mr
clackworthy a police prisoner for the
first time in his life began to under-
stand that chicago charlie was at the
bottom of this he had of course in-
spired the raid on the poker game and
had supplied givney with what was
now ancient history concerning his co-
worker but what was chicago
charlies game he could not quite
fathom it

  what have you to say for your-
self the magistrate inquired crisply
the early bird floundered for a reply

  ive pleaded guilty t gamblin aint
i he demanded weakly im willin
to fork up th coin for th fine aint
that enough

  i havent indicated that i would let
you off with a fine retorted th judge
the penalty for this offense is a fine
of not less than five dollars nor more
than one hundred dollars or a jail sen-
tence of ninety days or both and
dont you talk back to this court have
you got a police record

  i-i want a lawyer stanrnered

the early bird i aint gettin an
even break i refuse to answer

  its too late for a lawyer now de-
creed the judge youve already
pleaded guilty you cant even appeal
from a plea of guilty so you refuse
to answer eh that means its so

  you and this other prisoner here
are together huh  i guess youre both
crooks-you look it if it wasnt for
puttin the county to th expense -or
feedin a couple of city crooks id give
you both the limit we dont want
crooks like you in our town

  i fine you each one hundred dollars
and costs and three months in jail-and
set aside the sentence providin that
you buy tickets to chicago and that th
chief of police secs you off on the four
oclock train call next case

  the early bird breathed a sigh of
relief he hadnt realized that a poker
game could have such threateningly
dangerous consequences mr clack-
worthy however refused to let the
matter end there

  if the court please he said calmly
i deny your right to attempt to drive
my friend and me from town in this
fashion i have a right to remain here
and i shall-even if it be in jail

  the early bird stared at mr clack-
worthy in horror

  boss he whispered hoarsely
youve gone off your onion for th

love of pete-

  mr clackworthy smiled cheerfully
wake up james he murmured
dont you see through it chicago
charlie did this-hes afraid of us
weve got him where we want him
hes furnished me with a plan and i
think were going to collect after all
ive never been in jail before old dear
but i wouldnt let chicago charlie get
away with this-not for a year in jail
the judge after sputtering for one
speechless moment at mr clack-
worthys surprising stand found voice
lock him up he ordered
mr clackworthy goes to jail



 v

  the early bird as he always did
bowed to mr clackworthys wishes
and likewise refused to shake the dust
of swaneetown from his new twenty-
dollar patent-leather shoes however
he was forlorn when he learned that he
must bide his time to be taken into his
masters confidence as to the motive of
his practically voluntary incarceration
they were locked in separate cells

  as the steel door clanged shut behind
him mr clackworthy through the
bars proffered the turnkey a neatly
folded twenty-dollar bill

   i want a little information he said
i want to know what kind of a lawyer
edward stone is

  punk replied the turnkey hes
just a young fellow and pretty near
starvin to death i reckon

  what relationship has he to henry
stone publisher of the swaneetown
courier

  brothers they are

  so i guessed mr clackworthy
nodded call up lawyer stone for me
and tell him that theres a hundred-
dollar retainer fee waiting for him the
minute he gets here

  then hell get here before i can get
the receiver hung up shrewdly replied
the turnkey

  the prediction may have failed by a
few minutes but lawyer stone did not
waste any time he came back to mr
clackworthys cell a neatly shabby man
of perhaps thirty he took the hun-
dred-dollar bill which air clackworthy
gave him fingering it fondly

  stone began the master confidence
man your brother owns the cou-
rier

  yes but-

   i happened to be looking over it back
in the hotel this morning i saw your
name in the news columns and the boost
the paper gave you made me lean to
the conclusion that he must be your

brother no dont interrupt all of this
is quite pertinent

  let me ask you another question
how does your brother and banker
harley get along

  you say this is-pertinent ex-
claimed the attorney maybe so any-
how youve given me a hundred and
i dont know any easier way to earn
it than hand you out the family secrets
henry has to get along with harley
harley has a mortgage on the paper
and the paper isnt exactly a news-
paper bonanza i take it went on mr
clackworthy the lack of advertis-
ing patronage would indicate that your
brother is having a tough time of it
it does look rather sickly doesnt
it agreed the lawyer say whats
the idea anyhow

  for answer mr clackworthy drew
closer to the barred door and whispered
into lawyer stones ear for several
minutes when he had finished the at-
torney was grinning

  ill talk it over with henry he
said i am dead sure hell do it it
will save the paper for him henry
would commit murder for three thou-
sand dollars right now he hasnt been
able to rake up last weeks pay roll
that same afternoon less than three
hours after the young lawyers consul-
tation with mr clackworthy small
boys began to flood the streets of
swaneetown with handbills they
read

a great sensation

  the courier takes pleasure in announcing
that in its issue to-morrow and running
every week thereafter it will begin the pub-
lication of a sensation series of articles ex-
posing the inside secrets of crookcd race
track gambling entitled

from bookmaker to bank presi-
dent

  we guarantee that this series of articles
will stir swaneetown as  other series of
newspaper article has ever done it will
describe how a former racc-track gambler


detective story magazine

who served several jail terms for a number
of offenses changed his name accumulated
a fortune and became president of a bank

it starts to-morrow

  banker harley otherwise chicago
charlie was at his desk when some one
coming in from the street carried in
one of the bills his eyes lighted on
the line in big type from book-
maker to bank president
he gave a violent start and with trem-
bling fingers began to read

  he had already been informed of
course that mr clackworthy and the
early bird had refused to leave town
that of course puzzled and worried
him but this how had they done it
there was one consoling thought he
could stop the courier from printing
it he reached for the phone and called
the courier office

  stone he snapped into the trans-
mitter you owe this bank a mort-
gage for three thousand dollars on your
paper it was due to-day and you
havent paid it ill have to foreclose
unless you meet that mortgage

  why mr harley exclaimed
stone with apparent innocence why
are you so sudden about it

  i think you already know retorted
the banker any man whos loon
enough to flood the town with a lot of
ridiculous bills like youre having dis-
tributed this afternoon isnt sane
enough to get credit at this bank of
course if you stopped this foolishness
i might--

  but i couldnt do that mr harley
replied the editor ive advertised it
you know and-well besides i was
just on my way down to pay off the
mortgage i have made other financial
arrangements - borrowed the money
from a-a mr amos clackworthy
ive got his check drawn on your bank
ill be right down

  chicago charlie dropped limply back
in his chair

vi

  being a man of average intelligence
chicago charlie did not need a diagram
to tell him what had happened to him
and he wasted no time he had a situa-
tion to meet and he met it he hurried
to police headquarters and flung him-
self down into the chair at chief giv-
neys desk

  givney he commanded get an
order from the court and bring those
two prisoners over here from the jail
-and then go away and let us alone
understand 

  the chief obediently brought mr
clackworthy and the early bird from
their cells in the jail and conducted
them to his private office

  beat it givney shut the door be-
hind you ordered chicago charlie
sit down you two he went on as the
door slammed sit down and talk
turkey youve got me hooked an i
know it

  i thought id run you out of town
it didnt work you two came out here
to get me i understand it now-and
you put it over theres no use raisin
a fuss about that part of it the ques-
tion is-how much do you want 

  the early bird who a moment be-
fore had been the glummest man in
seven states stared in amazed delight
at mr clackworthy somehow mr
clackworthy had put it over

  i guess you aint forgot them ten
thousand smackers of mine that you
went south with eh chicago charlie
james inquired gleefully

  the banker winced unpleasantly at
the name which he had not heard for
many years

  cut out that stuff he ordered
im willin to pay a reasonable amount
of blackmail to you twro-

  blackmail interrupted mr clack-
worthy i am quite sure that neither
james here nor myself have any inten-
tion of blackmailing you
mr clackworthy goes to jail



   then what do you call it id like
to know

 now come-er-charlie and mr
clackworthy smiled suppose we put
this on a strictly business basis you
are indebted to mr early in the sum
of ten thousand dollars a debt which
has been unpaid for more than ten
years the interest on that straight in-
terest at six per cent amounts to more
than six thousand dollars should wte
compound it and most certainly it
should be compounded it would reach
a very large sum however i am sure
that he will waive compound interest if
you in turn would allow him some-
thing for-the-er-expenses of collec-
tion

  surely there is no blackmail in a
straightforward business proposition of
this character speaking as mr earlys
representative i offer you a settlement
figure of twenty-live thousand dollars
not a penny less-er-charlie take it
or leave it just as you choose

  cut it half in two twelve thousand
five hundred parried the banker

  not a cent for bargaining refused
mr clackworthy

  howre you goin to call off your
dogs demanded chicago charlie
how are you going to shut up that
newspaper i guess he knows the
whole thing too eh

 not a word denied mr clack-
worthy in fact mr early here has
not yet written his series of sensational
articles and editor stone rather adver-
tised them blind that is to say he ac-
cepted a gift of three thousand dollars
from me given under the condition that

he accepts my-er-suggestion that he
popularize his paper with a touch of
-ah-sensationalism of course he
may guess at a thing or two but so far
he knows absolutely nothing

  all right brusquely interrupted
chicago charlie i know when im
licked ive got to cough up come on
down to the bank just as soon as i
have the judge lift the sentences but
you ought to be in the pen--you black-
mailers

  mr clackworthy chuckled

  you know-er-charlie he said
you brought the whole thing on your-
self you forced us to the one method
of-er-collection that we would have
never thought of the early bird
would never have exposed you-not in
a thousand years he doesnt play the
game that way but you didnt know
that you got worried and tried to
drive us out of town if it hadnt been
for that i would have never known
that you were scared to death of a-
what the early bird would call a
squawk i had about given you up as
a bad job if you had let us alone we
would have left town to-morrow and
you would be twenty-five thousand to
the good

  come on boss save th chin music
until after ive got that jack in my
mitts cut in the early bird i been
waitin moren ten years t find out how
itd feel t see chicago charlie count
out my winnins on that hundred-t-one
shot i reckon thats worth a few
hours in jail eh boss

  mr clackworthys slight shudder
seemed to dispute this opinion

  new railroad cars and safes to foil bandits

cpecial safes and railroad cars may be used soon to protect the united states
mails from robbers each of the new cars which already have been tried out
holds several huge square steel safes it is necessary to move two levers in order
to open the safes while the steel boxes are in the railroad car one of their levers
cannot be moved as the arrangement of the safes in the car prevents any manipu-
lation of these levers

in the directors room

h

he star reporter of the eve-
ning standard waldron
shumway covered up his
typewriter and glanced at the
clock above the city desk the hands
pointed to three fifty-five

  pierce the city editor was sitting
easily back in his swivel chair smoking
a cigar and glancing through the early
editions of the other afternoon papers
his assistant was reading a magazine
fanny fletcher feature writer was
chatting lazily with menns the music
critic about last nights opera

  the financial edition had gone to
press and the dynamic tension was
over for the moment the local room
was languorously peaceful resting
from the days hard grind shumway
pushing his typewriter aside rose from
his desk thinking of the date he had
for to-night with katharine hoyt he
and katharine were going to a new
musical show and afterward to supper

  whistling blithely he started toward
his locker for his hat and overcoat and
then all at once he became aware of
a sudden commotion at the city desk
turning he saw pierce talking excit-
edly at the telephone while barker his
assistant had tossed aside his magazine
and was hurrying to the private office
of carmody the managing editor the
air tingled with electric tension

  these things at once told shumway
that a big story was breaking he
was hastening to the city desk even be-
fore pierce called sharply shum-
way 

  whats happened pierce

  plenty henry w reeves presi-
dent of the second national bank has
just been murdered

  where

  at the bank hurry

  shumway sped back to the locker
seized his hat and overcoat and rushed
for the street as he dashed from the
local room struggling into his overcoat
while he ran his eye chanced to en-
counter the clock on the wall the
hands pointed to three fifty-nine

  walking rapidly toward the second
national bank building which was
only four blocks away shumway vis-
ualized the scene that he supposed
awaited him there the startled officials
the frightened clerks the confusion and
excitement the curious crowd outside
the bank the ambulance and police-
men but for what he really found he
was totally unprepared

  since it was after banking hours the
massive front doors were closed and
bolted but when he entered the bank
through the employees private en-
trance where he was admitted on the
presentation of his reporters card he
was surprised to see that there were no
visible signs of anything unusual

  the clerks and tellers were in their
cages clearly intent upon their routine
duties several of the executives were
at their desks similarly oblivious to all
except the work before them a
sleepy-looking janitor was methodically
mopping the marble-tiled floor except
for the rhythmic swish of his mop
scarcely a sound disturbed the stillness

  there was nothing here to indicate
that a murder had been committed or


that anything out of the ordinary had
happened shumway irresolute and
puzzled was wondering if somebody
had hoaxed his city editor when he
heard his name called turning to look
he saw nat sloan of the evening
times

  who killed him asked sloan
breathing like a spent runner

  who killed who

  reeves hes dead isnt he mur-
dered

  dont know yet i havent seen
him

  somebody phoned my office sloan
declared still breathing hard said
old reeves had been croaked wasnt
more than ten minutes ago what
dyou know about that

  i know this much said shumway
nodding toward the marble steps that
led to the bank floor the same mes-
sage has been telephoned to every news-
paper office in town

  up the steps swarmed a phalanx of
eager newspapermen representing the
evening star the evening dispatch
the morning post and the morning
sun

  it speedily developed that all had re-
ceived the same communication which
had brought sloan and shumway to the
bank after a hasty consultation all
agreed that they were victims of a prac-
tical joker

  still said shumway bending his
gaze on a desk in the far corner weve
got to make sure of that thats
reeves desk over there near the win-
dow and reeves is not there weve
got to find reeves

  youll find him at his club said
the sun reporter drinking his favorite
hooch i know reeves

  in find him then said sloan and
bring him here so i can see him

  i pass the buck to shumway he
knows him even better than i
accepted with pleasure shumway
said and leaving his colleagues he

strode the length of the big rotunda
and stopped before a mahogany desk
behind a mahogany railing where sat
a slender elderly gentleman wearing
gold-rimmed spectacles shumway rec-
ognized this official as g n simpson
from whom he had often received
financial news for his paper

  excuse me mr simpson he said
pleasantly i wonder if i may see mr
reeves for a moment

  mr simpson glanced briefly up from
the work before him youll find him
at that desk in the corner he said
carefully signing a letter

  shumway made an elaborate pretense
of inspecting the corner desk but
theres nobody at that desk mr simp-
son

  mr simpson put down his pen with
grave deliberation and turned and
looked over his shoulder

  strange he murmured patently
surprised he was there a few min-
utes ago hes probably in the direc-
tors room who wants to see him 

  shumway of the evening stand-
ard

  ill tell him youre here said the
elderly simpson and he rose from his
desk and moved toward a mahogany
door some thirty feet away

  shumway following him narrowly
with his eyes saw him casually open
the door as if to cross the threshold
then violently start and stagger back-
ward as though struck in the face by
an invisible hand then he swiftly en-
tered the room and closed the door be-
hind him

 in another moment shumway had
vaulted the mahogany railing and was
running toward the dosed door he
flung the door open every sense quiv-
eringly alert and what he beheld in the
directors room confirmed his wild sus-
picion sprawling unnaturally across
the thick rug beside an overturned
chair lay the body of henry reeves
president of the bank a glance -uf-


detective story magazine

ficed to show that he was dead and
the crimson-stained rug the deep gash
in his neck showed that death had come
in a violent manner

chapter ii

apple seeds

it was characteristic of shumway that
his first thought was for his paper
there was a telephone a few feet away
he crossed to it swiftly and called his
office

  the first thing to do he said to
pierce after describing the scene at the
bank is to learn who phoned you
about this murder maybe you already
know who it was eh

  no i dont said pierce over the
wire it was a mans voice and he
merely said this is z calling ive
just killed reeves of the second na-
tional then he hung up i tried to
reestablish the connection but couldnt
make it were tracing the call now
or trying to

  good weve got to find him in-
sisted shumway theres a real mys-
tery here and this unknown z is prob-
ably the only person who can clear it
up he phoned you about three fifty-
seven or between three fifty-five and
three fifty-nine i remember looking at
the clock

  other papers there asked pierce
all of them he phoned them too
theyre in the directors room now
said shumway rising from the desk
with the receiver to his ear so id
better choke off call you back in a
few minutes he snapped the re-
ceiver on its hook and hurried back to
the long paneled room where lay the
body of the murdered banker

  the room was rapidly filling with ex-
cited persons two of the evening
newspaper reporters were quarreling
over a telephone at another telephone
stood simpson calling the police in an
excited tone of voice

  several of the other bank officials at-
tracted by the unwonted commotion
stood gaping in speechless horror at
reeves dead body as if unable to be-
lieve their eyes a number of minor
employees similarly drawn to the
chamber of death clogged the doorway
whispering excitedly to one another
craning their necks to see what had
happened the bank peacefully doz-
ing a few minutes ago was now buzz-
ing with alarm

  it was also characteristic of shum-
way that when people around him be-
came excited he grew calm now in
the midst of all this frantic agitation
he was cool master of his thoughts and
his mind was working with the pre-
cision of a piece of perfect mechanism

  heedless of the feverish babble in the
room he concentrated all his faculties
on one thing alone who killed reeves 

  rapidly he marshaled all the known
facts adding to them as he inspected
the room and questioned the bank of-
ficials these facts when brought to-
gether were arrayed in his mind as fol-
lows  first reeves had entered the di-
rectors room unknown to his asso-
ciates between three and four oclock
this afternoon second also unknown
to his associates or to any other per-
son in the bank he had met a violent
death there third so far as was known
he had no enemies and no cause to take
his own life fourth his assailant as-
suming it was murder and not suicide
had gained access to the directors room
by a private passageway which led to a
corridor on the second floor of the bank
building fifth since the body was still
warm when found reeves had died
only a few minutes before

  as shumway mentally noted his fifth
fact it came to him that the banker
undoubtedly was still alive when the
mysterious z had telephoned to the
standard this of course brought
him back to the important question of
who this anonymous person was and


that bred other baffling- questions which
shumway quickly classified thus first
assuming the unknown z had murdered
reeves what was his motive second
if he had committed the murder why
had he telephoned the newspapers
about it third if he hadnt com-
mitted the murder how had lie known
of it before the banker was dead

  these and other puzzling questions
hinged clearly enough on the apprehen-
sion of z and shumway having made
a hasty inspection of the room and
questioned those who might shed light
on the mystery started briskly back to
the telephone intending to call pierce
again as he shoved his way through
the frightened crowd which now filled
the big room he chanced to pass near
the body of the dead bank president
he paused for a moment to gaze down
at it his brows knitted in perplexity

  reeves in falling had evidently
struck one of the heavy chairs and up-
set it his left hand rested on a rung
of the chair and his right arm was
flung out horizontally from his body
he lay with his head thrown back and
it was apparent that a severed jugular
vein had sealed his fate

 suddenly shumway stooped and
picked from the rug beside the body
three tiny brown objects which he per-
ceived to be apple seeds he quietly
inclosed these in his palm and then he
saw something that seemed to have
a deeper significance something that
piqued his interest sharply the out-
stretched right hand of the dead man
clutched a ragged sheet of red paper

  shumway would have given much to
have possessed that bit of red paper
and for a moment he rashly thought of
taking it but he knew the danger of
doing that before the coroners arrival
knew he was courting trouble in con-
cealing even the apple seeds besides
simpson and his fellow officials had re-
covered from their shock and were now-
clearing the room

  ejected with the rest of the crowd
shumway put the apple seeds in a vest
pocket then stepped to a telephone and
called his office

  weve traced the call tierce jubi-
lantly told him it came from the
drug store two doors north of the bank
ive got two men on the way there
ill be there first said shumway
and bolted for the street

  entering the crowded drug store he
wedged his way to the cashiers cage
and said to the proud young woman
there about five minutes to four this
afternoon you sold a telephone slug or
maybe five or six to a man who was
eating an apple do you remember
what that man looked like

 the young woman surveyed him
haughtily whats eatin you she
inquired with superb disdain we got-
ten public booths in this store and i
sell a thousand slugs a day beat it
shumway didnt beat it instead he
handed her a ten-dollar bill

  think it over he told her ear-
nestly and try to remember ill re-
turn in a minute

  he crossed to the first telephone
booth saw it was occupied by a woman
in furs and tried the next one search-
ing the floor he found nothing more im-
portant that a cigar stump and a burnt
match he scanned the floor of the third
booth likewise unsuccessfully the
fourth was occupied and he moved on

  when he opened the door of the sev-
enth booth and looked closely at the
floor he uttered a low cry of triumph
and plucked from a corner a fresh
apple core recently thrown there he
entered the booth closed the door
which automatically lighted the lamp
overhead and with his thumb nail pried
a seed from the apple core and com-
pared it with those in his vest pocket

  they matched as perfectly as the
buttons on his coat pocketing his pos-
sessions he sought the proprietor of the
store and quietly told him what had

happened his fellow workers from
the standard came in at this juncture
and shumway knowing the coroner
had probably arrived by now left them
in charge of the drug-store angle and
hurried back to the bank

  when he entered the directors room
he found the coroner whom he knew
intimately examining the body of the
slain bank president two detective
sergeants whom he also knew were in-
specting the room and the doors were
guarded by two patrolmen

  but shumways eyes went first of all
to the right hand of the dead man it
was empty there was a bit of red
paper in his right hand tom he said
casually to the coroner you got it i
suppose

  the coroner kneeling beside the
body looked up over his shoulder
oh hello shumway yes i found
the paper- its on the table there i
cant make anything of it

  shumways eyes darting instantly to
the table beheld the ragged piece of
paper and involuntarily he gasped with
amazement surely this was carrying
the thing too far zigzagging crazily
across the red surface in heavy black
lines was the crude gigantic letter z

under tiie microscope

fycring his several years experi-
ence in metropolitan newspaper
work shumway had encountered many
peculiar criminals but here was one
quite new to him

  here was one who walked boldly
into a bank stabbed the president to
death left his calling card in his vic-
tims hand scattered other evidence
about then calmly walked out and told
the newspapers all about it and got
away the brazenness of the thing to
say the least was disconcerting

  examining the sheet of scarlet paper
under a reading glass which he found

in the room shumway discerned it was
of strong linen texture that it con-
tained two faint finger prints and that
the letter z was roughly drawn with a
soft black crayon

 and now the coroner emptying
reeves pockets drew forth a second
sheet of like description this too
was scrutinized by shumway who un-
perceived pinched off a comer that
bore a thumb print and quietly con-
cealed it in his hand

  tantalized by the multiplicity of
clews he waited till the coroners inves-
tigation was finished and discovering
nothing further of note he then re-
turned to the drug store

  the cashier had been searching her
memory and she now vaguely de-
scribed to him a number of men to
whom she had sold telephone slugs to-
day the proprietor supplied a de-
scription of others whom he had seen
in the store that afternoon and who so
he thought had acted suspiciously

  shumway wrote down the salient
points though he felt it was futile like
describing small objects lost in the sea

  the musical show which he had
eagerly anticipated seeing that night
was to him and katharine a failure in
the circumstances it could not have
been otherwise

  katharines father j d hoyt was
president of the state bank of oakdale
and a warm friend of the murdered
reeves the dinner-table talk in her
home that evening centering almost ex-
clusively on the tragedy at the second
national had not been conducive to
joyousness

  her mood therefore was dismal
and shumway unconsciously con-
tributed thereto for the first time
since she had known him he was pre-
occupied in her presence and inatten-
tive to her he was similarly heedless
of the bright performance although
he stared steadily at the stage his mind




took no cognizance of what happened
there he was in fact completely
buried in his thoughts and oblivious to
everything around him

  shumways brain wtas working hard
on a plan to trap the mysterious z it
was only a nebulous plan as yet

but-- suddenly he rose and with

a hasty apology went to the nearest
telephone booth and called the city
editor of the morning sun

  hello mclaughlin    shum-
way talking want to ask a small
favor just for my own information
would you mind telling me exactly what
this anonymous bird known as z said
to you over the phone this afternoon 
as nearly as i can remember mc-
laughlin answered he said this is
z speaking ive just killed reeves of
the second national 

  you sure he said nothing else
nothing else that i recall oh wait
a second he did say something else at
that something nutty as i remem-
ber something about apple seeds i
think

  shumway suppressed his swift throb
of elation and asked in a puzzled tone
did you say apple seeds old man

 apple seeds is what i said
whatd he say about apple seeds
cant remember his words exactly
but it was something about looking for
apple seeds he was clearly off his
nut

  further interrogation failing to elicit
anything more definite shumway called
the morning post randall night city
editor possessed a better memory

  i recall his words perfectly said
randall  this is z calling he said
to me ive just killed reeves of the
second national look for the apple
seeds what he meant by that last
crack heaven only knows have you
any idea what he was driving at
shumway answered evasively and
then phoned pierce at his home

  why yes said pierce now that

you remind me of it he did say some-
thing about apple seeds but i attached
no particular importance to it the fact
is that when he mentioned killing
reeves i cut in with a question and
his chatter about apple seeds was lost
what do you see in it shumway 
whats on your mind

  i cant tell you now said shumway
and returned to his seat in the theater
treading on air

  his plan was not so nebulous now
in fact it was shaping itself beautifully
in his mind and he wras jubilant

  when he sat down beside katharine
however he saw that no such joy was
hers the curtain was down and the
lights were up and she looked at him
with disapproval where on earth
have you been she asked a touch of
coolness in her voice you missed the
best part of the first act

i dont care he answered lightly
id far rather sit and talk with you
if youll pardon my saying so i
think its high time youve pointedly
ignored me the entire evening

  ill make up for it now he prom-
ised and reassuringly patted her hand
from now on i shall devote myself to
you exclusively

  straightway he excluded all thought
of the mystery which hitherto had oc-
cupied his mind and paid homage to
her and later when they sat vis-a-
vis at a charming after-theater supper
in a sparkling restaurant he smiled into
her starry eyes across the pink-shaded
lamplit table and wove a dream about
her loveliness some day he fondly
whispered to himself she would face
him thus across the breakfast table

  when at last he reached home how-
ever he put all such thoughts aside
it was nearly two oclock when he let
himself into his room for the suburban
town of oakdale was a good twelve
miles from his lodgings but he did not
immediately prepare for bed

  instead he closed and locked the


detective story magazine

door lowered the window shades and
attached a high-powered electric bulb
to the reading lamp on his table he
then brought forth the bit of red paper
and the apple core and seeds and for
upward of an hour he studied them
with a powerful microscope of par-
ticular interest to him were the marks
of the teeth in the apple core and the
thumb print on the paper

  when he turned out the light and got
into bed he was well satisfied with his
progress his plan to capture z seemed
perfect

chapter iv

a message from z

-e was up before seven oclock and
thirty minutes later he occupied a
stool in a lunch room round the corner
simultaneously breakfasting and read-
ing the morning newspapers

  the reeves story of course had
been played up heavily in both morn-
ing papers and was liberally embel-
lished with pictures of the slain banker
and members of his family photo-
graphs of the bank more photographs
of the coroner and detectives search-
ing for clews and a diagram of the
directors room with a maltese cross
indicating the spot where the body was
found a perusal of the text however
failed to disclose anything beyond what
shumway already knew

  at least one important thing and this
only contributed to the mystery had
been definitely established robbery
was not the motive several hundred
dollars in currency had been found on
the dead mans body and his costly gold
watch a pearl scarfpin and other ob-
jects of considerable value were found
intact

  but shumway had already ascer-
tained that the unknown murderer had
stolen nothing and last night while
studying the several peculiar phases of
the crime he had he believed discov-
ered the thing that actuated it upon

this thing he had decided to base his
procedure to-day

  after breakfast he telephoned his of-
fice and said to pierce

  im working on the reeves story
ive an idea of my own id like to fol-
low up if i can have two or three hours
to do as i please it may mean a big
scoop for us or it may mean nothing
i cant tell yet shall i go ahead 
sure said the city editor but
what is this idea shumway

  ill tell you as soon as i get to the
office and i ought to be there before
eleven

  all right hop to it said pierce and
hung up the receiver

  shumway then went to a large dental
supply house and asked to see the pro-
prietor

  im from the standardhe said to
this gentleman and i want a good fea-
ture story on the newest discoveries in
dentistry i should particularly like to
get the latest dope on bridgework false
teeth and dental surgery can you fix
me up

  i can and will said the beaming
proprietor clearly pleased by the pros-
pect of free publicity we have a
wonderful plant here and ill be glad
to show you through it

  id rather not put you to so much
trouble protested shumway but i
should like to see the place where you
make false teeth and i wish you would
explain how they are fitted to peoples
mouths

  delighted we have a wonderful
laboratory biggest in the city step
this way please

  an hour had passed before shum-
way emerged to the street again but
he felt that the hour had been well
spent he next called upon a noted
finger-print expert and interviewed him
for thirty minutes ostensibly for the
purpose of writing a story concerning
the various characteristics of thumb
prints
z



  from there he went to a department
store and bought a soft black crayon
then he visited in turn three stationers
and though he was unable to find
exactly what he wanted a bright red
paper of stout linen texture he found
something that he thought might an-
swer his purpose a cherry-colored
wrapping paper he bought two
pounds then started for his office

  on his way there he stopped at a
fruit store and carefully selected and
bought four apples of different varie-
ties at a second store he found two
more varieties unobtainable at the first
place and he bought one of each kind

  it was five minutes of eleven when
he entered the local room of the
standard and the incessant clatter of
many typewriters the scurrying copy
boys the industrious reporters the nerv-
ous tension in the air all were familiar
signs to him of the home-edition dead-
line placing his purchases in his
locker he walked toward the city desk
always the center of feverish activity
when an edition was going to press

  pierce was conferring with the
make-up editor and for the moment his
desk was left in charge of barker his
assistant barker was handling a
steady stream of copy which flowed
from the machines of three rewrite men
and five reporters and trying to answer
two telephones at once he nodded
toward the third phone as shumway
stopped beside the desk

  answer that will you shumway
shumway picked up the telephone
and placed the receiver to his ear
hello said he

  this is z calling said a deep mas-
culine voice ive just killed ashfield
of the western trust look for the
apple seeds

  shumways strong fingers spasmodi-
cally gripped the telephone instrument
and for a breathless instant he listened
tensely the receiver glued to his ear
every sense quiveringly alive then as

no further sound came he said clearly
and distinctly in a tone of stern au-
thority i dont believe a word you
say i think youre lying to us

  but it was no use the telephone
connection had been broken

  instantly for he realized the value of
every second he got the standard
switchboard operator on the wire
trace that call he said sharply
the last one you got for the city desk
drop everything else and trace it its
of the utmost importance then he
whirled round to pierce who was still
talking with the make-up man quite
unaware of what had happened l
d ashfield president of the western
trust has just been murdered he
said heedless of the quick excitement
that seized all within sound of his voice
and the babble of questions that were
shot at him he went on better call
up every public telephone booth within
two blocks of the bank id put at least
five men on it pierce then call up
the bank and ask for harris first vice
president weve got to work fast

every second is precious ive-

  is this another z killing pierce
demanded

  yes just got his message over the
phone miss mandel is tracing the call
mustnt lose a moment im off for the
bank be there in five minutes

  he was already hurrying toward the
door not waiting to get his overcoat
he sped down the stairs and out into
the street a taxicab stood at the curb
western trust and make it snappy
he said to the chauffeur as he sprang
into the vehicle

chapter v

carmody consents

the circumstances surrounding the
mysterious slaying of president
ashfield of the western trust com-
pany were as shumway quickly dis-
cerned almost identical with those


detective story magazine

that attended the murder of president
reeves of the second national bank

  that the same person had committed
both crimes there could be no doubt
ashfield had been stabbed to death in
his private office not more than twenty
minutes ago or shortly before eleven
oclock by an unknown man who had
entered and left the room without at-
tracting attention the slayer had then
telephoned the city editors of all the
newspapers the same weird message
that had startled them yesterday

  ashfields body had been found by
an office boy john simmons only a
few minutes before the newspaper men
arrived when shumway hastened
into the bank he found this frightened
lad surrounded by a group of men who
were excitedly plying him with ques-
tions

  listening unobtrusively shumway
learned that the boy had admitted the
murderer to the bankers private office
and a little later had seen him depart
but could give no adequate description
of him

  he was tall and skinny said the
trembling youth in answer to a ques-
tion and i guess thats all i can re-
member about him cept that he wore a
long overcoat

  was he dark or light-haired
somebody asked

  i guess he was dark no he was
light im not sure which he wasnt
in mr ashfields office moren two or
three minutes declared the boy defen-
sively and i dont see how he could
a done much in just that litle time
you saw him come out

  yes sir he come out and closed
the door and walked away just like
nothin had happened

  which way did he go

  i didnt notice where he went i
wasnt payin much attention i guess
he went out in the street i dont
know

  what happened next

  well pretty soon miss nichols give
me some letters for mr ashfield to
sign and i went to his office and opened
the door and i saw him sittin there at
the desk all slumped over and his face
was smeared with crimson stains the
boy overcome by the memory of the
horror he had seen was unable to
continue

  how did you happen to let this man
in one of his questioners asked
what did he say to you

  well he said he wanted to see mr
ashfield and when i asked him for his
card he said never mind the card
just tell im mr zander wants to see
im on some very important business
well i told mr ashfield that and he
said to tell the gentleman to come in
well the man went in and he wasnt in
there moren two or three minutes be-
fore he come out again 

  shumway hurried on to ashfields
office shoved his way through the
crowd of people standing about the
doorway and in one swift glance took
in the scene within the room the dead
banker sat in a deep swivel chair before
his desk his face buried in his arms
resting upon the plate-glass top

  his back was toward the door and
shumway divined that the murderer
had slipped noiselessly up behind him
cut his throat then stepped from the
room as casually as he had entered
ashfield had pitched forward on his
face and now lay as he had fallen

  entering the room shumways eyes
darted to the dead mans right hand
clenched beside his head and yes
there it was a bit of paper as red
as the stains on the desk protruded
from his fingers zs calling card

  kneeling he searched the rug around
the chair and when he rose he held in
his palm three apple seeds an irate
bank official confronted him seized
him and pointed angrily to the door

  get out youve no business in
here clear out


  of course i will said shumway
if itll ease your mind i dont blame
you a bit for losing your head

  outside the door he was besieged by
a half dozen of his colleagues who had
been denied admittance to the room
all talking at once they plied him with
eager questions whatd you find
shumway is he dead who killed
him iiow was he killed whatd
you see in there see anything of any

apple seeds  the boss said-

  shumway genial though noncommit-
tal good-naturedly shook them off and
hurried to the public telephone booth
near the main entrance to the bank and
called his office

  weve traced the call pierce told
him it came from the public booth in
the western trust building

  im telephoning in that booth now
said shumway

 good gosh search it man
maybe hes left a clew look around
he may still be in the bank or in the
neighborhood

  shumway slowly replaced the re-
ceiver on the hook his brows knitted in
deep thought inspected the narrow
shelf in the booth and the telephone di-
rectory lying there then searched the
floor finding nothing he stepped
from the booth and swept his gaze
keenly around the bank it was buzz-
ing with noon-day customers none of
whom suspected anything amiss

  a tall skinny man in a long over-
coat so the boy had said

  he glanced toward the boy saw his
questioners had been augmented by the
newspaper men and two plain-clothes
detectives and sauntered to the rear of
the bank and back scrutinizing all
around him he then walked outside
and as far as the corner eying every
person who appeared to be loitering in
the neighborhood

  the quest was hopeless as he feared
it would be yet at least he had obeyed
pierces instructions

  the coroner had arrived when he re-
turned to the bank and he learned that
ashlields death was caused by a sev-
ered jugular vein that nothing had
been stolen from him or from his office
and that the sheet of red paper found
in his hand bore a crude black letter z

  he now sought the boy simmons
took him aside and contrived to have a
few minutes private talk with him
this man who entered mr ashfields
office he said to the lad was eating
an apple when you saw him wasnt
he

  well if i didnt forget all about
that exclaimed the boy howd you
know he was eatin an apple

  while he was eating the apple
pursued shumway or while he was
talking did you notice his mouth 
well yes i guess so

  then you saw his teeth think
hard now what sort of teeth did he
have 

  with a visible effort the boy prodded
his memory suddenly his face bright-
ened i remember now he had one
of his front teeth gone i think it was
this one here he indicated with his
finger the position of the missing tooth

  did he look you in the eye while lie
was talking to you or how did he
act 

  i guess i dont remember about that
i looked up and saw him standin there
eatin an apple and when he said he
wanted to see mr ashficld and i asked
him for his card he sorta grinned and
i saw one of his teeth was gone thats
about all i remember about im

  all right johnny heres a halt
dollar for you 

  further inquiry disclosed thar no
other person had observed the man ex-
cept mr ashfields secretary miss
nichols and she busily typing at her
desk had given him only a fleeting
glance as he entered her employers of-
fice she corroborated johnnys state-
ment that he was tall and thin and wore


detective story magazine

a long ovcrcoat but could recall noth-
ing else that might help to identify him

  after cleaning up on the story and
ascertaining that it corresponded in all
its salient details with the murder com-
mitted yesterday shumway started
back to his office

  this second peculiar murder tread-
ing hard on the heels of the first did
not puzzle him or complicate the mys-
tery but rather substantiated the theory
that he had already formed nor was
he persuaded to alter the plan carefully
conceived last evening indeed he was
now more than ever firmly convinced
that this plan offered the only quick
way of trapping the murderer

  late that afternoon when the final
edition had gone to press he outlined
the plan to pierce and to michael car-
mody the managing editor in the lat-
ters office when he had finished car-
mody shook his head dubiously it
sounds too fantistic to me shumway
what do you think of it pierce

  ill say this for shumway replied
the city editor hes solved more crime
mysteries and caught more crooks than
any other man on my staff if not more
than all the rest combined this pres-
ent scheme of his i admit seems pretty
extravagant but i know shumway
im willing to take a chance on it

  very well then said carmody
turning back to shumway go ahead
with your plan and draw on the paper
for whatever money you need youll
be needing some cash right away i take
it so ill give you an order on the cash-
ier now

  thanks said shumway briefly i
cant guarantee of course that ill
catch this bird within a certain length
of time or even that ill catch him at
all but unless im sadly mistaken ill
be able to hand him over to the police
inside of forty-eight hours

  theres one thing sure he earnestly
added if hes not caught pretty soon
hell commit more murders the two

weve already had are i am sure only
the forerunner of others this man
has just begun to kill

chapter vi

a shack on steel street

mow that he had authority to go
ahead shumway immediately set
and baited the trap which carmody
justifiably perhaps had characterized as
too bizarre

  his first act upon leaving the manag-
ing editors office was to write a post-
script story to be run on the first page
of all editions of the next days stand-
ard concerning a mythical professor
zipf self-styled banking expert

 written in straight newspaper
style with no undue embellishment
the story stated that professor zipf
reduced to poverty by the collapse of a
bank in which he had deposited his
lifes savings now lived in a wretched
hovel here he was engaged in writing
a book that would expose the evils of
the banking system shumway wrote

  professor zipf was found by a standard
reporter in a poor neighborhood living alone
in a dilapidated shanty meagerly furnished
and heated only by a rusty oil stove he sat
at a crude pine table busily writing when
the reporter found him

  at first he was unwilling to talk but
eventually he consented to an interview when
it was pointed out to him that this might aid
him in finding a publisher for his book
among other things he said that his diet con-
sisted chiefly of apples which he declared to
be the most healthful of foods a large
bowl of the fruit was on the table beside his
writing pad and he ate one of these while
speaking with the reporter from the
standard

  then followed a lengthy interview in
which professor zipf described how
his life had been ruined by an inex-
cusable bank failure how his home
had been destroyed and how his book
when published would shake our ne-
farious banking system to its rotten
foundation

shumway uncommonly painstaking


in writing the story carefully omitted
one salient point the exact where-
abouts of professor zipf beyond the
vague information that he lived in a
poor neighborhood there was no clew
to his street address

  he gave the copy to carmody for ap-
proval then wrapped up the things he
had bought that morning and called at
the office of an old and trusted friend
one robert cooper a salesman for the
real estate firm of d l rothschild 
co

  bobby old man im in the market
for a house

  youre out of luck said bobby

  im in the market said shumway
unperturbed for the meanest ugliest
dirtiest tumble-down shack in town and
its got to be in a street of the same de-
scription the more slovenly the street
the better

  in these days said bobby cooper
with houses scarce as snowballs in
june thats the only sort of place you
can find but whats the joke

  shumway convinced hiii he wasnt
joking and young cooper inspected his
card index and plucked forth a card and
studied it

 hows this sound he asked
heres a three-room cottage on steel
street thats a tenement district you
know and theres no plumbing no elec-
tricity no gas no heat the house
which has been unoccupied for several
years is in a state of general disre-
pair

  have you got a sign on it shum-
way interrupted

  no and wed hardly care to put one
on we dont want the name of our
firm associated with such a hut as a
matter of fact were not offering it
either for sale or rent the old man
owns the property as well as several
adjoining lots and hes planning to
erect a modern structure flats and
stores as soon as building gets back to
normal

  ill rent the house said shumway
at your own figure if youll nail a
for rent sign on it

  i suppose i could manage that
how long will you want the house old
man 

  not more than a week probably
less but ill pay you a months rent in
advance on one other condition
within twenty-four hours perhaps to-
morrow morning a number of men will
be asking you for the name of the per-
son who rented this house to all of
them you are to say that the house
has not been rented will not be rented
and is soon to be torn down tell em
nobody is living there that your sign
was placed on the house by mistake
i suppose i could manage that too
if you want to see the shack old man

i can-

  not now bobby ill take your
word that its what i want and ill
move in sometime to-morrow mean-
while get that sign up better do the
job yourself i wish youd do it to-
night with as little fuss as possible for
i dont want the neighbors to see you
if you drive out in your car park it
several blocks from the house and go
the rest of the way afoot

  it shall be done bobby promised
and now not that i care a cent of
course would you mind explaining all
this dark deep mystery

  i cant tell you just yet bobby
youll pardon me wont you at the
present moment only two persons be-
sides myself know why im doing this
in less than forty-eight hours if all
goes well it will be known by many
times two millions

chapter vii

setting the stage

i eaving the real estate office with
a key to the cottage in his pocket
shumway went to a secondhand furni-
ture store in a crowded neighborhood


detective story magazine

and bought three broken chairs a cheap
kitchen table an old glass jar griev-
ously cracked and chipped a portable
bookcase of like description three blan-
kets and a mattress sundry cooking
utensils a kerosene lamp and a stove

  lie paid the proprietor saying he
would return for the goods in an hour
then boarded a street car rode to an-
other part of the city and alighted near
a garage that made a specialty of rent-
ing automobiles

 im showing some out-of-town
friends around to-night he said to the
owner with whom he was slightly ac-
quainted and i want a closed car for
about four hours ill drive it myself

  ten minutes later in an ancient
limousine he was traveling back in the
direction from which he had come he
stopped en route at an old book store
and from the dusty shelves selected
two dozen odd books on banks and
banking these he bought and placed
in the car

  further on he passed a lighted pawn-
shop and two blocks away he stopped
the car removed his hat and overcoat
and walked back to the shop and ad-
dressed himself to a phlegmatic young
man behind a show case filled with re-
volvers coupla guys stuck me up
down the street got my hat and coat
all i managed to save was a five-dollar
bill id like to get home without freez-
ing can you fix me up

  he left the pawnshop wearing a
shabby overcoat that reached well be-
low his knees and a discarded felt hat
both of which gave him a quite dis-
reputable appearance he made two
more purchases before reaching the
secondhand furniture store at a cor-
ner grocery he bought a half dozen old
gunny bags and at a hardware store a
package of carpet tacks

  it was nearly ten oclock that night
with a north wind blowing freezingly
when he steered the aged limousine
heavily freighted with secondhand chat-

tels into the alley back of no 
steel street having darkened his
lamps he proceeded slowly cautiously
with the least possible amount of noise
eyes and ears keenly aiert

  luckily the cold had frigidly sealed
the denizens of this teeming district
within their miserable homes and his
arrival in their squalid midst was un-
observed

  wearing the tattered hat and overcoat
he entered the tumble-down cottage and
so far as he could determine in the
darkness for he dared not strike a
match it was all that cooper had
claimed the rotting floor gave sog-
gily beneath his feet the wind whistled
through the broken windows and the
rooms seemed moldy with decay

  without delay he lugged the goods
from the automobile across the small
back yard littered with all manner of
refuse and placed them in the shanty
then be rubbed the gunny sacks in the
dust on the floor and tacked them over
the windows

  he now locked the door returned
to his car and drove silently away as
he emerged from the dark alley his
lamps still unlit he paused to look back
upon his surrounding palely illumined
by the moon he was reasonably sure
that no eye had seen him arrive or de-
part

  hard upon midnight shumway en-
tered his own rooms carrying the dis-
reputable hat and overcoat in a roll be-
neath his arm bolting the hall door
behind him he lowered the shades
switched on the lights and settled down
to the remainder of his nights work
he was glad for the warmth and the
cheer which were doubly welcome after
the squalor of the cottage that he had
just left

  with a pot of coffee fragrantly
steaming on an alcohol stove beside
him he bisected the apples which he
had bought that morning and removed
the seeds and compared them beneath


his microscope with those found be-
side the murdered bankers when at
length he had perfectly matched the
seeds he made a notation in his memo-
randum book and turned his attention
to the cherry-colored wrapping paper

  spreading this paper upon the table
he cut it into sheets eight by eleven
inches in size and then with the soft
black crayon which he had bought at
the department store he printed upon
each ruddy sheet a tremendous letter z

chapter viii

another calling card

arising at six next morning he
examined his face in the bathroom
mirror and decided not to shave
ordinarily a punctilious young man
about his personal appearance he now
proceeded to make himself as dis-
reputable-looking as possible

  he donned a pair of moth-eaten
trousers a soiled shirt and collar a
faded necktie an old coat and vest and
shoes worn beyond repair he then
partially concealed his unkempt appear-
ance with his stylish hat and smart
overcoat which he buttoned around his
neck with the coat and hat from the
pawnshop wrapped in newspaper he
started forth

  in the next block he entered a saloon
which ostensibly had become a soft-
drink parlor to strangers this place
was dry but the proprietors friends
could obtain something more stimulat-
ing than malted milk

  the proprietor knew shumway and
shumway departed a little later with a
quart of whisky in the newspaper par-
cel under his arm thus far at least
his plans for this day were proceeding
nicely

  upon entering the office of the
standard however these plans received
an unexpected jolt pierce visibly ex-
cited hurried him into carmodys office
and gave him a long envelope of bright-

red hue addressed in angular hand-
writing to city editor herald

  it came in this mornings mail said
pierce read it

  shumway drew from the envelope a
sheet of red paper which he instantly
recognized as zs calling card on one
side was printed a huge black z on
the other this message was written

  frank w eggleston president of the mer-
chants bank will be killed at one forty-five
p m on the day you receivc this message

  every paper in town pierce went
on got one of those things in the mail
this morning i tried to get you on
the phone at home but they said youd
left what dyou think of it shum-
way

  shumway examining the missive by
the light at the window saw that the z
was the same as those he had seen be-
fore that the superscription was jerk-
ily written with black ink and the mes-
sage with a soft black lead pencil the
handwriting of both being the same
and that the communication was cor-
rectly spelled and punctuated the
postmark revealed that the letter had
been mailed at the main post office at
five oclock yesterday afternoon

  it seems genuine enough he said
handing it back to pierce of course
it may only be the work of a harmless
crank but i think not

  you think then it was written by
the person who killed reeves and ash-
field

  shumway nodded affirmatively its
the same as his other calling cards
same sort of paper and same black
crayon ive no doubt hell try to kill
eggleston to-day just as he says he
will wheres carmody 

  attending a publishers meeting
  gosh at this hour

  its an emergency session called
twenty minutes ago by all the papers
when it became known that all had re-
ceived that message theyre consider-
ing the question of suppressing it this


detective story magazine

things getting mighty serious shum-
way

 right the police-

  the chief of police pierce inter-
rupted got one too so did captain
grimm of the detective bureau and
so did eggleston he apparently over-
looked nobody

  shumway glanced at his watch i
can see this is going to be my busy day
first ive got to hustle out to that shack
i rented the address by the way in
case you happen to need it is ik
steel street

  that reminds me of something
said pierce writing down the address
that will probably interest you the
standard is offering live thousand dol-
lars for the arrest of z

  i can use it quite neatly shumway
said and called back over his shoulder
as he started for the door ill need it
pretty soon to set up housekeeping
within an hour he entered the tum-
ble-down cottage from the rear carrying
the newspaper parcel and a loaded
market basket and locked the door be-
hind him upon the kitchen table in
the front room he placed the contents
of this basket a can of kerosene some
writing materials an earthen pot a
long-pronged fork a paper lamp shade
two jelly glasses a hammer and chisel
and a dozen baldwin apples

  he perforated two of the apples with
his fork placed them in the earthen pot
and upon them poured a pint of
whisky then working carefully with
hammer and chisel he pried loose two
of the rotting boards in the floor con-
cealed the apples and whisky in the
aperture nailed the boards down and
placed the table and chairs over the
spot

  the next forty minutes were devoted
to giving the cottage an appearance of
long habitation the books were ar-
ranged in the secondhand bookcase the
mattress and blankets were spread on
the floor the lamp and stove wrere

  cleaned and filled the writing materials
were spread on the table he also put
the glass jar on the table and filled it
with six of the bright-red apples

  for two hours thereafter with the
kerosene stove lighted he sat at the
table and made copious notes from one
of the books on banking he wore the
hat and coat from the pawnshop his
own coat and hat hanging in the rear
room

  a few minutes before twelve oclock
he heard footsteps outside the house
then a knock on the door he rose
took an apple from the jar and walked
to the window eating it two news-
paper reporters stood outside

  shumway hastily removed the over-
coat and hat hid them beneath the mat-
tress on the floor and wearing his
more presentable apparel greeted them
cordially its no use boys ive been
waiting three hours for professor zipf
and theres nothing doing

  one of the reporters exhibited an
early edition of the standard and in-
dicated the zipf story on the first page

  what about this interview who
wrote that

  a cub named schiller i came here
this morning for a follow-up story
bought some apples for the professor
on the way out and i found nothing
nobody around here ever heard of
professor zipf i called up d l roths-
child  co agents for the house and
they told me it hadnt been rented you
might try your luck with them ask
for robert cooper

  wed better take a look inside first
step right in said shumway and
make yourselves at home i bought
some oil for the professors stove and
helped myself to one of his books but
its been disagreeable waiting for him
and im ready to give it up

the reporters poked through the
rooms kicked at the mattress read the
titles of the books examined the papers
on the table and decided it was useless


to wait any longer for the nutty pro-
fessor

  its a rotten assignment anyway
said one

  shumway heartily agreed and con-
ducted them to a corner drug store and
ordered hot coffee and sandwiches
while his confreres were consuming
this repast he went to the telephone
booth and called his office

  two unknown men pierce told
him telephoned for zipfs address
one said he was a publisher

  im lunching with them now said
shumway one is tom knox of the
stan and the other is william mandel
of the dispatch both charming fel-
lows any further developments
plenty weve learned that every
banker in town got one of those anony-
mous messages this morning and the
bankers association has held a special
meeting and offered a reward of
twenty-five thousand dollars for the ar-
rest of the person who murdered
reeves and ashfield that means
thirty thousand for you my boy if
your plan succeeds

chapter ix

at one-forty six

vihen shumway reached the mer
chants bank about one oclock
that afternoon he perceived a dozen
uniformed policemen in the neighbor-
hood and as many more plain-clothes
men mingling with the crowds in the
street in a casual unobtrusive manner
since the newspaper publishers asso-
ciation at the special conference this
morning had agreed to print nothing
concerning the threat against eggle-
stons life the people streaming to and
from the bank building never suspected
the cause of the policemens presence

the police department angered by
the boldness of the unknown murderer
and stimulated by the big reward had
taken extraordinary measures to cap-
f-ds

ture him every door to the bank was
heavily guarded and every policeman
in the downtown district had been put
on his mettle

  ascending to the bank floor shum-
way discerned a dozen more plain-
clothes guards stationed quietly at
strategic points the bankers asso-
ciation had retained a private detective
agency and the representatives of this
agency were also present

  he found president eggleston in his
private office exchanging witticisms
with the newspaper men the private
detectives with characteristic self-im-
portance had attempted to eject the re-
porters from the bank but eggleston
also characteristically had forbidden
this

  let em stay he said in his bluff
fashion if theres going to be a kill-
ing in my bank i want the press to
know about it but there wont be any
killing he added emphatically and
rising from his great desk he illus-
trated to the reporters with elaborate
detail the utter impossibility of such
a thing

  his office could be entered he
pointed out only through the door lead-
ing to the bank and that door was now
guarded by three armed men and it
would be so guarded all afternoon
the massive plate-glass window facing
the street was securely locked on the
inside and could not be opened from
without

  besides he went on the window was
a sheer forty feet above the sidewalk
and more than ten feet from the win-
dow above there was no tire escape
near the window and a half dozen men
were guarding it both in the street be-
low and the window above

  so you see he finished laughingly
theres no hope for you boys getting
any news here to-day sorry to dis-
appoint you but therell be no killing
not to-day at any rate theres not
one chance in twenty million


detective story magazine

  they went out leaving him alone
with his secretary a dark-haired young
woman who throughout the demon-
stration had sat quietly beside his
desk staring absently at the stenog-
raphic notebook in her lap

  it was quite apparent to shumway
that egglestons jovial bravado was
mostly sham beneath the bankers
blustering manner he detected an un-
dercurrent of fear which seemed sub-
stantiated by the remarkable precau-
tions he had taken

  and after all who could blame him
with the atrocious murder of his fel-
low bankers reeves and ashfield still
fresh in his mind no wonder he was
alarmed

  shumway last to leave the office
glanced back at the door and saw the
bank president sitting at his desk dic-
tating a letter to his secretary

  a huge clock on the wall informed
him it was fifteen minutes past one
shumway strolled through the bank
remarking that the detectives outnum-
bered the customers he walked back
toward egglestons private office
three men stood guard outside the
door and a short distance away stood
two more narrowly eying every person
who approached

  the street outside as shumway
knew was carefully watched and so
were all the adjacent streets the win-
dow of the bankers office was guarded
by at least a dozen men not one
chance in twenty million eggleston
had said and it seemed he was right

  shumway joined the group of news-
paper men who were sitting outside the
door enjoying the expensive cigars
which eggleston had given to them it
was now twenty-five minutes past one

  the minutes sped past or dragged
slowly along according to your mood
while the reporters bantered one an-
other kidded the detectives smoked
the cigars spent the reward money and
watched the big clock on the wall

  at thirty-eight minutes after one
egglestons secretary came from his of-
fice closed the door behind her and
walked to her desk shumway observ-
ing her closely saw her seat herself at
the desk insert a letterhead in her type-
writer and open her notebook he
noticed her fingers were trembling

  for perhaps a minute she studied her
notes a perplexed frown on her browt
then she rose abruptly with a quick
nervous movement and returned to the
office taking the notebook with her

 at one forty-three she again
emerged again closed the door behind
her and crossed to her desk studiously
ignoring the eyes watching her her
face was pale she was palpably
frightened ill at ease

  it was one forty-four one minute
from the fatal hour the reporters had
ceased their chatter and were silently
watching the clock the guards at the
door were exhibiting signs of nervous-
ness one of them placed his hand on
the knob as if minded to open it and
look within but refrained evidently
fearing the act would betray his excita-
tion

  the giant minute hand of the clock
crept slowly inevitably toward the fig-
ure nine the dozen men who were
watching it almost held their breath as
it touched the three-quarter mark and
when it gradually moved on the mer-
est fraction there was an almost audi-
ble sigh of relief the suspense was
over the fateful moment had come
and gone

  the hand was hovering at one forty-
six when egglestons secretary who
had made several ineffectual attempts
to type a letter sprang from her chair
her face pale as death and hurried to
his office ignoring the detectives she
flung the door open and then just as
she was crossing the threshold she ut-
tered a piercing scream and fell un-
conscious to the floor

  shumway who had been watching


her instead of the clock leaped to his
feet and rushed to the room his eyes
darted instantly to eggleston and he
saw why she had fainted eggleston
was dead

chapter x

i told you so

in the midst of the ensuing panic
shumway kept a level head de-
tectives reporters bank employees all
crowded pell-mell into egglestons of-
fice all talking excitedly all asking
questions which nobody answered

  the unconscious young woman was
carried to a divan somebody tele-
phoned for a doctor somebody else
dashed madly downstairs to spread the
alarm a group gathered quickly at
the desk where the dead man sat
there was much confusion

  shumway standing near the door
heard a voice say hes shot through
the head it killed him instantly

  two answers immediately presented
themselves suicide and the dark-
haired secretary the first he promptly
put aside as for the second-but that
too he saw was highly improbable
true the girl might have killed him
but no shot had been heard

  and then suddenly he perceived the
correct solution and such was its ob-
viousness he wondered he hadnt seen
it at once

  without a word he turned and sped
quietly from the bank and hastened
across the street to an old office build-
ing directly opposite on the third
floor of this aged building he found
what he sought a small room recently
vacated facing the street and com-
manding an unobstructed view of eg-
glestons private office

  beside the open window stood a 
caliber rifle mute evidence of the trag-
edy that had just been enacted here
from the litter on the floor he plucked
a half-eaten baldwin apple and nearby
he found a rifle case but of more im-

mediate interest to him was the sheet
of red paper attached to the barrel of
the rifle

  scrawled across this ruby-colored
sheet which bore the fatal letter z in
the angular handwriting he had seen
that morning were four brief words
forming a grim ironical sentence

  i told you so

  hurried inquiry in the adjacent of-
fices and questioning of the devator
starter and operators revealed nothing
of value the people in the next of-
fice said they had heard some sort of
report a few minutes ago but hadnt
paid it much attention supposing it to
be only the slamming of a door no-
body had seen a man of zs descrip-
tion nor had anybody noticed any-
thing unusual

  shumway telephoned the story to his
paper and ran back to the vacant room
looking across the street into eggle-
stons office he saw that the frantic
men therein had discovered the bullet
hole in the plate-glass window and were
excitedly gesticulating his way

  in ten minutes they were swarming
through the building carefully search-
ing every office minutely examining
the death chamber combing the litter
there for clews interrogating all

  the alarm went forth a hue and
cry went up the police dragnet was
spread throughout the downtown
streets and drawn in and thrown
farther out a dozen or more sus-
pects were arrested when all was
done the entire result came merely to
this z had again committed murder
and again he had eluded the law

chapter xt

another red envelope

hthat night shumway sat in his
shanty copying long passages from
the book on banking until well past
twelve oclock

  his lonely vigil was interrupted by


detective story magazine

an amateur sleuth eagerly seeking
fame and fortune and by two news-
paper men one from the morning
post the other from the morning sun
whom he disposed of in somewhat the
same manner that had proved effective
in the case of the afternoon reporters

  about one oclock he wrapped him-
self in the blankets on the floor and
fell asleep he left the oil stove burn-
ing the kerosene lamp lit on the table
and the door to the cabin unlatched
he awoke with a start to find himself
in darkness and the room freezingly
cold the lamp and stove had burned
out he struck a match and looked at
his watch it lacked twenty minutes of
five

  further sleep being impossible he
sprang from his comfortless couch vio-
lently waving his arms to excite
warmth and went to an owl lunch
room for some hot coffee then he
boarded a downtown street car and be-
fore six oclock entered the local room
of the standard barker who was on
the early shift sat at the city desk clip-
ping the morning newspapers he
looked up in surprise hello what
brings you down so early

  couldnt sleep said shumway
has the mail come yet

  not due for an hour but heres
something that will interest you
barker with his shears indicated a
box on the first page of the morning
sun announcing a reward of five thou-
sand dollars offered by that paper for
the arrest of the person or persons who
had slain henry w reeves l d ash-
field and frank w eggleston

  beyond this announcement the morn-
ing papers contained little that was new
or really important notwithstanding
each of them devoted several columns
to the murder mystery which was de-
clared to be the most baffling in the
annals of the city

  the police and detective departments
were engaged in the greatest man hunt

in their history their dragnet now
extended beyond the city into the sub-
urbs and adjacent towns some twenty
suspicious characters had been caught
in this net and were being held by the
police for investigation but the real
murderer who taunted them with his
notes and supplied them with all man-
ner of clews still remained at large

  shumway with his feet propped on a
steam radiator sat reading the papers
and smoking cigarettes until a boy
came in with the morning mail then
he walked to the desk where the boy
was sorting the letters one stood out
from all the rest and riveted his atten-
tion he drew it forth a long red en-
velope addressed in angular handwrit-
ing to city editor herald

  after a momentary hesitation he tore
it open and extracted the sheet of red
paper within on one side of the sheet
was a huge black z on the other side
this message was written

  walter e hubbell president of the mid-
land trust  savings bank will die before
four p m to-day friday and j d hoyt
president of the state bank of oakdale
will die at nine fifteen a m to-morrow
saturday	

chapter xii

katharine calls

it was as if an unseen hand had dealt
shumway a blow in the face he
sank limply into a chair staring with
distended eyes at the bit of red paper
between his trembling fingers

  for the first time the fog of terror
in which all were groping pierced him
personally hitherto he had sought to
penetrate this fog in the detached im-
personal manner of a scientist but j
d hoyt was katharines father

  for the first time too he experienced
a sort of dazed helplessness stunned
by the unexpected blow he seemed
powerless to think or act but only for
a moment swiftly emerging from his
inertia and realizing the need for quick
wyi



action he got carmody and pierce on
the telephone told them of this new
development and then went to his desk
evolving a new twist to his original
plan

  he inserted a sheet of copy paper in
his typewriter wrote a slug and his
name in the upper left-hand corner
spaced three times and then he sat
scowling at the typewriter keys while
the plan shaped itself in his mind sud-
denly he began writing and wrote
steadily without a moments pause
until carmody arrived

  when carmody had read the note
from z shumway disclosed what he
had written ive two special requests
to make he said one is that we run
that story through all editions to-day
and the other is that you give me a let-
ter to john tyson head of the publish-
ing firm of tyson  sons asking him
to lend us a contract blank such as they
sign for successful authors you might
tell him we want to use it in connection
with a literary note on our saturday
book page

  an hour later with the coveted blank
in his pocket shumway telephoned
hoyt at the bank in oakdale yes i
got the death message said hoyt
laughingly but im not taking it seri-
ously

  does katharine know

  no i arrived at the bank only a
minute ago and found it in my mail
youre the first person ive mentioned
it to i shall now turn it over to the
postal authorities and forget about it
whatever you do said shumway
dont tell katharine no use worry-
ing her unnecessarily

  calling at the midland trust  sav-
ings bank he found iiubbell quite dif-
ferently affected

  i received the thing this morning
said the banker patently alarmed and
i dont intend to take any chances ive
already retained two armed guards to
remain with me constantly during the

day and as an added precaution im
carrying this he exhibited a loaded
revolver our fascinating mr z he
said with grim humor will not catch
me napping i promise you that

  shumway returned to his office and
for the next forty minutes was busily
employed with the publishers contract
in a secluded corner of the local room
here he felt secure from interruption
and prying eyes

  meanwhile he learned from carmody
that the chief of police the chief of de-
tectives every police captain and ail the
newspapers had received duplicates of
the terrifying message opened by him
that morning as on the preceding day
the newspaper publishers agreed to sup-
press news of the communication

  the man hunt grew in fury every
den and crooks hang-out every dive
and criminals nest was being ruthlessly-
raided suspects were rounded up by
scores the police stations were
crowded to the utmost and still the
fog remained impenetrable z the arch
murderer could not be found

  shumway was finishing his job on
the publishers contract when a copy
boy brought word of a lady waitin
outside to see you

  it was katharine and her first words
when she beheld him were what on
earth have you been doing to yourself

you look as if- she checked her

tongue and stared at his face his
clothes as who should say youve
been drinking

  so engrossed had he been that he had
forgotten his unshaved face and the
ragged habiliment which he had not re-
moved since yesterday morning now
however instead of feeling embar-
rassed he was conscious of satisfac-
tion with his trampish appearance
such an appearance was still essential
to his plan preoccupied he made a
vague remark in an absent-minded
way about not having time to clean
up


detective story magazine

  well  think its time you were tak-
ing time she said piqued by his ap-
parent lack of interest hut what
really brought me here she went on
opening her reticule is this she
gave him a sheet of red notepapcr he
opened it and read in the angular
scrawl that had become familiar to
him twenty-four hours after you
rcceivc this you will be fatherless

  it came in the mail this morning
after papa left home she told him i
loathe anonymous notes theres some-
thing peculiarly cowardly about them
i suppose i shouldnt worry about it
but do you think it really means any-
thing

  it means nothing whatever he
promptly assured her and tore the note
to pieces just forget that you ever
received it

  very well i shall now do gel
shaved and freshened up and meet me
somewhere for lunch

  tie shook his head not to-dav
  why not

  he declined to give a reason except
to say he was too busy this of
course was worse than no reason at
all

  she chided him for looking like a
vagabond and hinted none too subtly
that he was guilty of insobriety he
thinking of the big task ahead of him
remembering he was actuated largely
by the hope of saving her father made
no effort to conciliate her she con-
strue this as indifference the
thought irked her their words grew
acrimonious all this of course could
end in but one way they quarreled and
parted in anger

      chapter xiii
      shumways visitor

qflumway walked back into the
local room got his overcoat and
hat and started for his shanty reso-
lutely closing or trying to close his

mind to katharine but the thought
of her and their first quarrel lurked in
his mind ready to leap up in an un-
guarded moment and torture him anew

  stopping at a drug store on his way
to the cabin he bought a roll of ab-
sorbent cotton a bottle of wood alco-
hol a cob pipe and a package of cheap
smoking tobacco at a hardware store
he procured an aluminum sauce pan
with a long handle he also purchased
another quart of whisky and two more
gallons of kerosene

  an hour later he sat at the cheap
pine table in the front room of the cot-
tage reading his book on banking the
jar of red apples was on the table and
on the floor beside his chair were the
jelly glasses and a quart bottle of
whisky

  he wore the discolored hat and
threadbare overcoat and these with his
unshaved face soiled collar and frayed
necktie gave him a decidedly unkempt
look the cob pipe between his teeth
completed the picture

  about four oclock he went out and
telephoned his office he was told that
walter hubbell had died twenty min-
utes ago

  poison said pierce succinctly a
new variety of sanitary drinking cup
was sent him in the mail apparently a
sample from a manufacturer hubbell
took it to the water cooler in half an
hour he was dead mis guards were
with him bur they might just as well
have been in china

  deeply troubled shumway returned
to the cottage the early winter dusk
was setting in and he lit the oil lamp
on the table then he placed a wad of
the absorbent cotton in the saucepan
thoroughly saturated it with alcohol
and put the pan on the floor near the
table with the long handle toward him

  he then sat down and resumed his
book it was dull reading and his eyes
were heavy-lidded if only he might
sleep but he forced himself to stay


awake and plowed steadily on several
times he dozed fitfully and each time
awoke with a jerk at last however
tired nature had her way his head
sank slowly forward he slept
soundly

  he was awakened by a hand falling
heavily on his shoulder and he looked
up to find a tall gaunt man towering
above him calmly eating an apple the
stranger unfolded a copy of the stand-
ard and held it beneath the pale yellow
light shed by the lamp whats the
meaning of this he demanded and
pointed a bony forefinger to a first-
page story

  shumway rubbing the sleep from his
eyes leaned forward and made a pre-
tense of reading the story its true
he said every word of it

  the stranger seemed incredulous
prove it he said

  with pleasure said shumway and
took the publishers contract from his
pocket and gave it to him

  deliberately the man drew a pair of
steel-rimmed spectacles from a rusty
case adjusted them to his nose and
his lean jaws working methodically on
the apple carefully read the contract
through it specifically set forth that
tyson  sons had agreed to publish a
book exposing the evils of the modern
banking system written by one pro-
fessor hugo zipf and had advanced
the aforesaid professor zipf five thou-
sand dollars on his royalty account

  clearly impressed the stranger
asked would they care to publish an-
other such book

  perhaps do you know somebody
who has written one

  vouchsafing no answer he crossed to
the shabby bookcase and peered
through his spectacles at the tattered
volumes rubbish he exclaimed
not a book in the lot worth reading
any man who reads such trash cant
write intelligently of banks and bank-
ing ive written a book that will

startle the world ive described how
bankers make three thousand per cent
on every dollar intrusted to them ive
exposed all their crimes- and i can
prove every word

  sit down said shumway genially
and tell me about it but first he
added hospitably placing the bottle of
whisky and jelly glasses on the table
lets have a nip of liquor

  ive never touched liquor in my
life said the man seating himself near
the window i shant start now

  an apple then

  thanks your apples are better
than your books he selected one
from the glass jar split it with his
thumb took a generous bite odd
flavor for a baldwin he remarked
munching thoughtfully

  you like it

  very odd flavor not bad though
he again bit heavily into the fruit

  shumway filled a jelly glass with
whisky this is what gives it the
flavor he said offering the glass
temptingly try it

  the man hesitated chewing his apple
and eying the glass suspiciously
finally he took it in his hand sniffed
the whisky tasted it smacked his lips
sipped it coughed then emptied the
glass at a gulp

  fire he exclaimed coughing and
sputtering

  shumway leaned across the table
looked him steadily in the eye and said
evenly in a confidential tone you
look like a man who can hold his
tongue so im going to tell you a secret
ive done more for our cause than write
a book i believe in direct action
what would you say if i were to tell
you it was i who killed henry reeves

frank eggleston l d ashfield--

the man leaped to his feet his eyes
blazing id say you were a liar i he
declared his lips were curled back
angrily revealing a missing front tooth
ive proof said shumway and

spread on the table his sheets of cherry-
colored paper the zs uppermost

  forgery said the gaunt stranger
and swept the bits of paper to the floor
i say you lie

  shumway filled the cob pipe with to-
bacco and took a match from his
pocket what makes you think i lie

  his infuriated guest was striding vio-
lently to and fro the fiery whisky
coursing hotly through his veins lashed
his fury suddenly he paused at the
table you know you lie he said in
thunderous tones and banged the table
with his fist i am the man who put
those crooks away dont lie to me i
am the man that america is talking
about to-night you are nothing i
-he drew himself up proudly-i am
the celebrated z

  at this point shumway lit his match
leisurely touched it to his pipe and
dropped it still lighted in the saucepan
on the floor instantly the cotton
soaked with alcohol burst into flames
he seized the blazing object by the long
handle ran to the door and flung it far
out into the street it described a flam-
ing parabola in mid-air

  when he closed the door and turned
back into the room his guest was help-
ing himself to the whisky he quietly
sat down in the chair near the window
and watched him swallow three drinks
in rapid succession

  it opened the floodgates of his
speech moving nervously about the
small room now boastful anon tearful
he told a rambling disconnected story
of how his lifes savings had been lost
in a bank failure how he had vowed
vengeance and how he had cunningly
planned and executed the murders that
had struck terror to the city these last
few davs

  reeves and ashfield were easy he
said i merely stepped up behind
them at their desks slit their throats
and walked out eggleston was diffi-
cult i needed all my nimble wit to

enter that vacant office pick him off
with a rifle and get away clean to-
days job was simple some prussic acid
in a drinking cup sent to hubbell with
the compliments of the sanitex drink-
ing cup co a gamble of course yet
i won

  and to-morrow he said with a
flourish pausing at the table for an-
other drink of whisky i shall remove
j d hoyt of the state bank of oak-
dale i shant rest until ive killed em
all i will show up their vicious sys-
tem demonstrate that all bankers are
leeches-

  how will you kill hoyt shumway
softly interrupted

  artistically when he enters his
automobile to-morrow morning a time
bomb in the seat will explode and blow
him to atoms

  the murderer had poured another
drink of whisky as he lifted the glass
to his lips shumway reached behind
the gunny sack at the window and
rapped sharply on the pane

  in another moment the door burst
open and detective sergeants michael
sullivan and tom oshea both old
friends of shumway charged into the
room

  the ensuing ten minutes were filled
with violence for they were dealing
with a madman the table was upset
the bookcase overturned and every-
thing was smashed but when the
struggle ended he was securely tied and
handcuffed the fog had passed
the hunt was over

  some two hours later shumway sat
in the office of the chief of police the
center of a throng of policemen de-
tectives reporters and representatives
of the bankers association ambrose
niclow zander otherwise known as z
had signed a complete confession and
was now safely locked in a cell

  for what seemed the twentieth time


shumway was asked how did you
do it

  when i saw that first sheet of red
paper he answered i put him down
as a homicidal maniac and when he
committed the second murder leaving
another red sheet behind i knew i was
right it was clear to me then he was
obsessed by some real or imaginary
grievance against bankers it was also
a safe bet that he had either written a
book on banking or was contemplating
writing one and was seeking a pub-
lisher i was sure he would eventually
seek my fictitious professor zipf in
whom he recognized a kindred spirit
for publishing advice my only fear
was that he would delay too long but
the story i wrote this morning fetched
him

  what about those apple seeds
somebody asked

  they were a symbol of his wrath
an apple a day was the favorite
maxim of the president of the bank in
which he lost his savings and he says

he wanted to show that he eats apples
best who eats them last in his con-
fession by the way he boasts of hav-
ing killed that man soon after the col-
lapse of the bank were investigating
this and it is probable that in the in-
dictment another murder will be
charged against him

  shumway paused once more to gaze
with dancing eyes on the three bright-
colored checks in his hand aggregating
thirty-five thousand dollars and all
were made payable to him one of
these he promptly indorsed and gave to
captain grimm of the detective
bureau

  i want you to divide that five thou-
sand equally between oshea and sul-
livan he said they never lost faith
in my plan eccentric though it seemed
and they were right on the job when i
needed them besides he added
pocketing the thirty thousand ive
plenty left on which to get married if
the girl will forgive me for not shav-
ing to-day

would-be murderer forgot to pad rope

in what is alleged to have been an attempt to murder mrs irene lippmann

	jack lippmann her husband attached a rope to a chimney on the roof of
an apartment house lowered himself over the edge and went down the rope in
the middle of the night toward the apartment in which she was sleeping he
carried with him a butcher knife and a revolver

    two blunders saved mrs lippmann and may cost her tailor husband his
life he neglected to put a pad under the rope where it came in contact with
a cornice of the roof and he entered a window on the fourth floor instead of
one on the third failing to find his wife from whom he had been separated
two years he grasped the rope and attempted to pull himself out of the window

     by this time the rope scraping against the cornice had been virtually sawed
in two only a few strands held it together and as the tailor again swung
himself free from the building it parted his wife was asleep when he shot
past her window and she knw nothing of her narrow escape from what might
have been a terrible death until she was awakened by policeman trechtler who
told her that lippman had been taken to bellevue hospital and locked up
charged with violating the sullivan act and attempted felonious assault

     at first the police thought the tailor was a burglar but he admitted so freely
that he had planned to kill his wife and then do away with himself that his
story was accepted it was later confirmed by mrs lippman who said her
husband had attempted to enter the tenement the preceding afternoon but was
stopped and that he had sworn to get her

h here were times when the
city of culture palled on big-
nose charley and there were
occasions when dear old bos-
ton did not look upon her prodigy from
kerry village with any special degree
of proud motherhood

  giving charley the gate in the past
had served its purpose temporarily
also when there was no particular evi-
dence with which to enforce on the old
scoundrel the hospitality of the com-
monwealth however but a short time
after the opening of the automobile
show in mechanics building the bureau
of criminal investigation came into the
possession of heart-rending truths which
even the most ardent of charleys fol-
lowers at pemberton square were loath
to look upon in a spirit of amusement

  in consequence thereof big-nbse
charley had journeyed westward aboard
a freight train using the side-exit pull-
mans in preference to the varnished cars
because of the promise of comparative
privacy

  in a gun town of the middle west
there followed a period of inactivity
the old-timer rested on his laurels-
which stood him about seven thousand
dollars-and meanwhile set about re-
plenishing his wardrobe

  something after the manner of cer-
tain newly admitted nabobs big-nose
charley went forth in search of raiment
with which to adorn bedeck garnish
ornament his lanky person charleys

tastes were flashy very flashy under
normal atmospheric conditions big-nose
charleys visibility was approximately
the same as that of highland light

  the old box-man carried a cane wore
tortoise-shell wind shields and spats to
cap the climax these accesories
after a time were agumented by a
kioodle called nightingale charley
also bought an ornamental collar and a
leash

  apparently nightingale was of for-
eign birth sure enough it would have
been difficult to discover another breed
like him in north america he was the
homeliest saddest hungriest-looking
dog that ever buried a bone he had a
high melodious voice that was more re-
fined than a bay and more pathetic than
the lament of a lost soul on a dark and
stormy night

  however a sort of bond of friendship
sprang up between charley and the dog
which made them almost inseparable
when charley went on a tour of the
shopping district he dragged night-
ingale with him the mongrel never
went anywhere on a leash without being
forcefully propelled he had never
been broken to the halter and if one
were to judge by the expression on his
face he never intended to be his
canine ideas were fixed and it was too
late in life to change them

  now while it was true that the par-
ticular city where our old friend was
stopping was not open to gentlemen
big-nose charleys dog helps out



who were on the cross-in other words
living by crooked work-nevertheless
there was nothing against charleys
looking around and getting acquainted
with any persons of wealth several
individuals came to his attention in the
course of time whose business interests
centered about the jewelry trade

  beecher stack was a gem drummer
and about as glib a gentleman as ever
packed a sample case he met big-nose
charley in the hotel sheehy lobby-by
accident charley was dragging night-
ingale in an easterly direction when he
crossed mr stacks bow without blow-
ing signals the result was that the
salesman stumbled over the dog

  for the love of mud what are you
doing with a beast like that in here
yelled the irate mr stack climbing to
his feet and aiming a kick at night-
ingale get out you brute

  i beg yeh puddin apologized
charley hauling the animal clear of the
drummers battling toe im sure it
wuz a accident-want ut nightie

  ill accident im fumed mr stack
youve  business having an ugly
scrawny pest like that in a place of this
kind

  im sor-reh admrl murmured the
old rascal meekly teh tch he
moved around mr stack brushing at
imaginary specks of dust i assure yeh
ut wont happen again most unfr-
tnate thing i ever see oh my
yea-ah

  big-nose charley moved one way
and nightingale suddenly took a no-
tion to scramble the other beecher
stack representing a large jewelry tirm
in new york and having two fat wal-
lets in an inner pocket of his vest de-
sired to see just exactly what was com-
ing off behind him he turned around
red of face and still fuming in so do-
ing he backed over the tow-rope which
stretched between charley and the dog
and fell heavily against a potted pal-

metto plant behind which nightingale
was seeking refuge

  what the whooping dad-busted
sambo are you trying to do you cussed
old idiot roared mr stack coming up
like a porpoise but with one leg encir-
cled by the leash take that devilish
hound off me untie him unwind
the cur wheres the proprietor  this
hotel was all right once but its a zoo
now mr jones mr pulsifer you at
the desk get a porter to throw this-
these condemned lunatics out of this
place

  wheet wheet wheet nice doggie
nice nightie big-nose charley
sought to pacify the thoroughly alarmed
animal now ki-yi-ing for all he was
worth in anticipation of further hos-
tilities on the part of the dancing swear-
ing personage beyond the palmetto

  however nightingale was becoming
more apprehensive each instant he
backed away frantically twisting his
head and pawing and thrashing disas-
trously charley still clutched one end
of the leash and at the same time en-
deavored to soothe both the animal and
beecher stack the latter was now
swinging wildly with his fists and call-
ing down the righteous wrath of the
gods

  also nightingale had cast aside the
last particle of restraint and was howl-
ing in a manner that was calculated to
acquaint the populace with the fact that
he was one scared dog

  two porters three bell hops a clerk
the house detective and four guests
closed in and attempted to effect a res-
cue mr stack kicked at the dogs
chops a mean sidewise thrust of his
left foot while with his right hand he
jabbed at charleys nose

  this is going to cost somebody some-
thing-as sure as my name-is stack

minding his-own business in-a hotel

blinking mongrel-right in the blank-
blank lobby

  somebody tried to pull mr stack
clear of the melee and in consequence
contracted a claret nose charley now
a resplendent center of a rapidly in-
creasing attraction sought to pry the
drummer in the opposite direction from
that in which the dog was pulling and
in so doing ripped open the gentlemans
vest

  beecher stack reached for the thong
of leather which was about his right
leg and while in this stooping position
his precious wallets slipped from their
resting place to the floor a loud outcry
escaped the gem drummer as he reached
frantically for his precious stone con-
tainers he seized one and big-nose
charley secured the other which the
latter squeezed apprisingly for the brief-
est fraction of a second then he re-
turned it with as polite a bow as the
general turmoil would allow

  slowly calm succeeded chaos night-
ingale was freed from mr stacks
limb and the animal promptly backed
away with his tail between his legs and
a distrustful eye on the still seething
individual from new york charley
himself at once waxed eloquent in his
attempt to smooth out the drummers
feelings in particular and the hotel em-
ployees in general

 yuh know murmured charley
smirking at mr stack of david says
fr dogs have cempassed me an the
assembly uh the wicked has enclosed
meh oh yea-ah thats what he says
so yeh see yuh aint the first un a
kioodle has been the downfall uh

  thats all right yelled the drum-
mer but ill be the last guy that hun-
gry wolf trips up ill break his con-
founded neck-rubbing the dust from
his knees and whats more ill hang
a wallop on your ear if you say so

  tch tch charley looked aggrieved
dye think thats purty

  get out you brute before i break

your back once more beecher stack
charged threateningly at nightingale
but a polite and suave clerk diplomati-
cally headed him off while he assured
mr stack that both the hound and its
owner would be requested to leave the
hotel at once

  dont kick em out on my account
growled the distressed salesman they
can stay here until gehenna freezes
for all i care-if you can stand em
but i do want to boot that hungry-
looking mutt just once for luck

  however cooler heads prevailed and
peace was restored charley and his
dog retired both looking hurt

  mr stack loudly expressed the yearn-
ing to remain long enough around that
particular hotel to get a crack at a
human riot that didnt know any more
than to inflict his presence on a long-
suffering public by appearing with a
scrawmy beast

  id rid the community of the thing
if i was hanging around here a great
while he proclaimed violently leaning
against the desk and glaring toward the
corner where big-nose charley and his
fellow sufferer had retreated if i
wasnt going on toward the coast to-
night promised mr stack conten-
tiously id just take the evening off
and put that pair out of their misery
bah look at em my soul whered
he ever get that porcupine  whew
and the old stiff himself brains he
has nix and he wears clothes like the
chelsea fire

  big-nose charley and his dog had
been the principle topic of conversation
about the hotel sheehy lobby for a
number of days if there was ever a
cur a mongrel a dilapidated misused
imitation of a dog nightingale was that
animal and yet the resplendent old
shyster who towed the brute around
maintained that the beast was a thor-
oughbred and worth a startingly large
sum of money much to the amusement
of the guests
big-nose charleys dog helps out



  charley certainly had lavished a lot
of cold cash on nightingale so far as
care and board and a bell hop to take
the purp sight-seeing in the park went
people nodded their heads behind
charleys back and wagged the fore-
fingers of their right hands in little
circles directly above their right ears in
indication of a firmly rooted belief that
the silver-haired personage in the
shrieking clothes was gone loco
squirrel food and so forth

  but charley himself took everything
seriously while he discovered what he
could about the business of some of the
gentlemen who were forever quick to
make him the butt of facetious remarks

  the night that beecher stack boarded
a pullman sleeper westward bound
big-nose charley and nightingale also
appeared at the station and secured ac-
commodations on the same train

  and immediately matters began to ap-
proach something of a crisis

ii

  the baggageman on the southwest
express received nightingale into his
keeping with certain appropriate re-
marks about the animals appearance
and asserted loudly and earnestly that
he was no animal tamer nor did he
wish it understood that he looked glee-
fully upon the proposition of acting in
the capacity of nurse for a hyena such
as stood before him

  if id wanted to a been a animal
tamer buddy he said id be with a
circus instead of railroadin you hear
me i dont want the job of herdin a
thing like that what breed of a dog
is he anyhow

  hes a full-blooded meat hound
explained charley with a little touch of
pride in his voice an his name is
nightingale hes pedigreed an rare
as yeller-haired eskimoos

  ill say hes rare agreed the bag-
gageman i never saw anything like

him and i never expect to again huh 
meat hound eh well he dont look it
if that bow-wow ever saw a piece of
meat hed drop dead why dont you
feed im better

  hes been sick charley explained
thats what makes im look like that
anyhow them kind of dogs dont get
very fat mm an speakin uh lookin
out fr im tch in course ill make ut
wery easy fer yeh t jest sort uh keep
nightie company ill be in t see im
oncet in a while an feed im yuh
see i has t be careful uh the meat i
give im him bein diliket some prob-
ably bout twelve oclock ill come in an
give im suthint eat

  the old rascal his brain alive with a
busy little plan concerning the diamonds
which he knew the gem drummer car-
ried fished a huge roll of bills from his
kick and peeled off a twenty this he
held out toward the baggageman

  promptly the latter reached for the
bill and at the same time took the leash
from charleys hand

  ill watch over this hound like he
was a first cousin of my aunt stated
the railroad man promptly his enthusi-
asm mounting come in as often as
you want to does he howl 

  does he howl charley glanced at
the other reprovingly he sings he
corrected i pretty near had a couple
chancets to put im in grand opray but
he dont know enough furrin lan-
guidge

  big-nose charley moved down the
lane between the trunks the baggage-
man dragged nightingale to a corner of
the car and fastened him to a slat over
the steam pipes

  in a pullman near the rear of the
train beecher stack was loafing in a
borrowed section while george the
porter made up his berth after a little
he arose stretched and made his way
to the smoking compartment here he
came up abruptly

  slumped far down on a black-leather


detective story magazine

cushion was a gaudy gentleman who
was boring three others with weird tales
anent a wonderful dog in the baggage
car ahead by the name of nightingale
presently mr stack snorted with de-
rision

  some cur he exclaimed huh
gentlemen if you ever had the pleasure
of seeing that hound and on top of that
had him wound around your legs youd
be in a position to understand what a
big blow-hard this man is why that
beast hasnt got even the mark of a
dog about him

  big-nose charley glanced at the new-
comer and smiled warmly almost affec-
tionately

  mm good evenin mister stack
he said by way of greeting hope i
sees yuh well funny thing but i wuz
jst tellin these gentlemen about night-
ingale n say do yeh know what ut
says in th good book dont frget
t entertain strangers fr some has en-
tertained swell hombres without
knowin ut thats what ut says

  it does does it grunted mr stack
ungraciously humph what are you
doing following me around you and
that dad-bunked bloodhound
suddenly recognition flashed in the
eyes of another of the smoking party
lie got up

  excuse me just a minute friends
he murmured half aloud

  a moment later he drew the gem
drummer back out of sight in the nar-
row corridor

  hello hello there beecher
stack held out his hand i didnt
know you at first

  how are you stack i thought
your face was familiar it took me a
minute to place you

  well and whats on your mind
say do you know that old devil in
there  the mans voice dropped to a
whisper

  all i know about the confounded
yap is that he came into the lobby of

the hotel sheehy to-day with a blasted
dog and somehow walked around me
and before i knew it i was tangled with
the two of em

  the other grunted

  did you have any diamonds on
you 

  yes by time and before we got
unsnarled both of my wallets fell out
on the floor

  its a wonder youve got em now
stated mr stacks acquaintance that
man is big-nose charley and hes one
of the slickest crooks outside the pen
i didnt work for the jewelers pro-
tective union ten years for nothing i
havent seen the old sinner since he
pulled a job in denver in  it was
like most of his stuff-any fool could
see that no one else jot the diamonds
but it took a wise dick to pin it on him

  a crook is he the condemned old
psalm-singer why dang it bax he
picked up one of my cases and handed
it back to me as polite as pudding
thanks for the tip say what do you
know about that dog man but you
ought to get a slant at the brute what
did he do with it i wonder

  oh the animals in the baggage car
he says he gave the baggageman
twenty dollars to take care of it why
lord love you hes got a little box of
meat in his pocket for the darned beast
youd think it was caramels a lot of
little cubes and each one is wrapped in
tissue paper he was showing us he
says the stuff is scientifically prepared
meat and he doles out about eight or
ten of those inch-square pieces at a
feeding how big is the purp

  big thunder the animal is most
as big as a calf thats rich-ten little
squares of meat well heaven knows
the dog looks it lets take a walk up
ahead and look at it by and by just for
the fun of it honestly i think the old
coot is bugs by the way what are you
doing now baxter still an old gum-
shoe i suppose
big-nose charleys dog helps out



  oh yes but i havent been with
the jewelers for a couple of years now
on the pay roll of the american agency
at present well what do you say
lets go in and kid this old hyena he
dont know me i got most of my dope
on him through circulars years ago

  the two men entered the smoking
compartment and settled themselves
with a self-satisfied air there was
ahead they believed a little enjoyment
at the expense of the lanky gentleman in
the fancy clothes

  big-nose charley eyed them first one
and then the other with almost fatherly
toleration and began carefully to roll a
cigarette

  mm he murmured at last paus-
ing before touching his tongue to the
poised flap of the bit of rice paper
yeh know ol solomon says he says
debate the cause with yuh neighbor
an discover not the secret of another
hombre because he will maybe savvy ut
an give yeh the ha-ha

  george put the car to bed and then
wrapped himself in a blanket and pro-
ceeded to take a nap in an empty sec-
tion near the end of the pullman the
lights were low and a number of gen-
tlemen were snoring industriously in-
cluded in the syncopated chorus was
the voice of mr beccher stack mr
baxter crawled behind the curtains of
his berth with the intention of keeping
an eye on big-nose charley so to speak

  in the course of time well along
toward morning the tired american
agency man began to doze following
several jerky awakenings he reached
the conclusion that after all the old
crook was entertaining no evil designs
concerning mr stacks samples once
he made his way down the curtain-
shrouded aisle past no io that he
might satisfy himself as to whether or
not charley was asleep apparently

the old box-man was deep in slumber
if one was to judge by the way he
snored

  the detective retired to his berth and
partially disrobed then settled himself
for a nap nearly an hour passed
dawn was but a little more than another
hour distant suddenly the curtains of
no io stirred softly gently and a sil-
vered head appeared a pair of keen
old eyes ranged up and down the aisle

  at last the head faded from sight
in the privacy of his berth big-nose
charley snapped on the tiny electric
light then gave himself over to a careful
study of a time-table a few moments
later the man from the city of culture
fully dressed stood a few feet distant
from the head of the section where slept
mr beecher stack

  big-nose charley had given long
study to the customs of jewelry sales-
men consequently he was more or less
conversant with the habits of the
species nine times out of ten he had
learned the representatives of high-
class jewel-houses traveling in a pull-
man sleeper upon retiring removed
their wallets from an inner pocket of
their clothes and transferred the pre-
cious leathers to a place beneath their
pillows

  now the old rascal partially hidden
by the green curtains of the berth which
he pulled about him crouched low and
began the task of carefully removing
one of the gem drummers wallets

  mr stack moved uneasily and partly
rolled over charley rested on his
labors waiting until the gentleman be-
gan to snore regularly again then he
resumed his crafty attempt at lifting the
leather

  something like fifteen minutes later
our old friend of kerry village held in
his hands a wallet which contained a
small fortune in unset diamonds
swiftly charley removed eight stones
then quietly he crowded the pocketbook
back to its place beneath the pillow of


detective story magazine

beecher stack at last he sighed softly
and straightened up glancing both ways
to make sure that he was not observed

  a few seconds later the veteran of
the underworld was making his way
forward to the baggage car the bag-
gageman was warming a pot of coffee
over a small oil stove he greeted
charley with a grin apparently it was
not the old crooks first visit to the car
ahead

  you have to feed that hound mighty
regular dont you neighbor the rail-
road man wanted to know i should
think itd make you thin losing your
sleep that a way

  well yeh see me reglar walet what
nurses nightingale is went t his wiffs
ol ladys funeral so i give im a couple
days off hes goin to meet meh at
cheyenne oh yea-ah i alius has me a
walet handiest things yeh ever see
i uster has three or four on em before
i lost my fortoon mm

  big-riose charley removed a box from
a pocket of his coat which was approxi-
mately the size of a one-pound candy
box he lifted off the cover and made
his way toward the expectant night-
ingale the dog strained forward lick-
ing his chops his meals were never
overhearty but what there was of
them was tasty

  charley carefully selected a small
square of meat and removed the scrap
of tissue paper which protected it by
now nightingale was drooling and
whining the old-timer with the flashy
clothes worked the morselbetween his
fingers for a moment then tossed it to
the straining dog nightingale was an
expert at taking his lunches on the fly
he opened a yawning cavern of a
mouth and then gulped once-and was
ready for the next consignment

  it was about this time that mr bax-
ter of the american detective agency
awoke with a vague feeling that all was
not well along the potomac he grunted
sleepily and rolled over but the pre-

monition that had seemed to invade even
his dreams persisted he swung his
stockingcd feet out of his berth and for
a time sat listening

  a few seconds later he walked down
past section no  something seemed
to be lacking in the general air of things
there was no sound coming from the
berth that had been occupied by big-
nose charley the detective paused
abruptly his head turned slightly side-
wise then he pursed his lips together
and carefully pulled aside a corner of
the curtains that shielded the berth
which charley had occupied

  a very short time thereafter mr
baxter peeped in on his old friend mr
stack this gentleman evidently had
suffered no disturbing dreams he was
sleeping lustily

  the detective returned to his own
berth and slipped on his shoes there-
after a brief interval elapsed before he
entered the baggage car  big-nose
charley was just tossing the fifth cube
of nourishment to nightingale the
detective snorted

  my soul do you get up every hour
to feed that scrawny cur he demanded
peevishly watching charley unwrap
cube number six soften it in his fin-
gers crumple the tissue wrapper into
a small ball and then toss the meat to
the dog

  why how dye do mister sang-
ster charley greeted the gentleman
beaming in a fatherly way on the ex-
jewelers man aint ut good uh yuh
t get up a purpose t see that nightie
gets his food reglar was yeh afraid
id sleep over-or suthin 

  mr baxter was still carrying a hunch
that everything was not as it seemed
either this fellow was a fool and a
big fool just fit for a padded cell or-
huh-or there was something in the
wind that hadnt come to the surface
as yet the detective recalled having
heard of a case where a smuggler had
fed some precious stones to a dog in
big-nose charleys dog helps out



meat now there was something- behind
this confounded crooks actions-or
there were grounds for having the fel-
low turned over lo the police to be held
for observation

  mr baxter turned on his heel and
moved back in the general direction of
the pullman sleeper occupied by mr
stack he had suddenly resolved that
it would not be amiss if he awoke the
other and made certain that both of this
gentlemans wallets were intact

  the gem drummer sat up and rubbed
his eyes in prompt acknowledgment of
the shaking which the detective gave
him

  whats the matter he cried
what is it a train wreck

  look and see if your wallets are
all right directed mr baxter that
old fool is up in the baggage car feed-
ing that accursed hound again and i
dont know whos crazy around here

  mr stack snatched hastily at his pil-
low when it had been tossed aside
both men uttered exclamations of re-
lief

  everythings all right said the
salesman

  i must be off admitted the detec-
tive but i could have sworn that
something was in the wind i had a
hunch that we were going to pin a jolt
in stir on this guy well what do you
know about that

  almost mechanically the jewelry
drummer picked up one of the wallets
and opened it he examined its con-
tents under the rays of the electric light
in his berth and nodded a moment
later he was checking up the contents of
the second

  suddenly a cry shattered the quiet of
the pullman

  my lord yelled mr stack part
of em are gone theyre not all here
one two three-

  the detective groaned and then swore
mightily

 f-ds

  i knew it he shouted prancing in
the direction of his berth for his artil-
lery hes fecdin em to that blank -
blank meathound sure as you are
born stack the whole thing was a
plant nobody knows how long he has
been trailing you billy howland trav-
eling partner of kleinschmidt  how-
land maiden lane was followed all
over new england and finally right
in new york on a twenty-third street
crosstown car they slit his pocket and
got a wallet with thirty-eight thousand
dollars worth of diamonds in it come
on come on well get that old devil

  big-nose charley has said ten
years is a ion time to spend thinkin
how yuh might have saved yersef a trip
t the pen uts better t use yuh skull
in makin a get-away than yuh feet

  yeh know solomon says the legs
uh the simple aint equal an wisdom is
better than yeh second wind 

  big-nose charley stumbled slightly
in his quotation or it may have been
that he thought solomon stumbled and
he felt that there was room for improve-
ment be that as it may when charley
conceived the idea of robbing a gem
drummer he began to prepare the way
as he expressed it with  little thought
and deliberation

  the old-timer realized fully that he
was going up against the jewelers pro-
tective union when he stuck up a
jewelry salesman and it was said that
once a detective of this association took
the trail he seldom failed to get his man
it was accordingly necessary that he
perforin with the utmost care

  charley had felt that the gentleman
spoken to as baxter was a dick and he
was sure that both this gentleman and
mr stack had a bee or two in their
bonnets and yet this did not deter him
detective story magazine

from carrying out his original scheme
for robbing the drummer

  wliat big-nose charley desired when
he came away from the scene of his
latest escapade was a clear slate or
there would be a dick shadowing him
for the next twenty years he had no
wish for long periods when it would
be as much as his liberty was worth to
appear in any city in the united states
he hoped that fortune would smile and
allow him to pass on to new pastures
richer in purse and still in possession
of his good name

  came mr beecher stack mr bax-
ter the train conductor george and a
brakeman the aggregation were just
in time to witness the eighth cube of
meat taking flight in the general direc-
tion of nightingales red chops

  the arrival of the gentlemen was ac-
companied by loud acclaim of mouth
and mr baxter well up front was
flourishing a gun this was at once
trained  big-nose charley with a dis-
concerting promptness

  put up your hands bellowed the
detective in regulation police tones
youre just about one jump behind the
parade no funny business up with
those mitts big-nose charley i know
you and your little game is mud
oh my murmured charley half
raising his hands aint this sudden
tch tch  wh-what is ut gentlemun
youre it cried beecher stack
youve justbeen tagged where are
those diamonds you took out of my
wallet

  dimunds  murmured charley dole-
fully dimunds aint there some
awful mistake been made

  no mistake at all cried mr baxter
snappily moving toward the silver-
haired and very-much-dressed-up old
thief you took them eight of em
weve been watching you you fed
them to that blasted overgrown kioodle
just make up your mind to take it

 quietly because the two of you are go-
 ing to get off at the next stop and make
 a little visit to the police station get
 that 

   charley nodded he was almost as
 sad-faced as the dog now life was
 certainly full of pitfalls for the inno-
 cent as well as the guilty it was a
 hard old world

   nightingale cowed back a distrust-
 ful eye  the loud-voiced and threat-
 ening mr stack attention immedi-
 ately centered on charleys meat hound

- if what mr stack and mr baxter sus-
 pected were true the animal was a
 valuable dog yes he was worth four
 thousand dollars if he was worth a
 cent of course under the existing
 circumstances the animal was not ex-
 actly a treasure on the hoof

    the scraps of tissue paper which had
 so carefully encased the meat cubes
 big-nose charley crushed in his right
 hand after all life was but a sin and
 a delusion even a hard-working thief
 couldnt get a show

   mr stack turned from a contempla-
 tion of the dog to the baggageman

    whats this fellow been doing feed-
 ing the beast 

   the other nodded it wasnt every
 trip that he was entertained as royally
 as he had been to-night and hed made
 twenty bucks on top of that had the
 old beezer been feeding the kioodle
 huh

    he give im some beef cubes stated
 the railroad man with a grin

    how many did he give the brute just
 now 

   eight i been counting em for the
 last ten minutes he says if he fed
 em to the dog too fast the purp would
 probably choke himself oh my
 gorry

    charley casually tossed the crumpled
 papers which he had been holding in his
 right hand to one side

   get those commanded mr bax-
 ter dont lets allow the old bluff to
big-nose charley s dog helps out



put anything over well search him
now-and the dog later

  the engine of the train whistled its
shrill station signal and a few moments
later began slowing down

  selby junction said the baggage-
man moving toward a side door ive
got a couple trunks going off here
well hold this pair until we get
to elkins said the detective you
fellows go ahead if youve got work
to do here-with a nod at the con-
ductor and brakeman stack and i
can take care of his majesty and that
big mutt with the yellow- hair

  it was at that instant that there was
a commotion in the corner nightingale
got just one whiff of cool night air
which came to him through the open
door of the baggage car and decided
that here was where he disembarked
charley earlier that night had accom-
modatingly loosened the animals collar
and now the dog merely reversed ends
and settled back vigorously while he
fairly backed out of the hateful orna-
mental thing that fettered him

  thats a boy encouraged big-nose
charley scuffling his feet as a means of
provoking the dog to greater efforts
sic-c-ck em up go to ut

  and nightingale went if he ever
lived up to his name this early morn-
ing hour at selby junction was the
crowning moment of his career as a
soloist strategist and annihilator of
distance it is within the suitable
bounds of reason to believe that the dog
is going yet

  there was a series of yelps and howls
and then a ball of hair hurtled across the
baggage car toward the exit a troop
of infantry couldnt have stopped night-
ingale let alone one detective armed
only with a  and hampered by in-
considerate gentlemen who hopped
around in the way

  mr beecher stack saw visions of
four thousand dollars worth of precious
stones fleeing in a dog reincarnated as a

humming bird eight pieces of meat
eight diamonds

  lie made a flying tackle as the dog
came by but he might just as well have
attempted to grab the tail-end of a thun-
derbolt nightingale had made the
acquaintance of mr stack before and
he had no desire for further relations
with the gentleman

  stop im bawled the gem drum-
mer iley-y you guys out there grab
im holy cats theres diamonds in
him he wont bite muckle im
oh-h maud gracious what a bunch of
dubs there he goes there he is
as nightingale flickered under a bag-
gage truck rustled past the corner of
the station and headed toward omaha
shoot im baxter whats the mat-
ter with you for the love of mud

  mr baxter opened fire but unless he
had practiced on a sparrow at fifty
yards he stood absolutely no chance of
winging charleys meat hound the
baggageman affirmed later that without
doubt there was either ether or gun-
powder in the food that the lanky gen-
tleman in the handsome clothes had
doled out

  be that as it may when the clouds
had passed and the dust had settled
big-nose charley was proudly await-
ing the pleasure of mr baxter the
old crook had made no attempt to es-
cape instead he had offered several
mild suggestions concerning the pos-
sibility of heading off the dog by wiring
promptly to sioux city

  the old-timer unlimbered a calabash
pipe lighted it and began applying a
forced draught to a stem which seemed
to draw not at all well

  a short time thereafter charley sub-
mitted to a half-hearted search of his
person with a bored air that said all too
plainly gentlemen you are wasting
your time

  both mr baxter and mr slack were
convinced that the loot had disappeared
with the going of nightingale and


detective story magazine

much as they might suspect that big-
nose charley was the thief there was
little enough to attempt to hold him on

  later that day our friend from the
city of culture privately dissected his
calabash pipe and removed from its
flowing bowl eight diamonds that old

solomon himself could not have failed
to admire

  big-nose charley had alternately
tamped away at the pipe which he had
been a long time filling between each
cube of meat which he tossed to the
animal in the corner of the baggage car



convict ship on exhibition

n the hudson river near one hundred and thirtieth street new york the

	succcss the oldest ship now afloat is moored at the present time this ship
brings vividly to mind the treatment of criminals a century ago manacles leg
irons whipping posts branding irons leaden-tipped cats-o-nine-tails and a brine
vat all ingenious devises whereby jailers made life miserable for convicts in those
days may be seen on board this vessel

    the success was built in india in  it is constructed of teakwood and
is one hundred and thirty-five feet long with a thirty-foot beam and has a
tonnage of eleven hundred

    in the old days it was used by the british authorities to transport men
condemned to the penal colonies of australia the journey took several months
and usually twenty-four per cent of the prisoners died of disease or were killed
by their brutal keepers on the voyage until  the success was used as a
convict ship then it was scuttled in sydney harbor later it was raised and
used for exhibition purposes

attempt to revive executed criminal

decause information reached sheriff peters of chicago illinois that an
- attempt had been made to restore life to a criminal hanged in that city
the sheriff is having the bodies of executed men guarded by two deputies for
an hour after death

    nicholas viana in whose behalf the unsuccessful attempt at resuscitation
was made was hanged  december   he was pronounced dead after
fourteen minutes and the body still warm was removed to an ambulance
immediately a surgeon and a nurse began to work upon it they rubbed it
with liniment wrapped it in blankets and placed heaters beside it while the
driver drove rapidly through the loop district

    at the undertakers the body was laid on a warm slab a waiting pulmotor
wras hastily adjusted then while friends of the dead boy stood about hospital
attaches manned the oxygen pump for more than an hour listening through
stethoscopes for the stilled heart to pulse again but the attempt failed

    assistant jailer lorenz meisterheim admitted the audacious plan had come
close to accomplishing a miracle

    we investigated the story he said and learned that vianas body had
showed signs of returning life one witness said the heart had once actually
begun to beat

jrom the window of the little
brick bank rufus tench
could see most of sparta his
glance included the dingy
courthouse in the delta of the road on
one side and the frame station between
the two warehouses for cotton and to-
bacco on the other-a somnolent
threadbare little county seat already be-
ginning to drowse through the blazing
day although the sun barely had lifted
above the roof the mackrimmon house
and a broad belt of shadow lay along the
farther side of the highway

  mr tench frowned as he inspected
the familiar setting sparta perpetu-
ally offended his sense of fitness and
the offense deepened as his attitude be-
came more and more proprietary he
resented the deep dust of the road the
paintless buildings the languor of the
few inhabitants who were visible the
air of apathetic shiftlessness which lay
over the village as perceptibly as the
film of summer dust which grayed the
sod and shrubs about the courthouse

  properly managed sparta might
have been busy prosperous alive like
the faraway towns mr tench remem-
bered there was plenty of money
to be made here the surrounding coun-
try had proved fertile and no rival
settlement was within a radius of fif-
teen miles rufus tench had chosen
it with an eye to these conditions he
had made a good thing of his little
private bank very largely because his
brisk energy set him apart among the
drawling shambling natives in one of
those bustling communities he thought

of it would have been harder to start
a bank harder to make it pay harder
to retain a monopoly of the business
rufus tench was perfectly aware of
this but because he had come to feel
that sparta belonged to him he was
ashamed of the characteristics which
had mainly contributed to that result

 he scowled as he watched two
slouching darkies shuffle across the
road from the jail in the basement of
the courthouse carrying a huge basket
between them if mr tench had held
the contract for feeding the prisoners
there would be money in that empty
basket he was irritated by the re-
minder that sheriff dan mackrimmon
pampered the jail inmates on regular
hotel fare instead of giving them their
bare legal allowance

  his eye followed the pair to the cor-
ner of the rambling wooden building
which housed the hotel and rested
speculatively on the two-story porch
which masked its streetward face it
could be a little gold mine that hotel
if a business man owned it when the
court was in session every bed was in
demand  even during the dullest months
there were a few daily visitors ma-
rooned in town between the morning
train from the main line and the aft-
ernoon mixed back and the jail con-
tract alone would pay expenses

  he would not have regarded the dou-
ble galleries so bitterly if sheriff mack-
rimmon had been enjoying the revenue
which mr tench had estimated a hun-
dred times it was the knowledge that
mackrimmon barely made ends meet


detective story magazine

which exasperated him the sheriff
just about supported himself on the
proceeds of his several activities the
meager fees of his office the slender
margin of profit on the jail contract
and the hotel itself the occasional wind-
fall from the livery he operated in con-
nection with it mr tench would have
made every one of those sources more
productive and the daily contemplation
of a potential gain going placidly to
waste had come to seem almost an af-
front

  mackrimmon wouldnt sell even at
a figure well above the presumptive
value of his property he would not
consider incorporating himself and per-
mitting mr tench to secure an inter-
est he was contemptibly content to 
drift along earning a bare living from
a business which ought to have made
him rich

  the shoofly train groaned to a halt
at the station mr tench watched a
little group descend from the single
coach his eye sifting out the aliens from
the homing native traveler he scowled
more acidly than ever as he saw the
five salesmen march along the strip of
shade to the hotel instead of scattering
at once to their work it was after
eight and these men had been riding
nearly an hour but they had waited for
breakfast nevertheless mr tench
knew why at the mickrimmon house
they could buy a dollar meal for fifty
cents mackrimmon couldnt seem to
realize that prices had gone up

  he  stood in the window thinking
wdstfully of what he could do with
such an opportunity hugging his con-
tempt for the sheriff and the community
which tolerated him his lips tight-
ened and drew down as he saw mack-
rimmon leave the courthouse and come
toward him a great swollen figure in
faded blue serge a rusty wide-brimmed
black hat casting a shadow like a mask
across the upper part of his red plump
face the mans very walk was shift-

less he thought but the frown faded
when he realized that the sheriff was
headed for the bank and guessed his
errand there was a solace in the
thought of the coming interview

  mackrimmon nodded gravely and
said good morning in a slow thin drawl
the banker answered briskly

  well sheriff what can we do for
you decided to sell me that hotel
after all

  mackrimmon shook his head with-
out a smile for the mouthworn jest

  i wanted to talk to you about that
lovatt sale sir

  oh thats set for to-day is it id

forgotten- mr tench assumed

the expression of one preoccupied by
a multitude of concerns

  no-to-morrow but im kind of
busy and i wanted to talk to you be-
forehand

  what about theres no hitch is
there mr tench spoke sharply

  no sir thats all right but i
come over to see if you wouldnt let
up on young jeff a mite seems like
its kind of hard on him to lose the
place after the way hes wrorked on it
it is hard on him-of course it
ought to be a man who buys land
without having the title searched and
then neglects to record the deed de-
serves to suffer smartly sheriff what
about it

  i know the law sir its on your
side sure enough your titles good
and jeffs aint and its your land ac-
cording to the court but jeff dont
see it that way looks to him like you
and the law had cheated him and
hes worked right hard for three-four
years on that place-cleared the scrub

and planted peaches-

  sit down sheriff i want to explain
this thing to you

  mr tench placed a chair impor-
tantly mackrimmon shook his head

  reckon ill stand sir but im lis-
tening
private lessons

  just as you like you sympathize

i take it with young lovatt or you
wouldnt be here pleading his case i
want you to understand why im in-
sisting on my rights its not money
sheriff-its principle

  pie achieved the expression of con-
scious virtue with which he invariably
accompanied the useful word

  youll agree i think that if you
didnt arrest lawbreakers and if the
court didnt punish them wed have a
great many more crimes than we do
i mean that mercy would be bad for
the community perhaps bad too for
the offender himself hed go on
breaking laws until he got himself into
worse trouble

  that sounds like sense sir but

young jeff-

  youll say that he hasnt broken any
law thats exactly my point sheriff
he has hes broken a law thats older
and stronger than any statute on your
books hes been a fool and the
law of nature herself is tht a fool
shall suffer for his folly

  the sheriff pondered this deliber-
ately maybe its like you say but

on the other hand-

  stop and think if i let young
lovatt escape the just consequences of
his neglect and stupidity as you want
me to i suppose i should encourage
him in this folly he wouldnt learn
anything by this experience and i
should encourage others like him in
similar foolishness by standing on my
rights i teach him that it comes high
to be a fool and i teach the whole com-
munity that same lesson

  you aim to take the place away
from him then

  excuse me-thats not the way to
put it i intend to keep what the law
says is mine the place never belonged
to young lovatt he only thought it
did

  the sheriff nodded the door behind
him opened and a man came in a neat

alert young fellow in linen clothes-one
of the arrivals on the morning train

  dont let me interrupt gentlemen
im in no hurry he stood back as
if withdrawing removed his hat and
turned to look out of the window

  then i reckon its no use me talk-
ing to you said mackrimmon slowly
as long as it aint the money youre
after principles different if you
feel like its your duty to put jeff off
his land i expect you got to do it
im right sorry jeffs going to be kind
of hard to arrest

  arrest tench lifted his brows
again you must misunderstand
theres no criminal charge against him
hes possibly guilty of technical tres-
pass but i havent any intention of
making such a charge you have only

to dispossess him formally-

i know all that theys no charge
against him nowr i was lookin ahead
sir you go through with this and
ill be arresting jeff right quick
what for the banker scowled
why for murder sir you dont
think a hill boy like jeff lovattll leave
you take his farm from him and not
do anything about it do you i ex-
pect you dont know the breed sir
nonsense tench spoke impa-
tiently im not afraid of anything
like that hes not fool enough to risk

hanging for a bit of spite-

  excuse me mr tench but wasnt
you just saying that he was a fool and
that you had to learn him not to be
hes this kind of a fool sure enough
and when you take that land he wont
have nothing to lose i notice a man
shoots quicker when lies got nothing
n wheii hes well off jeff sure try
to kill you and hesright apt to hit
what he aims at sir

  the stranger half turned tench saw
the banker tried not to believe mack-
rimmons even drawling speech but a
persistent memory brought young jeff
lovatts face before him long narrow


detective story magazine

lean the cheeks concaved the eyes
deep-set and dark and steady he
broke out hotly

  thats a fine statement to come from
the sheriff of the county if you think
he intends to kill me its your duty to
prevent it

  yes sir thats why im here the
only way i know of keeping lovatt
from killing you is to go easy on him
or kill him first i cant lock him up
on suspicion id have to wait till he
got you and then go after him and
thatd be a mean job mr tench-yes
sir right mean i know jeff

  i take you to witness that this
amounts to intimidation tench ap-
pealed to the stranger here is the
sheriff practically threatening me with
murder if i dont surrender my unques-
tioned legal rights

  you can look at it like that if youre
a mind to mackrimmon nodded im
only telling you what i know suppose
you take jeffs note for what youre out
of pocket on this deal and give him a
clean title to the place wouldnt that
be bettern waiting for a bullet the first
time jeff got a good bead on you
teaching fools is all right mr tench
but it looks sort of risky to me

  the stranger met tenchs eye over
the sheriffs shoulder mr tench dis-
tinctly observed a faint droll droop
of one eyelid it puzzled him

  i suppose ive got to he said sulk-
ily bring me his note and ill have
the deed ready but i wont forget this
sheriff youve threatened me acted
as spokesman for a man you admit is

practically a murderer-

  youre welcome to remember it sir
i do the best i can and i hate kill-
ings in my county we aint had one
for quite a spell ill fetch you that
note right away i got young jeff
over at the hotel he plunged a great
hand into a sagging coat pocket and
exhibited a cheap revolver lucky i
saw him first mr tench a six-gun

and a grudge and a quart of blockade
liquor mix mighty mean in a hill boy
good mornin gentlemen

  he slouched heavily out leaving a
thick silence behind him it was the
stranger who broke it in a cautious
significant whisper

  youve dropped a bit of coin mr
tench iiowd you like to get it back
-with some interest

  tench surveyed him shrewdly his
grievance retreating instantly as the
hint of a business transaction chal-
lenged his sagacity his lips drew back
from his teeth in a flat mirthless grin

  i thought so you dont want me
to cash a check do you because i
wouldnt whats your game

  the stranger chuckled the same
as yours mr tench teaching fools
the high cost of foolishness i make
it pay me want it to pay you
mr tench gestured toward a chair
sit down and go on he said non-
committally but his eyes glittered

ii

  the other crossed his legs comfort-
ably

  i expect to do a little business with
some of the farmers around here and
im going to take their notes ill want
to discount them-quick thats where
you come in

  mr tench grinned faintly but he
did not permit his caller to see it his
guess he saw had been accurate this
man used his wits actively

  i see and what do i get for oblig-
ing you

  a fiat fifty-fifty split thirty-day
paper you choose the signers your-
self thats part of it tell me a few
names that are good for real money
and ill do the rest again his eye-
lid drooped slightly

  mr tench meditated he had heard
often enough of such transactions but
it had never happened that ne had been
private lessons

proposed to him till now he knew
that the innocent third party in a swin-
dle occupied an unassailable legal po-
sition and his lips went dry at the
thought even when one could charge
twenty per cent a year for a loan it
was slow business with a small capi-
tal here was fifty in thirty days

that sounds rather good he said
quietly goon whats the scheme
the stranger regarded him shrewdly
how much of it do you want to
know 

  mr tench grinned begin anyway
ill tell you when to stop

  oil stock thats all i sell em ten-
dollar shares for ten cents and take
their notes in payment that enough 
mr tench frowned you think you
could sell any stock to these people
back here you couldnt give them
government bonds

  thats my job im betting i can
if i dont youre nothing out if i
do youre in just half what i get you
cant lose either way just leave that
part of it to my silver tongue

  the banker saw the force of this
and caught the undertone of confidence
in the mans speech this fellow knew
that he could sell that stock he must
have some special method or he
wouldnt be so sure

  how do you work it

  oh im a good salesman for one
thing and i get to em by leasing their
own land first pay em spot cash for
a five-year oil lease sell em stock for
a thirty-day note dont worry about
my end of it i can attend to that
mr tench saw through it instantly
that lease would have to be signed by
the lessor and his wife too probably
and when it had been cut along the
proper lines it would become a simple
promissory note perfectly collectible at
law by any innocent third party it
was in short nothing but the ancient
swindle of the seed-oats contract mod-
ernized and improved he chuckled as

he saw the beautiful simplicity of it
everybody felt sure there was  oil
within a hundred miles of sparta to
be offered real cash for utterly worth-
less oil rights would seem to these hard-
working farmers like a sheer windfall
theyd bite-and bite hard

  lets see your lease he said shortly
the other hesitated

  sure you want to all you know
now is that i told you i was selling oil
stock and offered you good paper for
discount that i said id taken in pay-
ment better let it go at that hadnt
you

  whos going to tell what i know
or dont know let me see the lease
the stranger produced a printed sheet
of fine type and spread it  the desk
mr tench went through its clauses
methodically he had seen oil leases
often enough to recognize this as a
usual form only at the bottom where
blank spaces had been left for figures
and signatures did he find any depar-
ture from the ordinary he saw the
break between the words where the
scissors would cut the note form stood
out like a framed inscription

  that seems quite regular he said
dryly but i dont think we can do

business mr-

  layton said the other and
youre dead wrong we can do busi-
ness and were going to this is a
quick turnover-the softest money
youll see in a lifetime-and the safest

you dont risk a cent and-

  i dont like it its not in my line
i wont split any better than fifty-
fifty said layton tartly no use
trying to boost me that way

  im not interested repeated tench
he meant it he had steered fairly
near the wind in the matter of the usury
laws but this was different no scruple
restrained him but fear was more po-
tent this was fraud safe as it seemed
he ached for the easy profit it offered
but he was afraid

  thats too bad layton half closed
his eyes i was rather counting 
you youd like a chance to get back
at the sheriff wouldnt you i thought
id begin with him i heard he had a
little farm outside of town-

 mr tench jumped you mean
youd have the nerve to try it on him

  would i  why im going to char-
ter him and his buggy to drive me
around to sec the others im going to
make him help me sell em when the
plugs pulled hell be holding the bag
and looking foolish too you watch
me

  mr tench leaned forward ill do
it he said huskily take down the
names daniel mackrimmon up to-up
to fifteen hundred h d fraser a
thousand lawrence neil a thousand
and-

  thats enough said layton pres-
ently ill be in with the notes some
time this afternoon have the cash
ready

  mr tench nodded a brilliant idea
came to him and he instinctively
avoided laytons eye lest his own re-
veal too much

  he saw layton cross the road to the
hotel and a few minutes later mack-
rimmon brought over jeff lovatts note
for a thousand dollars with a quit-
claim deed for tenchs signature

  mr tench signed it almost happily

iii

  son i need the money but im
bound to tell you they aint a drop of
oil anywheres around here its plumb
foolish to fool with this idea you got
mackrimmon wagged his head

  layton chuckled

  thats my lookout sheriff if i
want to throw my money away it
shouldnt worry you

  maybe not but i wouldnt feel
right about leavin you throw it away
into my pocket son

  layton hesitated he leaned toward
the other confidentially

  i see ill have to tell you after all
but i wish youd keep it quiet if i
do its just a gamble of course like
any oil speculation but it looks good to
me ive had a man scouting around
here making sure and im putting a
small bet on his report i dont know
that theres oil here but i think there
is-think so hard enough to risk a lit-
tle change on leases and trial wells
now you know where i stand
youll lose it persisted mackrim-
mon the best oil folks have looked

us over-

  and theyve overlooked a good many
other winning bets too dont you
worry about me sheriff ive been in
this game quite a while and its paid
me good money right along

  the sheriff inspected him attentively
over the lifted lower lids of very bright
blue eyes

  well if you feel that way about it
i reckon i can stand it if you can lets
see the lease

  layton exhibited the printed form
and mackrimmon read it carefully he
nodded it looks all right to me son
but i reckon i better take it up to judge
keever and leave him go over it you
dont object to that do you

  glad to have you ill save argu-
ment with the others if youre satisfied
that its all right layton spoke heart-
ily

  mackrimmon plodded away return-
ing after a quarter hour with judge
keevers assurance that the lease was
entirely in order he signed it form-
ing the letters clumsily

  a barefooted negro boy fetched a
horse and buggy to the front door and
the two men climbed into it the sher-
iff taking the reins as they drove
down the main road rufus tench stood
in the bank window watching lay-
ton did not glance at him
private lessons



  pretty sharp customer that banker
of yours he said

  reckon so son rufe tench is
mighty near as sharp as he thinks he
is he chuckled they drove out of
the village over a deep-rutted sandy
road which wound between fields of
cotton and tobacco and lifted over
ridges crowned with thrifty orchards
of young peach trees

  before noon they had made two calls
and secured signed leases at each the
sheriff to laytons relief advised his
constituents to accept his offer

  its twenty-five dollars sure hobe
and a seventh of all the oil they find
on your place and you get the rights
back in five years if they dont strike
oil before then judge kcever advised
me to lease my place and i done it
he drew up at a rickety cabin in a
hollow after leaving the fraser farm

  you didnt say nothing about leas-
ing this here land son but i reckon
you ought to have it and sim pittenger
he needs the money right bad too
layton shook his head dont want it
the report doesnt mention him his
land doesnt lie right id say better
get -want to finish up in time to
catch that afternoon train out sheriff
mackrimmon did not argue the matter
and they reached the neil place at din-
ner time sharing a meal in the open
gallery between the two wings of the
farmhouse and signing another lease be-
fore neil went back to the fields

 it was drawing on toward four
oclock when they reached the town
again layton mopped his neck with
a wadded handkerchief

  guess ive got time for a quick bath
before the train goes he said ill

take a room-

  no need to waste the money son
youre welcome to use the bathroom
want room to dress in layton said
laughing you ought to soak me for
it sheriff you hotel folks have to
make your money when you can

  the grinning darky shambled around
the corner of the porch and took the
bit while the two climbed down lay-
ton laughingly insisted on renting a
room and uncle jimmy sty gall in-
terrupting his afternoon perusal of yes-
terdays paper laid aside the thick read-
ing lens with which he helped his pur-
blind eyes and stumped upstairs to
pilot him the sheriff lowered him-
self to a wide chair in the dusky cool-
ness of the office folded his hands
across his stomach and let his head
droop forward

  uncle jimmy found him so when he
came back and did not interrupt him
he read diligently the thick handglass
lifted almost to his nose the newspaper
hardly an inch away from it

  youll wear them eyes plumb out
uncle jimmy said the sheriff mildly
have one of them headaches if you
dont quit

  the old man grumbled but yielded
laying the glass on the counter beside
the register

  layton came to the inner door he
was in his shirt-sleeves

  say sheriff whats the matter with
your lights none of the bulbs up-
stairs seem to work

 uncle jimmy snickered aint
nothing the matter with them lights
come sundown theyll work all right
whatd anybody tfant of a light in the
daytime

  i like to shave by electric light
said layton quickly not till sun-
down eh what time is that
lights go on at seven said the
sheriff without looking up have to
let the pond fill up daytimes r they
wouldnt be no power at all

  layton hesitated oh well it
doesnt matter ill get along without
the shave he stopped what time
does that train go did you say
five-four said uncle jimmy
you aint got much time for a bath
mister


detective story magazine

  ill take a quick one layton dis-
appeared and a hissing sound in the
pipes presently announced that the tub
was filling the two men sat in the
darkened office the sheriff nodding over
his folded hands there was a long si-
lence then uncle jimmy said

  fine thing lights in daytime
like to shave by one the feller said
never heard of such a fool business
it aint so foolish as it sounds un-
cle jimmy the sheriff still spoke
mildly you take and lay down a
spell while i tend the office i got
some thinkin to do uncle jimmy
the old man shuffled away and the
sheriff resumed his meditations he
glanced up at the noisy clock from
time to time at five oclock there was
still no sign of layton and mackrim-
mcn stumped to the foot of the stairs

  hey son train starts in four
minutes

  a violent splash answered him then
laytons voice

  gad i forgot all about it cant
make it now have to take the next
one

  thats to-morrow morning you
know

  pshaw thats too bad i wanted
to get the express north say sheriff
couldnt you drive me over to the main
line after supper that train doesnt
go up till eleven something and its
only twelve miles isnt it

 guess i could mackrimmon
nodded have to charge you pretty
high though

  layton laughed thats all right-
stick me all you please i deserve it
the sheriff went back to his chair
his eyes sagged shut and he sat very
still a feeble grin showing at the cor-
ners of his mouth he was still sit-
ting so when mr tench closed up his
bank and came across the road to sup-
per

  mr tench was in a bad humor he
had spent nearly two hours looking out

of his window at the doorway of the
hotel and waiting for layton to appear
he scowled at the drowsing sheriff and
stalked past him going upstairs to his
room there was no sound from the
lower floor as he waited in the upper
hall listening he identified mr lay-
tons room by a cheerful whistle from
behind its door and he tapped care-
fully at the scarred panels

  mr layton thrust a bath-wet head
into the hall and shook it warningly

  after supper he whispered i
got him all right but we better play
it safe he looks pretty soft but you
cant always tell

  tench grumbled under his breath
but his eye lighted nevertheless at the
news that the sheriff was hooked he
possessed his soul in as much patience
as the circumstances permitted while
he waited for the brazen summons of
the supper bell his thoughts were
pleasing

  if the sheriff had really signed a pre-
sumptive note for any considerable sum
mr tenchs ancient ambitions concern-
ing the hotel were already well on their
way toward fulfillment when the note
came due there would be no cash to
meet it there never was any cash in
sparta unless it was borrowed from
rufus tench and it wasnt likely that
any outside bank would care to loan
money on a property like the hotel it
couldnt show a profit on paper or oth-
erwise under the sheriffs management
nobody except mr tench himself saw
any possibility of gain in its tumble-
down paintless building the property
would go under the hammer as a good
many others had gone since mr tench
had come to sparta

  he grinned acidly at a bright mental
picture of sheriff mackrimmon engaged
in selling out hotel-keeper mackrimmon
to satisfy the judgment which that note
would surely yield and he foresaw
too that the sheriff would loudly pro-
test when the trap closed and thus re-
private lessons



veal himself to the community as a
person of such simplicity that he could
hardly be considered a fit occupant of
such an office as he now held every-
body would laugh at him mr tench
was comfortably certain of this

   the liberal supper he consumed pres-
ently he resented as if it represented
a loss to his own pocket when the
hotel belonged to him he would speed-
ily alter this wasteful habit of over-
feeding guests at a ridiculously low fig-
ure hed fire those old darkies who
wasted money in the kitchen and put
in a businesslike cook the first thing
and hed send that doddering old fool
uncle jimmy packing off to the vet-
erans home too he was just a dead
weight on the business

   a little paint he told himself and
some new furniture not too expensive
would bring the place near enough to
modernity to warrant doubling its pres-
ent schedule of prices hed make it
show a pretty profit from the first
week

  his impatience brought him to mr
laytons elbow the moment the meal
was over and the stranger left the
table for a cigarette on the gallery lay-
ton shook his head again

   wait till dark he whispered you
be over at your office in about an hour
and ill drop in when its safe you
dont want to figure in this thing any
more than you have to

  mr tench saw the force of this
advice the fewer circumstances in-
dicating a close acquaintance between
himself and layton the safer the sub-
sequent proceedings must be he
crossed the road and unlocked the bank
door it was beginning to darken now
and the filament inthe bulb over his
desk glowed to a feeble red as he pulled
down the green window shades

  he unlocked his safe and extracted
a compact sheaf of worn bills which
jie laid on his desk and counted lov-
ingly most bankers would have re-

turned money in this condition to the
treasury but mr tench hatgd to think
of a bill being destroyed he liked
the look and feel of old bank notes far
better than of new there was an ef-
fect of value in soiled crumpled bills
which endeared them to him new
money represented nothing but the gov-
ernments assertion of worth  old hand-
worn notes somehow had acquired an
intrinsic value they stood for the la-
bor by which calloused hands had
wrung them out of the earth or nimble
wits won them from trade mr tench
caressed the rough surfaces affection-
ately as he counted one bill had been
torn almost across and he stopped his
count long enough to repair it care-
fully with neatly scissored strips of
gummed paper

  a thousand dollars in fives and tens
and twenties made quite a respectable
bundle he thought it was a pity to
spend it perhaps he could avoid even
that if he was clever about it the
strategic advantage in the coming in-
terview lay altogether with him lay-
ton was nothing but a common crook
who couldnt run any risk of exposure
rufus tench was a respectable and
honest banker whose position was
legally unassailable why should he
throw away a thousand dollars when
a hundred would suffice

  he meditated leisurely over this idea
finding it more and more appealing by
the time a quiet tapping at his window
glass announced the arrival of his fel-
low conspirator he had definitely de-
cided to try it

  mr layton sidled nimbly past the
edge of the door his keen face alert

  must hurry now ive got the old
boy out of the way hitching up to
drive me over to the main line lets
hustle here you are

  he put a handful of documents on
the counter mr tench snatched at
the uppermost one he could sec
where it had been cut from a larger


detective story magazine

sheet the margins were so narrow
that the type nearly fell over the edges
but it was a note in due legal form for
fifteen hundred dollars and it bore the
signature of daniel mackrimmon mr
tench was wholly familiar with that
awkward clumsy script his fingers
trembled a little as he held the paper

  ive got a total of four thousand
there said layton hurry up
brother-theres no time to lose

  mr tench deliberately examined the
remaining notes they were all in or-
der and each signed by a man perfectly
good for the amount he knew that
he could force collection of every penny
of their value or if he was obliged to
take judgment and levy on property he
could probably collect a great deal more
than the face of the notes it was not
a speculation but a sure thing

i been thinking it over since this
morning he said and i dont feel
like going into it its too dangerous
laytons eyes narrowed and his lips
tightened flatly over his teeth

  i was waiting for that he said
quietly i suppose you figure that
you can only afford to pay about fifty
cents for this little wad of paper eh
i dont want it at any price said
mr tench

  you dont eh laytons eye glim-
mered oddly you were never more
mistaken in your life you want it so
badly that youll pay me sixty per cent
of the face instead of fifty and an-
other crack like that will cost you an-
other ten-per-cent boost trot out
the coin and quit bluffing youd buy
that mackrimmon note at par if you
couldnt get it cheaper i know your
number tench think i make my liv-
ing out of this game without spotting
a cheap crook when i meet one come
through

  mr tench made a feeble attempt at
bluster layton interrupted him tartly

  seventy per cent now and in ten
seconds more itll be eighty come on

  i-i cant ive only got a thou-
sand dollars on hand quavered the
banker he did not like the ugly glint
in the other mans look crooks were
dangerous people he remembered
men had been killed for less money
than lay in his desk drawer

  hand it over said layton curtly
mr tench observing that one of his
hands rested conveniently in the pocket
of his coat tremblingly opened the
drawer and produced the bills

  now the other thousand--and
quick said layton

  mr tench protested quite truthfully
that he had no more currency on hand
he had taken the precaution to put
the rest of his cash under the safe so
that when he opened it and allowed
layton to look for himself his state-
ment had a color of fact the swin-
dler glanced at his watch hesitated

  all right you get by with it he
said and snarled but youll wish you
hadnt before im done with you ill
come back here and trim you right one
of these days

  he thrust the bills into his inner
pocket and sidled out mr tench
watched him through a gap in the cur-
tain as he crossed the road and en-
tered the hotel he reappared almost
at once climbed into mackrimmons
buggy and was driven briskly down
the road and out of sight mr tench
lovingly recovered his cash from be-
low the safe and locked it away with
the precious notes he was distinctly
pleased with himself hed made a
cold profit of three thousand dollars-
a thousand more than hed expected it
was the best days work of his career

iv

  mr tench was still awake when
sheriff dan mackrimmon came in after
his twenty-four mile drive it was al-
most morning but the banker had not
been able to sleep for thinking of the
private lessons



sheriffs face when that note should be
presented for payment llis mind was
full of plans for the reconstruction of
the hotel when it should come into
his hands at the auction sale which that
note would precipitate

  he heard mackrimmon come up the
creaking stairs and he felt his face
twist into its nearest approach to a
smile the sheriff was humming
faintly under his breath a plaintive
negro hymn

  you wont see me here again

  goin to hebn onna mornin train

  my sin been taken away

  mr tench chuckled the sheriff
never lapsed into music except when
he was in excellent humor probably
layton had paid him five dollars for
that all-night drive thought tench and
the old simpleton was all swelled up
over such a profit

  he overslept and came down late for
breakfast in a sullen humor mack-
rimmon greeted him with his usual re-
served courtesy and the banker growled
in answer in thirty days hed have a
pretty bomb to explode under this fat
stupid fellow

  the time passed slowly while he
waited for the calendar to bring him
his triumph the last week of that
month seemed endless every meal he
ate at the hotel impressed him as a
deliberate theft from him in any live
town that much food would bring a
dollar or more it was assassinating
value to feed casual travelers so some-
times he almost protested and restrained
himself only by a sharp effort

  on the thirty-first day he stopped at
the office on his way out

  oh sheriff-theres a little note of
yours due to-day id like to have you
drop in and settle it if its perfectly
convenient

  mackrimmon regarded him placidly

  reckon theys some mistake mist
tench i aint signed ary note

  tench smiled thinly im afraid

you have sheriff ive got one which
is certainly signed by you drop over
and see for yourself

  he went out hugging his exultation
lie had rehearsed the coming interview
over and over as he waited for to-day
to come he knew exactly what he
would say when mackrimmon came
over to the bank

  at ten the sheriffs big form appeared
in his doorway tench bustled over to
his safe and extracted the envelope in
which he had filed the notes

  here we are sheriff take a look
at that

  mackrimmon bent over the paper
tench watched him happily waiting for
the explosion he was sure would come
but mackrimmon only nodded slowly

  i kind of thought it might be that
he said when i see that feller in here
in the mornin and come over again
after supper-that oil feller i mean-i
had a notion he might be goin to do
business with you

  oil mr tench lifted his brows
this man brought me some perfectly
good paper which i discounted for him
but i dont remember anything about
oil hold on though-he did tell me
that hed taken the notes in payment for
stock in some company it might have
been an oil company too i hope you
havent been speculating sheriff oil
stocks are risky investments

  thats how he worked it eh 
mackrimmon nodded i was wonder-
in what story hed give you o course
a smart man like you mist tench
wouldnt buy paper from a stranger
without some pretty good yarn to ex-
plain it he didnt sell no stock-all
he wanted was leases and he paid cash
for em i was with him eveywhere
he stopped these notes aint notes at
all-reckon he must have clipped em
out of them leases ive heard of such
games before now

  i dont know what youre talking
about mr tench bit off the words


detective story magazine

the notes in order and ill need
the money sheriff i hope youre ready

  he stared as the sheriff produced a
thick roll of bills
i did come over here to pay a note
said mackrimmon gently but i reckon
i wont pay this here one sir i didnt
sign it-all i signed was a lease for
the oil rights out to my farm

  i have nothing to do with that ive
bought this paper in good faith and i
must insist on your settling it or i shall
be obliged to protest and sue i need
the cash for other investments

  i wouldnt if i was you sir
mackrimmon spoke very quietly but a
curious hardness appeared in his blue
gentle eyes if i was you sir id
put them notes back in my pocket and
say nothin to nobody about them you
know its a swindle sir you must have
knowed right along that we-all never
signed any such papers it wouldnt
look neighborly for you to help a stran-
ger cheat us folks around here sir
mr tench laughed shrilly thats
good im to lose four thousand dol-
lars because you people have been fool-
ish enough to bite on some crooked
scheme you tell me that this man
wanted oil leases eh well why did
you take his money when you knew
there was no oil there you thought
you were cheating him eh and hes
cheated you it serves you right
maybe mackrimmons broad
pink face settled to its normal placidity
you aim then to sue on these here
notes you aim to help this slick fel-
ler swindle us home folks

  i certainly do mean to collect whats
due me if youve been fools you de-
serve to suffer ive told you before
how i stand on that sheriff its my
duty as well as my right to collect these
notes-itll teach you and the others not
to be so easy next time youre not
being cheated-youre paying for your
education a wise bird like sheriff

mackrimmon caught on that moss-
grown swindle i dont see how you
can afford to have this get out sheriff
youd better settle quietly and keep
your job youll be laughed out of it
if the county ever hears about this
mackrimmon was silent for a mo-
ment then he spoke slowly

  you figger thats square mist
tench if it was you t had bit on a t
hook like that would it look decent and
neighborly to you if the other feller
was to haul you in and string you
through the gills

  of course it would im always
willing to pay for my education if i
needed to learn a lesson like this sher-
iff id not only pay the man who taught
it to me but id thank him it would
be cheap at the price

  the sheriff settled his chin comfort-
ably on his flat collar

  thats what i thought sir it makes
me feel all right about this here busi-
ness to know you look at it that a way

i aint forgot what you said about jeff
lovatt that time you was fixin to take
his land offn him guess it comes high
to get sense sometimes but as longs
youre satisfied i reckon eveybody is

  i dont know what youre talking
about sheriff

  no well i reckon i can make it
clear if you give me time you re-
member that oil fellert sold you these
here notes he tackled me first off to
sign that there lease of hisn and right
then i kind of smelled a rat i knowed
they wasnt no oil in this county and
i told him so but he said he was
willin to risk it so i took uncle
jimmys readin glass and had a look
at the lease it was all right i took
it up to judge keever and he said it
was safe to sign so i done it and let
four-five other folks do it too

  thats got nothing to do with me

it may be as you say but it doesnt
matter all i know is that these notes
are perfectly legal and that-
private lessons



  wait this feller was in a mighty
hurry to get back to town in time to
catch the shoofly back to the main line
that same afternoon he kep me driv-
in along right fast but when we got
to the hotel what does he do but hire
a room and start in to take a bath
funny eh whatd you think if youd
been me

  it has nothing to do with me-

  maybe it has im gettin there sir
you jest wait a mite this feller lay-
ton went up to his room but he come
down again in a minute and wanted to
know why the lights wasnt on i told
him we only had lights at night and
he looked sort of mad but he went back
upstairs and started in to take his bath
stayed in the tub till train time thats
how come he missed it and stayed over
for supper got me to drive him over
remember 

  yes yes no doubt but all this
is quite beside the po sheriff
maybe you see mist tench
when he started talkin v ease to me
i figgered that he must b up to some
trick r other and right away i thought
of the old swindle they used to work
years ago-get a feller to sign some
perfectly harmless paper and then cut
it in half and have an iron-clad note
but me and judge keever we looked
all over that lease of hisn and they
wasnt no way it could be cut sos to
make a note outn it i saved the one
he give me you cn see for yourself
mr tench barely glanced at the
printed sheet he guessed that the
astute mr layton had furnished a
harmless specimen for purposes of ex-
amination and secured his signatures to
a slightly different document

  i dont know anything about all this

its nothing to do with me sheriff-

  not even when i told you he wanted
a light-in the middle of the afternoon
and missed his train sos to stay here
till the lights come on im right dis-
appointed in you mist tench i shd
f-ds

think a thing like thatd make you guess
right off that he was up to somethin
it only took me a coupla days to figger
it out and i aint what youd call
smart

  what do you mean mr tench
was vaguely aware of a sudden cold-
ness in the pit of his stomach lights
what had lights to do with this

  i guess i know now how he done
it said the sheriff i found the glass
loose in a picture of general jackson
t hangs in the room he had kind of
simple trick too he got us to sign
them leases and then he carried em
up to his room and laid that pane of
glass on a coupla books or somethin
sot he could plug the light connection
and run a light under the glass then
he jest spread a lease on the glass laid
one of these here note forms over it
and traced the signatures as easy as
winkin ive read about that trick but
i never seen it done

  he fumbled in his breast pocket and
drew out uncle jimmys thick-lensed
reading glass

  take a look at that writing mist
tench see how the lines is made up
of a lot of little strokes  nobody never
signed his name that a way its a
plain forgery and i reckon if this gets
to a cot we-all cn prove it

  little beads of sweat broke out on
tenchs face as he stared at the mag-
nified signatures and confronted die
realization that he had no possible re-
dress at law except against the van-
ished mr layton

  im right glad you aint complainin
mist tench because itd only make
folks think you want much of a
banker drawled mackrimmons gentle
voice an maybe youre right about
a lesson coinin cheap at the price i
reckon you wont have to learn this
one again sir his eyes narrowed
what floors me sir is the way he
fooled you that writin dont look


detective story magazine

very good i been wonderin whether
you wasnt maybe expectin him to bring
you some notes like these here-expect-
in so hard that you didnt look at em
close but thats jest guessin o
course

  mr tenchs mind moved quickly he
couldnt afford to complain too much
or other people would ask exactly that
question a thousand dollars-he quiv-
ered at the thought of losing it but
there was no help for it and the sher-
iffs next speech brought him a measure
of comfort

  the note i thought you was wantin
me to pay was different sir i come
over here to see you about that paper
of jeff lovatts it aint due yet but
if youre a-wantin to get in some cash
id jest as lief buy it off you

  mr tench stared buy it where
how but he couldnt speculate about
that now a chance to recoup his losses
was too precious to be missed he
fetched the lovatt note and the sheriff
tendered a thick wad of bills mr
tench counted them his fingers shak-
ing

  suddenly he looked up and his mouth
opened one of the bills had been torn

half across and carefully mended with
gummed paper his memory groped
toward a sudden incredible suspicion
the sheriff had driven layton over to
the train with this very money
he caught his breath for an accusa-
tion and then under the unwinking
gaze of the placid blue eyes he realized
the hopelessness of it

  he signed the note as paid and slid
it over the counter the sheriff folded
it deliberately and sighed

  i guess we-all have learned some-
thin outn this here business mist
tench you can buy right smart ex-
perience with a thousand dollars sir
i wonder how much this here thou-
sands done paid for sir

  and he slouched away leaving mr
tench to guess at the reason why he
had come home singing after that night
drive over to the main line and to won-
der whether mr layton had also se-
cured a thousand dollars worth of edu-
cation out of that excursion as for
himself although he had emerged ex-

automobile bandits defy parisian crowds

pour automobile bandits perpetrated a sensational daylight robbery in paris

	recently descending from a big limousine which they had stolen a few
hours before the quartet smashed the show window of the levi jewelry store
on the boulevard st martin in the center of the city and made off with about
forty thousand dollars worth of gems the supply of gasoline in the car was
exhausted when the robbers had gone a short distance so they abandoned the
automobile and escaped on foot with their booty

    the robbery was committed at eight oclock when many persons were on
the boulevard four men wearing ultramodern suits caps and gloves drove
up to the jewelry store at high speed one broke the window with a hammer
and another fired pistol shots into the store to terrorize any one who might
be within while the other two armed with a cavalry carbine and an automatic
iired volleys in opposite directions along the boulevard as a warning to passers-by
not to interfere two of the thieves gathered up the trays of diamond rings
watches and necklaces of pearls and precious stones and tossed them into a
sort of apron one of them wore swiftly but coolly then the four regained
the limousine and still firing their pistols and carbine at random dashed off
up a side street the whole affair happened in about six minutes

chapter xiii

the rescue

ie story of bobs splendid at-
tempt to rescue rosie millar
is quickly told in the hope
that the child would be
spared as long as no attempt was made
either to carry the house by storm or
enter it from the rear he conceived the
idea of taking the big convict by strat-
egy to make the plan effective he
had first to impersonate the smaller of
the convicts in this he was aided by
a photograph of the man who had just
been caught and of whose capture the
giant was fortunately unaware bob
further reasoned that by creating an
apparent disturbance among the depu-
ties and then dashing for the house he
might deceive the giant into the belief

that his companion had but just been
discovered and was trying to escape
if he succeeded in reaching the house
he was to shoot the outlaw on the in-
stant

  the plan so simple in conception
was yet so seemingly difficult in execu-
tion that sheriff millar at first flatly
refused to countenance it on the
ground that bob would be shot down at
the very start but at last he yielded
and it was arranged that a volley was
to be fired after bob should have bro-
ken away from the deputies he was
then to stagger and fall and to make
the deception complete he was to carry
red paint in his hand with which to
smear his face at the moment of fall-
ing a revolver was to be concealed
under his coat to prevent his being
shot by the mob the deputies were in-

structed carefully to explain the plan
to every person who was armed

  mut supposing you dont fool him
the sheriff asked

  bob glanced toward the window
do your part in the plan thats all
i ask he said shortly his lips were
quivering when he added tell jim its
all right

  mr harding sheriff millar said
impulsively grasping bobs hand im
not acting on the square with you i
havent been ive made a bluff about
not letting you take the risk but all
the time ive been praying in my heart
for you to take a chance id not let
you do it if my lame leg wouldnt give
me away but you-

  i know bob answered quietly
even as he fought against the strain of
the supreme uncertainty

  to all appearances the plan of res-
cue was working without a flaw for
as bob after falling under the first vol-
ley rose and continued his dash the
doubting deputies looked on with rising
optimism yet there was a disastrous
flaw for it transpired that two men
either as the direct result of careless-
ness or through a cruel misunderstand-
ing fired with too accurate an aim
bob was shot in two places one bullet
grazing his temple and the other pass-
ing through his left side just above the
hip

  he was not conscious of having
fallen but as he dragged himself up
and started again he heard the shouts
of the crowd and the sound of many
rifles all about him rose little clouds
of bullet-tossed dust as he ran he
knew he was growing weaker and he
strove to hold on until the time for us-
ing his revolver then more shouting
and another volley the sounds came
to him faintly yet they aided him in
his struggle for self-mastery still un-
beaten he looked again toward the
house and to his dismay saw the out-
law in the act of aiming the great re-

volver a groan was forced from him
as he tottered forward waving his
hands in mute protest then through
the maze of his weakness he saw dimly
one faint vapory final chance and
took it

  dont shoot joe he exclaimed
calling the outlaw by name and dra-
matically reaching out his arms as he
plunged forward you know me
dont letm git me let me in

  he had no strength for further en-
treaty his distress was real his ap-
peal that of a man desperately in need
of friendly help the big outlaw
raised the revolver aimed quickly and
fired the bullet speeding harmlessly
over bob plowed its way into the thigh
of a deputy shouting a warning to
the crowd he left the window taking
the child with him as yet he was un-
suspecting of the trick that was being
played to his defeat bob was now
within twenty-five feet from the house
but those few feet seemed to him a
great distance which he might never
cover lie called upon his shattered re-
sources to meet the final the real en-
counter and reached for his revolver
it was gone

  but he must not turn back he must
keep on and on until he reached the
house he must be at the door when
it should be opened and then he must
put all his remaining strength into one
supreme effort he reached the door
there was a sound from within some
one was coming to the door he
braced himself ready to spring
quick joe quick

  he saw the knob turn and the door
cautiously and sparingly begin to open
he flung it wide and dashed in

  the outlaw was holding the little
one under one arm while in his other
hand he held his revolver it was
cocked bob grasped the giants wrist
and gave it a wrench and a twist that
brought forth a sharp cry of pain the
revolver fell to the floor and went off
masked revenge



with a loud report the murderer
screamed he had been shot in the
foot before he could recover from
the shock of his surprise and pain bob
twisted and held his arm in a manner
that made resistance torture in his
attempt at self-defense the fiend
dropped the child but bob gave him
no chance to use his great strength
tightening a relentless jujutsu hold on
his wrist he dragged him roughly from
the house calling to the child as they
struggled through the doorway shut
the door rosie quick

  but the little one was terrified be-
yond the power to reason at the mo-
ment of her release she had rushed into
an adjoining room and shut herself in
a closet with the front door still un-
fastened the fate of the child was still
in doubt in his struggle to reenter
the house the giant ignored his
wounded foot but his desperate resist-
ance against the cruel hold on his wrist
caused him to repeat his outcries yet
he fought on with the ferocity of a
trapped grizzly and slowly drew nearer
and nearer to the entrance once more
bob called to the child then strove
with all his fast-waning strength to re-
tain his scientific hold on the giant

  of his final struggle he had but a
vague dreamlike recollection he re-
membered being thrown about and
crushed under a great weight wonder-
ing all the while why the sheriff did
not help him through it all he kept
his hold on the massive wrist while
the cry the child the child went
ringing through his brain to save her
was his supreme thought his last sus-
taining link between consciousness and
oblivion but the strain was too great
and he suddenly lost his hold and was
hurled to the ground yet he had
played his part well for as he yielded
to his weakness the crowd closed in

  the outlaw fought with the frenzied
fierceness and brute strength of a
maniac yet with the cleverness of a

trained athlete he knocked strong
men insensible by blows from his great
fists and others he lifted and hurled
through the air as if they had been
mice a bullet grazed his temple the
blow from a billy cut an ugly gash in
his forehead he only fought the
harder for the moment he seemed
more than a match for the combined
forces against him it was the sheriff
who evading a powerful blow slipped
between his legs and tripped him in-
stantly several determined stalwart
men were upon him and the fight was
over

chapter xiv

bob turns detective

at the home of sheriff millar under
the care of an old colored servant
bob fought a winning battle with death
the faithful woman never left her pa-
tient during the trying days of his un-
consciousness and delirium and it was
her soft-spoken words and gentle touch
alone that soothed him in those dan-
gerous moments of his violent ravings
not until the crisis had passed would
she leave him

  touched by his courage and patience
and his thoughtful consideration for
others she grew to love him with that
spirit of devotion so deep-rooted in the
character of the old-time colored ser-
vant with her love for him went her
trust and she gossiped freely about the
people and things identified with her
immediate world she took particular
delight in talking about the winters
and while she had a great fondness for
the old man she could not indorse his
act of marrying a woman so many
years younger than himself

sibly get away

  i reckn dats so mistr bob she

  bob gave a slight start he inter-
preted in her words a hidden meaning
and he asked his next question before
he was conscious of having formed it
where is he

easily de sheriff he didn hab quite

clared but dat convict nebber hed no

 she answered bending still closer

   sincerity of belief and alarm were
clearly depicted in her emotional face
and bob was more fully impressed than
he allowed her to see wtiy do you

bum corned to an de doctr he tole her

whisper mistr bob she doan know

   they were conversing on the front
porch and bob covered by a blanket
reclined in a steamer chair a short
distance down the road riding leisurely
in their direction was jim he was
mounted on a handsome horse belong-
ing to the winters at whose home he
had been stopping since the time of his
brothers injury

old woman rising in haste but now

  with this she left him and from that
moment bob took an active interest in
the affair

  hello bob jim called from the
road uncle winters wants to know
when youre going to put in those two
weeks with them

  doctor eastman says i can go over
day after to-morrow how is the old
chap

  fine answered jim as he tied his
horse of course hes got to crawl
round on crutches for a while but hes
coming out all right giving his horse
a parting caress he hurried toward the
house and as he reached the porch
steps he burst out i say bob you
ought to see mrs winters working in
her gym and you just ought to see
her put up the fifty-pound dumb-bell
gosh talk about strength before
long shes going to put up the sixty-
pounder for me she wanted to do it
to-day only she hasnt got over that
banging she got the other night and
talk about fencing bob i tried the
foils with her this morning but i
couldnt touch her and i used that last
lunge you showed me too she dis-
armed me every time she said she was
going to gave me every chance and then
some bob tried to wedge in a word
but gave it up and the enthusiastic
youngster rattled on i told her what a
crackajack you are with the foils and
she said shes crazy to have a set-to
with you and take it from me you
wont have any soft snap either shes
what i call a real peach

  shes a fine little woman all right
bob answered but-

  little exclaimed jim in his sur-

prise trying to talk and whistle at the
same time

  bob laughed and explained i sup-
pose every attractive girls little with
me thats a weakness of mine but
wheres her gym  we must have
missed it the other day

  you bet we missed it and its the
only thing we did miss jim replied as
he balanced himself on the porch rail-
ing and began to swing one leg its
that little building just to the right of
the carriage house and uncle winters
hates it catching his brothers look
of surprise and interrogation he ex-
plained thats straight bob for she
told me so you see she was always
crazy to do a lot of wild stunts and
when she came here there wasnt any
chance to do anything uncle winters
made a big kick when she asked why
she couldnt have a gym he said
something about its being too much like
a circus but of course it wasnt you
know mrs winters didnt say any
more about it because you see she
knew how he felt but pretty soon she
didnt feel well at all and the doctor
made a big kick about its not being
right for her to cut out exercising
right after shed been doing so much
and right there uncle winters caved
and told her to go ahead and build
what she wanted but hes never been
inside and she says that every time he
has to pass it he shuts his eyes

  bob smiled and held his gaze on
nothing in particular presently he
said jim will you keep mum about
something

  cross mu heart bob said the boy
gripping the railing and leaning far for-
ward

  jim ive been hearing a lot about
all this assault business he began his
cheeks glowing with excitement im
going to turn detective you neednt
laugh

  i aint laughing at you bob im


detective story magazine

just glad that youre going to get busy
the youngster replied

  im going to make a bluff at it
anyway bob rejoined  know what
sheriff millar and everybody else
around here thinks but i dont believe
that big convict or the smaller one
either ever touched elsie millar or the
woodbums dog

  search me bob said the young
hero worshiper his eyes aglow with ex-
pectancy

  when all that happened they were
miles from here of course the giant
may have been the devil who waylaid
mrs winters and mrs woodburn but
im not convinced now im not going
to try to say who or whats been prowl-
ing around or flying around and chok-
ing people and dogs but- he

paused and unconsciously began to
count the number of eyelets in one of
jims shoes when he resumed his
voice was low and restrained jim
you know they found the woodburns
big bull terrier hanging up in a tree
now dont breathe a word about all this
to anybody not even to the winters
for i dont want any one to know im
on a stiil hunt

  im a mummy bob

  this is a new kind of stunt for me
this detective business and i dont want
to get in wrong at the start ive found
out for a fact that that dog of the
woodburns wouldnt have a blessed
thing to do with anybody outside the
family he was kind enough until you
tried  corner him but one day a big
husky tramp got after him and had to
go to the hospital now there wasnt
a mark on either of those convicts so
im going lo leave them out as far as
the sheriffs daughter and the dog are
concerned i dont believe they were
within a hundred miles of here at the
time but somebody else was here but
who

  jim shifted his position on the rail-
ing but made no reply he knew his

brother was reasoning aloud and he
did not break in upon his line of
thought

  im sure in my own mind that the
dog was taken off his guard that he
was lassooed and then choked to death
now you can just bank on it that the
fellow who killed that dog started to
choke the sheriffs daughter a close
observer would have noticed that bobs
excitement was on the increase jim
did you notice a fellow with a lasso
and a coil of rope over his shoulder
the other day

  jims face brightened when you
tackled that big jailbird he asked
eagerly

  shure mike replied the boy

  well i want you to find out all you
can about him only dont let on what
youre up to

  ill let you know this afternoon
said the young hopeful as he slipped
from the railing tell aunt celia to
save those cakes for me cant wait
now

  bob keyed to a high pitch spent the
balance of the morning mentally re-
viewing his self-imposed task it was
late afternoon when jim true to his
word rode up to the millars and be-
fore dismounting shouted ive got all
the dope bob

  bob in mingled consternation and
amusement cautioned him by a gesture

  ive got it straight bob jim said
in a whisper as he tiptoed up the porch
steps it wasnt any stunt at all

  howd you manage to work it so
soon 

  oh i just pumped uncle winters
foreman jim explained proceeding to
establish himself in his old position on
the railing he says that scout with
the ropes nutty but that hes safe
then i sounded mrs winters when
i told her that i thought that chap with
the rope might be the fellow whos been
doing all the choking stunts instead of
that big convict she laughed at me so
masked revenge



hard i felt like a perfect simp then
she said that hes no more dangerous
than a three-months-old kid she said
he used to be a cow-puncher but got
a bad bump one day that made him
nutty when i told her how funny he
acted with me she said that he doesnt
often say boo to anybody and that
hes been here for nearly a year ands
never done anything shady but take
it from me bob just the samemee i
dont want to meet him alone till ive
grown up as big as you are

  harding gave the well-knit young-
ster a look of admiration jim let me
give you a pointer he said impres-
sively if you dont want to get hurt
keep away from unloaded guns and
harmless lunatics

chapter xv

tiie eternal feminine

vihen bob went to the winters he
was prepared to find his hostess
the victim of morbid imaginings or
showing the traces of tears shed in se-
cret instead she moved about with an
enthusiasm and apparent lightness of
spirit that gave the lie to some of the
stories told to him by the old servant
over at the sheriffs when she took
him under her care and showed him
about the farm or lingered with him in
her gymnasium she radiated a whole-
someness of mind and heart that proved
a greater tonic to him than the drug
prescribed by his physician at no time
did she allude to the recent assaults
upon herself and others seemingly
she lived only in the present and she
charmed him by her youth and beauty
and her spirit of frank good-fellowship

  perhaps that which impressed him
most was her great strength jim was
a wiry youngster and strong for his
age and he loved a tussle the rougher
the better yet he was no match for
her she tossed him about as a cat
would a mouse and at the end of one

of their romps she caught him by the
ankles and holding him head down-
ward swung him from side to side like
a pendulum then she grasped the
sixty-pound dumb-bell and with one
hand lifted it from the floor and raised
it to a position arms-length above her
head she repeated the exercise with
hjr other arm and with the grace and
swiftness of a lioness bounded from
the gymnasium out into the open cry-
ing joyously shows over

  one evening a few days after the
beginning of his visit bob upon enter-
ing the living room was surprised to
see her standing by a table rigidly
erect her arms at her side the elbows
held slightly backward hands clenched
to see her in her present attitude gave
him a shock only a few minutes be-
fore she had left him with her face
warm with smiles and now she was
fighting for self-control her back was
toward him and in the instant of his
embarrassment he recalled the words
of the old colored woman but now
she jes takes on trios de time de ser-
bants ober t her home dey seen her
sobbin her heart oud wen she didn
know no one was roun as he
watched her a great sympathy swept
through him and he had to fight hard
against the impulse that was urging
him to go to her considering himself
an intruder he turned to go but as he
did so she heard him and as he
caught her expression he knew that
she was desperate that the spirit of
unfettered joyousness that she had
been showing him was nothing more
than clever masquerading

  well you caught me didnt you
she asked and there was no sound of
music in her voice only defiance

 i beg your pardon i-i-

  oh you neednt apologize and you
can cut out the sob stuff she said in
a hard voice then her mood sud-
denly changed im an awful fool
but you understand dont you


detective story magazine

  why i-i suppose i do

  in his confusion it would have been
impossible for him to have given a true
interpretation of his conflicting emo-
tions one thing however stood out
clearly defined and dominating his de-
sire to help her yet there was so much
he might have said so many things he
desired to express that he dared not
trust himself to speak she read him
as clearly as though he had spoken
freely and the wild strained look
faded from her face

  i know you do i feel it and its
a great comfort just now she said
with a sigh of relaxation but i didnt
use to be such a fool

  youre not a fool he protested
still holding himself any one would
be broken up whod been through what
youve been through but now that
that brutes out of the way youll have
chance to pull yourself together

  she looked at him in a frightened
way then sank into a chair and buried
her face in her hands

  bob crossed over to her he was
young and impulsive and he longed to
take her in his arms and comfort her
even as he would have held and soothed
the little child for whose sake he had
risked his life yet he could not shake
off the thought that she was the wife of
another man a man old enough to be
her grandfather it is true and who
had selfishly neglected her but still her
husband

  i wish i could help you to see things
right there isnt a blessed thing to be
afraid of now he said when he dared
trust himself to speak it hurts to see
you broken up like this

  she took one hand from her face and
touching his arm lightly very lightly
looked up and smiled in that look and
in the light fleeting touch of the hand
were conveyed a message which thrilled
him even as it warned him to hold his
grip upon his emotions

  what a great big brave generous-

hearted boy you are she declared in
a spirit of charming bewitching frank-
ness you make me feel ashamed of
myself and you give me a pile of
courage too im going to try and be-
have myself after this and yet theres
that terrible feeling which makes me
know something awfuls going to hap-
pen to mr winters

  thats only your nerves and youll
get over it just as soon as you get your
strength back i mean your nervous
strength

  i wish i could think so but i canl
it haunts me

  bob had exhausted his resources as
a comforter and looked at her in silent
sympathy

  everybody round here puts all the
blame on those convicts but they didnt
touch a soul here i know it she de-
clared once more growing excited
its something that will never be
caught when the hounds got left i
knew it could never be trailed down
the minute it gets too hard pressed it
simply dissolves but its going to show
up again you just take it from me
gosh i wish i didnt have to keep up
this second-sight stunt but i cant help
myself

  its too bad you and uncle winters
dont go away for a change bob dared
to venture

  in more ways than one she re-
plied and he saw the look of fear in
her eyes ive had my turn and be-
lieve me mr winters is going to have
his only i cant make him believe it
he was red-hot to pack up and hike out
when  was brought home all squeezed
out of shape but the minute they got
those two convicts he cooled off and
asked me to postpone my wedding
tour my wedding tour i felt like
kicking but hes set with age and i
havent always acted like an angel
toward him so i said nothing to hurt
him she was clearly distressed when
she said but its terrible to stay here
masked revenge



and know that hes going to get his

im just as sure- she heard the

sound of some one coming through the
front hall and burst into a merry laugh
bob marveled at a nature that could on
the instant change from a mood of
despondency to one of apparent mirth-
f ulness

tips disappears

among the old mans most cher-
ished possessions was a large herd
of registered shorthorns their crow-
black coats were of satiny softness and
reflected the sunlight almost with the
brilliancy of polished metal one day
a heifer calf was born distinguished
from the rest of the herd by a white
spot at the tip of each ear the old
man pronounced this marking a blem-
ish which reduced the animal to the
rank of a cull and lit only for veal in
his herd there must be one solid color
and that crow-black his wife touched
by the rare beauty of the helpless crea-
ture pleaded for its life and it became
her sole property she named it
white tips which quite naturally be-
came tips for short until she was
seven months old tips was allowed to
run with the main herd but after that
she was from time to time placed in
a large corral in which was built a com-
fortable barn in spite of these
thoughtful arrangements tips was
happiest whenever she was turned into
the herd and cunningly tried to hide
herself in the midst of her big family
whenever the attempt was made to place
her back in her corral as time went
on she became the pet of everybody on
the farm including the old man

  one morning she was not in her cor-
ral at feeding time the foreman
called to her but she did not respond
he hurried to the old man for the key
to the corral gate only to find that the
heifer was not in her barn the cir-
cumstances of her disappearance were

peculiar for the corral fence was eight
feet high and studded on its top with
sharp nails pointing menacingly up-
ward close inspection failed to show
that either the gate hinges or the lock
itself had been tampered with but
the heifer was gone and had left 
trace as to the nature of her going

  the old man listened quietly to the
news but as he toyed with a pencil
his hand shook his first comment
was i hope we find her before th
wife hears he then directed that a
careful search be made through his
herd of black shorthorns and that a
general alarm be sounded throughout
the county then having notified
sheriff millar he sent for his fore-
man

  now lets start at th beginnin he
said when was th las time y see
that heifer

  last night about eight oclock sir
when i went the rounds the foreman
answered she was lying down in the
corral just outside her barn

  eight oclock the old man re-
peated an yre sure y locked th
gate when y come away

  yes sir im sure i did mrs
winters and mr harding were out
there with me and they both saw me
do it

  bob corroborated this statement and
to make it more conclusive added
mrs winters even tried to open the
gate to make sure it was locked she
seemed awfully nervous and said that
she wished she could put the whole
place in a strong cage

  the old man started and shot bob a
look of concern

  i thought shed got over havin-

he checked himself abruptly address-
ing the foreman he said things dont
look right but how bout th key  sure
nobody got hoi of it befo y give it t
me some one might have unlocked
the-

  there wasnt any chance for that

the foreman answered emphatically
the minute i locked that gate i took
the keys right straight to you then i
turned in

  i know y give em to me all right
an i didnt go out th house las night
acknowledged the old man adding
dryly that is unless i walked in mu
sleep an ive never bin ketched doin
that

  the foreman smiled and shook his
head bob said i guess youd have
waked up looking for your crutches
but what did you do with the key
why i put it right straight in mu
pants pockit an when i went t bed
i put them pants tween th mattrissis
an slep on m he turned to the
foreman an they was thar when
you waked me up

  the foreman vouched for this state-
ment with a nod

  im wondering if anybody heard the
hounds last night jim and i didnt
hear a sound bob ventured

  i never hear nuthin at night

  i did just once one of the hounds
gave to faint barks but he didnt
really get going and i went to sleep
the foreman stated i didnt think
anything about it at the time for they
often do that you know and for no
reason that ive been able to find out
anyway i was only about half awake
they were standing near the en-
trance to the corral

  i dont see how that heifer got out
unless somebody hed a key the old
man declared

  but there werent only two keys
ever made for this lock and you had
them both maintained the foreman
that gate wasnt opened from the
time i locked it last night until i just
unlocked it

  the old man looked at the strong
eight-foot fence with its array of sharp
cruel nails and shook his head she
never jumped that fence an she didnt
go through th gate nuther

  nor through the fence either re-
joined the foreman ive overlooked
every inch of it and not a board has
been touched

  the three most reliable hounds were
then taken to the inclosure and there
released they lacked incentive and
after yawning and stretching them-
selves they kept close to the old man
at last after persistent urging they
began languidly to move about with
their noses held close to the ground
yet they made no sound other than that
of their exhalations when they were
within twenty feet from the little calf
barn they began to warm up their
languor disappeared and they became
keen for the chase the leader bayed
and dashed for the barn followed by
the others in full cry presently they
were heard from the inside but quickly
reappeared and followed the back trail
it ended where it had been picked up
twenty feet from the barn winters
encouraged them to cover every foot
of the inclosure but after a repetition
of languid aimless searching they
finally lost all interest in the fruitless
chase

  the old man glanced nervously
toward the house he was trying hard
to conceal the fact of his anxiety
then too he was fighting a losing
battle with his conscience inwardly ac-
knowledging the truth that he had only
too gladly welcomed the injury to his
ankle as an excuse for remaining at
home indefinitely at that moment he
felt a greater respect for his wifes pre-
monitions than he had believed would
ever be possible

  git all th hounds and well turn
em loose on th outside weve got t
be right smart he declared with a
sharpness that was unusual with him

  his prize pack numbering twenty-
five was soon in full cry the scent
was picked up at a point about fifty feet
from the corral and an equal distance
from the main barn it was hot and led
masked revenge



directly to the barn where it took on a
mysterious phase which defied further
pursuit for it left the ground and ran
directly up the side of the building
this fact was made clear by the be-
havior of the hounds several of the
younger springing against the barn in
an effort to climb its sides and all the
while they gave vent to their excite-
ment by incessant baying

  thats whar she went boys right
up that barn the surprised old man
said its hard t believe but i know
them hounds

  the foreman had pushed his way in
among the struggling hounds and was
standing a few feet from the building
his eyes searching the place over which
the trail was supposed to run pres-
ently he went close to the barn and
with contracted brows studied its side
then he reached up and took something
from a slightly projecting nail

  she did go up the barn and heres
the proof he exclaimed excitedly

  what y got asked the old man
striking out vigorously with one of his
crutches as he fought his way through
the restless jam of hounds

 the answer gave him a shock
some of the heifers hair

  the old man steadied himself on his
crutches and gasped up thar

  yes sir up there six feet from the
ground

 the awed old man examined the
tuft of soft black hair yas thets
tips har but i cant hardly realize it
how do y figger it out

  she was pounced on when she was
in her barn boldly asserted the fore-
man she was dragged for twenty
feet out into the corral and then she
was lifted bodily over the fence and
dropped again so you see she was
carried in all about a hundred feet
then it dragged her to the barn

and- he looked helplessly from

the old man to bob paused and then
exclaimed well i wasnt here when

it was being done and im no clairvoy-
ant but you-all saw me take her hair
from a nail six feet above the ground

  the others listened in silence and the
foreman went on she was nearly
eight months old and fatter than a
caged duck i dont know any one
around here who could climb over that
fence with five or six hundred pounds
of ripping tearing animal in his arms
there aint any three men who could
do the trick together

  but how was she toted off so slick
that th hounds didnt har nothin
asked the old man

 i dont know thats another
poser was the blunt admission shes
gone and heres a lock of her hair
thats all i know about it

  bob however believed he had ob-
served a phase of the situation that had
escaped the notice of the others a phase
that might mean a clew though
thrilled at the thought he remained
silent

  heavy of heart the old man returned
to the house and upon entering the
large living room went to a window
from where he gazed blankly out over a
part of his vast possessions he
thought that he was alone the loss of
the heifer brought freshly before him
the remembrance of his sisters oft-
repeated words of warning and the
thought of his blind selfishness in his
attitude toward his young wife they
were forces against which he could
make no defense and he sighed wear-
ily then he felt the gentle pressure
of two soft hands against his temples
and he turned to look into the beautiful
eyes of his wife he saw that she
was smiling and in the stress of his
anxiety and contrition he knew that
her cheerfulness had made the task just
before him the harder but the time
had come for her to hear of the fate of
her pet

  suthn bads happnd ive got t
tell y but i- he faltered and
i

detective story magazine

placed a trembling hand reverently on
her arm

  she went to his rescue yes i
know i heard the hounds and saw
you-all coming from the corral then
i knew she said softly im sorry
awfuily sorry but you mustnt worry
on my account you mustnt youve
always been so good to me so good
and ive shown so little appreciation
ive just accepted it all but im
ashamed of the way i acted the other
day im ashamed but then i was
frightened im always frightened
but im trying to live it down im go-
ing to live it down no matter what

happens but if-if- she was

on the verge of breaking but gripped
herself in time to prevent a scene ive
been so selfish but i didnt realize it
your ankle is on the bum and i know
you have so much business worry

  she was very beautiful at that mo-
ment the old man ooked at her half
in awe i reckn ive bin th selfish one
wife he said brokenly but i didnt
reelize it but yew jes wait a leetle
longer an well go t new yoke

  youre a dear ill wait just as
long as you wish we mustnt think of
going away until your ankles all well
she replied with a smile that warmed
him she was looking through the win-
dow and her gaze chanced to focus
upon the large barn just as the fore-
man and bob were coming out there
was conviction in her tone when she
added then im not so crazy to go
anyway

  he stared at her in amazement y
dont want to quit this ol home arter
all he asked i reckn fer good an
all i dont understan th wimmin

  she answered him with a merry win-
some laugh and ran lightly from the
room

  he had not recovered from his sur-
prise when bob entered and asked do
you know much about the hands on this
place of course i know all about the

foreman but ive only passed the time
of day with the others

  reckn i do answered the old man
without hesitation they is all a good
lot of boys thars one onm corbin
what drinks but he only does that
wunst in a while an he never comes
back till he gits sober thar aint none
of m that im spicious of no th
hans is honest

  bob did not pursue the subject and
presently went to his room he wanted
to think and reason without interrup-
tion later in the morning he paid an-
other visit to the corral and directly
stole away in his car

chapter xvii

man or beast

hthe next three or four days were
busy ones for bob following his
own plan of investigation he spent the
greater part of the time touring the
country within a radius of fifteen miles
suspecting everybody in general and no
one in particular he endeavored to
reach his early conclusions by a pains-
taking process of elimination on the
fourth day of his run he returned late
in the afternoon with the comforting
belief that he had made progress he
had left his car in the shed which had
been given over to his use and was
passing the large barn when he met the
foreman

  heifer turned up yet bob asked
no and i guess she wont the
foreman answered he seemed on the
point of saying more but hesitated
then lowering his voice and glancing
cautiously about he said mr hard-
ing theres something on my mind i
want to get rid of ive been keeping
it dark for a long time but something
ought to be done i want your advice
i havent told anybody but its about
the old man

  you mean uncle winters

  yes hes a sleep walker
masked revenge



  bob was spcechless

  ive seen him doing that more times
than i can count and he doesnt know
the first thing about it the foreman
declared ive sounded him the next
day right after seeing him prowling
round but he thinks he was in bed all
night ive been afraid to wake him
up or to tell him for hes getting along
in years you know besides hes had a
heap of worry lately

  but hes lame what about his
crutches

  oh he always has them and he uses
them just as slick as when hes wide
awake ive been afraid to tell mrs
winters you know how unstrung she
is just now ive kept dark as long as
i can and i dont know whether ive
been doing the right thing or not
when was the last time you saw
him

  two nights ago and i wont forget
it either he looked into my room i
never used to lock the door but i do
now and i got a good look at him
the moon was shining right on his
face and any one could tell he was way
off

  what did he do

  nothing but just stare all about
then he went out and i put on my
rubber boots and an ulster and sneaked
out after him i found him in the car-
riage house and saw him unlock the
harness-room door and look at a new
harness that had just come then he
locked up again and made a bee line for
the house sometimes hed unlock one
building sometimes another and he
finally got on my nerves

  it looks pretty bad bob said if
i were you id get hold of doctor
eastman and tell him the whole thing
well i feel easier anyway if id
done as you say long ago i guess that
heiferd have been in her corral right
now

  bob fought back an exclamation and
answered lightly its a bad guess all

right but were a bunch of bad guessers
when it comes to getting anywhere
after exchanging a few common-
places bob left him and hunted up jim
to whom he repeated the conversation

  but uncle winters never ran off
with their heifer bob the youngster
declared heatedly any boob would
know that he couldnt with that punk
ankle of his

  thats right jim bob answered
he couldnt have done it and he
wouldnt if he could so he didnt
but im sorry the foremans got that
idea in his head he thought for a
moment then said weve got to
knock it out of him before he really
believes it

  the next forenoon bob received a
registered letter the contents of which
drove him into a whirl of excitement
twice he read it then hurriedly sought
his brother he found him carefully
grooming the horse that had been re-
served for the boys use having sat-
isfied himself that no one was within
hearing yet controlling his voice which
he knew was betraying his excitement
he said jim weve won weve
cleared up all this funny business no
doubt about it

  bob

  im just as sure as i am that i see
you standing there with your mouth
like a gasping fish and your eyes as big
as two full moons popping out of your
head

  oh bob bob exclaimed the boy
rushing to his brother and grasping his
arm i guess your eyes would pop
out if anybodyd sprung that on you
but i dont see how you did it

  i thought it all out the night after
the heifer disappeared i didnt sleep
a wink that night i just went over
every blessed thing thats happened
since the woodburn kid got scared at
last things began to shape up there
was only one break in the chain and
to-day i got the missing link 


detective story magazine

  jim overjoyed leaned against his
horse and stared at his brother in
amazement bob youre great he
said his expressive young face glowing
with pride and admiration i want to
ask a billion questions but dont know
where to start in but i would like to
know where that heifer went to if
youve found out

 no i havent bob answered
frankly yet with a shade of disappoint-
ment in his tone but i believe i
know how she was got out of the cor-
ral when we prove that we will

know-

  but it wasnt uncle winters was

it that foreman-

  jims sentence ended abruptly cut
short by the sound of a swiftly running
horse turning they saw mrs winters
riding toward them she had just en-
tered the grounds from the main high-
way and was urging breeze to the limit
of his speed

  christmas hows that for riding
bob said in genuine admiration

  get the hounds get the hounds
exclaimed the girl ive seen him
ive seen him

  by this time she had reached the
stable and with a slight but dextrous
tightening of the reins together with a
backward movement of her body she
had brought her horse to his haunches
four of the hands who had watched
her coming rushed up to hear her
story

  quick george she said to one of
them ring the call bell ring it
hard

  whats the matter bob asked
the gorilla she answered and her
voice was almost a scream

  everybody echoed  the gorilla 
the great call bell suddenly sounded
loud and ominously the hands came
rushing from every direction

  get the horses and the hounds she
commanded we can run him down
if we start now

  she threw herself from her saddle
and glanced at the saddle girth which
had become dangerously loose the act
was more instinctive than voluntary

  never mind about that bob called
as he saw her about to tighten the girth
pile into my car i can take you and
three of the hounds and uncle winters
can come along too if he isnt afraid
to risk it whered you see that brute
he was in that tree where i got
nabbed the other night she replied i
saw him just as he dropped into the
road there wasnt any mistaking him
i wasnt over a hundred yards from
him but that was near enough

  they were now standing by bobs
car already the engine was in mo-
tion one of the hands rushed ap with
three hounds on a leash four men
armed with rifles and well mounted
were dashing for the main highway
with them were the other hounds
the old man could not be persuaded to
enter the automobile and the two young
people with the three selected hounds
were soon scorching for the big tree
with the overhanging branch they
passed the mounted men when about a
mile from the farm and bob had the
road to himself

  how big was he he asked speak-
ing for the first time

  i dont know he was taller than i
am perhaps six feet you see i was
too far away to tell much about him
but i could tell that he was massive
she clutched bobs arm lightly as she
said he didnt stand up straight but
bent over and twice he went ahead

without touching the ground he-

  you mean that he was flying

  no not really flying for he didnt
have any wings but im sure that
twice he just floated through the air
just as he must have done the night
he had me

  then hes something more than just
plain gorilla bob declared

  thats why i feel so frightened i
masked revenge



mean that lies something more than an
animal something that doesnt belong
here at all she tried to explain all the
while tightening her grip on bobs arm
no real animal could move as he
does

  bob did not argue the point and they
reached the tree ahead of the mounted
men and found the scent strong but
short they lost it at a tree near the
brook a significant phase of this brief
trail was the fact that twice the hounds
lost the scent and again picked it up
again twenty-five or thirty feet from
the spot where is disappeared

  he must have wings after all sure
you didnt make them out bob asked
lightly almost facetiously

  she did not respond in the same
spirit im sure he didnt have any
wings she answered and the old look
of fear crept into her face theres
something terrible in all this i know
he isnt real that he doesnt actually
exist as other animals do if he did
he simply couldnt disappear as he
does

  but he leaves a scent he reasoned
yes but thats only a trick to make
us think hes real but he isnt mr
harding he isnt

  the look of amusement had left
bobs face its a terrible mess mrs
winters and i only hope that well land
him before he has chance to harm
uncle winters he said gravely and
i want you to shake off that feeling
about his not being real for hes just
as much flesh and blood as we are

  i wish i could make myself feel as
you do but i cant and so far my fears
have come true she argued then
softly i dont know what i-what
mr winters and i would have done
without you

  i say bob said jim as he joined
them ill just bet that that scout with
the ropes at the bottom of this stunt

he just sneaks out and-

  but not this time sonny the fore-
  f-ds

man broke in he asked me for work
this morning and i set him to splitting
wood he hasnt been off the place
since

chapter xviii

jarden gets busy

phere followed a state-of excite-
ment bordering on panic those
whose interests necessitated daily trips
from home arranged to go in pairs
but rarely ever alone the country
school was closed neither by night
nor by day did any one feel safe it
mattered not whether the creature were
in reality a beast or some elusive mani-
festation of the supernatural his pres-
ence was a menace the news that
jarden head of the states detective
force a man famous for his work
among criminals was on the case gave
only a moments relief because he
failed utterly to get any result and
results were what the frightened peo-
ple needed this unhappy state of af-
fairs continued for nearly a week and
came to a sudden ending with the arrest
of the man with the rope

  he quietly declared his innocence
then refused to speak he even re-
jected all offers of friendly counsel
emphasizing his determined attitude by
turning his back upon his visitor and sit-
ting with arms folded

  howd you happen to nab him
bob asked the sheriff he never
climbed out of the corral with that
heifer in his arms

  jardens orders

  bob deep in his own thoughts made
no rejoinder

  weve had our eyes on him for some
time sheriff millar explained jar-
den says he aint the half-wit hes sup-
posed to be and i guess that if we got
a look at his brains wed find the colors
all right i dont feel sure about his
getting away with that heifer but were
dead sure he killed woodburns dog
jarden says hes got him on some other


detective story magazine

  things and hes going to pump him so
dry hell wither up

  but he wont talk bob objected

  i know he hasnt yet but wait until
jarden gets after him the sheriff re-
plied grimly youll hear him all over
the state

  bob mentally speculating as to the
nature of those other things with
which jarden claimed the prisoner was
connected made no reply but the
sheriffs next statement forced an ex-
clamation from him yes hell talk
all right he asserted with conviction
but id like to have somebody tell me
what jardens got on butler

  what butler winters foreman
bob asked

  sure the old mans foreman
  but whats he been up to

  search me i never suspected him
sheriff millar answered and the look
of perplexity in his face was genuine
jarden isnt telling me any more than
hes compelled to but thats jarden
its the way he treats every one whos
working under him all he told me
was that the fellow whom we jugged
and the foreman have been seen to-
gether and that they ought to be to-
gether right now

  but wheres the heifer has jar-
den told you that bob asked and as
he spoke he could not hide his sarcasm

  he says shes been killed and either
eaten or buried he hesitated as if in
doubt before he continued i say
bob jardens put some queer ideas into
my head now im not saying that i
agree with him but then you never can
tell heres the part i dont like you
know the old man hasnt been any too
rugged lately and shes in no sort of
mind to get any more shocks we-all
know that but jardens heart would
freeze cream i never knew such a
cold cuss all he ever thinks about is
getting his man he dont care who
he is and he dont care whose feelings
he hurts when he lands him hes got

  brains all right but he hasnt got any
more heart than a machine

  bob could feel his heart being
pressed by the weight of a new-born
and intangible fear i guess youre
right but what are you driving at he
demanded in the stress of his anxiety

  jarden aint putting me wise to
everything hes found out ive done a
lot of good work for him but i know
that hes doing a lot himself that hes
laying low about at any rate he
seems to feel pretty sure of his
grounds now heres what im com-
ing to and i dont like it the sheriff
drew nearer and said with lowered
voice he says that weve got to keep
our eyes on the old man

  well we havent bob declared
hotly

  and to think that fm paying that
detective with the old mans money
and heres something else have you
heard that the old mans been seen
prowling round at night

  yes ive heard something about his
walking in his sleep bob admitted re-
luctantly

  sos jarden and he has an ugly way
of hinting that the old man aint asleep
now whatd you know about that
rotten bob declared in disgust
for the love of pete get rid of jarden
he makes me sick

  sheriff millar shook his head and
forced a sickly smile

  get rid of him-jarden he asked
with a low uneasy chuckle its too
late if i was to fire him hed still fol-
low the scent we cant get rid of him
hes gone into this case for all hes
worth you see he believes that hes
struck the trail of a gang hes been
after for years just where he figures
that the old man comes in i cant guess
for the life of me

  nor anybody else

  when i told him that the old man
would be satisfied to let the case drop
with the arrest of the fellow with the
masked revenge



rope he said nothing doing he says
that if im not satisfied with him i can
get some one else but that hell stick
on his own account you see we cant
shake him

  a faint smile lurked about bobs
lips perhaps hes got you and me
shadowed who knows he asked
dryly if he keeps on hell have every-
body round here locked up i believe
hes bluffing and it looks to me as if
hes trying to peek through the keyhole
with both eyes well let him go ahead
uncle winters can show a clean slate
thats all very true bob and it
sounds well but it wont work out the
way we want it to jardens no four-
flusher and take it from me he aint
bluffing of course he aint got any-
thing on the old man but he certainly
can cause him and her a lot of trouble
just when theyll have to have a let-up
or go dippy sheriff millars eyes nar-
rowed and there was a note of cau-
tiousness in his voice when he added
bob has it ever occurred to you that
she may be just a little off you see
shes got herself pretty well keyed up
feeling things that are going to hap-
pen

  mrs winters out of her head
bob exclaimed with a laugh that rang
true i dont care what she feels shes
got more brains than the rest of us put
together

  i knew youd say that about her
the sheriff declared lightly yet in a
manner which carried no offense i
dont say that shes anything like being
insane but i do believe that shes got
herself so worked up that she doesnt
see what she thinks she does i dont
believe she really saw a gorilla at all
what about the hounds bob
asked you couldnt fool them and
they certainly hit a hot trail

  oh she saw something all right
which she distorted into a gorilla
you may be right he admitted
but just at that moment he was not

seriously interested in the subject of
the gorilla his thoughts were occu-
pied with a more vital question were
he and jarden secretly following the
same line of reasoning in the establish-
ing of an actual clew

  alarmed and depressed he sought
his brother to whom he unburdened
himself jim was an attentive and sym-
pathetic listener and the freshly re-
vealed complications in no sense modi-
fied his belief in his big brothers ability
to unravel the tangle

  but i think jardens caught that
chap with the rope with the goods on
dont you think so bob asked the
boy

  not unless jardens got hold of
something that ive missed and ive in-
vestigated every square foot in this
county bob answered then to the
youngsters delight he gave his reasons
for taking issue with the detective
the strongest evidence against your
friend with the rope is the fact that
he was once treed by woodburns bull
terrier he told a gossiping old woman
that he was going to kill the dog not
long after that the dog was found
strangled and the old woman swears
that she saw the fellow near wood-
burns home that evening thats the
only evidence against him and-

  but thats real proof bob i dont
see what more you want

  but there is something more so you
just keep still ive found out that the
old woman had it in for him for a long
time i dont know what the troubles
about but shes been waiting for a
chance to get even and she got it
so dont you take any too much stock
in her now for point number two
at the time when sheriff millars
daughter was waylaid and woodburns
dog was killed the fellow with the rope
was seen near birdsville by three men
two are pretty sure about it and one
is ready to swear to it now jim a
man cant be in two places at the same


detective story magazine

time so you can draw your own con-
clusions as to the justice in nabbing the
fellow its true that he was on hand
at the time when they were trying to
run down whatever it was that pounced
on the sheriffs daughter but that was
long enough after the time of the as-
sault for him to have got back from
birdsville ive got an idea that jarden
made that arrest to keep everybody
good-natured people were getting too
hot for him not to do something to
show that he wasnt asleep

  you just bet thats why he jugged
that scout declared jim now wholly
convinced that jarden did not catch his
man with the goods on

 bob made no response he was
thinking of sheriff millars description
of jarden i wish i knew how much
jarden actually knows he simply
must be sidetracked

  youre on the right lay bob so
why dont you strike now jim asked
in an outburst of his native enthusiasm
dont give jarden a chance to work
any of his funny business id pile
right in now bob-now

  bob smiled in spite of his distress of
mind thats just what id like to
do but this case is too ticklish to allow
of any bungling i believe im on the
right track i was sure of it the other

day but if im not- he did not

finish the sentence circumstantial
evidence has hung more than one inno-
cent man and thats all ive got now
sometimes i feel that jarden and i are
working along the sam - line only hes
seven laps ahead and still gaining we
cant afford to let him strike first lets
run out to brentonville its our only
hope now

  a few minutes later they left the
farm in bobs car the sun had al-
ready set when they returned from
their run

  i guess old jarden didnt gain any
laps this afternoon bob jim said in
delight as he stepped from the dust-

covered car when do you think you
are going to-

  bob glanced about in alarm dont
talk out here he said and dont
look so blamed pleased with the world
either we dont know who may be
eying us this very minute he had
been speaking very softly and he low-
ered his voice when he said im going
to act to-morrow morning

  the coming of the old man caused a
sudden change in the conversation as
bob looked at him he could feel his
heart throbbing in his throat then he
steeled himself for his ordeal of the
morrow

chapter xix
at the foot of his bed

that night the old man went to his
room long after the others had
retired though tired in mind and
body and greatly in need of sleep he
did not dare to close his eyes he was
afraid to go to sleep afraid lest he
should suddenly open his eyes and find
himself out in the cold night air or
in one of the several outbuildings on
his farm he fought against sleep as
he would have fought against a power-
ful drug which robbing him of his
guiding conscience would have forced
him all unconsciously to the commit-
ment of acts traceable only to the in-
sane

  only the night before he had awak-
ened to discover that he was in the
gymnasium in the act of opening or
attempting to open one of the lockers
the key to which was in his wifes pos-
session he was fully dressed and on
the floor by his side were his crutches
he did not remember dressing in fact
he had no recollection of having left
his bed but he was positive that he
had undressed and gone to bed and
that just before putting out the light
he had looked at the clock

that last act was fixed in his mem-
ory then he had passed into dream-
masked revenge



less sleep from which he had awak-
ened to find himself in the hated gym-
nasium he could not tell how long he
had been there and at first he tried to
convince himself that he was dreaming
the situation was uncanny the real-
ization that he had quite unconsciously
entered a building the interior of which
he had vowed never to see that he had
moved and acted like an automaton
unmanned him and he began to shake
like one taken with a chill when he
had last seen the candle which he was
now holding it was on the little table
by the side of his bed and he wondered
where he was when he relighted it
had its rays betrayed him the
thought brought him to his senses he
saw that the window shades were
raised and the discovery added to his
discomfiture he hastily picked up his
crutches and blew out the light he
could only hope that he had not been
seen for he was proud and the thought
of discovery was humiliating a feel-
ing akin to shame swept over him for
it was just a few days ago when he
had boasted that he never walked in his
sleep

  putting the candle into his coat
pocket he groped his way to the door
and cautiously peered out he had no
idea of the hour but he hoped that it
was still too early for the hands to be-
gin their first duties of the day they
were early risers those sturdy toilers
of the soil but there was no light in
any of their rooms and he knew they
were still sleeping he felt relieved
he softly closed the door fearful that
its faintest sound might reach the ear
of some light sleeper or rouse the
hounds once more he glanced about
then stole half crouching through the
yard in his efforts to crouch he
spread his crutches wide apart and
losing his feeble balance he fell for-
tunately his ankle suffered no ill ef-
fects and readjusting his crutches he
went the rest of the way boldly erect

but the exertion was severe and he
was breathing hard when he reached
his room he did not undress but
throwing himself upon his bed he drew
the comforter over himself and unable
to sleep lived out the balance of a mis-
erable night

  it was not until the day was well ad-
vanced that he felt sure that he alone
held his secret and the thought was
comforting but now as he lay in bed
he was tormented by the fear that he
might within a few hours repeat his
act of the night before for a long
time he lay and tossed resolved not to
sleep then he dreamed

  he was lost in a dense forest the
air was dry and hot and was driven
against him by a mighty wind he
could hear it roaring as it battled with
the defiant sky-reaching pines then
he himself was the wind and he was
filled with glee as he saw all things
bending and breaking under his force
suddenly a great cliff loomed he
knew he could not shatter it and he
knew that so great was his speed he
could not stop he was doomed then
he awoke with a jerk and realized that
the roaring of the gale was the sound
of his own labored breathing once
more he drifted off into unpleasant
dreams again to awaken with a start
then he slept the sleep of the ex-
hausted he no longer dreamed but
he awoke with an unaccountable feeling
of oppression he wondered why he
should have awakened at all from such
a quiet sleep within the house was
unbroken silence while from the out-
side starlit world there came no sound

  his room faced the east and he
looked toward the window in the hope
of seeing the first faint pink tinge of
the coming day as he did so he
caught his breath with a gasp and held
it while his heart seemed suddenly to
beat trembling in every part he
slowly raised himself to one elbow and
looked as yet he had not breathed

  standing directly before the open
window its huge black form sil-
houetted against the soft uncertain
light of the sky was an object it
might have been a man then again it
might have been an animal it was
impossible to distinguish which pres-
ently it moved

  the old man sank swiftly softly to
his pillow and pressed one shaking
hand over his mouth and nose lest the
sound of his breathing should be heard
the thing had turned and was stand-
ing with one massive arm reaching out
as if about to feel its way through the
gloom of the room suddenly it
crouched until only its head and shoul-
ders could be seen and began stealth-
ily noiselessly to creep toward the bed
it reached the foot and for a moment
remained motionless

  the old man resisted a mad impulse
to shout for help then with what
little presence of mind he still retained
he told himself that with one ankle
crippled and his revolver in his bureau
drawer his safest plan was for him
to lie still and feign sleep

  on the table by his bed were his
watch and several bills besides numer-
ous pieces of silver these would be
quickly discovered and appropriated
and then his guest would leave him to
commit other robberies in the house
yes he would lie still and feign sleep
at the right time he would get his re-
volver and give the alarm he was ly-
ing on his right side with his legs
partly drawn up the left leg extended
a little beyond the right and he resisted
an impulse to draw both of his knees
to his chest to have done so would
have afforded him a sense of relief
he wanted to draw the bedclothes over
his head they seemed just then his
only means of protection but he did
not stir

  he saw the thing sink slowly from
sight and knew it was crouching
something touched his left foot and

rested there then it moved and he
felt the pressure of fingers pass lightly
about his ankle and steal softly to his
knee there the hand rested and
gently slowly moved its fingers again
the old man wanted to cry out yet he
did not stir

  the hand left his knee and began
slowly to work its way up his thigh
after an age it reached the hip and
began to feel about the bedclothes and
all the while the thing had remained out
of sight then stealthily noiselessly
appeared the head the broad shoulders
the huge black body a hound barked
and the thing withdrew its hand and
sank out of sight its movements were
as silent as the passing of clouds

  the old man could control his breath-
ing no longer his breath forced its
way through his restraining fingers
loud and rasping he tried to cover
the fact of his distress by pretending
to snore but the attempt was a failure
it was more like a stifled groan the
barking of the hound ceased

  once more the thing loomed by the
bed and leaned slightly over and again
lightly placed its hand upon the old
mans hip but not to remain there
slowly the thing drew so close that the
old man could hear it breathe pres-
ently it moved a hand across the little
table brushing thew atch and the silver
to the floor next it quietly pushed the
table brushing the watch and the silver
close that its breath touched the face
of the old man then the hand reached
the shoulder and rested there the old
man wanted to draw away from that
hand yet he knew that he must lie
perfectly still a sense of suffocation
overcame him and involuntarily he
slowly drew his knees to his chest but
he knew that on no account must he
again stir holding himself in ago-
nized restraint he dug his fingers into
the bedclothes yet he knew also that
he had reached the limit of self-con-
trol that he had gone beyond it he
masked revenge



felt that he must cry out he knew he
was going to cry out and he also
knew what that outcry would cost him
but the silent methodical creeping
movements of the thing had shattered
his nerves and destroyed the splendid
power of his will

  slowly the thing drew itself erect
and moving back contemplated his in-
tended victim at that moment the old
man knew that he was not at the mercy
of anything human his observation
was brief

 the thing crouched and glided
toward the bed

  the old man had passed the point of
human endurance in the unbearable
agony of his horror and despair he

suddenly thrust out his legs with great
force and jerked his body to an upright
position his eyes were wild and glar-
ing his arms were raised in an atti-
tude of defense help he screamed
bob bob

  he saw the huge black form hurling
itself upon him and the sound of his
hoarse terrified utterance was instantly
stifled by a rough hand placed over his
mouth at the same instant another
powerful hand grasped his slender
throat and he was forced to his pillow
in his feeble yet frantic efforts to tear
himself free he gripped an arm it
was covered with long coarse hair
then consciousness was lost in merci-
ful oblivion

child tried for murder

an eleven-year-old boy who recently stood trial for murder in knox indiana
was released under a ten-thousand-dollar bond when the jury was unable
to reach an agreement in regard to his responsibility for his chums death

    the fatality occurred on thanksgiving day  cecil burkett eleven-
year-old son of michael burkett a dredge hand and one of six children was
playing in an adjoining yard a few miles from knox with his brother alfred
benny slavin son of a clothing merchant bennys six-year-old sister clara
pearl heinline another little girl of the village and one or two other children
cecil had received a -caliber rifle for a birthday present he carried it as
he played with his companions

    suddenly benny slavin fell to the ground screaming and the children scat-
tered shouting benny is shot

    when several women who had seen this affair from a distance ran to the
injured boy he was unconscious bleeding from a wound near the heart he
was taken to the hospital at winamac where he died the next day

     cecil burkett tells the story in this way

    frederick and i were cleaning out the martin house we were taking out
straw that sparrows had carried into it my rifle was leaning against the side
of the house i was taking some of the straw into my house to burn it

    i had not seen benny and i could not see the gun from where i was
walking i heard a shot and a yell i dropped the straw and ran around the
corner of the house benny was running and the gun was on the ground 
picked up the gun and took it and the straw into the house i did not know
benny was shot i think benny picked up the gun and was dragging it away
when the trigger got caught in some weeds and fired it i didnt have any
quarrel with benny

    bennys parents say that benny twice said just before he died mother
cecil burkett shot me

time

iuddenly and painfully
macumbers strong fingers
closed on my elbow they
applied the brakes just in
another step would have taken
me into the path of a motor car scoot-
ing up the avenue at a clip that would
have been excessive on a country road

  there was a look in the great ones
eyes that  attributed to solicitude as
he chided

  eyes wide open on busy streets lad
its a duty you owe to your bad heart
no less than the leg the machine gun
peppered

  my eyes were open i protested
they scarcely could be expected to
mark the course of a projectile
macumber grinned quizzically
were they now then maybe you
could give me an accurate description
that could be used to halt the offend-
ing machine farther on suppose id
been hit by it say

  well it was a large machine-prob-
ably seven passenger and it was red

and-v

  and queried macumber youve
described the color and size wonder-
fully youre wrong in only two par-
ticulars and

  and the driver probably might be
identified through a strong odor of syn-
thetic gin i finished

 macumbers grin broadened he
nodded amused approval of the deduc-
tion we had walked a block before he
spoke again

  three years and more since weve
been together lad he mused you
in the war and not letting me hear a
word of you but through the casualty
list

  its scarce three years since ive
seen you though maestro  i chuckled
i have the advantage not more than
two years ago i was one of three thou-
sand fellows who enjoyed a very re-
markable exposition of magic not so
far behind the front id twisted an
ankle getting there for id seen the
great macumber billed

  you didnt hail me

  not in the midst of the illusions
seeing them from in front at last after
long familiarity back stage was too big
a treat and afterward the entertain-
ment people were too swift getting you
away

  magic said macumber gravely
was but one of my war activities ill
have some yarns to spin you by-the-by
of misdirection as applied to the espio-
nage industry

  still the detective maestro

  still the earnest student of applied
misdirection whats magic whether
stage or criminal commands my atten-
tion always

  the great one paused to light his
stubby pipe

  crime he orated as we strode
ahead again has fallen into low estate
these days there seems no more cun-
ning in the underworld the murderer
leaves awkward boot prints great
when the family were away



robberies are interesting only in the
volume of their proceeds methods
employed are too simple and direct
theres no subtlety

  i wagged my head in sympathy with
the great ones mood crime was his
hobby-the crime in a million in which
the magicians own art of misdirection
might be employed to take the investi-
gation dashing off on false trails il-
legalities of the sort macumber joyously
hailed as my very particular kind had
been few enough five years ago now
none

  none worth while echoed macum-
ber the book of crime has become a
primer at this moment something that
might be interesting is in prospect-but
i fear it wont be

  you have premonitions

  strong premonitions said macum-
ber blowing twin smoke clouds from
the corners of his mouth i shall at
least attempt in the fashion of the mas-
terful deductionists to make the immi-
nent thing interesting for you
lie grinned down at me cheerfully
then with the burr creeping into his
voice to tell me that some faint excite-
ment stirred within him he went on
suppose i were to tell you that
around the next corner to the right
adventure awaited us

  and suppose  was to say that this
adventure should have for its scene a
four-story brownstone house

  you become almost specific

  a beginning lad i will add posi-
tively that the adventure has connection
with crime-and that the cr-rime will be
mur-r-der

  splendid i cried is that all now
to be revealed

  all but the touch the fillip said
the great one permit me to haz-
ar-r-d that we shall be invited into the
affair by a tall but undistinguished man
with r-red hair and mustache who will
be missing the little finger-r from his
left hand

  we were turning the corner as ma-
cumber finished his odd peroration
halfway down the old-fashioned block
i noted with a thrill a group of idlers
had collected

  it looks like score one i said

  get out the pad and pencil lad
snapped macumber i was not entirely
in jest the scor-r-re will be mount-
ing r-rapidly

  it did presently we were standing
with a grocers driver and his helper
a messenger boy a few housemaids
and a half dozen casuals in front of a
residence that was of four stories
brownstone faced at the foot of the
tall stoop a policeman stood guard

  what is it asked macumber of
the policeman

  my ears had just caught the mans
unexpectedly civil answer-murder
-when the door above was jerked open
violently from within

  a tall man came forth and stood si-
lent for an instant at the top of the
steps his hair and his mustache were
a vivid red for all his air of author-
ity he was not a person one would have
called distinguished

  the wires here have been cut offi-
cer he bellowed telephone head-
quarters ill not be back for sivral
hours

  the red ones eye caught the great
ones

  come in if you wish profissor he
called hospitably itll hardly be one
of thim misapplication cases of yours
but ye can look

  he waved us a welcome wth a hairy
hand it was his left-aivj the little
finger most conspicuously was missing

  the body of an elderly man clad in
pajamas and house slippers lay
sprawled in the entrance hall the man
was on his baalc the stiffened fingers
of his right hand suggested their re-

cent grip on the revolver which a de-
tective was examining

  lieutenant michael clancy acknowl-
edged my introduction to him with an
abstracted nod

  warren fleming he was bulletin-
ing to macumber big lawyer in his
way but one of the kind ye hear little
of stood well with old families will
cases mostly thoroughly reliable and
got good pay for it proud sort of man
his own family dates back to when
there was guns at the battery

  looks like he wras game died with
boots on pretty near slippers on any-
how

  burglars queried macumber
clancys tone bespoke his disgust at
the suggestion of the obvious

  kidnapers would ye think  which-
ever i would be surprised but what
fleming punctured one of em theres
stains over there by the door and more
spots on the front steps fleming got
five shots out of his own gun before
they finished him not bad for an old
man with a reputation for bein quiet
and conservative they hit him twice
once in the arm then in the heart
that settled it

  how about the servants

  not a soul in the place but old flem-
ing himself explained clancy whole
family moved out on long island to
the summer place last month servants
went along nobody living on the block
now but a few caretakers fleming
didnt have any just let the house
stand

  family know

  yep i phoned from headquarters
when i got the flash wife and older
daughter have a doctor with em now
other daughters on the way in going
to be married next month they tell me
how did fleming happen to be in
town with the rest in the country
dunno yet

  clancy led macumber toward a rear

room uninvited but curious i fol-
lowed

  i was talking to the man that dis-
covered the crime when you come along
profissor hes a sort of general care-
taker for a dozen houses along the row
looks in once or twice a day ill get
the rest of his statement

  proceed said macumber cheer-
fully ill be with you when ive tied
my shoe this understand is a subter-
fuge of the high-class private investi-
gator i wish to examine the r-rugs
carefully for the ash of the made-to-
order cigarette which the cr-r-riminal
smoked

  humph  grunted clancy beyond
doubt yell find a stub with the name
and address lettered on it in gold dis-
toorb nothing ye see though or ill be
lockin ye up for malicious mischief

  it was banter on both sides but the
great one did remain in the hall as
the red one returned to the caretaker
and he did appear to make at least a
cursory inspection he walked slowly
back toward the detective who still was
minutely examining warren flemings
revolver

  is the key to the mystery there
asked macumber lightly

  the plain-clothes man favored him
with a blank stare the magician was
a stranger to him recommended only
by the acquaintance of his superior

  is it a mystery mister he re-
torted

  then the mans voice sharpened

  look out there he called thats
somethin were not touchin ourselves
till the medical examiner comes

  macumbers gaze was not concen-
trated on the ground his foot had
stirred -the dead mans extended left
arm

  the great one stooped with an apol-
ogy and moved back the arm to its
original position

  medical examiners are fussy con-
cer-r-ning such things said he but
when the family were away



accept my asur-rance no harms done
what does the revolver-r tell you
the detective slipped the weapon into
his pocket

  its an automatic ejector with six
chambers he said one cartridge is
left in it the lieutenants got the five
other shells maybe youd better in-
quire of him if you want the whole
story

  no other shells found

  nope but ail guns aint automatic
ejectors are they asked the detective
and turned a broad back on us

  i hesitated in doubt whether macum-
ber would turn toward the door which
led to the stoop and the street or that
behind which clancy was pursuing his
questioning of the caretaker the great
one not hesitating started tor the rear

  are you developing an interest in
ordinary burglars i asked with a
smile

  macumbers response was accompan-
ied by no return smile

  havent you the splendid mind to
be so quickly asur-red they were or-
r-dinary burglars

  he strode swiftly and softly into the
rear room after the ghost of a knock
and dropped into a chair at clancys
side

  clancy was a painstaking interroga-
tor he had the policemans habit-an
excellent one macumber has often as-
serted though lacking the patience for
it himself-of covering the same ground
many times thus though he had had
a considerable session with the witness
in hand we missed none of the essen-
tials of his story

  the man a blond giant was wrapped
in super-scandinavian melancholy

  i find the body and know nothing
more he reiterated every day be-
fore lunch i am hired to look into the
house i have a key yesterday it was
all right to-day when i open the door
i see mr fleming dead in the hall

  how long did you stay in the house
after you saw the body  asked clancy

  not one second i can tell you i
ran to the corner and hollered

  you heard shots last night eh
why didnt you holler then

  lots others heard the noise too my
wife and swanson at no  and sev-
eral we all thought it was automobile
back fire every night pretty near we
heard something like it there was
no yelling or anything just the bangs
how many bangs

  i wasnt counting them maybe six
maybe eight maybe ten

  what time was that

  i didnt look it was getting light
out

  about half past three

  maybe

  that was the substance of it
clancy looking weary turned to ma-
cumber

  all told there were eleven shots
fired he said unless some of em dis-
appeared altogether it dont make any
particular difference but everythings
got to be accounted for we may not
always be what yed call brilliant at
headquarters profissor but were thor-
ough

  clancy lit a cigar glared indignantly
at the uninformative caretaker and re-
sumed 

  fleming was asleep upstairs when
the burglars got in the business that
kept him in town overnight may have
had some bearing on the burglary
well hear of that later anyway
fleming wakes up and hears somebody
downstairs they was probably in the
next room where he had a kind of of-
fice step in ill show ye

  clancy threw open a sliding door
revealing a dimly lighted and disordered
room between what had been known
when the residence was built as the
front parlor and back parlor

  in one corner of this room stood an
old-fashioned roll-top desk with cover


detective story magazine

up next to the desk was a small safe
its steel door ajar

  the safe is what is called nowadays
the petermans delight  said clancy
with sarcasm any one that could
open a childs bank would have no diffi-
culty with it forty years ago burglars
might have drilled and blowed it to-
day a man with any cleverness at all
could stand six feet away and hear the
tumblers fall

  so it wasnt any explosion that woke
up old fleming the burglars had
opened the front door with an ordinary
key and lifted off the night chain as
neat as ye please another key opened
the office door they didnt even have
to have one made for that

  maybe where they made the noise
was when they come to the desk yell
notice its been jimmied but by that
time the safe was open and theyd
picked out what they wanted whativer
that was the desk was forced just
to make sure nothin worth while was
being left behind but by this time the
old man upstairs is awake he climbs
into his slippers and gets out in the
hall thats where they hear him
macumber interrupted to beg a match
for his pipe his air was one of no
more than polite interest as he inquired
and how do you know that
clancy relieved himself of an all-too-
patently patient sigh

  because said he they began to
shoot from below as fleming started
downstairs they fired three times
the bulletsll be found in the wall at
the turn of the stairs we havent dug
em out yet but maybe the holesll sat-
isfy ye take it for granted now

  the old man came down shootin
the holes that say so are in the wall
at the foot of the stairs and in the floor
the direction the bullets took speaks for
itself then theres a bullet hole in
the front doorframe and more in the
walls and another in the newel post
making altogether

  nine bullet holes in the floor and
wall and newel post then theres an-
other bullet in flemings left arm and
a last one in his heart eleven all told
as i said

  clancy went fishing in his trousers
pocket and produced a little heap of
shells in the palm of his massive and
hair-covered hand

  heres the evidence of the five shots
that fleming fired he went on they
got him when he still had one to go
that ones left in his revolver that my
mans got in the hall

  with the burr more pronounced the
great one repeated the question which
the subordinate already had answered
once

  wher-r-re are the shells from the
bur-r-rglars revolver-rs 

  i dont know where they are now
profissor admitted clancy amiably
but they were in the chambers of the
guns when the bullets were fired and
thereafter the burglars had a differ-
ent kind of weepon the old reliable
their revolvers didnt eject automati-
cally for gentlemen in the trade of
robbing and killing automatic ejectors
are not advised

  inter-r-resting remarked macum-
ber ive hear-rd as much but i fear-r
ive for-r-gotten why

  firearms said clancy have some
of the characteristics of typewriters-
and handwriting when a revolver or
a rifle has been used a bit it leaves its
signature on the shell of every exploded
cartridge just so a typewriter will
turn out a letter different here and there
than it would come from any other ma-
chine ever made just so an expert can
tell ye whether it was jones or smith
that signed robinson on the hotel regis-
ter

  the red one dropped the five shells
into the great ones hand

  if yell examine these at the base
yell find the indentical mark on each
its barely visible now but under a
when the family were away



microscope itd stand out like a moon
its a little crescent were a thousand
bullets fired from flemings gun that
same trade-mark would be on the shell
of each

  macumber examined the five shells
and passed them to me on each was
the little vague crescent which clancy
had described it was unmistakable
once one looked for it

  the ringing of a bell echoed through
the house as i held the fifth shell in
the bar of light from the rear

  reporters queried macumber

  clancy called back over his shoulder

  more likely the daughter thats go-
ing to be married the bys pay little
attention to murders by burglars beyond
what they get over the phone well be
hearing in a minute what the robbers
came afther

iii

  marcia fleming was a little thorough-
bred  could see recognition of it
aglow behind the pity in macumbers
gray eyes as she stepped into warren
flemings office

  there had been no breakdown-no
sound from her-as she passed the body
in the hall she had had warning of
her fathers death and of the manner
of it that he should be lying there
in consequence presented no reason why
her grief should be paraded before
strangers she kept it valiantly to her-
self  a slip of a girl true in her crisis
to the tenets of a class which say what
you will against it has the art of self-
control

  the girl was composed mistress of
herself absolutely as she nodded toward
clancy her voice low and musical and
even as she said

  there is not much i can tell you
and yet i can certainly supply the mo-
tive which brought burglars into this
house their motive for killing my fa-
ther you have undoubtedly judged for
yourself

  my father put more than one hun-
dred thousand dollars in currency in
that safe last night some one must
have known it find that some one
and you will have found my fathers
murderer

  clancys jaw sagged a trifle i fancied
a hundred thousand he repeated
that was a haul

  macumber with a glance toward the
police officer for his approval asked
you were here yourself miss flem-
ing 

  no said the girl but i know what
fathers plans were and with him
plans were invariably executed accord-
ing to schedule

  what was the occasion for him hav-
ing so much in cash queried clancy
resuming the reins of the interrogation

  the girl glanced from one to the
other as if puzzled by the dual ques-
tioning

  father was an old-fashioned lawyer
with an old-fashioned practice she ex-
plained some of his clients were my
grandfathers clients when the firm was
fleming  fleming father of course
had offices downtown but a great deal
of his practice centered here he was
more counselor than barrister some
of his most important clients never had
set foot in the downtown office some
i believe indeed had never set foot in
wall street

  i see said clancy but you were
saying about the hundred thousand
gracefully excusing the interruption
by ignoring it the girl went on in the
same low tone

  miss fannie de puyster was one of
the oldest-fashioned of fathers old-
fashioned clients for years he had
held a large group of securities belong-
ing to her at quarterly intervals he
collected and passed on to her the re-
turns for reasons of her own miss de
puyster wished to convert these secur-
ities into cash she advised father of
her decision at some time to-day she

was to have come here for the money
it was one of her peculiarities that she
did not desire even a cashiers check
do you know why miss de puyster
wanted to-er cash in

  marcia fleming colored faintly

  i do not believe that is entirely rel-
evant she said but i naturally have
no knowledge of her purpose

  clancy clasped his hands behind him
and set himself to rocking judicially on
his heels after a moment of deliber-
ate silence he inquired

  youre going to marry roland de
puyster aint ye isnt he miss fannie
de puysters nephew

  the color in the girls cheeks deep-
ened she bit her lip

  that is quite correct she replied
coolly but i am sure it has no bear-
ing on your investigation the fact is
that father converted miss de puysters
securities yesterday afternoon i know
he did because he said he was going to
he brought the money here and placed
it in the safe that lie did so i know
for the same reason he said he would
i had luncheon with him yesterday i
know

  i dont suppose hazarded clancy
theres any other reason you could sug-
gest why anybody should want to kill
mr fleming

  the motive for the murder appears
self-evident does it not father was
a man of great pride he was proud
of his family proud of his forbears
proud of himself and his position in
the world i dont want you to mis-
understand father was not a snob in
any sense of the word his was a
wholesome pride and with it as a
matter of course he had a high degree
of moral and physical courage

  when he heard burglars in the house
he did what appeared to him his obvious
duty it would have been the same had
the safe been empty the intrusion was
a challenge to his manhood i wish
he could have slept undisturbed but

he awoke-and he came downstairs a
mans death awaited him

  the girls eyes were brimming as she
finished i convicted clancy as a brute
for that last question macumbers no-
tion of it seemed the same he made
excuses for the two of us shook hands
with clancy bowed low in the direction
of marcia fleming-whose eyes missed
the gesture-and headed up through the
corridor where the medical examiner
lately arrived bent over the body of
warren fleming

iv

  the crowd had melted from the side-
walk outside even the uniformed po-
liceman had taken himself elsewhere
the smile the great one turned on me
was somewhat grim

  what do you think of our mystery
now he asked is your opinion that
of the public which has long since gone
on its busy way

  i must confess said i to a cer-
tain amount of astonishment

  in the particular of the young lady
sur-rely she was a most impressive
young per-r-son as she handled herself
before the august clancy my hear-r-t
went out to her as seldom it has gone
out to living cr-reature-but you lad
i share your sympathy for miss
fleming i said but the occasion
of my astonishment is rather yourself
i have heard you rant-may i use the
word maestro-against the fancy de-
ductive proccesses of some detectives
and you have repeated them to-day
therein lies the one remarkable fea-
ture of what even i observe to be a
thoroughly commonplace case

  in regard to various predictions as
to adventure which i may have made
macumber borrowed a match to touch
off the stubby pipe and i saw his grin
return softened through the flame i
nodded

  just that
when the family were away



  the great one shook his head sor-
rowfully

  it was mental trash so to speak
said he it was but my intention to
show how r-r-idiculous and inconse-
quent are the vaporings of the deduc-
tionists when they know a thing from
beginning to end they pr-r-retend to
have found no more than a thread and
from the thread to weave a shir-r-rt

  the simplicity of this would need
no exposition had you the eyes of ma-
cumber-r and the knowledge of the peo-
ple of the city

  you will mind that some time since
i plucked you by the ar-r-m and pre-
vented you from danger-rously ob-
structing the path of an automobile
which you insisted was lar-rge and red

  the automobile was proceeding
swiftly so i knew the man in it was
on hurried business but with its speed
i was not pr-revented from recognizing
the genial clancy in the back seat

  so far so good i obser-rved the
automobile turning into the street from
which we have just come it slowed
immediately after the turn which told
me the stop would be somewhere with-
in the block do you now per-r-ceive
to an extent said i perhaps
you will explain the reference to the
four-story brownstone house

  as deep a mystery as the revela-
tions concerned the red-haired man with
the little finger missing from the left
hand macumber said chuckling
the entire block-as you will have no-
ticed maybe-is composed of houses
that are four stories high and have
brownstone fronts the general de-
scription applies to the whole street
thr-rough which i have walked several
times in my day

  i had been saving a poser i deliv-
ered myself of it in triumph

  guesswork or the black art was
somewhere be good enough to ex-
plain why you should have deduced the
crime as murder

  macumber threw back his big head
and laughed in his hearty noiseless way

  that is the poser lad he con-
ceded your-r acumen is nothing
shor-rt of sensational however could
i explain the wizardry except by say-
ing that i know-as do quite a few
others in our fair city-that clancy is
connected with the homicide bureau

v

  at macumbers hotel in the forties
the great one indicated by a touch on
my arm rather than by spoken word that
he wished me to remain with him he
swept up an armful of evening news-
papers from the stand in the lobby and
spread them before me when we were
in his rooms

  lawyer dies battling burglars
headlined the record

  another had it

killed defending clients fortune

  macumber read the newspaper ac-
counts aloud their descriptions of the
fight in the fleming residence recon-
structed by rewrite men who had seen
not even the outside of the place were
greatly at variance on the routine de-
tails all agreed fleming had died as
a hero patently the battle had occurred
shortly after three oclock in the morn-
ing the street had been deserted at the
time and there were only the stains on
the front steps to show that one of the
intruders had been hit and that this
one at any rate had left as he had en-
tered

  and now what would you make of
it all lad he concluded

  in what respect

  the great one deliberately refilled
his pipe from the familiar battered tin
box

  and yet said he does not the
whole str-ructure of the mur-rder the-
ory depend on so flimsy a thing as a
tiny brass shell

  he divined my mystification


detective story magazine

  the crime is so obviously one of
mur-r-der that we can see nothing else
he continued we know that a great
many shots have been fired that a safe
has been opened and that a man whom
the world regards as a good man is
dead o e u

  but one steeped as myself in the
somber art of misdirection cannot be
blamed for seeing evidences of misdi-
rection where crime has been committed
per-r-haps my imagination is over-r-
heated nevertheless i make the point
that no living man saw any one but
warren fleming entering or leaving the
house

  fur-r-ther i make the point that the
stains on the steps might have come
from a tiny cut-such a one as per-r-
haps you or clancy did not notice on
the ar-r-m of fleming  mean their
appearance on the steps might have
been the result of design rather than
of accident

  beyond this the eye is a true enough
measure to justify the asser-r-tion that
the bullets in the walls and floors and
the newel post are of the same caliber
as the bullet in flemings hear-r-t do
you follow me

  i nodded the great one rose and
strode to the window his voice came
back over his shoulder as he gazed re-
flectively down into the quieting street

  it would appear-r an injustice may-
hap but let us assume that a man of
worldly position and pride had taken
the one misstep to which all of us are
pr-rone suppose that convertible prop-
er-r-ties intrusted to him had been mis-
applied suppose that believing there
would be plenty of time for adjustment
he had suddenly been called upon to
pr-roduce what he did not have

  we might even go far-r-ther and
suppose this man had a ver-ry fine
daughter that she was about to make
a good marriage we must concede
would but add to his distr-ress

  there lad you have a hypothetical

case what might we expect the man
in question to do

  kill himself aye lad that would
be the impulse but would not suicide
be confession there would be the
disgrace of self-destruction and on top
of it where would be the secur-rities 

  but we shall say our man has a
lawyers mind planning planning he
sees the possibility of killing himself
and making his death appear the wor-r-k
of burglars where then are the se-
cur-rities ah lad that is simply a
case of where are the burglars the
memory of the man and the pride of
his family are protected he may have
died wor-r-th not a penny but the
wor-r-ld can only respect him

  macumber paused the stubby pipe
was out again he dropped again into
the chair opposite mine and puffed hard
for a moment

  i have stated only a hypothetical
case he resumed from bloodstains
to bullet holes from open safe to jim-
mied desk this would have been a case
of misdirection

  misdirection is the magicians art
and the great macumber is rather ma-
gician than detective it is only the
theory i have stated that interests me

  but to puzzle me another-r hypo-
thetical case arises suppose there
were another man with y pr-roper re-
spect for the law who had it within
his power to tear the trappings of de-
ceit from the suicide of a guilty man
another man with due r-regard for
property rights and the like  should
he expose the fraud shame a family
halt a marriage and br-r-reak the heart
of as fair a lassie as ever walked

  i looked for a light of mockery be-
hind macumbers steady and earnest
glance it was not there he answered
the question for himself

  no lad the thing to do would be
to wait if the suicide had left a goodly
estate then the truth must be told to
justify a legitimate claim against it
when the family were away



if lie died without estate what would
the truths good be as against the
harm 

  but you are theorizing entirely i
interposed

  macumber slowly shook his head
theres something you havent taken
into consideration i assured him
there is the evidence of the exploded
shells that is clear enough fleming
fired five times there were only cham-
bers for six cartridges in his revolver
one cartridge was left unexploded in
the gun and we know where eleven
bullets went

  an excellent point acquiesced ma-
cumber indeed the pivotal point
we know the five shells picked up by
the police came from flemings weapon
the marks upon their bases are proof
of it every one knows after all the
expert testimony to the fact that a gun
leaves its signature but suppose that
the man in the hypothetical case-that
warren fleming himself had first emp-
tied his revolver gathered up the shells
quickly reloaded and finished the job
what in that case would have be-
come of the shells

  a fraction of a second said ma-
cumber would have sufficed to put
them out of sight per-r-haps and
per-r-haps not you will have noticed a
grating in the floor near the body-
par-r-t of a disused hot-air heating sys-
tem sear-r-ch beneath it might have
inter-resting results but i shall not
look or suggest looking

  the room was in semidarkness the
great one switched on the reading lamp
beside use

  on so flimsy a thing as a little shell
he mused the shots had to come
quickly you know with no great space
between the first six and the second
five sharper ears might have been lis-
tening than actually heard there
would be haste in gathering up the
spilled shells of the first series five
might have been picked up instead of
six one might have been forgotten that
to a shrewd mind would have told the
whole story

  that one well say might have been
missed by the police too it might even
have lain where the body falling cov-
er-red all but a glinting rim of it some
one with no official concern in the mat-
ter-some one with a less precise duty
to perform than a policemans-might
have been first to see it

  you

  my mind darted back to the insignifi-
cant episode in the entrance hall-ma-
cumber stumbling against the dead
mans arm and bending to replace it
i looked at him hard

  the same said the great one

  he flipped on the table before me a
little brass shell i held it in the rose-
colored light from the reading lamp

  it was not a strong light-but strong
enough to illuminate on the base the
identical little crescent i had seen five
times before that day in the residential
office of the hero warren fleming

thinks well of man who robbed her

co favorably was mrs george f heubeck of baltimore maryland impressed
 with the courtesy of the burglar who robbed her recently of one thousand
dollars worth of jewels that she notified the police that she did not want him
to be imprisoned if he should be caught

    i feel sure he was a perfect gentleman she said and i am sorry that
he fell into such temptation i am sure he is capable of more honorable em-
ployment

    fscott campbell

heriff cudworth was
very skeptical at first while
riding alone into the attractive
residential town about dusk
one may evening he was suddenly
startled by appalling cries for help from
the direction of a narrow road through
the wooded country beyond that out-
skirt of the town

  sheriff cudworth sprang from his
car and ran through the intervening
woods and shrubbery he soon came in
view of the sandy road a girl of nine-
teen supporting a younger sister who
was very near fainting both of whom
the sheriff knew well uttered a cry of
relief when she saw him approaching

  thank heaven  she exclaimed
courage mabel dont faint heres
the sheriff oh mr cudworth wre have
been terribly frightened

  frightened by what miss venner
lie inquired gazing sharply around

 that man-that horrible man
gasped the younger girl still cowering
close to her sister has he gone

clara  has he-

  yes yes dear he has gone i never

saw such a frightful-

  there there calm yourselves cud-
worth kindly interrupted he was a
big genial man around fifty and very
popular in shelby theres nothing
to be afraid of where did you see the
man what sort of a fellow- was he
frightful clara venner repeated
he came through the shrubbery over
there and stood staring at us we were

afraid he was going to attack us his
eyes were like balls of lire he was as
green as grass

  green cudworth echoed do
you mean he was a rube a country-
man 

  no no not at all clara exclaimed
i mean his color he was bright green
from head to foot

  nonsense cudworth laughed
who ever heard of a green man
thats absurd you arent color blind
are you

  we arent both color blind said
mabel hastening to corroborate her sis-
ter the man was green mr cud-
worth nearly as green as grass i saw
him plainly he was horrible a half-
clad gigantic-

  no no mabel not gigantic clara
interrupted more calmly dont ex-
aggerate he was appalling enough
without that he was quite tall mr
cudworth but not uncommonly large
mabel was so frightened that he looked
to her like a giant

  how was he dressed asked the
sheriff scarcely able to credit the
strange story

  he wore shabby gray trousers and
a flannel shirt both very much soiled
and a tattered felt hat he had no
coat or vest his shirt was partly un-
buttoned exposing his neck and breast
they were a striking shade of green
mr cudworth like his hands and face
i think he must be that color from head
to foot this sounds incredible i know
a study in green



but its absolutely true clara venner
earnestly insisted he looked like a
crazy man a maniac i never saw such

a shocking-

  stop a moment cudworth inter-
rupted there comes doctor wykoff
he also has seen this mysterious green
man perhaps judging from the speed
with which he is riding

  doctor alexis wykoff was a promi-
nent shelby physician he had more
than a local reputation too due to his
frequent contributions to the leading
medical journals to his discovery of a
valuable vaccine to his successful ex-
periments with electricity as a curative
agent and to his profound and practi-
cal knowledge of botany and chemistry
having for years spent half his time in a
well-equipped laboratory in the grounds
of his estate he was a well-built im-
pressive man of forty-five with a strong
and somewhat austere face smooth
shaven with a very dark complexion
and heavy brows they were knit with
a frown over his dark eyes when
mounted on a powerful roan horse he
approached in a cloud of dust through
the woodland road and stopped near
the sheriff and his companions

  well well whats wrong cud-
worth he inquired familiarly evi-
dently somewhat excited good eve-
ning young ladies whats the trouble
sheriff

  something moresingular than seri-
ously wrong doctor i imagine cud-
worth eyed him a bit curiously what
led you to think there was any trouble
i heard screams and cries for help
or thought i did said the physician
i came to find out what caused them
you heard them doctor wykoff all
right cudworth told him these
girls were badly frightened by some fel-
low either a lunatic or the good lord
know what who has stained himself

grass green and-

  grass green doctor wykoff ex-
claimed interrupting incredible

where did you see him miss venner
he turned abruptly to the elder girl
what was he doing where did he
go

  he ran in that direction when we be-
gan to scream said clara pointing into
the woods he appeared like a wild
man doctor wykoff and vanished as
quickly as he came

  ill look for his footprints cud-
worth remarked i dont think how-
ever that we could trace him

  doctor wykoff dismounted and fol-
lowed him while the girls remained by
the side of the road the sheriff soon
found several footprints in the damp
earth under the shrubbery one of which
he carefully measured while telling the
physician more precisely what the two
girls had stated

  i dont take much stock in it he
quietly added there was a man here
no doubt but i guess the green stuff
was an optical illusion they were de-
ceived in the dusk or got their absurd
impression in some way from the sur-
rounding foliage theres no lunatic
asylum near here from which an inmate
has escaped and surely no sane man
would stain himself bright green
hed be a bird doctor wykoff
said dryly

bird is right cudworth muttered
that really is your opinion sheriff
is it doctor wykoff inquired casually

  certainly cudworth paused and
nodded have you any other 

  none whatever said the physician
he turned to remount his horse ill
ride on a bit nevertheless and try to

find the fellow if i succeed-

  grab him and bring him to me
cudworth interrupted take it from
me doctor ill put him through a laun-
dry that will wash the green off him
the girls still are nervous ill take
them home in my car

  but it is doubtful if doctor wykoff
heard the last for he was already rid-
ing away at top speed


detective story magazine

  sheriff cudworth was not deeply im-
pressed he did not think the incident
of serious importance he decided that
the venner girls were mistaken that in
their sudden excitement both had re-
ceived a wrong impression of the un-
known man whom they had seen only
for a moment in the twilight that he
was really green seemed too extraordin-
ary too absurd and fantastical for seri-
ous consideration

  but sheriff cudworth soon changed
his mind other persons saw the mys-
terious green man they confirmed the
statements of the venner girls none
had more than a brief glimpse of him
however always in some part of the
woods into the depths of which he fled
when discovered uttering wild discor-
dant cries and making fierce gesticula-
tions children playing in the woods
caught sight of him and ran home in
frantic terror petty thefts soon were
reported footprints identical with that
measured by the sheriff were found in
back yards and alleys the marauder
was prowling into the town by night
women became alarmed and dared not
venture out doors and windows were
kept securely locked men who never
had owned a weapon and who scarcely
dared to fire one bought guns revol-
vers and pistols all efforts to trace
and capture the green man were prov-
ing futile

  shelby was becoming terrorized the
report went abroad that in the woods
was a dangerous madman a green
maniac whom the police could not cap-
ture sheriff cudworth found himself
with his reputation at stake and his of-
ficial head in danger

  its got to be done ive got to get
that green guy by thunder if i lose
a leg he told himself

  sheriff cudworth was alone late that
evening in his office on the ground floor
of the county court house he had
been detained by a storm which still
was raging vivid lightning flashes il-

lumined the two uncurtained windows
behind him while he sat at his desk
and tried to solve the exasperating prob-
lem

  this alleged green man cant be any
different from other men cudworth
grimly reasoned he did not pretend
to be an expert detective but he had
plenty of good common sense there
must be some natural cause for his ex-
traordinary color he cant be simply
perpetrating a hoax he wouldnt pro-
long it day and night for two weeks
furthermore he could not have come
from any great distance or he would
have been seen in other localities he
must be some local man therefore
familiar with the town and neighbor-
ing woods or we very soon could have
run him down he sure is not green
in woodcraft green be hanged i
dont believe it

  cudworths frowning gaze rose a
little it rested on a mirror on a wall
back of his desk he felt a sudden
chill a vivid lightning flash illumined
the window directly behind him and he
saw a man gazing through the window
his eyes were abnormally bright and
he had a round repulsive face drawn
and tense but void of any definite ex-
pression and of a peculiar shade of
green

  cudworth did not stir he saw that
his discovery was not suspected he
watched the uncanny figure in the feeble
light from within when the glare with-
out had vanished then the sheriff got
up deliberately and removed his coat as
if the room was too warm and he had
no intention of going out presently
without having glanced toward the win-
dow he sauntered into the adjoining
corridor then he hastened to the front
door stole quickly around the building
pistol in hand and crept toward his of-
fice window but his design had been
suspected the green man had fled

  sheriff cudworth made the most of
what he had seen and of the deduc-
a study in green



tions mentioned he called late the fol-
lowing afternoon on mrs dudley car-
roll a wealthy widow prominent in
local society and whose home was the
most beautiful in shelby she was a
very attractive woman of middle age
and was well acquainted with cudworth
and his family

  what have i done sheriff she said
jestingly laughing when she received
him in her library are you after me
for something

  i would be mrs carroll if i were
a single man and about your own age
cudworth dryly told her no im not
after you he said more seriously when
seated ive heard that your colored
chauffeur sam white has been away
for a month or more

  sam mrs carroll queried yes
sheriff he has you surely dont want
him for any offense he has grown up
in my employ hes as honest as the
day is long hes the best-natured man
in the world

  i agree with you cudworth told
her i merely want to learn where he
has gone

  the sheriff was acquainted with sam
white he had often seen him going
to church on a sunday with mrs car-
rolls youngest servant a pretty mulatto
girl named eliza black their names
had always seemed to him to be ab-
surdly antithetical for sam white was
very dark and eliza black almost fair
by comparison

  well to tell the truth sheriff i dont
know where sam has gone mrs car-
roll admitted he asked permission
to go away for a week or two about
a month ago she explained i gave
him some money and told him to go
ahead and enjoy himself as it was his
first holiday

  did he say where he was going
cudworth inquired

  he did not mrs cudworth said
more gravely he was very reticent
about it

  what did he say

  he stated that he had a little scheme
in view strictly private and that he
wanted to investigate it he did not
tell eliza about it either

  did he say wdien he would return
probably in a week or ten days was
the way he put il he admitted how-
ever that it might take a little longer
have you heard from him during
his absence cudworths calm blue
eyes had narrowed slightly

  only once said mrs carroll
eliza received a letter from him three
days after he left the poor girl is
dreadfully anxious about him per-
haps he has been killed by that terrible
madman we are hearing so much about
she made herself so ill over it that i
called doctor wykoff yesterday he
prescribed for her and said he thinks
the madman will soon be caught in
fact he is spending much of his own
time trying to catch him

  i heard so this morning cudworth
informed her did he say why he was
specially anxious to secure the man
he did not

  he may want to diagnose the ex-
traordinary case cudworth allowed
experiment to learn the cause and cure
of so singular a malady he has a
very strong propensity for that sort of
thing

  very true that same propensity has
made him quite famous mrs carroll
reminded him you may question
eliza if you wish sheriff but i feel sure
she can add nothing to what i have told
you i guess sam will return safely
sooner or later

  i think so cudworth told her do
you know what he wrote to eliza 
not a word relating to his little
scheme or regarding his whereabouts
he did say however that he was with
a friend that he was feeling fine and
that he reckoned as how she wouldnt
know her big stick of licorice when he
came back home mrs carroll told


detective story magazine

him laughing that was just the way
he put it

  do you know where the letter was
mailed cudworth inquired

  in north shelby mrs carroll
quickly informed him eliza called my
attention to the postmark so you see
sheriff sam has not gone very far
away

  yes i see cudworth smiled a bit
oddly no i wont question the girl
he added as lie rose to go you know
mrs carroll ive always thought pretty
well of sam

  why not  she inquired hes an
honest simple kind-hearted darky
everybody thinks well of sam

  sheriff cudworth had an idea that
very few thought well of sam about
that time

ii

  sheriff cudworth had rather more
than an idea when he first learned of
sam whites absence when he also re-
called the hurried arrival of doctor
wykoft upon the spot where the venner
girls were so badlv frightened

  cudwoiths idea had become a theory
and he looked more grimly determined
when he left and started for the home
of the physician

  but sheriff cudworth did not call on
the physician immediately it was after
six oclock and he figured that doctor
wykoff probably was at dinner with his
family and that lie could make the in-
vestigations he had in view secretly

  cudworth strode on more rapidly and
soon brought up at a low wall in the
rear of the physicians extensive estate
it was about a quarter of a mile from
the woodland road where the green man
first had been seen the sheriff de-
duced a point from the last and hidden
from observation by the intervening
orchard a stable a garage and a large
cement laboratory all of which occu-
pied the rear grounds he began an in-

spection of the earth on both sides of
the wall

  cudworth soon discovered what he
was seeking several footprints corre-
sponding with that of the much wanted
man lie found them on both sides
of the wall and he soon observed that
all of them pointed away from the estate
and toward the distant woods

  not one points toward the place
he muttered plainly then he did not
come this way and afterward depart
instead he only left in this direction and
escaped toward the woods the space
between the tracks shows plainly that
he was running directly in a line from
the laboratory too humph ill find
out about that

  he sprang over the wall and stole
through the orchard where apple and
peach trees were in blossom sweet and
beautiful in the softened light of the
setting sun he paused at the rear wall
of the laboratory where he briefly in-
spected two ground glass windows and
peered through a small hole where a
piece had been broken from one of the
panes he could see indistinctly that
slats appeared to be nailed across the
window and that the room contained a
cot on which a wrinkled blanket and
pillow were lying

  cudworths features had hardened
he stole around to the front door to be
sure it was locked and that the building
was unoccupied then he returned to
the rear and quickly broke the other
window sufficiently for him to open it
and enter

  he climbed over the sill into a
shelved closet where there were count-
less bottles phials and jars each labeled
with a red sticker it obviously was
a closet in which poisons were stored
for safe keeping

  cudworth found the door unlocked
however and he entered the adjoining
room a spacious finely equipped labora-
tory he had no immediate interest in
the details of it but hastened into a
a study in green



small rear room instead where he soon
confirmed his suspicions stout slats
were nailed across the window casing
the cot and the room itself were in
some disorder in one corner was a
canvas extension case containing a
quantity of clothing the most of it
had not been worn since it was laun-
dered

  cudworth crouched in the corner to
examine the garments the sun had set
and the light in the room was waning
but after a brief search he found what
he was seeking the mans initials on
one of the linen shirts he was so in-
tent upon his inspection of the garments
that he had no thought of an intruder
until a threatening voice spoke

  what are you doing get up

  the sheriff sprang up as if electrified
turned sharply toward the door and
saw doctor alexis wykoff

what are you doing he repeated
put down that gun cudworth
eyed him sternly without moving it
may go off by chance you may end
with killing me

  you broke in here like a thief wy-
koff accused him with increasing sever-
ity if i were to kill you cudworth
i could justify it in any criminal court
could you justify it in your own
conscience cudworth demanded
how about that

  a man with his liberty menaced his
reputation at stake with his entire fu-
ture involved and the happiness of his
home and family does not confer long
with his conscience doctor wykoff re-
torted his voice trembled slightly but
he still maintained a threatening atti-
tude

  put down the gun cudworth re-
peated you dont intend to shoot me
wykoff or you would have done so at
once men bent upon murder dont stop
to discuss the crime or to point out to
their victims the occasion for it
what are you doing here wykoff
again demanded

  i want to learn what you know about
sam white said the sheriff bluntly

  why do you suppose i know any-
thing about him

  i know you do cudworth said
sternly he has been confined here
that barred window tells the story
these garments one bearing his ini-
tials establish his identity come to
your senses wykoff and come across
with the truth he advised what ex-
perimental trick have you pulled off on
sam white that has caused him to
lose his head and turned him as green
as a melon come across shooting
me wont get you anything

  doctor wykoff drew up stiffly and
tossed his pistol on the cot i did not
intend to shoot you cudworth as you
inferred he said coldly

  thats more like it said the sheriff
i would not kill you cudworth or
any other man to save my soul from
perdition the physician repeated

  now youre talking wykoff cud-
worth said approvingly what the
deuce is the meaning of all this i
know you have something to hide or
you would have come forward at once
with a frank and open statement it
goes without saying doctor wykoff
that ill do anything that i can for you
cudworth assured him in a kindly man-
ner characteristic of him if it is

necessary to suppress-

  no more of that doctor wykoff
checked him gravely and drew back into
the laboratory come this way cud-
worth and sit down ill tell you all
about it

  take your own course

  i have repeatedly been impelled to
do so there is so much at stake how-
ever that i refrained as long as i had
any hope of getting hold of sam white
again and setting him right without ex-
posure there is a point you know
beyond which a physician is not justified
in experimenting on a human subject i
went a step too far

  i suspected it cudworth told him
as they sat down in the laboratory if

sam white-

  i thought i possibly would find him
here doctor wykoff interrupted i
hoped that i would but i was not sure
in what condition i would find him or
how violent he still might be thats
why i entered quietly and discovered
you i had my pistol only to awe and
intimidate him its a singular case
cudworth and a most deplorable one
tell me about it said the sheriff
ill do all i can to aid you

  youre very good doctor wykoff
thanked him with an appreciative nod
but i must not go into the details at
this time it would take hours for me
to state the scientific features of the
case i will tell you the superficial facts
however and later give you all of the
details

  very good cudworth said approv-
ingly that may be sufficient

  it is by no means a new thing sher-
iff for human beings to make altera-
tions in their personal appearance
changes which they regard as improve-
ments upon nature or which fashion
arbitrarily dictates it began in the
garden of eden and has been continued
in every country and by every race up
to the present day beauty is really
a matter of taste and custom small
feet is a requisite in china the fiji
islanders dye their hair various bright
colors stained teeth and nails painted
bodies and-but lord harry why at-
tempt to enumerate them he broke off
abruptly you know all that as well
as i 

  certainly cudworth nodded go
on

  its common enough right here at
home doctor wykoff continued
women paint pencil their brows and
stain their lips specialists study the
problem of removing wrinkles and the
telltale traces of approaching age ones
complexion is often ones chief con-

cern observe my own i am very
dark and swarthy that is one reason
perhaps why i have made a special
study of the skin and sought ways and
means to modify the pigment causing
ones color and complexion

  i follow you said cudworth i
anticipate what is coming

 quite likely doctor wykoff
smiled faintly the color of the skin
has always held an important place
among physical criteria of the human
race physiology explains color as a
consequence of climate and even diet
this pigment or coloring matter under
the epidermis or rather under the
second skin is not peculiar to the ne-
groid or other colored races but is com-
mon to all human beings it is simply
more abundant in certain people

  i understand said the sheriff
but i must come to the point
doctor wykoff said stiffening i have
been trying for a long time to find some
way to reach and modify this coloring
pigment so as to permanently alter ones
complexion i thought i had succeeded
both by means of an ingredient taken
internally and by the injection of a
chemical composition into the skin i
have invented an electrical machine with
which the injection may be accom-
plished somewhat as tattoo work is
done

  having faith in it i was very
anxious to get a willing subject for the
experiment i realized that my reputa-
tion would be placed in jeopardy but i
felt so sure i was right that i resolved
to risk it it so happened however that
the subject came to me voluntarily
how did that occur

  it appeared that sam white heard
me discussing the possibility of altering
ones color with a friend one day doc-
tor wykoff explained well he came
to me a little later and wanted to know
if i could reduce his color as he put it
said the physician i asked him why
he objected to it he said he didnt
a study in green



specially object to it but that he was in
love with a mulatto girl eliza black
who joshed him a good deal about his
color and that he feared she would not
marry him because he was so dark

  i see cudworth suppressed a
smile

  i told sam i thought it could be
done doctor wykoff went on gravely
i also was perfectly frank with him
i told him he would be taking a chance
that it was only an experiment but he
was very anxious for the operation

  sam is very fond of eliza cud-
worth remarked

  well to make a long story short
cudworth i consented to attempt it
said the physician i bound sam to
absolute secrecy he paused then
shrugged his broad shoulders remorse-
fully well i performed the opera-
tion words could not describe my
horror when i found cudworth that
the process not only had turned him
green but that the ingredients injected
into his blood had also affected his
brain

  sam went violently insane for a
time doctor wykoff continued i
drugged him heavily to prevent his es-
cape and kept him in the laboratory for
two weeks hoping his abnormal condi-
tion would in time be dispelled it had
begun to do so i think when he es-
caped that was just before he terri-
fied the venner girls one evening i
was after him when i joined you at
that time

  i suspected it cudworth informed
him

  since then i have been trying to get
him back here wykoff went on i
shall be ruined professionally and crim-
inally liable unless he can be found and
cured i feel reasonably sure that he
is gradually returning to a normal con-
dition i base that belief upon the
latest descriptions of those who have
seen him and say that his color is be-
coming darker and taking on a mot-

tled appearance if he could be found
and brought here where i could give
him proper treatment i feel sure i could
restore him to his normal condition on
the other hand i will be hopelessly en-
tangled-

  stop a bit cudworth leaned for-
ward hush not a sound

  what do you hear doctor wykoff
whispered

  wait not a sound dont move
sheriff cudworth arose and tiptoed
toward the open front door his
trained ears detected a sound like
stealthy footsteps back of the building
the physician waited with ears strained
and eyes aglow his nerves quivering
with suspense under a sudden unex-
pected hope the sheriff had inspired
then he heard his voice from some
point back of the building shouting
sternly

  hold on ill have you this time
dont you bolt again sam or ill wing
you with a chunk of lead come here

come here at once sam or ill-

  doctor wykoff heard no more he
sprang up with a cry of relief and stag-
gered toward the door just as sheriff
cudworth with a grip on the arm and
neck of the much wanted man returned
to the laboratory

  it later appeared that doctor wykoff
was right that sam white had begun to
throw off his abnormal condition that
he had just begun to realize his own
identity and that something was wrong
with him and he was returning to the
physician for aid and advice

  it seems needless to add that sam
white received a generous amount of
both he came out of the experiment
all right and later married the mulatto
girl the true circumstances were
never suspected by the public much to
doctor wykoffs relief

  the extraordinary feature of the case
was that sam white when completely
restored was a shade darker than be-

o	after that-well after that
the elephant just kept on liv-
ing with his little friends
tommy and betty giving

them rides on his broad back and-

  eunice gay stole a glance toward the
bed the flushed little face with tired
eyes closed and red lips parted slightly
was framed in the mass of dark curls
against the pillow carl was asleep

  poor little fellow  said the gov-
erness leaning over and gently closing
the childs lips with her fingers to in-
duce a more natural breathing poor
baby boy one thing at any rate i
know and will always be able to remem-
ber hes had a better time since ive
been here than he ever had before in
all his five soul-starved years she
smiled with a mothering tenderness
how breathlessly he hangs upon those
stories of mine and how eagerly he
looks forward to bedtime each night
just for me to tell them she crossed
to the wall and pulled the cord which
reduced the light to a dim glare then
she tiptoed out of the room and closed
the door softly

  eunice gay had seen other children
who had claimed her sympathy and her
pity many of them but they had been
of the poorer classes and their needs
had been physical and material but
carl dodge with the best of food and
clothing with the luxurious airy sur-
roundings of the riverside drive apart-
ment and the park along the shore

where he took his daily airing little carl
was the surest waif of them all for
the thing that was missing in his life
except in so far as she his hired gov-
erness gave it to him was the loving
care and the sympathetic understanding
which are far more to a child than all
the privileges of wealth

  carls mother had died too long ago
for him to remember so the frosty-
faced mrs meath the cook and house-
keeper of the establishment had told
her and rufus dodge his father and
eunice gays employer since a month
ago seemed to have no spark of warmth
or feeling in his nature his business
appeared to be the center and sum of
his life the girl wondered if all bro-
kers all financial people were as cold as
rufus dodge and a protest rose in her
mind what could any man find more
important more enthralling than the
love and confidence of a little child
especially his own 

  but these were no new thoughts to
her and she put them out of her mind
as she made for the telephone in the
living room and called a number which
from almost daily repetition had be-
come very familiar to her save for
the sleeping boy and mrs meath wrho
was preparing a late dinner she was
alone in the apartment the butler
who was the cooks husband acted occa-
sionally as chauffeur for his master and
his absence wras nothing unusual

  hello said eunice into the trans-
a blocked get-away



mitter this is miss gay about
that frock of mine i want to find
out    what not ready yet but
you told me yesterday    yes but i
positively must have it to-morrow to-
morrow yes by ten oclock in the fore-
noon at the very latest all right be
sure now ten oclock to-morrow
good-by

  she hung up the receiver with a sat-
isfied air turned out the light and went
to her own room which adjoined that of
her charge there she took up a book
which she had been reading and settled
in an easy-chair the light over her
shoulder but her mind did not im-
mediately revert to the book she
thought again of the youngster in the
next room of the pity of it all how
hungrily he listened to the stories which
she told him and even in his play it
was not the expensive elaborate toys
and mechanical contrivances in which
he chiefly delighted but rather the sim-
ple set of blocks which she herself had
bought him the blocks bearing pictures
and letters stamped on their sides from
which he was already beginning to learn
the alphabet they had cost her only
a quarter yet carl had played happily
all the afternoon with them under the
big sunny window in his fathers study

  it occurred to eunice that the blocks
were still in the study it would not do
to have the father stumble over them
he made no allowances for the presence
of a child in the house she rose and
crossed the lighted hall to the living
room and then went to the study the
blocks lay piled in a fantastic house
near the window the girl spread out
her apron a badge of her position in
the household to form a bag to hold
them when she had gathered them all
she switched out the light and made for
the open door of the living room

  suddenly she stopped and stood rigid
as she heard some one enter the living-
room from the hall before she could
start again a voice came to her well

that ought to draw a herring across the
trail it was the voice of herbert
meath the butler and chauffeur

  hush her employers voice came
to her she might-where is that
girl 

  meath in a lowered voice which was
yet plainly audible through the open
door replied in her own room i
looked from the hall her doors shut
and you can see the light over the tran-
som she always spends the evening in
there reading

  just look again then to make sure

  eunice gay instinctively drew back
against the wall of the study her dis-
covery now would cause embarrass-
ment at the very least she must remain
concealed

  yes shes in there all right said
meath i listened at the door and
heard her drawing down the window
shade it must have been the breeze
rattling the shade thought eunice
thankfully she had left her window
partly open

  the living-room lights were snapped
on and eunice concluded that mr
dodge and the butler had seated them-
selves

  yes said dodge to-days little
business ought to make things perfectly
safe not that any one had begun to
suspect but the fact that i myself have
been victimized by the notorious gang
of bond thieves ought to prevent any
one from suspecting he chuckled
it will be in all the papers to-morrow
i had the police in and a reporter or
two asked to see me also i think ill
olter a reward for the recovery of the
bonds just to clinch the matter

  and hire private detectives to run
them to earth suggested meath sar-
donically

  yes i intend to do just that
theres a young fellow a licensed pri-
vate detective thats been specializing in
these bond thefts cant have much
other business to take his attention i


detective story magazine

 guess old barlow that broker in my
 building whom we nicked for that big
 haul last month was telling me about
 him he hired this young detective to
 trace his bonds for him again a
 chuckle wouldnt barlows old eyes
 pop out if he could see where his pre-
 cious securities are at this moment
 but about this detective maxwell
 george maxwell thats his name i
 called his office from in town but hed
 left look him up in the book will you
 herbert call him at his house ill
 talk to him when youve got the connec-
 tion

   eunice shrinking breathlessly against
 the wall in the next room heard the
 butler turning the leaves of the tele-
 phone directory instinctively her eyes
 turned in the darkness to the square
 safe in the corner of the study there
 unless she was greatly mistaken there
 was the hiding place of barlows bonds
 and no doubt of others belonging to
 various owners who had suffered re-
 cently from what had become a regular
 epidemic of thefts

   beverly eight-three-o party j
 the butler repeated the number to him-
 self no doubt he was copying it onto
 a slip of paper beverly eight-three-o
 party j wait that number is-

   well hurry and call him

   that number repeated meath
 wait ive got it  his voice sank to
 a hoarse whisper i knew id heard
 it before thats the number that miss
 gay has been calling nearly every eve-
 ning 

   there was a tense silence followed
 at last by the crisp cruel tones of mr
 dodge you mean to tell me that that
 girl has been phoning to this maxwell
 this detective from here that youve
 heard her doing it 

   ive heard her call that number
 averred meath so has my wife but
 from anything i heard her say i
 thought it was some dressmaker she was
 talking to the girl was quite open

about the calls i wondered though
why she had to talk to her dressmaker
so often

  youre sure of that number asked
dodge that its maxwells i mean 
heres the book and there it is in
plain print

  then safd dodge slowly in a voice
that was chilling in its harshness the
girls a spy a detective herself prob-
ably  that dressmaking talk would be
some sort of code by which she could
talk to maxwell unsuspected and if
shes a spy she must have had some
reason for coming here she may have

had opportunities to learn-

  meath finished for him oh if
shes a spy and there dont seem to be
much doubt about that then the games
up she might not have her case com-
plete against us yet but its a cinch shes
got something and we cant stand an
investigation

  no agreed dodge and shes
been reporting to this detective every
night or so no telling what he already
knows but we can prevent his learning
any more from her

  you-you aint going to kill her
the pseudo broker laughed shortly
not that she doesnt deserve it but
it wont be necessary here you look
up a train for chicago that we can take
to-night weve got to pull out right
away no telling when this sleuth will
be down on us no use trying to leave
the country ive got it all fixed in
chi for lying low just anticipating such
a time as this no we wont kill the
girl well give her a free trip along
with us to think of her with her
dolls face going around here so inno-
cent  but by judas shes going to live
to see the day when itll be the sorriest
thing she ever did to come spying into
my business

  but we cant take her not on a pub-
lic railroad train protested meath
heres the one we want leaves at one-
ten thatll give us five or six hours to
a blocked

pack but the girl would give us away
to the conductor to the police

  dont you worry about that said
dodge ive got something in a hypo-
dermic here in my pocket thatll fix
her shell just about be able to walk
to look alive but she wont be talking
you can bet for all practical purposes
shell be as good as unconscious your
wife will be with her and we can ex-
plain that shes my invalid sister or
wife even he chuckled well get
two staterooms in that one-ten and
meath you better go and bring the girl
in here now dont want any chance
of her slipping out on us at this time
well let her know that were onto her
game then well truss her up and gag
her till we get ready to go this drug
only lasts a couple of hours ill save
it and inject it just before we start
thatll keep her fixed until were safely
on the train and in our staterooms
then mrs meath can tie and gag her
again

  the butler rose and took a couple of
steps toward the hall as he did so a
distinct sound came from the open door
of the darkened study a sound as of a
block of wood dropping on the carpet
both men dashed into the smaller room
and meath snapped on the light

  so cried dodge grasping the
shrinking girl roughly by the arm
youre here are you my fine lady
its just as well it saves my repeating
what ive just been talking over with
meath pretty neat you thought you
were didnt you he sneered into
her face im just wondering what
youll be thinking after we get to chi-
cago one thing im willing to bet
they wont be happy thoughts

  george maxwell paced up and down
in the narrow confines of his office
the place though small had been fur-
nished in a way to impress a possible

get-away	

client with prosperity a prosperity
which had not as yet visited it a few-
small jobs of a routine nature mere
crumbs from the table of a large agency
which had formerly employed him
were the only bits of business which
had yet come his way except for the
bond-theft affair and in that he was
a sort of volunteer working without
compensation unless he should succeed
in getting the necessary evidence against
the criminal or criminals in that case
the rewards offered would more than
compensate him for the time he had
spent not to mention the prestige which
would accrue to him	s

  that he would succeed he felt con-
fident he had stumbled upon a clew
which apparently had escaped the police
and the other detectives in following
it he had directed his suspicions squarely
at rufus dodge a broker and specu-
lator a man of apparent respectability
and integrity

  but between the clew which after
all lay largely in maxwells own intui-
tion and actual evidence remained a
gulf so wide that it seemed impossible
of bridging the detective would have
been utterly discouraged and in fact
had been until eunice gay had sug-
gested a method of getting close to the
suspect without putting him on his
guard what a brick eunice was just
because a girl was engaged to a fellow
was no reason why she should give up
her time and convenience make a sort
of menial of herself and run besides
a possible risk to help her fiance in a
business matter if they succeeded-
well neither of them believed in long
engagements

  just the same it was hard to think
of her up there in that apartment with
a man who was a criminal and who
might become a desperate one if he
should discover the ruse that was being
perpetrated on him

  it was thoughts like these that had
led to the arrangement of the telephone


detective story magazine

signals it was bad enough not to be
able to see eunice at all but he could
at least hear from her every day and
know that all was well with her the
harmless-sounding code which they had
agreed on meant nothing at all except
the single fact that when he heard from
her he could know that she was safe
and unsuspected it had not seemed
feasible to arrange for any elaborate
method of communication when the
girl had any important disclosures to
make or any urgent need of consulting
with him she was to notify maxwell in
advance and manage to get out of the
house and to a public telephone booth
from which she could talk unreservedly
last nights message had been such an
appointment the first that she had made

  george maxwell paused in his pacing
and looked at his watch ten oclock
he frowned nervously for the past
two hours he had stuck close to the of-
fice his ear attuned for the tinkle of
the telephone when eunice had made
the appointment she must have had rea-
son to think that she would be able to
get away to keep it and she had said
ten oclock at the very latest but per-
haps his watch was fast

  the slow measured tones from the
bell of a downtown church came to him
no the watch was not fast but surely
eunice would not fail him after making
so definite an appointment if her plans
had been upset she would feign illness
or manufacture some other excuse to
get to a secluded telephone he knew
that she wtas not one to forget and she
must have information to impart im-
portant information had she in get-
ting it unwittingly exposed herself to
the suspicion of her employer could
anything have happened to her

  as the minutes ticked on george max-
well became more and more nervous
his fears refused to be quieted at
five minutes after ten he sat down at his
desk and lifted the receiver of the tele-
phone it would not be especially dan-

gerous to call up the home of rufus
dodge and ask for miss gay who-
ever answered could have no inkling of
his identity

  he waited patiently while centra rang
the number at last he received her ul-
timatum they dont answer slam-
ming the receiver on its hook he got his
hat and started from the office of
course she might call later but his fears
would brook no delay

  when he reached the riverside drive
apartment house he was in no mood
for diplomacy after all he could pose
as her brother since nobody knew him
here even if the whole plan w-ere
given away it was far more important
to know that eunice was safe than to
succeed in trapping the bond thief

  slipping a coin into the hand of the
uniformed hallboy he asked him to call
up mr dodges apartment

  aint nobody home there boss said
the man

  not home george maxwell felt
a sudden terror hows that
night man says they all done went
off on a trip last night he helped to
carry down their suit cases mister
dodge didnt say where they was going
or when theyd be back

  every one gone asked maxwell
dazedly

  yes suh kind of suddenlike

  with fear at his heart george max-
well rushed from the building danger
indeed why had he ever allowed eu-
nice to enter the place as a governess
to put herself in the power of this man
whom he knew to be a crook  but self-
recriminations would not help now to
the nearest police station he rushed and
told his story his original suspicions of
dodge eunices subterfuge her pres-
ent probable danger cant we get into
the flat he asked breathlessly to try
to find out where theyve gone man
think of that girl weve got to do some-
thing he was exasperated by the
a blocked get-away



indifferent attitude of the lieutenant
who heard his talc

  well said the officer you might
get a search warrant

  then lets get one exclaimed max-
well

  in spite of his frantic efforts
it was nearly an hour later when george
maxwell accompanied by a policeman
secured the key from the superintend-
ent of the building and opened the door
of rufus dodges apartment there
was little in the outer rooms to indicate
anything unusual it was only when
they came into the bedroom of the child
that the empty pulled-out bureau draw-
ers gave evidence of a hurried flight
the other bedrooms presented a simi-
lar appearance no convenient time-
table lay anywhere within sight to give
a clew to the present or intended where-
abouts of the refugees

  in the room which maxwell identi-
fied as eunices there was nothing
which he could possibly construe into
a message for him some of her
dresses and personal belongings were
scattered about the room but he felt
sure that she could not have left vol-
untarily of course it might be pos-
sible to find the taxi driver who had
taken them to the station last night but
that would consume time besides it
was inconceivable that dodge would fail
to cover up the trail before it was many
hours old

  the little study back of the living
room seemed to afford the most promis-
ing clew here was the safe and a
tug at its closed door showed maxwell
that it was locked some scattered re-
ceipts and papers on a table near it led
him to think that the contents of the
strong box had been sorted and some
of them carried away the very furni-
ture of the room seemed to indicate
that a struggle had taken place there
was it here that eunice alone and un-
able to summon help had put up a sin-
gle-handed fight against a criminal made

desperate by the knowledge of discov-
ery george maxwell shuddered in
impotent rage

  she had been here at any rate he
stooped quickly to the floor to pick up
an object which he recognized a num-
ber of childs building blocks were scat-
tered over the carpet in an irregular
semicircular arrangement on top of
one of them was the article he had no-
ticed an engraved platinum bar pin
which he had seen a hundred times at
eunices throat

  he picked it up made sure of its
identification and dropped it into a
pocket his eyes searched the floor for
any other article which might have es-
caped his first scrutiny there was
nothing there nothing but the square
blocks with the letters of the alphabet
on two opposite sides and pictures of
animals on the other four

  suddenly he seemed to see a signifi-
cance in the blocks themselves in their
arrangement every one of them was
turned so that a letter was upward
and the first four letters reading from
the left of the semicircle were gone

  he had an insistent feeling that he
was on the verge of a discovery and he
called the officers attention to what he
saw but the rest of the letters seemed
to make no definite sense it might be
a mere coincidence that every block
had a letter turned upward instead of
a picture and that the first four letters
spelled a word perhaps they had been
thus arranged by the child who had
played with them yet eunice had
been in this room not many hours be-
fore  she might have had an opportu-
nity of arranging the blocks in a way to
signal a meaning to him why it was
from the top of one of the blocks the
fifth one that he had taken her bar pin
and that was scarcely a likely place for
the pin to fall during a struggle had
she left it purposely to attract his at-
tention if so what was the key by
which he could read her message un-


detective story magazine

less the message had been interrupted
before she could complete it

  another detail bore itself in upon his
groping mind unimportant and gro-
tesque it seemed but each block had
one letter stamped in red and the other
in blue and the ones that spelled the
word gone all had their red surfaces
upward

  as quickly as the thought came to
him he stooped and turned over every
block which had a blue letter upper-
most he could scarcely wait until he
had finished to read the result the
red letters now from left to right ran

secret drawers in old casket

hile examining a large casket of great age which was on exhibition re-
cently in london a reporter accidentally drew forth a small hidden drawer
in which lay several metal lockets evidently much older than the casket when
the drawer was completely out of its socket there was observed still another
tiny drawer at the back of it and when this was opened there were found
rarer and smaller lockets to the great surprise and gratification of the owner
of the casket
to paraphrase a remark attributed to lincoln you can please some of the
people all of the time and all of the people some of the time but you
cannot please all of the people all of the time

    take thubway tham for example we thought all of the people liked
tham all of the time save for one exception perhaps we refer to that chap
over in sweden whose letter we printed here in the chat not so long ago
but then he resides in a foreign country far away from the atmosphere in
which tham lives and breathes and has his being so we have never felt that he
really counted as a person who was not pleased

    however here is a fellow m w h he signs himself of fall river
rhode island who certainly smashes up the please-all-of-the-people-all-of-the-time
unity of opinion so far as tham in particular and mccuiley in general are con-
cerned

    just listen to what m w h has to say

    dear editor i cant help wondering how some of your readers and you
can find any merit in johnston mcculleys stories

    of all the absurd and ridiculous stories and characters his are past the
limit thubway tham stories surely are not humorous they are just silly
there is also the spider another silly attempt to be interesting my word
toddle along and what in nearly every paragraph how can any of your
readers find merit or even interest in such rot unless they are kids about twelve
to fifteen years of age either physically or mentally

    mr mccuiley is capable of doing some very fine work if he would stick
to his plots without such absurd characters with their ridiculous mannerisms

    ive forgotten who wrote the black star stories but whoever he was must
be of the same ilk as mr mccuiley can you imagine a more ridiculous and
overdrawn character than the black star can you imagine anything more
absurd and overdrawn than the black stars feats holding up an entire city
was easy

    christopher booths amos clackworthy stories are silly too so far as
the early bird is concerned

    why do not the writers eliminate such foolish characters why do they
spoil their otherwise good stories by such crazy rot that simply bores the reader

    doctor poate is excellent his doctor bentiron stories are wonderfully
written and so far above the attempts of the other writers that there is really
no comparison the umph of doctor bentiron does not occur often enough
to cause the stories to lose their wonderful merit

    the last story by doctor poate was not in any way up to his standard


detective story magazine

for he attempted to create a silly and absurd character in doctor clarence percy
a la mcculley

    tell doctor poate for goodness sake not to spoil his wonderful work by
trying to imitate the poor work of other writers

    permit me to join r m petty in requesting doctor poate to sick doctor
bentiron on to doctor gorham for surely you and doctor bentiron should not
permit the villainy of doctor gorham to be successful nor victorious

    oh yes mr mcculleys valet in the thunderbolt stories is another example
of a silly character why does he insist upon spoiling his stories

    why not some more stories by achmed abdullah he is another fine
writer

    your magazine is splendid but could be wonderfully improved by having
your writers omit such ridiculous characters with their silly sayings

    another silly character-big-nose charley such attempts at humor re-
mind me of the old so-called slapstick comedians

    do you dare print this letter if you do so i believe you will find thou-
sands of your readers agreeing with me i sincerely trust you are not peeved
for my criticism is purely a friendly one and is written with the hope that
you will make your magazine still better for it really is a fine one and i wish
you great success	m w h

    as you all know we have thousands of letters on file praising the tham
stories and mcculleys yarns-letters like this from robert c fuller of no 
riverside drive new york this one just came and was directed to mcculley
himself

    the stories you have given me to read particularly those featuring the
thunderbolt and thubway tham have afforded me much pleasure and enter-
tainment and i want to tell you in a somewhat practical manner just how much
they are enjoyed and appreciated in my home

    it is my custom to read aloud to my wife the thubway tham stories but
in the case of the one in the issue of march th dealing with his operation and
subsequent hallucination i read the story in my wifes temporary absence and
at dinner informed her that tham had been sentenced to be electrocuted for
the murder of craddock

    it is i think no exaggeration to say that she was the most disappointed
woman in new york until i read the story to her when she learned that she
would probably hear more from tham in the future yours truly

                                                 robert c fuller

    but you never can tell can you

    speaking of tham we are getting a lot of letters from anxious readers
who fear the elusive little fellow may up and marry this girl he has fallen for
so hard and if he does they fear he will be cooked and done for just settle
into a staid old head of a family and have no more adventures worth recording

    you know he may get so good he will cease to be interesting-back and forth
to the job a pipe after supper to bed up in morning and back to the job again
just make one entry in the diary and then ditto to the end of the year
headquarters chat



    this is a sample of the letters we are getting

    dear editor  i have taken the detective story magazine for two years
is not that enough to say that i have good taste i received my copy for this
week and have read the story about thubway tham meeting the girl and i
believe i anticipate mr mcculleys motive in writing this story dear editor
wont you please ask mr mcculley-and keep me not in suspense-if he is going
to marry tham off to that girl and make him go straight hoping to see the
answer to this in detective story soon i remain yours in suspense

  louisville nebraska	louis reinhart

    p s-if you quit publishing thams stories you may lose a devoted sub-
scriber	l r

    well we cant help you brother perhaps mcculley can perhaps tham
can perhaps the girl can

    but honest injun we doubt it you know this love disease is a very very
serious malady and it often only too often proves fatal

    come come though lets not get dismal we must all brace up and hope
for the best

intricate robbery by fur thieves

the feat of two thieves who recently robbed vogel white  co inc in
 new york of furs valued at one hundred thousand dollars was an extraor-
dinary one working at night the men lowered themselves and their loot
by a three-hundred-foot rope from an eleven-story window and crossed from
one building to another on a narrow plank far above the ground

    gaining entrance to a building at  west thirty-sixth street by jimmying
a rear window the two crooks made their way to the roof they bridged the
chasm to the eleventh-story window of  west thirty-sixth street with a plank
breaking their way into that floor they proceeded to loot the showroom and
storeroom of vogel white  co

    ten large bags each weighing two hundred pounds and each containing
seal mole caracul leopard muskrat mink persian lamb and squirrel coats were
swung from a rear window to the roof of a four-story building at  west
thirty-seventh street to do this it was necessary for one of the men to lower
himself first while the other held the rope then the bags were let down finally
the man in the loft tied the rope to a radiator pipe in some way he was able
to loosen the rope after he had descended

    after crossing several roofs the crooks used the rope again to lower them-
selves and their loot to the roof of a small extension adjacent to another building
here they jimmied a window and entered with the furs

    at nine a m the janitor of that building was called to a shop on the second
floor there he saw two strangers who seemed very busily engaged moving about
some bags he paid no particular attention to the fact that he had never seen
them before because they appeared to be so much at home

    if you please hold the door open while we carry these bags to the street
said one of the robbers

    willingly the janitor thinking he was helping one of his tenants held the
door open down the stairs and out to the truck went all the bags then
tipping the janitor with a dollar the crooks closed and locked the door and drove
away in an automobile truck

    alexander-a great many of the boys who were overseas for the duration
of the war have written me that they find it difficult to settle down to their former
jobs some of them blame themselves for this and a number blame the jobs
in your case  would consider that your present state of mind is responsible
for your attitude toward your world having been an officer you allowed your-
self to fall into the belief that you would always be one or that you would be
able to give and not take orders for the rest of your life your natural tendency
is to be domineering you know and the taste of power that you have had has
not been especially good for you best thing you can do is to face the situation
squarely own to yourself that this is the trouble and try to take a different
attitude toward everything and everybody including yourself remember this
the finer and better a man is the greater ability he has to obey and to give his
employers respectful attention and loyal service since you like the work itself
strive to put yourself more into accord with all those with whom you are asso-
ciated no i dont think that you are morbid at all i have seen a great many
of our returned men go through with this same process

    f f v-and you my dear have a variation on the problem of alexander
having been brought up to think it a disgrace to work and to believe that you
and your family were a peg above us common mortals you now heartily resent
the fact that life is rapidly demonstrating to you the fallacy of your convictions
now dont think that i dont sympathize with you in your case i can sym-
pathize from a very personal angle having gone through that identical process
myself your nature is excessively proud excessively sensitive excessively
reserved and these qualities have been exaggerated by your home training no
indeed i dont think it a tragedy when a woman has to work i think the tragedy
is when she doesnt and wont your writing shows good taste and unusual
intelligence f f v and it is simply scandalous for you to be whining and
weeping like this at the prospect of having to earn your honest bread you with
those pioneer forefathers and mothers who dared to be the first settlers in that
wild colony of virginia just go and read some of the family records my dear
girl and if you dont blush clear up into your hair youre not the fine woman
at heart that your writing shows you to be

    s g t-your writing reveals a nature which is not sufficiently developed
headquarters cha



as to courage and self-confidence and you are too easily depressed i dont
like the way in which you suddenly drop the last word of each line that shows
a morbid tendency and a lack of physical resistance now let me ask you a
question do you really want to let life beat you how does your pride accept
the idea of defeat have you got enough good red blood in your veins to stand
up like a man and take some blows in a fair fight why of course you have
well then even with what i acknowledge to be a pretty bad condition of affairs
call to your aid all that courage and pride which you have allowed to be beaten
out of sight make up your mind that a mans will is a powerful weapon and
that you are going to use it your character is as i have said undeveloped but
you can do wonders with it in six months if you will only try

    bobby-do you realize that all you have really asked me is how can i
make more money that way of just thinking of money as an end in itself
defeats its own ends what you should ask me is how can i better my
education how can i strengthen my will how can i develop my resources
so that i will not be so affected by every little incident of life your tendency
you see is just to twist and turn and complain while you never really take a step
forward or actually do anything you are not alone in this its what most
people do you really have cleverness of the hand and i have no doubt that
you could learn many worth-while and profitable things but to do so you must
begin at the beginning if i were you i would apprentice myself to a good high-
class dressmaker you would find that you would like the work but you would
have to make up your mind that you would put in at least two years earning less
than you do now after that though you would have a real career before you
in addition to that i earnestly advise you to go to night school

    how on earth you could ever have brought yourself to marry this disagreeable
writer whose extraordinary specimen of writing you inclose i cant imagine
you possess talent which could be used in some such line as that of hotel wrork
for instance plenty of opportunity in such work for a bright well-poised and
self-confident girl like you my advice to you is to turn your face resolutely
to the making of a career for yourself in doing hotel work you would have
to start from perhaps the position of keeper of the linen room in some small
hotel

    c e a-outdoor work by all means you are simply lost in office work


detective story magazine

or routine duties on the other hand you do not seem to have much real self-
confidence or directness of purpose so it may be difficult for you to find any-
thing that will give you a living wage ever think of surveyorship of some of
the phases of work with lumber and so on to find out what such lines really
offer get some of the lumbermens magazines with which any good news dealer
can supply you i note your broad sense of humor and your very human love
of change and interest you are normally friendly but not emotional and unless
the circumstances were exceptionally propitious i would doubt the wisdom of
your marrying unless of course you got a woman of your own temperament
undemonstrative fond of change and even much more reliant and aggressive than
you are yourself

    anna las-i declare anna i dont know just what i ought to say tc
you you really have some of the temperament which is most apt to give success
on the stage but im not entirely sure that you have more than the most mediocre
talent and im absolutely sure that you have hardly a particle of that courage
patience will power and self-control without which those who go on the stage
are foredoomed to ignominious failure

    now consider anna if you really did try to go on the stage i suspect that
you would be able to get some fairly good jobs with road companies and that
that would be about as far as youd get you would be traveling all the time
on little money stopping at fourth-rate hotels never having enough money or
half enough to eat and in the off season be in real danger of starvation unless
your people would take care of you if you can face all that my dear take a
try at it anyway but if you cant for goodness sake keep right on with your
nice little stenographic job one thing i will assert and that is that while by hard
work you may become a good actress you have none of that supreme talent which
gives at least a promise of high success

    bertha-such serious questions of health as you propound should be an-
swered by a physician it is true that i occasionally give advice as to physical
affairs but only in the broadest way and i would never think of even making
suggestions in such a case as yours so far as your character is concerned i
am sure that you have plenty of courage and good sense to keep yourself from
the intense depression which illness often brings remember that the state of
headquarters chat



mind of the patient has a tremendous influence even when an organic disease is
present

    annas friend-where in the world did you get that most amazing tail-
to your y the rest of your writing is rather wild but that one formation is
unusual indeed it shows pride temper and great capacity for jealousy better
look out my dear-with a will which is so capriciously used and with such
emotions flying loose and with no real steadiness of ambition you are one of the
kind who are in danger of making a mess of your life

    dont marry early dont even associate with men if you can bring yourself
to such a life dont read novels study something hard be an athlete
interest yourself in women their problems and interests and make them your
associates if you will do this now in your early years you will develop into
an exceptionally fine woman by the time you are about thirty and then you will
have compensation for your self-denial for you will be popular and magnetic and
with your acquired strength of will you will be sure to have a worth-while life

i	dont often say this sort of thing so please take it most seriously a girl like
you with her intense feelings and rich promises of ardor needs a very prolonged
girlhood if she is not to fall a victim to unhappiness and premature development

    m m c-the specimen on which you want an opinion shows a nature
which is an odd mixture of selfishness and fineness of feelings i dont wonder
that you are in doubt what to think about this person the impulses and con-
victions for instance are really good but the opinions as to surface things are
exceedingly variable and the disposition is so changeable that no dependence
could be placed upon the same mood appearing once in a day if you are think-
ing of marrying this person as your letter would seem to indicate i entreat you
not to do so for the present wait test your own feelings with your sta-
bility of character your logical mind and your lack of imagination i am afraid
that a year of marriage with this writer would drive you to distraction at
least wait until you are sure that you love this writer love when real and
not an infatuation often endures much and is less affected than one would expect
of strange matings

    uriel b-i dont like your partner at all and dont wonder that you fail
to get on with him you are possessed of a broad liberal mind of pleasant re-
actions to the world and of a fair amount of business vision whereas he is a
chronic grouch is narrow-minded and can see just about as far ahead of him
in a business way as the end of his own nose apart from the disagreeableness
of the association there is no hope for business success in two people trying

to work together undersuch conditions if i were you i wouldnt care whether
he was displeased with me for getting out or not his actions show that he
is interested in you for selfish reasons only and from his handwriting i know
that it would be the rarest possible thing for him to be interested in anything
or any one from any other motive besides you would be far better off without
a partner for that matter so would he

    samuel f-decidedly mechanical samuel decidedly dont let anybody
shove you into clerical work where you will be a nonentity go right into

is more try to train yourself into the power to concentrate at present thats

canaries as a side line

europe has a great deal to teach us especially as to small thrifts here
in america our tendency is to depend on the main industry or on the
main income of the family as brought in by the father

    in europe even the smallest children have some little occupation which not
only is an interest and an education but is a source of profit as well some little
time ago i wrote of the possibilities of mushrooms as a financial side line and
the great number of inquiries which i immediately received by mail showed me
that there is a great and growing interest in such possibilities

    the breeding of canaries and the training of them for the market is work
which can be done by any intelligent boy or girl over we will say the age of
twelve while women physically unfitted for work outside the home or wishing
as so many do to add to the income of their husbands would find it fascinating
as well as profitable

    in a country home a porch can be screened with wire netting and provided
with awnings in the usual manner six to eight feet square floor space and
not less than eight feet high would suffice for ten males and thirty females
which is the usual proportion the floor should be whitewashed and a number
of perches drinking pans and gravel pans provided

    a nest for each female and about six over must be arranged as some will
be capricious changing from one to another before getting suited these nests
can be bought from dealers at a very moderate price they are of woven wire and
headquarters chat



sometimes of tin pierced with small holes for ventilation and they should be
placed at various elevations against the house wall

    a piece of cuttle bone firmly tied to a corner with a small perch on which
the birds can stand when pecking at it is a necessity as it contains minerals
that they need  lettuce wild pepper grass a few crusts of bread and once in a
while a bone with a little fresh meat on it will help to make sturdy birds but
feeding of bits of cake and other odd things is most injurious and will not only
cause disease but often death

    birds reared in such an open-air home will be very sturdy and the loss
of the young will be slight if pains are taken to keep that part of the house quiet
and that no sudden noises no strangers and no animals are allowed anywhere
near heavy curtains of awning cloth should be attached to the outside of the
porch up under the eaves they are kept rolled up during the day but pulled
down and securely fastened at night except during the hottest weather they
are also used to darken the porch when the young ones begin to be taught their
songs as birds should listen to their instructors in a shaded place

    the instructor is a matured male singer who is kept out of hearing of the
young birds until the day when they are taken from their mothers hmvever
the best plan is to take the mothers away from them leaving them to acquire
their education in the first home the mothers will be all the better off for a
short period of rest before going into the breeding of the seasons second batch

    when the instructor is to be brought to the youngsters his cage should be
kept quite dark until he is wanted take him into the room from which the
porch opens darken the porch by pulling down the outside awnings place his
cage in the full light and take off the cover the result will be at least an hour of
brilliant song especially if the sun is shining brightly

    the performance must be repeated day after day the young birds soon
beginning to imitate the teachers simpler strains at this jeriod the keeper
should listen very carefully to the performances and as soon as it is apparent
that two or three are the best singers of promise they should be put in another
place by themselves and the first and best moments of the teacher should be
given to them for they are the ones which will produce the real artists and
will consequently bring the largest prices

    good vigorous hen canaries kept in such an open-air home or transferred
to it as soon as the weather is suitable will bring off three nests each season
without harm to themselves and may be active breeders for four or five years as
the nests have from four to six eggs and as infant canaries are not really as
difficult to raise as young turkeys the amount of profit to be derived from the
number suggested-thirty females and ten males-will be by no means a light
matter especially after the first year
