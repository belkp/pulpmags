 i sore throjt see how quickly listerine relieves it dont put up with the pain of ordinary sore throat it is so unnecessary at the first symptom of trouble gargle with listerine just as it comes from the bottle youll be
delighted by the result

 often one gargle is enough to relieve
that tight raw burning feeling if relief is
not immediate repeat the gargle at  hour
intervals usually two or three applications
of listerine are sufficient

  listerine gets results because it is first of
all a powerful though safe antiseptic which
attacks millions of germs on mouth and

throat surfaces tests have shown that when
used as a gargle listerine reaches far beyond
the soft palate into the posterior pharynx
where sore throat frequently starts

  keep listerine handy in home and office
and use it full strength at the first symp-
tom of a cold or sore throat lambert

 space traveling

           by t oconor sloane phd

taking the circumference of the
earth as  miles an airplane
could accomplish the journey in
about four days if it were not for stops
for refueling and other requirements
this is about three days and there is
little doubt that some similar and equiva-
lent record will be made after a few
years the practicability of refueling an
airplane in flight has been called upon in
several duration-record flights and the
system employed in these flights could
be used for an around the world trip

  there is only one record to break and
it is a fictitious one--it is eighty days the
period of jules vernes novel around
the world in eighty days picturing
nearly a twelve week trip as a fictitious
record breaker we cannot imagine
months to circumnavigate the globe in
an airplane it seems that there is a
good opportunity for a twentieth cen-
tury jules verne to write a story of
around the world in eighty hours
to make a good story he should not

touch terra firma during his trip he
might even tow a glider bearing supplies
of oil and fuel to carry him over long
stretches of ocean this would of course
interfere with his speed but would keep
him supplied with fuel the record
will be made sooner or later

  in the pacific ocean the sailing ships
depended to a great extent on the trade
winds these blew in an unchanging
direction sometimes for days at a time
and the captain would often take his
ship hundreds of miles out of the course
so as to escape the minor almost major
calamity that used to befall sailing ships
the dead calm we read of calms of
over a month in duration when a corked
empty bottle thrown over the side one
day would be still there twenty-four
hours afterwards

 the american commander matthew
fontaine maury carried out exhaustive
researches on ocean winds and currents
but his work of such value but a few
years ago is losing its importance as


amazing stories

sails are supplanted by coal and oil
fuel in boilers and by combustion en-
gines

  an exactly parallel problem or series
of problems has been studied out for
the air pilot and air navigator a strong
head wind may cut his speed down to
half what it should be it is not pos-
sible to utilize the knowledge of air for
application to airplane courses as has
been done for the winds and currents
of the ocean for sailing ships because
like steamers and motor ships the air-
plane has to take a definite course and
follow it pretty closely the sailing
ship of old days with its ability to sail
nearly within forty-five or fifty degrees
of an adverse wind could often welcome
a head wind as being better than none
but the airplane like the steamer fol-
lowing its course and watching for land-
ing fields does no tacking but goes
right ahead it is subject to all sorts of
changes in the wind especially if it is
flown low at a sufficient height these
changes in some measure disappear so
that an almost comparatively even atmos-
phere may prevail professor piccard
who has studied the subject and made
ascensions of ten miles or more claims
that the stratosphere at ten miles or
greater elevation is the place for air
travel of the future comparatively little
change in air currents are present there
and if rocket propulsion is developed
the relative efficiency owing to the rare-
faction of the air would be high the
propulsion by propeller might not be so
good as nearer the surface it is also
somewhat of a problem how the wings
would operate in such low pressure to
support the airplane the air at ten
miles elevation can be used by a plane
but it is uncertain as to its economy

  it almost seems as if it were time to
develop a new type of flying machine
to operate in a partial vacuum in an
atmosphere of very low pressure

  the physiological aspect of the case
is yet to be satisfactorily studied beebe
has gone down into the ocean in his
bathysphere he needed no clumsy
divers suit heavy helmet and leaden
soled shoes for stratosphere flying a
cabin hermetically sealed with oxygen
supply and air purifying and air condi-
tioning should take the place of the cum-
brous helmet and personal equipment of
the high-altitude flyer the passengers
if there were such should be taken care
of by the sealed cabin

  a very curious point is brought out
by comparing the range of mans travel
vertical with horizontal an ocean trip
around the world twenty or thirty thou-
sand miles is now an ordinary thing
miles mean little on land or sea in hori-
zontal travelling but when man at-
tempts vertical travel it is different it
is fair to call three hundred feet the
extreme limit for a diver in his suit
this is really more than is practical

  but even three hundred feet the dis-
tance a runner can traverse in ten sec-
onds is a trivial affair in feet and inches
to attain a hitherto unfathomable
layer of ocean the beebe bathysphere
already alluded to was constructed and
a depth of about  feet was tri-
umphantly atained this seems an
insignificant distance but the pressure
of the water gives a condition far from
a similar characterization the pressure
on the beebe bathysphere if we multiply
its superficial area in inches by  or
 lbs gives the range of pressure
the metal has to resist man could go
to an indefinite depth in the ocean were
it not for the high pressure

  there is a mountain in the himalayas
a fraction over five and a half miles in
height we can call this little more than
an hours walk on the level for a high
grade pedestrian but we have seen that
man is a very poor vertical traveller with
the assistance of porters to carry his out-
space traveling



fit making one camp after another on the
mountain and using oxygen for breath-
ing he has never yet reached the top by
climbing and several lives have been
sacrificed in attempts to achieve this
useless tour de force in english this
stunt for that is all that it amounts to

  with an airplane or a balloon pro-
vided with special appliances to protect
him from the low pressure and temper-
ature changes man can ascend to over
twice this height

  man can only slightly change his al-
titude his range is ten or eleven miles

  the best he has ever done is sup-
posed to be about eleven miles the
heights reached by balloon or airplane
are determined by the registration of a
barograph which registers air pressure
and whose readings of air pressure are
taken as convertible into miles and frac-
tions of height this is the best that
can be done for triangulation of objects
at that height cannot be carried out from
the surface of the earth it would seem
quite possible to triangulate from the
car of a balloon to base marks on the
surface of the earth and this would at
least be an approximation to a definite
result the inaccuracy of the barograph
is due principally to the fact that air
pressure is subject to local variations
an approximate method of correction
for this source of error is to take re-
peated readings of the air pressure on
the ground during the ascent one bar-
ometer-reading every hour would be
pretty good practise but then the trou-
ble is that the variations in atmospheric
pressure at the surface of the earth
might and probably would be different
from those existing at an elevation

  the endeavor to attain great eleva-
tions has had its tragedies in mountain
climbing where ten thousand or fifteen
thousand feet is a fair distance to be
climbed mount everest has had a num-
ber of deaths to its credit or more prop-

erly to its discredit but it has never
been climbed

  the ascending into the stratosphere
with a partially inflated balloon has had
a very high percentage of victims al-
though so few have attempted it an
old time theory of ballooning was that
the balloon if it lost its gas would act
as a parachute but this has not held
good in stratosphere ascensions the
balloon did not act as a parachute in the
fatal accidents which occurred recently

  the balloon for these ascensions is
only partly filled as it ascends the
hydrogen expands as the air pressure
diminishes so that as it reaches the
limit of its ascent it may be filled and
become globular or spherical in shape
in the pictures published of the start or
just before it the balloon is shown only
partially filled when fully inflated as
the atmospheric pressure falls at ten
miles or more elevation it would be a
gigantic sphere or spheroid

  the question of going in an air plane
or in some machine out into space be-
yond the limits of the atmosphere is a
curious one there are many people
who firmly believe that man will yet fly
through th wastes of outer space and
visit the moon and some of the planets
mars seems to be the most attractive
because it is one of the nearer planets
when in conjunction with the earth
that is when on the same side of the
sun as the earth and in line with the
sun and the earth this is called in-
ferior conjunction in astronomical ter-
minology in this condition it is some-
times only  miles from the
earth about  times as far as the moon
is from us mars is much smaller
than the earth and probably very frigid
because of its distance from the sun
about one and a third times as far as
the earth is from the great luminary
venus about seven-tenths as far from
the sun as is the earth is so protected


amazing stories

by a mantle of clouds that it may not
be so torrid as might be supposed venus
is nearly as large as our earth

  so much then for the two most hope-
ful planets the moon destitute of
atmosphere and of water is hopeless
an airplane could not be considered to
transport us even to the moon because
the greater part of the space intervening
between our earth and the moon is prac-
tically a vacuum we have to picture
a reaction machine if it had power
enough to average a speed of a thousand
miles an hour it would reach our satel-
lite in about ten days

  there would be a considerable delay
at the start and landing as only a lim-
ited acceleration positive or negative
could be endured by the human system
it would take some time to start from
rest and acquire a velocity of  miles
per hour this velocity would have to
be parted with before landing but
what could man do if chilly mars or
cloudy venus were his destination the
time of his journey might run into
years

  to speak of the temperature of a
vacuum seems to involve a contradiction
in terms space is almost a vacuum
a body in space would be subject to
the heat radiated from the sun this
in a degree applies to any object in the
stratosphere and the action of the heat
radiated from the sun without an ade-
quate blanket of air was one of the
factors provided for by the aeronauts

  it would require at a speed of 
miles an hour four or five years for an

interplanetary trip to the nearest of our
planetary neighbors

  a light-second is the length or dis-
tance of  miles it is the dis-
tance light travels in one second now
multiply this by the seconds in a year
and we will have the light-year alpha
centanri is about four and three-tenths
light-years distant we suggest to ar-
dent advocates of interstellar travel to
calculate the time required to visit our
nearest stellar neighbor the first star of
the celestial centaur alpha centauri

   for terrestrial measurements and for
those in the solar orbit the mile is a
convenient unit but to obtain a real-
ization of stellar distance units we may
reduce some distances in our orbit to
light-second s the moon is distant from
us a little over one and a quarter light
seconds the sun nearly five hundred of
the same unit of distance a light-
second is for us upon the earth an ex-
tremely long unit by which to measure
distances

  but this does not suffice for stellar
measurements for them the unit is the-
light-year the seconds in a year multi-
plied by the velocity of light nearly
 times the distance from the earth
to the sun and the nearest star is over
four times this distance from the earth

  the enterprising space traveller would
have to contemplate travelling over bil-
lions of light-seconds through space to
reach our celestial neighbors outside of
the solar orbit and the light-second
verges on two hundred thousand miles
 in length

please listen

  warren bancroft was sitting on the
swinging balcony of a building in one
of the sky-cities of saturn across from
him lounging gracefully on soft cushions
of tula down was nita the beautiful sa-
turnian who he hoped would some day
be his wife as the communiograph
spoke its blue screen lit up with the image
of the announcer warren was about to
switch the instrument off for what cares
a young man in love for the dull dis-
courses of the learned body of five
hundred who ruled the million worlds
of interstellar space indeed he felt
there were more important things to talk
of under the spell of the four jewels of

saturn shining brightly in the night sky
but the next words of the speaker froze
warrens hand in its course towards the
switch froze it as his mind riveted itself
upon those words that sounded so strange
yet so significant

fte have just received a report
 y from professor ru va excavat-
ing under the auspices of the archeo-
logical foundation on the extinct planet
earth in the system of star r-kn oth-
erwise known as sun as known to all
listeners no trace of former civilization
has heretofore been found on earth de-
spite the allegation of those who claim
to be descendants of earth people

  but now professor va communio-
graphs that in the region of  latitude
north and  longtitude west a subter-
ranean disturbance pushed an ancient
mountain ridge up through the tremen-
dously heavy sheet of ice that covers the
entire surface of the extinct planet some

  saturn has nine moons all of which are not of
course visible from any one point on the planet they
range in sie from  to  miles in diameter their

he left the cave cautiously making sure that there was no saturnian any-
where in sight then signalled a passing ball-taxi and instructed the operator

to drive him to nitas dwelling
earth rehabilitators consolidated	

strange metallic objects and a plate of
what is probably ancient earth-writing
have been found and it is stated that
warren turned suddenly towards nita
for the first time in years his eyes shone
with hope and his chin became firm with
determination as he exclaimed

  the very spot where gordon ban-
croft my illustrious earth ancestor had
his research laboratory 

  warren was excited he listened in-
tently to the message his eyes taking in
the beauty of nita but his thoughts
carrying him to the distant planet from
which he was reported to have descended
many thousands of years ago the
speaker told of the difficulties under
which professor ru va and his gallant
group had labored during years of re-
search upon the icy planet and how they
had courageously faced hardships and
disappointments until now they reached
th culmination of their ambition but
the speaker gave no further details of
the actual discovery the information he
had was too meagre he must wait for
further dispatches from the expedition

for many years warren bancroft had
smarted under the haughty treatment
accorded him by the saturnians here
on this planet the caste system was very
rigidly observed particularly despised
was that small group of white skinned
people who claimed descent from the
earth true many had intermarried with
saturnians plutonians and the peoples
from other planets throughout the solar
systems thereby losing their identity and
tell-tale appearance but the pride of the
most rugged of these men and women
did not permit them to marry outside of
their own race therefore warren like a
handful of others was a true-blooded
earthman

then for many years ever since he
had read of the great discovery in

gordon bancrofts neatly written notes
the dream of rehabilitating the earth had
been an impelling force that would not
let him rest a tremendous yes almost
a hopeless task-how could he and a
small band of earthmen haunted by the
fear of persecution ever achieve such a
magnifident ambition the secret of
gordon bancrofts great discovery had
lain buried under thousands of tons of
ice on earth but now warrens hopes
leaped high for professor ru va was
excavating in that very region could he
warren bancroft lineal descendant of
the famous gordon go to earth and find
the formula for super-atmosphere that
wonderful substance that would convert
the baser nature of man  and then could
he restore the atmosphere to his native
planet and start anew a civilization more
magnifident than it had ever enjoyed
it was a noble dream a seemingly im-
possible dream to give back to the de-
scendants of earthmen the planet earth

and then too he could marry nita
without question whereas now he
stood but little chance she was the daugh-
ter of the famous professor of astronom-
ical physics v-si in the present day
world scientists were regarded as the aris-
tocracy they were the rulers of all the
planets while merchants were treated no
better than slaves creatures who had to
be tolerated because they did the menial
tasks which were necessary even in a
highly mechanized state of existence
and all earthmen were considered the
descendants of a race of merchants
therefore they were looked upon as
slaves

  oh i am so glad warren nita
looked at him radiantly now if they
only discover gordons notes in the ruins
of his laboratory you can prove your
claim to noble lineage

  that is true he reflected slowly
looking off far over the moonlit


amazing stories

landscape beyond the horizon where a
pale dot of light marked his beloved
planet earth then he turned suddenly
to nita his eyes gleaming with determ-
ination

  no it will not do to wait for some-
one else to find the formula of the
great discovery i must go and seek
for it myself and then with that knowl-
edge in my possession make the earth
habitable so that we may be freed from
this cursed persecution

  the girl glanced up at him quickly
and saw by his tightly compressed lips
and the angle of his jaw that he was in
deadly earnest

  if any one can do it you can war
ren  have high hopes for your suc-
cess

  and then nita

  for an answer she snuggled into his
arms and looked into his eyes with an
expression that required no words to
interpret

the following morning an earnest
group of men huddled around the
blue flames of the vapor fire in a clev-
erly concealed cavern just outside of
the saturnian sky-city of irru they
were the loyal clan of descendants of
earthmen under the leadership of ross
griffin staunch friend of warren ban-
croft warren had just finished read-
ing from the diary of gordon ban-
croft his listeners sat spellbound
with their own eyes they were seeing
the last remaining bits of forbidden
earth-writing they admired warren
for his courage in bringing this docu-
ment here for even to speak of such
things meant death in the horrible
chamber of purple vapor

  its true warren ross griffin in-
terceded that professor ru va might
discover the secret formula of your an-
cestor but the information would prob-
ably be misused by our enemies so that

it would be of scant benefit to us to
tell the truth life here is discouraging
if we were only given a free hand we
could show these people that we are
just as capable of developing new sci-
entific wonders as they are themselves

  warren bancroft rose to his feet
an eager light crept into his eyes and
the yellow pages of the precious diary
rustled as his hand trembled with emo-
tion he could not express

  i was just coming to that point
ross for many years we have yearned
for the freedom of our native planet
we have planned and schemed with a
hope of rehabilitating the earth a hope
that we feared could never be realized
when we attempted to reach the ears of
the body of five hundred what hap-
pened we were laughed at scorned
despised by these saturnians true we
have gained many friends among them
but they too were afraid to help us al-
ways they shook their heads regretfully
and said if you could only prove your
descent from the nobility of scicn-e
tists   

  now we have our opportunity the
expedition of professor ru va may or
may not find those valuable documents
we can not afford to take that chance
we must go to earth now at once even
though it means slaying those who op-
pose us then when we return with the
formula and our plans for rehabilitating
the earth i am sure that we can gain the
help of the body of five hundred

  warren glanced at his listeners their
eyes were shining with anticipation an
eagerness to be doing something any-
thing that would free them from bond-
age on this foreign planet he con-
tinued explaining his proposition fully
stirring their enthusiasm with visions
of a new world

  that is the reason that i asked
ross to call this meeting we have gath-
ered many times before but each time
earth rehabilitators consolidated



there was some insurmountable ob-
stacle in our way we can no longer
procrastinate

  i am going to earth to get gordons
formula to which i am entitled i am
calling upon you fellows for help are
you with me

it is last words were drowned by a
 chorus of wild cheering every
man rushed to warren to offer his ser-
vices these earthmen long oppressed
and scorned by everyone now saw a
ray of hope the possession of the
formula for super-atmosphere would
give them vast power they would be
masters of a valuable process and
could bargain with the rulers of the
universe for almost anything they
wanted it was no wonder that the
thing gripped their imaginations no
wonder that they volunteered to a man
to go on a journey that would be ex-
tremely hazardous

  they sat down and began to discuss
their plans more rationally several
knotty problems had to be solved the
most difficult one was the means of ob-
taining a space ship as earthmen were
not permitted to own property of any
kind and were only allowed to travel
from one planet to another through the
sanction of the interstellar police of-
fice and there was no air line be
tween saturn and earth only an occa-
sidonal exploration ship journeyed to
that extinct planet

  getting a space ship is not an easy
task warren admitted but i have a
plan that might vork ill see you fel-
lows later

chapter ii

he left the cave cautiously mak-
ing sure that there was no
saturnian anywhere in sight
then signalled a passing ball-taxi and in-

structed the operator to drive him to
nitas dwelling the giant sphere rolled
away at a terrific speed and lifted itself
from the ground to hurtle through the
air until it was eased down on the land-
ing roof at its destination

  warren told the tall martian who
stood guard outside of nitas door that
he wanted to see his mistress the man
glared at him but there was something
in warrens steady blue eyes and his
determined bearing that caused the red-
faced man to bow stiffly and disappear
inside when he returned he held the
door open and motioned the earthman
to enter

  the chamber into which he was ush-
ered was high and hung with dark flex-
ible metal draperies that gave a musical
rustle as they swung rhythmically to
and fro the room was illuminated by
a faint greenish phosphorescence from
the ceiling he blinked his eyes in the
weird half-light and peered into the
gloom the draperies at the other end
of the chamber parted and nita entered
she looked as beautiful as ever to his
hungry eyes but as she stretched out
her arms to him he noticed with a feel-
ing of dismay that she had been crying

  why what has happened nita you
appear depressed

  i have just had a talk with father
-about my-about our plans and   
oh warren she laid her head against
his shoulder and sobbed as if her heart
would break he does not understand
although he likes you well enough he is
so afraid of denying gurra

  then she straightened up and took a
firm grip upon herself and stamped her
tiny feet and i hate that ugly-faced
plutonian

gurra coal black with a gnarled
and malformed body had risen to
power soon after he emigrated from the
planet pluto he was made director of


amazing stories

the hall of space research on saturn
where nitas father taught although
the elderly professor v-si harbored no
love for the ugly faced gurra still he
dared not oppose him when the plu-
tonian began calling at his home os-
tensibly to see him the professor felt
honored but as time went on he dis-
covered that the real lure was his daugh-
ter he was horrified by the thought
and tried to make himself believe that
the malformed gurra would not have
the heart to ruin the life of a fine girl
like nita who could never learn to love
him but the plutonian approached
him in his laboratory and with a beastly
smile told him that he was going to
marry nita and that professor v-si
should inform her at once the pro-
fessors feeble remonstrance did not
avail him of anything so to-day just
before warren came to see her nita
had been given the revolting news

  warren did his best to soothe her but
his heart was heavy he had hardly the
courage to tell her of his latest plans
the one ray of hope he had was to en-
list the aid of her father in fitting out an
expedition to find the formula but
now this course was impossible for a
moment he felt discouraged felt that
life was futile but his old confidence
soon came back and he vowed to see
it through and fight until the bitter end

before he could begin the story
of what had taken place that morn-
ing in the council of the faithful earth-
men the musical rustling of the draper-
ies became harshly discordant as they
were rudely torn aside something hob-
bled into the room they looked but
could see no one nita with a low cry
of terror turned a knob at her elbow
the green phosphorescent glow was in-
stantly replaced by a brilliant red light

  there standing against the black
draperies was the blacker form of

gurra warren had never met the
man before but he recoiled at the sight
of the ugly face the red bulging eyes
and the malformed body of the crea-
ture that stood leering at him every
line on his face seemed to express a
harsh savage manner

  the man spoke his voice was high
pitched and grating his thick lips
moved in a grimace and his short homy
arms and talon fingers gesticulated
meaninglessly

  earth-slave out of here back to
your bargaining and bickering with the
other slaves do you hear me i have
seen enough of your kind

  warrens lips were bloodless so tight-
ly compressed were they he clenched
his fists until the nails cut deeply into
the palm of his hand

  nita wait outside please he im-
plored the terrified girl

  no no warren you must not you
can not afford to jeopardize your plans
at this time

  gurra you know that i could crush
your ugly body we earthmen have
stood enough from your kind but i
have better use for you right now

  and warren strode over to the crea-
ture and before the plutonian could
reach for his tube of purple death-gas
he pinioned his arms although the sharp
talons cut cruelly into the flesh of his
body the black lips opened to scream
but warren drove his clenched fist into
the mans mouth which effectively si-
lenced all further attempts

tisten now nitawarrens breath
- came in gasps as his excitement
mounted this is my chance before
this monster broke in upon us i tried
to tell you all of our plans our group
you know whom i mean met this morn-
ing and we decided that it would be ab-
solutely necessary for us to go to earth
at once there is more to the story
earth rehabelitators consolidated	

which i dare not tell you with this lis-
tening he indicated the cowering
gurra

  the one big thing that confronts us
is the means of getting to the icy planet
when i came here i had all intentions
of appealing to your father for help but
now i see that it is impossible no i
did not mean to offend you nita his
voice became soft as he saw the hurt
expression in her eyes i realize how
he feels he is powerless to help

  but this creature gave me an idea
i am going to use his space ship my
men are all ready they are waiting for
me at the cave come you and he
shook the black plutonian give me the
combination of your hangar lock and
tell me where you keep the ship

  let me help you warren i can go
and inform your men nita was quite
determined she had made up her
mind to place her future in the hands
of this earthman who meant everything
to her

  no you must not do that he will
only avenge himself on you

  he might but he will have to catch
me first warren i am going on this
journey with you i am going to
earth

  warren could not have been more as-
tonished than if she had said that she
was about to fly to the distant black star
urma then he thrilled with secret
adoration he was proud to know that
she thought so much of him that she
would undergo the untold dangers and
hardships of such a journey but he
shook his head sadly and reluctantly

  im afraid that it cant be done
nita nothing would please me more
under different circumstances but
now 

  please dont argue with me she
stamped her little foot determinedly i
am going would you leave me behind
with that 

she pointed to gurra who was
staring at them evilly his moutt
wide open as his mind slowly graspei
the significance of the drama that was
taking place then he flushed with
anger and waved his short homy arms
at nita

  you cant go you cant go he half
pleaded half bullied in a croaking
voice

  warren drew back his clenched fist
and the man cowered to the floor and
said no more

  warren we have no time to lose
tell me where to go and i will have
your friends prepare to leave saturn
immediately i know where gurra
keeps his ship and he has told me the
combination father and i have gone
on several short trips with him and he
has even shown me how to handle the
controls

  the descendant of earthmen thought
seriously about the new angle of the
situation then the furrows on his
brow smoothed out and he smiled hap-
pily at the courageous girl

  i hardly dared to expect this nita
but now that you are firmly determined
to go with us i must confess that i am
overjoyed there are many dangers
but im afraid that there would be
many more if you remained behind
and he looked significantly at gurra

  he pushed the black man into a cor-
ner from which he could not escape and
drew nita out of earshot here in a
low voice he rapidly sketched his entire
plan and gave her explicit directions for
finding the earthmen

ave ross griffin direct the men
you might ask him to send palm-
er to me at once at the hangar so that
we may prepare the space ship but be-
for you go hadnt you better pack your
personal belongings-we are not com-
ing back here ill be waiting for you


amazing stories

at the hangar a sudden idea came to her

  what are you planning to do with
that she indicated in the direction of
the plutonian

  there are several things i would
like to do with him but for the time
being ill just put him to sleep right
where he is no it will not be any-
thing serious he assured her when he
saw the questioning look on the girls
face he will wake up after we are
gone without being much worse off for
his long sleep

  immediately after nita had finished
her packing and had left the building
warren removed a small metallic tube
from a pocket in his garment and
pointed it at the terrified gurra the
creatures red eyes bulged with fear but
before he could open his lips to squeal
the bluish vapor reached his dilated nos-
trils and his head fell back upon the
hard floor he lay there unconscious
with mouth wide open black fangs pro-
truding in an ugly satanic grin

  warren wasted no time he picked
up nitas belongings and hurried in the
direction of the hangar he was cau-
tious to avoid the terrible vigilantes
whose deadly fire-spears had snuffed
out the life of more than one poor earth-
man for very little or no reason

chapter iii

fortunately gurras space
ship was housed in a secluded part
of the sky-city and he reached it
without arousing any suspicion re-
membering the combination nita had
given him he pushed a series of tiny
buttons whereupon the entire cover
panel of the hanger slid open noiselessly
at his feet revealing below the shining
metallic vehicle that was to carry the
little band of earthmen and one loyal
and lovely saturnian girl to the cold
regions of an extinct planet

  warren stepped down and began a
hasty inspection of the flyer nita hd
told him that it was propelled by a new
gas mixture that had a nozzle velocity
many times in excess of the vapors used
in the motors of the old style shipg the
rocket tubes appeared to be sound they
showed but little pitting and would be
good for many long flights before they
needed replacing as he was about to
step inside of the space ship he heard
the sound of voices above him and
looking up he saw nita accompanied
by ross griffin and x palmer both
men were carrying with some difficulty
several heavy parcels and metal tanks
thats fast work warren ross
called down to his friend cheerfully
getting a ship on such short notice
before nita rounded us up ill confess
that i was a bit skeptical about having
the good fortune to be able to rocket off
to the earth palmer and i picked up
these tanks of liquid gas in case gurras
ship was short of fuel and god
knows where we will have to go before
we are through with this journey
where are the other fellows war-
ren asked after they had entered the
ship and x palmer was beginning
methodically to test the propelling and
control apparatus

phey are coming one by one to
a allay suspicion theres vic syl-
van now ross replied as a blond-
haired young giant stepped quietly
through the airlock to greet them

  the remaining members of warren
bancroft s crew of earthmen appeared
shortly after coming in one by one all
of them carrying provisions and sup-
plies that had been stored for just such
an eventuality their eyes which were
once dull and glazed now lit up with the
sparkle and anticipation of adventure

  counting nita and warren there were
eleven people in the crew and on the
earth rehabilitators consolidated	

passenger list of the earthbound
as the plutonians ship had been re-
named by its new masters-eleven peo-
ple united by the common bond of earth
ancestry and for the common purpose
of establishing for themselves and for
their families the privileges and esteem
which they believed should rightfully
be theirs

  warren and his crew wasted no time
on idle sentimentalism there was work
to be done delay might prove fatal to
their plans at any moment gurra or
the vigilantes might pounce upon them
and not only would their plans be
balked but they would all most certain-
ly be subject to the tortures of the
horrible purble vapor and if unlucky
enough to have remained alive be ex-
iled to a living hell on saturns farthest
satellite phoebe

  nita donned a mechanics garment
and accompanied palmer about the con-
trol and power rooms checking the
motors the tubes the instruments the
controls and in fact every vital part of
the earthbound she had inherited
much of the scientific and mechanical
talent from her father for more than
once palmer conceded some mooted
point to her and cheerfully followed her
suggestions warren in the meantime
was studying the celestial charts and
plotting their angle of projection

in order to take off with the assur-
ance that they would be headed to-
wards the earth it was necessary to es-
timate the proper elevation of the ships
nose as well as its lateral direction
otherwise much valuable fuel would be
expended energizing the steering rock-
ets the ship rested upon an adjustable
cradle which could be rotated and ele-
vated as required to point the ship to-
ward any spot in the heavens verniers
with micrometer graduations enabled the
navigator to place the vessel in its

proper position before the take-off this
universal adjustment was similar to the
polar and declination axes of a tele-
scope mounting which permits the in-
strument to be directed to any point in
the sky

warren was just completing the
final adjustments on the quadrant
when he saw the interior of the hangar
suddenly enveloped in darkness he
looked up in alarm the roof of the
hangar was closing then he heard the
shrill voices of saturians and louder
than any others and more grating
came the voice of gurra warren hav-
ing heard it once could not mistake it
they were trapped the crafty plu-
tonian had awakened from his stupor
prematurely and had called out the vig-
ilantes

  it would have been better if i had
finished him completely warren
thought bitterly as he gave a final twist
to the turntable control before dashing
for the open door of the air lock the
door was fifty feet away an easy sprint
would bring him there in a few seconds
but those seconds may as well have been
hours for the lower entrance to the
hangar between himself and the ship
was now alive with rushing vigilantes
before he could retreat they were upon
him fortunately the entrance was too
narrow to permit more than a limited
number of them through and warren
in desperation struck about him with
the long heavy sighting tube he had
been using in adjusting the cradle

  the skull of the first saturnian who
reached him was crushed the second
vigilante drew back with a cry of pain
as his long arm dangled broken and use-
less the others seeing that here was
no easy conquest circled around him
cautiously waiting for an opening

  the tumult of the attack had at-
tracted the attention of the men on


amazing stories

board of the earthbound  when
ross griffin heard it he took one look
through the observation window and
shouted to the crew vic sylvans
blond head was the first to emerge from
the ship there was a long gleaming
metal rod in his hand as big around as
his massive arm his eyes shone with
the fierce light of battle with a roar
he was upon the astonished vigilantes
and before they could recover from
their surprise three of them were lying
lifeless upon the smooth metal floor of
the hangar

tjere right here with you mr

   v bancroft and by god were
sticking    and fighting    while
theres a kick in us

  the descendant from ancient vikings
paused in his speech every time he ren-
dered another vigilante hors de combat

  by now the little band of earthmen
had joined their two comrades and it
was a matter of just a few moments
and some lusty blows before those sat-
urnians who were able to run took
to their heels and fled in panic crushing
and clawing one another in a desperate
effort to squeeze through the narrow
exit of the hangar

  come boys we havent a minute to
lose if we dont take off at once they
will annihilate us with a fire-ball never
mind trying to open the roof now he
called to palmer as the grim little en-
gine expert was attempting to start the
hangar motors well crash through

back in the control room as soon
as they were all aboard and the
door was tightly sealed warren palmer
and nita worked frantically to start the
repulsion rocket motors as the gases
hissed into the mixing chamber warren
watched the pressure gauge anxiously
would the needle never reach the red
mark he was afraid to fire the

rocket blast before the gases were suffi-
ciently compressed for not only must
the huge metal ship be given sufficient
impetus to overcome the pull of grav-
ity but it must burst through the mas-
sive chromite sheets of the hanger roof
panels the seconds were like hours
not a single voice broke above the hiss-
ing of the gas

  there it is palmer hold it a mo-
ment now fire

  a terrific explosion that almost split
their eardrums as the noise was ampli-
field a thousand times in the closed han-
gar then a crash against metal a tear-
ing and crushing then through the ob-
servation window they saw the lights of
the sky-city below them and above them
the stars they were free

  the interior communiograph spoke
jules lacosse in the forward com-
partment sir nothing damaged ex-
cept a slight groove in the ships nose
reports from other sections of the
earthbound bore out the wisdom of
warrens hasty decision that the ship
would tear through the hangar doors
without any serious harm to itself war-
ren checked his course firing a light
blast from the starboard steering tube
and then set the automatic controls
straight for the icy planet earth

chapter iv

for many days the earthbound
hurtled through the black void at
a speed in excess of  miles
an hour even in that age it was a long
journey from saturn to earth requir-
ing five earth-months of time later
on it is true after laj cir the great
scientist of the planet tuxul in the sys-
tem of markab had harnessed the
ether ray the flight could be made in
a few days but the earthmen in the
crew were contented they were away
from their aggressors and warren and
earth rehabilitators consolidated	

nita were happy in the company of
each other and there was a definite
and worthy objective for all of them
an opportunity to remove the stigma at-
tached to outcasts and to establish a new
world for themselves

  two days journey distant from earth
warren was checking their course nita
was in the control room with him study-
ing the heavens through the televisor
suddenly she gave a startled little cry
and switched on the screen of the in-
strument

arren theres a space ship
following us

  bancroft dropped his charts and
hastened to the darkened vision booth
the large screen showed myriads of
stars and planets in a field of black
while directly in the centre was a for-
eign object that loomed larger and
larger even as he gazed

  turn on the magnifier nita its
a ship sure enough he declared as the
long silvery object filled the screen
almost entirely it has the red stripes
of the flag of the space police

  he made some hurried calculations
then turned to the transmitter of the in-
terior communiograph

  hello palmer we just picked up a
police ship in the televisor she is trav-
elling about  miles an hour and
is now  miles behind at that
rate she will reach us within two hours
can you start the emergency tubes
they are ready for service mr
bancroft but i am afraid that our
fuel supply will run low if we use
them

  cut them in that is a chance we
must take warren ordered

  ross griffin in answer to warrens
summons had rushed into the control
room and the three anxiously watched
the police ship on the screen of the
televisor

  the first half hour after the emerg-
ency rocket motors went into action
their pursuer dropped gradually behind
but when warren again took space
measurements he found to his conster-
nation that the police ship was gaining
on them

  they too must have turned on addi-
tional power hello palmer he spoke
into the transmitter of the engine room
circuit can we get more speed

  weve put on everything we have
mr bancroft the cooling system on
two of the tubes is closed and i am
very much afraid that they will burn
out the pyrometers show a tempera-
ture of  degrees fahrenheit now
   wait  and his voice died away
to be replaced by hasty unintelligible
orders that palmer was shouting in the
engine room there was a sound of
something sizzling and steaming then
palmer in an agitated voice spoke
again

tm sorry i had to rush off those
a confounded tubes went out just
now melted clean away no there
was no one hurt he reassured the
anxious navigator but i will have to
cut down the gas charges to save the
other tubes

  well do your best palmer but i
dont see how we can avoid being over-
hauled within a short time

  the three people in the control room
kept their eyes glued on the televisor
screen and with sinking hearts watched
the huge ship gain on them was this
to be the end of all their hopes and
ambitions bancroft thought fast in
the short space of time he had to de-
vise some ruse that would save them
they were inside of the belt of aster-
oids so they could not seek refuge upon
one of them the nearest body was
mars to reach it before they were over-
taken was an impossibility now that two


amazing stories

of the tubes were burned out and the
gas pressure had to be reduced in the
others as for offering resistance they
had no ammunition for any weapons
larger than their portable blast-guns

  warren was not concerned as much
with the thought that his plans would
be frustrated and that he would be sen-
tenced to death as he was with solicitude
over the fate of nita he reproached
himself for having permitted her to
come on a mission that was so hazard-
ous he felt that he had done a very
selfish thing indeed after all nita
had her father who would not have
seen her unhappy for all the world and
surely he could have devised some way
of keeping her from marrying gurra a
six year course at the great university
of betelgeux on the remote planet b-
cr for instance would have kept her
away from the ugly gurra well it
was too late now to retract what he had
done they must face what the future
had in store for them

the fast approaching ship was of
monstrous size warren recog-
nized it as the largest and speediest of
the vast space-police fleet it was
usually stationed on pluto but must
have arrived on saturn just in time
to serve gurras needs no other ship
could have overtaken them after the
start they had

  the space communiograph was buz-
zing a calling signal warren switched
it on a harsh voice protruded itself
from the loudspeaker into the control
room

  heave to warren bancroft you
can not possibly escape us we will re-
lease the magnetic grapple no foolish-
ness now the voice warned

  warren cut the transmitter in un-
der what conditions are you taking us
he asked

  your surrender must be uncondi-

tional you are charged by professor

v-si with kidnapping his daughter
nita and by gurra with attempted
murder and the theft of his space ship
the penalty for any of these offenses is
death in the chamber of purple vapor
if you surrender we will spare the lives
of your men

  warren looked at nita and then at
ross his eyes showed no fear they
were quizzical there was just a trace
of a grim smile playing around the cor-
ners of his determined mouth

  i am ready to put up a fight would
be futile gurra must have used up all
of the fire-ball chemicals on this ship
there isnt an ounce on board

  warren are you saying this to save
us nitas voice was accusing

  he is but hes not going to get away
with it ross cut in he was de-
termined nita and i talked this over
and we are sticking it out fighting it
out if you please you dont for a mo-
ment believe that lying gang of pluton-
ian cut-throats do you promise us
our lives will they

  he turned to the interior communi-
ograph palmer this is griffin stand
by to fire the steering blasts when the
police ship comes abreast of us then
to warren there is a slim possibility
that we can out-maneuver them at
least i am going to try it come what
will

  warren looked at ross gratefully
then placing one arm around nitas
slim waist he walked over to the man
and put his hand firmly on his shoulder
with staunch friends like these i feel
i could conquer the world he said sol-
emnly

  when the giant police ship came
alongside they saw the leering black face
of gurra through a porthole he was
talking to them over the communi-
ograph admonishing them to stop
threatening dire things if they dared
earth rehabilitators consolidated	

disobey when the earthbound
maintained its even pace without com-
plying with his wishes he resorted to
trying to bully nita his shrill voice
broke into the control room unpleas-
antly

  your father has asked me to bring
you back so you must obey him
he gave his consent to my marrying
you and commanded that you give up
your earth-slave he wheedled

  a tinge of annoyance spread over
nitas delicate features then she
flushed with indignation as she grasped
the transmitter

  gurra you ugly black monster you
lie my father never gave his consent
willingly you threatened and bullied
him into it as for getting me-just
try and do it

  the black face at the porthole became
horribly distorted with rage and
thwarted hope the lips parted to bare
the crooked fangs his reddish eyes
were rolling with rage he cursed
out a command to the ships officers and
then shrieked into the transmitter
you saturnian she-devil i have had
enough you and your earthling will
spin through space for eternity--not as
living creatures-but as charred flesh and
bones see if you can defy a fireball
oh the horrible monster he wouldnt
dare would he warren nita looked
up in alarm

tm afraid that he is capable of any-
thing although this sounds like a
bluff the police are in his pay and
they will follow his orders without ques-
tion see even now we are spinning
around helpless in the meshes of the
magnetic grapple projected from their
ship ill try ross idea a blast from
the steering rockets

  he shouted an order to the engine
room and a fiery flash from the side
of the earthbound was palmers re-

sponse although the ship jerked like
a startled fawn she snapped back as if
held by elastic bands and crashed vio-
lently against the hull of the police ves-
sel again they tried it and again the
same thing happened it was of no use
they were powerless in the grip of their
enemy

the two ships drifted about three
hundred yards ayart then through
the observation window the occupants of
the earthbound saw an incandescent
body a ball of fire leave a cannon-like
tube protruding from the side of the
police ship

  a fire-ball warren shouted i
did not think the devils would do it
come nita let me hold you in my
arms for the last time and as she rested
her head upon his shoulder and closed
her eyes to shut out the blinding inten-
sity of the slowly approaching fire proj-
ectile she whispered softly

  i do not mind warren i am happy
-more happy here with you knowing
that this is the end than i have ever
been before hold me tightly and let
us dream of our future our future
warren in another world

  a tomb-like silence pervaded the
earthbound the rocket motors had
been shut down the charging apparatus
was likewise dormant there was an
awed silence throughout the ship war-
ren and nita had drawn into the shadow
of the swithboard while ross grif-
fin stood upright like the good soldier
he was looking with unblinking eyes
straight into the dazzling fire-ball un-
moved unperturbed by the imminent
catastrophe a moment of respite for
these earthmen and the brave little sat-
umian girl before the hard metal plates
of the ship would become steaming
fluid before bodies that once moved
and loved and laughed would become
brittle and charred fragments of humanity


amazing stories

but suddenly the silence of the
void was punctured by sharp stac-
cato tappings on the plates of the ves-
sel like hailstones with occasionally a
heavier thump that caused the ship to
sway and pitch to a dangerous angle

  a shower of meteors  ross ex-
claimed that was a large one then
he became excited warren nita i
cant see the police ship any longer we
are moving we are falling away from
them

  the occupants of the control room on
the earthbound were thrown to the
floor violently as the ship lurched and
literally stood on its nose before being
borne down bow first at a tremendous-
ly increasing speed by a huge meteor
which had struck the vessel with a rev-
erberating crash by the time warren
nita and ross had regained their feet
the attacking ship was out of sight
and they were still plunging wildly
through space to the safety of distance
thanks to the impact of the meteor

  searching the ether through the tele-
visor warren discerned the faint out-
lines of the police ship many thousand
miles away the communiograph picked
up some feeble signals of distress that
indicated that gurras vessel had been
disabled by a meteor

  the feeling of tension and hopeless-
ness that had pervaded the occupants
of the earthbound gave way to relief
as they breathlessly discussed their mir-
aculous escape from what appeared to
be certain destruction palmer an-
nounced that the ship had not been
damaged by the meterors and he was
ready at any time to turn on the motive
power

  commanding palmer to start the
rocket motors warren headed the ship
in the disection of the earth which was
now a large white sphere in the sky
the next day they reached the outer
blanket of dense atmosphere

the surface of the earth had been
stripped of its atmosphere many
thousands of years ago due to the coun-
ter attraction exerted by a huge celes-
tial body this wandering body had ap-
proached within a few thousand miles
and drawn most of the air away from
the surface leaving but  thin layer of
it enveloping the globe when the
roaming star or planetoid passed from
sight the largest part of the earths at-
mosphere remained outside of the grav-
itational influence of the planet where it
continued to rotate as an invisible satel-
lite around the earth

  at once the earth became chilled the
waters of the sea turned to ice and the
land froze solidly it was like the
coming of another ice age only more
permanent in its effects and more dev-
astating

  fortunately for the inhabitants of the
planet a period of approximately three
months elapsed before it became impos-
sible for life to exist it was during
this time that feverish activities were
begun to leave the earth and seek refuge
upon some other planet space ships
were just being perfected although they
were still crude of design and unsafe
gordon bancroft one of the foremost
scientists and pioneer interplanetary ex-
plorers of the period was besieged with
pleas and requests for transportation in
the short time remaining he labored
night and day to construct as many
space ships as it was physically possible
for them

aiahe hardships suffered by the
earthmen during these icy days
were heartbreaking their food was
entirely consumed fuel could only be
obtained by blasting through steel-hard
sheets of ice

  millions had starved and millions
more were frozen to death and how
many succeeded in leaving the dying
earth rehabilitators consolidated	

planet no one knew gordon waited until
the very last to take off another day
and he too with his family would have
perished

  after being refused refuge on jupiter
he was allowed to land on saturn
where he and his small band were
promptly bonded into slavery in time
his descendants had been freed but the
stigma of inferiority was never re-
moved

  with the coming of the ice age great
changes were wrought upon the phy-
sical aspect of the earth all traces
of the former glory and civilization
were mowed down by tons of ice and
archeological expeditions from other
planets were unable to uncover anything
of significance but now owing to an
upheaval of the crust of the earth in a
region that was once known as northern
new jersey a portion of the ground
with its story of ancient life lay re-
vealed

ivf arren had no instruments that

  	 would tell him what portion of the
earth he was about to land on per-
haps painstaking maneuvering would en-
able him to find the desired latitude and
longitude but he dared not take a chance
of delaying he planned to leave the
ship with instructions for it to follow
as soon as he called when he reached
his destination he would send out a di-
rectional beam which would guide the
earthbound straight and true then
again warren was anxious to explore
as much of the surface of the earth as
possible for which purpose the overland
trip by sled would serve admirably

  the mechanics under the direction of
palmer had built a closed cabin sled
fitted with small rocket tubes this
vehicle could be propelled over the
surface of the ice at a speed estimated
in excess of a thousand miles an hour
the cabin was airtight and large enough

to accommodate four people comfort-
ably it was equipped with heating ele-
ments a communiograph set scientific
instruments and portable blast guns for
defense relying upon established data
concerning the density of the how rare
earth atmosphere palmer had equipped
the sled with a pair of folding wings
which would sustain them when hop-
ping from one elevation to another
this would be particularly useful in
traveling over the difficult mountain
passages

  by now the earthbound was en-
veloped in the blanket of hazy upper
atmosphere warren switched on the
communiograph to every part of the
ship

  stand by for landing he com-
manded

  the stern rockets had been cut off and
the bow counter-force tubes were
brought into action slowing the earth-
bound slowly so that she eased down to
a perfect landing on a smooth ice cov-
ered surface in fact the entire coun-
try as far as the occupants of the ship
could see was absolutely level every-
thing appeared grey and forlorn even
the sun was obscured so that it illum-
inated but did not warm the extinct
planet already the extreme cold had
begun to condense the moisture in the
atmosphere on the outside hull until the
portholes and the observation windows
were covered with a thick coating of
frost one of the mechanics appeared
and attached an electric heating element
to the window which melted the ice and
permitted a view of the outside world

  as all preparations had been com-
pleted for an overland trip in the sled
nothing remained but to take observa-
tions to ascertain their location and to
select the members of the expedition
by using a specially designed instrument
that combined the features of the sex-
tant and chronometer but required


amazing stories

neither sun stars nor greenwich time to
determine latitude and longitude war-
ren plotted his location on a chart

are plumb in the middle of

  	 what was once known as the
pacific ocean no wonder everything
is flat as far as we can see our des-
tination is  miles in a straight line
if we set our course north-east by east
allowing for the irregularities in our
route we will probably have to travel
over six thousand miles not counting
on any un for seen delays we should reach
new jersey in six hours warren was
explaining to nita and ross griffin

  now for the crew ross and pal-
mer and i will constitute the male mem-
bers of the expedition and in order not
to slight the ladies turning to nita
whose face was getting longer and long-
er at the prospect of being left behind
he bowed elaborately and added we
will take all of them along but mind
you nita i am not doing this will-
ingly he warned i would much
rather have you remain behind in the
security of the ship here they could
never find you but out there he indi-
cated with a sweep of his hand i am
not so sure about it but i realize how
keen you are about going along with
us so i wouldnt stop you for all the
world

  after giving some last minute orders
to wass dorn who was to remain in
command of the space ship warren and
his companions climbed aboard the sled
which the crew pushed through the
air-lock out upon the ice the men wtho
had to expose themselves to the rigor-
ous climate donned special garments
which kept them warm and they put on
helmets that supplied air the suits
that were to be worn by the four mem-
bers of the overland expedition when
they found it necessary to leave the
cabin of the sled were double walled

and warmed by a radioactive element
they were equipped with helmets and
an apparatus for manufacturing arti-
ficial air

  warren sat down at the wheel in the
tiny cabin and snapped on the rocket ig-
nition switch there was a red flash
and a reverberating roar as the sled
leaped forward like a frightened deer
the four adventurers waved a hasty
farewell to their companions and they
were off across the trackless waste for-
tunately warren and palmer had driven
rocket sleds on saturn and were there-
fore familiar with the peculiarities of
these strange vehicles sleds required
greater vigilance in handling than space
ships as the contour of the ground had
to be watched constantly although this
condition did not trouble them on the
smooth frozen surface of the pacific
ocean when they reached the land
conditions would be different and travel
more difficult

the tree descendants of earthmen
felt the tug of their home planet
deep dowm in their hearts while for
many generations their forefathers had
lived upon an alien world still a name-
less something kept telling them that at
last they had come back to their rightful
heritage not for a moment would any
of them admit it but they looked with
wistful eyes upon the bleak solitude and
hid from one another eyes that lost
brightness with mist

  three hours of fast traveling brought
them within sight of a high elevation
this was the coast of california with
the coast range mountains in the back-
ground warren worked a lever which
brought the wings of the sled into ser-
vice and just before they reached the
high coast he increased the speed and
adjusted the elevators so that the
vehicle lifted itself from the ice and
soared up over the first obstruction by
earth rehabilitators consolidated	

skillful maneuvering warren was able
to avoid irregularities that might other-
wise have been serious barriers to their
progress

the journey over the range of
mountains was however more dif-
ficult here they experienced their first
near-tragedy the sled was traveling
on its runners up the steep slope with
the front of the vehicle pointing up an
angle of forty-five degrees it was
necessary to proceed cautiously yet fast
enough to prevent stalling on the heavy
pull rounding an icy hummock where
the view ahead was obscured the sled
encountered a wall of ice warren cut
in all the rocket tubes in order to lift
the vehicle over the obstruction she
sailed up and cleared it perfectly but
came down heavily on the other side
there was a cracking and crunching of
ice as the sled broke through a layer
of frozen surface to their horror the
travelers saw that they were crashing
through and falling into a deep crevasse
the sled was slipping side way the run-
ners screeching shrilly as if in protest

  cbarge the right hand steering rock-
ets palmer dont move anyone
warren warned as their hearts thumped
wildly

  palmer worked feverishly turning
valves and starting the auxiliary com-
pressor it required but a few mo-
ments but to the white-faced occupants
of the careening sled it seemed like
ages

  there it is mister bancroft the
engine expert panted

  hold tight everyone here we go
and as warren threw the switch a flash
of fire came from the right hand tube
followed by an ear-splitting explosion
from the heavy charge

  the sled shot sideways as if thrown
by a giant hand luckily for the ad-
venturers the force of the rocket tube

was sufficient to hurl the sled up to the
plateau above where it landed on its
side precipitating its crew headlong
over one another

   fortunately no one was hurt and the
sled was undamaged except for a
broken window although the cabin
was equipped with a glass which had the
strength and flexibility of fine steel the
concussion was too violent for it to
withstand such a shock having fore-
seen such a contingency spare panes of
glass of the exact size were available
and the damage was consequently re-
paired in short order

  during the brief period when the
cabin was open to the outside world the
cold air had penetrated chilling every-
one until their limbs were stiff from the
exposure the air within had escaped
which rendered breathing difficult they
had not the time to don the special gar-
ments before it happened but now
upon the insistence of warren they
pulled the clumsy suits over their reg-
ular clothes

  its best to be prepared in case some-
thing like this happens again he ex-
plained

  since the beginning of the journey
over the frozen world nita had been
silent not wishing to obtrude herself
upon the busy navigator and his com-
panions she had much time for re-
flection and planned for the future
when warren would become established
as a reputable scientist in this new
world although she loved her home
planet saturn she looked forward hap-
pily to the day when the earth would be
habitable

the west coast of the united
states and the central part of col-
orado was difficult traveling it re-


amazing stories

quired two hours of skillful piloting on
the part of warren and must have been
extremely nerve-racking to the others
but they did not voice their feelings re-
calling instead their past experiences or
speculating optimistically about the
future

  ross griffin had been in constant
touch with the earthbound by means
of the communiograph wass dorn
who had been left in command of the
ship had nothing of interest to report
everything was just as they had left it
the long range televisor on the space
ship had not picked up any other craft
so there was no means of knowing
whether or not gurra had finally been
able to give chase

  the mississippi river was marked by
a winding canyon of ice that extended
north and south as far as they could
see soon after they reached the ohio
rivet and traveled along in its frozen
bed for a time until warren put on
skimming speed and the sled lifted up
over the mountains of west virginia
and pennsylvania warren and ross
checked their position constantly and
readjusted the course of the sled as re-
quired

  they had been under way for more
than seven hours now and would soon
reach their destination the faint out-
lines of the sun could be seen dropping
behind white-peaked mountains of ice
lighting up the western horizon with a
faint yellow glow soon it would be
pitch dark for twilight lasted but a few
minutes in the rarified atmosphere of
earth anxious to reach the site of dr
ru vas camp before dark warren or-
dered palmer to energize the spare
rocket tubes to increase their speed

nita was peering through the
the gloom but could see nothing
with the naked eye she reached for
the portable short range televisor and

directed it straight ahead on their course

  oh warren i see a light she
shouted excitedly look there just
ahead of us

  he took the instrument from her and
looked sure enough a tiny yellow
glow that became more pronounced as
they approached marked the site of
human habitation

  it must be dr ru vas camp hm
-thats queer i cant see it now
the light is gone

   with a puzzled expression on his face
he returned the instrument to nita who
searched the darkness ahead and finally
laid the televisor down

   i cant see it now either i am sure
that it was a light perhaps they turned
in for the night and put it out

  warren had slowed the sled down to
avoid running past the place and at low
speed he crept up the last incline to the
location that his instruments told him
must be the camp site of the expedition
he was positive that this was the very
spot that the light which he and nita
had seen came from but instead of
hearing voices of welcome in response
to their shrill signal horn nothing but
echoes came back to the expectant
group

ross switched on the high powered
rhomium illuminator and swung it
about in an arc the brilliant beam lit
up the blue-white ice and dazzled the
eyes of the watchers there were heaps
of red earth and rock where the expedi-
tion had been excavating and as the light
swept around it caught the flash of
metal ross griffin immediately focused
the beam upon this mirror-like surface

   zistite metal explorers huts war-
ren cried hold it there ross

  in the brilliant light they had no
difficulty in seeing clearly two huts
built of the new non-conducting metal
zistite stood revealed not more than a
earth rehabilitators consolidated	

hundred yards away this metal had
been adopted for building portable huts
and even houses in regions where ex-
tremely high or frigidly low tempera-
tures prevailed the metal was almost
an absolute non-conductor of heat and
was therefore admirably suited for this
purpose

  there was no sign of any one about
the place and as final proof that the
cabins were deserted they saw that the
doors of both of them were wide open
and swinging in the sub-arctic wind

  we will have to get out and search
around i dont exactly like the looks
of this warren said as he picked up
a blast gun just in case we need it
he remarked significantly

they had strapped ice creepers to
their shoes a necessary precaution
when walking on the glass-smooth sur-
face of this frozen planet having
been cramped in the close quarters of
the tiny cabin the four were stiff and
found it difficult to walk after stumbl-
ing several times they reached the first
hut warren had a premonition that
there was something inside that nita
should not be permitted to see

  you folks wait here until i come
out  call if i need you

  and with this he walked in flashing
his rhomium illuminator around inside
the sight that met his eyes was a hor-
rible one there thrown brutally into
bunks that lined the wall were the
headless blood smeared bodies of five
men the red blood was frozen as it
had dripped in rivulets from jagged
stumps of necks dumped uncere-
moniously in a heap in one corner were
the heads that once belonged to the
bodies warren saw the room reel-
ing around him he felt a queer sensa-
tion in the pit of his stomach then shut
his eyes and staggered outside

  nita was alarmed what is it war-

ren you are white do you feel ill
ill be all right its horrible in
there dont go in any one five men
brutally butchered i must take a peek
into the other hut wait here

  although still white and shaken war-
ren resolutely walked in through the
open door of the second cabin he re-
appeared in less than a minute by now
he had regained his self-possession but
was plainly puzzled

  nine of them in there he indi-
cated the second hut with his head
they too were murdered not a soul
alive anywhere i cant understand it
and there were some living beings here
not very long ago according to the light
we saw

  suppose you take nita back to the
sled palmer while ross and i try to
puzzle this thing out better try to
get a little sleep nita we may be late
in returning

  when the others had left warren
gave ross a detailed account of what
he had found in the huts try as they
would they could not for the life of
them come to any satisfactory solution
of the mysterious murder of a harmless
old scientist and his colleagues that
it must have been done by some type of
thinking creatures was self evident as a
close examination of one of the bodies
disclosed traces of seared flesh where the
head had been severed from the body

t was unquestionably done with a
flame-knife warren muttered as
he forced himself to perform the un-
pleasant task of examining the corpses
and flame-knives are the favorite weap-
ons of plutonians i wonder if it
could have been  

  he was interrupted by a shout from
outside it was nita running to-
wards the cabin he hurried to meet
her before she should enter the horrible
place


amazing stories

  oh warren she panted i just
heard the most awful thing over the
communiograph the central universe
police acting upon information re-
ceived from gurra have been ordered
to earth to arrest you for kidnapping
me and that is not the worst war-
ren you are charged with murdering
dr ru va and the members of his
expedition

for a full minute warren stood
there without answering then the
unbelievable accusation registered fully
in his mind he clenched his fists to
suppress his pent up emotions but an-
swered calmly enough as he recon-
structed the events as he thought they
had happened

  ross and i had just arrived at the
conclusion that the explorers had been
murdered by means of a plutonian
flame-knife now it is quite clear that
gurra must have arrived here in a space
ship of his own after abandoning the
police craft he then surprised dr ru
va and his men murdered them took
all of their findings and then brazenly
communiographed to the chief of the
universal police that i was the guilty
one

  now the question is where is gurra
and his gang of cut-throats and how
much time do we have before the police
swoop down upon us

  these questions were difficult to an-
swer but it was evident to warren
that he must establish proof of his in-
nocence he knew well enough that the
sworn testimony of nita and his other
two companions would not avail against
the corruption of the court of inter-
stellar justice after gurras powerful
influence was brought to bear upon the
judges

  however warren had no intention of
being caught defenseless he walked

back to the sled with nita and picked up
several black boxes containing delicate
scientific instruments he removed a
micro-camera and set it up close to one
of the bodies in the cabin and then fo-
cused the sensitive lens upon the severed
flesh in a few moments he had a per-
manent record of the microscopic struc-
ture of the seared tissue

  then he unpacked the recording-
analyzer which registered on a specially
prepared chart a chemical analysis of
the carbonized tissues with these two
instruments used in conjunction war-
ren hoped to establish beyond dispute
the fact that the weapon used was a
flame-knife a devilish device which only
a few high-born plutonians were per-
mitted to own

  warren and ross were weary by the
time they completed the work of record-
ing the evidence and they left the cabin
to return to the sled for a nights sleep
in the morning they intended to begin
excavating the frozen ground in search
of gordon bancrofts laboratory which
they estimated to be not more than two
miles from where they were outside
it was pitch dark the heavy outer
blanket of chilled atmosphere did not
permit the moonlight or starlight to
penetrate to the surface of the earth

for some unknown reason nita had
switched off the rhomium illumina-
tors this puzzled warren for a moment
then he accounted for it by assuming
that the glare was so strong that it
would not permit her to sleep she was
tired he thought and needed all the
rest she could get his portable il-
luminator flickered feebly and then
died down to a faint red glow the
steady use of it had exhausted the rhom-
ium charge and he had not brought a
spare tube along the only thing left
to do was to feel their way back to
the sled over the slippery ground mak-
earth rehabilitators consolidated	

mg sure to avoid a deep crevasse to
the right

suddenly they were blinded by
a light it came from the direc-
tion of their sled for just one mo-
ment warren and ross thought that
nita or palmer had turned on the most
powerful rhomiums but never be-
fore had they beheld anything so inten-
sive they were forced to shield their
eyes to shut out the terrific glare

  then something hot and searing
swept across warrens legs and he could
not suppress a cry of pain as he in-
stinctively clutched the calves of his
legs he saw with growing alarm that his
tight fitting explorers suit was on fire
he beat out the flames although his
palms were scorched and he leaped back
shouting a warning tn ross

  then they heard voices one was high
pitched and grating he could not mis-
take it it was the voice of gurra it
was his light they had seen in the dis-
tance when they had approached the site
and he and his men had evidently been
hiding in ambush until they thought it
safe to attack

  above the din warren heard nita
screaming his name the two men
were confused by the suddenness of the
thing but they rushed forward savagely
to be met by the hot searing flame
they dropped to the ground with a
strangled cry but the flame followed
them relentlessly and burned the hair
and skin on their scalps by now they
were half frantic with rage and pain
they ran desperately to escape the
blinding light and the hot flame but
it followed them pitilessly

  vague disjointed thoughts flashed in-
to warrens mind gurra would play
with them torture them in the sight of
nita and when he tired of his devilish
game he would merely focus the flame
to a knife edge and sever their heads

from their bodies and nita    
what would become of her

in their frenzy the two men raced
a madly in ever-widening circles far
to the right they collided violently their
bodies sprawled on the ground and the
force of the impetus rolled them over
and over again down a steep incline
although almost senseless wtith pain
warren realized that he was being pro-
pelled towards the edge of the crevasse
but he did nothing to stop himself it
would be far better to be dashed to
pieces at the bottom of a mile-deep cre-
vasse than to be roasted ignominiously
by the evil gurra he lost conscious-
ness just as ross rolling body struck
him and carried him over the edge

chapter vii

when he opened his eyes he
felt ross bathing a deep cut on
the top of his scalp-bathing it
with warm water as his eyes became
more accustomed to the dim yellow light
he realized several things-first that
ross and he were both miraculously
alive and second that the ground was
free of ice and warm and soft and
he was able to breathe although with
some difficulty without his helmet i

h what a head it feels as if
vy an atomic disintegrator was work-
ing in there let me up    

  and as he tried to rise ross gently
but firmly pushed him down then
for the first time he saw that his right
arm was heavily bandaged and secured
in a sling

  you just stay right where you are
i had trouble enough to stop the flow
of blood from that ugly gash in your
scalp without applying a tourniquet to
your neck now i dont want to go
through the agony of it again and


amazing stories

watch that right arm of yours it was
yanked from the shoulder socket but
i guess i set it properly those three
years in pre-medical school did me some
good after all he laughed

  what makes the ground so warm
here all the ice has been melted war-
ren puzzled after he had resigned him-
self to remain in a horizontal position

  hot springs ross explained ap-
parently caused by the percolations of
water through hot volcanic substances
you were saying some time ago that
during the period the earth was inhab-
ited this region was never suspected of
being volcanic but great changes must
have been wrought in the earths centro-
sphere since that time and we are now
deep below the surface of the earth
look up there

this was the very thing warren
had been doing lying flat on his
back he could not very well have avoided
it but now he concentrated his gaze
on the canyon of ice that reached above
him on both sides like the letter v
with him at the nadir or point or edge
while he could see that it was possible
to roil or slide down the sides of the
crevasse and through a miracle remain
alive not a host of miracles would en-
able them ever to climb out of there
without some aid

  its a mile high if its a foot and
me here with a dislocated arm he
groaned a little as he tried to move the
injured member

  it must have been late in the afternoon
judging by the deep shadows at the bot-
tom of the crevasse before ross would
permit warren to rise and walk around
ross himself had been painfully bruised
and cut but his wounds were super-
ficial and did not incapacitate him food

was a problem not a bite had either of

the men eaten since noon the day before
fortunately they found water but it had
a pungent odor and tasted disagreeably
of sulphurous acid it was evident
that they must try to find a way out
of the crevasse at once the longer they
waited the less likely would they be able
to withstand the hardships of a climb
if their search revealed a break in the
smoothness of the sides of their prison
walls

  it was a relatively simple matter to
decide in which direction to travel the
bottom of the gorge was not more than
ten feet wide the canyon stretched away
in one direction for about a half mile
then it made a bend beyond which the
two men could not see in the other
direction the canyon terminated not more
than two hundred yards from where they
were here the ice rose sheer like a huge
dam the soft spongy ground made it
difficult walking as the men would
sink ankle-deep into the swampy mud
they had to pick their way cautiously
around fumaroles which they found
in great abundance ashey progressed
after a short time they were compelled
to replace their helmets as breathing the
rarefied air became painful to their
overburdened lungs

as warren trudged along his
thoughts were on nita more than
likely she was now on board of
gurras ship bound for saturn if he
could only get out of this-but what
would he do then the cunning plu-
tonian had undoubtedly destroyed his
sled and the earthbound was six
thousand miles away with no means of
communicating with it wass dorn

    not to be confused with sulphuric acid the formula
of sulphurous acid is hasoa that of sulphuric acid

  the centrosphere is the interior of the earth from the  if condensable vapors issue from the ground in

lower or inner limit of the crust to the centre of the abundance so as to give the appearance of smoke the

would undoubtedly begin to search for
them after losing communiograph con-
tact with the sled but even if he did
manage to reach the plateau above how
in the world was he to know that war-
ren and ross were stranded a mile be-
low in the crevasse it appeared very
much as if a descendant of gordon
bancroft after thousands of years had
returned permanently to his ancestral
home-site

  the deep shadows became darker the
ribbon of grey sky above was no longer
clearly defined how far they had trav-
eled over the marshy ground was diffi-
cult to estimate with any accuracy as
they were forced to stop innumerable
times when warrens head made him
reel dizzily until he had to he down
to ease the pain the character of the
walls had not changed in fact if any
thing they were more sheer offering
not the slightest hand- or foothold even
if they possessed mountain climbing
equipment it would have been impos-
sible to scale those precipitous walls

  exhausted hungry and suffering from
the pain of their wounds the two lay
down on the soft ground and slept fit-
fully through the night in the morn-
ing somewhat refreshed by a bath in
a warm spring but with the pangs of
hunger gnawing at their stomachs they
took up the journey again

  ross was walking ahead peering off
into the distance while warren was
scrutinizing the walls trying like a
pygmy to find a defect in the armor of
a giant suddenly ross stopped and
pointed excitedly ahead

tttarren warren look over

  	 there he cried in a hushed voice
see those white things moving no
they are not blocks of ice they must
be living creatures-either that or its
my eyes

  no there is something moving be-

yond doubt i see it too warren
cleared away ross doubts and they
are coming towards us

  this was indeed true the obscure
white shapes were becoming more clear-
ly defined now as they assumed the un-
mistakable outlines of living creatures
they had white fur and the two men
were amazed to see that they were walk-
ing upright on two hind legs there
was no thought of retreat on the part
of warren and ross something seemed
to tell them that there was nothing to
fear

  as the creatures came closer they ap-
peared for all the world like lean-bodied
polar bears walking on their hind legs
their bodies and legs were shaggy with
white fur their torsos were slim ex-
cept for the immense swelling chests
but here the resemblance to animals
ended warren and ross looked
sharply at the creatures heads and
faces and drew back in astonishment
those faces covered as they were by
closely matted white hair were unde-
niably human

dear-men ejaculated warren

      descendants of those inhabitants
of earth who could not flee to other
worlds ross it is unbelievable am i
right or has my mind been affected by
that laceration on my head

  they are human and what is more
they wish to speak to us their voices
sound quite natural just listen ross
said fascinated by the sight

  a hundred yards away the band of
ten bear-men were gesticulating and
talking excitedly among themselves oc-
casionally pointing towards the two
strange creatures by listening carefully
warren and ross were able to distin-
guish some sounds that had a familiar

the strange white creatures reached
them

  one of them stepped forth and ad-
vanced hullo he shouted in a deep
voice

warren waved his hand and re-
sponded in english with a how
are you

  at first the bear-men in spite of
their ruggedness and gigantic size as
compared with their slim descendants
from common ancestors were shy and
non-committal they looked at the two
strange creatures timidly then more
boldened they felt their garments and
shoes warren and ross had lost most
of their instruments including the rho-
mium illuminators and blast guns so had
but little to show of the scientific and
mechanical marvels of an advanced civ-
ilization as it was the two were
more concerned with the all-important
consideration of getting some food into
their stomachs than in trying to impress
these primitive creatures with their su-
perior attainments

  warren asked for food and at the
same time indicated by gestures that he
wanted something to put into his
mouth and chew although they had
some difficulty in understanding him
they answered in a dialect which fol-
lowed the obsolete english language that
was spoken in this region during the
period when the earth was in her full
glory of civilization the descendants
of earth-men who had accompanied
warren on his perilous journey were
all able to speak the english language
to some extent

  it was a source of pride to them to
perpetuate the mother tongue from one
generation to the next in spite of the
persecution they had suffered because of
it on the foreign planets while many
words had been lost or modified beyond
recognition and the dialect was some-

what altered yet it would have been
perfectly possible for an american of
the twentieth century to carry on an in-
telligible conversation with a descend-
ant of an earthman living on saturn
so it was in the case of warren and
ross and the bear-men they soon un-
derstood one another

  the leader of the bear-men he who
called himself by the earth-name of
drew harv questioned warren and
ross and the two men briefly related
their story the white-haired creatures
listened with child-like expressions to
this tale of strange lands and mar-
velous machines they were astonished
to hear what had happened up on the
plateau whither because of the extreme
cold and rare atmosphere the bear-
men had never been able to ascend
they drew aside and whispered among
themselves then harv looked suspi-
ciously at warren

  you say that you are descendants of
men of this world true you are
white and your form is not unlike ours 
except that you conceal your bodies in
strange rustling stuff he pointed to
their garments are any people in the
land where you come from black in
color with ugly faces short of arm
and have they long sharp talons for
fingers he asked abruptly

  the two men were startled

  can he mean that he has actually
seen plutonians ross whispered

warren shook his head in a puz
zled manner

  such people as you describe are
from the distant outer planets of this
solar system called pluto where have
you seen such men it was warrens
turn now to ask questions it was
barely possible that these people might
have seen gurra and his men up on the
plateau

  but drew harv did not choose to
earth rehabilitators consolidated	

offer any further explanations instead
he motioned to his men who gripped
warren and ross by the arm and di-
rected them straight ahead they
trudged along in silence both men occu-
pied in puzzling out this new state of
affairs while their captors walked stol-
idly behind warren and ross could
hardly credit their senses-to think that
after these thousands of years during
which time the earth was supposed to
have been uninhabited they had now
dropped right in among the remnants of
a past great race of people the thing
was incredible yet it was true

  although they felt no concern about
their immediate fate among the bear-
men the sudden suspicion displayed by
drew harv did not augur well for their
future did he by any chance link them
with the race of plutonians against
whom he seemed to have an instinctive
hatred the description he had given
of this black race was too accurate to
be regarded as a chance query

chapter viii

before long they reached a break
in the sheer wall of the canyon
it was a dark hole hollowed out
like the opening to an underground
cavern warren and ross were pushed
through this narrow entrance between
two pillars of jagged rocks and were
led along a pitch black corridor where
the stench of decaying organisms came
unpleasantly to their nostrils in the
darkness the two collided against the
sides of the tunnel many times and
each time warren hit his bandaged
arm against some jutting stone he could
not suppress a low groan

  after stumbling through the passage
for perhaps a hundred feet the smell
of decaying vegetation was replaced by
the even more offensive pungent and
suffocating odor of burning sulphur

here the gloom was broken by a
smoky greenish flame directly ahead of
them following the light they entered
a chamber hollowed out of hard rock
some fifty feet in diameter with ceilings
lost in the dim haze of smoke above
at the far side in what appeared to be
a huge open fireplace they discovered
the source of the greenish illumination
a fire fed by subterranean chemicals
was burning with a low flame and a
great deal of smoke it served how-
ever to take the dampness out of the
air of the cave

  rough stone benches and tables con-
stituted the only furniture while for
decorations the walls were lined with
iron tipped spears and swords of crude
forgings it was evident that these
people had preserved the use of metals
although their products were pitiful con-
sidering the high state of scientific prog-
ress reached by their forefathers
thousands of years ago it was a case
of gradual decadence of a past civiliza-
tion rather than the primitive foreshad-
owing of a new one warren thought
sadly

drew harv and his men were

courteous enough as they invited
warren- and ross to sit down at a
table copper platters heaped high with
food were laid before the famished men
and they voraciously devoured every bit
without questioning it until their enor-
mous appetites had been satisfied one
dish was an excellent broiled vegetable
that they identified as a strange variety
of mushroom while the other in con-
trast consisted of fish which was almost
tasteless their hosts answered their
puzzled query regarding the source of
the foods the fish were chopped out
of the solid ice at the bottom of what
had once been lakes and rivers wrhere
they had been preserved in cold storage
since the waters of the earth had frozen


amazing stories

solid the mushrooms were cultivated
in the caverns the bear-men had
achieved some wonderful results with
this fungus through cross-breeding and
some varieties grew to the enormous
height of six feet it was their staple
diet as bread was at one time among
their ancestors and contained all the
essential vitamins

  feeling much refreshed warren con-
tinued his conversation with drew harv
telling him of his hopes of finding the
site of gordon bancrofts laboratory
the bear-man was interested he plied
warren with numerous intelligent ques-
tions finally revealing the fact that the
name and deeds of warrens illustrious
ancestor dimmed by time had been
handed down through the generations
as a legend he was considered an heroic
figure ranking with such names as ed-
ison marconi and einstein

  finally warren brought the conver-
sation around to the subject nearest to
his heart

  if you will give us aid in excavating
in the region of gordons laboratory i
am sure that we will find something that
will be of great value to your people
in reconstructing the civilization of the
earth and warren noting the crafty
look on the bear-mans face added sig-
nificantly and of increasing your own
power

  it might be arranged drew harv
admitted with feigned uncertainty but
first i must discuss it with the three
ancients who are the rulers of the
dwellers of the caves you will be
taken to your quarters where you are
to stay until i send for you and in
the event they harbored any thoughts
of flight he suffixed his statement by a
direct warning against any rash attempts
in that direction

  i have a hunch that old goat face
will do his best to help us in our
search ross whispered when they had

been taken to a tiny hole-in-the-wall
cavern where they huddled around the
warmth of slowly oozing subterranean
vapor

  it seems that the desire of man for
power has not lessened even though his
civilization crumbled back almost to the
stone age warren philosophized ross

i cant help thinking about nita i
try my best to hold myself together
but this inaction is just wearing my
nerves to a frazzle if we dont get
out of here and up to the top of this
hellish hole soon ill go out of my
mind he said despairingly

  ross tried his best to comfort him
but neither man could lift the burden
of uncertainty from his heart it
seemed extremely unlikely that they
would ever see their loved ones again
even though they were brought back
to saturn it would be as fugitives and
criminals given a short cursory trial
and then sent to the horrible chamber
of purple vapor better they thought
to die here on earth than to return to t
ignominy and torture

sleep brought a healing influence
to their distraught minds for when
they awoke it was with rekindled hope
that they contemplated the future their
bodies had been refreshed by food and
rest and they were ready to take a new
grip on their problems so it was with
considerable impatience that they await-
ed some word from drew harv regard-
ing the decision of the three ancients
under whose patriarchate the bear-men
lived

  but it was a long wait all that day
no one came near them except an old
serving woman who silently brought
food and water and as silently with-
drew answering no questions not even
indicating that she heard them

  i dont trust that man harv war-
ren muttered impatiently stamping up
earth rehabilitators consolidated



and down in the narrow confines of his
cell-like cave

  another day passed without a word
as did another night they kept track
of time by means of warrens universal
chronograph that had fortunately re-
mained unbroken then quite cere-
moniously a  tall shaggy bear-man
came into their cave and silently beck-
oned them to follow they were led
back to the large chamber where they
found drew harv waiting for them

  there are good tidings for you
sirs he was unusually polite the
three ancients in their wisdom have
approved your venture you are to
have all the aid you need we are at
your service

immediately upon receiving this
- promise of help warren and ross
began to make preparations for the
stupendous excavation work that would
undoubtedly have to be done to reach
the strata of earth beneath the ice cap
where they estimated the ruins would
be the problem of reaching the top
of the plateau with the necessary equip-
ment was relatively simple they found
out as a tunnel ran from the caverns to
the surface above but there was one
insurmountable obstacle in their way
the denser atmosphere in the deep cre-
vasse had sufficient oxygen to support
life while a mile above it would be im-
possible for the bear-men even with
their enormous lung capacity to live for
very long for this very reason the
dwellers of the caves had found it im-
possible to venture to the regions above
there were two possible solutions to
this problem one was to equip their
men with masks a plan abandoned al
most before it was conceived as they
lacked the material from which to con-
struct them and the other was to per-
form the work of excavating without
any outside help a seemingly impossible

task for a long time they were per-
plexed but suddenly ross griffin
slapped his startled friend on the back
so heartily that warren winced with
pain

  its the easiest thing in the world
you and i can do it alone how by
applying the cunning chemistry of the
bear-men they can help us after all

  that blue crystal that they saturate
with water to use as fuel for cooking
their food is a radio-active compound
of their own that has tremendous pos-
sibilities yesterday while you were
taking a nap they took me down below
to a deep underground cave where i
saw their chemists compounding it from
minerals they mine in this location they
demonstrated a concentrated mixture
that burned with such an intensive flame
that it melted a block of granite just
think with that chemical we can drill
a shaft right down through the solid ice
and soil and even rock until we reach
the required depth and the quantity
needed is so small that the two of us
can carry it without difficulty in one
trip

  warren recalled with what curiosity
they had first examined this compound
little dreaming that it was actually man-
ufactured by this race which was so
backward in other things but in the
worries that had beset him the idea
that this substance might be of value
in their work never came to him wast-
ing no time they made their wants
known to harv who immediately is-
sued orders to his chemists to prepare
a large quantity of the concentrated
crystals

chapter ix

while warren fretted impa-
tiently at the delay the skilled
chemists toiled unceasingly day
and night over giant retorts until they

had crystallized about one hundred
pounds of radonite as the substance
was called then with the precious
crystals carefully protected against mois-
ture in bags of fish skin warren and
ross were ready to leave the cave
through the passageway equipped with
copper shovels and picks bags of rado-
nite and the neutralizing agent urvion
they were heavily burdened and could
move but slowly

  warren led the way through the tun-
nel the dwellers of the caves deciding
that it was safer to remain behind as
they rested after passing up the first
sharp incline warren turned to ross
and held his fingers to his lips

  listen do you hear that it sounds
just like nitas voice

  low musical tones muffled by the
solid rock came to them as they placed
their ears against the wall

  i could swear that it was hers
ross whispered but that is impossible
it must have been one of the native
women you know how they can vary
the pitch of their voices

  they listened intently for another
minute but were rewarded by nothing
but silence after all warren reflected
bitterly nita would be back on saturn
by now and probably unhappily married
to the monster gurra thinking of
this did not put him into a very cheer-
ful frame of mind all his moodiness
returned and he answered ross in short
monosyllables

  the sharp upward grade eased to a
more gradual rise for which neither
of the toiling men were sorry in order
to gain the top of the plateau which
they estimated to be one mile above the
bottom of the crevasse it was necessary
to travel more than three times that dis-
tance in the darkness and over a rough
boulder-strewn floor the grey irregu-
lar patch ahead proclaiming the upper
end of the tunnel was a welcome sight

to the weary almost incapacitated men

  the region where they emerged into
the fitful daylight was unfamiliar to
them in all likelihood it was a con-
siderable distance from the scene of
their encounter with the plutonians as
neither the cabins nor the sled was any-
where in sight the two dropped their
heavy loads and after a brief breathing
spell started towards where they judged
the cabins to be fortunately they
guessed right the first time for after
about five miles covered at a fast rate
over the icy terrain they could make
out the flash of light on the zistite
metal huts

  their expectations were replaced by
disappointment when they found the sled
gone the hard ice showing faint tracks
that were lost a short distance away
the micro-camera and the recording an-
alyzer were exactly where they had
dropped them when they were attacked
they hid these instruments in one of
the cabins for future use

  the devils they have taken the sled
with them warren voiced his bitter
disappointment now we have no pos-
sible means of communicating with the
earthbound or of ever hoping to reach
her to make the six thousand miles
on foot would require almost a year
no the only thing we have to look for-
ward to is that wass dorn has already
decided to search for us even then he
must hurry for god knows at what
moment the police ship will swoop down
upon us

  we can at least get our bearings
from here warren its a lucky thing
that we took note of our position when
we stopped here in the sled now we
know the general direction and the dis-
tance

  yes the other man answered look-
ing of through the haze to where a
huge peak of ice rose above the ridge
of white mountains according to the
earth rehabilitators consolidated	

map the site of gordon bancrofts lab-
oratory is over there to the left of that
peak and it is exactly twelve and a
half miles from here by keeping track
of our steps we will be able to measure
the distance with sufficient accuracy un-
til we reach some of the other land-
marks that gordon mentioned in his
notes but i wouldnt place too much
reliance on finding any of them after
all these years

  they returned to the mouth of the
tunnel to pick up the radionite and
their tools after which they trudged
determinedly towards the slender spire
of ice the shadows deepened and the
grey light gave way to darkness where-
upon warren called a halt the two
ate a handful of cold mushroom cubes
rolled themselves in blankets made of
fish skin stuffed with asbestos wool and
slept without being rested on the hard
icy surface

  as soon as the light was sufficient for
them to discern their distant landmark
they started and before noon they
reached the site the flat ice-covered
landscape offered no clue to sink a
shaft at random would be nothing short
of a gamble for the ruins of the lab-
oratory buildings covered but a small
area and there were many miles of un-
marked country in which to locate this
almost microscopic thing

et me try to remember the de-
scription that gordon gave in his
diary warren sat down and thought
deeply he mentioned a small lake in
the rear of his main laboratory building
in fact he thought it was good sport in
his moments of relaxation to drop a line
from the window and fish for what he
called suckers

  how is that going to help us now
with every drop of water frozen as
solid as rock ross asked

  a lake would leave a depression in

the surface of the ice when the earth
froze over warren explained and if
there was no upheaval in the crust of
the soil as was the case back there
he pointed in the direction of the ex-
plorers huts then we should find the
lake without much trouble

  the ice was fairly level in this region
and any depression in its surface could
be detected readily the men separated
and walking in opposite directions be-
gan to search carefully

  warren warren here it is ross
shouted from the distance

 warren hurried to join him and
checked his findings there in the
otherwise smooth surface of the ice was
a hollow about two hundred feet long
that might at one time have been a
small lake

  yes this looks like it ross well
sink test shafts at both ends unless
we are lucky enough to strike it the
first shot and wasting no more time
on words warren began measuring out
a quantity of radonite that he esti-
mated was sufficient to melt through a
twenty-five-foot layer of ice and provide
a shaft six feet in diameter

  from that point they would be com-
pelled to sink the shaft in stages of five
feet at a time to avoid going too deep
he inscribed a circle in a likely looking
spot at one end of the lake and sprinkled
a small quantity of the neutralizing
chemical urvion around the circumfer-
ence to confine the action then cover-
ing the area of the circle lightly with
the radio-active crystals the men
stepped back hurriedly as the radonite
began to glow red then white hot con-

  	radonite as compounded by the bear-men contained
a certain amount of radium the other substances
served to speed up the disintegration of radium so that
its atoms were transformed into heat energy one gram
of radium evolves about one hundred and twenty glor-
ies of heat an hoar which is more than enough to raise
its own weight of water from the freezing point to the
boiling point radium also decomposes water a gram

same content of energy aa two tons of the best coal

verting the solid ice into water which
instantly turned into steam as the
action became more violent and the sub-
stance burned deeper into the ice a
huge geyser of live steam and hot water
shot up with a roar in a column six
feet in diameter to the height of five
hundred feet the two archeologists
gazed at this man-made phenomenon
with awe

 i hope that the action stops soon
warrens voice sounded dubious
otherwise it might continue right on
through the laboratory and disintegrate
the safe and the documents inside

  perhaps we should have sunk a test
well first ross mused remorsefully
then realizing how ridiculous his sug-
gestion sounded at this time he smiled
a bit wanly i only hope we are at
the wrong end of the lake then we can
be more careful the next time

  the concern felt by the men was not
unfounded they were experimenting
for the first time with a powerful chem-
ical action they had no way of ganging
or controlling true the bear-men
had given them the results of their ex-
periments but these were far from
reliable as they had never attempted
anything as stupendous as this

  that their fears were fully justified
soon became evident ross cautiously
crept near the column of live steam and
boiling water and threw a stone over
the brink of the shaft down down
it went for what seemed to be an ap-
palling depth while he counted the sec-
onds on the chronograph until it struck
bottom a hurried estimate revealed that
the well was already more than a hun-
dred an fifty feet deep and still the
action of the radonite continued ap-
parently unabated

  by this time the geyser had become a
volcano it was erupting stones rock
fragments and hot sand with mighty

explosions that could be heard for miles
this thing was getting beyond control
and was becoming extremely dangerous

  something went wrong with our ex-
periment warren shouted above the
noise of the explosions and the hissing
of steam well have to stop it-
right now ill try pouring urvion
on it

  and shaking off the restraining hand
of his friend he fought his way through
the hot gases and steam and sand to the
very brink of the volcano if it were
not for his fireproof garments and hel-
met he would have been overcome by
the fumes and burned alive but even
as it was the terrific heat had penetrated
this barrier and his body and head felt
like so much boiled meat he hastily
emptied the contents of a bag of urvion
into the raging inferno and summon-
ing his last ounce of strength leaped
back and clear of the crater just as a
terrific explosion rocked the very foun-
dations of the universe a large piece
of rock struck the back of his head and
just before he lapsed into unconscious-
ness he saw a fissure of ice opening
like huge jaws as if to swallow this
puny mortal who had dared to disturb
the slumber of nature after these thou-
sands of years

o	oss griffin stood for a mo-

   ment spellbound by the suddenness
of this cataclysm then he sprang for-
word and seizing the inert form of his
friend he dragged him over the slushy
lava-pitted ice just in time to save him
from plunging into that gaping hell-
hole from the safety of distance he
watched fascinated by the awe-inspir-
ing sight for a length of at least three
hundred feet the sheet of ice had been
burst asunder and the unceasing action
of the radonite converted the thousands
of tons of ice and rock into hissing
steam and molten lava which was spewed
earth rehabilitators consolidated	

from the fissure and thrown high into
the air

  for perhaps fifteen minutes this min-
inature volcano continued its eruption
then without warning it ceased the
violent steaming died down to a few
wisps of white vapor the hot lava
cooled rapidly then everything became
so still that the contrast was appalling
warren recovered from the effects of
the blow and the heat exhaustion in
time to see the tail-end of the strange
phenomenon

  ross im afraid to go over and look
im afraid that everything beneath that
blanket of ice is destroyed i should
have had more sense knowing that this
was a new experiment

  warren despite his courage and de-
termination had since the disappearance
of nita become a creature of moods

  old man ross looked at his friend
tenderly youll have to pull yourself
out of that here we are on the brink
of success and pointing into the
chasm he added with a smile i mean

literally as well as figuratively and you
take such a down-hearted view of things
why man that eruption was the best
thing that could have happened it ex-
posed the surface of the ground under
the ice and all we have to do is jump
down there open the door of the safe
and remove the papers

  the other mans enthusiasm had some
effect upon warren for he shook off
his lethargy and strode over to the fis-
sure looking down into the abyss he
beheld the results of the mighty force
of radonite for a distance of three
hundred feet a strip of ice fifty feet
wide had disappeared entirely and to
his joy he saw blocks of stone and bricks
made unmistakably by the hand of man
and which proved conclusively that they
were gazing at the ruins of a building
erected by early earthmen contrary
to their expectations the action of the
radonite had not removed more than
a few feet of topsoil and rock just
enough in fact to make it unnecessary
to do very much excavating

mr sheridan is a new author as far as our readers are concerned we are
sure that his work will meet with high approval a strange attack at least
strange in its methods is adopted by the orientals who are on the verge of
conquering america their work depends on a giant power station and
we are told of how the heroes of the story cope with the apparently all-

powerful enemy

by max c sheridan

the little group had tired of
playing bridge and unani-
mously decided to spite the
sweltering heat of a torrid
july day by a dip in the
white tile pool they separated and
went their respective ways to dress for
the swim

 joan and arthur brooks eva and
phil doran had all completed their
work at harvard the preceding june
and were gathered at the brooks an-
cestral home for several companionable
weeks joan and arthur were brother
and sister as were eva and phil the
four had formed quite a noted group
in campus activities joan and phil
eva and arthur had paired off as nat-
urally and suitably as jack and jill
and the brothers and sisters had formed
such a compatible clique that it had
become a campus byword

  phil doran had been active in the
athletic affairs of harvard tall lithe
and bronzed he was the more quiet
and reticent of the four on the other
hand arthur brooks was shorter a
trifle inclined to stoutness and had a
descriptive phrase or pun for every in-
cident the two gtrls were both lively
and vivacious-ready for any adventure
or suggestion joan was a brunette
eva a blonde the four were certainly
individual types but their contrasting

differences seemed only to strengthen
the ties which bound them in harmoni-
ous friendship

  the group reassembled on the spotless
tile of the inclosed pool and drew lots
to determine the first victim whose duty
it was to dive in and test the tem-
perature of the clear depths arthur
won or rather lost and with sour
grimaces ascended the ten-foot tower
and teetered precariously on the end of
the board

  well go ahead adonis lets see
you execute a cut-away one and a half
taunted joan

  hell execute it all right laughed
eva hell murder it in cold blood

  pretending fury at the disparaging
remarks arthur made his approach in
the accepted style struck the end of
the board and rose to arch into a really
beautiful swan dive

  there was an audible oof as he
hit the water the velvety surface
yielded under his weight then re-
bounded as if activated by springs
and threw the astonished arthur high
in the air to land sprawling and breath-
less on the bank of the pool

  gasps of consternation and dismay
broke from the lips of the three on-
lookers before they could recover suf-
ficiently to assist the would-be diver lo
his feet


it seemed to consist of an enormous searchlight with its reflector about
ten feet in diameter and which was mounted on a vertical shaft one foot

amazing stories

  what on earth happened arthur
are you hurt what did you do
gasped eva all in a breath

  he jumps like a rainbow trout was
an irrelevant comment from the taciturn
phil

  shut up phil its no joking mat-
ter his sister scolded

  by this time arthur had recovered
his breath sufficiently to haltingly de-
scribe his sensations i dont know
just what happened-i dove and when
i hit the water it seemed just like land-
ing in an acrobats net-then the blame
stuff threw me up in the air-and thats
all i know about it

  the three gazed at each other ques-
tioningly at arthurs inconceivable de-
scription until eva galvanized them into
activity by the sensible suggestion that
they see for themselves the group
advanced cautiously to the bank from
which they had so precipitously re-
treated and phil leaned over the edge
presumably to dip his hand in the
clear water his fingers touched the
surface and he drew back in amazement

the confounded stuffs just like

  a rubber he ejaculated

  the others had by this time made
the test for themselves and found the
surface of the water yielded but would
not allow immersion of the hand when
pressure was applied it gave then re-
bounded just as phil said like india
rubber

  what do you suppose has hap-
pened asked joan

  god only knows do you suppose
some of our friends have somehow or
other played a trick on us asked eva

  how on earth could they do that
what could they possibly do to the
water to make it act like that scoffed
joan

  oh i dont know but if you can
offer a better explanation lets hear it

retorted eva perhaps herself dissatisfied

 arthur interposed come come
children to settle your puerile bicker
ing professor soandwhozit will proceed
to make a thorough scientific investiga-
tion of this remarkable phenomenon
with these words he confidently stepped
out on the surface of the water

  the others gasped as they watched
the smiling arthur stepping springily
on the surface of the liquid he stopped
about the middle of tfie pool and called
to the three on the bank come on
in the waters fine talk about your
rubber ice this takes the cake

  phil immediately joined him and
after a little coaxing the two girls fol-
lowed the four of them walking
calmly about on the surface of the liquid
certainly made as strange a sight as has
ever been seen after a few minutes
the group paused to consider the
strange surface on which they were
standing

 there came a moment of silence
broken by a terrified shriek then the
four splashing and choking made their 
way to the banks of the pool and
climbed out dripping wet their
strange floor had suddenly dissolved be-
neath them giving them an unexpected
dip in the cool water

 while the unfortunate four were
changing clothes and recovering from
their unusual experience the whole world
was busy discussing the phenomenon of
the hard water

  ships in mid-ocean had suddenly been
lifted high and dry on the surface of
the salty deep propellers churning the
air frantically while amazed officers and
frightened passengers wondered what
kind of deep sea monster had risen
under them bathers seeking escape
from the july sun had suddenly found
themselves floundering ludicrously on a
firm surface housewives had found
the household bean resting majestically
interfered ce



on the congealed surface of its liquid
bath and water faucets mysteriously
dry inoffensive citizens quenching
their thirst had found themselves swal-
lowing a lumpy mass for the duration
of the phenomenon the entire globe
was in a quandary everyone at a loss to
explain the sudden rebellious trans-
formation of the most familiar matter
then as suddenly as it had appeared
the mysterious symptom vanished leav-
ing the plentiful dihydrogen oxide as
wet and familiar as adam had found
it subsequent notes on the phenomenon
revealed the fact that it had been univer-
sal and that it lasted exactly two hours
of course this information was of no
use whatsoever but the investigators
had in some way to justify their ex-
istence

in  ten years before this re-
markable aquatic phenomenon came
the epoch of the brief but disastrous
second world war by the treaty of
san francisco japan and her allies in-
dia china and russia had been de-
prived of their navies according to
the treaty these countries were to have
only a very limited number of merchant
marine to carry on their necessary com
merce not a single destroyer not a
super-dreadnought not a single sub-
marine or aircraft carrier had they been
allowed to keep america by reason
of her enormous losses had appro-
priated every japanese and allied ship
and had incorporated them in her own
powerful navy now the united
states abetted by her acquisitions cer-
tainly had the most powerful means of
oceanic offense and defense in the
world she boasted that never again
need she fear attack from any or all of
the world

  of course japan and her allies had
protested vehemently at these drastic
terms but their defeat had been so com-

  plete they were obliged to accede to the
conditions japan however made quite
a fuss about giving up her magnificent
navy and pleaded that they might be
converted into merchant marine amer-
ica fearing treachery refused her pleas
and further incurred the resentment of
the orientals by commanding curtail-
ment of airplane production and the re-
duction of the existing fleet japan
after entering a formal protest against
the severity of the terms said nothing
more and apparently once again peace
reigned supreme over the entire globe

  recently there had been reports from
various secret agents in the east that
trouble was brewing among the oriental
nations but nothing indicative of open
hostility had occurred this news was
soon forgotten in the excitement of the
strange phenomenon of the hard
water

  soon even this unheard-of incident
became an inconsequent thing of the
past and once more the humdrum ex-
istence of daily life was the chief con-
cern of hurrying bustling mortals the
four friends of course shared in the
popular excitement and the gradual re-
turn to normal they dallied with the
theories advanced by prominent sci-
entists to account for the phenomenon
and discussed their own peculiar ex-
periences soon however they returned
to their games of bridge and their golf
their dances and social doings with
only an occasional word of the strange
swimming party

  meanwhile cupid was busily engaged
in his amorous duties and apparently
was making a great success proof of
his diligence was announced one day in
the society columns of the evening
tribune the public was informed
that miss joan brooks would soon be-
come mrs philip doran and miss eva
doran would take the name of mrs
arthur brooks at a double wedding


amazing stories

the two couples would then leave on
their honeymoon aboard the brooks
yacht the corella for a three months
voyage in southern waters they in-
tended to touch various points of inter-
est including the famous galapagos
islands

  on august thirtieth the reverend
gentleman of st johns church per-
formed his disastrous duties and amid
considerable rice and several pairs of
nugatory brogans the two young
couples hastened to board the corella 

there was a tremendous confusion
and hustling and bustling as the
two hundred and fifty foot yacht backed
out from her berth into the open waters
and turned to her course gongs
sounded engines hummed then re-
lapsed into ominous silence finally the
corella recovered from her temporary
relapses and after the last tug had left
her started under her own power for
more southern parts the newly mar-
ried four stood arm in arm at the rail
enjoying their last glimpse of the u s
for several months to come and waving
goodbyes to the friends who had come
to see them off

  that evening they danced on the
hurricane desk and as is the eternal
habit of honeymooners commented on
the brilliancy of the stars and the
gorgeousness of the moon while appar-
ently looking at nothing but each other

  by the time the corella had braved
the maze of panamas intricate locks
and had emerged triumphantly into the
great pacific the newly-weds were be-
ginning to notice their surroundings
when they caught their first sight of
the famous galapagos they were in-
tensely interested they had already hur-
riedly collected all the data available on
these islands of nature they found
that the inca chief tupac yupanqui
braved the deep blue waters long be-

  fore columbus had his first bath and
named the galapagos ninachumbi
or mountain of fire then they
pondered the volcanic isles must have
been in action at least within historic
times they learned that rogers was
supposed to have buried rich plunder
somewhere in their depths they read
the supposition that the incas might
have found their last stand here safe
from the attacks of pizarro they read
of the few voyages and the scanty ex-
ploration of the islands especially the
most famed of all-the island indefat-
igable whose huge center crater had
never been trod by the foot of man
they read with interest explorers ac-
counts of the strange fearlessness of the
types of animal life which have inhab-
ited the isles in safety and peace from
time immemorial-how the animals
feared neither beast nor human and
would interestedly examine the hand
that fed them-truly the fearlessness of
the garden of eden

  they were interrupted by the cap-
tains message land and hurried to
get their first glimpse of the enchanted
isles there just where the blue of
the sky merged with the deeper shade of
bottomless waters they saw the broad
flat disc of purple haze rising slowly to
a sharply conical elevation near its cen-
ter-natures own retreat-the isle in-
defatigable

  they watched the tiny purple vision
grow till it became a broad slowly ris-
ing vista of low shrubs and cacti
topped by the precipitous rugged peak
which formed indefatigables huge cen-
ter crater finally the co-rella an-
chored in a little sheltered bay and the
four eagerly put off in the motor-boat
for their first look at the the flora and
the fearless animal life of which they
had heard so much as the boat
touched the sandy shore arthur brooks
leaped from the bow with the taunt

  laha first man in no-mans-land
man before monkey you know he fin-
ished helping his bride ashore

 monkey before man you mean
corrected eva

  aha a heathen are you dont be-
lieve in the bible eh what would
your sunday school teacher say
this southern air must have affected
his head commented phil helping
joan ashore

these absurdities disposed of the
four turned their attention to the
land on which they found themselves
they had gone ashore in a little cove
at either side of which were jagged lava
reefs inclosing a softly sloping beach
of white sand dotting the pure white
of the sand were countless vari-colored
shells of all kinds forms and dimen-
sions cones chitons conches and many
others some hundred feet up the slope
the pure white of the beach gave way
to dark and dingy protrusions of sharp
lava from a charred and burned
foundation while in the distance ris-
ing against the blurred background of
the center crater were myriads of huge
cacti and clumps of low bushes alto-
gether indefatigable was by no means
a garden of eden one could easily
understand why no commercial ship
ever ventured to linger near its bleak
inhospitable shore and why none but
buccaneers shipwrecks and irrespon-
sible scientists had ever ventured to
brave its razor-like lava and its al-
most insurmountable piles of shifting
sliding clinkers

  arthur interrupted their inspection
hey look theres a mermaid down the
way they followed his gaze and
saw a full-grown sea lion and her cub
awkwardly waddling out on the beach
with the tameness of all galapagos
animals in mind they started toward the
two with the intention of examining

them intimately however at the first
sight of the four humans the mother
grunted a warning and command to her
offspring and the two slipped into the
water and were gone

  come back we wont hurt you
called arthur after the vanished an-
imals well now thats a funny
thing darwin and beebe and all of
them said that the animals would let
you come right up to them that they
were as curious about humans as hu-
mans are about them i think phil
must have scared them to death with
that svengali map of his

  more probably they tired of listen-
ing to your inane chatter retorted phil

  the four gazed for a moment at the
azure depths which had swallowed the
sea lion and her cub then turned again
to the seared and blasted landscape
they picked their way silently through
the maze of cacti and barb-lanced
bushes which threatened them on every
hand the drear scene was not one con-
ducive to conversation

  say folks said arthur this re-
minds me of a story about-

  about the traveling salesman i sup-
pose interrupted phil

  at a scorching glance from his better
half phil subsided and arthur con-
tinued-

  about a traveling salesman who was
distributing farming equipment in cen-
tral new mexico he had traveled for
miles without anything more interesting
than a vast expanse of sage brush and
mesquite broken only by occasional
clumps of-more sage brush and mes-
quite finally he came to a dilapidated
ranch-house which seemed on the verge
of ultimate dissolution with a crooked
weatherbeaten sign informing him that
this was pleasant ranch although
he was a trifle inclined to doubt the ab-
solute veracity of the board it was
well after dinner time and he decided


amazing stories

to inquire into the possibility of getting
something to eat he was met at the
door by a withered bent old cow-
puncher apparently in not much bet-
ter shape than the ranch-house at his
inquiry the cow puncher escorted the
salesman into the dining room where
he was introduced to a second very
seedy-looking individual who it seemed
was the owner of the ranch during the
very frugal meal the salesman asked
the owner how he could make a go of
ranching in such a barren spot

  waal said the rancher you see
that cow puncher there

  the salesman admitted that he did

  waal continued the rancher hes
worked fer me fer two years now and
i caint pay him in two more years he
gits the ranch then ill work fer him
till i git it back

 vrthurs story brought a laugh
xl frgm the two girls but phil ap-
peared to be listening intently to some-
thing the others had not heard he held
up a hand motioning them to silence
they stood motionless for several sec-
onds but heard no sound

  i might have been mistaken said
phil relaxing from his tension but
i was sure i heard a rifle-shot from
somewhere ahead

  probably what you heard was the
mainspring breaking in your upper
works scoffed arthur

  im almost sure i heard a shot
murmured phil

  do you suppose anyone else could
be on the island

  i dont know there was no ship
anchored when we came and its im-
possible for one to have arrived in time
for its occupants to reach the interior
before us i must have been mistaken

  evidently concluded arthur

  the group had paused in their ex-
ploratory ramblings and now simul-

taneously turned to view the gorgeous
scene which had almost miraculously

evolved in the west the sun which
had been so recently a well-defined
ball of blazing heat secure in its heav-
enly abode now was poised irresolutely
above the mystic depths of the unruffled
waters-its flaming glory shaded and
tinted to a soft rose by its veiling whisps
of clouds the soft hues of the placid
sky seemed to deepen gradually to a
clinging purple haze of indescribably
sinister hue which enfolded and clothed
with an air of evil majesty the huge
cone of the crater indefatigable

  if any artist could thrust off the
bonds of human fallibility and bring the
varied hues with the accompanying air
of vague and sombre elan to rest upon
the flat surface of his canvas the whole
world would rise up and claim him to
be an exaggerating effulgent fraud
beautiful yes but impossible and
therefore improper and useless such
are the rambling digressions of our nu-
gatory race

  the group stood spell-bound for
many minutes before they realized tjiat
the scene before them meant impending
night and the necessity that they return
to the shelter of the yacht no one
dared to break the silence which meant
so much to each in his interpretation of
it all and without a word they turned
and with many a backward glance made
their way slowly to the edge of the lap-
ping waters where the dinghy waited

  aboard the yacht the resiliency of
youth asserted itself and the deeper
feelings of the evening were displaced
by a merry good humor which was ac-
centuated by the music of the piano in
the salon and the revealing brilliance
of electric lights

  after a dinner which only an amer-
ican negro can cook enjoyed with appe-
tites which only crisp salt air and plenty
of exercise can create the group gave
interference



over the evening to the restful enjoy-
ment of dancing under the brilliance of
stars in a tropical sky

   the after-deck where the select affair
was under way boasted only of low
steel rails to separate them from the
unfathomable black waters of the equa-
torial night soft shaded lights threw
shadows on the calm waters below
which distorted and maligned them in
their relations to the swaying figures
above the lights seemed not to dis-
pel the darkness but merely to mold it
into something more familiar to the
ken of man leaving a still unexplored
remoteness in the shadowy dusk of the
deck

t tnder the influence of the wiles
 of the dark the temporary frolic
was diverted to a more thoughtful mien
and soon the two couples retired to
the inviting benches along the guard
rail conversation languished in def-
erence to the mood of the group until
arthur broke the silence in almost an
apologetic tone

  say folks do you see what i see

  see what was the laconic query
from phil who seemed almost to resent
the interruption

   that light up there above the crater
see it seems as though it were a re-
flection of a fire deep down in the
crater you dont suppose indefatig-
able has come to life again do you

  dont see how its certain that
the crater has been dead for a thou-
sand years at least its hardly possible
that nature would set the scene and give
an eruption for our particular benefit-
but-by jove there is a light up there
arthurs right look girls

  the vague outline of the huge crater
was dimly visible in the distance its
sectioned top in relief against a glow
which reflected from the clouds above it
back to the rim the distant illumina-

tion certainly came from within the cra-
ter but its steady unflickering mien
rather discouraged the possibility of an
eruption- rather it seemed a steady
burning perhaps of some natural-gas
jet recently come to life in the bowels
of the dead crater

  the group watched the faint glow
with interested speculations as to its
cause until far into the night it was
with regret that they finally forsook the
dusk of the deck for the necessary rest
of the physically tired

  all night the eerie gleam from the
distant crater cast its vague light on the
encompassing rim when the gray
dawn finally began its progressive re-
vealment of the cacti-covered shores and
the endless reach of lapping waters the
light went out with the suddenness of a
snuffed candle

  bright and early  the morning phil
arthur and the two girls were on deck
to see if their strange light were still
in evidence after convincing them-
selves that it was gone and almost de-
ciding that they had imagined their vi-
sion of the night before they hurriedly
gulped down their breakfast and once
more put off in the motor-boat for a
continuation of their exploration

  this time they took lunches with
them and started out immediately for
the interior of the island the captain
had tried to dissuade them from the
trip telling them that it was almost an
impossibility to penetrate very far in-
land because of the extremely rough go-
ing however the four were determ-
ined to attempt the journey to the base
of indefatigables crater in an effort to
learn more about the strange illumina-
tion of the evening before

the four were in high good humor
and picked their way among the
jagged lava boulders and barbed thorn
bushes with a continual exchange of


amazing stories

pleasantries arthur as usual was wise-
cracking and poking sarcastic jabs at
phil

  why dont you pick those canal
boats up when you walk he asked as
phil stumbled over some of the shift-
ing sliding clinkers theres where
two feet make a yard

  you havent much to say about beau-
tiful proportions retorted phil with
those ears of yours you look like a lov-
ing cup from behind if i were you
i would be very careful not to wiggle
them-you might fly away

  this apt remark put an end to arth-
urs friendly sarcasm for the time being
and the group slowly continued on to-
ward the interior there was very lit-
tle of interest in the monotonous scene
of cacti lava boulders and thorn bushes
no one had much to say of course the
rugged tiresome climb may have had
something to do with that by this
time they had progressed some four
miles inland and were beginning to feel
the pangs of noonday hunger by
mutual agreement they stopped and
spread out their lunch on the rough
cinders sitting around the improvised
meal on odds and ends of volcanic
debris the four were seated looking
down the long climb they had made at
the bottom of which lay the tiny yacht
in its miniature bay

  finally after much squirming mov-
ing and adjusting of the makeshift
chairs the party busied themselves with
the disposition of chicken sandwiches
dill pickles cake and sundry

  there came the sound of stealthy foot-
steps behind them phil turned in
time to see the leering yellow face and
the slant eyes of an oriental before he
was grasped roughly and a towel smell-
ing of ether held tightly over his face
other short stocky yellow men treated
the others in a like manner before any-
one had a chance to so much as move a

muscle the struggles of the four died
out under the influence of the anasthetic
and the orientals six in number soon
had the arms of the four manacled be-
hind their backs producing automatics
they sat down laughing and conversing
among themselves in sing-song gutturals
while they waited for the awakening of
the four friends

  how are we to dispose of these tsi-
lo  asked one of the group

  mercadon said not to harm them
and to bring them to headquarters an-
swered tsi-lo

  why do we go to all that trouble
why do we not dispose of them so
easily asked another raising his au-
tomatic suggestively

  mercadons orders returned tsi-
lo and mercadon is to be obeyed
while his highness is gone

  mercadon is a soft-hearted fool
complained the other

  best not let him hear it he might
attempt to change your opinion

  by this time the effects of the mild
anasthetic began to wear off and the
four friends started to rouse from their
stupor soon phil sat up and looked
around

ttthats up what in the devil

  	 is the idea he demanded of
the orientals

  tsi-lo answered for them all no
sabby he said

  it was not long before arthur sat
up as he saw the six short yellow men
surrounding him well look here he
murmured if it isnt the yellow peril
himself

  no sabby returned tsi-lo

  who said you did asked arthur
what i want to know is-what in the
devil do you mean tying us up like
this

  no sabby returned the inscrutable
tsi-lo
interference



  do you suppose he does or not
asked arthur turning to phil

  i dont know but asking them wont
get us anywhere how are the girls
as if to answer his question the two
girls sat up almost at the same time and
looked confusedly around them after
a moment they realized the situation and
eva asked what in the world do you
suppose they want with us

  dont know said phil perhaps
theyre asiatic bandits and are going
to hold us for ransom

  whatever their reason the orientals
didnt see fit to enlighten their captives
after the four friends had completely
recovered from their involuntary nap
they were motioned to their feet and
were silently led by their captors to-
ward a deep gully a few hundred feet
away it wtas rough going and without
the aid of their hands the four friends
took some pretty bad falls tsi-lo
noticing their difficulties searched the
two men for weapons and then untied
the hands of the americans motioning
them ahead of him with his automatic
in hand

  when they reached the little ravine
the four friends gasped in astonishment
there in the bottom stood a late model
automobile while up and down the
gulch as far as they could see was a
graded surfaced road here in the
middle of one of the wildest most rug-
ged lands in the world-an automobile
and a road what was the meaning of
it all phil tried to ask the silent cap-
tors but the only answer he could get
was no sabby

  the four were motioned into the
tonneau of the big car and four of the
orientals stood on the running boards
with tsi-lo at the wheel and one of the
others beside him in the front seat the
motor purred at a touch of the starter
and the car started smoothly forward
home james murmured the irre-

pressible arthur it looked as if it
might be quite some time before they
were even to start in the direction of
home and arthurs sally brought no
answering smiles from the other three

  as they wound in and out along the
ravine always climbing the four won-
dered at the possibility of a road and
automobiles existing on galapagos why
had the road been built how had it
been kept secret

  phil had a sudden inspiration say
folks this is the reason those sea lions
were afraid of us these chinks have
probably been hunting them for food
and thats why i heard that shot last
night

  that may be so replied eva but
the question is-why are they here
why has this road been built why
the high-powered car on a supposedly
uninhabitable island 

  phil shrugged his shoulders dispair-
ingly i have not the faintest idea
but it looks as if at any rate we are to
find out something more soon

by this time the car had slowly
climbed to the foot of the abruptly
rising mountain which housed the crater
indefatigable it was evident that no
road could have been built along its
precipitous sides without it being vis-
ible plainly at a distance and no such
mar defaced the cinder-covered lava of
the steep slope where then did the
road end if it didnt wind its way
over the mountain where did it go

  the solution was soon disclosed
nearing the base of the hill tsi-lo
turned left along the smooth crest of
an interrupted lava flow and followed
along the base of the mountain for some
hundred yards the road now turned
abruptly to the right and led to the
dark yawning mouth of a tunnel
switching on the headlights tsi-lo
drove swiftly into the black opening


amazing stories

  the car roared its challenge to the
steep climb and the walls of the cave
echoed and reechoed until it seemed the
mountain must split apart from the
commotion in its innards almost
deafened the four friends made no at-
tempt at conversation and spent their
time examining the passage through
which they were speeding illumined as
it was by the brilliant lights of the car
they could plainly see that it was man-
made its walls and top were rough
and jagged and once they caught a
glimpse of dynamite boxes piled in a
short cross cut

   some distance ahead a point of light
became visible growing quickly as they
sped along soon they emerged through
the opening and were almost blinded
by the sudden glare of the sun after
their eyes had become accustomed to the
light they eagerly examined their sur-
roundings

  they found they had penetrated to
the interior of the crater and as the
automobile now came to rest they saw
that they were on a circular balcony of
solid lava some two hundred feet wide
which extended entirely around the cir-
cumference of the crater in the mid-
dle of the crater yawned a huge hole
around which the balcony seemed mirac-
ulously suspended several hundred
buildings of various sizes were scattered
along the huge ledge men were com-
ing and going busily while from the
depths of the huge center pit came the
sounds of many voices and the clanging
and bustle of intense activity huge
flood-lights illumined the pit for the
benefit of the workmen and made vis-
ible the intricate machinery it con-
tained sounding even above the
clamor and noise of the workmen there
was a deep roaring which seemed to
come from the depths of the pit below
them at one side arose a pipe from
which a mighty volume of steam rose

into the air above them to condense and
fall like mist

  their observations were cut short as
tsi-lo motioned them from the car he
led the way to one of the larger build-
ings and stood aside to let them enter
they found themselves in a remarkably
well-appointed office-soft upholstered
chairs a lounge sideboard and a roll-
top desk beside the desk a well dressed
oriental presumably japanese was
busy with a pile of papers he looked
up at their entrance arose and made
a sweeping bow and said in perfect
english

uj adies and gentlemen i am hon-
ored please be seated and
make yourselves comfortable while i
attend to a little matter of business
turning to tsi-lo he spoke rapidly in
his native tongue do they know why
you have brought them here were
there any others with them

  no mercadon we told them noth-
ing we captured them without a
struggle evidently all the crew of
their ship stayed on board for the four
americans were alone

  it is well you can leave the rest
of it to me you may go now tsi-
lo made his departure and mercadon
turned back to the four friends

i hope you have in no way been in-
convenienced by your little journey
phil answered for the group i dont
know who you are or how you happen
to be here but why were we made
captives and forcibly brought here
my dear sir the suave oriental
answered it is merely a matter of
ethics you see japan is today declar-
ing war on your country and so of
course we were forced to detain you
japan declaring war on the united
states echoed arthur why they
havent a chance in the world they
havent a single battleship dreadnaught
interference



or submarine and very few aircraft
and little merchant marine how do
they expect to get anywhere

  but ships are not everything in-
terrupted mercadon but let us not
talk about it just now that can come
later have you dined lately

  the four declared they had just
eaten and that if they hadnt they
would not care to eat under the present
circumstances anyway

  oh but you must not feel that way
about it declared the jap here you
see we are all very friendly your stay
here i hope will be brief and pleasant
you will be held only until japans
success is assured

  not very sure of yourselves are
you sneered arthur

  but we have good reason to be-
well you shall see now would you
like to look over our establishment here
i assure you it will be very interesting
and quite educational

  notwithstanding the fact that the
friends were displeased and antagonized
at the turn affairs had taken they
were all eager to learn just what this
whole elaborate scheme was about and
nodded their willingness

  mercadon smiled and escorted them
from the building out across the circular
balcony to the edge of the pit there
a broad stairway led down to the depths
below they followed him down some
hundred feet to the superficial bottom of
the pit on which rested the maze of
machinery they had glimpsed from
above this however was not yet the
bottom he led the way down another
stair into a huge underground chamber
from which seemed to issue the tre-
mendous roaring they had heard above

  the odor of ozone was strong in the
air and the roar almost deafened them
looming up in the vague light of the
room were numbers of huge masses of
machinery from which issued the deep

hum shouting to make himself heard
above the din mercadon explained
our workmen using a churn drill
penetrated three thousand feet into the
bowrels of the volcano and tapped an
enormous steam-pressure area installed
in this chamber are ten of the largest
dynamos in the world these gener-
ators are run by huge steam turbines and
generate over fifteen million horsepower
apiece or a total of over one hundred
and fifty million

turning mercadon led the way
back up the stairs to the bottom of
the initial pit the pit was probably
five hundred feet across and occupying
its very center was the intricate mass the
friends had seen from the balcony it
seemed to consist of an enormous
searchlight with its reflector about
ten feet in diameter and which was
mounted on a vertical shaft one foot
through sturdy framework held the
shaft rigidly in numerous bearings and
the base of the shaft was apparently
geared to a motor on the floor of the
pit a two foot swivel conduit led
from the generator room below the pit
up to the huge light above the whole
set-up gave the impression that the
light was constructed to revolve at a
high speed

  in a circle around the searchlight at
a distance of about one hundred feet
was what appeared at first sight to be
an enormous picket fence closer ob-
servation showed that the stakes were
in reality round shafts of some silvery
white translucent substance the shafts
were about two inches in diameter and
extended from the bottom of the pit to
the rim of the balcony-a distance of
one hundred feet they were placed a
fraction of an inch apart-about the
thickness of a case knife blade the
complete circle was connected both at
the top and at the base of the pillars

with heavy insulated cable and the en-
tire fence was mounted on heavy in-
sulation

  you see here said mercadon a-
he was interrupted by the clanging
of a gong turning hurriedly he
beckoned the four to follow him and
made his way up the stairs to the bal-
cony above the workmen had ev-
idently completed their jobs and had
cleared from the pit men were as-
sembling from all directions to the
front of a building which was set well
toward the edge of the balcony

  the friends followed the jap as he
hurried toward the assembled group on
a staging at the edge of the pit was a
switch board with numerous dials and
several ebony handled switches mer-
cadon stopped before the board and
asked the time has come

  yes your honor it is now one min-
ute till four oclock

  mercadon turned to watch the sec-
ond hand of a clock incorporated in
the board as the hand moved around
the dial he laid his hand on the handle
of one of the switches as it reached
the figure  he engaged the switch

there came the low whir of a start-
motor and the huge searchlight be-
gan to revolve slowly on its vertical axis
as it gained speed mercadon intently
watched its dials a moment passed
then he threw in a second switch and
disengaged the first the low whine of
the motor grew to a screech as the light
revolved faster and faster till it almost
seemed a stationary globe in the center
of the pit finally when the motor
reached its maximum and the scream
had passed up beyond the range of hu-
man ears mercadon again glanced at a
dial-then threw a third switch

  the four friends stared in amaze-
ment at the throw of the switch
evidently the current of the huge dy-

namos below had been thrown into the
huge searchlight the light was revolv-
ing at far too great a speed for any
beam to be visible but the entire pit
was illuminated with an eerie violet
glow the circle of strange metallic
rods surrounding the reflector gave off
iridescent many-hued lights changing
and scintillating with a weird cold
beauty forming around the circular
fence was a solid wall of coruscating
stratified radiance which shimmered and
flickered like the clear cold glow of the
aurora borealis it was a magnificent
scene yet it gave the impression of
tremendous inexorably ruthless power
about which there was nothing calm or
soothing rather it pitched every fiber
of the body to the breaking point every
nerve groaned in protest against impreg-
nation with the racking vibrating waves
of unfathomable power

  mercadon turned again to the switch
board made a few notations on a pad
smiled in satisfaction and nodded to
the friends

  come now let us find comfortable
chairs where i can explain all this to
you in detail-that is if you care to
hear about it

  of course the friends did so mer-
cadon led the way back to his office
when they were all comfortable in their
places the jap began

  perhaps it is best to begin at the
beginning during the war of 
japan had one of her scientists work-
ing on the possibility of developing a
death ray that is one which would
incapacitate the enemy at a distance i
was that scientist my work continued
even after japans terrible defeat and
the treaty by which your country so in-
considerately deprived japan of her
ships and aircraft at length i dis-
covered something not the death
ray understand but something which
puzzled the best of japans physicists
interference



  i had been working with tremendous
voltages which i was attempting to
modify and change in such a way that
a concentrated beam would be inimical
to life one day while working in my
laboratory i happened to direct my con-
centrated beam on a small piece of ore
which i had been analyzing the water
was running from a faucet over a
sink in the corner and i happened to
notice that the instant i directed the
beam on the ore the water ceased run-
ning from the tap interested i put a
bowl of water in the center of the room
turned the beam on the ore clamped the
projector in place and examined the
water i found that it had apparently
congealed the surface of the liquid
would support a heavy weight

  the four americans gasped as they
remembered their experience in the
swimming pool and the incredible phe-
nomenon which had astounded the whole
world

  yes i see you remember your ex-
perience of a few months ago chuckled
mercadon but that comes later
when i saw what my beam would do
my interest was aroused and i carefully
reanalyzed the piece of ore i found it
contained nickel silver iron traces of
iridium and of gadolinium i then con-
tinued with my work by building up a
synthetic alloy of these five elements
which i called hyolite i found that
when the high frequency beam acted
upon this alloy the same conditions
were produced--that is the water in the
near vicinity exhibited the same peculiar
phenomenon after synthesizing and
perfecting the alloy i turned my efforts
toward determining how the action of
the beam on the alloy produced those
phenomena i wont bore you with
the tiresome details of my research-but
eventually i came to the conclusion that
the high frequency current of my con-
centrated beam striking on the alloy

was in some way changed and diversified
to produce an energy with which we are
little familiar this energy supposedly
produces in an enormously high degree
that attraction which we call surface
tension surface tension as you know
is that attraction between the molecules
of a liquid which seems to hold them
more firmly together at the surface than
in the interior this tension causes the
contraction of a falling liquid into round
globules it makes possible the suspen-
sion of a steel needle on the surface of
a calm body of water it causes mercury
to assume the shape of the tiny spher-
oids when spread on a flat surface it
enables the tiny insect skipper to glide
serenely over the surface of his pond
without wetting his feet we see it in
the soap bubble the dispersion of the
high frequency beam by hyolite in-
creases the attraction between the mole-
cules at the surface of the water-hence
increasing the surface tension and pro-
duces a tensile strength on the surface
which will support many pounds per
square inch this enormous increase of
surface tension is of course what
caused the drying up of the faucet by
changing the water in effect to a semi-
solid

r taving completed my prelim-

    	inary research i announced my
discovery to the japanese government
none of them at first realized the im-
portance of my research for that mat-
ter neither did i at the moment it
was some time afterward that i hap-
pened to think that the ocean in fact
every ocean in the world could be con-
gealed if a large enough central power
station were possible then if the en-
tire pacific ocean were affected- it
was then that the stupendous possibil-
ities of the thing struck me why-the
oriental armies could simply march
across the sea and overwhelm america


amazing stories

  i again conferred with the govern-
ment heads and put the whole thing be-
fore them the possibility of it was
doubted and many were the heated de-
bates which took place in the secret
council- it was only after repeated
demonstrations in my laboratory and
confirmations of my findings by every
prominent scientist in japan that they
finally consented to the scheme i was
given the assignment of planning a huge
central plant for the production of the
tension energy with all the resources
of the government at my command

  the american and european coun-
tries were carefully watching every sus-
picious move in japan and it was
deemed inadvisable to carry on the work
at home so by a secret agreement
japan bought the galapagos islands
from ecuador i left immediately for
the inlands with two thousand trained
men and the best of every type of elec-
trical and scientific equipment

  meanwhile the japanese government
was not idle deprived of all ships and
aircraft they at once set to work to de-
velop the fastest means of land trans-
portation in the world- they developed
armed tanks capable of almost three
hundred miles per hour they de-
signed and built huge numbers of trans-
port automobiles which were capable of
the same speed they perfected big
guns on traction carriages capable of
nearly two hundred miles per hour
this time japan was going to do the
thing right she brought about alliances
with russia india and china and ex-
acted promises of a certain number of
fighting men at a specified time by
this means she has collected an army of
almost two hundred million men-more
than the entire population of the united
states

  for ten years now japan has been
preparing for the venture for ten
years i have been here on indefatigable

with my helpers working and planning
for the ultimate consummation of my
dreams i have accomplished them
the machinery i showed you a little
while ago is capable of increasing the
surface tension of every sea ocean and
lake in the world to a point where it will
support the weight of a steam locomo-
tive

  of course the enormous power is
furnished by the steam-driven turbines
these in turn activate the super-dy-
namos which you saw in the room
below the pit the current from all
these is collected stepped up through
transformers and supplied to the uranio-
selenium cell in the huge searchlight in
the center of the pit when the power
is turned on the cell and the reflector
rotate rapidly the high frequency beam
falls in turn upon each of the hyolite
columns which comprise the circular
fence these diversify the beam and
bring about the increased surface ten-
sion in every body of water in the world

   at first i was afraid the tensile en-
ergy would increase the surface tension
of the liquid in the body for instance
the blood to a point where it would no
longer circulate-hence the person would
die i experimented along this line and
found- that it had no appreciable affect
whatever on the body fluids the en-
ergy of living matter seems able to suc-
cessfully nullify the enormous tensile
energy i have never satisfactorily been
able to explain just how it does this
however it is sufficient that it happens
to do so

  just two hours ago now as you
know i threw the switch which started
the generation of this energy and for
almost two hours now two hundred
million fighting men and thousands of
efficient engines of destruction have been
racing toward the west coast of the
united states at over two hundred miles
per hour at that rate it will take
interference



tlem a little over thirty hours to reach
america of course all americas fine
elaborate battleships her submarines
her destroyers will be absolutely useless
they will be all be stranded high and
dry on the hardened surface of the
water of course they can use their
airplanes but all the airplanes in the
world could not stop the asiatic army
from reaching america besides
america will be taken completely by
surprise she has not the slightest ink-
ling of any action against her the
japanese and allied armies will avoid
all the heavy coastal fortifications mak-
ing their way inland and coming upon
the defenses from the rear thus the
defeat of the united states will probably
be accomplished in a few days

  as for the phenomenon of the hard
water which so amazed the world a
few months ago-that was merely a pre-
liminary test of the efficiency of our
plant here

u  vhen you mean that japan is now
a on her way to conquer the u s
gasped phil

  ftjet us not say conquer let us rather
say japan is merely asserting her
rights to more land for her crowded
population corrected mercadon

  you mean to say phil that those
damned chinks will be over-running our
country in a little over twenty-four
hours 

  that is what our good friend here
has attempted to convey to us

  well good lord cant we do some-
thing about it

  i dont know what it would be we
seem to be pretty well cornered
that is exactly it my friends do
not attempt anything rash for it will
get you nowhere and will only force us
to put you in bonds for a day or so
advised mercadon

  eva and joan said nothing-there

really being nothing to say under the
circumstances an idea was beginning
to form in the back of phils mind but
he gave no hint of it what if he
could reach that switch near the pit for
just one moment what if he could
shut off the mighty power beam for a
single instant would not the released
tension allow the two hundred million
soldiers and their vast equipment to
sink into the depths of the broad pacific
what if the power were turned back
on-then it would be too late if he
could only make a break for it-no mat-
ter what happened to him afterward
mercadon seemed almost to realize
phils thoughts as he calmly continued
of course to prevent any accidents
the power switch was automatically
locked the instant it was thrown-thus
nothing less than a major breakdown
can frustrate our plans for the last
two months the workmen have been
busily engaged in endeavoring to make
our set up here absolutely perfect acci-
dent brain- and fool-proof

  phils heart sank had mercadon
read his thoughts but no of course
the jap had thought of the same pos-
sibility phil had been pondering and
had carefully prepared for it could he
do nothing at all to prevent the yellow
hordes from reaching and overruning
america it didnt seem so

  mercadon continued here is one of
our latest developments he turned
and led the way to a circular basin of
what was presumably water though its
surface was now of course in a solid
state over the water with the lower
end resting on the surface was sus-
pended a heavy steel shaft the shaft
was enclosed in a tubular housing at its
upper end and a large dialed indicator
was attached to the housing a jap
was constantly watching the needle on
the dial this is what i call the ten-
sion indicator it shows any infin-

itesmal variation in the tension of the
water

p hil listened to the japs words

	while his own mind was busy with
potential possibilities if he could only
get word to one of americas huge
aircraft carriers at panama of course
the ship would be stranded because of
the congealed water but a plane could
fly over indefatigables crater and drop
a bomb on the diabolical mechanism
but how in the world could he get word
to the aircraft carrier say-the japs
must have a powerful broadcasting sta-
tion here-could he possibly get to it
and send his message no that was
out of the question of course it would
be carefully guarded against any pos-
sibility of that wasnt there any way
he could warn them of course if he
could only get out of the crater and
back to the cor ell a it would be an
easy matter for the ships operator to
get in touch with the aircraft-carriers
but phil knew every move he made
would be watched and any attempt at a
get-away would end in defeat

  but wait-the radio station-inter-
ference-the tension indicator-confu-
sion- phils mind raced no it was
impossible a scientist of mercadons
ability would never have overlooked a
detail like that and then again it
might not work at all anyway at best
it was merely a chance and a mighty
slim one at that-still it was a chance

  he spoke casually i suppose you
have a broadcasting unit here mer-
cadon

  but certainly replied the jap we
have i believe the most powerful sta-
tion in the world-a million watts it
was easy to see that mercadon was
proud of his station

  could i take a look at it asked
phil you see i am interested in radio
-dabble with it at home a bit myself

  surely smiled mercadon i will be
glad to have you see it

  he turned and led the way to a struc-
ture a few hundred feet from his office
and motioned the four friends through
the door truly it was a huge broad-
casting unit banks of tubes were on
all sides and panel after panel writh
their myriads of dials and indicators
lined the walls a microphone stood on
the operators desk at one side phil
interestedly examined the intricate ap-
paratus and studied the dials and indi-
cators minutely

  certainly is a wonder he finally
said id like to see a transmitter like
this in action

  very well returned mercadon
this will be a good time to send the
news of your capture to the home office
in japan

  i might say he continued smiling
quizzically at phil that we are operat-
ing on an extremely low wavelengtii
here-a small fraction of a meter we
do this to avoid any possibility of our
messages being picked up by outsiders
and to prevent any possibility of their
locating this station with directional
loops so you see that even if you
might manage to overpower me and
send a message no one would receive it
but my friends in japan

  i had no thought of such a thing i
assure you returned phil as he
thought to himself extremely short
wavelength-good

tjmne now that that is settled we
shall proceed with these words
mercadon switched on the power and
proceeded to talk rapidly into the micro-
phone in his native tongue while phil
watched the proceedings interestedly
phil walked over to one of the panels
and pretended to watch the power indi-
cator intently while covertly watching
the door of the station
interference



  whatever phil expected it wasnt
long before something happened an in-
tensely worried jap came bounding
through the door and spoke excitedly in
japanese my god mercadon the ten-
sion indicator is going down fast
mercadon leaped up in alarm im-
possible he cried

  it is come and see quick
mercadon ran after the frightened
oriental without stopping to shut off
the transmitters power and with never
a glance at the americans of course
the friends had not understood a word
of the conversation but they knew from
the tones and actions of the two that
something momentous was happening
phil nodded in satisfaction

  come now quiet-nows our chance
he whispered to the others outside
everything was in a hubbub mercadon
barked out orders rapidly and men scur-
ried here and there to do his bidding
no one had any time to observe the four
as they crept cautiously around the cor-
ner of the building and made swiftly
arid silently for the yawning black
mouth of the tunnel

  they crept along for some distance
before phil produced a tiny flashlight
from his pocket and illumined the tun-
nel ahead of them i was afraid to
show a light till we got back a little way
explained phil now all of you run
just as fast as you can

  there was neither time nor breath for
more words as the four raced through
the dark passage it seemed many times
farther now than it had when they sped
swiftly through the tunnel in the high
powered car and when they finally
emerged into the fading light of early
evening all were panting for breath and
the two girls were staggering

   sorry - to - torture - you - girls - ike-this
but weve just got to make it to the cor-
eltaf panted phil

  they slowed down to a fast walk as

they wound their way along the tortuous
curves of the smooth road whenever
the girls recovered their breath suffici-
ently they ran for a while thus by
alternately walking and running they
traveled for some considerable distance
before phil stopped suddenly and held
up a warning hand i hear the auto-
mobile-theyre after us come on weve
got to get away from the road he
swerved to the side and the four scram-
bled up the bank of the ravine and out
on the cacti covered slope distinctly
now they could hear the sound of the
approaching car keep going he told
them they cant spot us the ravine
is too deep

 and keep going they did not
stopping to heed thorn bushes rocks or
cacti they heard the car whiz on down
the ravine toward the shore as they con-
tinued their mad flight it wasnt long
before they heard the machine roar
back up the road toward the crater

  going back after reinforcements
explained phil theyll bring a lot of
men down here and spread them out to
try to find us weve got to hurry now

r t ow they ever arrived at the beach

	they never knew but there they
were torn bruised and bleeding and
dog-tired there were the lights of the
corella winking at them out in the
harbor

  they ran across the smooth surface
of the congealed water in less time than
it takes to tell and thankfully climbed
aboard the corella to be met by an
astonished and somewhat worried cap-
tain

  what in the world has happened
he asked you all look as though you
have been fighting wildcats

  we have said phil briefly wheres
the radio operator quick with that he
rushed for the transmitting room and
the hurriedly summoned operator switch-

  o k said the operator whats
up

  tell you later phil flung over his
shoulder as he rushed from the room
he hurried back on deck and found the
captain talking with arthur any guns
on board get them out and arm the
crew i expect an attack from the shore
any time now

  he was right it wasnt five minutes
after the rifies and revolvers had been
distributed that they heard the sound of
an approaching automobile soon the
headlights appeared and the car came
to an abrupt stop dark figures piled
out and hurried to the water line

  shoot them if they start toward us
phil ordered its a matter of life and
death

  dark shapes swarmed across the water
toward the corella  and stopped only
when the crew started to fire the japs
were not unarmed either as the chatter
of a machine gun and the spat of bullets
on the yachts deck soon proved for
some time a real battle raged between
the crew and the men below on the sur-
face of the water however the out-
come was foregone the crew of the yacht
had shelter from the fire but the japs
had none soon the last of them lay
stretched on the still congealed surface

  now those on board the yacht heard
the distant drone of approaching planes
soon they were circling above the crater
moments later the deep muffled roar of
a distant explosion told of the destruc-

tion of the mechanism in the crater im-
mediately the corella lunged deeply
and rocked violently as the solid surface
of the sea gave way and returned her
to her rightful natural position the
bodies of the slain japs bobbed up and
down for a few moments with the action
of the newly released waves and slowly
floated away

  out on the broad pacific where a mo-
ment before an unending line of armed
uniformed men had been speeding in
armed tanks and huge transports at over
two hundred miles per hour for amer-
ica where thousands upon thousands of
almost impregnable armored cars and
millions of tons of huge guns had been
racing smoothly east-now there was
nothing-nothing but an endless reach
of rolling tossing water the sea had
opened and swallowed them up abso-
lutely nothing remained of the asiatic
allies ten years of work two hundred
million young men in the prime of their
lives ambitious energetic-irrevocably
gone truly it was a destruction of
cataclysmic proportions-but america
was saved

  the corella s motors hummed sud-
denly and she drew slowly away from
the bleak and most certainly inhospitable
shores of the island indefatigable

 n the salon phil was anxiously check-
ing up on the crew and after finding
all present and none injured he sank
back in a deep chair with a sigh of relief
there was to be no rest for him for some
time however everyone wras besieging
him with questions after the four had
told the story of their capture and their
experience in the crater arthur turned
to phil

  say old man just what did you have
up your sleeve there in the radio station
and just what caused our yellow friend
so much excitement that he even forgot
our existence
interference



  well began phil you see i had
been trying to figure out some way that
we might make a break for the tunnel
when mercadon showed us that tension
indicator i wondered at the time what
would happen if that indicator showed a
decreasing surface tension i knew that
he would probably forget all about us
in his effort to determine the trouble
you see just one second of released ten-
sion and they were lost

  well about that time i thought
about the radio transmitter youve
heard of interference havent you as
applied to the transverse waves of the
electromagnetic series  then you
know that when one wave meets or
overtakes another it may either double
or completely nullify the effect accord-
ing to whether the crests and troughs
of the two waves coincide or whether
the trough of one meets the crest of
the other in the first case the inten-
sity is doubled in the second it is
entirely destroyed for instance two
loud sounds if so pitched and directed
that the crest of one wave meets the
trough of the oncoming wave will be-
come a complete silence of course
sound waves are longitudinal but the
same instance is applicable to both long-
itudinal and transverse waves in the
same way two bright lights forming
interference with each other will pro-
duce total darkness

  it is exactly the same with the waves
of the radio broadcast interference

between the waves of two stations gives
the crooners voice the effect of a slow
exaggerated tremulo when two stations
are near each other on the wavelength
dial i was not at all sure that the
energy distributed by the tension gen-
erator was of the same type further-
more i didnt know whether the radio
waves would interfere with them-that
is strike them crest to trough so as to
nullify them even if they were mer-
cadons statement of the tremendous
power and the extremely short wave-
length they were using gave me hope
so i inveigled him into trying out the
transmitter i knew of course that
what little interference there might be
would not seriously affect the surface
tension-not even enough for the jap-
anese armies to notice it but i hoped
that it would affect the tension-indicator
enough to alarm mercadon and cause
enough commotion to enable us to
escape it was only a chance that the
relatively puny power of the transmit-
ting station would affect the gargantuum
power of the tension energy at all-
but it worked

  i cant figure out yet why a man
of mercadons ability would slip up on
a detail like that but its just one of
those things that happen to the best of
us

your head will do to hold your ears

                        conclusion

bruce turned to philips tom
theyre sending out the gen-
eral call  everyone knows
the plan

          yes bruce they are
beginning now i think he turned
around and looked at the long row of
electroscopes fifty men seated before
fifty sets of apparatus were watching
fifty different scenes these fifty were
all equipped with small projectors cap-
able of throwing voice and if neces-
sary a small scene quietly low voices
were speaking into the projector trans-
mitters all of the freedom mem-
bers will begin at once to carry out
their parts under the general plan-
name after name was ead out all
over the city the leaders were sending
out their signals the search of the
city was barely well under way it had
not been called off by any means but
now-it ended abruptly from eighty
thousand apartments two hundred thou-
sand people began to mill outward in
a moment the polshin guards were sur-
rounded by masses of men moving with
such a deceptive air of slow determina-
tion that the polshins who had never
seen a planned directed resistance did
not comprehend then they tried to

use the tactics that had always served
against the few half-hysterical attacks they
had witnessed their shock-rods glowing
they advanced on the nearest of the
plehbs ordering them angrily back
around each polshin six or eight plehb
men appeared young powerful plehb
men calmly they walked up to the
polshin guards crackling discharges
of electricity sprang from the shock-
rods-and rolled harmlessly off of
the blue suits of the plehbs the free-
dom scientists had fulfilled their prom-
ise insulated suits had been distributed
helpless the polshins were disarmed
by men twice as strong as they were in-
dividually and numerically a hundred
times as strong

  it was a wonderfully well organized
movement of the three thousand jeven
hundred and forty-two polshin guards
in that city that day only three hun-
dred and eleven were killed sometimes
-hate was too strong and every plehb
of the freedom movement was equipped
with death-dealing weapons now some-
times a plehb would recognize in a cap-
tured polshin the man who took away
his mate or his daughter took her
into the horrible slavery which everyone
of them had witnessed time and agc-n


slowly her nose pointed downward while a dint red glow rose to
incadeseence telling of broken power-leads

on their telectroscopes and from the
least lowest vertebrate through all his-
tory every male has fought hardest and
most savagely for three things life his
mate and his offspring and of those
perhaps his mate should come first
never would so unified a movement have
been possible without the telectroscope
to show what happened to those poor
creatures who were taken by the pol-
shins it was a wonder so few were
killed perhaps more would have been
murdered had it not been that most of
these polshins were young men some
from foreign cities and nearly all as yet
unmarked by any plehb as his own prey
and bruce and his companions had
worked hard had taught and lectured
sought to prevent the venting of veng-
ence as cruel as anything the polshins
did in some degree this had been ef-
fective too but most of all many and
many a plehb had but a few minutes
before seen that a polshin need not nec-
essarily mean an utterly cruel beast that
day carl manning saved a thousand
lives

but in half an hour nyak was in
the hands of the plehbs utterly
and completely nyak underground
that is for above ground the pol-
shins were prepared with the first
sign of the active rising the polshins
had set up their defenses according to
the rules their forefathers had lain down
great ion guns were mounted before the
mouth of every surface tube the power-
controls had been cut-but the plehb
mechanics this time had destroyed the
effect to be brought about by this move
before it was made five material en-
ergy generators each no larger than a
man had been set up and were supply-
ing all nyak with abundant power
they had been set up and connected in
before the polshins had cut the power
controls

  anxiously bruce conferred with the
men in other cities in not every dty
had the rising occurred only in those
which felt certain of success eight of
the cities of the union were still under
the rule of polshins polshins patrolling
in squads with light ion guns under
their arms

  but bosn shkago felfya all the
cities which had been in the union or
any length of time and possessed any
number of proton-guns had revolted
the proton-guns were trained on the
surface tubes by plehbs where they were
not ready to drive out the polshins un-
aided and ion guns covered the tubes
in cities where the plehbs had the bal-
ance of power in some places both
forces protected the tubes

  nyak was ready for the next step
overhead the telectroscope showed
atomic cruisers roaming ceaselessly
watching for any sign of attack on
the ground the surface crews in the gun-
tanks their mighty mounts crawling
over the gardens and crushing orna-
mental bridges prepared to aid the de-
fense to keep the rebel plehbs below

  bruce piloted the freedom i as she
sailed up through the hidden unsus-
pected lock the plehbs had built in-
stantly two huge atomic cruisers bore
down on her their mighty ion-guns
flaming destruction the stone of the
lock crackled in terrific heat and the
ground seemed to burst into flame but
the freedom rode calmly nearer the
ion-flame splitting widely and washing
off of her magnetic shield a rain of
the accumulator shells burst in intoler-
able flame on the outer surface of her
momentum-wave driving field

  no material thing could reach the
freedom ships one two finally four
of the fighting ships of the nyak union
had appeared a dozen great atomic
cruisers clustered and now their heavy
radio-frequency beams began to bore in
the conquest of the planets



effortlessly the slumberous giant of
material energy smashed the ten million
horsepower beams of the atomic cruisers
to flaming static discharges

  bruce moved slowly his fingers closed
on the proton gun release from the nose
of his ship a blue-green tongue of en-
ergy so stupendous as to be beyond
measuring drove out five hundred
feet through the air the first discharge
crashed its way the two billion volt
protons crushing the molecules of the
air to hydrogen and sweeping them
along the electron discharge smashed
out then swiftly the alternations built
up like a slow-licking solar promin-
ence the unbelievable flame reached out
-so slow seeming yet so swift the
fleeing atomic cruiser vanished suddenly
with but a slight alteration in the awful
flame her magnetic shield was not
built to resist two billion volt protons
nor the nearly two billion horsepower
that drove them

with a long-drawn roar of thun-
der the column the beam had
built up for itself in the air clapped shut
as bruce cut off his proton tube there
was not so much as dust to fall back
when it died and now the flame licked
out again stretched and another cruiser
puffed into pure blazing hydrogen gas
and mother earth sent up a great
tongue of her own lightning in protest
a tongue of power feeble and unreal in
the frightful glare of the released giant
of matter

  the atomic cruisers were fleeing to-
ward the nyak fortress now after
them the freedom ships sent a flight of
tiny bullets bullets that glowed strangely
as they tore along at speeds greater than
meteors leaving only the smashed ions
of air to mark their tail driven from
momentum-wave guns they overtook
the flying cruisers as readily as on old
time rifle bullet overtook an airplane

one touched a cruiser instantly with-
out sound save the soft puff of a rising
tongue of blue flame the tail of the
cruiser seemed to condense collapse
upon itself then melt away disinte-
grator bullets had destroyed it-bullets
that released electrostatic fields of such
unimaginable intensity that the matter
near them was torn to atoms not nois-
ily and flashily for noise and light are
escaping energy but so efficiently that
they were quiet only the gaping hole
in the tail of the cruiser told the story

  slowly the five hundred foot ship
halted as the air resistance stopped her
slowly her nose pointed downward
while a dim red glow rose to incandesc-
ence telling of broken power-leads she
vanished altogether in five more sections
as other bullets struck her

  and bruce turned and looked in
vain for another enemy four freedom
ships rode unharmed in the air the
polshin atomic cruisers were gone no
wreckage no broken bodies remained
only clear air

  and that day at mars center a
scientist with a peculiarly fresh youth-
ful face and deep age-old eyes smiled
as he told the president of the martian
state what he observed earth will re-
deem your pledge to her soon john the
seven centuries you mentioned have
passed today my instruments were
upset badly at first i thought a solar
disturbance had done it it came from
the direction of earth it was an elec-
tric field-a field of an intensity we
have never produced whatever caused
it anything within its influence must
have been reduced to sub-atomic par-
ticles

  bruce lawry looked down at the fort-
ress the ten-foot tungsto-iridium walls
loomed grey and stolid in the sunlight
a thousand feet in diameter four hun-
dred high the fortress was scarred here
and there by the wars of the old days


amazing stories

but nothing had ever bitten deeply into
her layers of magnetic and radio-fre-
quency screening no shell had pierced
her no heating ray reached through her
screen a ship loaded with ultra-pow-
erful explosive had driven at her in sui-
cidal death but the explosive had not
reached her only flying fragments of the
ship

the nyak fortress was the most
powerful in the world out of the
range of its ion guns bruce was watch-
ing thoughtfully heavy rifles hurling
atomic explosives were firing angrily at
him a solid sheet of rippling flame
roared around him and despite its auto-
matic balances the freedom wavered
in their concussions bruce needed no
telectroscope to see inside that metal
walled fortress here was a steel-barred
cell a white bed and a mass of dark
wavy hair and a face with closed eyes
and warm half-smiling lips smiling
still in sleep over the joke played on
omallin the joke in which she was the
pawn behind those metal walls-

  and bruce could see also the dark-
haired slim doctor with a blank look of
stupidity on his face and a deep human
twinkle in his dark eyes also behind
those metal walls manning deserved
bruces deepest consideration but more
still by the side of manning bruce
seemed to see dozens scores of polshin
figures stalwart men-men for all that
they were polshins bruce had preached
a doctrine and believed it despite what
had happened he could still believe it
some of the polshins in there were as
truly victims of the system as was he
and any plehb victims of a system
that taught them utter inconsideration
for plehbs

  and that fort was not like the atomic
cruisers the fort was practically un-
limited in its power even though de-
pendent on atomic rather than material

 energy the fort could draw tremen-
 dous volumes of the cold clear water
 from the broad river flowing near by
 volumes great enough to carry away even
 the millions of horse power that would
 be lost through the inefficiency of the
 atomic engines then-there was no
 reason why that fort should not de--
 velop two billion or two hundred billion
 horse power at least for a short period
 true they used metalic conductors un-
 aided by the space-columns of the free-
 dom ships-but they used the ten-foot
 metal wall as a conductor for one polar-
 ity as bruce knew the other was led
 through silver pillars ten feet thick
 bruce felt sure he could have reduced
 it with a few hours struggle eventu-
 ally even those mighty metal conduc-
 tors would have given way for when
 atoms fight against energy conducted by
 space the warp and woof of the uni-
 verse the outcome is foredoomed his
 four cruisers could have arranged them-
 selves broadside to the fort allowing
  both stern and bow proton-tubes to come
 into action each ship turning the full
 power of those frightful ultra-atomic
 beams driven by forces that made and
 broke suns eight colossal tongues of
 energy then the magnetic deflectors
 of the fort would have been loaded to
 the uttermost and bruce had still an
 untried weapon-the magnetic field with
 these raised also to their maximum
 draining and weakening the field of the
 fort-

   bruce frowned earth would tremble
 to her core under the opposing stresses
 of those titanic engines her metal heart
 would strain upward and twist convul-
 sively nyak felfya bosn even piz-
 bur and shkaga would be endangered by
 the upheavals resulting nyak founded
 on a rock though she was would slip
 slowly into the sea for below far below
 the deepest level of the dty was the
 great geological fault line
 the conquest of the planets



  yes-bruce knew he could crack open
that fort two things would happen
nyak and the territory for at least
five hundred miles around it would
writhe and strain under the pulls of
those struggling titans and-when
finally the magnetic and electric defenses
ot the fort tell ttiey would inevitably
fall abruptly like an electric light bulb
when the fuse blows out and as quick-
ly the hundreds of billions of horse-
power struggling to break down those
invisible walls of force would wash in
-and through beneath them the ten-
foot walls of practically infusible metal
would vanish as a single magnificent
tongue of burning hydrogen gas the
walls-and lora lora and every
human thing within it

slowly bruce looked at the men
quietly waiting for his word with-
out speaking he timed in the stage at
freedom hall philips powr a half-
hundred others were looking at him
watching him

  i can break open the fort in either
a thousandth part of a billionth of a
second-or within six hours in either
case no single thing within that fort will
continue to exist for even the briefest
part of a second after the walls fall
and-nyak will slide into the sea and
mother earth will strain and heave with
the forces i must use but-i could do
it what are we to do

  we cannot say replied powrs you
are in complete command of all fight-
ing bosn has reached the same posi-
tion shkaga and felfya they are
waiting for your lead

  i will come there decided bruce
three ships remained circling the fort
steadily the fort was sending out streams
of every form of destruction they knew
effortlessly the matter-giant brushed
them aside a tractor beam designed in
the old days to pull down a full-fledged

atomic battleship reached out and tugged
at one of the freedom ships till the
rocks of nyak ground protestingly on
each other effortlessly the material
energies neutralized the pull with the
greater power of the momentum waves

 bruce returned slowly to freedom
hali tyrcy wd won- aw rvot won
it was stalemate now what solution
could they reach the plan lora had
mentioned  somehow that did not cover
the conditions it had seemed so simple
and right to call down two ships from
felfya to from bosn and two from
shkaga and combine to destroy the fort
in that thousand billionth part of a sec-
ond bruce had mentioned now-new
understanding new contacts had changed
the conditions

  slowly bruce stepped down from the
hundred and fifty foot ship as it landed
in its berth

chapter xii

 i suppose omallins image on
the freedom hall stage was say-
ing irritably those animals are
observing us have we no privacy what-
ever left

  bruce could not resist the tempta-
tion his image appeared on omallins
right hand but now he reduced his
image to a foot-high figure no omal-
lin you have nothing any more neither
privacy nor power

  omallin started violently and pulled
his hand away hastily then he swatted
heavily at the foot-high image-and his
hand passed through it unhindered
furthermore bruce continued we
can crack that fort of yours like a rotten
egg any time we want to

  hah omallin snorted angrily i
didnt notice that you did it a fort is
a very different thing from a light atomic
cruiser

 our freedom ships are also very
different your stupidity is too great


amazing stories

for me to convince you short of actual-
ly destroying it and then of course
you would no longer exist i may truly
say that in all probability you will die
unconvinced 

  animal for centuries we have
proven our superiority and when for
five minutes you gain some slight ad-
vantage you presume to claim the con-
trol

  bruce shook his head slowly ani-
mals-human beings you are an animal
also omallin a swine i think we are
not only five minutes ahead of you we
are five thousand years ahead we have
all the civilization earth ever had at our
disposal and with this very machine i
have seen the face of the men living on
the planets from mercury to jupiters
moons

  we have all you ever had all we
ourselves have developed-and all the
things that the planets have developed
through the seven long centuries while
earth slipped back and back to the vicious
feudal system that produced you do
you know that your polshin president
mukarty in washun is also in the great
metal fortress there-surrounded by
circling ships just like those over your
heads your polshin power has fallen
in some places advance is slower since
our organization is so new therefore
we are waiting yet a little

  the planets the planets i impos-
sible roared a polshin councillor i
have read the science of the old days
and i know that no possible telescope
could show such scenes

  bruce laughed gently the latest rec-
ord you have is surely seven centuries
old look-and decide this is mars
center in the place of bruces image
on the table in the nyak fortress ap-
peared a ten-inch globe of mars a
globe that revolved with a majestic
slowness that lent even this tiny image
a mighty grandeur the globe expanded

till it was five feet through then slowly
the edges faded till only one city mars
center with its looming stately towers
showed

  then this vanished and jupiter with
his nine moons great and small ap-
peared grew and the great sprawling
city jove centered on the table

  and bruce reappeared seven cen-
turies the planets have advanced-and
we have done a bit ourselves

  i am troubling to speak to you only
because certain of the polshins within
your walls are fit to live we can of
course destroy that fort--but we would
destroy some worth while lives even
a few of our own

  if you will lower your magnetic
shields we can promise life to some of
you and all of your people will be
tried justly before a court of the men
from the planets do you know the
pledge of the planets did your ances-
tors take down the words of john mont-
gomery that day when interplanetary
left earth they have waited and they
will help earth now take down your
walls and accept trial otherwise-

  otherwise snorted omallin your
bluff will fail in all the wars of earth
wars that would makeyour puny rebel-
lion laughable this fort was never so
much as endangered

  and-otherwise you will have to kill
nearly three hundred of your own animal
species including this lora who seems
to be one of your leaders

  i have a proposition in return
omallins fat lips smiled we can ex-
ist here forever as you know we like the
gardens however so i will make this
proposition we will begin at once and
for nearly a whole year we can keep on
killing one of your animals each day-
and all day long the third one can be
this lora for she will awake then if
you gain wisdom you can turn over to
us one of your ships your leaders and
the conquest of the planets

n

these seeing machines in return we will
consider giving you certain privileges

from beyond bruce in the freedom
hall came a mighty angry roar of
sound it echoed through the transmit-
ter and into the metal-walled room
where omallin sat a plehb jumped up
beside bruce and furiously he denounced
the polshins for every plehb you
harm-ten of the polshins we have cap-
tured shall die as they die

  omallin shrugged it is not i he
replied that is the difference between
such animals as you and a polshin

  your stupidity is too great sighed
bruce returning to his position as the
furious man was drawn away i was
afraid you would believe nothing how-
ever i will give you two days to con-
sider it also we will communicate
with others of the people within your
fort

  the first plehb shall begin to die
now roared omallin rising to his feet
and shaking his fat fist at bruces fig-
ure and she shall pay for those repeated
insults

  bruce cut off the switch slowly his
face grey he turned to the freedom
audience and spoke slowly there
seems to be nothing we can do there
is only one hope and a faint one but
i will try it i have been studying at
the university on mars central these
past months-perhaps i have gained a
new viewpoint that may help other-
wise-there is nothing i can do since
that is so-perhaps-it would be better
-if we did not watch omallin for a
while

  bruce left the platform and hurried
away to his laboratory his fellow sci-
entists were arriving rapidly now return-
ing to their work bruce called them to
him and rapidly gave to each of them
an experiment to perform-all directed
toward one end and he himself worked

at the one determining key experiment

  each faint sound in the laboratory
each hum of apparatus and sound of
low voices seemed to ring shrill in his
ears shrill-shrill as a tortured wom-
ans scream heard through echoing cor-
ridors

  bruce shook his head and concen-
trated on the delicate task before him
presently lathes began to turn and the
cry of the cut metal brought back the
shrill ringing impatiently bruce tossed
his head then bent lower closer to his
work

  hours passed swiftly reports came in
from outside reports of progress in
bosn and shkaga in cities from san
friso to myami everywhere polshins
were bottled up in fortresses cut off
from communication with the rest of
the world by the washing roaring static
that the material energy engines were
setting up now no radio waves could
penetrate it and frightened polshins con-
ferred and trembled but land-lines
deep buried and protected some secret
and hidden maintained communication
between cities on the continent all were
waiting for the nyak decision some
had decided to try similar tactics bruce
thought of that with an infinite pain
with freedom so near for those victims
-this

amd reports were coming from the
- scientists of the freedom labora-
tories in other cities freedom men
were working though here in nyak the
best were gathered under bruce work-
ing seeking to do what they had never
been able hitherto to accomplish

  the first day passed and now the
second dawned and ceaselessly bruce
worked on he would not sleep around
him other men drove themselves on but
one by one they were forced to drop out
as unsteady hands weighted by fatigue
jarred delicate experimeits into oblivion


amazing stories

  bruce would not stop but dr grant
finally stopped him with a bit of drug
in the food bruce allowed himself for
five hours bruce would sleep sleeping
so intensively he would wake refreshed
as from twelve hours of sleep his
assistant director carried on the work
glimpsing vaguely the trend bruce had
established

  it was late in the second day when
bruce woke furiously angry at first
then he realized dr grants wisdom
and slipped back into his place

  first the reports of outside affairs
came in half the polshins in the nyak
fortress were nearly ready to believe the
plehbs could do as they claimed the
rest were utterly unconvinced there
would be no yielding on their part
plehbs were animals

  a large polshin audience had dropped
in from time to time to witness omal-
lins-resistance manning had risked
his life for the plehbs and one hun-
dred and three plehbs slept now under
deltamorphium for the full three days
it allowed but manning was in a ceil
himself awaiting action on omallins
part

  a second victim was the object of
omallins resistance now he was adher-
ing faithfully to his program his first
victim had died for twelve and a half
hours

  hurriedly bruce turned to the labor-
atory reports he thought of lora not
of the one assistant he needed most now
but of lora faintly stirring to wakeful-
ness now as the drug in her veins was
gradually absorbed

  the laboratory reports were good-
but somehow something seemed lacking
rapidly his mind ran over every pos-
sible item that could help it was a
clearer refreshed mind

  and then in the way of mans mind
it functioned a dog learns a trick
slowly by elimination of those moves

which produce no results a man does
not do the thing at all-or suddenly
knows the whole secret and the direct
way to its accomplishment bruce saw

  with a sudden shout that stopped
work over all the laboratory he sprang
to his feet buck-hal-will-and
brady come here in syllables so
swift his hearers could scarcely follow
he told them what he wanted instantly
he turned to his task the problem
that had baffled them seemed solved

   in two hours the first of the apparatus
began to arrive the new devices in-
stantly bruce and his assistants began
setting it up attaching it to the great
telectroscope in freedom hall in
three hours half the work was done
in four it was completed new appara-
tus untried in connection was ready
the transfer of all the electron waves
was to be attempted the transfer of
not merely one ten-thousandth part of
the whole-but all of it

  i dont want to try it on a human
-even yet-

  yes you do bruce there is one
human- interrupted powers and
we may hope by this time-that it fails
in her case

slowly bruces color drained from
his cheeks with a steady hand he
adjusted the great machine focussed it
and turned it on a room appeared in
the nyak fortress a bare metal room
with a half-dozen scarlet figures five
of them were polshins scarlet because
of their clothing the sixth-

  bruce worked with all the rapidity
he could muster one of the polshins
was wrapping electric resistance wire
around the sixth figure a bound softly
moaning figure cautiously bruce ad-
vanced a control and a light hazy out-
line surrounded the sixth figure on the
freedom hall stage under bruces
manipulation the haze condensed and
the conquest of the planets



only the additional solidification told of
the added apparatuss work abruptly
bruce drove home a plunger switch a
mighty humming roar echoed through
the great auditorium the straining pull
of the matter-giant as the entire struc-
ture of the universe was altered by
one small fraction

  then it died died as abruptly as it
had come on the stage the sixth form
crumpled slowly to the floor the five
others started back in amazement and
terror-then rushed forward to pass
their hands through the spot where the
material physical body now lay bruce
had set up a new electron-wave pattern
and instantaneously the electrons the
protons then atoms that had made up
that girls body simply werent
where they had been but in a new posi-
tion-on freedom hall stage

  dr grant was kneeling over the blood
stained figure she was moaning no
longer bruce joined him tense and
white slowly the doctor turned his
face up to bruce im sorry bruce-
life is too marvelously delicate a balance
for the titanic forces you need to hurl
matter out of existence and back into
existence elsewhere it was not her con-
dition the vitameter shows that every
individual cell is dead even the lowest
types the hair cells and finger nail
cells-though that may be because of
what they did to her

  i think that you have set yourself
an impossible task bruce how much
power did you use in doing this
three and one-half hundred billion
horsepower hours i killed her

  she would thank you bruce you
know that but dont you see that such
a titanic power-more than even this
whole city uses in a year-is too much
for life to be associated with

 when will lora wake grant
asked bruce softly

  grant looked at his wristwatch she

should wake about now or soon bruce

  i will bring her-when she wakes
slowly bruce sat down he looked
at the great machine with dull eyes
utter quiet reigned in freedom hall
a pair of soft-shod hospital attendants
came and covered the body on the stage
softly they carried it away

  every eye seemed turned on them as
they walked unhindered through the
immaterial images that were dashing
madly about on the stage noiseless un-
real

  then bruce began to laugh softly
and with such genuine merriment that
dr grant turned to him with a face
suddenly whiter and more drawn than
before bruce looked up at him with a
smiling teasing face there was noth-
ing insane in that face

  no im all right grant every-
things all right you see just for a
moment i wasnt thinking because every-
thing was so concentrated on that
hope of bringing lora out of the for-
tress that way but just think-look

  again bruce was at the controls
-lx in an instant the scene had shifted
it was loras cell now the girl stirring
slowly to consciousness on her bed
bruce projected himself and his image
bent over by the side of loras bed

  lora he said lora dear-its
bruce slowly the lids raised the long
lashes curved upward

  bruce-the joke worked didnt it
she paused suddenly fuller conscious-
ness returned and the laughing glint in
her eyes changed they were suddenly
very intent and thoughful bruce what
did you call me

  i called you lora-lora dear do
you mind

  oh- sudden animation came to
her she sat up abruptly clutching the
blanket to her then-then im not-
your laboratory assistant


amazing stories

  bruce laughed softly i suppose you
are-but thats not all you see

  with that point settled other things
could reach loras consciousness she
saw for the first time the steel bars that
had been there when she dropped off
into the long sleep bruce-where am
i in the same place there was
fright in her voice now ive been
here two days you couldnt get in
not till five minutes ago lora i
have now though i can transport mat-
ter entire by the process transport it
as far as i can project an image of nor-
mal size

  then you can get me out

  a cloud came over his face no
lora i have tried it and it wont trans-
port life dr grant says the forces
involved are too mighty for life to en-
dure i tried once but-but the ex-
periment failed its all right though
because you see dear no substance in
all the universe can endure these forces
see your bars bruces image van-
ished from the cell but there was a
sudden enormous tension a tension that
seemed to draw at her very soul quietly
without a sound the great steel door
dissolved away-quietly as the noiseless
ships of the freedom union-the quiet-
ness of the matter giant at work

  bruce reappeared i have other
work to do with this now omallin
wouldnt surrender i couldnt break
down his magnetic defenses without
rocking earth to her heart so now i
must leave you for a brief while
dear while i finish the work i
will bring you a white robe of the
freedom union and a telectroscope
and the twin tubes before i go though
he melted away again and where he
had been a white robe a small telectro-
scope and the twin pistols of the free-
dom union came gently into existence
laughing in her heart lora rose and
went to them

  fat omallin was quivering and order-
ing and shrieking threats and vengeance
two score polshins most of them young
polshin guardsmen were watching the
performance with growing signs of dis-
gust the more omallin realized their
feelings the more their barbs penetrated
his thick intellectual hide the more he
disintegrated his eyes were wide and
frightened in their folds

  gradually a cold silence fell about
him and his voice died slowly into sil-
ence too steady hard-eyed gazes were
bent on him these young men saw in
him for the first time the weakness and
degeneracy that he represented

  a low voice spoke spoke from the
air disgusting performance omallin
it wont do you any good anyway i
told you i could crack that nut-shell of
yours anytime i wanted to omallin
will you come down to the power-room
with me

omallin shrieked as a solid some-
thing pushed him gently fast as
his fat legs could carry him he ran for
his own private room a solid some-
thing turned him aside at the doorway
pushed him forced him toward the
power room whimpering his face
glazed with a cold sweat he was forced
along there was solidity in the image
now not absolute solidity but enough
to force him

  behind him trailed some forty-five
polshin guardsmen down the corri-
dor they went then down an elevator
that mysteriously took on volition of its
own down to the depths beneath the
ground level into the lowest level of
the nyak fortress there was a great
smooth humming roar here rivers of
cold water nearly five million gallons a
minute were rushing through the huge
pumps the great atomic generators
hummed and chuckled softly to them-
selves the half-dozen polshin war-
the conquest of the planets



techs who ran them seeming tiny
amonk their grey bulks long silver
columns led across the vast cavern to
apparatus on the same titans scale

  i didnt want to do it said the voice
calmly because we would have wracked
old mother earth in the doing so ill
do it this way ill take burner i of
bank a first i think-

  bruce wasnt gentle this time and
besides instead of merely bringing it
back to the nyak hall he was throw-
ing it away out in space a hundred thou-
sand miles from earth the soul-wrench-
ing tension built up and suddenly there
was a terrible ear-tearing scream the
scream as of a living animal in pain
almost-

  the outlines of the first of the great
generators faded away in its deep in-
terior they could see the burning fires
then-the fires blossomed in a sudden
explosion of heat and light for the bil-
lionth part of a second a vast flower
of blue-violet flame

  then there was nothing only the
thunderous roar of the air rushing in
to fill a sudden vacuum

  there were ten of those thunderous
roars ten times the whole vast nyak
fortress shuddered to them and in
her cell fifteen floors above lora smiled
as she heard them bruce was not be-
ing gentle as he tore the living heart
out of the nysik fortress

  i think youd better start back said
bruce im going to take two of the
pump battery now omallin realized
suddenly that the solid thing had released
him his legs pumped desperately up
the ramp to the elevator it would still
work as the lights still worked for the
accumulators remained intact and charg-
ed behind him he heard again two
roaring blasts-and a new sound the
sound of thundering rushing water
water draining in the opened forty-foot
ducts from the hudson and the atlantic

presently as the elevator loaded to
capacity began its slow rise omallin
heard the crackle and spit of shorted
electrical circuits

  his face was pasty when he stepped
from the elevator at his own level the
polshin guardsmen were still with him

  and-the voice was still with him
it was hard now hard and grim and
stem omallin i wanted jgu to see that
and to know your power was definite-
ly crushed omallin you are something
so savagely horribly monstrous so ut-
terly inhuman and beyond human con-
sideration so far gone in the depths of
the degeneracy the worlds need you
you should be preserved for all time
so that men may know what they can
fall to

i

omallin didnt get the sense of
what bruce said he only heard
the worlds need you -and preserved
for all time and a look of cunning
hope spread over his face the eyes
slitted once more-perhaps a bargain
remained to him-life and plehb girls
too perhaps-

  his face remained that way bruce
saw it and realized that never again
could he hope for so perfect an expres-
sion a terrible tension built up in the
room a tension that leapt and crackled
in static discharges like miniature light-
ning roaring and snapping driving back
the polshin guardsmen from about
omallin and omallin remained rigid
the same expression fixed on his face
but slowly something was happening to
him as the matter giant tore and strain-
ed and pushed at the atoms that made
him he was shrinking and his color
was fading slowly he shrank and
slowly the color faded and a strange
luster came a dull silvery luster-
three minutes passed before the ten-

the planet it has been your duty to iso-
late from all contact with her sister
worlds waited and wondered what things
were going on

  six months ago our scientists first
announced that they had detected across
all the gulf of space the tremendous
force-fields you were using and for the
first time the centuries of waiting seemed
insupportable

  in the pledge of the planets seven
centuries ago i promised that the planets
would help earth in settling her prob-
lems i said you must come with a
new ship bringing a new invention
you have come bringing such gifts as
we have never imagined possible you
have shown us exact images of planets
circling a star three hundred and fifty-
seven light-years distant you have
shown us matter at the heart of the sun
and matter in the very nebulae

  and unaided earth has all but settled
her own problems

  it is earth who should welcome us
back into the intercourse of planets
montgommery paused then from the
table he took a small metal key for
long seconds he looked at it then slowly
raised his face to bruce la wry

  seven centuries ago i watched while
this key was cut i wondered then how
long it would lie in our vaults

  today i brought it out you can-
not know my happiness in giving to you
this key to the sealed chamber never
again will i have to pass that closed door
with the memories and thoughts i have
endured

john montgommerys age-

fresh youthful face were burning
with a light of happiness bruce lawry

  you bruce lawry can have no con-

zjtfillions for defense

by miles j breuer md

we are very glad to give our readers a story by dr breuer he will be
remembered by our readers as a favorite author of many years standing
and in the near future we shall have the pleasure of giving more of his
works this is one of those stories whose finale can never be successfully
guessed at you have to read it to the end

 wfs about time you quit fooling
around and got down to some
real work youve been tinker-
m ing long enough

        the coarse red face of jake
bloor spread into an unsympathetic leer
and he grunted contemptuously

  i promised your mother id put you
through school he continued now
im through with that and a big bunch
of boloney i call it

  that was the welcome that awaited
john stengel after graduation from col-
lege upon his arrival at the only home
he had that of his uncle who was a
banker in the small country village of
centerville

  yes sir replied john biting his
lips

  his uncle screwed his lips into ugly
rolls around his cigar and then took it
out and spat on the floor

  this job im giving you in my bank
he went on is not a part of my prom-
ise to your mother that comes out of
the kindness of my heart

  that mind can and does triumph over
matter was demonstrated again by the
fact that john did not turn on his heel
and walk out of the house never to re-
turn john stengel known to his fel-
low- students for four years as stein-
metz stengel stood five burly inches
above his stocky uncle his blue eyes
blazed a resentment that was every-

where else concealed by his quiet and
respectful bearing the powerful arm
that bent to run his big hand through
his yellow hair could have knocked his
corpulent uncle off his feet but it
dropped quietly at his side and he again
said

  yes sir

  for graduation is a bewildering ex-
perience the world is wide and one
is not sure just which way to turn a
fifteen-dollar a week job as a clerk in
a country bank was nevertheless a dis-
couraging jolt to the rosy aspirations
that flowered at this time of the year
quite as brilliantly as did the roses for
behind him were four splendid years of
distinguished achievement as a scientific
student

  however just now there seemed no
way around it the offer of this job
from his uncle had come several weeks
before jake bloor had not presented it
kindly nor gracefully he had rubbed it
in with patriarchial magnanimity and
with conspicuous contempt for johns
scientific training which he had per-
mitted only because of his promise to his
dead sister when she had placed the
child john in his hands during the
weeks between his uncles offer and the
date of graduation john had thought
hard and tried everything especially
he had discussed the problem with his
fellow-students and his instructors


amazing stories

  he saw kicking struggling writhing screaming figures rolling on the floor
  and just in front of his tellers window his uncle was squeezed flat in a cage

of bronzed bars
millions for defense



  he had nothing else to fall back on
his parents had died when he was a
child and left him nothing but the ill-
natured promise of a grumpy uncle
he had tried in vain to get a position
of any sort but the country was in the
grip of the most severe financial depres-
sion of the century no positions were
available anywhere his failure to lo-
cate anything in the way of a livelihood
after several months of correspondence
during his last year of school was not
surprising with ten millions of unem-
ployed in the nation the bank-clerk
job even though it was offered largely
as an insult to johns scientific training
seemed like a straw to a drowning man
it had occurred to jotyi that jake bloor
was prosperous even while other coun-
try banks were failing

vxur uncle seems to be a good
business man and it will do you no
harm to learn something about busi-
ness one of his student friends said to
him

  keep up some scientific reading the
dean of the engineering department
said to him but by all means take the
job keep your laboratory hand in
practice somehow

  the dean was much interested in
johns future and consulted with john
at length about the matter

  you will get there in the long run
the dean said but do not permit your-
self to become stagnant

  the suggestion of johns roommate
who was as brilliant and clever an engi-
neer as john himself seemed to offer the
most promise of interest

  these country banks simply invite
robbery bates had said perfectly
simple to walk in and help yourself-
you mean that i ought to rig up
some stuff to protect the shack in case of
robbery  good idea john was in-
terested

  easy enough wouldnt it be and a
good way to amuse yourself

  and hansie dear dorothy had said
to him i know you can do something
great no matter where you go this is
only temporary and well be patient and
some day we shall have that home to-
gether

  dorothy was at the same time the
light of the world and the hardest
problem of johns life they had de-
cided that they could not live without
each other and yet here they were find-
ing it impossible to live together but
as dorothy held on to his arm walking
with him across the campus in the moon-
light and held her soft brown head
close to his and gazed at him with lim-
pid sympathetic eyes john felt that he
could and must accomplish anything in
the world for this wonderful girl that
a kind providence had given him

  centerville was certainly a drab and
dismal place after the glitter of life
on the campus whose great picturesque
buildings had thrilling things going on
in them here there were half a dozen
tiny business buildings strung out along
two sides of the dusty highway and a
score or so of cottage residences scat-
tered about and beyond those monoton-
ous prairie in all directions

  there were two general stores the
one in the brick building was carelessly
run and had a poor stock the other was
better arranged and more ambitious but
its wooden gable-roofed shack looked
almost ready to collapse in upon it
the garage was the busiest and most sys-
tematic-looking place in the neighbor-
hood two cafes in reality soft-
drink parlors one ragged and catering
to coarsely dressed men one somewhat
cleaner and filled at noon with high-
school students a hardware store with
dirty windows and a heap of nondescript
junk within them covered with the undis-

	turbed dust of years a drug-store with


amazing stories

its window full of patent-medicine and
cosmetic posters mottled by fading all
gave john an indescribably dreary feel-
ing of lostness and futility the traffic
that slipped down the highway all day
and the color and activity of the two
filling stations standard oil at one
end and conoco at the other did but
little to relieve him

  the bank itself made john think of
the little toy banks that children play
with and when he first set eyes on it
he was sure that it must have a slot in
the top to drop nickels in it was
square somewhat larger than a garage
with white-painted drop-siding and a flat
roof within it had iron bars across
the windows a single room divided in
two by a counter with a rusty iron
grill a big iron safe set on wheels the
floor was unpainted and splintery the
ink in the bottle on the sloping-topped
table at the door was dry and caked and
the pad of deposit slips upon it was
yellow and curled with age hardly
anyone passed along the little street all
day and only rarely stepped into the
bank itself between two and three in
the afternoon there were a few mer-
chants  saturday evenings there might
be three or four farmers in the bank all
at once

john smiled when he first saw the
place providing there were any-
thing to take it would be the simplest
and easiest of tasks for the modem
bank-robber to clean the place out and
get away it certainly looked as though
there might be something to take his
uncle jake bloors huge sprawling
white house brooded over the village
like some coarse temple and his big
throbbing cars glittered back and forth
from the city boasting insolently of
money it seemed especially insolent to
john because he knew there were count-
less unemployed who did not know

where their next meal was coming from
and countless others who were ground
almost fiat to the earth by debts and
losses at this particular time while his
uncle lorded it about without a care in
the world nor a thought for others it
did not seem fair that this crude heartless
man who had never done the world any
material service but had only selfishly
pinched off for himself generous por-
tions of the worlds money which he
had handled should be rolling in safety
and luxury at a time when men who
had invented and built and taught and
organized were being faced with grim
want things werent right in the
world

 john was young and human we
cannot blame him therefore for the
fact that when he did eventually get to
work to devise some scientific means for
preventing a robbery of the bank that
his motive did not consist of any over-
whelming loyalty to his uncles bank he
did it merely because he took pleasure in
the creation of something that would
operate the abstract idea in the
mind when the concrete working out of
it does things that can be seen and
felt-that is the thrill of the creative
spirit john loved his figures and his
drawings he loved the coils and the
storage batteries the clicking little gears
and the quick little switches that tickled
and made swift little movements of their
own accord as though they were living
and intelligent things

  for many long luxurious weeks he
did nothing it was a delight to be
merely a sort of vegetable to rest from
the rush of the last weeks in school to
shed completely if temporarily the
strain of looking into the future his
mind hibernated during that time and
lay fallow for it required no effort to
discharge his simple duties as clerk at
the bank and life in centerville was an
excellent anesthetic his body made up
millions for defense



what it had missed in exercise by long
walks down the highway and along the
railroad tracks long letters to and
from dorothy punctuated the soothing
monotony and the thrill they gave him
was all the excitement he wanted they
must have been good letters as we might
have judged could we have but seen him
lip off into solitude on the first oppor-
tunity after their arrival his face break-
ing out in delightful smiles-only no
one saw him

  finally one day in the fall after the
heat of the summer was out of his
bones he began to get ambitious first
he put a coat of bronze paint on the
rusty window-bars and on the grill-work
of the counter

  looks like a new place in here
said old larson the town constable who
was the first one to come in and see it

  john smiled

  i believe my sixty cents worth of
paint will boost the confidence of the
banks depositors thousands of dollars
he bantered

  jake bloor guffawed when he came in
and saw it

  all right he sneered if you
want to waste your pennies that way in
this dump but i think youre a damned
fool

 this was not very encouraging
thought john for broaching the idea of
installing some equipment for protec-
tion against robbery he decided to say
nothing about it for the present and
await a better chance

  a week dragged out its length after
that and john began to get restless the
autumn coolness was beginning to be
stimulating and after his most excellent
rest john wanted to be up and doing
something using his hands and his
brain the matter of devising some pro-
tection against robbery in the bank was
constantly on his mind he turned over
in his head various projects he

watched his uncle constantly hoping
for a chance to mention the matter

then one morning the city daily
came in with two-column heads
about the robbing of the bank at athens
forty miles away three masked men
had walked into the bank in the middle
of the forenoon one had forced the
clerk to hold up his hands at the muzzle
of a pistol while the others had cleaned
out the safe gotten into a car and dis-
appeared eighty thousand dollars
worth of cash and negotiable securities
had vanished no trace of any kind
could be found of the robbers

  i could rig up some stuff to prevent
that sort of thing in your bank john
said forcing his voice into a casual tone
over his pancakes

  prevent what growled his uncle
your bank being robbed like the one
at athens john said

  oh and a couple of grunts from
the uncle

  doesnt it worry you  it might hap-
pen to us you know john was show-
ing anxiety in his voice-whether for
the fate of his uncles bank or in his
eagerness to be at some technical work
again he could not tell

 oh i suppose and jake bloor
went on reading

  do you mind if i fix up some ap-
paratus to protect you

  all a bunch of humbug jake bloor
exclaimed impatiently gnawing at his
cigar the swindlers are always after
me with the stuff they want to sell
something thats all

  no i dont mean for you to buy
anything john urged vth make it
myself

  his uncle roared derisively

that would cost more than ever
it wouldnt cost you a cent john
explained holding down his anger with


amazing stories

difficulty after a moments silence
he regained his control

  if you dont mind he continued
ill fix it up for you at no expense to
yourself

  youre a damn fool jake bloor
sneered but go ahead and have your
fun only look out and dont do any
damage thats all i care about

  he got up and walked out of the
house in the door he stopped and
snorted back at john

  and dont kid yourself too much
those fellahs are on to these tricks
before you could kick off your alarm
they would have you shot better take
care of your hide 

  john thought it over as he walked
to the bank that morning

  if he invites robbery i ought to let
him be robbed he thought but if
he should be robbed as it is probable
that he will be his bank being the rich-
est as well as the most rickety for a long
distance around where would my job
be and as four months writing of
applications all over the country hasnt
got me an answer where would i be
without a job seems that it is up to
me to protect the bank whether he wants
it or not

  then his mind turned to the techni-
cal parts of the problem and began to
rim quickly about among them

  i believe he is right too he thought
about kicking off an alarm under the
counter that is an old dodge and
the robbers are probably ready for it
there must be a way around that

  for a solid month john was happy
he was the same old steinmetz stengle
whom his fellow-students gibed at and
at the same time loved so well going
about in an abstracted gaze studying
some complex problem in his head
or spending every spare moment of the
day and many hours at night with the
slide-rule and drawing-instruments and

with tools and materials giving some as-
tonishing child of his brain the outward
concrete form that was necessary to
make it a visible and functioning thing
among men packages in corrugated
paper and wooden boxes arrived for
him at the little railway station and
there were a few automobile trips to the
city

  when the thing was finished it dif-
fered vastly from the usual burglary
protection equipment nevertheless it
was quite simple the keynote of it was
a row of photo-electric cells just above
his head which received daylight from
the window behind him and permitted a
steady flow of current from a storage
battery whose charge was maintained by
a trickle charger from the lighting cur-
rent this storage-battery current held
down a relay armature anything that
cut off the light from the photo-electric
cells would shut off the storage-battery
current release the relay and set off
the works

ttthen he had gotten it made thus

  	 far he tried it out several times
by raising his hands above his head
while he stood at his window as though
he were facing a banks customer

  hands up his imagination supplied
the robbers command

  his hands went up there was a click
and the three one-quarter-horse-power
motors began to whirr

  the usual device in the country bank
is a big alarm bell on the outside of the
building this had been a conspicuous
failure in a number of recent robberies
in the neighborhood those who were
summoned by the alarm came too late
or did not have nerve enough to inter-
fere in one case the accomplices on
the outside had found it a convenient
warning to help them get away and in
another they had held all the arrivals at
bay and made a good getaway with the
millions for defense



booty john discarded the idea of the
alarm bell to awaken the village and
looked for an improvement on it

  a drum of tear-gas supplied the solu-
tion one of the motors operated by
the relay was so arranged as to shoot a
blast of tear-gas right across the public
side of the bank room just where the
hold-up men would be standing a tele-
phone-pair to the city fourteen miles
away rented at two dollars a month
comprised the next step over these
wires he arranged for an automatic sig-
nal in the sheriffs office which would
announce that the bank was being
robbed just as soon as the storage-bat-
tery current was cut off by the raised
hands in front of the photo-electric cells

  a second motor set off by the relay
located in a box under the building
closed the outside door and shot an iron
bar across it to keep it closed john
also reinforced this street door by screw-
ing to it a latticework of iron straps
and painting them neatly

  he felt highly thrilled the evening
that he gave the apparatus its first trial
he tried it after dark and therefore
had to put a strong electric-light bulb
into the street window to replace day-
light and instead of tear-gas he used a
drum of compressed air he rehearsed
the whole scene in his mind the door
burst open by masked men the pistol
stuck in his face and demand hands
up he put his hands up in as natural
a manner as possible and his delight
knew no bounds to hear the relay click
so softly that no one not looking for it
could possibly have caught it he was
even moderately startled at the sudden
loud hiss of escaping air and the street
door slammed shut in a ghostly man-
ner he walked around in front of his
window in the latticework on the coun-
ter and felt the compressed air from the
tank still blowing right across the place
where the imagined robber was standing

  that ought to have been enough it
was amply sufficient to take care of any
robbery that might have been staged
but john had a third motor at hand and
some vague idea in his head there
was still something lacking though he
could not quite put his finger on the
lack for several days he was uneasy
with the half-emerging thought that
there was still something that he ought
to add to this but try as he might
nothing further occurred to him the
arrangement as he had it seemed to be
enough and that was all he could think
of

  he therefore demonstrated it to his
uncle one evening jake bloor said
nothing which was unusual for him
he was rarely silent it may have
meant that he was impressed it may
not he did manage to keep the con-
temptuous look on his heavy red face
but he walked out without having said a
word the next morning he threw the
newspaper sneeringly across the table
at john who was eating with his head
bent down thinking of dorothy john
glanced at the captions announcing that
another bank had been robbed and that
the bank clerk who had been in league
with the robbers had handed out the
booty and wras also under arrest

  good idea drawled jake through
his nose combine that with your
plan load up the robbers nicely and
then turn on your tricks with a gas
mask you can take the swag off them
and hide it before the police come-

iohn heard no more his mind was
busy again he saw the danger to
himself and as never before he ob-
served the paltry meanness of his uncles
character there was some deep sublety
in jake boors sarcastic persecution of
the earnest ambitious boy which john
could not comprehend that jake hated
john seemed to be clear but why and


amazing stories

why had he gotten him there apparently
at his mercy for the purpose of getting
him into trouble the only thing that
john had to go on was that his uncles
old patriarchial conception of the hon-
or of the family had been hurt when
johns mother had run off and married
a poor but clever mechanic that was
in the eyes of all her relatives a
mortal sin not even possible of expi-
ation by her unoffending son

 but johns mind ran more to
mechanisms than to the tangled personal
relationships of the family a few days
of hard thinking convinced him that
there was only one way to protect him-
self and that was to include himself
in the field of the tear-gas he would
have to take his medicine at the same
instant as did the rest of them one
october afternoon out on one of his
walks he strode down the highway into
the dusty sunset and ahead of him a
farmer was raising a tremendous dust
in a field getting together with a horse
hay rake a lot of old weeds for burning
as the farmer moved his lever and
pulled his lines the row of curved steel
tines beneath him poised and waited
and then pounced upon their prey and
john got an idea he thought of a
use for his third motor

  he was soon busy again in his im-
provised workshop putting together two
affairs that resembled big hayrakes each
as tall as a man but the tines were of
rigid steel and when they closed toward
each other they could grip a man as
tightly as a huge steel claw and hold him
immovable he installed these one on
each side of his tellers window at the
counter with the motor under the floor so
arranged that it could rotate them against
each other and slip them past a catch
which would lock them firmly together
when the photo-electric relay went off
anyone standing in front of the window
would be raked in clutched and held in

a steel fist six feet tall yet when these
claws were turned back out of the way
painted with bronze paint they mingled
with the bronzed grillwork of the coun-
ter and were hardly noticeable

  for some time jake bloor had been
talking of taking a trip west for a
several weeks stay there was no men-
tion of the purpose of the trip and
it was discussed in a sort of secretive
way causing john to half suspect that
his uncle might be bound on a bootleg-
ging expedition but he cast it out of
his mind considering that it was none
of his business he was too worried
anyway to think of that by jakes
stern admonitions about bank affairs

  john was thoroughly frightened for
jake bloor held him closely responsible
for the veriest trifles as well as for the
largest affairs and yet had not properly
inducted him into an adequate knowledge
of the banks affairs it was an unfair
position for john and he felt like a
blindfolded man walking a tightrope
across a chasm he was just trusting to
luck that nothing went wrong before
his uncle returned

  dont pass up any good loans his
uncle growled at the breakfast table on
the day of his departure but if i
find any rotten paper in the vault
when i get back ill wring your neck

  john said nothing but was determined
in his mind to loan nothing and sit
tight waiting for his uncles return
for he could not tell good paper from
bad his business was engineering

  ill stop at the bank yet before i
leave jake said with an air of thrust-
ing a disgusting morsel down an un-
willing throat

  about the middle of the forenoon
the loneliest time of the day john
heard his uncles car drive up in front
of the bank he could see suitcases
strapped to the rear of it two men
walked into the bank along with jake
millions for defense



one of them carrying a large suitcase

  jake bloor drew a big pistol and
levelled it at john with a sneer

  well lets see how your plaything
works he said in a hard ironic voice
john protested vigorously

  tear gas is no fun-

 do you suppose i really want a
dose of it his uncle roared
dont you dare put up your hands
keep them on the table where i can
see them no kid tricks either 

 his grim harshness now alarmed
john

  im more afraid of that big pistol than
of the gas john protested again his
voice stuck in his throat and lights
danced before his eyes the whole busi-
ness was such a shock that he could
not puzzle it out though his brain
roared like a racing motor in the effort
to make head or tail of it that thing
might go off and hurt somebody
damn right it might his unde
growled thats why you had better
be careful and not play anything on me
keep your pretty hands still or til
ruin them with a bullet now turn
around march over to the vault and
bring me the tin boxes with the cash

and the bonds -go on damn it 

i	mean it

  jake snapped the hammer of the re-
volver and john turned with consider-
able alacrity and went after the tin
boxes of valuables in the safe his face
was pale and his hands trembled the
weakness of his ingenious plan was
being shown up unmercifully his uncle
had no learning but was diabolically
clever in a practical way john now
expected to be the butt of his cruel
sneering for weeks to come

  i guess you win he laughed nerv-
ously at jake i give up my ap-
paratus was no good and the laugh is
on me

  jake stamped violently on the floor
by god i told you to get those
boxes of bonds and cash if you think
im fooling youre due to learn some-
thing in about ten seconds this bank
is through do you know it

  john reasoned rapidly the only thing
to do was to go ahead if it was a
joke it would be interesting to see how
far it would be carried if it was
not a joke what else was there to do
anyway after all life on nothing
with no prospects was still considerably
better than a bullet through his vitals

  and dont touch anything and keep
your hands down low jake reminded
him with a thin ironic leer in his voice
if you dont believe ill shoot just try
something

  like a magician on the stage anxious
to show that he has nothing up his
sleeve john avoided touching anything
but essentials and touched these clearly
and gingerly he handed over some
 worth of negotiable valuables
from the safe truly a princely sum for
such a tiny bank the idea occurred
to him when it was too late that he
ought to have had some sort of trip or
switch or button in the safe itself that
is if it were really too late perhaps
this was just a good chance to discover
the defects of his apparatus and elabo-
rate upon it if this were only a test
he was certainly learning rapidly his
head was already full of improvements
and he was willing to forgive the grim-
ness of the joke for the help it afforded

  the two other men held john covered
with pistols while jake bloor stowed
away the tin boxes in the suitcase

  now jake said again in that of-
fensive thick-lipped sneer i suppose
you have been wondering how i am go-
ing to get out of here and keep you
from pulling something well its like
taking candy from a baby

  he approached the window again


amazing stories

 keep your hands down on that
desk he commanded

  jake bloor took out his pocket knife
and went for the wire that was con-
cealed on the outside of the cage

 lookout dont--cried john in
alarm

  ha ha jake thoroughly enjoyed
his big laugh you thought i was
too dumb to notice that this was your
main feed wire from your battery
under the floor to your little light
bulbs hal ha hoi ho your old
uncles not so dumb

 but- john tried to protest

again

  he was too late

  shut up his uncle barked sharply
and keep your hands down

  o k joke or no joke thought
john its on his head

  he shut his eyes tightly and took a
deep breath

  jake cut the wire and yanked out a
big length of it which he started to
put in his pocket but he did not get
that far with it john heard the faint
comforting little click there was a
harsh hiss of gas the door slammed
ponderously shut and its bar clanged to
in front of the tellers window there
was a whirr and a clash loud screams
rent the air

  john could not resist opening his eyes
in spite of his knowledge of what the
gas would do to them just for an
instant before a searing pain cut fairly
into them he saw kicking struggling
writhing screaming figures rolling on
the floor and just in front of his tellers
window his uncle was squeezed flat in
a cage of bronzed bars unable to move
but only to give general twitching then
john got down slowly and lay on the
floor because of the stinging in his
eyes nose and throat

  a thousand swords burned into his
eyes he sneezed and coughed and felt

so miserable that he could neither re-
main on the floor nor stand up he
kept squirming and writhing about
he could hear the others groaning and
writhing about and kicking the floor
and the loudest lamentations fame from
his uncle hung up between the steel
rakes but no attempt that he could
put forth was able to get his eyes open
which in spite of his pain he regretted
at that moment he would have given
years off his life for a sight of jake
bloor pinned up against the counter and
gassed with tear gas holding on to his
suitcase full of money

  it seemed a hundred years of flashing
stabbing misery before relief came
actually it was twenty minutes after the
breaking of the wire when the sheriff
from the city arrived with a car full of
armed men during this period no one
in centerville had awakened to the fact
that anything was wrong at the bank
john felt the breath of cool fresh air
and strong hands lifting him he was
too dazed to pay attention to what was
going on and submitted when medicine
were put down his throat he was in
bed for two days before he could get
about properly

  on the morning of the third day his
uncle came into the room a burly man
walked on each side of him in fact
his uncle hardly walked he was prin-
cipally supported and pushed forward
behind them came dorothy darting
around in front of them she had hold
of johns hands

  johnny-on-the-spot she laughed
and kissed him in front of all the
others thereby embarrassing him tre-
mendously

  but john had not missed the look of
anxious concern on her face for an
instant when she first came into the
room and before a quick glance told
her that he was in good shape he
was grateful to providence for her
millions for defense



  his uncle shuffled up to the bed
youre fired he attempted his
quondam roar rather anticlimatieally
he looked very much used up

  tush tush one of the big men
said we cant fire that boy we
still need him he was softly sarcastic
about it

  john looked at them closely they
were certainly not the furtive creatures
who had come into the bank that fore-
noon with jake bloor in fact he could
see the edges of shiny badges peeping
out from under their coats it was
only too obvious that jake bloor was
under heavy arrest

  but what i want to know one of
these big official-looking men was say-
ing is how you set off your stuff 
this guy says he had you covered and
that he cut your wires and pulled a
section out of it

  john laughed heartily and long

  my uncle is clever he said when
he could finally speak but he missed
a slight though important fact that
wire supplied a current from a storage
battery and as long as that current kept
running everything was peaceful it
was the breaking of the current either
by shutting off the light to the photo-
electric cells by hands up or merely by
cutting the wire that set off the relay
and turned on the tricks

  oh-h-h said jake bloor faintly

  i tried to tell you- john began

  never mind one of the big men
said well tell him but now we
want you to come to the bank

  john dressed and went to the bank
where he again found his uncle and the
two men these two showed a persistent
fondness for close proximity to his

uncle they would never permit him to
move more than a few inches from
their sight there wrere also two
smaller men going over the books

  as i thought said one of the latter
flat failure v

  one of the big men shook jake

co you had the balloon punctured
 and were ready to skip he said
quietly that wont sound good to the
judge well anyway theres enough
cash in your bag to pay off your de-
positors with-unless we have to divide
it among those of the other banks he
has robbed around here

  robbery and embezzlement both
said the other deputy thatll be about
a hundred years at leavenworth

  he turned to john

  you will be required for a witness
so stay where we can reach you i
understand that the loss of this job is
tough luck for you well heres
hoping you have no trouble finding
another

  they all went out bundling jake
bloor with them john and dorothy
were left alone in the bank

  with startling suddenness the tele-
phone rang shrilly it was long-dis-
tance calling from the city

  are you the young man who devised
the apparatus that caught the robbers
in this bank this is the palisade
insurance company and we need some-
body like you on our staff can you
came into the office and discuss the de-
tails of your position thank you
john and dorothy looked into each
others eyes that home of dreams
was becoming a reality at last

zora of the zoromes

by neil r jones

in presenting another of neil r jones jameson stories we are acced-
ing to the desires of many readers who have expressed the wish for more
of professor jameson and the zoromes again we are with these strange
beings and we follow professor jameson in his adventures with them
who seems to be quite content with the strange society with which fate

has thrown him into contact

chapter i

princess zora

 a nd we left the region of
dead worlds and cooling
-a suns crossing space to zor

 i m professor jameson con-
       cluded

  with no adventures between the
time you left the sunless world and
your arrival here asked zora

  we made several stops in the few
systems we passed but nothing out-
standing befell us nothing worth the
telling

  princess zora of the zoromes turned
her head and looked far out upon the
distant horizon away from the apex of
the mighty citadel on which she sat lis-
tening to the adventures of this fasci-
nating convert to the ranks of the ma-
chine men of zor she was a sentient
flesh and blood zorome representative
of the species from which the brains of
the machine men were taken zora had
many years yet to live before the official
time arrived for the transposition of her
brain to a machine body zor main-
tained a propagating species to replace

the expeditions of zoromes that never
came back and renew the numbers of
those depleted expeditions which did re-
turn the machine men who had gone
forth under the leadership of x-
and returned under u- had finally
reached zor the home world

  the machine men discovered that
they had been gone for more than
twelve hundred of mms earthly
years most of this time had been
spent near the planet of the double sun
where more than half of the expedition
had been killed the remaining zoromes
were marooned there for centuries

  professor jameson convert to the
machine men the last representative of
earths long dead civilization found
himself with princess zora mcxii to
whom he was relating the adventures
and discoveries of the expedition she
in turn explaining the mysteries of zor
and its sister planets to the interested
professor

 mm you have told me how
x- and his expedition found your
dead body in the shadow of the dying
world and removed your brain to one
of the machines stimulating your men-
some of the zoromes remained in the two ships which were just disap-
pearing under the layer of gushing substance applied in red-hot streams
from long nozzles held by machine men tubes leading off into the heart

of the building


amazing stories

tal processes into life and activity once
more zora radiated you have re-
lated how half the expedition was wiped
out by hypnotic impulse on the planet
of the double sun i have heard your
story of your seven centuries of cosmic
solitude in the wrecked space ship wait-
ing for the tripeds to come and release
you yet the most interesting tale of
all you have barely touched upon your
invasion of the blue dimension the res-
cue of your comrades from the ocean
pit your adventures inside the hydro-
sphere and your trip into time interest
me less than your own personal story
you have finished your account of the
wandering world now tell me about
your rocket satellite and how you ever
came to conceive such an idea

  zoras large eyes with their long un-
derlashes stared inquisitively at the
professor her six tentacles undulating
gracefully as she shifted herself to a
comfortable position preparatory to
hearing the anticipated story of pro-
fessor jamesons interment in space

still little thoughts in the profes-
sors mind beyond the perception of
zoras mental attunement rapidly com-
pared her with earthly standards of
pulchritude the standard which had ex-
isted during the earlier half of the twen-
tieth century to staid earthly inhabi-
tants of forty million years past zora
would have appeared as a weird mon-
strosity yet her features her curved
undulating lines and graceful waving
tentacles were harmonizing and sym-
phonious to the eye

  from four pronounced callosities two
on each side of her upper body four of
zoras tentacles grew long and tapered
to tiny tips two more tentacles one in
front and another in back at right
angles to the flanked tentacles com-
pleted her six upper appendages below
this upper area of tentacles her body

assumed vase-like proportions then ta-
pered to four short legs unjointed
which curved outward from the base of
her body to terminate in three-pointed
feet

  zoras head was large and stately
though not out of proportion to the
size of her body a high fringe of
membranous tissue grew across her head
from cheek to cheek like a thin waving
coiffure beneath and in front of this
below a well fashioned forehead deep
dark eyes sparkled with curiosity long
lower lashes drooped over several inches
of her face devoid of what the profes-
sor would have described as a nose the
machine men knowing such a facial dis-
figurement in their travels from world
to world as a probocis

  a diamond-shaped mouth opened in
amazement from time to time as the
professor told his story the tale of the
rocket satellite zora possessed no ex-
ternal ears her faculty of distinguish-
ing sound was located in the back of
her head behind the waving membrane
whose thin points arose star-like from
the deep-pink fringe her respiration
process was accomplished through tiny
valved openings at the base of her fore
tentacle

  my work of a lifetime centered
about rocket propulsion and i worked
long and hard upon experiments em-
ploying radium as a means of fuel the
professor explained in reply to zoras
question at the time i lived on earth
space travel was only a dream not yet
realized space travel came three cen-
turies after my death in 

  how do you know

  you forget the time bubble the
professor reminded her

  oh yes-to be sure

  a fascinating idea arose in my mind
one day and i thought of it so often
contemplating its possibilities that it
grew to be an obsession with me sup-
zora of the zoromes



planting much of my time at rocket
propulsion with a new type of experi-
ment in a radically different field pro-
fessor jameson continued the ab-
sorbing study which had so completely
captivated my imagination was immu-
nity to dissolution and decomposition
of the human body the human body i
knew like all other earthly substances
whether they were rock air water
metal or living matter was subject to
eventual breaking up of molecular struc-
ture into its constituent atoms it was
said in my day that should mankind
cease to exist all trace of his works in-
cluding the great pyramids and all other
time-defying products of his creation
would within a hundred thousand years
crumble into the forgotten past due to
the fact that subjected to planetary
conditions nothing can exist forever
of course the readjustment of atomic
structure is more rapid in the case of
organic matter than it is in the case of
inorganic material

a ray of sunlight spread shafts of
fire through the membrane on
zoras head as she sat absorbed in the
professors narration he resumed his
story

  in my search for a means by which
an organic body might be preserved in-
definitely following death i contem-
plated many ways and means abandon-
ing them one by one as i realized their
eventual impracticability at first i
went about trying to discover a serum
which might surpass that of the egyp-
tians creating its subject indestructable
to the various elements as well as pre-
serving it intact in appearance i gave
up this idea however for i saw that
not only would it require a longer life-
time than mine in which to discover
such a concoction but i realized that
no liquid no matter how perfect in its
embalming qualities would survive the

more violent forces of nature such as
earthquakes volcanic action and gla-
ciers not to mention temperature air
moisture and minute organisms for a
time i considered the possibilities of
immersing a corpse in a great block of
transparent glass

  several airships of zor passed low
over the citadel and the professor and
zora paused momentarily to contem-
plate these then the professor once
more continued

  i was chasing an old art since the
days of the pharaohs the human race
had sought ceaselessly a means whereby
their dead might be preserved against
the ravages of time great was the
art of the egyptians in the embalming
of their deceased a practice which be-
came lost in the chaos of earths chang-
ing history it was never rediscovered
but even the embalming of the egyp-
tians was futile for the preservation of
their dead down through the millions of
years their dissolution being just as
eventual as the immediate cremation of
a corpse

  tell me said zora were there
others of your kind who practiced this
art

  england of the seventeenth century
practiced a crude method of embalming
to serve a grim practical purpose
smugglers were hung to gibbets along
the coast their bodies coated from time
to time with tar and pitch to preserve
them as long standing examples for
other smugglers who dared approach
the english coast with their illegal trade
some of these grisly lonely sentinels
were known to stand duty for fourteen
years their dissolution was a drawn
out affair unveiled clad only in rent
canvas through which protruded the
emaciated knee bones these tangible
spectres crumbled slowly to dust in the
summer and fell away to mud in the
winter when they finally became no

longer serviceable they were replaced
with a fresh specimen

  i finally came to the conclusion that
nothing on earth is unchangeable beyond
a certain limit of time and as long as

i	looked for an earthly means of pres-
ervation i was doomed to disappoint-
ment it was clear that i could never
accomplish my purpose if i were to
employ one system of atomic structure
such as embalming fluid or glass to
preserve another system of atomic struc-
ture when all atomic structure is eter-
nally subject to universal change 

 lj aving arrived at this definite

   conclusion i looked for a means
by which a human body in the condi-
tion of death might be preserved to the
end of all earthly time to that day when
the earth would return to the sun from
whioh it had sprung quite suddenly
one day i conceived the answer to the
great enigma it popped into my mind
so unexpectedly that it left me awed for
at that particular moment i was not
thinking of the matter at all engrossed
as i was in a rocket experiment it
was a wild and uncanny solution and
for a moment i looked upon it as un-
attainable until i came to consider it
more thoroughly

  any material substance whether of
organic or inorganic origin cast into the
depths of space would exist indefinitely
at that time little was known of space
by mankind yet i was certain about my
theory this stupendous idea this wild
scheme appalled me with its possibili-
ties i had previously decided that
whatever solution i eventually arrived
at i would first subject myself to it in
the subsequence of my death dead i
had nothing to lose by such a venture
then too i thrilled to the pride of
being the first mortal ever to penetrate
the vast mysteries of the cosmic void
even though lifeless

  i visualized my dead body flying off
into the illimitable depth of space en-
closed in a rocket perfectly preserved
while on earth millions of generations
of mankind lived and died their bones
to moulder into the forgotten past even
as the illustrious egyptian kings even
as the obscure seventeenth century
smugglers until that day when man-
kind beneath a cooling sun would fade
out forever in the chill thin atmosphere
of a dying world and still in death i
would persist perfectly preserved

  the thought left me gasping in
open-mouth contemplation my brain a
whirl of fantastic thoughts then rea-
son asserted itself and i was no longer
the imaginative dreamer but once again
a cold calculating scientist turning over
the matter carefully under the scrutiny
of calm consideration i decided to
make my funeral rocket a satellite of
the earth furnishing it sufficient initial
propulsion to place it well beyond the
dangers of crashing back upon the earth
yet keeping it well within the earths
gravitational attraction i chose an or-
bit fifty thousand miles from the earth

  my only fears were the huge me-
teors which careen through space at a
tremendous velocity but i overcame the
possibilities of a collision with one of
these stellar juggernauts by the instal-
lation of automatic repulsion rays in
the rocket these repulsion rays i dis-
covered in my laboratory work only in
a vacuum this was another by-product
of my experiments with radium as a
space-rocket propellant these rays from
the rocket satellite worked only when a
meteor approached the proximity of the
meteor exciting into action the auto-
matic repulsion rays a transformer
turning sunlight into radium energy
kept my satellite protected through forty
million years whenever a meteor ap-
proached within a hundred miles or less
its immediate registration depending
zora of the zoromes



largely on its size these rays swerved
the meteor slightly to one side of the
rockets orbit in the case of the larger
meteors the rocket itself deviated tem-
porarily from its orbit to allow the pass-
ing of these colossal space denizens

  i left instructions for my nephew to
bring my body from the grave vault at
grenville cemetery to the rocket satel-
lite in the leaning tower projecting from
my laboratory he followed out my
plans to the letter i warned him to
leave the building after he had set off
the five minute timing device and i also
urged him to wait until the moon had
passed that part of the southeastern sky
at which the rocket tower was slanted

ow do you know that your plans
were carried out so well asked
zora it was forty million years after-
ward that my people found your rocket
satellite and recalled your brain to life
that i also learned with the time
bubble the professor replied you
will remember that on the way back to
zor we stopped on the earth and took
a trip into time

  tell me what is it like to die
you just lose consciousness said the
professor

  but what of this afterlife which cer-
tain intelligent types throughout the uni-
verse constantly affirm do you recall
an afterlife

  not definitely the professor replied
though strange hazy impressions were
scattered about my mind like vague
memories when my brain cells were
stimulated into activity from their long
sleep

  then you recall no life beyond
death queried zora toying with this
subject of mystery which interested her

  however ventured the professor
as if adding to what he had already
said the idea has been suggested dur-
ing my earthy life that the ectoplasmic

afterlife cannot exist independently un-
til after a partial decay of the proto-
plasmic cells so in view of the fact that
my body suffered no decomposition
whatever during its forty million years
sojourn in space my particular case
does not prove the non-existence of an
afterlife

  what did it seem like to wake up
and find yourself a machine man

  it was very strange the professor
replied when my senses returned i
thought that i was still lying in my
death bed-that i really had not died at
all but was returned from the region of
dark shadow and oblivion into which i
had relapsed imagine my consterna-
tion and dumbfounderment to find my-
self what i am now a cubed body four
metal legs six metal tentacles and my
brain incased in a conical superstruc-
ture most amazing was my ability to
look in all directions at once with the
row of eyes completely encircling the
base of my metal head an eye in the
conical apex affording me even upward
vision my sudden gift of mental tele-
pathy was also surprising

  someday i too will be a machine
man said zora

  how many years 

  roughly around ninety of zors rev-
olutions about the sun it all depends
upon my mental development and phys-
ical condition we are generally strict
about that it is not necessary for me
to wait it is merely preferable for i
find that life as an organic zorome is
pitifully small in comparison to my
anticipated career as a machine man i
shall make the change when my life-
time as a flesh and blood entity com-
mences to decline

  it seems strange that you will be a
machine man spoke professor jame-
son castiifg mental emphasis on the
male appellation though i understand
that the brain alone is sexless depend-

ant on a body to furnish its idiosyn-
crasies

 although the machine men of
zor are immortal to ordinary con-
ditions occasional accidents will befall
a metal head from time to time and a
propagating source must be maintained
to keep the species from becoming ex-
tinct

  we lost many on the planet of the
double sun said the professor in-
cluding myself there were five converts
to the ranks of the machine men of
the four tripeds we lost one of them in
a battle at the center of the hydro-
sphere

  converts do not always prove so sat-
isfactory as you and the tripeds mm-
 mentioned zora a troubled frown
mantling her face

  you mean that they fall below the
mental standard

  not that so much their ambitions
become colossal and they do not follow
the simple philosophic ways which we
zoromes find are the best means of con-
tinuing a sustained unfluctuating ex-
istence free from civilizations rises and
falls unlike life on your turbulent
planet earth where somebody fought
someone else all the time for greed and
petty honors at this very moment we
are in hostile relations with a world of
metal converts converts for whom we
are now sorry

  i had not heard of them before
said the professor tell me about it
it all happened since x- started
from zor with his expedition the ex-
pedition on which you returned mm-
 for a long time before we zoro-
mes had contemplated making machine
men out of a race of intelligent crea-
tures on the planet of a near by system
several light years from our own plan-
etary system we selected certain men-
tal types and the operations were suc-

cessful we gradually built their num-
bers into several thousands giving them
long life and prospective immortality
they had never before known and we
taught them the conquest of space

  but unscrupulous and ambitious
types among these mumes of mumed
tricked and cheated their way past the
inspections given each one before ad-
mittance to the operation several sub-
stitutions of subjects were made and a
malign self-centered opposition grew
among the mumes under clever propa-
ganda instilled by ambitious malcon-
tents of mumed the first break be-
tween zor and mumed arose when
insistent demands came from the mumes
to create more machine men than we
considered prudent and satisfactory

  we at once discontinued our con-
version of the mumes and this was the
signal for another of their ambitious
moves they had acquired from us suf-
ficient knowledge and art to make their
own brain transpositions and they im-
mediately severed all relations with us
warning the zoromes to stay away from
mumed

e did stay away knowing full
well that their isolation and dis-
regard on our part would prove a
most satisfactory end to our regretted
experiment but this isolation did not
persist space ships manned by ma-
chine men from mumed and by living
members of their species came and
raided zor and the other planets of our
system quite unexpectedly pillaging for
various scientific knowledge and appa-
ratus their dreams of empire and domi-
nance had demanded

  were they successful professor
jameson inquired

  by the surprise of their attack yes
zora explained but now zor and its
sister worlds are well protected ex-
peditions were sent to mumed to chas-
zora of the zoromes



tise and warn them against any further
depradations but to the surprise of our
expeditions it was found that mumed
had become a bristling fortress of de-
fense its atmosphere and surrounding
space well protected by automatic rays
and destructive forces of interplanetary
warfare

  they will eventually try and conquer
zor  said the professor it is plainly
obvious something should be done to
forestall them

  that is well realized zora admit-
ted at present constant work is
being done in the matter of espionage
through our recent application of an in-
visibility treatment of our space ships
this advantage of invisibility is a new
discovery contributed by one of our
recently returned expeditions when the
muraes become aware of what we are
doing they will probably counteract our
success of invisibility in some way or
other do not underestimate them
besides being excessively ambitious they
are cunning and shrewd especially those
who have been made machine men

  why not disintegrate their world
professor jameson suggested recollect-
ing the world of the dying sun they had
destroyed by progressive disintegration
on their way back to zor it is in
another system and it will solve the
entire problem

  that has been suggested before
mm but we are reluctant to do
it it would disrupt the entire system
more or less and this would prove fatal
to a race of creatures on ablen a
neighboring planet of mumed i refer
to the ablenox whom the mumes have
enslaved and have otherwise maltreated
if all else fails and if the safety of
zor and its civilization is menaced the
ablenox will have to take their chances
against the disintegration of mumed a
ship under bext has just returned from
mumed where several of their space

  ship bases were wrecked and a grim
warning left that further acts of truc-
ulence against zor would result in
space-war

  who is bext

  bext is my lover was zoras start-
ling announcement he has come back
from mumed with the distinction of
having proved himself a leader among
the zoromes

  your lover professor jameson ex-
claimed then momentarily he diverged
from this phase of the conversation to
put another question do flesh and
blood zoromes risk themselves to such
perils as bext undertook

  certainly they do replied zora
drawing herself up proudly though a
crew of machine men always accompa-
ny them ready to protect their mortal
bodies against harm

  but even so such a venture is dan-
gerous the professor observed for
bext and his fellows must breathe and
be allowed the conveniences otherwise
necessary to organic life

  he came back unharmed to me
spoke zora and he accomplished his
mission thoroughly

  your lover mused the professor
it is strange i knew long ago from
discourse with x- u- and
others of the machine men that an or-
ganic race of zoromes existed for the
propagation of the species but i was
never aware that beyond a feeling of
fidelity and comradeship a sentiment
existed among you

  did you not tell me that love was a
prime motive on your planet earth 
queried zora a bit imperiously do
you think that we of zor are so back-
ward as not to be versed in the finer
arts of sentiment you seem surprised

am surprised the professor ad-
mitted staring covertly at the snap-
ping eyes of the princess though not


amazing stories

because i underestimated you but rather
the opposite

  what do you mean queried zora
a bit confused by the professors non-
commital allusions

  i believed the zoromes far to prac-
tical and mentally stabilized to pursue
the veiled fantasy and deluding gran-
deur of love

  deluding challenged zora indig-
nantly what is there deluding about
it

  professor jameson regarded her a bit
pathetically then whimsically before
forming his reply

  stripped of its glamor its falsities
its hypnotic fascination love is the irre-
sistible instinct to fulfill a biologic urge
the seeking by half a species for the
other half bringing about the subse-
quent mating and eventual propagation
of the species in this manner fulfilling
natures law the professor explained
love rarely yields its fluorescent prom-
ises for like the bright petals of a car-
nivorous flower it brings its victims to
serve the wholesale ambitions of a far-
seeing destiny

  it is easy for a passionless mecha-
nism like yourself to think that out so
wisely and scientifically snapped zora
you were not always a machine were
you ever in love or did you always
mother such staid idiotic ideas of the
tender passion

  professor jameson felt amused at
zoras scathing sarcasm his sense of
humor represented a radical departure
from his fellow machine men a state of
mind they rarely understood now the
final question of the princess stirred
long dormant memories taking him
backward more than forty million years
to the little village of grenville his
attitude sobered how well he recalled
his one and only love affair the in-
spired devotion of a young man for his
promised one

  yes he admitted i loved once
and was loved

  tell me about it urged zora with
sympathetic interest vaguely discerning
a scarce mentioned secret veiled behind
the professors admission

  there is little to tell the machine
man replied i was young ambitious
happy my mind full of the ideals and
hopes of youth it was in this frame
of mind that i met mara the most gor-
geous semblance of womanhood it was
my fortune ever to lay eyes upon her
loveliness her gentle charm her sweet
fascination overwhelmed me and dizzied
my senses and i fell hopelessly in love
with her very soon after we met i
told her of my love one night while we
were together

  the unforgettable scene flashed into
the professors mind across the inter-
minable abyss of time and was clearly
shared in the mental perceptions of
zora she visioned a small lake in the
soft ethereal light of a low hung moon
down a shimmering path of moonlight
reflected from the calm surface of the
water dripping oars shed jewels spark-
ling with silver gently propelling a
small boat through the still waters the
prow spreading undulating ripples to
either side

  as seen through the professors eyes
the memory envisioned a white
wraithlike object sitting opposite him
the oars were lifted allowing the boat
to drift slowly on its momentum the
vision unmoving came gradually nearer
the professor had evidently changed his
position the boat unguided drifted
aimlessly turning so that the moonlight
shone full upon maras face

  starry eyes reflected the wonder of
the night matching the glory of the
far off stars so thinly spread through-
out the ghostly diffusion of a moonlit
sky a tenderness and expectation was
zora of the zoromes



apparent in the upturned face and
parted lips the face came closer
startling close and dark lashes closed
softly over the approaching eyes
nearer the face loomed until it became
blotted from the moonlight by a shadow
a shadow aocompanied by encircling
arms as if a shade had been sud-
denly drawn as if zora had closed her
eyes to something at which she was
looking the vision quickly disappeared

  we became betrothed the professor
continued the wedding was set for
a day in june

  the professor paused something in
the old memories had returned to him
passing swiftly to be gone once more
zora did not urge the machine man
sensing imminent tragedy to be related
she waited respectfully

  mara took sick and like a fragile
flower dimmed away slowly and i
seeing- her like this from day to day
could do nothing for her still young
a creature of celestial beauty she
passed away and tears did nothing to
bring her back the bloom of life
mysterious life had fled in its place
was an image of mara devoid of sen-
tient entity her hands were hard and
cold like marble she was buried on
what was to have been our wedding
day

  zora had caught her breath her
heart was full of sorrow a depth of
sorrow the machine man devoid of a
living heart could no longer feel

  her memory lived always with me
after that said professor jameson
i never wanted anyone else i have
often wondered if she were not waiting
for me on the other side the afterlife
we so recently discussed my body
was long ago destroyed right after
b- recalled my brain to activity
my brain still lives if there is a soul
it must exist in the brain where the
mysterious life force is contained and

sent ceaselessly through the spinal cord
to all parts of the body i have often
wondered should my brain be destroyed
would i find her waiting for me in a
place where time does not exist

  that happened forty million years
ago before the civilization of zor had
ever commenced even before the seeds
of life had ripened beneath our flaming
sun said zora it is a tremendous
length of time

  the depressing influence of the
dying earth the thoughts of mara and
this afterlife i have mentioned almost
drove me to jump from a high cliff
on earth headfirst when i found that
i was the last man on earth a brain in
a metal cast that mankind had gone
from the face of the earth ages past
but it was the kindly persuasion of
x- and his forceful logic that
swayed me in favor of a life of inter-
planetary exploration and adventure
else i would not be here with you
today

chapter ii

sister worlds for zor

ere comes bextl exclaimed
zora

  a zorome came walking out
upon the great edifice not a machine
man but a male of the flesh and blood
species unlike zora his body curves
were less accentuated while the fringe
of membrane on big head was a deep
red bordering on light purple this was
especially noticeable when sunlight
struck it as was customary with the
male zoromes his walking appendage
did not curve out from his body and he
possessed no eyelashes

  after a meeting with bext and a
short discussion with him concerning
the trouble with mumed professor
jameson left the two zoromes and
went in search of u- as he


amazing stories

disappeared around a broad column his
last sight of bext and zora revealed
a confusing intertwining of tentacles

  within the following days profes-
sor jameson learned much of zor and
its sister planets five in number turn-
ing on their endless orbits around the
flaming sun the machine man visited
all of them and came to know their
individual histories and peculiarities
with the exception of the innermost
planet poth they all possessed rota-
tions each planets year divided into
days

  poth was the only one not given over
to habitation by either the organic
zoromes or their machine-men an-
cestors it was true however that
poth contained valuable deposits which
were mined under synthetic conditions
and the darkened half was partly built
up and utilized for the refining of the
deposits

  next in order from the sun came
trach so hot that only machine men
were able to stay there it was a huge
manufacturing base beneath this
swelter of blazing sun organic zoromes
could not exist and when they did
visit trach it was always on the night
side or in the dusk or dawn the
planet was waterless an endless barren
desert of blowing sands towering
mountain peaks and cavernous canyons
merging often into broad abysses which
at an earlier date may have been filled
with water the atmosphere barely
warranted the name from afar in
space it represented a greenish ring
surrounding the planet possessing the
ability to absorb and hold the heat of
the flaming sun but incapable of sus-
taining any life on the planet machine
men were indifferent to these condi-
tions as long as they were not sub-
jected to excessive heat or intense cold
they cared little about the conditions
surrounding them 

  third from the sun was grutet the
smallest world of the system not more
than eight hundred miles in diameter
the professor estimated when the
zoromes had conquered space naviga-
tion back in the dim age-old past they
had found the world without an atmos-
phere later as their scientific
knowledge progressed they supplied it
with a manufactured atmosphere fertil-
izing the planets mantle and giving it
plant life that necessary balance to a
respiratory atmosphere

  but the planets gravity was so slight
that the atmosphere gradually drifted
away throughout the centuries espec-
ially during the periodic passings of
a particular comet this comet which
passed so close had been destroyed by
the machine men but even so the air
of the tiny world still continued to
drift away and so the machine men
had undertaken a colossal venture
they had enclosed the entire planet in
a hermetically sealed metal container
on examination the professor had dis-
covered this metal to be similar to
chromium rather an alloy which closely
resembled chromium

lyj- assive uprights over two hun-
dred feet in height spaced far
distant from one another loomed and
arched in all directions to support the
endless roof all kinds of climate in-
cluding rainfall the machine men dupli-
cated synthetically the ceiling was
painted luminous to render perpetual
daylight while in various sections of
the tiny world were transparent facings
to allow penetration of the suns rays
it was a curious world where machine
men of zor and their flesh and blood
counterparts resided together access
was gained through gigantic air locks

  it was remarked to the professor
that if grutet should ever cease its
rotation the chromium jacket would
zora of the zoromes



crush inward upon the planet instantly
the mighty columns set so far apart
were not primarily instrumental in sup-
porting this massive shell centrifugal
force and atmospheric pressure from
within carried most of this latter re-
sponsibility the columns performing a
small part of it largely maintaining a
stabilizing effect of the great shell in
relation to the planet it jacketed

  fourth from the sun was the planet
zor itself cradle of the life and civil-
ization which had reached its utopia
where an endless life as a machine man
lay in prospect for each individual at
the end of his organic span of years
zor the mother world was the most
magnificent of all it was artistic and
exacting to an extreme if the tiny
chromium-plated grutet was the most
brilliant and dazzling object in this
system surely zor was the most geo-
metrically beautiful

  viewed from afar it was just another
glowing planet but professor jameson
recollected the wondrous surprise that
had greeted his eyes when the returning
space-ship had approached within dis-
tance where topographical features be-
came detailed zor had appeared as a
large sphere brilliantly decorated in
strictly exact geometrical designs re-
course to the telescopes had transformed
huge oblongs into vast seas radiating
lines became broad rivers whose courses
had been guided by artificial channels
tiny spots of delightfully varying
colors were found to be important
centers of life while inset triangles
proved on close examination to be vast
plains of metal the work of centuries

  zor was second to the largest planet
in size its diameter a quarter again as
great as that of the earth its density
about the same the professor learned
the home world was given over en-
tirely to habitation culture and the
finer things of life when the machine

men on their expeditions spoke of zor

they generally meant the collection of
six planets but when they spoke of
home they meant the planet zor itself
here reigned the royal families of zor
from which new recruits were con-
stantly added to the ranks of the ma-
chine men

  dompt lay far outside the orbit of
zor and was the largest planet of the
system it boasted a pleasing climate
and the organic population of the sys-
tem would doubtless have preferred
this world were it not for the excessive
gravity which first tired them out then
prostrated them with exhaustion finally
threatening their lives gravity nul-
lifies were necessary all organic
zoromes who stayed there were com-
pelled by necessity to carry them con-
stantly to the machine men this
excessive gravity meant only an added
expenditure of the energy with which
they could constantly recharge their
metal bodies their parts wore out
sooner too on dompt and it was neces-
sary to replace them oftener

dompt was used largely for lab-
oratories and factories also as a
gigantic storehouse and museum for the
many wonders both in stories and
tangible curiosities brought back from
the expeditions into the unending en-
virons of the cosmic void from
myriad worlds afar museums whose
floors partly nullified dompts forceful
gravity held these curiosities and per-
petual thought transmitters which told
their long tales then repeated them

  this planet possessed the only moon
of the entire system in fact it pos-
sessed two tiny moons so close together
as to be influenced by each others at-
traction revolving around one another
while holding a steady orbit about the
planet dompt they were small and
unimportant suggestions had been


amazing stories

made from time to time that they be
disintegrated to facilitate interplanetary
navigation but a sentiment regarding
the queer antics of the friendly little
spheres acted as a brake against active
execution of their destruction

  it was the organic zoromes inspired
more or less by a sense of tradition
and romance who desired the main-
tain ence of the twin moons and this
highly respected minority generally had
their wishes in these matters that
too was tradition

  ipmates was the outermost world a
world cold and chill far removed from
the crisp stimulating climate of dompt
and still more distant from the summery
warmth of zor machine men alone
lived on this bleak planet with its per-
petual ice and snows its barren rocky
vistas like the siberian steppes its sub-
dued sunlight from a small orb in the
sky and its foul unbreathable atmos-
phere

  to all this the machine men were
totally indifferent they liked an oc-
casional return to the other planets but
for one who could not feel the dis-
comforts of such a world ipmats was
startlingly beautiful in a sad terrifying
sort of way the professors impressions
told him ragged mountains punctuated
the skies rising in procession grim
jagged and unending between lay the
valleys of snows and creeping glaciers
at night the stars shone scintillating
and cold when roaring blizzards did not
obscure them from sight of the machine
men the rare visits paid this forbid-
ding boundary of the planetary system
by organic zoromes were performed in
space suits if they emerged at all from
the roving space ships and transparent
bubbles which brought them

  this outermost world was the base
for interplanetary travel beyond the
system of worlds all expeditions were
made ready and outfitted on ipmats for

their ventures into the far flung
boundaries of the star-studded universe
all modes of warfare both offensive
and defensive were collected here and
subjected to constant experiment and
change the glowering blustering fury
of ipmats had been well chosen to guide
and foster the efforts of cosmic travel
and made it a spot where the fates of
worlds might rest according to the
keen balanced judgment of the machine
men of zor it had been this world
the professor learned that had suffered
the attack from the mumes

  during the interval between his visits
to the other five worlds of zors
planetary system the professor was
much in the company of zora and
bext he accompanied the latter on
several space cruises beyond the orbit
of the sixth planet the situation con-
cerning mumed was rather tense and
the zoromes were constantly on the
lookout for any belligerent tactics the
mumes might devise

  the professor found himself often
in the company of zora who exhibited
a never ceasing wonder at the anecdotes
the professor related concerning his
life on earth and the colorful pages out
of earths history besides what history
had accorded him in the matter of
earthly knowledge the professor also
traced rather vaguely the history of
mankind beyond the twentieth century
from what he had learned during the
experiment with the time bubble

he was telling zora one day of
mankinds exodus from the planet
earth to a distant world of sirius five
million years after the twentieth cen-
tury when a machine man broke in
upon them evidently agitated by the
state of his mind it was w-

  the mumes have attacked

  where queried zora and the pro-
fessor simultaneously
zora of the zoromes



  the cruisers p w- replied a
large force of mumes in their gravity
ships captured bexts craft

  the color drained from zoras face
her eyes widened while her tentacles
fluttered nervously she said noth-
ing her mental processes temporarily
stunned

  did they destroy the ship asked
professor jameson

  no w- answered bexts
ship was quite a ways in the lead and
after getting it in their power of gravi-
tational attraction they headed back in
the direction of their own system a
wide ray of devastating energy was
left behind them and radiated from all
sides to protect them from immediate
pursuit

  then the inmates of the captured
ship are being taken prisoners the
professor suggested

  evidently but zor will not stand
idly by and let them get away
organized pursuit wijj be too jate
to head them off said the professor
i understand that their ships are as
fast as those of zor

  exactly

  bext cried zora riven with
anxiety he must be brought back
before it is too late

  a great furore of excitement echoed
from one end of the planetary system
to the other over this impudent act on
the part of the mumes to show their
disdain of the zoromes they had pur-
posely captured one of the cruisers a
ship designed to keep a watch for their
intrusion the affair had been carefully
planned and it boded ill of what was
to follow the mumes it was apparent
had been bent on capturing the leader
who had come so mysteriously to their
world and wreaked havoc with one of
their principal centers as a retaliation
for their raid on the outermost planet
of ipmats

  a rumble of space war rolled omin-
ously from poth to ipmats centering
about the planet zor the home world
this last act was a defiant challenge
of the mumes the machine men of
zor suggested the entire destruction of
mumes yet secondary consideration
always brought out the danger to the
simple thriving race of ablenox re-
moved but two worlds distant from
mumes it would mean their entire
destruction before the planets of this
system ever became rebalanced on new
orbits

  such a cataclysm would shake the en-
tire orbitual system and alter it pro-
foundly

  n various quarters arose the
demand for the rescue of bext and
his safe return zora was beside her-
self with fear and anxiety for her
lover and threatened to seize a ship
and start for mumed herself a coun-
cil of war finally reached the decision
that before any acts of haste be made
a detailed examination of mumed be
consummated it was rumored that the
mumes had become proficient in the
use of dangerous rays and other pe-
culiar weapons with which the machine
men of zor were unfamiliar the
swift coup of victory in the event of
space war as popular opinion held
forth might not be so readily realized
professor jameson heard with satis-
faction the decision to send two space
ships invisibly clad even as the ship
bext had recently used in his concealed
trip among the mumes to the planet
mumed a double object supplied the
motive first of all the two unseen
ships must cruise about the enemy world
and learn all that could be discovered
concerning the planets defenses space
ships and the nature of the protective
rays which were reported to be used in
encircling the sphere rays which blasted

any object attempting to penetrate them
if bext still lived he was to be found
and brought back to zor

  u- was chosen to head one of
the ships he came to the professor
and informed him of his newly ap-
pointed capacity

  i am taking my old crew mm
which means that we who have sur-
vived the horrors met with on the planet
of the double sun who outwitted the
menace of the hydrospheres depth and
conquered the dangers of the sunless
world are off on a new adventure this
time a trip of espionage where
must restrain ourselves from aiding
bext until the last minute before we
leave

  if he still lives conditioned the
professor

  i believe he does u- affirmed
the mumes were too particular to take
him alive he was taken that way for
a purpose and it is logical to presume
that the purpose is a protracted one
information

  possibly

 who mans this other ship the
professor queried

 j- d- f- and
others totalling fifteen in all

  this invisibility professor jameson
asked how does it work

  it is a bath a strange coating which
completely covers the ships entire hull
mm it is something like the
ray you once told me that your own
species used during your earthly life in
acquiring translucent pictures of your
organic bodies this coating of ours
is much more powerful and serviceable
besides comprising a highly indestruc-
table substance it possesses the power
of creating transparency from outside
looking at the spot where our ship was
descending the mumes would see noth-
ing except the same starlit sky or un-
obstructed daylight whichever the case

might be we in the space ship will
notice no difference for we shall be
visible to each other as always and
everything beyond the ship will be
visible to us like zlestrims time bub-
ble the transparency works but one
way only in this case the conditions
are reversed

  professor jameson was no less
anxious than the other machine men
in getting under way for the planetary
system of mumed a comparatively
short trip across space the ship of
v- was to comprise sixteen ma-
chine men and four organic zoromes
while the other ship under j- was
to carry ten machine men and five of
the organic species of zor

t n the sheltered wall of a dark
looming pinnacle of massive rock
a mountain crag against the darkened
sky professor jameson saw two space
ships slowly disappear before his eyes
they were on ipmats a far off sun
reduced to the semblance of a small
golden ball still dazzling yet distantly
removed shed a subdued glow of sun-
set upon the towering crag which
etched in ice and snow lowered menac-
ingly over the squat buildings at its
base

  before these buildings were assembled
the machine men ready to set out upon
their secret expedition to mumed
several of the organic zoromes were
present in space suits others remained
in the two ships which were fast disap-
pearing under the layer of gushing
substances applied in red hot streams
from long nozzles held by machine men
tubes leading off into the heart of the
buildings

  a roaring of wind howled about the
great eminence as fitful gusts of air
so poisonous to the respiratory organs
of the flesh and blood zoromes raged
and tore over the melancholy landscape
zora of the zoromes



carrying veiled screens of fine crystal-
lized powder dislodged from pockets in
the rough surface and redistributed
among the conical heads of the metal
zoromes again the tempest calmed
ancf clear vision reasserted itsetf
through the intense cold intense to the
organic zoromes unnoticed and scarcely
realized by their metal brethren

  the two space ships finally became
lost to sight completely where two
metal hulls had reared their dark
opaque shadows upon the snow-crusted
mountain ledge there now existed a
clear view of the rugged escarpment
dropping away to the depth of the
valley jutting black rocks forcing their
irregular spires through the frozen ex-
panse above the machine men a door-
way suddenly opened against the starlit
sky blotting out an oval background of
glistening points now supplanted with
a solid layer of dull yellow light
another doorway opened still further
beyond the first the only evidence that
ships oi space occupied positions upon
the ledge more preparations were ap-
plied to the invisible exteriors of the
two ships

 all ends must be caught up and
tied said u- figuratively speak-
ing what they are now doing is to
render this invisible coating contagious
to any fine particles which may come in
contact with it otherwise particles of
dust picked up in the atmosphere of
ipmats and mumed or even those ac-
cumulative lnfinitesmal specks of space
which escape our meteoric repellers
would eventually reveal us

  effectually armed both offensively
and defensively the two invisible space
ships left ipmats for distant mumed
nor did they first return to zor they
left on a grim errand which was to
mean much toward the near future and
there was no celebration no heartening
throngs to watch their ascent into space

on what portended to be a desperate
venture behind them lay the dark
rugged fingers of rock upthrust from
the widespread desolation of frozen
barren surface ipmats dwindled into
a pale thin crescent then hdea from
sight

  across space they leaped across the
dizzying depth of the cosmos bridging
the light years distance between the
neighboring systems of zor and mumed
of the eight planets in the latter sys-
tem only two were inhabited by in-
telligent life mumed lay third from
the sun while ablen peopled with a
less advanced species than the mumes
lay fifth in line an intervening world
called tan id having its orbit between
the two planets

trom afar professor jameson and
u- examined the sun they
were gradually approaching already
it was the brightest object in the sky
and from a glittering point had become
a barely distinguishable orb w-
came up behind them

  something has been found he told
u- which warrants your at-
tention

  w-s frame of mind suggested
no alarm yet he purposely concealed
the motive of his interruption by a con-
centration of mental faculties it was
evident that he wished u- to make
the discovery for himself the pro-
fessor and u- followed w-
to the supply room of the organic
zoromes where boxes of foodstuffs and
liquids were kept

  one of the organic zoromes stood
in the center of the supply room but
it was none of the four who had left
with the expedition the first hasty
glance revealed that recognition
smote the professor and u-
simultaneously

  zora


amazing stories

  how did you get here demanded
u- recovering from his brief
shock and surprise

  i hid myself among these she
replied imperiously and unabashed
waving a tentacle airily in the direction
of several tall stacks of containers
but-why

  professor jameson did not have to
be told the answer to the question
u- had so confusedly framed he
knew zora well enough and her reply
came as he had expected it

  i am going to help bext i love
him

  but you are seriously endangering
your life-you-a member of the royal
house

  it matters little to me who i am-
without bext was zoras emotional
answer i am going to him

  u-i recognized the impossibility
of sane argument with zora while she
was in this frame of mind he turned
to the practical aspect of matters

  you stowed yourself away what
will they think back on zor when you
turn up missing

  they will know by now where i
am said zora i left word

  i have half a mind to turn back
u- suggested

  no pleaded zora let me go
too i can be a useful member of the
crew when we reach mumed besides
there is the other ship to think about
you cannot turn back now

  u- pondered the idea he be-
wailed this impractical madness which
afflicted organic zoromes its termina-
tion the eventual mating and subse-
quent propagation of zoromes was a
worthy and sensible goal he well
realized but what foolish senseless
deviations from cold logical reasoning
this disease of the imagination placed
upon its hopelessly implicated subjects

the professor catching the ex-
asperated thought impressions of
u- smiled inwardly u-
had no sense of humor since his trans-
formation from an ancient corpse
perfectly preserved in the cosmic
vacuum to a machine man professor
jameson had strangely enough dis-
covered that sense of humor was an
idiosyncrasy peculiar to people of the
earth he had run across few species
in his cosmic travels who were pos-
sessed of humorous qualities and then
such qualities generally ran to an ironic
tendency

  the professor and u- realized
mutually that zoras agony of mind her
fretfulness at delay and her own un-
bounded confidence in the belief that
she could personally be of great service
in freeing bext had forced her to come
both realized it yet the professor was
alone openly sympathetic to u-
it was an unforeseen circumstance of
troublesome consequence yet he ac-
cepted her presence as inevitable and so
zora became a part of the expedition

  tiny unblinking points of light be-
came planets the two ships of space
cloaked in their invisible mantels enter-
ing the system of mumed ablen was
passed as a growing crescent and left
behind and far to one side as a gibbous
orb tanid the planet between ablen
and mumed lay in opposition to its
bordering worlds past the orbit of
gigantic and uninhabited tanid the two
ships passed on their way in the direc-
tion of mumed which grew steadily
larger assuming the proportions of a
gigantic ball its topographical features
limned clearly under a cloudless atmos-
phere

  see those palpitating flickering rays
of light which sweep intermittently
about the planet u- inquired
we have to penetrate them safely in
order to cruise about mumed
zora of the zoromes



  they seem to expect us was w-
s ominous observation

  after what has happened it is not
trange of them to expect a retaliation
said u- but they are not yet wise
to our invisibility treatments of our
space craft and they will be looking
for us not using their proximity de-
tectors as thoroughly as they should
how can we ever get through that
destructive radiance  the professor
queried lifting his gaze from the
telescope levelled at the shimmering
spreading fields of light which blanketed
mumed with glowing transparency

  they have safety lanes where their
own ships may enter and leave these
safety lanes being opened and closed
at will we shall have to wait and fol-
low a party of their ships inside

 we cannot accompany but one of
their ships w- advised their
proximity detectors would spot us out
instantly even though they were unable
to see us what would be more startling
than to feel a ship about you some-
wheres when there was no ship in sight
our entrance will go unnoticed how-
ever along with two or more of their
ships

  it is not our entrance we are to
fear was u-s grim suggestion
it is our leavetaking which will prove
the more dangerous especially if the
release of bext is accomplished with any
great difficulty

chapter iii

war clouds

at a short distance the two ships
from zor cruised about the planet
 they had come to investigate
finally three of the enemy ships were
found far out in space keeping behind
their course at a distance which would
fail to register upon their detectors the
two invisible ships hung doggedly to the

flight of the three ships which were
circumnavigating their own world
those in command of the two unseen
ships felt satisfaction as the three ships
swung quite suddenly for a tiny glow-
ing spot on the planets surface where
the thickest radiations of light were
clustered there suddenly opened a break
in the destructive wall

  into this opening the space ships
dropped out in space the two
prowlers from zor sped close on the
heels of their quarry u- called
for a maneuver which brought them
midway between the first and second
enemy ships j- he well knew
would range his ship between the second
and last in line

 unaware of their unwelcome com-
panions and attaching no significance
to the queer behavior of their detectors
the three ships of mumed safely ne-
gotiated the passage through the rays
and into the upper reaches of the atmos-
phere they dropped ground-ward
while the two invisible ships from zor
hung far up in the air above the air-
ships and fliers which coursed their
routes nearer the surface as u-
had mentioned a collision of the air-
craft with one of their invisible ships
might start an investigation

  what about our thoughts queried
zora fearfully shuddering slightly at the
idea of revealing their presence

  it will require an effort of concentra-
tion to reach the mumes said w-
their mental perception was never as
keen as ours it is their detectors we
have most to fear and we expect to
arouse no suspicion near the planet be-
cause of so many other objects ap-
proximating our substance and bulk

  it is a strong temptation to wreck
that city below us mused c-
what a just retribution for their attack
on ipmats

  we would be in for it after that


amazing stories

the professor observed we are safe
just so long as we merely investigate
and do not show our hand

  where-where is bext zora asked
anxiously

  we must discover that at leisure
u- insisted his release is to
be our final act before leaving mumed
in the meantime there is much to be
learned of this world it has been long
since a machine man of zor stepped
friendly foot on mumed

  for days the two space-ships lurked
among the centers of life on the planet
mumed everywhere there existed a
martial spirit a grim preparedness
the zoromes not only saw but listened
as well they became acquainted with
the general plan of the mumes
roughly it was to continue depredations
among the planets of the zoromes until
the latter rose up in wrath and came
to mumed in a declaration of space
war the mumes preferred fighting
near their own base where the invading
forces would be at a disadvantage and
could be more easily annihilated zor
having shot its bolt would then be open
to conquest by the empire dreamers of
mumed

  professor jameson had his first view
of the mumes the machine men he
found as exact counterparts of himself
but as u- had explained their
mental perceptions were below the aver-
age of the zoromes the organic
mumes were strange creatures they
appeared to the professor as large
spiders with cranial superstructures
their globular bodies slightly flattened
at top and bottom were equipped with
eight jointed appendages while from
the top center of their bodies projected
a head a smaller globe atop the larger
one

  professor jameson also saw many of
the enslaved ablenox from the planet
alben they were great hulking

brutes of physical strength yet they

were no match for the machine men of
mumed their lesser intelligence was
obvious the ablenox seemed peace-
ful and slow to anger despite their
physical possibilities they walked
upright on two lower limbs their bar-
relled bodies possessed of four upper
appendages heavily muscled and ter-
minating in six digits arranged scoop
fashion

f umed was ruled over by a ma-
chine man a harsh dictator d
the mumes had copied the numero-
logical classification of their benefactors
and now their chosen enemies the zor-
omes but less than three generations had
been born since the first machine man of
mumed had been created and the
numeric distinctions ran low

  all was not found tranquil on mumed
in spite of the united cause d was
hastening the manufacture of machines
and cutting short the organic lives of
many mumes in order to equip his
machines with reasoning brains dis-
satisfaction reigned in many quarters
regarding this for several of the trans-
positions were unsuccessful and as
u- pointed out more of them
already changed to machine men would
come to grief due to the indiscriminate
mental inadaptability this very reason
had caused the severance of relations
between mume and zorome

  but these dissatisfactions were trivial
in comparison with the surging move-
ment of war-designs and the metal shod
feet of d figuratively stamped out
even the most timorous objection to his
aims d was a machine man and
unlike the esteemed regard the metal
zoromes bore for their organic brethren
on mumed the flesh and blood mumes
counted for little other than possible
material for the machines the metal
mumes became important with self-
zora of the zoromes



glorified distinction and d had be-
come drunk with the passion for con-
quest and power

  the secret investigation by the two
invisible ships from zor disclosed the
fact that the mumes depended little on
space craft for their anticipated war-
fare with the zoromes it was true that
many ships were being turned out by
the mumes but their greatest weapons
of war were located on the surface of
their world huge rays were to stab
accurately into space and annihilate the
attacking ships of zor at immense dis-
tances a startling feature concerning
the protective waves of destructive
radiance sent shimmering about the
planet from huge power plants was
brought to the notice of the unseen
visitors the wall of palpitating light
was impervious to the rays and other
offensive measures of the zoromes
the mumes felt reasonably safe behind
this transparent veil of death-death
to the operators of any space craft at-
tempting to penetrate it

  another new weapon was also dis-
covered among the machine men of
mume as luck would have it the
zoromes chanced upon a demonstration
it was a small gun for close fighting
that was what professor jameson
termed it a gun to the zoromes it
was an ejector of metallic destruction
evidently the mumes were anticipating
tentacle to tentacle combats with the
zoromes it was later learned that these
weapons were to be used in the counter
attack on zor following the destruction
of the zoromes space fleet

  these small side arms carried by the
mumes were metal-eaters their action
on a machine body the same as a mov-
ing stream of water on a bank of soft
mud aimed at the metal head of a
machine man for a few brief seconds
these pistols were truly terrible their
action was soundless and invisible no

light or other manifestation issuing
from the blunt concave end the gun
was aimed a slight pressure applied and
the metal target commenced to dis-
integrate over a surface of several
square inches

the two ships lurking unseen
about the various centers of
activity on mumed gave access to much
knowledge concerning the armament
and plans of the mumes overshadow-
ing completely all minority for peaceful
intentions rose a fever of activity a
conquest complex overweighted ambi-
tion often the invisible prowlers rose
high in the upper atmospheric strata
for a conference where thought ex-
changes might be made freely from
ship to ship without fear of detection
from below

  as a race the mumes were below
the mental standards of the zoromes
but here and there existed an outstand-
ing exception to the general rule and
these rare exceptions were guarded
against free thought among the
zoromes was carefully restricted near
the surface level and a concentration of
thought conversation from one ship to
the other avoided this however did
not hamper the zoromes from search-
ing the minds of the mumes the latter
possessing no knowledge of the mind-
listening presence to the professor
it seemed much like many people silently
eavesdropping while they abstained
from conversation to hide their own
proximity

  reference was made occasionally on
various sections of mume to the captive
zorome and a burst of hope in the
sentient beating heart of zora opti-
mistically linked this appellation with
her beloved bext u- was of
the opinion that this celebrated captive
might easily be the captured commander
of the zorome cruiser which had been

snatched away so ruthlessly by maraud-
ing mumes the work of investigation
was done they learned that the cap-
tive was on exhibition at ndlet an im-
portant base for the return of incoming
space craft

  it took the two ships but a short
time to locate ndlet surrounded by a
city vast buildings the principal man-
ufacturing plants for space ships
loomed up from below to meet the in-
visible ships of the cosmic void

 bext-fee must be there cried
zora

  she pointed far across the city to an
open spot among the buildings where
tiny shifting dots designated a crowd
of mumes in her heart she truly be-
lieved that bext was where she pointed
and where her heart dictated she must
go there was no swerving of zoras
purpose u- entertained the pos-
sibility of bext being there but he was
not guided by the intuitive instincts
which actuated zora

  the ships sped low over the mingled
crowd of both organic and metal
mumes the latter predominating in
numbers the object of their attention
was a single zorome who looked down
upon them from a raised platform of
massive stone blocks he stood there
taciturn and unmoving in the latter
case because his tentacles were securely
fettered with metal cables which led to
inset staples deep in the stone platform
a metal girdle encircled his waist be-
cause his face was bruised and scarred
and because there were grooved un-
familiar lines of suffering professor
jameson did not instantly recognize him
but not so with zora

  bext

  in her mental cry was crowded a
world of anguish pity and love in-
stinctively she pressed herself against
the side of the ship nearest bext her
eyes dose to a transparent port the

haggard face was seen to undergo a
transformation like the surface of a
planet suddenly sun-kissed by the un-
expected break in an ominous black
cloud so it seemed to the machine
men watching from above

 zora it cant be i youre not
here the tired face grew sombre
once more a wan smile flitting sug-
gestively derisively across the worn
features as if sudden realization had
dispersed a mirage the delirium
i am losing my grip

  i am really here bext you are
unable to see me

  oth hope and bewilderment
u mingled in the expression on
bexts face he became lost to the
chaos of lesser thought impressions
hurled at him by the spectators below
they were jibing him this sentient
symbol of what zor and its retinue of
worlds was soon to become they told
him that the beauty of zor would be
overrun with the mumes the mumes
would conquer then extend their empire
over neighboring systems adjacent to
both zor and mumed zoromes would
be helpless beneath the heel of d and
his empire builders even as bext him-
self was this upstart who had come
to mumed and dared to retaliate for
their raid on ipmats and return to zor
to boast of his act

  bext remained oblivious to all this
however sweetly oblivious to the dull
pain of his hard unyielding fetters and
the cruel biting girdle over which his
cramped body sagged once more his
mind swam in symphonious harmony
with the consciousness of zora that
entrancing nerve-dulling mental phan-
tasma which professor jameson had
often felt guilty in disturbing or pene-
trating with his own matter of fact
thoughts whenever he had found him-
self in company with the two
zora of the zoromes



 the mental communion of zora and
bext had somehow provoked misin-
terpreted attention from several of the
more mentally acute mumes for several
of them were now centering their jibes
on bexts disordered state of mind be-
lieving that he was weakening that he
was losing his mentality foolishly talk-
ing to friends of his who were not
there as bext had originally suspected
on hearing zoras exclamation they be-
lieved that he had broken down com-
pletely his brain suffering from mental
delusions

  careful princess  u- remon-
strated kindly do not give up our
secret or else it may prove even more
difficult than it now looks for the re-
lease of bext there are those down
there among the mumes who are nearly
on an equal with us in reading thoughts
the concentration between you and
bext was unusually heavy

 oh get him get him away from
that place and let us fly from here

 zora had been the most anxious of
any to come cloaking her terror be-
neath the clinging resolve to find bext
at any cost now she was increasingly
anxious to snatch bext and be gone
terrified lest an ill-omened fate or cir-
cumstance might suddenly disrupt the
plot to rescue him

  a slight acknowledgement of presence
made them aware that the ship of j-
 was close behind also watching
the scene beneath them it was up to
ij- and j- to take the
initiative and it was the former who
made the suggestion

ctand by overhead j- and
 we shall land just outside the
crowd their attention is on bext i
shall let my machine men out one by
one and they will mingle in the crowd
only a few of us including the organic
zoromes will remain in the ship

twelve of the machine men from my
ship will enter the crowd and edge
close to the platform from different
directions at the command of m-
m who will be first to jump upon
the platform and burn away bexts
cables with his heat ray the others will
cover his act and hold back the mumes
when bext is released they will watch
closely for the door of the ship to open
in order that they may know where the
ship is and fight their way to it

 and what shall i do asked
j-

  stand ready to lend whatever as-
sistance you deem advisable in any way
especially in case of emergency this
is left to your judgment for up above
you will probably see the situation bet-
ter we must act quickly after
 mm gives the word because of
the sudden surprise our minority will
possess the advantages should escape
be delayed by reinforcements of the
mumes it is up to those in the waiting
space-ships to hold them off

  the ship of j- hung high over
the assemblage of mumes while the
other ship settled silently and cautiously
near the fringe of the crowd it was
the plan of u- to keep his ship
moving beyond the edge of the crowd
letting a machine man out at intervals
so that a sudden cluster of them would
not attract undue attention also if
the ship remained too long in one
spot a hurrying mume might discover
its invisible compactness quite abruptly
stealth and secrecy were of vital
importance

  as the ship settled low the oval door
opened quickly and x- stepped out
pushing the door shut behind him all
in the space of a second the act had
passed unseen and the machine man
of zor melted into the crowd surround-
ing the stone platform on which stood
the fettered bext x-q was accepted


amazing stories

by a disinterested populace as just
another mechanical mume the ship
passed on a short distance rising
quickly to be clear of a running group
or organic mumes scuttling towards the
crowd on their jointed spidery legs

  as the ship descended the doorway
magically reappeared and another
zorome dropped close to the gathering
whose attention was concentrated upon
the spectacle of the wretched bext
the doorway was near to the ground
and r- was careful to bring it
close to the backs of organic mumes
for wisely enough u- feared that
one of the endless row of eyes in the
conical heads of metal might sight the
fleeting apparition of a space ship door-
way where there was no space ship
visible

  w- dropped out melting into the
packed assemblage the door swinging
noiselessly shut behind him then
further on it was the professors turn
the furtive act was consummated suc-
cessfully and he pushed his way among
the mumes there was only one in all
that throng who saw the door of the
invisible ship open from time to time
and he was the center of attraction the
captive bext a soft mental utterance
from u- had given him to under-
stand what was soon to happen

  having encircled the crowd nearly
twice the ship rose slighdy to be above
the heads of those below while twelve
machine men slowly made their way to
the front on all sides of the platform
from appearance they were no differ-
ent from the metal mumes and guard-
edly they controlled their mental radia-
tions to conceal their identity an act
which the - mumes would have been un-
able to reverse

professor jameson knew that a
word from him would bring
twelve machine men leaping upon the

platform beside bext he waited
unable to see across to the other side
of the platform waiting patiently until
he believed that those who had left
the ship last of all had gained con-
venient positions with the exception
of himself none of the zoromes who
had emerged from the ship were armed
in any way the fore-tentacle of profes-
sor jamesons metal body possessed a
devastating heat ray near its termina-
tion and it was this heat ray the pro-
fessor expected to employ in rapidly
burning way the cables which held bext
to the stone platform

  few of the mumes were armed how-
ever and this minority carried the
metal-eaters hooked conveniently at
their sides the machine men of zor
felt that had they entered the crowd
with weapons too much attention would
have been drawn to them they would
have been discovered almost immedi-
ately their defense lay in the two
waiting ships which drifted aboe them

  the professor felt the fateful moment
was at hand a mental exclamation
vibrated soundlessly from his brain
as a quick spring brought him hurtling
upon the platform he was at the side
of bext before the amazed mumes
could realize what had happened and
even then they thought it the act of
a purposeful mume bent on perpetrat-
ing some new indignity upon the help-
less captive but a bright glow from
the tentacle of this machine man caused
a wave of doubt alarm and consterna-
tion to sweep through the crowd the
professor disregarded the excited inter-
rogations which were flung at him as
the intense heat of his ray parted a
metal cable

  machine men leaped upon the plat-
form beside him but not to frustrate
his act as many of the more sluggish
thinking mumes supposed they
formed a formidable metal wall about
zora of the zoromes



the professor and the organic zorome
whose bonds were already half removed
from him professor jameson had no
time to remove the metal girdle or the
metal rings encircling bexfs tentacles
in fact if the professor had possessed
a plentiful supply of time he could not
have removed them without seriously
burning bext ragged stumps of
cables dangled from his six tentacles
the professor now devoted his atten-
tion to the thicker cables whicte held
the self-locked girdle

  unrest filtered through the crowd
and they surged for the platform the
metal men of mume clambering up to
investigate this sudden act which had
occurred unheralded surprised yet
unsuspecting they were caught up in
metal tentacles and hurled backward
into the surging masses of machine
men and organic mumes metal feet
from above pushed away clinging ten-
tacles seeking leverage upon the lip of
the platform

  a frantic cry from the mind of a
more astute mume instantly ended the
disordered investigation of what was
taking place on the platform and
brought forth a deadly menace to the
twelve machine men surrounding bext

  zoromes

several of the metal mumes
dragged at the feet of t- pull-
ing him down into the throng the
comer of the platform on which t-
had been standing lay unguarded and
open to several machine men of mu-
med who were shoved up by their
companions

  frantically the professor played his
ray upon the last thick cable holding
the metal girdle of bext aware of the
conflict that was descending like an
avalanche upon his comrades of zor
w- seizing the metal cable snapped
it short before the heat ray had eaten

more than half way through zq
once known as jbf among the tripeds
felt a paralyzing sensation grip one of
his metal limbs he looked down just
in time to see it dangle useless from his
metal body then fall away from him
several corroding spots were growing
larger on one side of his cubed body
he glanced out over the crowd and saw
ejectors of the mumes levelled at him
and his companions

  a blinding flash blotted out this vi-
sion originating apparently from no-
where a wreckage of machine men
and torn mumes lay scattered beyond
one end of the stone platform a dev-
estating blast had issued from the in-
visible ship of j-

  bext was now free and guarded by
professor jameson and w- the
professor glanced quickly around in
search of the oval doorway which would
reveal the presence of the invisible space
ship he could not find it n-
leaped headlong into the jumbled fray
below them where t- was beset by
several mechanical mumes who had
pulled him down and were attempting
to pull off his all important yet inde-
pendently helpless head z- join-
ed him more mumes were mounting
the platform a tentacle encircled
w- and pulled him backward

  mm

  the cry rang frantic above the chaos
of thoughts and mental ejaculations of
strife burning into the professors con-
sciousness he turned to find a me-
chanical mume squeezing the life from
the gasping bext it was zora from
the invisible space ship who had quick-
wittedly brought his attention to the
peril besetting bext

  professor jameson raised his heat
ray full upon the pointed head of the
mume and saw him release bext and
go plunging madly into the maelstrom
of fighting forces below his tentacles


amazing stories

flailing frantically at both friends and
foes in his indiscriminating haste to
escape the blazing horror released so
suddenly into his metal optics- w-
battled desperately with two of the
mumes the professor applied the heat
ray to his two assailants and they
quickly dispersed one of them too late
falling inanimate a hole burnt clear
through his metal head the professor
seized bext and swung him around out
of reach of the climbing hordes of
mumes

  mm-this way come

  again it was zoras electrifying di-
rections which bit into the professors
mind he looked about him bewildered
searching for the oval door of the ship
all he could see on every side were
hurrying rushing throngs of mumes
both mechanical and organic specimens
three brilliant flashes in as many dif-
ferent spots blinded his vision momen-
tarily again one of the unseen ships
had struck leaving three gaping spots
of wreckage and dead bodies in its
wake

a ragged cavity upon the profes-
sors body told him that he was
the target for a mume marksman and
now for the first time he saw several
ragged pits on his metal legs and ten-
tacles the jostling mob was respon-
sible for these unfinished cavities oth-
erwise he might now be helpless

  another series of crackling hissing
bursts of white-hot incandescence
splashed their wake of death into the
excited hordes of mume reinforcements
but near the platform the ships dared
not loose their weapons for machine
men of both worlds grappled madly
tentacle to tentacle meanwhile the in-
visible space-craft kept up their havoc
causing the rushing throngs of mumes
to turn back by the platform the
zoromes were still outnumbered twenty

to one their only advantage lying in the
fact that restriction of space failed to
allow more than a fraction of the mu-
mes at them

  professor jameson suddenly discerned
the doorway of the space ship he
pointed to it excitedly calling the at-
tention of both bext and w-s
even as they looked a half score or
more of machine men poured out from
it each armed with a ray gun sim-
ilar  the built-in affair in the profes-
sors tentacle they were from the ship
of j- immediately after the last
zorome had hurried forth the doorway
disappeared the ship had moved to
avoid any possible destruction its door-
way once more closed a gathering of
mumes were forced flat as the invisible
ship leaped forward soon the bom-
bardment from above was once more
unloosed upon the mumes

  space craft and airships of the mu-
mes were appearing on the scene those
which came close were blasted out of
the sky an airship broke to pieces
strangely leaped sideways and fell to
the ground amid a scattering of mumes
some of whom failed to escape it there
had been a collision with one of the
space ships of zor

  the odds were becoming so over-
whelming on the platform where bext
had beefi recently fettered that the ma-
chine men and organic zoromes were
literally forced off into the assemblage
below a fighting rioting battle of
machine men

  we shall land just beyond where
the crowd is thinnest  the professor
heard u- direct him get to the
ship as quickly as you can

 fought their way in the di-
rection u- had designated ex-

ray of professor jameson cleared the
way more than once the professor
and w- felt the insidious metal-
eating pistols directed their way bext
gave a warning cry as he saw tiny
streams of granular metal drip from
the professors head a nearby sniper
had his gun snatched from him by w-
 who thereupon wielded it himself

  explosions still crackled and hissed
all over the public square of the mu-
mes as the invisible space ships main-
tained a protecting barrage inert ma-
chine men lay quiet victims of either
the heat rays or the metal-eaters or-
ganic mumes lay dead broken and
crushed bits of metal were scattered

the explosions equally significant were

he died fighting

fully a dozen mechanical mu-
mes surged in upon the professor
bext and w- seizing them in
their tentacles the two machine men
fought savagely bext resisted demo-
niacally yet futilely the professors ten-
tacle possessing the heat ray became
cramped between himself and one of
the mumes who had seized him the
weapon of w- was wrested from
him even as he himself had obtained it

  an agonized cry issued from bext
an audible articulation professor jame-
son rarely heard the organic zoromes
ever utter a flutter of mental terror
and maddening anxiety sprang from an
outward source into the professors
mind from whom he well knew
bext was being viciously torn to pieces
before his very eyes the victim of the
avenging mumes madly he tried to
fight his way to the side of bext but
besides the dragging resistance of two
metal mumes more of the enemy

blocked off his passage separating him
from bext before anything could be
done bext was dead the professor
saw him go down trampled and inani-
mate in his own life blood

  zoromes with their rays of death
crowded into the fighting group ali
was confusion the professor felt a
dull pain and he went down to the
ground wondering as he crawled among
the threshing feet if a metal-eater had
found his metal encased brain search-
ingly his tentacles roved over his coni-
cal head it was deeply pitted in sev-
eral spots dangerously close to the
vulnerable brain yet he was conscious
and no mortal damage had been done

  vengefully he tore loose with the
heat ray taking his stand with w-
and several zoromes from js
space ship

  quick-to the ship-there

  w- pointed to an oval doorway
a short distance away but one mume
blocked their passage the professors
heat ray bore down upon him in unison
with several others and eight zoromes
rushed through the oval doorway and
into the space ship of u- a few
stragglers followed

  hurry cried u- rise r-
 we must maintain a constant fire
while the ship of j- descends to
pick up the remaining survivors

  bext is gone w- exclaimed
he died fighting

  i know was u-s sad re-
joinder we saw it from the ship but
could do nothing

professor jameson sought out
zora to console her as best he could
yet on seeing her he hesitated in his
approach her mind immersed in a
manifold sorrow shut out all commu-
nication she stood alone not far from

that many of the zoromes who had re-
cently manned j-s ship were pres-

directed off upon the horizon

  a series of black dots grew steadily
larger in the sky sweeping directly for
the center of the recent combat

  an armada of space ships an-
nounced g- beside a telescope

  u- bent a hasty glance below
where a few lingering zoromes beat a
hasty retreat to an oval opening into
which they disappeared from sight

sary to conceal our position now if
ever our mantle of invisibility will
prove its worth i

  on the square below the oval door
snapped shut behind the last zorome
whose heat ray had splayed a devastat-
ing fire of destruction upon a mume
whose wavering metal-eater had pock-
marked the zoromes metal body there
came a rush of dust behind the spot
where the door had been and those
watching from the ship above realized
that j- had also seen the ap-
proaching armada

  r- shot the ship upward and
sped at right angles to the approach of
the numerous ships which dotted the
sky they were space ships of the
mumes sent hurriedly from a nearby
location to the scene where the invad-
ing zoromes had magically appeared
from their invisible space-ships

  how many of the enemy ships had
penetrated the veil of defensive rays the
mumes did not know but they were
certain however that none would es-

cape several of the vanguard swept
low about the spot of recent combat
flashing their rays horizontally feeling-
ly hoping to strike an invisible enemy
their rays also flared upward into the
empty spaces while aircraft quickly
sought refuge to assist in the search
for the zoromes

  a blast leaped out of nowhere to
crumple and explode one of the space
ships of the mumes hanging low over
the city

  j- is mad to commit such an
act u- exclaimed they will
trace his ship and destroy it

  that ray was shot from our ship
cried r- from the controls

  the mumes are commencing to close
up this way

  c--cease firing u- or-
dered they will find us

  i did not fire replied c-
u- turned in surprise to find
c- standing only a short distance
from him all attention became riveted
in the direction of the artillery room
inside stood zora grim tense and res-
olute her tentacles upon the dials and
levers controlling and directing the de-
structive forces the ship of zor was
capable of unloosing upon its enemies
a movement of her tentacles and
another of the approaching ships was
torn half away this time in off-center
shot the remaining wreckage plunging
to the ground a shattered mass

  zora-stop-it means suicide

  but zora did not hear or if she did
she disregarded the command ven-
geance lurked in her every act dominat-
ing all sense of reasoning enveloping
her in its spiteful cloak lending her the
fury of reckless abandon a blinded in-
difference to the future the present
was all powerful they had killed her

the tortures of the flesh and the indig-

nities of captivity they had perpetrated
upon him bound and defenseless as he
was they were to bear the brunt of
her unleashed wrath

  zora-stop p

the only reply was the complete de-
molishment of a large factory over
which they sped low in order to wheel
from the spot where flitting flickering
gleams of destruction marked their last
position machine men hurried rapidly
in the direction of the artillery room to
prevent zoras madness from further
imperilling them c- in the lead

  blazing eyes turned to greet them
and a heavy metal door crashed down-
ward severing the fore tentacle of c-
 who had reached the threshold like
angry wasps the space ships of the
mumes sped in the wake of the demol-
ished building their rays playing and
crackling through the atmosphere both
outward and upward waving desper-
ately to locate the invisible menace

  only the keen maneuvering of r-
 saved them quickly he swerved
about into the very midst of their ranks
narrowly missing collisions with several
of the enemy ships a raking devasta-
tion unloosed itself on both sides of the
invisible ship and fully six of the mume
space craft were blown to bits the
reckless speed of qr- made accurate
counting impossible so quickly did they
leave the spot where ruins fell from the
sky u- waved his tentacles wildly
as zora unloosed several more shots
ineffective this time yet plainly mark-
ing the course of their retreat

  machine men pounded and hammered
at the thick metal door which only
opened from the inside and which re-
sisted theit efforts

 upward directed u- anx-
iously go high where there will be no
such tempting targets for zoras aim

 the invisible space ship of zor

careened to a vertical ascent which made
the zoromes lean crazily planetward
held only by the artificial gravity of the
ships flooring which a nimble tentacle
of r- had intensified at this ver-
tical maneuver zoras rage uncontrolled
now vented its fury with the long range
equipment aimed at the buildings of
ndlet far below one after another they
burst apart hurling debris and occupants
skyward missed shots left great cav-
ities and fissures in the avenues

  blazing destruction swept dangerously
close from below their existence hung
slenderly on the skilled manipulation of

lurched turned and swung erratically
from one side to the other to escape
the numerous fingers of death which
crept and wavered all over the sky in
search of them and still zora un-
mindful of the frantic entreaties to de-
sist spread her path of revenge ob-
livious to danger secure from interrup-
tion behind the locked door of the ar-
tillery room meanwhile the invisible

of deaths snapping jaws

which hemmed them in prisoners of the
planet mumed r- was enabled to
put on tremendous speed once they were
above the atmosphere and the to-
pography beneath them changed rapidly
as they passed into the opposite hemis-
phere this frustrated further efforts
of zora to vent her retaliation on the
mumes for the loss of her lover

the machine men felt easier safe-
ty however was only temporarily
assured the mumes would come
searching for them in a more determined
manner and no place would be safe for
them the zoromes did not underestim-
ate the cupidity of the mumes the
amazing stories

professor in his previous conversations
with the zoromes had likened these
enemies to veritable frankenstein crea-
tions that had turned upon their mak-
ers zor had become threatened by the
bitter fruits of a kindly intentioned mis-
take

  the armament of the ship was stilled
yet zora would not hold conversation
with them she remained strangely si-
lent and unmanifesting like the danger-
ous weapons over which she presided
vaguely the zoromes sensed a change
in her attitude which had yielded from
blind wrath to heavy sorrow draped
veils of melancholy gloom utter dejec-
tion enveloping her shades of loneli-
ness dulled her mind and her next acts
impetuous impulses or studied deli-
berations remained unconjectured aboard
the ship by both machine men and or-
ganic zoromes only by cutting through
the metal door might they gain access
to the artillery room and u re-
frained from this feeling somehow that
it would not be necessary a close ap-
proach to the surface over a sleeping
city in the darkened half of mumed
testified to the complete passing of
zoras wrath as she apparently de-
sired she was left alone with her sor-
row

  after what seemed a long time to the
organic zoromes zora lifted the door
of the artillery room and emerged
forth wan heart broken and badly in
need of nourishment meanwhile the
space ship cruised stealthily below the
mantle of pale shimmering effulgence
seeking an escape but the hollow sphere
of radiant menace was found impene-
trable several times they narrowly
missed destruction by ships of the
mumes who located them with proxim-
ity detectors and seeing no visible ships
fired in all directions the clinging per-
sistence of the craft whose commander
was recklessly desirous of becoming

famed for the destruction of the in-
visible ship from zor necessitated its
being shot to pieces

  it seemed especially to the organic
zoromes that this endless chase would
never cease detector alarms weie being
placed everywhere and when they
found themselves in what they believed
to be an isolated spot free from pursuit
several black dots would drop from
space into the atmosphere and search for
them with their deadly rays escape
was frequently preceded by a battle
the situation rapidly grew worse as the
mumes became more accustomed to
their invisible maneuvers through the
aid of the proximity detectors and the
search for the invisible ships grew more
grim and systematized

tothing was discovered concern-
  ing the space-ship of j-
whether it was cruising beneath the pro-
tective covering of rays enshrouding
mumed or whether it had made its es-
cape one thing was certain it had not
been brought down by the mumes the
zoromes would soon have learned of it
in their elusive travelling about the
planet

  eventually the food supply for the
organic zoromes became exhausted a
raid on a storehouse in an isolated city
of mumed was made the provender
of the mumes sustained the zoromes
though it proved flat and distasteful to
their own peculiar appetites

  it was professor jameson who sug-
gested a means of escape this came
about shortly after an unsuccessful at-
tempt had been made to run a safety
lane into space with several ships of the
mumes the watchful enemy had de-
tected the invisible ship and almost in-
stantly the ships of mumed had dropped
planetward while the pulsating rays of
death rapidly closed once again nearly
catching the invisible ship from zor
zora of the zoromes



the inevitable chase had followed before
the zoromes could confuse and elude
their followers

 we must capture a ship of the
mumes abandon our own and in this
way escape to free space said the pro-
fessor

  it is a desperate chance-giving up
our one protection invisibility u-
considered

  but our only chance the professor
countered sooner or later a wild ran-
dom shot of theirs will strike true and
then it will be all over for us

  the idea was agreed upon they flew
as near to a space ship terminal as they
dared but here again a proximity detec-
tor once more revealed them and they
were forced to flee the professor had
based his chances on their escape under
the fundamental theory that the most
obvious features are those which are
overlooked yet it appeared that it would
indeed be difficult to put this theory into
practice several more days the invisible
ship of zor circled the globe beneath
the blanket of unpassable rays zoromes
remained constantly at the short range
telescopes and finally that for which
they searched was found

  a spaceship untended and apparently
unused for some time was found near
the outskirts of a city where the ma-
chine men were sure there were no de-
tectors for they lingered in the vicinity
to make sure of no subsequent attack
which always followed their discovery
by a detector evidently the mumes
had not adequately covered every sec-
tion of the globe as u- had sus-
pected might be the case

    the craft from zor descended close
to the solitary ship hovering just above
the ground while n- was let out to
investigate the interior he reported
the ship space-worthy and two more of
the machine men were sent to take
control of it close beside the invisible

ship it rose high above the atmosphere

of mumed where both machine men and
organic zoromes transferred themselves
the latter space-suited the invisible
ship was stripped of all essentials and
towed behind the stolen craft accord-
ing to further details in the professors
plans they headed for one of the prin-
cipal safety lanes which were so well
guarded

  from a distance they waited until a
concourse of space-ships were about to
leave mumed the invisible space-ship
was sent drifting by a well directed push
of the stolen craft directly for the open-
ing of the safety lane into which the
ships of the mumes were heading as
the zoromes expected its invisible pres-
ence was immediately picked up by the
mumes several waving rays darted
here and there nervously

  an exploding mass of metal material-
  ized suddenly out of the air and
the watching zoromes saw the space
ship which had so long protected them
and befooled the mumes blown to bits
the triumphant mumes had apparently
culminated their long search and no
longer would a tight watch be kept on
the safety lanes to prevent the escape
of this marauding ship from zor which
had cost mumed heavily in ships prop-
erty and lives

  the safety lane opened wide to al-
low the passage of the ships in one
of them the zoromes passed safely
from the danger ridden vicinity of
mumed and into the depths of the cos-
mic void once free of the deadly cov-
ering of rays they lagged behind the
others in their stolen ship then at a
safe distance they spurted suddenly out
of the planetary system and into the
seas of space bound for zor

  on the trip back to zor the sorrow
of zora became less acute though she
felt that life held little for her now that


amazing stories

she had lost her beloved bext profes-
sor jameson with his irrefutable logic
consoled her as best as he could paint-
ing an inspiring future for her and
pointing out that it was her duty to zor
to carry-on in the face of her heart-
crushing loss especially during this crisis
brought about by the mumes

  as is ever the way with universal law
which knows but a small percentage of
exceptions zoras wrecked dreams be-
came remodelled to fit the circumstances
and environment arisen through the
death of bext the destruction she had
caused upon mumed gave her an idea
she resolved to carry on in the capacity
bext had known no longer would
she stay upon zor in comfort idleness
and luxury she was to take an active
part in the coming campaign against the
mumes

  on approaching ipmats u- was
careful to avoid any cruisers of zor for
the sight of an enemy ship would cause
it to become a ready target for zorome
marksmanship oose to the frigid
storm-tossed surface of ipmats radia-
tions sent out by the thought amplifiers
brought a protecting escort of ships to
meet the returned travelers on the
surface of ipmats lit with a feeble sun-
light they learned that j- had re-
turned long before and had stopped only
a short time upon ipmats before con-
tinuing to zor j- had seemed
anxious to reach the laboratories of zor
for some urgent reason or other

  it was a pock-marked crew of ma-
chine men several lacking a metal leg
or tentacle their bodies horribly pocked
and scarred where the destructive weap-
ons of the mumes had found their
mark that saw the geometical surface
of zor loom large they came sur-
rounded by the escort from ipmats at
first the terrestrial zoromes believed
that their forces had returned with a
captive ship but report travelled before

the actual landing of the ships and it
was learned that the crew of u-

had returned and that princess zora was
safe

  j- was first among those to
greet u- and the returned - zor-
omes whom he feared had been lost
following the tentacle to tentacle com-
bat on mumed he had lost track of
u-rs ship when r- had
found it necessary to put on tremendous
speed in escaping the wrath of the
mumes at zoras vengeful sniping
j- had escaped past several incom-
ing space-ships through a safety lane
while confusion reigned among the
mumes following the discovery that an
invisible ship of zor spread death and
destruction in their midst a rapid
check-up between the two commanders
found that seven machine men had been
lost out of the two crews four of them
from the expedition of u- those
of the professors comrades who had
accompanied him on many an adventure
and who had gone to meet death were
r- z- t- and b-
none of the organic zoromes had been
among the casualties however due to
the fact that they had been confined to
the space ships during the attempt to
rescue bext

  bext died like a hero was the pro-
fessors epitaph he fought to the
last

  bext is not dead was j-s
quiet yet startling announcement

c very machine man gave a start of
mental alarm so completely sur-
prised were they by j-ls contradic-
tory assertion zora stood as if turned
to stone her eyes staring wide her heart
beats temporarily arrested

  not dead

  we saw him die-literally slashed to
pieces by the infuriated mumes ex-
claimed u-
zora of the zoromes



  you are right about that said j-
 bext did die but so did m-
m once so i am told there is
bext

  j- pointed to a machine man
of glistening metal parts new from the
factories who now approached the
group how strangely he contrasted
with the corroded chemical eaten bodies
of the zoromes returned from mumed
who were so badly in need of repair and
replacement while the machine men
and organic zoromes stared in surprise
and fascination at the new entrant to
the metal ranks j- rendered a
brief explanation

  when my ship descended to pick up
the remaining zoromes h- one of
those who came with u- noticed
the dead body of bext it was torn and
crushed yet the head half severed from
the neck was intact it is to h-
that bext owes his present existence he
brought the head to the space-ship and
profiting from the experience of m-
m we kept it in a stellar vacuum
compartment until we reached the lab-
oratories here on zor bexts brain was
removed from his organic head and
stimulated to life once more he is now
known among the machine men as w-


  bext cried zora at last collecting
some order out of her chaotic thoughts
at this amazing turn of unexpected
events is it really you

  yes zora

  in that answering affirmation profes-
sor jameson detected the great change
in bexts attitude for zora sympathy
comradeship and interest were manifest
yet that electrifying nerve-startling pas-
sion was strangely absent there was
no quivering eagerness for the ecstatic
communion of minds which bext had
once sought in the presence of zora
the change in bext was sharply con-
trasted by her own attitude which went

out to bext searchingly in the same old
way yet on finding no hold wavered
uncertainly

  zora it is good to see you back
was bexts friendly greeting we
feared for your safety and all those
aboard the ship of u- when you
did not return

  that we did not return soon is my
fault largely was zoras dispirited re-
ply as she stared bewilderingly at the
metal form of bext realizing with a
choking sensation that with the death of
bext had died the tender passion he had
borne for her

  recalled to life bext had lost the
natural impulses and instincts an organic
body had given him he wtas beyond
the laws of scheming plotting nature
and now he was under the synthetic con-
ditions of a machine man somehow
zora came to realize through the wise
counsel dropped her by the professor
that she could never love w- he
was not bext as she had known bext

  the machine man his mental attitude
reborn in the laboratories of zor looked
back upon his passionate regard for
zora much as do older folks look back
upon memories of their childhood which
they are unable to recapture tangibly
or cause to live once more because
of their physical and mental change
through the passing of years bext ac-
cepted the change with an indifferent
fatalism had he anticipated it before
his death he would have wildly deplored
such a seemingly impossible situation
of losing his love for zora but that
would have been like bext not like
w-

  in a bewildered state of mind zora
retired to her palace and was not seen
very often after that single meeting with
bext she was tortured mentally by the
loss of her love memory of which re-
curred constantly now that bext was a
machine man sometimes she selfishly


amazing stories

wished that he had remained dead lov-
ing her as he had done to the last of
his breath yet calm consideration
brought to her attention that this was a
jealous wish and thus she remained in
torment chained to a passion she could
not forget

  meanwhile professor jameson and
the machine men who had taken the
dangerous journey to mumed had their
battle-scarred bodies repaired where
tentacles were entirely gone or ir-
reparable new ones were installed it
was the same case with the metal legs
ragged cavities in the metal of their
bodies were filled and their whole mech-
anism given a new finish once more
they found themselves entire	f

  the trip across space to the system
of mumed had not been in vain much
had been learned already it was re-
ported that the zoromes in the labor-
atories had manufactured a substance
which applied to the space ships caused
them to convert the destructive rays of
the mumes into force rays which hurled
the ships of zor to one side but did not
damage them

  how will this give us a passage
through their protective covering about
mumed  w- argued there is
much yet to be done before we accept
their open invitation to carry the fight
to our system

  it will be a battle of wits said the
professor

  the metal-eaters of the mumes re-
mained only a brief triumph of inventive
skill on their part careful analysis by
the zoromes of several cavities made by
the pistols on their metal bodies showed
that the menace could be easily counter-
acted and made harmless by installation
of a neutralizer in the metal bodies of
the zoromes

  one day while professor jameson sat
in conference with u- w-
j-i and others a machine man en-

tered upon their presence something
about the machine mans new glistening
body and mental stance instantly put
the professor in mind of bext yet it
was not bext

  zora you

 - the machine man cor-
rected will you not offer me con-
gratulations 

  but zora you were still young and
a long life of a character we machine
men do not know lay before you

  i know it now was the quiet reply
yet i never would have come to realize
it i was too deep in the grips of that
passion called love mm that ir-
resistible impulse of natures fashioning
of which you spoke so calmly recall-
ing my agony of mind and desolate feel-
ings i am not sorry that i sought this
means of escape now looking back it
all seems utterly foolish even as it
must have seemed to bext after his
brain transposition but it all depends
upon what attitude you take

  have yon seen bext yet since your
change to a machine man the profes-
sor inquired curiously

  yes he will be sorry that i had
willfully given up my organic life
to become a metal zorome he thought
it deplorable in his practical manner
and i agreed with him yet i am not too
far removed from my organic existence
to lose track of my former attitude en-
tirely and i know that life would have
held little for me as princess zora love
is bitterly cruel even as it is inspiring
and beautiful

  and now what are you intending to
do queried u- now that you
are one of us

  zoras ready reply provoked fresh
memories in the minds of the machine
men present

  i am an artilleryman on a ship un-
der the command of w- in the
coming space war

we are very glad to present a story by ed earl repp to our readers one
who has long been a favorite with our clientele you will find in this
story his old touch and distinctive treatment with which he has pleased
so many readers it is a story in which a wonderful surgeon treating a
human being in a sense as a guinea-pig operates on the brain trying to get

mens sana in corpore sano

ghostly and weird was the
room in which dr lape sat
staring fixedly into the dead
soot-blackened fireplace

          though the world outside
was bright and cheery under the warm
spell of a new england spring day the
room comprising both laboratory and
study for the scientist was a place of
spectral shadows cast upon the colorless
gray walls by subdued lamps placed
carefully in the corners so as not to shed
too much light upon his great test tubes
several of which were much taller than
the man himself

  at a glance over the place one would
have suspected that dr lape either
did not care particularly for sunlight
or that too much natural illumination
had undesired effect upon his various
experimental subjects confined in the
huge tubes in either event the light-
ing in the room was hideous giving it
the uninviting aspect of a sorcerers
den

  dr lape himself was scarcely less re-
pulsive to look at than the distorted
shadows upon his laboratory walls he
seemed to fit in with them perfectly
he was a man of indeterminate age as
often with natural-born hunch-backs it
would have been difficult to guess just
how old he actually was he might have

been forty or even fifty certainly he
looked no older now than the day dot
faversham graduate nurse went to
work for him and she had been his
only assistant for nearly six years now

  as is frequently the case with natures
human freaks what dr lape lacked in
the way of physical charm was more
than made up by his super-mentality for
things scientific and until recently he
had devoted that super-mentality to the
correction at birth of such physical mis-
haps as himself just how far he had
progressed in that direction could have
been readily observed in the cold facts
contained in his many volumes of books
on the subject

  mentally dr merton lape was a
genius physically well dot faversham
had learned to overlook his twisted spine
sallow colorless face and duck-like wad-
dle in favor of his genius and his philan-
thropic endeavors at first she had
been in a state of constant horror in his
presence this she had overcome when
she realized that in the final analysis he
was a great man who was contributing
invaluable facts to mankind she had
even as time passed become indifferent
to the piercing qualities of his sunken
wide-set eyes that glittered in their
sockets like chips of blue-glacial ice his
great head and its sharp features no

longer annoyed her nor did his bony
skeleton-like fingers and rasping voice
cause her to flinch in revolt as they had
at first

  her indifference to all these things
might have been attributed to the fact
that he paid her an excellent salary even
for a graduate nurse but that was not
the case with dot faversham she was
in sympathy with his great work and
was more or less of a philanthropist
herself

  dr lape never appeared in public
sensitive to his deformities he shunned
public gaze like a recluse this could
have been attributed directly to his early
life as a child when he had been the butt
of scorn and ridicule from his play-
mates after the briefest college educa-
tion a student had ever received with
high graduation honors at bloomfield he
had retired to his family home which
stood in a great pile of stone and con-
crete at the very end of a lonely street
there he had begun his lifes work and
his townsmen seldom saw him

  he went about his work with a cool
indifference that immediately character-
ized him for just what he was a cold
undemonstrative man to dot faver-
sham the only bit of sunshine about the
big stone mansion he seemed a man en-
tirely without emotion he seldom
smiled at least not in recent months
and of late he appeared to have become
even more cheerless and undemonstra-
tive if such a thing were possible he
was just stone-cold in all things or
so he seemed

  but dot faversham just twenty-
three now with hair as golden as a new
england sunset had no way of penetrat-
ing his sallow inscrutable mask to see
what kind of a fire burned there had
she been able to do that she would in
all likelihood have deserted the place and
never returned

  until one gloomy blustery day dur-

ing the winter just past she hadnt sus-
pected that beneath his twisted chest
beat a human heart at all he seemed
so unearthly frigid but out of clear sky
that day as if he wrere dealing with
some cold professional problem he had
asked her to marry him there had
been no preliminaries nor did he even
profess love for her he simply asked
her in his sharp rasping voice to become
his wife it was her first hint that he
even regarded her as more than he might
consider a scalpel or a pair of tweezers

  needless to say that she was com-
pletely startled and shocked at first then
frightened she looked at him to see if
he were serious he was as in all
things but he made no attempt to
touch her he just stood at his labor-
atory bench and feasted his sunken eyes
upon her she felt them piercing to the
depths of her soul

  by sheer force of will she overcame
her fear pity took its place he sensed
it instantly even before she spoke and
she saw the corners of his thin mouth
grow firm a strange light sprang into
his eyes he might suddenly have gone
mad

  oh dr lape she had breathed
you should not have asked that it is
so impossible-

  impossible because i am a freak
miss faversham he had interjected
with his true professional indifference
he might have read her mind

  that is an unfair question to ask
she replied readily you are a very
brilliant man dr lape and if i loved
you nothing else would matter but i
do not love you you have never hinted
that you even regarded me in that light
it could never be anyway for i am al-
ready engaged to another man we ex-
pect to be married in june

  engaged miss faversham lape
had not so much as raised an eyebrow in
either amusement or surprise he simply


amazing stories

stared at her fixedly how interesting
and who may i ask is the fortunate
benedict 

  of course you have a right to ask
she managed to smile sympathetically
possibly you have heard of him he
conducts the strong physical culture in
stitute in the city his name is herbert
strong

  herbert strong lape rasped ah
yes miss faversham i have seen his
pictures in the health magazines he is
indeed a man of powerful physique he
is very fortunte-fortunate in two ways
miss faversham in that he is superbly
perfect physically and is to have such a
charming girl as yourself for his bride
what would i not give to possess such
a marvelous body and such a rare flower
for a bride

  oh im sorry dr lape dot had
breathed you should not have brought
up the question i had not intended to
tell you of our plans until the last

minute-

  and left me in the lurch for an as-
sistant miss faversham

  i would have given you ample time
to obtain another nurse she had told
him perhaps now you will want to

get her immediately-

  i could not get along without you
miss faversham he interrupted her to
say a habit she had never liked in him
it bordered on mental-telepathy smack-
ing strangely of the supernatural i
have no thought of making a change on
my own initiative you will remain on
duty of course until your wedding
day 

  as you wish dr lape she had re-
plied relieved but only on condition that
any suggestion of marriage between us
is never to be brought up again i may
find it hard to remain under any other
conditions

  my word on it miss faversham as
he spoke she thought she saw the lips

tremble ever so slightly it never shall
-between us it was stupid of me to
even dare hope that any girl might con-
sider marrying a man so horrible to look
upon as myself he paused to shrug
his misshapen shoulders hopelessly oh
well he added there may be a way out
for such a hopeless case

  she had studied him curiously for a
moment wondering just what he meant
was he considering suicide to relieve
himself of the monotony of living alone
hardly that dr lape was too well
fused with his work to even think of
such a thing yet the way he expressed
himself continued to worry her for
weeks thereafter she had expected al-
most any morning to report at the big
mansion for work and find him the vic-
tim of his own hand instead she found
him laboring harder than ever

  during the ensuing months he had
never broached the subject again he
kept his word as he might a solemn
oath as far as she could tell he might
have forgotten the whole thing but
she did not know what thoughts lay
behind his lackadaisical visage nor did
she know that his love for her had be-
come a form of madness to possess her
at any cost she was aware however
that a great change had come over him
since the day she had spumed him he
went about his tasks like a man living
in another world never smiling seldom
speaking his eyes seemed more shrunken
than before and there were dark patches
beneath them suggesting irregular rest
and lack of sleep

  she guessed that he was working at
night on some private experiment but
in her routine work of caring for the
living experimental subjects confined in
the big test tubes in the laboratory she
saw no material evidence of it she
might have long since resigned her po-
sition-and she secretly wanted to--yet
remained on the job for the single rea-

son that a bride needs many new things
for her wedding her parents could not
supply them for her and the portion of
her pay check not needed at home went
for the filmy things a prospective bride
loves to purchase

  spring had come at last dot as her
fiance herb liked to call her worked
happily in the thought that june and its
significance was near at hand in keen
anticipation of the coming event herb
called for her each evening at the big
mansion and drove her home driving
slowly through quiet lanes of tall pop-
lars that were showing signs of life
once more

  as expected of a physical culture in-
structor herb strong was a powerful
muscular man with clean-cut features to
match his marvelous physique young
bubbling over with enthusiasm he was
ruddy-faced and the envy of many a
youth and man less endowed with that
kind of human body that inspires quick
admiration his hair was as dark as
his eyes and as unruly as he was boyish
he was in the neighborhood of twenty-
nine or thirty and had made quite a
name for himself in college football a
dislocated shoulder had taken him to the
hospital where dot was serving her time
at training there they had met they
were well-matched folks said

  they made many plans for the future
during their slow rides in the evenings
and he spoke of a buyer for his school
he expressed a desire to sell out and go
to new york to establish a gymnasium
for rich business men and engage in
correspondence-teaching as a side line
she was thrilled at the prospect

  but never once did she mention to
him dr lapes cold unexpected pro-
posal to her herb strong was in-
clined to be quick-tempered and being
in love he might not understand she
kept the incident secret in fact she had

almost forgotten it in planning for the
future

  but dr merton lape had far from
forgotten that he wanted dot faver-
sham among other things more than
anything else in life had she been
able to watch over his nightly experi-
ments in a small laboratory in another
room of the mansion she might have
understood that he meant to possess
many things including herself she did
not know that for months now he had
been secretly experimenting with the
transmutation of matter for many
years dr lape had worked theoretically
on what might have been called fifth
dimension surgery in connection with
transmutation had she been able to
visit that secret laboratory in an upper
wing of the house she would have seen
that during recent months he had de-
voted his cunning super-mentality to
successfully materializing what once were
theories

  one look at his experimental subjects
confined in cages in that hidden lab-
oratory would have convinced anyone
that dr lape had achieved the impos-
sible only his mad love for dot fav-
ersham had caused him to take secret
pride in his accomplishments along this
particular line of endeavor and what
an accomplishment it smacked of
lycanthropy

  in those cages in the upper lab-
oratory crouched strange beasts there
were cats that growled and barked like
dogs there were dogs that spat with
all the vemon of an enraged feline and
too there were monkeys that had suc-
cessfully survived his weird fifth di-
mension surgery tests in which the
brain of one had been transplanted into
the skull of the other and vice versa
yes dr merton lape would do any-
thing to possess dot faversham and
also-the superbly perfect physique of
herbert strong but in gaining posses-


amazing stories

sion of strongs perfect body he must
first remove the others brain and re-
place it with his own even as he had
transplanted the brains of the cats into
the skulls of his canine subjects

  dr merton lape cunningly and sci-
entifically had it all worked out ac-
cording to hoyle his plan was perfect
there could be no mistake dot faver-
sham was to be his bride unknowingly
and with his brain safely tucked away in
the great skull of herbert strong he
could enjoy her to the utmost and in
the process he would come into posses-
sion of a superbly perfect body but
what of his own twisted misshapen
form

  as he sat staring fixedly into the
dead soot-blackened fireplace waiting
for dot faversham to report for the
days work he silently evolved a plan
for the disposal of his own ugly body
his cunning scheme briefly enough was
just this

  in his fifth dimension surgery the
two brains his own and that of herbert
strong would be transplanted from one
skull to the other simultaneously leav-
ing no scars and shedding no blood
thereafter he would have no use for
the ugly thing that now contained his
organs nor would he have use for the
brain of herbert strong after the
operation the body of dr merton lape
and the brain of herbert strong would
simply die and it would look like a nat-
ural death while herbert strong with
dr merton lapes super-brain in his
skull would live and enjoy life at its
best as for continuing to possess his
own worldly possessions all he had to do
was to make a will in which in event
of his dr lapes death everything was
to go to dot faversham and her hus-
band herbert strong that would give
him possession of the big mansion and
all that it contained even after the
death of his own body as far as con-

tinuing with his scientific work was

concerned-well with herbert strongs
body he could mingle with his fellow
men and enjoy himself he had ample
funds and his work along the material
lines was practically finished his books
and their invaluable contributions to
science proved that

  as far as herbert strongs private
affairs were concerned they too could
easily be disposed of in a way free of
suspicion coming into the fortune of
dr lape herbert strong would be
most likely to sell or abandon his physi-
cal culture practice and enjoy himself
with leisure he would not with a for-
tune in the bank be expected to con-
tinue toiling over the rolls of human fat
that waddled to his school for reduction
the whole thing was as simple as rolling
off a log

  a little mis-adjustment of the fifth
dimensional surgical apparatus where it
connected with the nerve centers of his
dr lapes skull would forever pre-
vent the brain of herbert strong from
talking through alien lips but that
mis-adjustment would in no way inter-
fere with the successful transmutation
of his brain into herbert strongs brain-
cup it would simply destroy the others
brain and his own body and it would
appear that death had come over dr
lape quite naturally and he had heart
trouble anyway but he had no near
relatives who might contest his will or
demand an investigation into his death
for that he was thankful for he did not
wish to tie up his fortune in litigation
he wanted to spend some of it on a
honeymoon to europe with dot faver-
sham he wanted to enjoy it with his
stolen body

  now he said silently to himself
staring into the fireplace all fve got
to do is to get herbert strong here
that should be very easy-a quiet sup-
per for the bride and her intended
the body pirate



groom and presto on the other hand
it might be best not to have dorothy--
miss faversham in the house per-
haps i had better make other arrange-
ments yes that would be best she
might get curious during the transmuta-
tion and spoil it all but the supper-
hi have it just the same and will in-
vite strong to come here the next day
under the pretense of working on my
old body thats the plan i will let
miss faversham have that day off to
shop i think a pre-wedding present of
say a hundred dollars ought to keep her
away from here then when she comes
back to work shell simply find my old
body while i as herbert strong will be
at my school waiting developments

 he might have settled back and
laughed with satisfaction at his own
cunning but dr lape was too tired
fagged out from his nights of painstak-
ing labors to laugh it was not in his
nature to be gay even with himself
what he did do however was to snatch
up a health magazine that lay in a
rack attached to his chair and thumb
coolly through the pages until he came
to a picture of herbert strong printed
on one of them then a gloating look
sprang into his sunken eyes the pic-
ture of a strong masculine body had
always fascinated him and how he had
longed to have such a body as his very
own now thanks to his own genius
it was within the realms of possibility
more than that it was about to ma-
terialize into more than longing

  as he sat staring at the picture of
strong who was posed like atlas with
the world on his broad shoulders it was
easy to see that dr merton lape con-
templated something untoward his face
was no inscrutable mask now his sunk-
en eyes gleamed murder and he would
murder to possess a body like that of
herbert strong and a girl like dot
faversham for his bride strangely

enough he never paused to consider

what crime he might commit in stealing
the body of herbert strong in tak-
ing his own life as he planned to take
it there seemed no crime if there was
who could prove that a crime had been
committed 

   until he heard dot spring the latch on
the front door he sat gloating silently
over the picture hearing her he quietly
laid the magazine aside and stepped to
one of his big test tubes there she
found him studying the contents of the
tube

  with a cheery good morning dr
lape she deposited her wraps in a lab-
oratory closet flung back a vagrant red
curl with a deft touch and stepped
lightly to his side already garbed in
the solid white of her profession she
was ready for work and much to her
astonishment she received a broad
cheery smile from her employer it was
the first time he had smiled in let her
see now-two months but dr lape
could afford to smile at his best now
isnt a mans intended bride entitled to
a smile from him occasionally

  good morning miss faversham he
rasped cheerily i have been waiting
for you there is much to be done to-
day and the work must fall upon you
i have been troubled with insomnia lately
and i am very tired i will outline your
duties and retire

  you look very fatigued dr lape
she smiled back sympathetically you
have been working too hard i am glad
to see that you have not resorted to
opiates as often happens with worn-out
physicians i shall follow any instruc-
tions you give me for the day

  good miss faversham he said
running his practiced eyes over the sub-
ject in the tube that subject would
have filled a layman or laywoman with
quick horror for it was in their en-
tirety the internal organs of a human

being living breathing and feeding with
the same regularity as any confined in a
normal body but dot faversham was
accustomed to such things since com-
ing into dr lapes employ i have
complete confidence in you lape con-
tinued you have constantly proven
your ability to handle any situation
that arises among my experimental sub-
jects this time however it will re-
quire your utmost skill to keep alive
subject number  in this tube i have
been observing unquestionable signs of
trichina in the muscles about the heart
today the symptoms are more pro-
nounced and the first thing you must do
is to begin treating the subject you re-
call that i explained to you thoroughly
that trichinosis is the curse of humans
and swine the nematoid parasites in
this subjects heart tissues and muscles
must be removed do you think you are
capable of doing it

  i have removed them on several oc-
casions from subject  dr lape she
said earnestly i can manage quite well
here now you run along and get some
rest i understand the situation per-
fectly

  good miss faversham he rasped
again wearily i know you do for
to-day and to-morrow you will give your
entire attention to subject  if it
shows no improvement we shall re-
move it from the solution and perform a
general removal of the parasites

  dot looked at him a bit disappoint-
edly

  i was going to beg off duty to-mor-
row dr lape she said quietly you
remember fm to be married this month
on the th to be exact i have some
last minute shopping to do-

  how stupid of me miss faver-
sham dr lake rasped here the
best assistant i ever had is going to
be married and like a stupid ass i failed
to show some consideration inwardly

he was smiling contentedly things were
playing into his hands of course you
may have a day off he added but
if you make it day after tomorrow i
will give you a little pre-wedding gift
that may help you to buy the things
necessary for a june bride

  thank you dr lapet she beamed
you are very considerate it will be
day after tomorrow then

  excellent he said pulling out a
check book and scrawling in his bold
hand a check on his bank here is
something to show my keen appreciation
for your helpful assistance during the
past years i have made it out to you
for five hundred

  five hundred dollars she accepted
the check in amazement arent you a
bit extravagant dr lape

  not a bit of it he laughed it
was like a cold cackle if i had paid
you near what you are worth it would
not have been too much take it and
enjoy yourself with my heartiest com-
pliments 

  he promptly turned away leaving her
standing at the test tube staring in-
credulously at the check it would more
than pay for her trousseau and the kind
of a colorful wedding she had always
wanted at the door he paused looked
at her cravingly and spoke again

  it would please me immensely miss
faversham he rasped cunningly to
have you and your fiance dine with me
to-morrow evening-just a little pre-
nuptial dinner can you arrange it
we shall be delighted dr lape
she enthused wondering if all the while
she had been mistaken in her presump-
tion that he was a man without a heart
i shall phone herbert this morning and
make sure it is very kind of you
good lape rasped his sunken
eyes gleamed i have wanted to offer
my congratulations to your fiance to
morrow evening then
the body pirate



  of course she replied we shall be
here at eight

  he waddled away but dr lape had
no thought of retiring much work was
yet to be done before the fatal hour
when his deformed body would be found
dead and his powerful cunning brain
assume control over the superbly per-
fect body of herbert strong he took
himself immediately to his secret lab-
oratory there the strange canines
hissed at him like angry felines the
cats barked and the two monkeys chat-
tered through their bars his first acts
were to get rid of them it would not
do to leave such evidence of his handi-
work and scientific skill behind to con-
demn him he promptly chloroformed
them and dumped the bodies into a
waste chute that carried them into a
roaring furnace in the cellar he al-
ways did things thoroughly and he made
a thorough job of burning his bridges
behind him as for the disposal of the
fifth dimension surgical apparatus as
intricate and astounding an instrument
of science as man had ever conceived
which stood on a small table encased in
glass well time enough to get rid of it
after the transferring that would be
the first task falling to the new herbert
strong 

  he spent the balance of the day de-
stroying all other evidence and in fram-
ing his will and last testament that
evening after dot had been driven away
by her fiance a local notary was called
to the mansion to attest to the legality of
the document thereafter until the
following evening time hung heavy on
his hands he found sleep impossible
in his excitement and anticipation of
completely molding himself with the
usurped body of another man he
avoided the laboratory afraid to trust
himself in the presence of dot faver-
sham lest she notice the trembling of his
hands and grow suspicious but when

evening came again he had complete
control over himself an injection of
drugs into his skinny arm saw to that

  at the quiet little dinner he had his
first opportunity to study herbert strong
at close quarters and was immensely
satisfied with what he saw in an im-
maculate tuxedo herbert strong re-
newed his envy he had the body-build
of a greek god and in contrast with his
own distorted frame he was a veritable
giant as they ate he silently studied the
shape and size of his large head and
masked his satisfaction with an un-
accustomed smile

  never before had he seen dot faver-
sham look so beautiful her golden hair
was set off effectively by her silver eve-
ning grown more than ever he felt his
desire to possess her and more than
ever he meant to do so much to dots
amazement he proved to be a perfect
host and he had given her a dinner that
might have graced the table of the rich-
est family in the city but dr lape
was not a man of many servants he
had only his housekeeper a gentle con-
siderate old lady who had been his per-
sonal nurse during his childhood she
was constantly at their service and
seemed to take a keen delight in the
occasion

  dinner finally over they retreated to
the library where they discussed casual
topics until dr lape cunningly in-
jected the subject of physical culture
training into the conversation instantly
herbert strong became alert nothing
interested him more unless it was dot
faversham than his owm profession it
was dr lape quickly learned his re-
ligion he believed in it devoutly as the
perfect cure for many of mans minor
ailments to this the scientist agreed
without comment and when the party
broke up he had herbert strongs prom-
ise to come at nine oclock the following
morning to see what could be done to-

ward strengthening his distorted body

  his guests gone dr merton lape
rubbed his bony hands contentedly
slipped out of his tuxedo and donned a
smock with infinite care he carried his
fifth dimension surgery apparatus
downstairs to the main laboratory where
he set it up at the head of two qperating
tables placed side by side after check-
ing it over carefully he retired to his
room chuckling contentedly to himself
in his dry rasping cackle for hours
thereafter he lay on his bed and visioned
himself enjoying as herbert strong
everything life had denied him it was
almost dawn when he fell into a fitful
sleep it gave him little rest and he
awoke to find the turning point of his
life close at hand

  true to his promise herbert strong
having hiked from town for the exer-
cise rang the doorbell promptly at nine
oclock drlape himself answered the
door

  good morning herbert he greeted
with all the cheeriness he could muster
 see you are a man of promptness i
like promptness come right in and we
shall get down to business immediately

  do not hurry on my account doc-
tor herb gave him a smile revealing
even white teeth that instantly made him
conscious of his own large yellow ones
fve got all the morning my assistant
is on hand at the gym to handle my
clients there

  he entered the mansion as incau-
tiously as a fly might dart into the in-
visible web of a spider dr lape forti-
fied for the occasion by an injection of
mild drugs let him into the laboratory
his sallow face was a mask again in-
scrutable cold his sunken eyes glit-
tered in their deep sockets like chips of
blue glacial ice and he was without
undue preliminaries ready to handle the
situation as promptly and thoroughly as
he did everything else hidden in one

of his bony hands was a small hypo-
dermic needle he stepped aside to al-
low his victim to enter first

  the instant herbert strong passed
through the door of the laboratory he
felt something sharp prick his right arm
with an involuntary grunt he glanced
over his shoulder to see his supposed
client leering at him with hypodermic
needle poised as if for another jab

  did you stick me with that thing
doctor  he tried hard to grin jokingly
through his astonishment what is this
a joke

  it is no joke herbert dr lape
rasped watching his eyes closely al-
ready they had become glassy he
chuckled contentedly  you dont think
i had you come here just to try to put
strength in the distorted thing i call my
body do you you ought to know that
is impossible or do you my friend
of course i know it lape herb
sensing danger flung back he ran a
trembling hand across his forehead it
was covered with sweat an unmistakable
indication of weakness emanating from
the powerful drug that had been in-
jected into his blood but its not my
business to deny anybody the right to
my services whats the idea you
tricked me into coming here

  i could think of no other way to get
you here my friend said lape un-
emotionally all is fair in love and
war isnt it

  herbert strong was awe-struck as he
tottered on his heels

  what the devil do you mean  he de-
manded with quick fury

  i mean herbert dr lape said
emphatically in a voice that sounded like
the rasp of steel against steel that i
too love dorothy faversham and intend
to marry her

  you - you - marry dot herb
strong was flabbergasted but he could
not help laughing despite the dizziness
the body pirate



that was sweeping over him thats the
funniest thing i ever heard lape you
and dot-getting married why you
wizened little anemic ive a notion to
turn you inside out

  why dont you herbert lape chal-
lenged with the same cool indifference
in a few more seconds you will be just
so much putty in my hands do you
know what i intend to do herbert

  murder me in cold blood i suppose
snapped herb helplessly he wanted to
sit down now his legs were weak and
his knees were trembling he fought
gamely to prevent his inevitable collapse
to the floor

  that my friend the love-mad sci-
entist said is not-my intention i have
other plans i am going to usurp your
body herbert strong fm virtually
going to steal it and when it is in my
possession and under the domination of
my own brain im going through with
your plans for marrying miss faver-
sham do you follow me herbert
no i see that you do not i will speak
plainer fm going to remove your
brain from your skull and transplant my
own in its place now you follow me
dont you my friend it is all so
simple

  herbert strong blinked at him incred-
ulously wondering if his ears were play-
ing pranks on him

  why you low-down murderer he
raged suddenly feeling blackness settling
down over him he made a feeble at-
tempt to grab at his tormentors throat
but his clutching fists fell far short of
their mark he slumped down to the
floor feeling as if he were falling rap-
idly into a bottomless stygian pit

  chuckling dr lape quickly locked
the door then with an amazing exhi-
bition of strength for such a twisted
body as his own he lifted up the inert
form of his victim upon one of the op-
erating tables as if impatient to pos-

sess that superbly perfect physique as his

very own he worked speedily yet with
an expertness born of long practice

  with the silent form of herbert
strong once on the table and at his com-
plete mercy he lost no time his sallow
face was distorted into a covetous mask
now his sunken eyes blazed with the
kind of a look that might have been ex-
pected of a miser quickly he placed
a metal helmet over the others skull
making sure that its internal electrodes
fitted snuggly against his frontal parietal
and occipital lobes other electrodes if
such they were fitted firmly against the
skull directly over the cerebrum and
cerebellum along the seams of the
cranial bones ran literally dozens of
other small discs to which were attached
as many tiny tubes and wires connected
to the fifth dimension surgery devise
at the tables

  the fifth dimension surgery ap-
paratus was something in itself to in-
spire wonder to the layman it would
have looked like some sort of a scales
but instead of having saucer like pans
on its metal arms it had ball-coils no-
body but dr lape understood or could
explain its intricate details though it
was easily seen to derive its strange
power from electrical energy in truth
it did but in vibration only dr lape
had discovered the fifth dimension in
electrical vibrations and into this appar-
atus he had embodied them accomplish-
ing as a result the impossible transmuta-
tion of matter from one body to another
without blood scars or other tell-tale
evidence of an operation

  as delicate and fragile as some min-
iature swiss watch movement the in-
strument was filled with tiny coil-
springs pendulums and platinum wires
under each of the two ball-coils was a
small green vacuum tube which appar-
ently controlled the vibrations as they
entered the dual helmets the one already


amazing stories

snugly fixed on herbert strongs skull
and the other which dr lape was to
fit over his own head

  one might wonder how the transmu-
tation could be performed without the
assistance of a third person but dr
lape had seen to that the whole thing
was to be controlled by an amazing
robot switch-timed by a stationary
chronometer an amazing brilliant man
was dr lape and he overlooked noth-
ing as was his custom

  satisfied that the helmet was at-
tached perfectly to herbert strongs
head he promptly placed himself on
the other table sitting there he donned
the second helmet perfectly calm su-
premely confident and fearless as to the
outcome of his piracy of another mans
body he coolly jabbed his skinny arm
with his hypodermic needle then turned
on the robot switch everything was set
now for the transmutation even to the
slight mis-adjustment of the wires that
controlled all life on his table he was
perfectly aware that when the robot had
gone the cycle of its time he alone
would be a dead man but herbert
strong would be alive and in his cranium
would be his dr lapes own super-
brain 

  the instant he turned on the robot
switch the fifth dimension surgery ap-
paratus went into action the twin vac-
uum tubes glowed softly the ball-coils
began to vibrate gathering momentum
gradually pendulums swung slowly at
first then rapidly as seconds ticked off
on the chronometer

  as dr lape succumbed to his injec-
tion of drugs he felt a strange vibratory
movement in his brain as if the fifth
dimension apparatus was painlessly
loosening the tissues and preparing it
for transmutation with a smile on his
thin colorless lips he became inert con-
fident that when he awoke he would be
in full possession of a new and superbly

perfect body and dot faversham

unsuspectingly would be waiting for
him with open arms

  as the vibrations tugged at herbert
strongs brain he grew tense his
strong constitution was fighting at the
drugs that the other had so ruthlessly
and treacherously injected into his blood
stream vaguely he was aware that
something was wrong as the vibrations
increased he felt a severe deadening
ache at the base of his skull in a
stupor he tried to figure out what was
wrong with him but got nowhere in that
direction yet he was sure something
was tugging at his brain as if some in-
visible instruments were cutting its tis-
sues and nerve centers and pulling it in
a sort of suction from his skull

  a sever stab of pain suddenly struck
at the backs of his eyes he wrenched
as if shot and as he did so he rolled clear
of the table the helmet was yanked
from his head it clattered on the
floor beside him rolled a few inches and
came into contact with the metal legs of
the table instantly there was a blinding
flash from the laboratory green flame
wiggled and crackled over dr lapes
great fifth dimension surgical appar-
atus platinum wires melted the green
vacuum tubes burned bright for an in-
stant and exploded the distorted body
of dr lape twitched on his table every
muscle in his withered body seemed to
tighten suddenly he relaxed with a dis-
mal sigh his sunken eyes opened wide
and his jaw sagged

  dr merton lape had finally made an
error thorough in all things as he had
been he had overlooked one thing
time time and herbert strongs pow-
erful constitution he should have ad-
ministered another dose of his drug to
the man whose body he had so pains-
takingly labored to steal but in his ex-
citement and impatience to come into
the body pirate



possession of that body he had over-
looked that all-important detail  his
would-be victim simply revived ahead of

schedule as a surgical patient might
emerge too soon from his ether he lay
on the floor in a nauseating stupor
aware that he was there yet having little
or no control over his faculties

  short-circuited by the contact of the
helmet with the leg of the table the
fifth dimension surgical device went
up in smoke its fragile machinery melt-
ing into worthless masses as it did so
dr lape might have strapped the body
of his intended victim to the table and
prevented such a catastrophe but he
had been aware that such a precau-
tionary measure would have rendered
him helpless after the transmutation he
would have been unable to loosen him-
self  his own distorted body dead
herbert strong would have been com-
pelled to lie on the table helplessly
strapped to await the coming of dot
faversham to free him the cat would
have escaped the bag then

  just how long he lay on the floor
herbert strong had no way of knowing
his wrist-watch had been smashed in
his fall it seemed that he had lain
there for ages before he suddenly heard
the shriek of an auto horn somewhere
outside it was the horn of his own
car which he had loaned to dot that
morning her own auto being tempo-
rarily out of commission she was to call
for him at the lape mansion at noon
once again the horn blared out its call
he struggled to rise like a drunken man
his senses reeled and all the strength
seemed to have fled from his powerful
legs his head ached violently and his
eyes felt as if they had been jabbed with
needles he managed to get to his
knees and then he collapsed back out-
side dot tooted again a bit impatiently
if he could only get a drink of water to
wet his burning lips and throat he

tried again to rist only to sink back with
swimming senses

  wondering if something was wrong
in the big house or if her fiance had
already left the place and returned to
town dot hurried to the front door
and admitted herself with her own key
inside the place was quiet as a tomb
herbs cap hanging on a rack in the
hall caught her eyes she knew then
that he was still in the house for a
man seldom walks off leaving his hat
she went straight to the library it
was deserted she wondered where the
housekeeper was but dr lape had
also given her a day off that he might
have absolute privacy during the trans-
mutation

  inspired with the idea that the two
men might be in the laboratory she
went there the door was locked as
she inserted her key she heard a low
groan from within sensing something
wrong she hastily flung open the door
instantly she saw herbert strong
struggling gamely to attain his feet she
rushed in with a cry of alarm

  herbert she cried anxiously
what has happened

  he looked at her stupidly

  water he muttered get me a
drink dot please

  she ran quickly past the tables toward
the faucet as she did so she had her
first glimpse of dr lape she needed
only one passing glance at his face to
tell her he was dead his jaw sagged
and his eyes were popped wide open
she stifled a sob snatched up a glass
and filled it from the faucet herb
strong gulped its contents in a single
swallow from a medicine chest she
grabbed a bottle of smelling salts
strength returned swiftly to herbs
body under its powerful effect she
helped him up

  what has happened herbert she

demanded again glancing at dr lape
and shuddering

  youve got me there dot he
said holding his aching head in his
hands i dont know except that
lape had a crazy idea that he was
going to steal my body imagine such
an insane idea he was going to re-
move my brain and put his own in its
place then he was going to marry
you thats all i know except that
the minute he got me in here he jabbed
me with a hypodermic needle i just
passed out until i saw or thought i
saw a blinding flash of light then i
found myself on the floor since then
ive been wondering if he actually did
transplant his brain into my head i
guess he didnt for i recognized the
sound of my car hom when you
tooted it

  oh dot gasped in astonishment
how terrible i might have known he
was up to something he was working
at nights ill bet he was working on
something to make it possible for him
to steal your body thats what he
meant when he told me there might be
a way out for him after he had proposed

marriage to me and was promptly re-
jected 

  did he propose to you dot herb
scowled

  yes herbert she replied i might
as well tell you it was during the
winter and his proposal came to me as
a complete surprise i was stunned v
humph herb grunted he had
a lot of crust trying to steal my body
and my girl but hell never try it
again look at him his face is
burned black

  dot shuddered grasped his arm and
led him away

  perhaps it serves him right her-
bert she sobbed but he really was
a brilliant man he contributed many
invaluable things to science he should
be remembered as a great scientist
you mean he should be remembered
as a body pirate dot grunted herb
i hate to think what would have hap-
pened to me if he had succeeded
dont herbert she whispered
just think of our wedding day and
what it means for us

  as if i could forget that dot he
grinned

er-skinny what next take one of the
aristocrats in your hands doesnt it flap un-
comfortably over your hands if you hold it in
the middle and plop in the center when you
hold the ends

  now take one of the undignified ones and
hold it see how it snuggles just so in your
hands isnt it more easy to hold last of

all compare the pages and number of stories
and well any way what difference does the
size make a s will be good old a s
whether it be twelve inches high or six inches
high and it will still retain its dignity in any
size as long as the words amang stories
appear across the front

  the covers were all fine except the one on
the oct issue made me kind of uncomfortable
may a s survive long enough to gain some
martian and venerian readers but i am
afraid our dear old ed wont be the editor
by that time many regrets also we present
readers will be under the sod many centuries
by that time at any rate long live a s

editor amazing stories

  i would like to say that your editorial article
under the heading the sphere of vapor is
very instructive and interesting i would like
to see more of them in your future numbers

  the moon waits is another interesting
subject in which are found accounts of actual
events mixed with some fiction more or less
fantastic or extravagant but nevertheless good
enough to hold the readers attention

  the land of twilight seems to be a very
good serial judging by the first seven chapters
of part one i like the style and the way the
tory is started keeping the readers in suspense
and expectation for the following events of the
story it is filled with adventures that keep
the imagination alert there is also the facts
mixed with fiction and of course the human
side of the story that gives the characters a
very realistic atmosphere

i will close these lines thanking you for
giving us a new author and for keeping those

comments on mr verrills story

the heart of the andes

editor amazing stories

  my congratulations to you and a hyatt
verrill through the andes is in my hum-
ble opinion a masterpiece of science fiction

  the fact that mr verriirs premise as to
the origin of the aztec and toltec peoples co-
incides with the book of mormon takes noth-
ing from the originality of his story the
plot is well conceived the theme is carried
through nicely and the characterization is ex-
cellent

a pleasant letter from the far-off
dominion of new zealand

editor amazing stories

  this is just another letter from n z to
show you that your sorry i mean our
magazine is appreciated even in this far corner
of the world i have heard that a large num-
ber of americans think that n z is a town
in australia if that is so it is sure some little
town it is inconceivable to my mind that
anyone could think that a country like n z
which is larger in size than england should
be thought of as a town in australia

  but wait i am wandering from the subject
our mag ive been a silent reader of
amazing stories for five years now i
was first attracted to it by a nice bright and
truly amazing cover many readers complain
that your covers are too lurid and they want
quiet covers instead of amazing ones well
what i want to know is why do they read the
magazine at all the name of the magazine
is amazing stories and when a person buys
that magazine he expects to be amazed
so the cover is a good start if you make it
sufficiently amazing and the brighter the better
some covers which i think were really out-
standing in fact super-excellent were febru-
ary september august  january no-

vember and december  january febru-
ary october november  january march
september and november  march april
june october and november  february
and may  super super excellent sep-
tember  october  january feb-
ruary march april and july 

  the cover picture for the june  issue
of amazing stories wasnt in keeping with
the name of the mag at all

  now about the stories i enjoy eighty-five
percent of them and as for the others i suppose
some one else enjoys them

  i wish you would reprint the moon pool
by merritt again but i suppose the cost of
reprinting would be too high altogether to
warrant doing that ive read both the sky-
lark stories with much enjoyment and even
though i still have the mags with those stories
in i wouldnt mind at all if you reprinted them
again especially as one of your competitors is
printing the third skylark story lots of
readers who read skylark of valeron will
want to read the earlier adventures of the sky-
lark so theres your chance

  the professor jameson stories are great
please give us more some great stories which
appeared in a s in the past are the sixth
glacier by marius futility by capt s p
meek the chamber of life by g peyton
wertenbaker colour out of space into the
green prism and the sequel beyond the
green prism by a hyatt verrill the metal
horde by john campbell jr the green
girl by jack williamson the valley of
titans by l a eshbach the stone from
the green star by jack williamson the
lost machine by john r harris all neil
r jones stories and david h kellers and
e e smiths and a merritts

  i did not like any of a sigmonds covers
and i am glad that they are now a thing of
the past id like to see the old amazing
stories title back on the cover again the
one which started off with a large a and
gradually dwindled off smaller and smaller is
there any hope if you dont hurry up and
give us straight and even edges to our mag
ill-ill-send you an earthquake surely it
would not cost very much more for straight
edges and it would improve the looks of the
magazine  per cent and also it would be
one in the eye of your competitors

  may i draw your attention to a mistake in
the numbering of the quarterlies the 
fall-winter edition was numbered vol  no

	which was correct the following issues
were numbered wrongly as follows 
spring-summer vol  no   winter
vol  no   fall vol  no  they
should have been  spring-summer vol
 no   winter vol  no  and 
fall vol  no  i was surprised that no
one else pointed out this mistake to you

  i still need a few issues of amazing
stories to complete my set perhaps some
of your readers can help me if this letter ever
appears in the discussions columns the issues
i require are vol  nos       and 
vol  nos    and  quarterly vol 
no 

  well i am afraid ill have to close now it
has taken me five years to write this letter
i wonder if it will be another five years before
i write again somehow i dont think so
but in any case you can always count on me as
a staunch supporter of amazing stories

  here s wishing you and your staff the best
of luck and may amazing stories keep
on amazing for many years to come and thanks
for the many hours of enjoyment that i have
had out of your magazine

  p s just a little brickbat please dont
publish any more of the stories written by
jules verne or poe even here they are pro-
curable in the public library

  it is quite amusing that anyone should be
so ignorant of geography as to call new zea-
land a town in australia it is true that there
is nothing which a large number of americans
may not think but we are inclined to believe
that you do them an injustice about new zea-
land if you enjoy  of our stories we are
quite complimented the old futuristic covers
which were tried for a while have been def-
initely abandoned they lasted about as long
or perhaps longer than they were worthy to
endure the quarterlies come out so irreg-
ularly that the dating of them may seem
staggering you will probably find it difficult
to get the very early numbers of amazing
stories but your letter may bring results

  a letter from australia-the magazin
there and its slowness of issue
editor amazing stories 

  i have been reading your publication con-
tinuously for the last three years but this is
the first time i have ever dared to write i have
been aroused from my usual good-humored self
by these confounded reprints some readers
i note seem unable to get them but here in
australia every little bookstall has one or two
copies so mr editor discontinue your re-
prints unless they be the lauded stories of
your early issues such as skylark three
spacehounds of ipc and stories about arcot
wade and morey etc otherwise your mag-
azine is a- at lloyds

  here in australia unless issues are three
months old the price is equivalent to c and
last year it was equivalent to about c so

you see most fans here read the august issue
in november so i can look forward to seeing
this letter in the new year of your magazine
that is if you decide to publish it i have one
brickbat i do not like moreys covers and
illustrations let there be an outcry at such
a statement nevertheless i consider wesso
to be the fines science-fiction artist ever since
this kind of fiction was started oh well

  if you will read our discussions you will
find that there are many readers who enjoy

practically giving no reprints we do not
see why there should be so much delay on our
australian readers getting their magazines we
will take it up with our circulation manager
and we shall hope that he will get rid of the
trouble we should think that there will be
many who would enjoy correspondence with

effect of a letter printed in discussion-
suggestion about reprints

editor amazing stories

  i wish to thank you for your courtesy in
printing my letter in the discussions depart-
ment of the october  issue of amazing
stories this letter concerned back numbers
which i had to sell

  in your editorial comment under my letter
you mentioned that you had never heard
whether this type of letter had ever done any
good or not i am now reporting immediately
following the appearance of that issue on the
new stands i was fairly deluged with inquiries
as a result i have disposed of my entire col-
lection which consisted of several hundred
magazines

  while i did write to several names i found
in the readers department of the various
science fiction magazines most credft goes to
the letter you published incidentally i wrote
similar letters to each of your rivals at the
same time one of them gave me mention
while the other ignored my request completely

  for my part i can say that the printing of
my letter produced exactly the result desired
thank you again for your kindness in this
matter

  and in closing allow me to make one com-
ment about the reprint quarterly that is a
fine idea there were some great stories
printed in a s in its early days why not
print the moon pool complete in an early
issue also the land that time forgot
by burroughs why not an entire h g wells
quarterly sometime my suggestion would be

    a charming letter from a mother of
seven boys
editor amazing stories

  your magazine is surely improving and i
think it is the aristocrat of science fiction
it was very good in the early days of its ex
istence then in - the book rather
slumped to my mind but now it suits us in
every way size cover and printing

  through the andes was very good but
then a hyatt verrill is always good and he
with coblentz and keller are ray favorites

   i am a busy little housewife and mother of
seven boys but i am never too busy for science
fictions engrossing stories to whet my mind
and they always teach me a lot too

   i have given away stacks and stacks of your
magazines with others to high school boys
and interested persons

   i wish i could get a hold of the quarterly
which contains seeds of life by taine i
have some real old quarterlies i would ex-
change

   please print as many stories as you can by
verrill the discussions are the first tfart
of the book that i read

   i dont care for reprints as ive read all of
them and so the last quarterly was a disap-
pointment to me

  yours for a long life and success in our
good magazine

it is a comfort to have someone say that our
magazine is improving the seeds of life
appeared in the quarterly issue for fall 
we will see if we can find it for you as
things are going now in this world of ours it
is pleasant to hear from a proud mother and
we know you are that with your seven boys
more of verrill work will appear very soon
he is not only a good writer but an archaeol-
ogist we are pretty certain that your letter
will receive a response-editor

mr skidmore replies to the criticism of mr
a c clarke of england which appeared
in the february issue in discussions

editor amazing stories

   now my british critic you say first of all
that i used the word stratoscope in  the
velocity of escape score one for you my
critical friend  i intended to use the word
stratosphere i dictate my stories rapidly
and afterwards spend long hours correcting
but the word is an error

   of course i know there is no such word as
stratoscope and be assured that i will turn
a disintegrating ray on my secretary to punish
her and i will also have my own eyes exam-
ined and if you insist my brain box

   im fully aware that the troposphere is the
first circle of atmosphere ranging from xqyz
miles in height at the equator and about 
miles at the poles and in this area the tem-
perature decreases with approximately uniform
rate from the earths surface the layer above
this is called the stratosphere in times past
it was called the isothermal region in the
stratosphere there is no convection and it is
estimated to extend to  miles

   i purposely created cromwell as an inquisi-
tive and somewhat dumb assistant for the
academic millstein dont you see my english
censorious friend that cromwell is made
merely a foil that i the author might ex-
pand and display my scientific knowledge-
or the gods forbid the lack of it

  in the the velocity of escape i merely
had millstein say cromwell ive a hunch
the falcons factories are on that star
sirius in a few weeks we will take a trip
to sirius and look around millstein did not
go to sirius i knew of the extreme heat on
sirius and its mighty distance and i only
mentioned sirius because in the paragraphs
preceding millsteins unwise words i had been
proudly airing some interesting facts about
sirius the dog star your objection as to
the vast distance to sirius is not a fair one
some of the finest science fiction stories writ-
ten have caused their protagonists to journey
at many times the speed of light to stars and
space more distant than sirius science fic-
tion is an interesting mixture of fact and fancy
and we authors have to take lots of license
your point on the temperature of sirius is
well taken sirius would indeed be an uncom-
fortable place for the falcon or millstein
resourceful as they are i have already writ-
ten a sequel wherein millstein goes after the
villainous falcon and millstein goes to
venus so my english cousin i score an-
other point for you even if youre a bit super-
technical friend do you not fail to see the
beautiful forest because of the trees

you also object to my atomic theory of pro-
tons and electrons you say the discovery
march 

amazing stories



you should say theory that atoms contain
positive electrons and neutral particles has up
set all that

  im fully aware that recent theories let us
stick to the word theories set up that the
nucleus of an atom is not properly said to con-
sist of protons and electrons and that these
new theories claim that no unassociated elec-
trons occur that the positron or positive
electron is a positively charged particle very
small detached from the proton and exists
at only high velocities that the neutron con-
sists of a proton-electron compact combination
of a small size millions of times smaller than
the normal hydrogen atom that it is believed
such neutrons and positrons are present in
various atoms as science advances the struc-
ture of the atom becomes more complex

  for many of my forty years i have all the
while keenly aware of my vast limitations
been an ardent student of science ive tried
vainly perhaps to keep apace with the glor-
ious march of science

  as you perhaps know my friend and critic
ive published in amazing stories a series
of the atomic adventures of posi and nega
and theres to be more published of the tiny
electrons-if nega doesnt become angry with
the irrepressible posi and short circuit him

  before undertaking to write the posi and
nega stories and other yarns in which i set
up the atomic structure of sundry elements i
decided definitely to stick closely to the proton-
electron theory for the puzzling atoms

  my first reason was for arts sake you
must concede that it is easier and more under-
standable for posi to be a positive electron
or proton and nega a free negative elec-
tron both in an atom of hydrogen-and let it
go at that if we science fiction authors in-
volve our narrations with too many abstruse
theories our mss would be merely scientific
essays we must have an understandable sim-
plicity of theory in our stories and as long as
we stick to basic facts we should not be unduly
criticized science fiction is difficult to write
-at least for me

  my second reason for using in my stories
only the proton-electron theory is that this is
the older and accepted standard of chemistry
this old rule is to discover the make-up of
any element take the full number of the atomic
weight that represents the number of protons
in the nucleus as in a gold atom  now the
number of free electrons is represented by the
atomic number in the case of a gold atom 
the nucleus of a gold atom therefore consists
of  protons and  minus  leaves 
nuclear electrons the marvels of chemistry
have amply proved this theory with numerical
certainty

  no doubt my english friend the later scien-
tists are right that there are these newly dis-

covered positrons and neutrons in the atoms

  but for good cogent writing i must stick
for the present at least to the simplest atomic
description im trying to express with my
futile pen the aggregate metamorphic picture
which science has developed in the last decade

  in one of the future posi and nega stories
im going to consider having posi the pro-
ton and nega the negative electron come
into actual contact and form a neutron tell
me fans shall i say they get marriod

  or maybap iu have posi the proton
lose a small particle from his mass because of
some great heat increasing his speed to the
danger point the lost particle will become
a positron

  ill leave it to you my readers shall this
weak pen attempt such a daring and intricate
theme

  i warn you if i do ill probably get into
deep technical waters and sink into oblivion-
forever

  the readers of amazing stories are stu-
dents and thinkers they take the meat from
the stories and digest it but they are wise
enough to spit out the bones

  and now ray friend and critic allow me
to give you a word of criticism or advice
dont take the last theory of the atom as final
or that it settles the whole abstruse problem
we may have a new and wonderful discovery
any day a theory which can be proved beyond
the question of doubt keep your mind open
and receptive this is the age of wonders

  and now that ive got this technical answer
off my mind i want to admit frankly that im
only a student of science floundering sluggishly
at the bottom of a vast sea of yet undiscovered
wonders of knowledge but its better to give
you a pain in the neck than never to be
noticed at all 

  and sincerely ifm glad to have your crit-
icism and grateful for this chance to give
amazing readers ray ideas and thoughts

  here i am again i suppose you regard me
as a monthly pest by now something that cant
be helped youll probably take one look at
the printing on the envelope and throw it in
the good old w b right away

  well here come the onions and roses right
through from cover to discussions

  cover-pretty good but why does morey
always make such spindley legs on people 
while were on the subject of pictures i want
to ask you to get somebody besides morey for
illustrations sq that hell have some competi-
tion when he has some competition morey
will perk up and draw much better

  stories-rape of the solar system a very
good yam even if it was rather blood-and-
thundery sunless world-super-melagor-
geous stupendolossal the mag was worth
two bits for this story alone the first pro-
fessor jameson story i have read although ive
heard of his fame for a long time heres to
many more stories like it beyond the uni-
verse fair men created for death swell
nothing extra just a good story the mil-
lion dollar gland-fair

  on the whole a very good issue well worth
c in any mans country i think amazing
is improving steadily and if you continue to
improve and get back the large size or at least
the old lettering on the cover youll soon be
back on par with the good old days and ill be
one satisfied reader

  the rape of the solar system by miss

world by jones was excellent men cre-
ated for death by kostkos was good the
million dollar gland and beyond the uni-
verse were fair the serial land of twi-
light by preston is coming along fine of
course the discussions are always good

side illustrations than on the covers

a complimentary letter from a young reader
who started years ago to read amazing

the past in not being as good as it should have
been-editor-

standing at attention with closed eyes-
sympathetic sound vibrations

editor amazing stories 

  this is the second letter i have written to
you since amazing stories first was pub-
lished there are two experiments that i
would like explained

  -one	evening at a gathering at my home
for the sake of amusement we were trying-
tricks etc a friend of mine told me to get
up stand at attention then to close my eyes
no sooner were my eyes shut than i began to
sway forward and backward several others
tried it and the results were the same

  -taking	an hawaiian guitar which is
tuned and plucking one of the e strings i
have noticed that the other es will also begin
to vibrate pluck the a and the other a will
vibrate also of course the strings must be well
tuned now i know that one e will sound
another e because theyre octaves but each
octave is twice the number of vibrations of the
one next to it arent the sound waves vibra-
tions also twice the length of one octave to
the other will you kindly give me a more
correct explanation

as to the amazing stories magazine

i suppose i couldnt write anything that hasnt
been said before but i do want to repeat that
i like to ee our mag back to its former size
march 

amazing stories



and the same old title the stories well there
is nothing to kick about the variety is great
the drawings well there i must differ as has
been said before mr morey is a wonderful
artist as is proven by the cover even paul
couldnt find fault with it but the inside il-
lustrations are too much like those common
mags and thats what hurts by that i dont
mean his drawings but his shadings why
cant they be more on a definite clear outline
ink drawing like those of mr paul please
excuse this criticism but mr morey draws
too well to hide anything in haziness

the fact that a blind person can stand at at-
tention suggests that your trouble in maintain-
ing your position was due to what are some-
times called nerves

  any string when sounded will start strings
one or more octaves below into harmonic or
overtone vibrations the strings must be ex-
actly one octave or a number of octaves below
the sounding strings if a string besides giving
the fundamental note also gives overtones then
it will start vibrations in strings above it by
the action of the overtones

  your drawing enclosed in your letter is very
interesting-editor

be the last and i like it immensely as i have
always been one of those who believe that any-

about that i know nothing but this i do know
that a tremendous one occurred some sixteen
years ago i thought some of your readers
might be interested in the facts of the case
as far as i have been able to ascertain i am
the only person who witnessed the occurrence
it was some six weeks forgot the exact date
before we of the a l horse took damascus
i was in charge of the  regs horse pickets
near ludd in palestine about  a m i
reached the top of the slight rise on which our
horse lines were situated and turned to go down
again as i turned i was amazed to see shoot
out from mars who was on the almost level
with my eyes a great blast as from a search
light followed some second or two seconds
later by another my thoughts instantly flew
to what i had heard re supposed signals from
mars but what i saw could not have been
signals for while somewhat resembling a
searchlight beam they were far too broad for

their length in color the first flash was like
that of the first half of a searchlight beam

i	e the half nearest the light the second sev-
eral degrees less bright

and shall advise all of my friends to do the
same i hope i shall have the privilege of see-
ing another one of these stories in print soon

it is of distinct value to get such letters as
yours criticising one or more stories the
judgment of our readers is one of the con-
trolling factors in our work sometimes to be
modified in our use of it we shall always be
glad to hear from you-editor

criticism of the december issue-
back numbers wanted

editor amazing stories

  i think amazing stories is improving
greatly one thing you oould improve on is
your covers i believe that there should be
more covers showing space ships and different
means of interplanetary transportation

  concerning the december issue these are
the ones i thought the best  the sunless
world most of it was pretty good but there
were a few parts that were a bit too fantastic

	u men created for death this story does
not seem so far ahead of the times as most
of the others

  i dont know why you printed the million
dollar gland i thought it was terrible

  i would like to buy a few of the back num-
bers i wish some of your readers who have
these numbers for sale cheaply would com-
municate with me

  for back numbers you might address sub-

probably get letters from readers who have
them to dispose of-editor


amazing stories

march 

the land of twilight and noekken of
norway highly approved of

editor amazing stories 

  for some time though not regularly t have
been thrilled by your magazine amazing
stories some of the stories are truly amazing
and some amazing to the point of delightful
ness i do love a good wholesome play-of-the
imagination to snap me out of my pokey and
sordid dullness and give me entirely different
mental pictures to gaze at with my minds eye
this last number of yours i thought especially
good and when i struck the new and imagin-
ative serial land of twilight most alluring
and promising title by robert page preston
and when i had finished reading it i felt like
a new person i found myself playing with
this thought and that conjured from the story
for quite some time after i had finished read-
ing it goes without saying that i am eager
for the continuation of the story-in fact i hope
it will go on and on in the same vein for
quite some time

  i think your illustrator is delightful too i
know that it was his fascinating picture of the
weird lake in norway that made a deep im-
pression of that story in my mind

like all or nearly ail normal personalities
an editor this particular one at any rate needs
encouragement an interesting thing about
noekken of norway is that the author spent
some months in that delightful country where
the editor also spent some very happy weeks
one summer it has real atmosphere-editor

an admirer of jules verne tells how he
came to read amazing stories

editor amazing stories

  i have been an interested reader of amazing
stories since the first issue of april  and
i have every copy in as good condition as when
i received them i go over them quite often
and in comparing the earlier issues with the
present ones i find that there was much better
illustrations in the former for me paul was
the best artist that amazing stories ever had

  i am glad that you went back to having the
cover design illustrate a scene in one of the
stories the few issues that you put out with
futuristic covers seemed silly

  i notice that every time that you publish a
jules verne story there is always a lot of crit-
icism but that is because they do not under-
stand him jules verne is a master the same
as verdi and wagner and mozart in the
musical world a lot of people will listen to
some tunes that are thrown together by some-
body that hardly knows one note from another
and as long as there is a lot of noise they say
it is good while they will say that the great
classics are dull

  jules vernes works were written many years
ago and are still read why is that it is be-
cause they are masterpieces ill bet that not
many of the stories that are published in
amazing stories will be read  years from
now

  take for example the last story measuring
a meridian the science is exact the method
is exact after reading it almost anyone could
go out and measure a meridian himself and
the description of the country is just about
what it was at the time it was written in
every one of his stories the science is exact
the characters are true to life and the scenes
are described fully then there are generally
brought in some bits of history frequently
some history of a scientific nature that is not
generally known compare that with fantastic
stories of space ships that go thousands of
light years in a few seconds and harnessing
the power of hundreds of suns and in which
the science is not nearly right

  it was an advertisement in sci-ence and in-
vention saying that a new magazine would be
published and that all of jules vernes stories
would be published that started me reading
amazing stories sometimes it has been hard
to get the magazine after the canadian gov-
ernment put a duty on them and they stopped
coming into canada but i always managed to
get them

  personally i prefer the large size it seemed
more dignified and looked better on the shelves

                                    canada

  amazing stories is now being published
in canada so there should be no difficulty in
getting copies write to us if you are troubled
in this matter you are perfectly correct in
your estimate of the works of jules verne
he built up a great appreciation of his works
in science fiction-editor

a new readers appreciation-a corre-
spondent of the fair sex

editor amazing stories 

  today i stumbled upon your magazine
amazing stories the stories seem to be
highly imaginative and verj entertaining

  one story i liked was the serial just started
land of twilight by robert page preston
it gave me many things to think about at least
to wonder about and i hope it will continue in
the next edition

  i know my husband is going to like your
magazine too when he gets home tonight
