 state-
a department for readers conducted by captain ranger

the thanksgiving turkey is an old
american tradition raising the lus-
cious drumsticks and plenty of white
meat on a wholesale scale is a fast-growing
industry out in the west

  many of the western states offer good
opportunities for turkey ranching and tur-
keys like cattle set out on the open range
will do a good deal of their foraging for
themselves

  the custom of making turkeys the holi-
day dinner bird began with the pilgrim fore-
fathers clear across the country and moved
westward with the changing frontier of the
united states yet raising them in the west
is as it should be

  the wild turkeys the puritans found in
new england were not originally native to
that part of the country they simply mi-
grated from their ancestral home long be-
fore the pilgrims got the idea and were in
reality direct descendants of the mexican
wild turkey so were all the other wild tur-
keys found spread across the continent

its a mexican bird

  since authorities are pretty well agreed
that all present varieties of our domestic
turkey have descended from north ameri-
can wild stock it follows believe it or not
that our most uniquely american dinner
dish was originally a mexican bird

  the great glistening bronze variety still
the turkey growers and the turkey eaters
favorite was even domesticated first by some
of the ancient indian tribes of the south-
west the indians raised them not for culi-
nary purposes but for their fine decorative
feathers-a favorite item of indian orna-
ment

big business

  today on an increasing number of west-
ern turkey ranches it is merely a case of the
turkeys coming home to roost they belong
there and they do well there particularly
in a dry or semi-dry climate

  turkey ranches have become big business
in the west texas alone raises some five
million of the birds annually making it the
nations leading turkey producing state
every second year cuero about half way
between san antonio and port lavaca and
one of texas big turkey-packing centers
holds a regular turkey festival known as the
turkey trot

  thousands of prize birds lead by a band
complete with comely high-stepping baton-
twirling drum majorettes are paraded down
cueros main street followed by gay floats
carrying the queen of the festival and her
attendants as usual it is a joyous occasion
for all concerned but the turkeys most of
the handsome birds are marched right on to
the waiting pens of the big packing plants
where they are made ready for the tables
of a turkey-hungry nation

grazing turkeys

  some of the bigger turkey ranchers in
texas and the west raise as many as ten or
twenty thousand birds a year such large
flocks are generally grazed like sheep being
tended by regular turkey herders hired by
the owner of the turkey spread

  grazing turkeys on open range requires a
lot of space and a turkey herder going off
into the back country with his flock usually
takes care of between fifteen hundred and
two thousand birds-with the aid of a good
trained sheep dog to help him his cara-
van makes quite a picture generally it con-
sists of three or four wagons

  first is the wagon in which he makes his
living quarters likely fitted up with the cook
stove chimney sticking through the canvas
top the other wagons contain roosts built
in the shape of a letter a turkeys like to
roost at night if in desert country or at a
dry camp the turkey herder has to carry
along often in an extra wagon water for
his flock his stock and himself

  camp is generally moved once a week or
every ten days not so much to provide the
birds with fresh forage-feed is taken along
for the birds by the herder-but to keep
them on clean ground clean ground plays
a large part in keeping the birds healthy
and free from disease

they spook easy

  if you think a turkey herders life is a
cinch guess again it is quite a specialized
job turkeys will spook easily especially on
moonlight nights and stampede just like cat-
tle rounding up a turkey flock after a
sudden night-time stampede is no easy mat-
ter a chore to try the patience of a job-
even with a dog to help

  in addition the herder and his dog must
protect the flock against prowling coyotes
and skunks in country where the striped
kitty is part of the natural scenery

  big turkey spreads of the turkey herder
type are operated in idaho washington
oregon texas and perhaps other western
sections favorable to that style of feathered
ranching some large spreads and many
turkey ranches are on the other hand op-
erated under fence the birds being moved
from pasture to pasture as the season pro-
gresses

small flocks

  and of course a great many small farm
flocks of birds are raised annually through-
out the country-from maine to california
from minnesota down to florida-as part of
diversified farm operations these birds
however are not raised on special turkey
ranches as the term is understood in the
west

  in any event whether or not you eventual-
ly contemplate a full scale turkey spread it
is wise to start in a relatively small way and
start with good quality pure bred birds it
costs no more to feed and raise to market
size a pure bred turkey than it does to raise
a scrub yet the difference in the bringing
price between the two is considerable

standard varieties

  among the several standard pure bred
turkey varieties recognized by the american
poultry association are the bronze white
holland bourbon red narragansett black
and slate

  recently some turkey breeders have been
specializing in developing succulent pint-
sized birds-just large enough for a small
family to get away with at one or two sit-
tings with maybe enough left-over for a

what makes
writing ability grow

  for a number of years the newspaper institute of amer-
ica has been giving free writing aptitude teats-to men and
women with literary ambitions

  sometimes it seems half the people in america who ar
fired with the desire to write have taken advantage of thia
offer to measure their ability

what the tests show

  up to date no one who could be called a born writer
has filled out our writing aptitude teat we have not yet
discovered a single individual miraculously endowed by
nature with all the qualities that go to make up a uc-
cessful author

  one aspirant has interesting ideas-and a dull uninter-
esting style another has great creative imagination but ia
woefully weak on structure and technique a third has a
natural writing knack-yet lacks judgment and knowledge
of human behavior in each case success can come only
after the missing links have been forged in

  here then is the principal reason why so many promis-
ing writers fail to go ahead their talent ia one-sided-
incomplete it needs rounding out

learn to tcrite by writing

tvtewspaper institute training is baaed on journalism-contlnu-
ous writing-the aort of training that turns out more successful
writers than any other experience many of the authors of todays
best sellers are newspaper-trained men and women

  one advantage of our new york copy desk method is that it starts
you writing and keeps you writing in your own home on your own
time week by week you receive actual assignments just as if you
were right at work on  great metropolitan dally

   all your writing is individually corrected and criticized by teteran
writers with years of experience breaking in new authors they
will point out those fault of style struc-
ture or viewpoint that keep you from pro-
gressing at the same time they will give
you constructive suggestions for building up
nnd developing your natural aptitudes

in fact so stimulating is this associa-
tion that btudent-members often begin to
sell their work before they finish the course

we do not mean to insinuate that they sky-
rocket into the big money or become
prominent overnight most beginnings aro
mado with earnings of    or
more for material that takes little time to
write - stories articlps on business hob-
bles sports travels local and club activi-
ties etc-things that can easily be turned
out in leisure hours and often on the
impulse of the moment

turkey pie at the end this is part of a
definite drive to make turkeys part of the
year around dinner menu rather than just
a once or twice a year holiday feast it
should be good for the turkey business as a
whole and perhaps explains in part the re-
cent expansion of turkey raising as a special
farm enterprise

  turkeys can be raised successfully with
very simple equipment the capital outlay
required in starting may therefore be quite
modest but care in watching the birds and
cleanliness in raising them are o paramount
importance if you hope to build up disease-
free turkey flocks

  cleanliness means clean range clean
quarters clean feed and clean water avail-
able at all times in addition young turkeys
should be protected against dampness and
damp cold or stormy weather they can
stand a considerable amount of dry cold
however

breeding pens

  until a few years ago breeding flocks were
customarily permitted free range during the
breeding and laying season the practise was
wasteful costly in dollars and cents to the
producer because of the difficulty of finding
the birds nests and gathering the eggs daily
modern practise is to keep breeding flocks
in good-sized breeding pens enclosed by a
six-foot high hog-proof fence

  turkeys are not likely to fly over such a
fence because of the difficulty of resting on
the thin strand of top wire

  out in new mexico land of enchant-
ment more than half that states sizable
annual turkey output comes from colfax
county the turkey ranches center around
maxwell thirty miles south of the colorado
line

  maxwells population is less than five hun-
dred but it is a colorful historic old town
to the north is raton pass and towering
peaks of the sangre de cristo range ruts
made by the cumbersome covered wagons
which once traveled the old santa fe trail
are still discernible you can still view the
ruins of the clifton house an oldtime over-
night stop for stagecoaches and patronized
on occasion by billy the kid-between or
possibly on cattle rustling forays

glamour and enterprise

  most of the colfax county turkeys are
raised on irrigated farm lands of the max-
well irrigation district on one big turkey
ranch-just to show how the modern west
combines the old glamour with up-to-the-
minute enterprise-turkey poults arrive at
the spread by plane when they are from six
to twenty-four hours old nature has pro-
vided turkey poults with a yolk sac that
keeps the birds alive for the first eight hours

  after that it is up to the rancher to see
that the baby birds get well started on their
way to becoming lush fat marketable tur-
keys first job is to teach the poults to eat
each young poult must be given individual
lessons by dipping its tiny bill into water
and watching to see if it swallows the
process is repeated as a double check simi-
larly each little bill must be dipped into
starting mash to give the bird the no-how
of self-nourishment

 poults from three days to two weeks old
are especially susceptible to several devastat-
ing diseases and must be handled with extra
care to prevent excessive loss

alfalfa and grain

 after the turkeys have begun to grow up
they are-on the new mexico ranch in
question-grazed on alfalfa pasturage be-
ing moved to new ground each week later
the birds are finished off by supplementing
the alfalfa diet with grain to add the plump
poundage that puts profits in the turkey
raisers pocket

  more or less the same procedure barring
the ultra-modern plane delivery of the baby
turkeys is followed out on a close to three-
thousand acre ranch near deer lodge mon-
tana where raising is the spreads principal
enterprise

  the ranch raises some four thousand birds
a year specializing in quality turkeys for the
thanksgiving and christmas holiday trade
and selling its output mostly to class hotels
restaurants and high-grade meat markets in
such montana city centers as butte ana-
conda and deer lodge

 like the new mexico birds these mon-
tana turkeys are raised on alfalfa and grass
pastures then they are fattened on grain
and made ready for marketing early in no-
vember

 the same pattern is generally followed
throughout the western turkey ranching
states turkey ranching involves a lot of
hard work it is no get-rich-quick proposi-
tion and the business has its ups and downs
like any other agricultural endeavor but
raising turkeys in the west or elsewhere is
an interesting enterprise there is money
in it-if you know something about poultry

by w c tuttle

  when speedy smith is kidnaped by masked hombres and
  tombstone jones inherits a ranch to which he has no claim
  the two rollicking range sleuths are in for a bullet jamboree

chapter i	well ill tell yuh sighed the other

d i a	man it only goes up to a hundred and

oa gen s	thirty above zero i wondered how much

two men met in front of the polar	shed stand without blowin up so i lit

saloon in silver butte and one of	a match and held it under the bulb do

them said	yuh know what happened

   jist how hot is it tday by yore thee-	blew up

mometer jim	nope-dropped ten de-grees

a complete tombstone and speedy novel


exciting western

 jim keaton secretary of the associa-
 tion had wired them

tombstone jones

 tombstone jones and speedy smith
ame down from the depot carrying
their war-bags a freight-train brought
them in from the north dusty red-eyed
from the heat

  they dropped their warbags in front
of the polar saloon and sank down in
two rickety chairs

  tombstone was at least seven feet tall
in his high-heels and sombrero and with
a physique that any sand-hill crane
would love he had a long lean face
high cheekbones sad eyes and a wide
mouth

  tombstones hips were so narrow that
he often threatened to wear suspenders
on his gun-belt

  speedy smith was a small replica of
tombstone jones speedy was five feet
seven inches tall and after a long rainy
spell he might weigh about a hundred
pounds as far as physical appearances
were concerned they were just a pair of
drifting down-at-the-heel cowpokes
who hadnt been eating regularly as a
matter of fact they were employed by
the cattlemens association-range de-
tectives if you please-or not not or-
namental not smart not very durable to
look at but effective in their own dumb
ways tombstone could not read nor
write but he claimed to be the best dog-
goned single-handed liar that ever
reached for a saddle-horn and got his
hands full of grass

go to painted fork in pintado valley
stop advise caution stop will mail in-
structions

  those stops always bothered tomb-
stone well they were in silver butte
and their next move was to either buy a
pair of horses and saddles or take the
stage to painted fork

  it aint lookin at no broncs in this
kind of heat speedy said wearily
well take the stage it only runs at
night when its cool

  cool huh queried tombstone if
thats a fact ill betcha we dont git no
stage before january yuh mean-at
night when its kinda shady dont yuh
or does that blasted sun ever go down
its the hottest day i ever seen com-
plained speedy and added quickly
dont you even start to lie about the
heat yuhve seen

  when yuhve seen what yuhve seen
yuh dont have to lie speedy one time
me and shorty devine was pilotin six
mules packed with ninety percent dyna-
mite over the funeral range headin for
a big minin camp you talk about heat
im leadin the train and all to once i
seen that the dynamite was fryin out of
them boxes and runnin down over the
hides of them six mules fact is they
was soaked with the stuff we was trav-
elin awful rocky trails and you know
how pack-mules are alius strikin sparks
with their shoes

for a moment tombstone paused to
take a deep breath then went on
well sir i stopped the outfit and
yelled back to shorty he got past them
mules and i explained my fears shorty
weve got to stay right here until cold
weather i said all we need is one
spark in that there niter-glycerine and
they wont even find enough of us to fit
onto a pair of wings

  shorty jist grinned got off and
picked up the lead mules front foot yuh
know what every danged shoe had
melted off them six mules nothin left
to strike a spark we took that outfit
through all right there wasnt anythin
left in them boxes except sawdust but
they clipped them mules stuffed the
drill-holes with hair and went right
ahead breakin rock yeah its hot here
today but not like that
alias adam jones	

  you almost give me a chill said
speedy dryly

  a small bow-legged man came across
the street looked them over carefully
and sat down with them he had a long
mustache of rather a greenish-purple
shade and what hair showed around his
ears was about the same color

  im in my second childhood he said
done had my hair and mustache dyed
black yesterday and look how she come
out if a miracle dont happen im kill-
in me a barber originally a gray-and
look at me who ever seen green and
purple hair

  we did said tombstone soberly

yea-a-ah-kinda my hair used to be
black pink wouldnt be so bad even a
red aint uncommon-but green and pur-
ple

oclock see yuh then so-long

 andy bowers bow-legged his way
down the street

  why lie to the little feller speedy

feller yuhre goin t be sorry

  the jones are awful nice folks
speedy

  some day yuhre goin to be a nephew

  adam jones said speedy thought-
fully sounds like he might be the first
jones probly married eve

  were a awful old family speedy
we go back a long ways

speedy smith

  and never have a round-trip ticket
added speedy lets see if we can find
somethin cold to drink

  elmer potts deputy sheriff from
painted fork came to silver butte late
that afternoon elmer was short and
fat bow-legged as a barrel-stave and
with a none too happy outlook on life
elmer rode in a top-buggy and sat rather
sideways on the seat that was the rea-
son he didnt ride a horse rather favor-
ing a side-sitting position

  andy bowers the stage-driver met
and talked with elmer and then intro-
duced him to tombstone and speedy

  elmer tells me you two are headin
for painted fork remarked the deputy
as they leaned on the polar bar the
reason i said that is that im ridin back
after it cools off and one of yuh can ride
with me

  id be glad to do it elmer said
tombstone quickly which settled the
matter as far as speedy was concerned

  they sat down yuh seem to favorin
yourself a little when a-settin down
elmer andy-said 

  yeah sighed elmer i do last
night bein awful hot i slept in my
birthday suit that is i aimed to but
when i set down on the aidge of the bed
-i set mself on a black widder spider
did she bite yuh elmer asked
andy

  must of nodded elmer i aint
	exciting western

never knowed of one to pack a gun or a
knife

  didja go high elmer

  ten feet replied elmer soberly
ceilin hampered me

  the four of them ate supper together
elmer called tombstone adam in-
dicating that andy had told him what
tombstone had said about him being a
nephew of john adam jones speedy
went to the depot with andy to pick up
some freight and they were there when
a passenger train stopped

only one passenger descended a
rather fat young man well-tailored
wearing glasses he had four bags-ex-
pensive-looking too all marked haw
the young man seemed at a loss what to
do next the train pulled out speedy
went a little closer looking the young
man over

  i want my bags taken to the-er-
stage depot said this young man you
are the porter i presume

  names smith said speedy soberly
yuh mean-yuhre goin on the stage to
painted fork

  precisely my man i am harold ash-
ley wentworth

 yuh dont mean it exclaimed
speedy not actually

  why yes of course i am

 well can yuh imagine that
speedys amazement seemed genuine
but about my bags

  oh yeah the stage is behind the
depot loadin some stuff well dump
the valises into it there cmon

  speedy took two and after a moment
of indecision the young man took the
other two andy roping some boxes on
the boot took time off to consider har-
old ashley wentworth

  hes a-goin to painted fork with us
andy said speedy

 do yuh want to ride with me
speedy asked andy

  im ridin inside declared speedy
the last time i rode on the drivers seat
somebody shot at me and i fell off any-
way im about half-out of sleep and ill
git me some on the way

  you jist think yuh will andy
grinned you aint never been over the
road to painted fork

  tombstone and elmer were still in
town when the stage pulled out harold
ashley wentworth was not at all com-
municative the old stage lurched and

bumped over the moonlit road every
bolt and joint in the old body protesting
harold ashley wentworth managed to
exclaim this is terrible

  what is asked speedy

  this stage

  the stage is all right-its the road
harold subsided on a smoother
stretch of road speedy asked

  are you a drummer

  why i-i really do not get the con-
nection sir by the way i forgot to pay
you for handling my bags here is a
quarter

  harold reached over just as they hit
a wicked succession of ruts and landed
on top of speedy somewhere in the
shuffle the quarter was lost

 much obliged wheezed speedy
when you give anythin you shore put
everythin yuh-ve got behind it

  there was no more attempts at con-
versation the road narrowed down
around a grade and andy was obliged
to drive slowly speedy dozed off to
sleep only to be awakened when the
fast-moving stage came to an abrupt
halt but this time he landed on harold
the door was yanked open

 come out of there you two-and
keep yore hands up a voice said
sharply

  they came out with speedy in front
the stage had been halted on a grade

  hightail it driver and dont look
back a voice snapped

  the stage rolled on down the grade
a masked man confronted the half-
asleep speedy and harold ashley went-
worth speedys gun was in his war-bag
on top of the stage the moonlight was
not too bright

  all right you two the man said
keep em up

  well do somethin will yuh com-
plained speedy id hate to grow up
lookin like a josh palm

 the masked man quickly searched
them for weapons they had none

  ill lead yuh he said you better
foller cause theres a gun behind yuh
cmon speedy glanced over his shoul-
der it was true another masked man
had stolen up behind them

  my heavens what will happen ex-
claimed harold weakly

  that depends on you feller replied
the man behind them get goin
their leader took them up through a
wide crevice in the rocks where they
 tombstone helped with
 the pulling speedy
 grabbed hold of the
 tall and they snaked
 the bawling cow out of
 the pit




 struck an old cattle-trail

 somebody has shore gone silly
speedy said

 well judge that growled the
leader

        chapter ii
        wrong victim

bout a mile further
along the old trail
they turned into a
swale which took
them to a small pole
shack from its ap-
pearance it might
have been a line camp
for some cow outfit
another masked man
was waiting for them
tied to a small hitch-
rack were three sad-
dled horses

 they herded their captives into the
shack and sat them down on a pole bunk
two tallow candles stuck into the necks
of whisky bottles furnished the illumi-
nation

  you aint tryin to scare us are yuh
 asked speedy

 the man at the shack evidently the
leader looked them over quietly and
shook his head he pointed at harold

 whered he come from he asked

 there was jist two of em on the
stage replied one of the men you said
to bring em both

  thats right

 suddenly he pointed his finger at
speedy

  yuhre jones eh he said

 speedy laughed at him masks and
guns didnt frighten speedy

  this must be funny to you snarled
the man exasperated at the attitude of
speedy

 thats right said speedy my
names smith

  it is eh wheres jones

  go ahead and make a lot of guesses
and theyll all be wrong

 the man turned to harold wheres
the mans pardner he asked

  i have no idea sir replied harold
perhaps he is the man who drove the
stage team

  the leader cursed their luck one of
the men had a bottle and they each took
a drink

  well said the leader all we can do

is kick these two off the mesa and call
it a day

  and that kicking was not a figure of
speech they took speedy and harold
outside one of the men pointed the di-
rection they wanted them to go

  it aint over eight nine miles to
painted fork right that way he said
if yuh dont break yore fool necks in
canyons you ought to git there in time
for breakfast let em have it boys
the boys did just that speedy smith
had never been kicked that hard before
in his life he was sure his vertebrae was
shortened several inches they didnt
go very fast because they couldnt get
up any speed but they kept going the
three men laughed and went back into
the shack speedy stopped and because
he was in front harold stopped too

  i aint a hair-pin yuh can bend up
thataway speedy said cmon

 they went back to the shack the
three men were having another drink
speedy helped harold into a saddle-end
gave him the reins he cut one horse
loose moving it away carefully after
taking the lariat-rope off the saddle
quickly he looped two ropes together
tiptoed forward hung the loop around
about six pole-ends on the corner of the
cabin and came back getting quickly
into the saddle

  have you ever been on a horse be-
fore he whispered to harold

  two whispered harold ive fallen
off twice

 the third times a charm said
speedy boot that rat-tail down that-
away and keep goin ill be right behind
yuh lets go

  harold obeyed orders and managed
to stay on the saddle the clatter of
hoofs shocked the occupants of the
shack into inactivity for the moment
and speedy spurred past the shack tak-
ing up the slack in that rope the shock
was considerable and both horse and
saddle buckled under the strain but the
poles pulled loose

  then speedy shook off the dally and
spurred after harold he had pulled
enough poles loose to make that shack
forever of the lean-to type and let in
the sod-covered roof

 he caught harold who was having
horse trouble the horse was broke to
neck-rein and harold was trying to turn
him by sagging back on one rein the
result was complete disagreement be-

exciting western
alias adam jones	

tween them harold was also frightened
over the prospect of the masked men
catching them

  we should have obeyed their orders
panted harold as they swung down onto
the main road they-theyll hate us
some men are that way agreed
speedy yuh cant satisfy em but we
wont worry about that compadre you
hang onto that horn and well go to
painted fork where the law can save
us

  i am a little sore complained har-
old one of those brutes kicked me aw-
ful hard

  did huh grunted speedy well
if the back of yore lap is any sorer than
mine i pity yuh

the appearance of the stage sans
passengers meant nothing until
andy bowers told of the holdup and the
kidnaping of his two passengers it was
only a few minutes later when tomb-
stone and elmer potts arrived in their
buggy and buck lorimer the sheriff
was trying to find enough men to make
up a posse tombstone was puzzled he
had never seen harold ashley went-
worth

  i dunno who he is but i think hes a
dummer andy said smelled like one
anyway and he was shore duded up
whyd anybody kidnap a drummer
asked one of the men

  men do funny things said tomb-
stone i knowed a feller who collected
cattle brands said it was his hobby
they hung him one day

  for collectin cattle brands asked
a man curiously

  yea-a-ah forgot to take it off the
cow

  you dont seem worried about yore
pardner said the sheriff

  no-o-o-o drawled tombstone he
aint the kind theyll be happy with
probly pay him somethin to go away
and mind his own business

  but weve got to find the other fel-
ler said elmer

  waitll they get rid of speedy sug-
gested tombstone mebbe hell bring
the other feller back with him

  about an hour later speedy and har-
old walked into the one hotel in painted
fork harold was not as immaculate as
he was when he got off the train at sil-
ver butte he had lost his hat and
limped a little tombstone was leaning

across the little hotel desk talking with
the proprietor when they came in

 where yuh been all this time
speedy tombstone asked

  oh we aint so awful late replied
speedy a couple of fellers had a prop-
osition to put up to us but when they
found out my name was smith they
wouldnt do business dont like smiths
did yuh git us a room

  uh-huh

  the old hotelkeeper peered over his
glasses at harold ashley wentworth

 did you want a room too young
man he asked

  i do replied harold stiffly i want
one with a bathtub large enough to cover
my aching muscles with hot water
we aint ever had none said the
man in the day time yuh can get a
bath at the barbershop but its night
now

  harold looked long and earnestly at
the hotelkeeper

  a hotel-and no bath he asked i
have never seen-

  people come here to sleep-not cause
theyre dirty

  harold leaned wearily on the desk
very well then he sighed i would
like your best suite

  my best what

  harold said speedy you jist better
take a room

  i-i believe i shall i have never
been-well i have always lived in a
city when in rome one must do as the
romans do i suppose

  number six is empty said the hotel-
keeper yuh dont need no key go
right up if there aint no water in the
pitcher yuh can go down the back steps
to the pump

yes i-well certainly thank you
harold limped up the steps elmer
potts and buck lorimer came into the
hotel and elmer chuckled at sight of
speedy

  where-at is the other feller asked
elmer

  gone upstairs to bed

  elmer introduced the sheriff a big
lanky person with a long hollow-
cheeked face and a murderous mustache
he wanted to know what happened

 well there was two masked men
sheriff speedy said they got us off
the stage and herded us back to a shack
in the hills where another man was
waitin for us he looked us over and
	exciting

said we wasnt the ones he wanted

  the sheriff studied speedys explana-
tion for a while andy told me where
it happened he said finally they
herded yuh-how far

  oh mebbe a mile

  yeah that still leaves yuh nine ten
miles from here how come yuh made
such good time

  they let us have their horses

 they let yuh-huh they let yuh
have-their horses eh

  oh yes they said sorry to discom-
mode yuh thisaway you take the horses
to town tie up the reins and turn em
loose theyll come home 

slowly the sheriff cuffed his big
hat over his left ear and scratched
his head it didnt sound plausible

  its got me beat he said quietly
well im glad it wasnt serious who
is the feller who was with yuh
harold ashley wentworth

  they didnt want him either eh
you aint ever seen harold have
yuh asked speedy

  not yet

 when yuh do yuhll know blamed
well they didnt

  well im glad everythin turned out
all right said the sheriff see yuh
later

  lets go up to the room and set down
its too hot to sleep tombstone said

  speedy shuddered a little set down
he asked wearily pardner you dont
know what yuhre askin but come on
the room was like an oven both win-
dows were open but there was not a
breath of air stirring speedy told
tombstone all about the kidnaping
and how they got back to town not omit-
ting the kick they had at parting

 they wanted a man named jones
huh queried tombstone sa-a-ay
do yuh reckon they meant me

 they wanted my pardner-named
jones

 and they had on masks eh maybe
its a lodge they wanted me to join
yea-a-ah said speedy wearily the
mystic knights of what happened to
jones

 adam jones added tombstone so-
berly

 sometime somewhere sighed
speedy yuhre goin to claim an uncle
and get both of us killed-and i hope
this aint it

western

chapter iii
range thefts

ainted fork was

no metropolis and by
the light of day it
showed the effects of
heat and sand the
main street was nar-
row crooked most of
the buildings of the
false-front variety
the street was dusty
lined with hitch-
racks and with not a
tree in sight the
mexican border was
only forty miles away and many of the
dwelling houses in the town showed a
mexican influence in architecture

  elmer potts joined them at breakfast
and over their ham and eggs elmer told
them about painted fork and its trou-
bles

  if yuhre adam jones youll like to
know all this he said

  tombstone choked on a piece of ham
nodded wiped the tears out of his eyes
and signaled elmer to go ahead

  yore uncle is dead said elmer so-
berly he was shot dead over a week
ago jack neil is in jail charged with
the murder jack aint john adam jones
nephew but hes johns cousins son

  pore uncle john said tombstone
huskily it wasnt emotion it was ham
in his wind-pipe

  yuh see nobody exactly cared for
john adam jones except mebbe it was
marion evans continued elmer her
pa worked for jones but got killed a
couple years ago by a bad horse ol
john wanted her to stay right there at
the ranch-which she done shes as
pretty as a red saddle-and shes in love
with johnny neil

  in love with the man who killed john
adam jones asked speedy

  thats right johnny has got a little
spread out in the pintados where he
raises a few cows him and  john
aint never been compadres in fact ol
john didnt like him a-tall one day he
tells johnny that he ort to eat some of
his own beef so he can find out what it
tastes like that insinuates that johnny
slick-ears his meat it makes johnny
sore and he says to ol john why you
ol polecat if you ever come onto my
alias adam jones

if

spread ill ventilate yore old hide
and he done jist that sighed elmer
we found ol john jist inside the main
gate to johnnys little place shot to
death

 he thought johnny was bluffin
huh asked tombstone

  well if he did he found out better
that left the bar j without no owner
sil kerr and ike bradley bein awful
human agrees to stay and run the place
without salary until things get fixed up
theyve been there over a year course
sody white the cook is still there no-
body to pay salaries nobody to say
whats what

  well didnt jones leave no will
said speedy soberly

  no he didnt speedy his closest
relation is adam jones at least thats
what the lawyer says natural-like if
yuhre adam jones you get the bar j
if the law says so you are aint yuh
im holdin up on the answer elmer
said tombstone soberly im pretty
well fixed as yuh might say and i aint
just shore that i want to tie mself down
in a place like this dont say nothin
until i make up my mind

  yuh see asked speedy as they went
back to the hotel claimin somethin
might not be so good sa-a-ay that
kinda clears up things somebody dont
want adam jones around here its a
good thing you wasnt on that stage last
night

  yea-a-ah breathed tombstone by
golly im a marked man i wonder if
anybody around here ever seen adam
jones i may have to prove myself a
alibi

  yuhre goin to lie both of us into our
graves sighed speedy

 they found harold ashley went-
worth at the hotel harold was not hap-
py he wasnt able to sleep because of
the heat and he was stiff and sore from
what had happened to him

  i am a fool he told them seriously
i should never have come down here
and i know i shall never forget last
night masked men with guns

 and boots added speedy why
did yuh come here harold

  some time ago i read a book dealing
with the customs of the west said har-
old in it was a paragraph which said
that it was very bad form ever to ask a
stranger his name why he came and in
what business was he interested

all right the masked man said to speedy and
wentworth keep yore hands up and do jut what
i tell yuh
	exciting

  thats right declared tombstone
you learned quite a lot about the west
ill betcha books will learn yuh a lot
of things

  harold grinned did you say books
or boots

  they went out and sat on the porch
where it was even warmer than inside
the hotel a girl drove up in a buck-
board deftly tied the half-broken pair
of broncs to a hitch-rack and went into
a store

  as big as a pint of gin and as handy
as a button on a shirt remarked speedy
admiringly and added pretty too

closing one eye tombstone
squinted at the near horse bar j
he said mebbe thats marion evans
speedy

  yea-a-ah thats right huh
thinkin it over remarked tomb-
stone i may take over the bar j after
all

  the bar j queried harold is that
a cattle ranch

  yeah tombstone nodded its the
property owned by my late lamented un-
cle john adam jones

  is that so did he die

  and so tombstone proceeded to tell
harold ashley wentworth all about the
troubles of john adam jones and john-
ny neil

 what is the ranch worth asked
harold

  i aint made no appraisal yet replied
tombstone soberly itll probly run in-
to the millions

 and mused harold john adam
jones died intestate

  i didnt hear about that said tomb-
stone mebbe he did

 the hotelkeeper gave tombstone a
letter speedy took it and read it care-
fully it was from jim keaton secretary
of the cattlemens association the let-
ter said

  get in touchwith thomas grimes attorney
at law and he will tell you what he wants
done

  this letter was sent in a plain enve-
lope thomas grimes had the only gold-
lettered sign in painted fork he was
also a stock broker handled insurance
and real estate grimes was a little
gray-haired person with some badly-
fitted uppers which caused him to whis-
tle when he talked fast he took one

western

look at the letter from jim keaton
sagged back in his chair and looked them
over

  i asked jim keaton for one man
he said

  we come in sets of two said speedy
soberly

  i see i heard about you two being
in town so you speaking to tomb-
stone are adam jones nephew of john
adam jones eh

  tombstone relaxed his long legs and
began rolling a cigarette

  what do you think he countered
what could i think adam jones
has been dead four years

  tombstone never changed expression
he finished the cigarette and reached for
a match

  must be the wrong jones speedy
said seriously on a clear day yuh can
hear this ones heart beat

  whats in a name asked tomb-
stone my name is really jones

  the lawyer smiled slowly suppose
we keep on using adam too

  you said adam was dead

  listen said the lawyer soberly if
you are working for jim keaton you
cant be as dumb as you act youve
heard about the murder of john adam
jones i suppose you know that johnny
neil is in jail charged with that murder
perhaps you know that john adam
jones left no will i was his lawyer-
and he wouldnt write a will in fact he
wouldnt do anything anyone wanted
him to do

  i do know that john had a nephew
named adam outside of adam the only
living relative he had is johnny neil the
son of a cousin of john johnny is a
fine boy even if they do say he murdered
his uncle as i told you adam jones is
dead john knew it i said to him

   you know that johnny neil is your
only living relative so why dont you
will him the bar j he said because
i dont like that wild-eyed young devil
-and its none of your business after
john was killed cort haden owner of
the lazy h comes out with a note for
fifteen thousand against the bar j bor-
rowed money cort says

  if they hang johnny neil cort ha-
den will probably get the whole bar j
for the fifteen thousand dollars and i
dont believe johnny has a ghost of a
chance with a pintado valley jury
thats the story boys
alias adam jones

  tombstone jones blew a smoke-ring
shoved a bony forefinger through it and
looked up at the lawyer

  whats our job he asked

  as adam jones i believe i can get
you installed at the bar j where you
can protect your interests-the interests
of adam jones at least we can block
cort hadens move to have the court
give him charge of the ranch in order to
protect his note

  you dont like haden said speedy
soberly i can see that

  i do not replied grimes firmly i
dont want him out there i dont believe
johnny neil killed john jones but no-
body else seems interested in whether
he did or didnt buck lorimer is satis-
fied that he did so he wont do anything
to prove otherwise

  about that girl out there queried
tombstone

grimes expression grew thought-
ful he nodded

  marion evans said the lawyer quiet-
ly i saw her grow up from a baby i
knew her mother and father maybe im
just a bit sentimental over that girl
shes only eighteen and she hasnt any
other home as a matter of fact i dont
want cort haden and his gang out there
if we can tie this thing up long enough-
maybe we can prove something in john-
nys favor

  we aint worked on nothin much
except rustlin deals said speedy i
dunno how much good wed be at this
kind of stuff

  didnt jim keaton tell you anything
except that letter

  no he didnt

  that is why he sent you down here
said grimes the bar j has been stolen
blind im not sure there is enough cows
left to cover that haden note john
adam jones was an old man too old to
do much of his own work he didnt
ride much any more i dont mind telling
you boys that folks didnt like john
adam jones

  but theyd hang johnny neil for
killin him said tombstone

  they would declared the lawyer
and they surely will if we cant do
something about it you go out to the
ranch and take over there are only
three men out there kerr and bradley
two very good cowboys and sody white
the cook kerr and bradley have been



there only a year or more but white has
been there for years ill fix this up with
the judge and then go out with you
just remember that you are adam
jones

  why didnt sheriff lorimer stop the
rustlin asked speedy

  buck lorimer said briggs soberly
couldnt stop a grandfathers clock if
he had hold of the pendulum with both
hands

  heres another thing said tomb-
stone mebbe you heard about the stage
bein held up and the kidnapin of
speedy and this here harold ashley
wentworth	

  why yes i heard something about
it but not in detail

  they thought they was gettin adam
jones said speedy

  thomas grimes rubbed his chin his
eyes speculative they thought one of
you was adam jones hm-m-m-m that
is rather odd how would they even
guess a thing like that

 in silver butte said speedy
tombstone told andy bowers that he
was adam jones-and andy advertised
him plenty

 i see-e-e hm-m-m-m somebody
didnt want adam jones to come down
here well well are you frightened
over it tombstone

  ive done shook so much that every
tooth in my head is loose

  i see the lawyer smiled i won-
dered what it was that was rattling
that said speedy soberly was my
knees

chapter iv

two warnings

the afternoon
they went out to the
bar j all three of
them riding in
thomas grimes bug-
gy grimes intro-
duced them to mari-
on evans and told
her that adam jones
was taking charge of
the ranch until all le-
gal matters were
straightened out so-
dy white the old
cook shook hands gravely and without
any comments sil kerr and ike brad-
	exciting

ley merely nodded kerr was a big
square-jawed cowpuncher while ike
bradley was a half-pint with a crooked
nose and buck-teeth

 the two cowboys went back to their
work at the corral sody went back to
the kitchen and the lawyer headed for
painted fork marion took tombstone
and speedy to the room formerly oc-
cupied by john adam jones and they
dumped their war-bags there was a
framed crayon picture of john jones on
the wall it was a life-sized head made
from a photograph in which john was
staring squarely at the lenses tomb-
stone looked it over from every angle
shuddered a little and took it off the
wall

  i dont mind lyin about bein his
nephew but i dont want that old peli-
cano glarin at me all the time said
tombstone he aint taken his eyes off
me since i came in here

  well he aint purty to look at said
speedy mebbe itll be a relief to him
too yuh cant tell

 they went out on the porch where
marion was sewing she did not look
up

  i suppose you will want me to move
cut she said

 why asked speedy

  well after all if this ranch belongs
to mr jones

  that said tombstone quickly aint
been settled maam

  the girl smiled slowly it is funny
to be called maam she said everyone
calls me marion

 thats a awful pretty name said
tombstone one time i had a pinto
horse and i-

  we aint talkin about horses inter-
rupted speedy

  was the pinto named marion asked
the girl

  tombstone grinned  course not it
was a he horse

  the girl laughed and they all felt
more at ease

  marion what sort of a hair-pin is this
grimes person speedy said

  hes fine she declared just fine
ive known him all my life

  he was john jones lawyer eh

  yes he was speedy mr jones was
mighty fine to me except-well he
didnt like johnny neil you dont know
johnny of course

 no maam-marion said tomb-

western

stone we never met him-yet

  they say he killed his uncle she
said quietly i know he didnt mr
grimes dont think he did but i guess
that everybody else thinks he did do
you think he did

  were awful new here said speedy

 course if you say he didnt well back
yuh

  im glad she said but without any
enthusiasm

  bein glad kind of helps out said
tombstone what do bradley and kerr
think about it marion

  they dont say much of course they
are very loyal to mr jones in fact they
offered to work here for nothing until
this is settled by the court

  sody white came out on the porch
wearing a new flour-sack apron marion
went into the house so sody sat down 
he was an old rawhider who had ridden
the ranges until his rheumatism grew up

  so yuhre adam jones eh he said
you favor the jones fambly

  in what way asked speedy

  two arms and two laigs replied
sody soberly

  most of us are born thataway said
tombstone sody he said soberly if
im goin to have this here bar j wished
upon me id like to get yore version of
this rustlin were sufferin from

  sufferin is right nodded sody as
he filled his pipe were bein robbed-
plenty oh not big bunches but a reg-
ular dreen we aint had a chunk of veal
since settin bull stood up

  young stuff all gone eh

  uh-huh john was gettin too old to
ride much eyesight wasnt as good as
it used to be left it to the boys ill say
theyve worked hard tryin to trap them
rustlers but it aint no use the sheriff
done what he could but yuh cant do
much lessn youve got a idea to work
on

 its a awful chore tombstone
nodded what about this fifteen thou-
sand dollars he owed cort haden of the
lazy h

sody shook his head sadly i dunno
anythin about that he said they
traded in draw-poker mostly john
prided his fool self on his poker-playin
ability sometimes hed go over to the
lazy h and him and cort haden would
play two-handed draw sky-limit and no
holds barred four five months ago
alias adam jones	

john said to me sody one of these
nights im cornin home with the lazy
h in my pocket but he didnt-and
after that he didnt go over there no
more mebbe cort took him for the fif-
teen thousand dollars-i dunno

  sounds plausible nodded tomb-
stone roulette is my game

  it ort to be said speedy dryly
youve paid for it

  tombstone and speedy ate with sil
kerr and ike bradley the two cow-
boys talked very little and after supper
they went to town tombstone said to
speedy

  im just scared that the boys resent
us

  they were in the main room talking
with marion when a horse and buggy
drew up at the front of the house it was
harold ashley wentworth and deputy
sheriff elmer potts

  harold has got hisself a scare so he
hired me to bring him out here elmer
explained

  what scared yuh harold asked
tombstone curiously

  harold didnt say-he just handed
tombstone a piece of soiled paper
which tombstone handed to speedy on
it was pencilled in large crudely-drawn
letters

if you want to live-

hit the grit

snoopers aint welcome here

  speedy read it aloud

  i am not a snooper harold said
harolds glasses were askew and his hair
touseled he looked at marion forgot
his fears long enough to smile

  harold id like to have yuh meet
marion speedy said

this is indeed a pleasure miss mar-

ion said harold i hope you will ex-
cuse my appearance but i am a bit up-
set

  where-at did yuh get this billy-doo
harold asked tombstone 

  it was in an envelope left at the ho-
tel no one knows who left it i-i am
sure i havent snooped

  the deputy sheriff eyed harold for
several moments why would anybody
threaten him he said wonderingly

  and how on earth does one hit the
grit asked harold

 vamoso prontosaid tombstone
gesturing vaguely rattle yore hocks
spurn the brush light a shuck et cet-
tery

  he means pull out fast explained
elmer

  go hither from hence speedy
grinned in plain english harold
theyre orderin yuh out of the country
-fast

  but my goodness i dont want to go
away speedy what would you do if
someone sent you a note like that
have you propounded speedy so-
berly ever seen a scared smith
harold grinned slowly and shook his
head i never have he said

  and whats more yuh wont harold
do you mean that a smith never gets
frightened

  no i dont mean that at all you
never see a scared smith cause theyd
be goin so fast yuh cant see em just
a blur thats all

  harold started to grin swallowed
painfully i really do not know which
way to run he said

  wont you sit down asked marion
im sure you are safe here

  thank you very much-my legs are

turn page

tops for

qualm

a
	excitin

a little weak you see i asked mr potts
to bring me out here because i seemed
to feel that i-well i felt it might be a
safer place than town

  well ill be headin back to town
said elmer youll be all right here
harold-i hope ill tell johnny i saw
yuh marion

 thank you elmer come out when
you can

  after elmer left harold said

  im sorry miss marion i-i dont
want to be a bother perhaps i should
go back to town

  it is no bother she said ill merely
fix another bed you cant go back there
because you never know what might
happen

  marion went to prepare the extra bed
and harold said

  isnt she wonderful

  there was an extra bed in the room
assigned to tombstone and speedy and
marion brought the bedding the door
was open harold went over to the door-
way and watched her make the bed she
saw the picture of john adam jones
leaning against the wall and she noticed
the discolored spot on the wall where it
had hung for so long

  tombstone walked over to the door-
way beside harold and saw her hang the
picture again

  is that the portrait of john adam
jones miss marion harold said

  yes she said not such a good
likeness though

  dontcha think so queried tomb-
stone why i think its-

  crash splintered glass flew all over
the main room and a bullet tugged at
the lobe of harolds left ear

before any one could move an-
other bullet cut splinters off the
door casing then speedy hit the lamp
with a chair-cushion and the place was
plunged in darkness except for what
light came from the bedroom where the
lamp was out of line with the doorway

  tombstone had kicked harolds feet
from under him and went crawling to-
ward the smashed front window trying
to locate the shooters marion had
dropped down behind the bed sody was
in the doorway to the kitchen

  anybody killed he yelled what
happened cantcha talk

  tombstone had discovered that each
window was equipped with a shade and

western

was crawling around yanking them
down

  we aint got a lick of sense he com-
plained settin here with the winders
uncovered after bein warned aint a
brain among us

  ill fetch another lamp offered
sody got one right here

  harold was rather white as he leaned
against the wall and fingered the lobe of
his left ear that forty-five bullet had
given it a very decided flip marion was
a bit white too tombstone looked into
the bedroom and turned around after
a quick inspection

 uncle john adam jones is down
he said quietly hit twice

  the two bullets had ruined the crayon-
made features of the former owner of
the bar j but the piercing eyes still
looked fiercely straight ahead

  wh-why would anybody sh-shoot his
picture harold said huskily

  tombstone and speedy looked at each
other perhaps it was rather amazing to
find a man that dumb

 probly somebody who dont know
the old man is dead speedy said

  they almost shot my ear off said
harold soberly you see i-i have
never been that close to death before in
my life

why dont some of yuh go out and
salivate them drygulchers asked sody
peevishly all yuh do is talk about it
do yuh reckon theyre waitin for us
sody asked tombstone

  well no i dont reckon so huh
who was they shootin at-you or the
dude

  heavens gasped harold you dont
mean they deliberately shot at me
they told yuh to hit the grit didnt
they asked speedy

  why yes but-well dont you think
they are rather impetuous

  tombstone grinned yeah i reckon
so marion are you scared

  marion nodded her lips tight

  i should have stayed in town harold
said miserably

  you are staying right here young
man she said firmly just remember
that lightning doesnt strike twice in the
same place

  harold ashley wentworth felt of his
left ear i hope not he said earnestly

  well keep that picture down sos
they wont have any inducement tomb-
stone said
alias adam jones



chapter v

very little but was
cheerful about it

breakfast

  adam how come they nicknamed yuh

stone ive alius made it a point to buy
a suitable tombstone for every man i

tims in a unmarked grave

  i think its quaint said sody
yea-a-ah said tombstone its cost
me a lot of money one time i got me
into a real bad scrap and i had to buy

  not all at once harold-i had to
empty my six-gun im shore glad i

stones shore run into money

  cort haden owner of the lazy h and
one of his cowpunchers rode out that
morning haden was a rather tall good
looking cowman reputed fast with a gun
when haden and his cowboy arrived
tombstone was down at the stable
tombstone leaned lazily against the
doorway of the stable and watched
haden dismount near him

  yuhre jones eh queried haden
tombstone nodded

im cort haden owner of the lazy

h

  oh yeah said tombstone indiffer-
ently and waited for haden to continue
the conversation

  so yuhre old johns nephew eh

tion square in the eye you may be a long
time in gettin it

  dont worry ill collect it all right

  well said the owner of the lazy h
i just wanted yuh to know that when
yuh get through payin me what the bar
j owes me yuh wont have much left
the outlook is gloomy-for both of

  marion and harold came out on the big
porch

 cort haden looked up that way

body wrote him a warnin tellin him to

  yeah he found that out some side-
winder shot twice through a window last
evenin and almost got him

  cort haden looked closely at tomb-
stone who would shoot that dude
he asked

  i wish i could answer that replied
tombstone id give yuh the answer
and his scalp at the same time yuh see
he didnt miss me very far

  yeah huh who is this wentworth
jones whats he doin here

  tombstone grinned well i dunno

about him
	exciting

  it sounds like they are agreed ha-
den well weve got to be driftin glad
to have met yuh jones i wanted to let
yuh know how we stand

  nice of yuh im shore said tomb-
stone soberly drop in again

sil kerr and ike bradley came
down from the bunkhouse and hun-
kered down in the shade with tombstone

  we had a talk with grimes last night
and he said that you are in charge out
here and we take yore orders bradley
said

  and added kerr we want yuh to

erybody knows it nobody knows how

our best

  well thats all anybody can do i
reckon ill look into it myself soons
i get time

  thats good said bradley quietly
whats the dude doin here

  you ask him suggested tombstone
i did-and he told me it wasnt any of
my business

  somebody in town suggested that he
might be from the cattle association
said bradley

yuh mean-a cow detective aw
shucks they aint that hard up are they
that fellers too dumb to be a detective
mebbe hes in disguise suggested
kerr

  if he is hes shore a wonder tomb-
stone said hes fooled me ill tell yuh
that

  are you hard to fool asked brad-
ley

  i reckon i must be i aint never been
fooled yet

  kerr and bradley rode away intend-
ing to move some cattle from an almost-
dry water hole tombstone went back to
the house where marion and harold
were talking

  do the boys seem satisfied with their
new boss marion said

western

 tombstone grinned slowly well
they didnt say i reckon they know
more about whats to be done than i do
and they told me they were workin for
nothin

  that is true said marion they are
very loyal to the bar j

  one must be loyal to do that said
harold

  we had another cowboy for a while
said marion mr jones liked him very
much his name was dave morris but
he quit his job and went back to colo-
rado i never knew hed quit until after
mr jones was killed ike bradley said
hed gone back to colorado

  sody came out on the porch to smoke
his pipe

 i heard yuh talkin about dave
morris he said nice feller praised
my biscuits and he praised my beans
yuh know sody stared thoughtfully at
the bowl of his old pipe the mornin of
the day john jones was killed he sad-
dled a horse john didnt ride much any
more i said to him if yuhre goin to
town ill drive yuh in and he said im
goin to meet dave morris and i cant
use a buggy

 i dont know where he met dave
morris i told it to bradley and he said
why dave quit the night before the old
man was shot he was goin back to
colorado mebbe the old man met him
in painted fork to pay him off i didnt
say nothin but i dont think bradley
was right

  thats interestin said tombstone
mebbe morris shot the old man

  ive thought that over too but it
dont make sense him and dave was too
friendly and why on earth would he
kill john jones no it aint reasonable
but it kind of stuck in my craw-him
sayin that he was goin to meet dave
morris i dont guess well ever know
did yuh tell the sheriff asked
tombstone

  yeah i told him but he didnt make
nothin of it i told grimes the lawyer
but he said we couldnt do anythin un-
less we could find dave morris

 i wish we could find him said
marion it-it might help johnny
tombstone wandered back to the
stable and harold joined him

  that girl is wonderful declared
harold she told me all about her
romance with johnny neil i feel terri-
bly sorry for her why she hasnt any
alias adam jones



money no relatives no home she and
johnny were to have been married soon
they had planned their own home and
now it has all been ruined do you think
they will hang johnny

  folks around here think they will
harold

  but tombstone cant we get him out
of jail

tombstone stared at harold yuh
mean bust him out

could it be done asked harold
im scared not pardner dontcha
realize that johnny would have to take
to the tall hills and dodge the law all
his life

  i suppose he would no that wouldnt
work out but couldnt he get off with a
fine

  they dont have no cash fine for a
murder harold anyway if there was
itd be awful big and johnny aint got a
cent

  i have said harold simply

  you have pardner would you pay
his fine

  why not asked harold

  tombstone cuffed his big hat down
over one eye and blinked at harold

  yuh got me there pardner he said
quietly

speedy came down and joined them
im ridin to town speedy tomb-
stone said you look after the place
whats supposed to be on yore
mind asked speedy

  tombstone didnt say he selected a
tall roan gelding picked out the best
available saddle and rode away from the
ranch he was still thinking about dave
morris when he drew up at the sheriffs
office buck lorimer and elmer potts
were there talking with doctor ray the
coroner elmer introduced tombstone
to the doctor

  well well the doctor said so you
are adam jones johns nephew i must
say there is little resemblance

  jones do come in assorted sizes
shapes and colors admitted tombstone
im one of the long handsome ones im
glad to meet yuh doc yuh know theres
somethin i wanted to ask yuh was this
here uncle of mine killed with a six-gun
shotgun or a rifle

  he was killed with a forty-five re-
volver

  uh-huh killed instantly doc
  no i wouldnt say he was jones as

a matter of fact he was shot through the
back and possibly lived on hour i-i
dont believe the question ever came up
at the inquest or did it buck

  no i dont reckon it did replied the
sheriff tombstone smiled

  whats on yore mind tombstone
asked elmer

  just this replied tombstone you
fellers took it for granted that johnny
neil shot him because you found the
body at his place yuh never thought
that mebbe the old man rode a long ways
before he pitched off his horse

  buck scowled thoughtfully be hard
to prove he said slowly

  no harder than provin he didnt
what do you say doc

  well replied the doctor it is a pos-
sibility there is only one stumbling-
block to that theory jones-pintado
valley has made up its mind that johnny
is guilty if johnny neil didnt shoot
john jones who did

  you men knew a feller named dave
morris didnt yuh

  they stared at him finally the sheriff
said

  what about dave morris

  the day john adam jones was killed
he rode away from the bar j to meet
dave morris and it wasnt in painted
fork because when sody white offered
to take john to town in a buggy john
said he couldnt take a buggy where he
was meetin dave morris

  where did you get all that tomb-
stone

  from sody white the cook at the
bar j

  well thats funny he never told
us

  yuh never asked him did yuh

  no i never i couldnt go around
askin everybody

  i aint particular said tombstone
soberly

  but what became of dave morris
asked the sheriff

  i heard he went back to colorado
said elmer somebody told me but i
dunno who it was

  i heard that too said tombstone
but dave morris was in the valley the
day john jones was mudered and john
went to meet him

  no one had any comments

  hows the dude tombstone elmer
said

  fine a short time after you left last
exciting western



night somebody shot twice through a
front window at the ranch and almost
got him nicked his left ear and put two
bullets into a pitcher of john adam
jones

  are you jokin asked the sheriff
no and they wasnt either sheriff
i told yuh he got a warnin re-
minded the sheriff slowly

  id kind of like to meet johnny neil
said tombstone yuh see i aint never
seen him yet

  take him back to the cell elmer
said the sheriff better watch and see
that he dont give johnny a saw or some
dynamite

chapter vi

grim secret

ohnny neil was a
nice-looking young
cowboy but being
confined wasnt doing
him any good he
shook hands through
the bars with tomb-
stone

 elmer told me
about you taking over
the ranch he said
how is marion
shes finern frawg-
hair johnny did you
know dave morris

  why sure i knew dave what about
him

  when was the last time you saw
him

  johnny scowled thoughtfully the
last time why it was the day-the day
john jones was killed dave rode in at
my place alone i was saddlin up to go
back into the hills and he didnt stay
but a few minutes said he had to be
goin too

  did he say hed quit the bar j
johnny shook his head no he didnt
say anythin like that dave was a nice
feller he used to stop at my place and
have supper with me he was only with
the bar j a few months just between
me and you i always did think that dave
spent quite a lot of his time tryin to find
out who was rustlin bar j cows if hed
quit the bar j im sure hed have told
me and he was ridin a bar j horse
well thank yuh johnny said
tombstone see yuh later ill tell

marion i saw yuh and you was lookin
fine

  elmer and tombstone walked back to
the office the doctor was gone

  tombstone youve kind of made me
wonder about certain things buck lor-
imer the sheriff said

  elmer told the sheriff what johnny
neil had said about morris being at his
ranch the day of the murder

  why dont things like that come
out sheriff lorimer asked peevishly
he never told me that

  yuh didnt ask him did yuh que-
ried elmer soberly

  listen you wall-eyed-no i dont
reckon i did elmer it seems to me that
theres a lot of questions i didnt ask
well said tombstone soberly i
wouldnt advise yuh to ask too many
now buck yuh might find out a lot of
things and yuh might get loaded with
forty-five bullets too ill go back to the
bar j and see if i can find any more
answers

  id love to hear em said the sheriff
as tombstone stepped out on the side-
walk a man was running down towards
the office elmer came into the doorway
and looked up the street toward the run-
ning man

  whats wrong now he asked sharp-
ly-

  the man was panting heavily all out
of breath he managed to say

  its grimes the lawyer-beat up
he paused to get another breath mrs
allen who takes care of his house found
him somebody beat him bad maybe
hes dead get the doctor will yuh
tombstone went with them grimes
lived in a modest little cottage about
two blocks off the main street he lived
alone took his meals at a restaurant and
a mrs allen came at any time during
the day to keep his house in order the
lawyer was unconscious from a beating
on his head the dried blood indicated
that it had been done hours ago doctor
ray went right to work on him but re-
fused to say how badly he was hurt ex-
cept to mutter bad enough

  looks like the barrel end of a six-
gun said the sheriff he shore got a
pistol-whippin do yuh reckon hell be
abe to talk doc

  lucky if hes able to live
tombstone came back past the hotel
where a group of men were talking about
grimes and the hotelkeeper called to
alias adam jones	

him he went into the hotel and got an
unstamped letter which he handed to
the tall cowboy on the envelope was
penciled tombstones name

  one of the boys found it on the floor
explained the man

  tombstone thanked him and went on
to the bar j he couldnt read it but
he knew that it was not from a friend
speedy met him at the stable tombstone
told him about grimes and gave him the
letter it was crudely penciled in capital
letters and read

 we no who yuh are and you
aint got no rite at the bar j
git out of here at once or you
wont never leeve we meen bis-
ines git out or die

 it was unsigned speedy scowled
thoughtfully

  yuh know what he asked quietly
they beat the truth out of grimes
they made him talk were up against
a blind canyon tombstone

  does look kind of tough admitted
tombstone they shore petted pore
grimes on the head doc dont know if
hell live or not

 what are we goin to do asked
speedy

  i dont know pardner oh-oh here

somethin to talk about

the deputy dismounted quickly and
came over to them

  grimes was conscious for a few mo-
ments and he said tell tombstone
jones to look out-theyll kill him
potts said thats all he said

  elmer sat down and reached for the
makings of a cigarette

  that kind of news shore goose-pim-
ples me said speedy tombstone
handed elmer the note he got at the
hotel

  well great lovely dove snorted
elmer as he read it that sort of makes
it unanimous dont it

  elmer yuhre lookin at a awful sick
man said tombstone soberly

  well you aint goin to stay right
here and be killed are yuh

  im too sick to be moved

  uh-huh well i was hopin youd
run

 yuh was elmer why

  well yuh see elmer took a deep
breath and lighted his cigarette yuh

jones pulls out or the shootin is over
things like this are our business but
youll notice that he didnt come out to
help protect yuh

  i never thought id live to have a
bodyguard said tombstone

  disinterested folks would call him a
keeper said speedy

  well said elmer if yuh aint pull-
in out what are yuh goin to do tomb-
stone set here and get shot

  yuhre awful blunt in yore remarks
elmer cmon speedy were saddlin
up the three of us are goin to take a
ride

  what for asked elmer curiously
well elmer ill tell yuh said
tombstone soberly me and speedy
aint never seen much of pintado valley
and id hate to think i got killed in a
strange place

  is he crazy speedy asked elmer
speedy looked thoughtfully at tomb-
stone who was going into the stable and
replied

  elmer we aint heard from all the
precincts yet but on incomplete reports
hes shore runnin ahead

  johnny neils ranchhouse was small
unpretentious they stopped there and
elmer showed them where they found
the body of john adam jones then
they rode on into the hills where they
could look over the valley there was a
scattering of cattle in the hills all the
brands of the valley in evidence the
bar j lazy h circle s and the rafter a

  yuh cant alter the bar j into any of
the others tombstone said so they
aint alterin brands thats a cinch and
also if youll look close youll see that
no two of ems branded on the same spot
the bar j brands on the left hip the
lazy h on the right side the circle s
on the left side and the rafter a on the
right hip

  we figured that out quite a while
ago said elmer

 yuh did elmer queried tomb-
stone that took brains

  oh it took us quite a while but we
got it

  oh shore yuh cant do it all to once
they swung further back into the
broken hills and were working their way
down along the rim of a big washout
when tombstone drew up his head
lifted somewhere and close a cow was
exciting western



bawling weakly

  probiy fell into the washout and
cant get out said elmer

  they worked their way along until
the sound came from almost below them
here was a deep pot-hole probably
washed out by a big cloudburst years
ago tombstone crawled through the
brush where he could look down there
then he went back to the others and they
circled one end of it coming out into an
open space where there was no brush at
the rim

  down in the pot-hole was a big
spotted cow looking up at them on the
ground half concealed in weeds and low
brush was the body of a spotted calf
apparently the calf was dead

  ill betcha her calf fell in and she
went down after it speedy said you
can see where she slid down there but
the bank is too soft for her to get back
shell starve down there

  shes moren half starved right now
said tombstone

  he took two ropes and knotted them
together shook out the loop and hun-
kered down on the rim of the pot-hole
tombstone was an expert with a lariat
but this was a very difficult feat his
first cast landed on the rump of the starv-
ing cow but she paid little attention
time after time he flung that loop but
caught nothing

  his last cast hit the cow on the neck
and she lowered her head at the same
moment the loop twisted turned over
and tombstone almost fell over back-
wards taking up the slack the loop
was tight around her horns the cow
merely shook her head wearily

  all right grinned tombstone el-
mer you get yore horse and well haul
her out-maybe speedy you get that
other rope and well let you slide down
to her perhaps you can twist her tail
enough to git her to help a little

  you keep that rope tight warned
speedy i never trust a cow

elmer helped speedy go down on
the rope and then took a dally
around his saddle horn with the other
rope

  shes a bar j and i dont like the
look in her eye speedy called the
calf is dead whew shes been dead
quite a while too

  elmer swung his horse around so they
could take the cow up the best slope

she tried to hook speedy but the rope
prevented her he grabbed her tail and
yelled to elmer

  full speed ahead

  tombstone helped with the pulling
and they snaked that poor cow up over
the bank cow bawling dust flying she
didnt try to get up elmer slacked the
rope and tombstone took it off her
horns then she rolled over and slowly
got to her feet they watched her shake
her head a few times taking out the
kinks and then she went down the hill
walking slowly speedy was yelling at
them to throw him that rope so they
went back to the rim speedy was part-
way back trying to get a foot-hold

  whats yore hurry tombstone
yelled down at him

  speedys foot slipped and he slid back
clawing at the dirt

  git me out of here he yelled
theres a dead man down here

  are you sure asked elmer speedy
looked up at him an agonized expression
showing through the dust

  i-i stepped on him yelled speedy
gimme that rope

  tombstone tied off the double rope to
an old snag and he and elmer went down
into the pot-hole the man was dead all
right almost buried in the low brush and
weeds he had been dead quite a while
too elmer took a good look at him
opened and closed his own mouth several
times

  th-thats dud-dave morris he fi-
nally blurted whats left of him
shot right through the head too
said tombstone examining the skull

  what next asked elmer helplessly
im gettin goosepimples

  tombstone turned the dead calf over
on its right side was the newly-burned
brand of the lazy h the three men
looked at it and at each other the calfs
mother marked almost exactly like the
calf bore the old mark of the bar j

  that calf was shot said tombstone
pointing at the bullet hole in its head

  lets get out of here and find the
sheriff exclaimed elmer

  with the aid of the rope they were
able to get back to the rim elmer was
all excited

  weve got the deadwood on cort ha-
den and his bunch he exclaimed
theyre stealin bar j calves

  wait a minute said tombstone
we cant prove it mebbe we cant find
alias adam jones

the old cow that calf dont prove any-
thin elmer weve got a dead man and
its more important to find out who shot
him

  yuh mean-dont say nothin about
the cow and calf

  i reckon thatd be the best thing to
do it dont alius do to tell everythin
yuh know tell buck lorimer that we
seen buzzards over there and investi-
gated

chapter vii

scent of perfume

oiling their ropes
they climbed into the
saddle and headed for
painted fork ike
bradley and sil kerr
were riding into
painted fork as the
three men came in
tombstone reined
over to meet them at
a hitching post and
told them about find-
ing the body of mor-
ris

  they were both surprised and indig-
nant questioning tombstone closely as
to where the body was found tombstone
said quietly

  you boys range-brand all the bar j
calves dont yuh

  we sure do replied bradley

  not all of em said tombstone
somebody else is helpin yuh we found
a sample today dont say a word about
it well lay a trap and get the whole
bunch

  aint yuh tellin the sheriff asked
kerr anxiously

  nope ill handle this deal

  it didnt require much time for the
sheriff to get the coroner an extra horse
for packing the body back and plenty
equipment to get into and out of the pot-
hole tombstone and speedy went with
them and it was dark before they got
back to painted fork buck lorimer
saw the dead calf but paid no attention
to it in fact he didnt even note that
the little animal had been shot

  even elmer noticed this on the way
back he smiled at tombstone

  if yuh want buck to discover some-
thin write it out and mail it to him
elmer said



  they ate supper in painted fork that
evening sitting with their backs against
a wall and where they could face the
door and windows everyone was talk-
ing about the murder of dave morris
but no one except the three men who
made the discovery knew about the mis-
branded calf

  thomas grimes the attorney was still
unconscious but had been conscious long
enough to tell the doctor that he did not
know who assaulted him he wanted to
know if tombstone jones was still alive

  they met the sheriff after supper and
he stopped tombstone

  i reckon its time for me to get
straight on this deal what is grimes
interest in you and why was he beaten
up like that whats the idea of anyone
warnin you two and how did you three
happen to find the body of dave morris
today

  whats yore theory asked tomb-
stone soberly

  theory

  yeah you ort to have one person-
ally i aint got any

  you dont know what this is all about
tombstone

  if i did buck id either be runnin
or shootin

  i see-e-e let me ask yuh a straight
question-are you adam jones

  my name is jones replied tomb-
stone and you can make yore own
guesses on the first name

  all right growled the sheriff tell
me who the dude is and why hes here
he says his name is harold ashley
wentworth youll have to make a guess
on the last question cause he aint said
why do you think dave morris was
murdered tombstone

  why buck that aint a fair question
i never even knew the gent

  buck lorimer sighed deeply i reck-
on yuhre as dumb as i am

  and that would make a interestin
contest buck remarked tombstone
we could charge admission and have a
sheepherder ask the questions

  elmer dont know a blasted thing
either sighed buck

  wed let elmer hold our hats

  they ran into elmer potts and elmer
said he wasnt going back to the bar j
with them

  you aint scared are yuh el-mer
asked speedy

  i blamed well am youve been
	exciting

warned and that blasted dude has been
warned when they start shootin el-
mer potts wont mean nothin a-tall to

  i think yuhre crazy to stay here i

  all right its yore funeral wait a
minute in case yuh both get killed
tnight will it be all right for me to tell
buck about that cow and calf

  just be shore we aint playin pos-
sum replied tombstone

their horses had been left at the
sheriffs stable

 i just happened to remember some-
thin pardner speedy said weve still
got to go to the bar j and the road
might not be open for us

 yea-a-a-ah whispered tombstone
thats right ill tell yuh what well do
speedy well ride alone theyll be
lookin for two of us you go first and
ill be about a halfmile behind yuh
why do i go first

  ive alius said you are braver than
me ive alius said that speedy smith
would walk right into a tigers den bare-
handed hes got more cold nerve than
most anybody 

 yeah agreed speedy id do it
find me a tigers den

  well are yuh goin to be a hero or do
we stay in town all night said tomb-
stone wearily

  oh ill go first said speedy give
me about five minutes head start and i
aint goin too fast ill kind of go poco-
poco so they wont figure im in any
hurry

 tombstone sat down in the heavy
shadow and waited giving speedy suffi-
cient time in fact he gave him more
time than agreed upon then tombstone
mounted and headed for the ranch he
didnt hurry either there was only star-
light tonight

  tombstone came in sight of the ranch-
house but drew up quickly the ranch-
house was too well lighted at least it

western

seemed that way to tombstone he won-
dered if speedy had gone straight to
the house

  he was sitting there in the heavy shad-
ow of a clump of old cottonwoods when
he heard the sound of slow hoofbeats
behind him swiftly he reined off the
road the rider came slowly around the
cottonwoods and drew up almost in the
exact place where tombstone had
stopped

  speedy tombstone said

  huh grunted speedy oh hello

i wondered where yuh was

  tombstone rode out beside him

  that house looks awful well lighted
seems to me speedy said

  where-at you been queried tomb-
stone you started ten minutes ahead
of me howd yuh git behind me that- 
away

  well sir replied speedy soberly i
hate to admit it but i got lost

 lost how could yuh git lost
theres only one road

  im goin to have to go back there in
daylight and find out what i done
wrong

  you let me come out here ahead of
yuh accused tombstone

  ive got to git me a compass i can
see that declared speedy

  you yallered-up on me thats what
happened i never thought id live to
relize such a thing speedy

  you aint through the night yet
whats our best move

  weve got to investigate that house
replied tombstone ive got me a hunch
that things aint right nobody bothered
us in town nor on the road

  mebbe theyre scared of us tomb-
stone

  uh-huh thats possible mebbe im
the only brave man left

 aw i wasnt scared protested
speedy i got mself lost

  yea-a-ah and me cornin along that
dark road hummin a song as carefree
as a bird

  stop searin yoreself there wasnt
nobody along the road lets ditch these
broncs in the brush

  they tied the horses in the heavy shad-
ows of the cottonwoods and went cau-
tiously through the brush the slope of
the hill was well brushed all the way to
the fence near the west side of the house
but not high enough to cover their ap-
proach
alias adam jones



  they were within about a hundred feet
of the dwelling when they heard hoof-
beats on the road going toward the
house it was too dark for them to see
the number of riders until they came up
in front of the ranchhouse

  two whispered speedy

  anybody home they heard a voice
call this is buck lorimer

  the sheriff grunted tombstone i
reckon its all right now

 someone must have answered their
hail because both men went into the
house tombstone and speedy relaxed

  dont tell anybody we crawled a hun-
dred yards in cactus speedy said

 wait a minute whispered tomb-
stone look somebody is takin the
horses down toward the stable

  they hunkered in the low brush and
tried to figure out why the sheriff should
take his horse to the stable tombstone
sniffed audibly

  turnin bloodhound already speedy
said

again tombstone sniffed several
more times

  speedy you aint usin per-fume are
yuh

  perfume no i dont reckon i am
at least i aint conscious of any odd
smell about me

  cant yuh smell none

  speedy sniffed then he sniffed sev-
eral times real fast

  by golly i do smell somethin he
whispered it smells like some kind of
perfume too

  tombstone wet the end of a finger and
tested the faint breeze the scent came
from almost due north of where they
were i can smell it plainer now
tombstone muttered and started crawl-

ing off to his left speedy remained
where he was looking toward the lighted
building while tombstone snaked his
way toward a taller clump of bushes

  about two minutes later speedy heard
a low whistle and began crawling to-
ward the sound he found tombstone

  i done found the per-fume tomb-
stone said its marion

  marion gasped speedy she aint
-huh

  shes all right now hog-tied and
gagged

  marion was sitting up in the brush al-
most hysterical and tombstone was try-
ing to get the story from her as speedy
crawled in close

  now just be calm said tombstone
yuhre all right now masked men cap-
tured yuh and brung yuh out here
theyve got harold and sody in the
house thats all plain enough

  they said they didnt want to hurt
me she whispered they said id be
found after it was all over

  thats fine marion after whats all

house suggested speedy

  i-i dont know whispered marion
i heard one of the men say theres

pered speedy that sounds like dyna-
mite yuh dont suppose-

  well i heard one man say you cant
time a thing like that with a fuse and
another one said we dont need to that
battery is still hot

stone seriously

speedy

echo of her yelp for help died away

less yuh have to speedy tombstone
whispered

  somebody cornin hissed speedy

chapter viii

dynamite

ven from where they
were they could hear
a man climb over the
fence he came
through the brush
with no thought of
caution suddenly he
loomed up over them
stumbling searching
for the captive swear-
ing quietly suddenly
his knees were caught
in a pair of encircling
arms and he went
forward over tombstone jones clawing
for his balance he came down with a
crash in the brush before he could get
his breath and yell a warning speedys
two bony knees landed on his back and
speedys forty-five slashed across the
back of his head

  one baby down-one see-gar panted
tombstone shoving the mans legs aside
and getting back to his knees did yuh
pet him hard enough speedy

  well i didnt hold back if thats
what yuh mean

  well use marions ropes on him just
to be sure

  it was rather a queer tableau inside
the main room of the bar j ranchhouse
two lamps were burning brightly one
on the table the other lamp on the man-
tle of the old fireplace in the center of
the room was an object about four feet
high possibly about the same length
the dimensions being problematical be-
cause the whole thing was draped with
an old blanket small black wires snaked
from under it disappearing into the
kitchen

  roped back to back sitting on kitchen
chairs beside this object were buck lor-
imer and elmer potts and harold ash-
ley wentworth and sody white all
four men were gagged with cloths only
alias adam jones	

their eyes showing all they could do
was look and from the expression in
their eyes they didnt like what they
could see

  the only sound was the monotonous
ticking of the old clock on the mantle
the shades were all down the four men
were making no attempt to get loose be-
cause they had tried it many times but
to no avail all they could do was wait
and they knew what they were waiting
for-the arrival of tombstone jones and
speedy smith who had just finished
hog-tieing their captive

 they had no idea who he was and
they didnt want to light a match

  you stay right here tombstone said
to marion this feller cant hurt yuh
none speedy you crawl as far as the
fence if they start shootin pick out
some victim that aint over six feet tall
im goin to walk in and see whats goin
on

  tombstone walked boldly over to the
fence crawled over it and went slowly
toward the house it was too dark to dis-
tinguish objects clearly a man called to
him quietly from near the front of the
house

  is it all right

  yeah replied tombstone huskily
she got the gag loose

  good thing yuh got her you go down
in the corral with ike im scared hell
lose his nerve

  tombstone walked around the rear of
the house and went down to the corral
fence he had no idea where to find ike
he bumped into the fence and he heard
ike bradleys voice

  is that you jim bradley asked

  yeah grunted tombstone feeling
his way through the poles of the corral-
fence

  ike bradley just a darker blur in the
darkness was hunched down behind a
pile of corral posts tombstone hunched
in beside him gun in hand

  why dont they come i wonder ike
bradley said im gettin nervous the
worst of it is we are not even sure
whether this old battery will work i
dont know how to test the blasted thing
and if that thing dont work where will
we be and if it does work-

 thud the complaining cowpoke
sagged sideways sighed heavily and slid
on his ear in the corral dust as tomb-
stone fended him away from the blasting
battery a well-swung six-gun is a cer-

tain anesthetic

  tombstone leaned forward and felt
over the blasting battery of which he
knew nothing at all he found the wires
yanked them loose and tossed the battery
aside at least there would be no ex-
ploding spark shot into that dynamite in
the house

he crawled away across the corral and
was at a corner near the stable when a
man went across the yard and toward the
spot which tombstone had just left
wheres jim the man asked quietly

ttaturally there was no answer

	w the man crawled through the
fence and he must have found the sleep-
ing ike bradley because he went right
back through the fence he stopped
and called

  sil where are yuh sil

  a voice answered from near the stable
and tombstone saw the man hurrying
over to join the man beside the corral
fence tombstone had no idea what move
to make now there were only two men
left of the four he was too far away to
hear their conversation but he saw them
hurrying toward the house

  the kitchen door closed behind them
and tombstone went swiftly toward the
front of the house he didnt know where
speedy was and he didnt want to call
him

  as he hesitated there he heard a crash
in the house the thud of a revolver shot
and hurrying feet tombstone ran to
the back door which opened easily and
quietly through the entrance to the
main room slightly hazy now with
powder smoke he could see two of the
men roped back to back in their chairs

  so yuh thought yuh could come right
in through a window eh a voice said

 i blamed near made it replied
speedy panting heavily

  tie him up snarled a voice at
least weve got one of em

 not the one we want wait make
this feller call to his pardner if he
wont come well kill thisn hes alone
and well git him look you bug-eyed
little road-runner stick yore head
through that winder and call tombstone
jones tell him that well kill all five
of yuh right now if he dont come here
with his hands in the air

  he wont come replied speedy

  he wont eh why wont he

  hes superstitious
	exciting

  you blasted fool snarled one of
them is this any time to be funny

ger

  yuh missed me once-yuh might do
it agin still yuh might not all right
ill call him but it wont do any good i
tell yuh

  it wont eh well you try it and well
judge the results

  speedy limped over to the open win-
dow menaced from behind by two guns
and leaned out over the sill

 tombstone where are yuh he
yelled

  hold it everybody snapped tomb-
stone dont turn around

  he had stepped in through the door-
way to the kitchen and caught both
masked men with their backs to him
they froze for a moment

  drop them guns snapped tomb-
stone

  one man obeyed but the other man
screaming a curse whirled dropped to
his knees and fired one shot into the
blanket-covered pile on the floor

  echoing the report was the crash of
tombstones forty-five and the man who
took a chance of exploding the dynamite
sprawled sideways turned half-over and
flung his gun aside the last man dived
for the open window making a last des-
perate attempt at escape but speedy
blocked him knocked him back into the
room and he fell with his shoulders
against the piled dynamite

  nice work pardner exclaimed
tombstone keep him docile

  he yanked the mask off the man he
had shot and disclosed the face of cort
haden who would never face a court of
law the other man was sil kerr snarl-
ing cursing as speedy rubbed the muz-
zle of his gun against kerrs nose while
tombstone untied the four men

  both sody and harold were on the
point of collapse but managed to grin
weakly glad to be alive and wondering
how it ever had happened elmer fairly
whooped with joy but buck lorimer
just looked dumbly at tombstone and
speedy

  where is marion harold said husk-
ily

  alius thinkin of the ladies grinned
speedy ill get her

  ill lock up this whippoorwill said
elmer and handcuffed sil kerr sheriff
buck lorimer walkd over and looked

sullen-faced kerr

  sil he said quietly cort haden is

yuh know what im askin where did
haden git that note for fifteen thousand
dollars signed by john adam jones

 sil kerr scowled at tombstone

and nodded slowly

jones got drunk over at the lazy h one
night when him and cort was playin
two-handed poker jones eyes was awful
bad and he was drunk he didnt have
no more money and cort had him sign
a note for a hundred and fifty dollars
only he made it fifteen thousand and
the old man never read it

  there was a long silence

alias adam jones



tombstone said finally johnnys free
and the bar j dont owe the lazy h a
cent in fact the lazy h owes the bar
j plenty

  and well see that it gets paid said
buck quietly then he turned and looked
at tombstone jones

asked tombstone shook his head

  this is no time to lie he said i
aint

  then johnny neil will get the ranch
if adam dont show up

 adam jones is dead-so grimes told
me said tombstone i took the name
to keep cort haden from takin over the
ranch

 now said sheriff buck lorimer
turning to harold ashley wentworth
just who on earth are you young fel-
low everybody is guessin are you
from the pinkerton outfit

 harold stared at him and broke out
laughing

  history repeats itself mr lorimer
he said my name is wentworth and i
am not a detective forty years ago my
father came on a hunting trip to this
country and he met a man named john
adam jones my father left all this in
writing to me he was a very wealthy
man if i may brag a little through
circumstances while here in the west
he was mistaken for a pinkerton detec-
tive an outlaw tried to kill him but
his life was saved by john adam jones

  quite a number of years later john
adam jones writing to my father said
that he was broke and would be obliged
to sell his ranch and cattle to pay his
debts my father greatly indebted to
mr jones bought the ranch but told
mr jones to never mention it on my
way to the west coast i stopped to see

what my father owned the deed was
never recorded i believe that is the
reason mr jones never made out a will
harold reached in his pocket and took
out a long wallet opened it and took out
a folded legal paper which he handed to
the sheriff after a quick perusal the
sheriff nodded

that is the deed to the bar j he said
then harold ashley wentworth did
a queer thing they watched him tear
the deed into small pieces and throw
them into the fireplace

  but protested the sheriff that is
yore only evidence that yuh own the
bar j wentworth

  good exclaimed harold i waive
all rights-if johnny and this girl get it
just between us ive had all i want of
either sudden or lingering death mar-
ion with all my-no i wont say it is
with all my worldly goods-but i do
endow you with the bar j

  i dont know what to say said
marion weakly everything is wonder-
ful and i didnt do anything to help
anybody

  dont believe her said speedy if
she hadnt worn perfume wed probly all
be fitted to harps right now

  theres a lot of things i dont quite
get said the sheriff

  thats a normal condition elmer
grinned at him yuh know me and
buck figured that harold was a detec-
tive but we couldnt figure out tomb-
stone and speedy we knew blasted well
that they couldnt be detectives just
why did you two fellers come down into
pintado valley anyway tombstone

  when jube kern pits himself against happyjack ristine the
  towns gun-boss theres a coffin in readiness for the loser

chapter i

lan -badge rendezvous

spring thaws had belatedly re-
leased the grip of snowdrifts from
the mother lode wagon roads and
up from sacramento a wells-fargo stage
thrust deep into the high sierras spear-
heading the first influx of the years
traffic to the gold camps

 ahead of the mud-spattered concord
and the freight wagons queued in its
ruts the news sped from camp to camp



and from claim to claim to reach the
end-of-trail boom town at goldfork a day
in advance of the coachs arrival

 a motley army of jackleg muckers
converged on the town strung out along
the gulch of beardog creek massing in
front of the wells-fargo station to wel-
come the first freight and mail in five
snowbound months

  and in the privacy of his saloon office
over the jackpot saloon happyjack
ristine oiled and loaded his dragoon s
for the first time that winter cursing
himself for a nervous fool as he did so
a complete novelet
by

walker a tompkins

  zeno malone albino-haired bartender
and ristines righthand man stood at the
window overlooking goldforks main
street and sensed the electric tension
which gripped the waiting miners below
perhaps he alone had an inkling of the
strain ristine was undergoing today in
the tense period of waiting for destiny
to arrive on the first stagecoach of the
year

 the acknowledged gun-boss of gold-
fork ristine was a man with few friends
and no confidants a gambling man who
rarely carried guns but who paid well for

earing back the hammer of his
dragoon jube kern rammed the
muzzle deep into the middle of
the astonished gambler

the loyalty and straight shooting of his
underlings

  kern wont be aboard that stage you
can bet your last blue chip on that boss
malone commented tentatively turning
his rabbit-pink eyes toward ristine as
the gambler attempted to flex the useless
tendons of his bullet-ruined right hand
hes either dead or paralyzed and you
know it i-i never seen you spooked
like this before happyjack

  the quick anger in ristines eyes si-
lenced the bartender made the albino re-
gret his impetuous remark a man didnt


	exciting

doubt happyjack ristines courage or if
he did he kept the heresy to himself

  you dont know jubal kern ristine
said and buckled on his gun harness
under the fustian tails of his steelpen
coat

      one in goldfork had taken jube
kerns farewell threat very seri-
ously that snowy night last november
when the boom camp marshal had left
the diggings with ristines derringer
bullet imbedded in his back vanishing
into the teeth of a blizzard that was the
first harbinger of winter to the southern
mines

  look for me back on the first stage
next spring ristine the wounded law-
man had vowed propping himself up on
the warped pine door which had been
laid across the stagecoach seats in lieu
of a stretcher im leaving my law-
badge in your saloon so you wont forget
i aim to show up again and finish this
thing and ill bring a coffin back with
me when i come-for the loser

 happyjack ristine the snowflake
stark on his black dundrearie whiskers
and his right arm cradled in a sling had
nodded and given the only answer a
boom camp gun-boss could have given in
front of the awed crowd

  goldfork carries all the law it needs
on its hip kern but your tin star will
be waiting for you and about that coffin
-make sure you order a long one mar-
shal youre a tall man

  at which the express jehu with an
anxious eye canted to the storm clouds
racking over the sugar pines to west-
ward had larruped his morgans down
the muddy street and vanished into the
thickening limbo that presaged a novem-
ber blizzard   

  roundsiding about it later over gaming
tables and along the various saloon bars
in goldfork the miners who were work-
ing the placer claims over the winter
were unanimous on one thing  jube kern
wouldnt be back his vow to the con-
trary

  more than likely the blizzard would
trap the wells-fargo concord before it
reached the sierra foothills in which
case the driver and shotgun guard would
be lucky to escape with their own lives
then there was the  pellet which
happyjack ristines sleeve gun had sent
smashing into the marshals side
according to sawbones mcguffy

western 

the local medico ristines bullet had
lodged in the marshals backbone and
even if gangrene didnt get him jube
kern was doomed to spend the rest of his
days paralyzed from the waist down

  that had been five months ago a hiatus
during which goldfork had been isolated
from california and the outside world

  braver tongues made foolhardy by
over-indulgence in rotgut whisky had
gossiped vaguely about the two chileno
bushwackers happyjack ristine pur-
portedly had sent to trail kerns stage to
make sure the wounded marshal didnt
get to san francisco

  maybe riatine had done that maybe
not two of his chileno bouncers at the
jackpot saloon had never been seen
since the night of the blizard that
much was fact

  kern had left a memento of his last
shoot-out in goldfork his bullet fired
in self-defense while in the act of arrest-
ing the jackpot owner for defying the
camps gun-toting law had ruined the
gamblers right hand for keeps it was
problematical whether kern had lived
to reach the surgeons in frisco who had
the skill to probe out the derringer slug
in his spine

  no one in goldfork zeno malone least
of all would ever forget how marshal
jube kern had dragged his paralyzed
body across the barroom floor after ris-
tine had fled to the sanctuary of his up-
stairs office a pig-tailed chinese
swamper had helped the wounded law-
man to his feet at the door and in sight
of all kern had unpinned the law badge
from his mackinaw

  ristine had vowed publicly that he
would force kern to surrender the star
that had been bestowed upon him by the
miners law  order committee two
years before when goldfork was fast be-
coming the wildest gold camp in the
mother lode

  but jube kerns gesture had been a
symbol of defiance rather than surrender
with his flagging strength the marshal
stuck the tin star on the breast of the
cigar-store indian by the doorway an
effigy dubbed helldorado harry by the
saloon customers

  tell ristine-ill be back-to get that
star kern had said before the chinese
swamper carried him over to sawbones
mcguffys shanty on the gulch rim

  and the law badge of goldfork camp
had remained where kern had pinned it
the marshal

on helldorado harrys cedarwood bris-
ket through the long winter months
which followed

even after the bandages were re-
moved from his bullet-butchered
gun hand happyjack ristine had elected
to leave the badge where it was it made
a curio that appealed to the morbid ele-
ment in the diggings attracting trade to
the jackpot it was a tangible monu-
ment too to the fact that ristine had
lived up to his boast that no miners
committee marshal would ever enforce
his gun-toting law in the jackpot saloon

  thus helldorado harry the wooden
statue with a tomahawk in one fist and a
bunch of wood-carved cigars in the
other had been goldforks only marshal
following kerns departure it was taken
for granted that the wounded lawman
would never return to claim his badge

 the grapevine says a caravan of
freight wagons are followin the express
coach boss zeno malone spoke up
bridging the awkward silence which had
fallen between them they crossed the
upper fork of the stanislaus around sun-
down last night you aint got long to
wait-to find out the worst

  happyjack ristine moved to the win-
dow scowling down at the jostling
throng of bearded and mackinaw-clad
men who had been drawn to the camp
from near and far

  there were husbands and fathers in
that shaggy multitude who would get
their first mail from home and loved ones
since snow had started to fly there were
business men who had seen the long win-
ter deplete their stock and who were
awaiting shipments of flour and dry-
goods and tools and ammunition in the
loaded conestogas which rumor said
were on their way

  ristine himself had a mercenary in-
terest in the arrival of the first freighters
from the valley for the jackpots bar
like its rival establishment had been as
dry as an old boot for going on six weeks
now zeno malone had a dozen barrels
of whisky coming for which a host of
thirsty miners would part with a sub-
stantial portion of their winters dust by
nightfall

  somewhere down the gulch a shotgun
boomed in signal and jubilant shouts
came relaying up to the boom camp
kindling a frenzy in the close-packed
men waiting at the wells-fargo barn

of goicfork	

 from his elevated lookout in the
upper-story window of the jackpot ris-
tine caught sight of a mud-camouflaged
concord rounding the gulch road half a
mile below a team of morgans straining
at the tugstraps to pull the seasons first
stage through the hub-deep mire

  behind lumbered the canvas-hooded
freight wagons drawn by tandem-hitched
mules

  get out there and be ready to make a
cash bid in case some speculator has a
stock of liquor to auction off zeno ris-
tine ordered his chalk-skinned bartender
well need all the firewater we can get
this will be the most hell-roaring night
in goldforks history mark my word on
that

 following malone down the stairs
from the mezzanine gambling cubicles to
the main barroom happyjack ristine
caught the glitter of the law badge on
the cigar-store indian reflected like a
planet in the backbar mirror

  since jube kern had imbedded the em-
blem in the statues chest against this
fateful day its nickeled surface had been
furbished to glittery brilliance by the
countless sleeves that had rubbed it for
good luck

  from an iron strong-box under the bar
counter ristine took a bottle o rye
which had not been placed on public sale
the last good whisky remaining in the
drought-ridden camp he poured him-
self a stiff dram threw back his head and
tossed the fiery drink down his gullet at
a single gulp

  he wont be on that stage ristine
whispered to his image in the backbar
glass his numb twisted fingers shook
dropping the whisky glass with a tink-
ling crash at his feet kern was dead
before he hit sacramento

  the stagecoach was creaking to a halt
across the street when ristine shoul-
dered through the swing doors and
leaned against an awning post on the
jackpot porch

 reddish sierra mud had completely
stoppered the spokes of the concords
wheels the coach jounced on its bull-
hide thoroughbraces as the passengers
started alighting here at roads end ris-
tines pulses upped their tempo as he
watched the travelers climb out ticking
them off one by one

three dudes from the states come
to el dorado to seek their fortunes
	exciting

in the gold fields a portly drummer for
a los angeles beef rancho old ike gra-
tion the truant wheelwright who had
let winter catch him on a trip down be-
low and that was all the concord
door swung shut of its own weight

  pent-up breaths sighed through the
crowd jubal kern had not made good
on his vow to return on the springs first
stage it had been a dying mans brag a
face-saving gesture on the part of a law-
man who had been unable to tame cali-
fornias toughest gold camp

  a hundred pairs of eyes swiveled to
catch happyjack ristines reaction but
the gamblers narrow face was inscru-
table showing neither relief nor vindica-
tion the mask of a gambler in perfect
control of himself

  ristine took a cuban cheroot from his
flowered waistcoat and bit off the end
jabbing the black weed in his teeth and
fumbling with the stiff fingers of his
game hand in a pocket of his steelpen
coat for flint and steel in the act of
lighting the cigar ristine froze eyes
narrowed in stunned disbelief as he
stared over the heads of the throng

 the concords mud-spattered door
swung open and a tall figure in moleskin
pants and beaver hat and red-checkered
mackinaw stood poised on the iron step
ice-blue eyes shuttling over the crowd
as if drinking in a familiar scene before
alighting from the vehicle

  jube kern the marshals come back
to goldfork

  the whisper passed from lip to lip
until the chant reached ristines ears

  and hes brought a coffin with him
hanged if he aint

chapter ii

coffin consignment

or the first time the
street mob took notice
of the long black box
lashed to the roof of
the concord a crate
which by its sinister
dimensions and the
off-square angles of
its side walls could be
mistaken for nothing
but a grave casket

 spring sunlight
threw harsh shadows
across the gaunt face
of the marshal revealing the stamp of

western

past suffering there revealing a pallor
gained from long months in a hospital
an ordeal that had threaded the young
giants thick brown hair with a sprinkle
of silver

 then kern stepped down into the
ankle deep ooze his towering figure
looming head-high above the throng as
his sour gaze raked the sea of familiar
faces

  an aisle spread in the press of bodies
then an aisle which angled across the
street to the steps of the jackpot saloon
where happyjack ristine stood trans-
fixed by a porch post

  jube kern walking with a slight limp
which hadnt been there half a year ago
headed toward ristines saloon with his
eyes holding the vacant off-focus stare
of a man who had come to the end of a
long and gruelling journey

  hey mister kern the wells-fargo
driver called after him whipping his
lines around the jacob staff and standing
up in the stage boot where do you
want this here coffin took

  kern halted turning slowly to regard
the wells-fargo man

  oh unload it at coltons gold ex-
change will you jeb youll need two-
three men to help you its heavy

  happyjack ristine his usual florid
countenance bleached ashen behind purl-
ing cigar smoke unbuttoned his prince
albert to expose the polished buckles of
twin gunbelts as the marshal of goldfork
climbed the saloon steps and paused at
arms length from the gambler

  converging waves of humanity closed
in the gap in the crowd the churning
sound of hobbed boots in the mud being
the only noise that disturbed the gelid
quiet

  ive come for my badge happyjack

  the cheroot twitched between ris-
tines clamped teeth he jerked his head
toward the slatted halfdoors

  its where you left it marshal

  boots thudded on the plank floor of
the porch as the crowd pressed in eyes
riveted on the two enemies as they
stepped into the barroom the doors
fanned behind them but they could tell
that jube kern had halted before the
hawk-faced wooden statue of helldorado
harry

  knots of muscle flicked under ris-
tines sable dundrearies as he watched
the marshal tug the nickel-plated star
from the cigar-store indian and pin it to
the marshal

the fabric of his mackinaw lapel

 there were elements of melodrama in
kerns act but the marshals clean-
shaven face held no hint of bravado as he
wheeled to face the saloonkeeper at his
elbow

  how many killings he asked bluntly
have there been in goldfork since i
went below ristine

 the gambler flicked ash from the
glowing tip of his cheroot eyeing the
lawman with the queer musing of a man
who would never make the mistake of
underestimating an adversary

 suppose we put our cards on the
table jube ristine proposed finally
you and i had our differences in the
past i figure neither of us has anything
to gain by-

 you claimed goldfork didnt need a
lawman kern cut in youve had five
months to prove it ristine there was
an average of a killing a week in your
saloon alone before the miners law and
order committee appointed me marshal

i trimmed that figure considerable now
i aim to find out if the diggings tamed
down of its own accord while i was
away if all this needless bloodshed
tapered off maybe youre right maybe
goldfork dont need a marshal

  ristine sucked at his cheroot thought-
fully stalling for time finally he held
out his withered right hand livid with
scar tissue and knobby with poorly
knitted bones showing the marshal
where his bullet had wrecked the hand
beyond repair

 frisco patched you up as good as
ever kern the gambler said evasively
as you see ill carry your brand as long
as i live dont you figure our accounts
are evened up aint goldfork big
enough to hold the two of us

jube kern leaned an elbow against
the wooden indian easing the
weight off a hip that would never be
quite right again despite the miracle of
surgery that had removed ristines
bullet from his spinal column and
patched up the damaged nerves there

  at thirty-five kern had suffered tor-
tures and the mark of that agony had
added ten years to his appearance but
his level eyes had lost none of their can-
dor his brain none of its rare under-
standing of what made men tick

 staring at happyjack ristine now
kern did not make the error of assuming

of goldfork	

that his sworn enemy was going soft
yielding to the pressure of public opin-
ion ristine was volunteering a truce be-
tween them knowing even as he spoke
that goldfork was not big enough for
both of them and never would be again

  it goes far deeper than mere personal
hatred between the two of us ristine
the marshal argued grimly its the
wild element you represent the hood-
lums who have given goldfork its repu-
tation for being a sinkhole of outlawry

 but i give my customers what
they-

  let me finish ristine the decent
citizens of this camp have paid me to
stamp out the gun-law you represent i
didnt come back into the mother lode
country to accept any compromises with
you or any of your stripe ristine

  cold lights flickered in the gamblers
hooded eyes he hunched his big shoul-
ders inside the fustian steelpen recog-
nizing the lawmans ultimatum and elect-
ing to stand pat

  what do you aim to do first mar-
shal he inquired coldly

  jube kern reached in a pocket of his
mackinaw and drew out a folded card-
board placard without comment he
handed it to ristine it was a duplicate
of the poster which kern had had
printed over in sonora and tacked on
walls and fence posts around goldfork
the previous fall

 no gun toting in goldfork
effective at sundown this date it will be illegal
for any citizen of goldfork and vicinity to carry
weapons concealed or otherwise while inside
the limits of this camp rifleb pistols and
shotguns will be checked with the undersigned
at the goldfork jailhouse on nugget street
upon entering town and will be redeemable
upon departure the above ruling applies to
blackjacks brass knuckles shot-loaded quirts
and all knives measuring six inches or more in
overall length violation of this rule will result
in arrest and jury trial by the goldfork miners
law  order committee

              signed jubal kern
                         camp marshal

  im posting another batch of these
notices at once ristine kern said
enforcing this gun-toting law will cut
down killings and street fights over-
night

  ristine handed the poster back to the
marshal hitching his own gun belts ar-
rogantly as kern pushed through the
batwings to face the crowd on the porch
outside
	exciting

   ill be at my office in the jailhouse
 two hours before the sunset deadline
 ristine the marshal said pointedly
 ill expect you to drop around and
 check that hardware of yours or face
 the consequences you might pass the
 word along to your customers

   kern paused to pry a pair of rusty
 tacks from a bulletin board on the clap-
 board wall of the jackpot and tack his
 printed ultimatum thereon with the han-
 dle of his jackknife

   then the marshal limped down the
 steps and pushed off through the crowd
 acknowledging greetings of old friends
 with curt nods the law had come back
 to goldfork to stay

 behind kern the throng crowded
 around the sign educated miners in the
 forefront reading kerns declaration of
 war against the camps owlhoot element
 for the benefit of the illiterates

   why kerns as good as signed his
 own death warrant spoke up a bearded
 hardrock miner whose six-gun strapped
 in plain sight outside his buffalo coat
 had notches filed conspicuously on the
 backstrap im danged if ill give up
 my hawgleg for no marshal and to blazes
 with the law an order committee

   a rumble of mixed comment followed
 the miners outburst

   kern is sailin for showdown - i
 agree with you there troll vouchsafed
 sol kreidler owner of the okay mer-
 cantile store but as a charter member
 of the committee im telling you a gun-
 toting law is one thing this camp has got
 to have i aim to check my forty-four
 with the marshal

 calling at the wells-fargo office
 jube kern claimed his carpetbag
 from the agent then he headed up
 nugget street and turned in at the fa-
 miliar brick building which the miners
 law  order committee had built to
 serve as a jail kerns sleeping quarters
 were in a lean-to behind the calaboose

   old memories stirred the marshal as
 he unlocked the door of his shanty
 nothing had been disturbed during his
 half-years absence the framed photo-
 graph of vola colton still stood on the
 table by his bunk a cherished christmas
 gift which he would have pawned his
 soul to have had with him at the hospi-
 tal in frisco to ease the monotony of
 his convalescence

   he stood staring at the girls tintype

western

likeness for a long minute then inhaled
deeply and tossed his carpetbag on the
bunk

  taking a ring of brass keys from his
pocket he unlocked the jail and gave the
cell block and his office a leisurely in-
spection obviously the building had
not been opened during his absence-
a fact which did not surprise him inas-
much as he had left town with the only
set of jail keys on the other hand the
committee could have had saleratus
burke the local locksmith make a new
set of keys if the camp had actually
needed the jail on the face of it it
would seem that goldfork had no need
for a bastille to house its wrongdoers
much less a marshal

  leaving the jail with a bundle of print-
ed placards and a tack hammer under his
arm kern headed back to the main street
and crossed over to gideon coltons
gold exchange a squat brick structure
with barred windows and a corrugated
iron roof coltons was the bank where
miners weighed in their dust and nug-
gets and received currency or specie in
exchange

  a girl wearing levis and a red wool
shirt was waiting for him in the door-
way of the exchange seeing her
there exactly as he had remembered her
last jube kern knew he had returned at
last to the fountainhead of strength
which had given him the will to pull
through after medicos in san francisco
had pronounced his case hopeless

  its me vola the marshal grinned
halting at the doorstep ive lost
twenty-thirty pounds of tallow and ive
got some gray hairs and a steady limp
but im back like i promised you id be
last thanksgiving

  tears flooded vola coltons amber
eyes as their hands touched and then
she was in his arms her cheek pressed
against the cold metal of the law badge
on his mackinaw

  its been unendurable jube she
whispered as their lips parted a little
later not being able to get out of
these terrible mountains all winter not
being able to send or receive a letter yet
knowing you needed me so and wonder-
ing if you were alive or dead

  he held her at arms length reveling
in the beauty of her clustering chestnut
hair watching the haunted look fade
from her eyes for the first time in five
months
  not yet twenty gid coltons daughter
was a rarity in the southern mines an
unmarried girl in a land that was starved
for feminine companionship a girl who
had pledged herself for eternity to a
man the diggings said would never re-
turn

 you shouldnt have done it jube
she said finally when the first ecstasy
of their reunion had spent itself

  kerns brows arched quizzically

 done what-come back to the girl i
aim to marry he chided grinning
down at her

 she blushed taking a bandanna from
her denim trousers and dabbing at her
lashes

  no-that coffin you shipped up here
she answered i didnt meet the stage
because i couldnt have borne it if you
hadnt been aboard jube but when the
driver unloaded that awful casket and
said youd gone into ristines dive to
get back your badge i was cold with
dread

 gideon colton interrupted them at
the doorway then a weather-beaten
erect man of forty with a distinguished
gray imperial

 as they shook hands kern glanced
past him and saw the black pine cof-
fin he had purchased in san francisco a
week ago was now blocking the floor in
front of the counter where colton kept
his gold scales

  it goes without saying that im glad
our prayers were answered and your
health has been restored son the bank-
er said gruffly but i thought you
were more level-headed than to make
good that crazy promise of yours to
come back with a coffin for happyjack
ristine jube it aint like you to pull
a story-book stunt like that youre
practically inviting ristines gunmen to
bushwhack you one of these nights

 kern grinned unperturbed by the
bankers diatribe

 you cant buy a box or a crate in
frisco for love or money these days
gid he said wait till you see whats
in that coffin its the only kind of a
receptacle i could get hold of

  vola colton and her father stared cu-
riously as kern went behind the gold
exchange counter and found coltons
toolbox in its accustomed place

 he returned with a short iron crow-
bar and proceeded to pry open the lid
of the black coffin

the marshal of goldfork	

  books exclaimed the girl dropping
on her knees beside the tightly-crammed
casket no wonder it weighed like a
ton of bricks

chapter iii
sundown ultimatum

ern set the coffin
lid to one side and
watched vola run her
fingers along a set
of calfhide encyclo-
pedia then tug out
a massive morocco-
bound volume of
shakespeare from the
hundreds of books
which the coffin con-
tained

 books from
around the horn -
and they sold for a song down on the
embarcadero like so much ballast jube
kern explained jubilantly enough to
set up a library for those who know how
to read in these diggings vola

  the girl ran her fingers almost loving-
ly over the backs of novels and other
reading matter which would be worth
far more than their weight in gold up
here in this isolated backwash of the
argonaut country

  i cant thank you enough jube she
whispered these are the first books
beside dads bible that ive seen since
we left missouri in forty-eight
gideon colton blew his nose loudly
busy riffling the pages of a law tome
by blackstone

  well stow these books in the fruit
closet out in the kitchen for the time
bein honey the banker said and
then i aim to chop this coffin into kin-
dlin wood and let the whole town know
what i did with it five gets you ten
that happyjack ristine and his jackpot
cutthroats are plotting right now to lay
your carcass out in this box inside of
twenty-four hours

  the grin faded from the marshals
lips as reality crowded in about him
once more

  as chairman of the law and order
committee gid kern said i reckon
you still give your backing to a no gun-
toting law for goldfork

  colton fingered his white tuft of chin
whiskers
	exciting

  youre talking true son we werent
able to hire a marshal with courage
enough to wear the star you pinned onto
that wooden injun at ristines saloon
and i havent tallied up how many kill-
ings this camp has seen during the win-
ter-most of them drunken brawls that
would have wound up as harmless fist
fights if the drunks werent toting shoot-
ing irons when they came to town
jube kern shifted the package of
placards under his arm

  things will be different after sun-
down tonight he promised gravely
which reminds me-i got a little job
of bill posting to do around this camp
here and now

  gideon colton went to the window
laced his hands behind his back and
stared off at the crowded main street

  you couldnt have chosen a worse
night in the year to inaugurate your
gun-totin law jube he commented
along with your stage the first whis-
ky this camp has seen in weeks arrived
at the saloons the gamblin dens will
play to sky-high stakes the lids off
in goldfork tonight therell be some
new graves up the hillside tomorrow
im afraid

  jube kern paused with his hand on
the doorknob reading the anguish in
vola coltons eyes everything in the
girl cried out to halt the marshal yet
both of them knew she would not speak
the sentiments which were so close to
her heart

  i couldnt have chosen a better night
gid the marshal insisted the time
to clamp down the lid is before it gets
a chance to blow off tomorrow would
be too late

  tension mounted in gulch-rimmed
goldfork as the coppery globe of the sun
westered closer to the pine-grown sky-
line of the sierra nevadas down-canyon
below the camp

  there was whisky to be had in town
tonight ending a bar famine of over two
months duration whisky bred trouble
and trouble was a marshals business
goldfork had a marshal again these
two facts were carried by the grapevine
to the uttermost cabin and muckers tent
on the up-creek placer claims

  miners deserted their long toms and
gold pans in the remote canyons for the
first time in weeks and trooped to the
gulch town to celebrate on trees bor-
dering every incoming trail to gold-

western

fork the miners passed printed posters
notifying them of marshal jube kerns
gun-toting law once more in effect in
goldfork

some innate sense of sportsmanship
engendered by a vague admiration
for kerns return to a camp where sure
death would be at his elbow every hour
around the clock prompted a goodly
percentage of the incoming argonauts
to drop around by the jail on nugget
street and surrender what knives and
firearms they happened to be toting

  you aint going to consider this here
allens pepperbox of mine a deadly
weapon are you marshal joshed sal-
eratus burke the locksmith turning in a
six-barreled revolver which had enjoyed
a plentiful sale to tenderfoots back east
heading for the gold fields of el dorado

  jube kern scribbled off a receipt
tagged the allen contraption and hung
it on a wall nail

  theres a circuit judge down mari-
posa way who turned a murder suspect
loose because he said it was impossible
to kill or injure anybody with one of
these pepperboxes kern admitted
handing burke his numbered ticket
but well overlook his ruling saleratus
after all its just three pounds of iron
to pack around in your jeans

 by the time the sun touched the
crowns of the sugar pines on the gulch
rimrocks kerns office resembled an
arsenal with weapons ranging from
sharps buffalo rifles to dull-edged bar-
low knives hanging on the wall above
his desk

  with the coming of sunset and the
deadline of kerns ultimatum the mar-
shal took care of the last-minute rush
of business from the boasters and late
arrivals who had decided not to defy
the committees edict

 dusk was running down the gulch
when jube kern locked his jail office
and headed for the gold exchange
where he had accepted an invitation to
have supper with vola and her father

  the young lawman ran a gauntlet of
good-natured jibes during his saunter
down the main street but he took the
hoo-rawing in the same spirit it was
given what counted was that he failed
to spot a single miner wearing a gun belt
or sheath knife in defiance of his posted
order

  sol kreidler buttonholed kern as he
the marshal of goldfork	

passed the okay mercantile store

  all this forty-rod likker coming to
town will have the gutters flowin red
with blood by midnight jube kreidler
said pessimistically i sort of wish
youd held off one more day for your
own safety

  kern grinned but his voice held no
mirth

  other camps from mariposa to grass
valley have gun-toting laws and they
enforce em sol theres no reason why
goldfork cant do the same

  ten minutes later seated at table with
vola and old gid kern heard the ques-
tion he had been dreading

 have ristine and malone and his
jackpot crew turned in their artillery
yet son

  kern saw volas troubled eyes fixed on
his face as he shook his head

  not yet im hoping to find their
hardware stacked on the jail steps after
i finish supper gid

  and if you dont volas voice held
a harsh note of anxiety the firt hint of
strain she had revealed all evening

  jube kern shrugged pouring sorghum
on one of volas fluffy soda biscuits

  i reckon i know where ristine can
be found he said he turned to the
gold exchange banker with a cheerful
grin i see youve stacked those books
in the fruit closet gid i hope you
wont make good on that josh about
chopping my coffin into stovewood it
set me back two hundred bucks for that
pine box and i had to give up the silver
handles that went with it

  night had descended over goldforks
tarpaper-roofed shacks when kern
walking with a barely perceptible limp
made his way down the muddy street
between the unpainted false fronts

  the makings of trouble were rife in
goldfork tonight besides the unpre-
cedented influx of yankee and chinese
miners a contingent of me-yuk bucks
and their squaws from a rancheree back
in the hills had arrived trying to swap
furs for firewater

lights glowed from the windows in
goldforks twenty-odd saloons and
gambling halls with every establishment
crowded with miners and buckskin-clad
hunters eager to buck the tiger and get
drunk

  jangly music came from the forty-
niner dancehall where booted muckers

were square dancing with the painted
jezebels who had arrived from sonora
and jimtown that evening

  arriving at the jail kern found a half-
tipsy hostler from the bigstrike livery
barn waiting for him on the steps with
a rusty-bladed bowie knife

  aim to obey the law hiccoughed the
stable boy mighty glad you pulled
through jube

  kern grinned noting that ristine had
not sent a swamper over from the jack-
pot with his quota of firearms

  thanks jerry its mostly the out-
of-town buckos im interested in de-
horning you can pick up this skinnin
knife in the morning huh

  the main stem was ominously desert-
ed when jube kern arrived at the jack-
pot saloon and crossed the porch he
paused by the batwings to unbutton his
wool mackinaw then pushed inside

  a sudden hush congealed inside the
barroom as the marshal stepped over be-
side the wooden figure of helldorado
harry and stood surveying the crowded
hall

  zeno malone his albino hair and pink
eyes accentuated by the snowy fabric of
his bar apron was busy setting up drinks
to the rough-dressed customers lining
the brass rail eager to get their share
of whisky before the limited supply ran
out another freight wagon might not
get up from the valley for weeks

  whale-oil lamps guttered from ceiling
beams under the mezzanine gallery
sounds of revelry came from ristines
private gaming rooms upstairs the at-
mosphere was cloyed with tobacco
smoke and the fumes of liquor and hu-
man sweat

  then kern spotted happyjack ris-
tine

  the frock-coated gambler turned over
his roulette wheel to a croupier and
headed across the sawdust-sprinkled
puncheon floor his cheroot trailing a
ribbon of blue smoke as he headed
toward the marshal

  lamplight refracted from a pair of
pearl-handled dragoon colts buckled
ostentatiously on the outside of ris-
tines fustian swallowtail coat

  howdy marshal ristines purred
greeting carried to the far ends of the
barroom arresting the attention of
drinkers and card players alike look-
in for somebody in particular

  kern balanced on the toes of his
	exciting

boots favoring his aching leg he
swung his mackinaw tails back to reveal
his own thonged-down gun his palms
planted akimbo on his hips

  since when he asked casually did
you go in for packing guns in plain
sight happyjack i thought sleeve
derringers were more your style

  ristine shrugged dragging a ruby fin-
ger down his coal-black sidewhiskers
through the tail of his eye jube kern
saw two of the jackpots mexican
bouncers edging off to one side ready
to catch the lawman in a cross-fire if
trouble developed

  a gentleman can change his mind
ristine grunted savoring the tension of
the moment like i told you a man
carries his law on his hip here in gold-
fork

  kern shook his head his sidewise
stare halting the pair of mexicans in

western

ristines fancy vest where a gold-nugget
watch chain hung in bright nodes be-
tween his pockets

  youre under arrest for illegal pos-
session of firearms ristine kerns
voice was pitched low but it carried the
impact of a thunderclap im jailing
you for the night the miners law
and order committee will hear your
case in open trial first thing in the morn-
ing 

  ristine did not change expression by
so much as a flutter of an eyelid he
shrugged lifting both hands to the
level of his head

  im your prisoner marshal he said
mockingly lead the way i dont
argue with a gun prodding my middle
button

  kerns eyes darted over the barroom
crowd jelled in a stunned tableau be-
hind the gambler he reached out with

next issue tombstone and speedy in
bandit busters of war dance
an exciting complete novel by w c tuttle

their sidling progress toward the left
and of the bar counter

 uh-uh happyjack that was when
this camp didnt have a duly-appointed
marshal to keep the peace

  ristine paused in front of the law-
man the ruby coal on the tip end of his
cheroot ebbing and glowing as he sucked
the weed kern had not budged from
his steps his back to helldorado harry
his eyes commanding every angle of the
barroom

  is that what you come into my place
to tell me marshal goaded the gam-
bler his voice raspy with veiled menace
isnt my house keeping itself under
control enough to suit you

  kern fanned a burst of cheroot smoke
away from his eyes with his left hand

  theres no gun-toting in town after
sundown tonight he reminded ristine
calmly or had you forgotten

few in the barroom saw what hap-
pened next

  one instant jube kerns right hand
was at ease on his hip splayed fingers
holding back the heavy folds of his
mackinaw the next his cedar-stocked
dragoon was in his fist thumb earing
the knurled hammer back at full cock
the muzzle end reamed sight-deep into

his free hand and took over ristines
brace of s slipping them into the
roomy pocket of his mackinaw

  then he backed out through the slat-
ted batwings into the night ristine fol-
lowing with arms raised

  no words passed between the men as
ristine set off in the direction of nugget
street kern kept to the middle of the
street away from the lamplighted gut-
ters crowding his prisoner close to block
any attempt of a drygulcher opening
fire from the black alleys flanking the
street

  two minutes later the marshal was
checking the lock of a jail cell after
frisking the gambler and producing a
 hideout derringer in a spring-clip
holster under ristines left cuff

  youll find blankets and a pitcher of
water there kern said brusquely you
honed to make a test case out of this
its lucky your barroom gunhawks
didnt grab for leather

  ristines lips held a mocking grin in
the glare of the jail lantern the lattice-
work bars falling in a check pattern
across the narrow planes of his face

  my men wouldnt think of defying
the law kern ristine said with oily
sarcasm especially as long as i was in
the line of fire
the marshal of goldfork

chapter iv

bait for a death trap

rimly kern locked
the cell-block door
and blew out his office
lamp his face held
worried lines as he
stepped out of the jail
building putting the
wall to his back while
he probed the shad-
ows around him

 things had gone
too easy it was as if
ristine had antici-
pated his arrest had
baited kern into carrying through his
bluff there was hidden menace in the
casual acceptance with which ristine
had responded to his arrest over in the
jackpot

reaching the plank boardwalk on the
main street kern paused indecisively

  other men in the jackpot saloon in-
cluding the albino malone and his mexi-
can bouncers were packing guns in plain
sight but jube kern was a patient and
careful man cleaning out a nest of law-
breakers in a hostile saloon would be
suicidal for one man and kern had no
intention of enlisting the members of
gideon coltons committee to back his
play tonight he would tame the camp
on a lone-wolf basis or not at all

 tomorrow a miners jury would con-
demn ristine to banishment from gold-
fork give him twenty-four hours to wind
up his business affairs and leave the
diggings as an accessory to most of the
crimes committed in the camp to date

  once they were without a leader zeno
malone and the other hoodlums would
fall into line

 having made his decision jube kern
headed for the gold exchange vola col-
ton had seen her man leave this night
with little hope of his return 

  there was plenty of time between now
and midnight to make his routine rounds
of the other saloons in town and to check
up on the me-yuks camped down by the
creek

 bartender zeno malone took advan-
tage of the excitement which seized the
jackpot barroom following ristines
arrest to slip into the storeroom behind
the bar where he kept his barreled liquor

shedding his bar apron the albino



donned a flat-crowned hat and stepped
out into the night through a back door

  he crossed a vacant lot behind sol
kreidlers mercantile store and followed
an alley to bonanza street waiting for
him there was the buffalo-coated figure
of saleratus burke a grizzled irishman
who had found placer mining too tough
for a man of his eighty-odd years and
who had opened a locksmith and tinware
shop on the side street

  without speaking the two moved by
prearranged plan to burkes sod-roofed
clapboard shanty at the intersection of
the main street the old locksmith made
sure his window blinds were drawn be-
fore lighting the wick of his whale-oil
lamp

  seems kern took the only jail keys
with him when he went below last fall
the old irishman chuckled as he moved
over to his workbench and hauled open a
drawer when gid colton got me to fit
new keys to the calaboose last christmas
i figgered a duplicate set might come in
handy some time

  the bartenders albino-pink eyes
flashed with suppressed excitement as he
watched the old artisan fish in his junk
drawer and exhume a ring of shiny new
keys from their hiding place

  happyjack will pay you off with a
poke of dust big enough to choke a jenny
ass saleratus the bartender grunted
thrusting the keys in a pocket of his lin-
sey-woolsey shirt you better head back
to the jackpot and act like nothing hap-
pened after the smoke settles tonight
somebody on the committee might put
two an two together and start asking
questions about the way ristine broke
jail so easy

  saleratus spat a gobbet of tobacco juice
at the wick of the whaleoil lamp and ex-
tinguished it he followed the barkeep
outdoors

  reckon youll need any help he
asked hopefully just for the looks of
it i checked my old allens pepperbox
with the marshal this evenin but i still
got my cap-an-ball pistol loaded for
business

  burke shook his head

  ristine and me can punch kerns
ticket without extry help thanks
leaving burkes shanty malone cut
wide up the logged-off slope which had
provided the whipsaw lumber for gold-
forks housing needs skirted the new
stampmill which the quartz mining syn-
western

	exciting

dicate was building and dropped down
the mountainside toward the jail on
nugget street

  he paused in the shadow of an ailan-
thus thicket near the jail yard checking
the loads in his own guns and scouting
the lay of the land before emerging into
the open the marshals office and lean-
to living quarters were dark a light
burned in the cell block proper where
ristine was incarcerated

malone made an exploratory cir-
cuit of the jail building before
presenting himself at the marshals office
door his cautious knock brought no
response kern was out

  selecting a key from the set which
saleratus burke had fabricated for the
committee last winter malone unlocked
the door and stepped into kerns office
guided to the cell block door by the
shaft of light at the threshold zeno ma-
lone squinted through the big keyhole to
make sure ristine was the only prisoner
inside the jail at the moment and then
unlocked the inner door

  happyjack ristine got up from his cell
cot but showed no other reaction to his
henchmans arrival as the snow-haired
bartender tested keys in the cell lock un-
til he found the proper one a moment
later ristine was walking into kerns
office

  keep the key ring ristine whis-
pered fumbling among the guns hanging
from wall pegs until he discovered his
own pair of pearl-handled dragoons no
use implicating old saleratus we can
toss em in the creek later

  holstering his guns ristine led the
way out into the night they paused in
the clotted shadow by the brick wall
listening to the tinpanny dance music
from the forty niner wafting across the
spring night

  kern may be makin his rounds ma-
lone suggested shall we wait here

 a scowl was forming between ris-
tines brows as he stared off through
the night in the direction of the gold
exchange

  i saw the marshal head direct for
coltons he grunted thats as good
a place as any for a showdown with that
son

  malone started to say something then
thought better of it of all the men who
had attempted to court vola colton
happyjack ristine had been most sensi-

tive to the girls rebuffs it was an-
other score ristine had to settle against
the young marshal of goldfork before
this night was much older a score that
came very close to being the motive for
ristines deep-rooted hatred for jubal
kern

  they crossed the main street and ap-
proached the gold exchange through a
corner lot that was overgrown with a
jungle of wild raspberry bushes from
the concealment of the dense brambles
they saw that the front office of the
exchange was dark shutters drawn be-
hind its formidable iron-barred windows

 old gideon and his daughter had
lived in the back rooms of the gold
exchange ever since mrs colton
had died in the smallpox epidemic
which had swept the southern mines in
eighteen-fifty skirting the side wall
the two conspirators saw lamplight
glowing through pinholes in the green
window shades of the colton kitchen

  muted conversation reached their ears
as ristine and malone left the shelter
of the raspberry thicket and stalked to
the kitchen wall through the clap-
boards they heard vola coltons melo-
dious laugh a sound which brought hot
blood rushing to ristines cheeks
vola had never laughed like that when
he was paying court to her

  i figure the days of placer mining are
about done for around this gulch gid
it was jube kerns voice the big
combines will take over the quartz
mines and your business will die along
with the jackleg muckers on their two-
bit claims have you decided to stay
in california of-

  the voices faded as ristine and the
albino bartender made their way around
the rear corner of the building a streak
of light from a chinese josshouse across
the alley guided them to the kitchen
door

  ristine muttered an impatient oath as
he tested the latch and found the door
fastened on the inside

  you drop back and cover the kitchen
window in case the marshal tries to
make a break zeno whispered the sa-
loonman he cant get out through the
front office colton keeps the exchange
locked up nights like a bank

  malone slipped around the corner of
the building to carry out his chiefs or-
der ristine waited for two minutes
drawing in a deep breath and holding it
the marshal of goldfork

to steady the tom-tomming pulse which
pounded in his eardrums

  his right hand was useless a fact ris-
tine had difficulty in adjusting himself
to he transferred a gun to his left hand
and drew back lunging against the flim-
sy door with his shoulder

  the pot-metal latch shattered and ris-
tine smashed his way onto the back
porch

  inside the kitchen he heard a sudden
startled hush followed by a scuffle of
boots and excited whisperings

a quick leap carried ristine to the
kitchen door opening off the porch
he fumbled at the knob with his numb
right hand felt the door butt solidly
against a bar on the inside

  what is it came gideon coltons
bellow whos there

  ristine stepped back gun leveled
tell that marshal to come out with
his hands raised gid the gambler
rasped out the place is surrounded
there was a moment of tense whisper-
ing inside the kitchen then vola col-
ton spoke up timorously

  jube kern-isnt here

 with a cold laugh the saloonman
squeezed trigger to send a  slug ham-
mering into the door lock it shattered
but the inner bar held

  there was a jangle of glass inside the
kitchen proof that zeno malone had
knocked out the pane with his gun bar-
rel

 with savage impatience happyjack
ristine hurled himself at the kitchen
door felt the hickory bar rip out of its
socket he recovered his balance and
leaped back into the porch shadows as
the door slammed open revealing gid-
eon colton and his daughter standing
side by side by the kitchen stove

  ristine saw no trace of the marshal
inside the kitchen that could mean but
one thing jube kern must be waiting
against the back wall out of range of
his vision or perhaps he had leaped
into the adjoining parlor

 walk on in boss came malones
triumphant yell from behind the
smashed-out window the marshal
ducked into that closet behind the stove
yonder hes a dead pigeon

  vola gave a low cry of horror as ris-
tine crouched low slipped through the
door and moved quickly to one side in
case the hidden lawman attempted a



blind shot through the door of the fruit
closet

  the saloonmans gun covered colton
and his daughter the muzzle weaving
from target to target like a snakes head
both of the coltons had gone bone-
white their eyes straying automatically
to the flimsy wallpaper-covered door
masking the entrance to a storage closet
beside the stove

  come on in zeno ristine called to
his accomplice outside the window mov-
ing to put the coltons between himself
and the closet door where jube kern
crouched in hiding dont budge an
inch you two

  gideon coltons craggy face mottled
with anger as he stared at the weaving
bore of ristines pistol vola recoiled
involuntarily as zeno malone stalked in
from the back door twin six-guns jut-
ting from waist level the albinos rab-
bit eyes glowed in the lampshine

  take vola and the old man into the
sitting room zeno ristine ordered
his voice a harsh whisper i dont want
anybody in the way when i settle kerns
account

  jube kerns mufflled voice sounded
from the cramped confines of the fruit
closet

for suicide yet awhile

  a lethal grin relaxed ristines mouth
this would be rare sport judging from
the size of the closet door jube kerns
bulky frame must be cramped double in
the tiny cubicle behind the paper-cov-
ered boards without so much as a crack
through which to sight his own guns
exciting western



it was a death-trap made to order

  its your hide kern

  from the living room vola colton
gave a sharp cry as she saw ristine
level his six-gun at the closet door the
gun spat flame and bucked in ristines
grasp the slug punching a slot through
the dead center of the square door

  as if seized with a nameless insan-
ity ristine tripped his gunhammer five
times as rapidly as he could ear back
the prong shooting a loose pattern of
bullet holes through the flimsy pine
boards

  then pouching the empty dragoon
ristine reached across to his second colt
and emptied it spacing the slugs evenly
over the four quarters of the door rid-
dling the thin boards high and low and
in the center

  a sagging weight caused the door to
bulge against its latch through bounc-
ing layers of milky gunsmoke ristine
stared across the kitchen eyes drawn in
fatal fascination to a rivulet of crimson
fluid which leaked under the door and
spread in an ever-widening pool across
the floor boards

  the frenzied laughter of a madman
burst from happyjack ristines lips as
he reloaded his dragoons with powder
and shot and percussion and fired an-
other dozen slugs into the perforated
panels of the closet where jube kern
had been crazy enough to take conceal-
ment

  the bright red puddle spread its tell-
tale mirror under the door as ristine
emptied his last gun chamber and thrust
hot-bored colts into leather

  then he crossed the smoky kitchen in
three strides and jerked the doorknob
of the closet only to find that jube kern
had locked the cabinet from the inside

  fetch gid and the girl back in here
zeno the gambler called out his voice
shaky from the reaction of his throbbing
nerves i want em to see the carcass
ive got for that coffin jube kern shipped
up here this morning

  vola colton appeared in the living
room doorway her eyes swinging toward
the bullet-riddled closet she clutched
her fathers arm for support as zeno
malone ushered them to the far corner
of the room opposite the closet

 then vola sighted the red puddle
seeping under the door and she sagged
fainting on gideons supporting arm

  i didnt have anything agin you gid-

eon ristine panted mopping his sweat-
rinsed face with a fustian sleeve not
even when you organized your commit-
tee with the idea of locking up my sa-
loon and running me out of goldfork
but youve seen too much tonight for me
to risk letting you live

  colton carried the inert body of his
daughter to a chair by the kitchen table
zeno malone circling to keep them un-
der the menace of his guns

 dont get tender-hearted notions
about sparin the filly boss the albino
spoke up warningly she seen and heard
as much as the old man shell hate your
hide worse than ever for cashing in
kerns chips ill fix her if youve lost
your nerve

  ristine stalked over to the table his
eyes riveted on vola coltons marble-
white face her body held in gideons
sheltering embrace

  and to think i loved that girl-would
have offered her diamonds and fine feath-
ers and travel and everything a womans
heart could desire-

coltons oath interrupted ristines
half-whispered revery

  go ahead panted the banker franti-
cally shoot and be hanged to you ris-
tine youll be strung to the highest cot-
tonwood limb in the gulch when gold-
fork finds out youve murdered a woman
in cold blood

  ristines fingers coiled about his gun
stocks half lifted the fancy dragoons
from leather then he turned to zeno
malone his face drawn into a malevolent
mask

  my irons are empty he said huskily
extending his hand give me one of
yours

  malones bloodless lips pealed back
from his teeth as he passed one of his
colts butt-first to ristine the saloon-
keeper cocked the weapon hitching his
shoulders as if bracing himself for the
nasty chore that faced him

  hold it or ill riddle you ristine
the voice came from the opposite cor-
ner of the room like puppets jerked by
a common wire zeno malone and happy-
jack ristine whirled to stare at the ap-
parition which was emerging from be-
hind the opening door of the closet be-
yond the stove

  marshal jube kern crouched low to
avoid an overhead shelf laden with jars
of canned fruit was emerging from the
storage closet a cocked gun in either fist
the lamplight gleaming from the law
badge on his mackinaw

  kern stepped over a barricade of
stacked-up bullet-riddled books inside
the closet door and drew up to his full
height facing the bayed pair

  with a hoarse bawl of superstitious
terror zeno malone snapped the grip
of the trance which froze his muscles and
dropped his gun to the floor babbling
incoherently as he raised his arms before
the marshals drop

  staring through the gunsmoke at the
reincarnation of the foe he had blasted
into eternity a moment before happy-
jack ristine raised his gun and tripped
the hammer

  the saloonmans bullet aimed in panic
crashed into a stove-lid wide to the mar-
shals left before he could cut down
fr a second shot kern opened up with
both colts roaring in unison

  ristines frock-coated torso jolted un-
der the impact of converging lead but
he clung to his nerve and even as he
sagged to one knee he lifted his gun
once more

  with cold precision firing alternately
with left and right guns the marshal of
goldfork drilled his point-blank hail of
slugs into ristines toppling frame the
gamblers colt exploded once to drive
a shot into the floor at his feet

  then with blood spurting through his
black dundrearies and blemishing the
front of his flowered waistcoat the gun-
boss of goldfork pitched face downward
on the floor and lay still under a swaying
umbrella of gunpowder fumes

  vola colton opened her eyes in time
to see her father emerging from the gold
exchange office where he had carried
happyjack ristines mortal remains to
the black pine coffin kern had brought
from san francisco

  zeno malone handcuffed to a table
leg across the room watched the bankers
return with dull despair glazing his rab-
bit-like orbs gideon colton would be
the presiding judge at the miners court
which would mete out justice to the al-
bino on the morrow and already the feel
of hang-rope was a tangible thing on the
bartenders ivory-skinned throat

  then vola colton became aware of the
fact that her head was cradled in jube
kerns lap



j ube-how-how-

  her eyes left his to stray to the pile
of books stacked in jumbled disarray in-
side the open closet

  do you think id have ducked into
that closet if i hadnt been sure it wasnt
a death trap vola the marshal chuck-
led smoothing a stray curl off her damp
forehead i hunkered down behind that
double row of books you stored there
but protested the girl i dont un-
derstand

  even a buffalo gun cant shoot a slug
through twenty-four inches of solid pa-
per vola even a two-inch book will
turn a forty-five slug let alone a barri-
cade two feet thick it was like being
behind a stone wall

the girl struggled to her feet star-
ing at the blood-red puddle which
had leaked out of the closet

  but i saw blood

  it was gideon colton who supplied
the answer to that one returning from
his examination of the lead-punched pile
of the encyclopedia which had shielded
jube kern from ristines fusillade the
banker carried with him a smashed jar
from the upper shelf of the closet

  a quart of that wild raspberry juice
you canned last year vola colton
chuckled smashed to smithereens and
made a mess of that volume of shake-
speare you was so glad to get

  the banker set the shattered fragment
of the raspberry jar on the kitchen stove
and wiped the red stains from his fingers
then he turned to the cowering zeno
malone

  while im takin you over to the jail-
house zeno he told the bartender you
can tell me how you engineered that jail-
break for your boss i got a hunch saler-
atus burke wont linger around these
diggins much longer

  unlocking the albinos wrist irons
with kerns key gideon colton turned
his twinkling gaze at the marshal and his
daughter

  you two got plenty to talk over with-
out malone and me eavesdropping he
said with a grin i reckon goldfork
will tame down considerable when i go
over to the jackpot and tell those mexi-
can swampers to call for their boss it
aint every gun-boss who gets planted in
a two-hundred-dollar coffin eh malone

  his ranch the target of apache raiders jim casey puts up
  a rousing battle-and challenges the evil power of the el
  garito gun runners who supply arms to hostile tribesmen

chapter i

apache raid

with his range reaching to the
edge of the barrens outlaw and
apache country jim casey had
no protection from the law and little
from the army when the need arose
he and his three hired hands as tough a
quartet as could be found in the terri-
tory took it on themselves to defend the
stretch of rock and cactus bunchgrass
and catclaw casey used for a range rus-
tlers tested his defenses once or twice
to their sorrow then hunted softer nuts
to crack the apaches however were

a hardier breed every band that jumped
the reservation paid casey a visit

  perhaps caseys spread just happened
to be handy being so close to the wild
barrens or it may have been that the
paches had a taste for his beef and a
liking for his broncs whatever the
reason they came often at caseys
powder and lead were big items when
expenses were tallied

  other ranchers claimed casey was a
fool for having settled in such a loca-
tion and he was a stubborn man if hed
been taken by a notion to run cattle on
the off-side of hell hed probably have
done it but his irish good humor in-


	exciting

herited from his father whod come from
the old sod gradually turned sour his
temper grew short

  boys he finally told his crew im
going to do something about it

  that was the day a marauding band all
but wiped out the ranch   

  the apaches came from the north out
of the rocky wastes of the barrens it
was a bigger band than usual numbering
nearly forty warriors casey was in a
corral halter-breaking a paint mustang
when he saw a growing smudge of dust
out across the desert the traveling dust
cloud was warning enough casey fired
three shots into the air and his punchers
out on the range at a branding fire knew
the signal they came tearing in from
the south but for a moment or two it
seemed they wouldnt make it

  the race was close never ones to save
horseflesh the apaches were riding hard
casey had armed himself with a win-
chester and as the drumming of hoofs
turned to thunder he opened fire his
shots didnt slow the raiders but spread
them out-and they came on like a tidal
wave he emptied his rifle without mak-
ing a hit but by then his crew-pablo
young andy ketch old pete lawe-had
won the race they reined in blowing
broncs spilled from the saddle grabbed
out their six-guns

  inside casey yelled fast

  they forted up in the ranchhouse bar-
ring and barricading the only door as
the apaches came swirling up the
ranchhouse had been built for just such
a purpose its walls were of dobe and
nearly two feet thick its only windows
were narrow apertures one man to a
side the crew settled down to what
threatened to be a long fight casey fired
from his opening using the winchester
and saw on his third shot one of the
swarming raiders go down

it was bedlam a nightmare the
apaches circled the ranch buildings
yelling firing a yellow-white curtain
of dust shrouded them their ponies
were mostly half-tamed mustangs the
riders were naked except for one or two
who wore white mans shirts-a breech-
clout boot-like moccasins a red head
band and maybe a bandolier of car-
tridges such things served the apache
for clothing

  firing steadily casey could see the

western

gleaming bodies and dusky faces a
heaviness grew in him it was not fear
for long ago jim casey had convinced
himself that one way or another a man
could die only once but if it was not
fear in him it was hopelessness caseys
ranch was having one raid too many

  firing from his loophole pablo was
swearing softly in spanish at the rear
wall tow-headed young andy ketch
shouted with every shot old pete lawe
was silent as he emptied his six-gun
through a slit in the barred door the
ranchhouse grew hot as an oven and so
thick with powder-smoke the four de-
fenders began to cough the din rose
to a weird crescendo of hellish sound
then old petes voice cut through it
im hit-bad

  casey swung around took a step to-
ward the old-timer then he halted and
swore knowing by the way pete folded
as he collapsed that nothing could be
done pete lawe was dead

  it almost seemed that the apaches had
come for that purpose-to rob old pete
of his life for the yelling and firing
outside suddenly let up and when casey
turned back to his loophole he saw the
raiders riding off the sudden quiet was
jarring

  what ails them andy ketch mut-
tered they had us boxed

  ees a trick maybe pablo said si
a trick

  casey didnt say anything at once he
sagged against the wall rolled and light-
ed a smoke he looked at pete lawes
crumpled body and he looked away he
was a lean six-footer with a dark and
rocky but not unhandsome face he was
thirty-one years old and hed bought his
ranch with sweat and sacrifice a high
enough price casey now told himself
without it having cost old petes life
it was then as he waited to see if the
apaches had really gone or were up to
some trick that jim casey made up his
mind and said

 boys im going to do something
about it

  si jeem pablo said but what
aint nothing a hombre can do about
apaches andy ketch said

  im not talking about the apaches
casey said flatly but the reason for
their raiding im going to do something
about that

  the mexican and thetow-headed cow-
the indian ring	

poke exchanged a glance they didnt
know what casey meant

  i hear riders-la caballeria pablo
whispered both he and andy turned to
peer from their loopholes

  thats right-cavalry andy said
now i savvy why those pache devils
high-tailed it they knew the yellow-
legs were coming he crossed the room
told pablo to give him a hand with pete
lawes body they lifted the dead man
onto the bunk hed slept in for more than
a year andy then unbarred the door and
went out his voice lifted in a greeting
to the oncoming troopers pablo fol-
lowed him and jim casey after cover-
ing old pete with a blanket went after
them

  it was a troop of cavalry from camp
sand forty bay-mounted soldiers under
captain len barrett a dozen civilians
rode with the small blue-clad column
adding noise and confusion to the mili-
tary orderliness the troopers halted and
kept their ranks under a quietly spoken
order but the civilians a motley crew
coming from el garito near the army
post milled around and asked loud
questions

  this posse was led by frank averill
a burly man of thirty-five who wore
along with his townsmans clothes an air
of authority jim casey knew averill
well for five years before for a brief
period they had been partners in a
freighting business with an office and
wagonyard at tucson

  casey nodded

  howdy frank he said you chas-
ing apaches nowadays

  some of the boys were dead sot on
forming a posse

  and you came along for the ride

  i came along to see that they didnt
run wild

  there must be a profit in it you tak-
ing a hand casey said sourly and saw
averills heavy face grow dull red
well you wont catch that band by sit-
ting here theyve dusted

aptain barrett rode up dis-
mounted

 how many casey

  forty id say

i see they left five dead behind
we must have fired two three hun-
dred shots casey said not good
shooting theyd have had us if you

hadnt scared them off they got pete
lawe

  too bad the officer said he was a
pudgy man past the forty mark and he
looked tired-tired of the apaches of
the desert of the army his voice had
no color they jumped the reservation
early yesterday morning after killing
judd brant they must have holed up
in the barrens during the night

  whyd they kill brant casey said

  barrett shrugged why didnt they
kill brant long ago he was as crooked
an agent as ever was set up as a little
tin-god by the indian bureau he was
using the san marco agency to make
himself rich the apaches knew it
they got too much of him-at last

  why does the army let such men as
brant get away with it captain

  the army is one thing the indian
bureau another barrett said he
turned to his bay and mounted then
gave casey a thin smile a soldier isnt
supposed to reason why friend say
why dont you pull up stakes and find a
safer range

he didnt wait for an answer
with upraised arm he led his lit-
tle command out the troopers headed
southeast in the direction the fast-mov-
ing apaches had taken and the rattle of
their sabers and jingle of their accou-
trements made a pleasant music the
civilians rode after them

  one moment frank casey said

  frank averill reined in he still had
a sullen look and his dark eyes were
wary

  whats on your mind jim

  brant was a friend of yours wasnt
he

  i played cards and drank with him-
on occasion

  he wasnt the only man getting rich
because of the apaches casey said
you know frank this might be the be-
ginning of the end maybe a lot of
brants friends had better get from un-
der while theres still time thats a
friendly warning frank slong good
hunting

  he stepped back frank averill rode
off his face dark with anger and bewil-
derment casey turned to pablo and
andy ketch

  well bury pete he said then ive
got some riding to do
exciting western



chapter ii
gun runner

hey marked pete
lawes grave with a
cairn and then there
was nothing more
they could do for
him for a moment
afterward the three
of them stood there
with heads bared and
bowed-and each si-
lent with his own
thoughts then pab-
lo crossed himself
and young andy
muttered well petes gone

  but not forgotten jim casey said
they turned away casey to the cor-
ral where he roped a gelded dun for his
saddle and a little gray mare for his
pack the other two men perched atop
the fence smoked and watched casey
packed grub enough for a week he
packed a skillet and a coffee pot match-
es an axe a box of cartridges for his
rifle he made up his bedroll tied it to
the cantle of his saddle he went back
to the bunkhouse for his razor and some
soap ready now he paused to take a
quick look around he mounted the
dun caught up the mares halter rope

 boys i dont know when ill be
back he said as though suddenly re-
membering them he dug into the
pocket of his brush jacket payday
was last saturday so were about even
but heres your wages for this month
he handed each man his money
that means you can pull out if you
want he went on i wouldnt ask
the devil himself to stay on here after
a raid like that one this morning
therell be no hard feelings if you ride
out

  shucks boss youre coming back
aint you andy asked

  sure kid

  then well stay wont we pablo
the mexican flashed a gleaming smile
si he said well be here when you
get back jeem

casey nodded and smiled touched by
their loyalty then sobering he said
if i shouldnt get back in-say two
weeks youll know i ended up with a
bullet in my back in that case round

up the cattle and our saddle stock
drive them to el garito and sell for
what you can get-and the moneys
yours well thats it slong

  he headed out swinging north-to-
ward the barrens

  for two days jim casey prowled the
malpais without finding what he sought
he saw little evidence of other men in
that emptiness once he came upon the
ashes of a campfire that had been cold for
days and another time he found near a
waterhole an empty whisky bottle at
sundown of the second day he sighted
smoke he took cover until dark then
prowled through the rocks until he could
see the people around the campfire they
were indians-three men and a squaw
but not apaches casey did not know
what kind of indians they were he
silently withdrew

  the third morning however his luck
changed after eating and breaking
camp he headed east and a miles ride
brought him to the tracks of a wagon and
team caseys wide mouth formed a
twisted smile he followed the tracks
they were not very old

  the trail continued east toward the
morada mountains beyond which lay the
san marco indian reservation pushing
his horses casey brought the outfit into
sight when it was less than five miles
short of the moradas it was crawling
along the men with it apparently in no
hurry there were two of them casey
saw as he shortened the distance he
tied the pack mares lead rope to his
saddle horn then drew his winchester
from its boot and by then he was seen

 one of the men dropped down from
the wagon as the other reined in the
team the man on the ground kept his
hand on his holstered gun as casey rode
up and halted he was a half-breed
known as peso and he had pale blue eyes
that were an odd contrast to the darkness
of his face he had a reputation as being
a cold-blooded killer casey glanced at
the man on the wagon seat a tremen-
dously fat man with a flabby red face-
big weber casey looked back at the
breed the more dangerous of the two
but he spoke to the fat man

  heading for the moradas weber
  maybe

  thats pretty close to the apache
reservation

  is it big weber said shucks the
the indian ring



apaches dont bother me

  no i reckon not-so long as you run
whisky and guns to them

 who says i do that big weber
asked his voice still easy but his eyes
turning ugly the apaches buy other
kinds of trade goods

  youre taking a long way around to
sell lawful trade goods weber casey
said you mind if i look inside your
wagon

  i dont weber said but peso does
eh peso

 sure boss the breed said i
wouldnt like it

  whats it to you peso casey asked
youre just the hired man weber
brings you along because he cant savvy
apache talk keep out of it peso im
after big weber and nothings going to
stop me from getting him-good hes
been making a trip through the barrens
every month and i want to know for
sure what hes hauling

  let him take a look weber said
itll do him no good

casey shot a look at the fat man
knowing there was a trick in this
abrupt back-down but webers heavy
face was unreadable casey looked back
at peso the breed had taken his hand
away from his six-gun it looked all
right-almost casey gigged his dun
over to the wagon he tied his reins to-
gether then used his left hand to grab
hold of the tarpaulin covering the trade
goods

  now peso big weber said

  casey had expected something like
this he let go of the tarp flung up his
rifle just as peso made his draw rife
and six-gun blasted together and peso
uttered a strangling cry the breed
leaned forward leaned so far forward he
lost his balance he fell on his face
and didnt move again big weber
swore and lifted his arms showing empty
hands beads of sweat stood out on his
face

  i didnt figure you could do it casey
he said thickly no man ever took peso
before

  casey gestured with the rifle get out
your pocket gun weber-easy-like
thats it now throw it back over your
shoulder

 when that was done casey pulled
back the wagon tarp big weber was
hauling supplies and camp gear includ-

  ing a shovel which casey threw to the
ground

  dig weber he said you owe it to
peso to bury him he took the axe from
the mares pack and climbed onto the
wagon

  with a few quick blows he broke open
the cases of trade goods one case
held a dozen winchester rifles two
others contained cartridges the two
barrels he didnt touch knowing they
contained whisky of the cheapest kind
he climbed down from the wagon and
rolled a smoke he watched the fat man
sweat as he bent to the shovel

  when weber had finished filling in the
grave casey told him to climb to the
wagon seat and pull out weber had his
nerve back he tried to argue

  i dont know what your game is but
itll pay you better to string along with
me he said why buck something like
this casey itll only get you in trouble
im just the go-between if its not me
itll be somebody else

  talk some more weber

 money talks better casey name
your own price

  sure a dollar more than you can
pay

  webers face flushed a dark angry red
you fool he muttered thisll get you
nothing you take me to el garito and
my friends-

  were not going to el garito casey
told him im not that big a fool im
taking you straight to camp sand
that got big weber it seemed to
knock the breath out of him he tried
to say something but he uttered only
choking sounds a thin smile tugged at
jim caseys lips

  you know the apaches killed judd
brant he said first brant got it and
then peso now you weber its a good
start and i mean to see it through to the
finish

  what are you after casey

  you ever hear of what folks call the
indian ring

  talk big weber said too loudly
just talk

  youll change your tune at sand my
friend casey said drily youll squeal
then to save your own hide thats what
im after weber i want to hear what
you know about the ring i want you to
babble out some names when those sol-
diers at sand find out youve been selling
the apaches guns that have been killing
	exciting western

troopers oull get yours

 casey needed to say no more he
could see the desperation in big weber
and knew that before they reached the
military post panic would have hold of
the man

  lets go you fat son casey said
weve nearly sixty miles ahead of us
and no tricks on the way for id just as
soon shoot you as not you and every
other blackleg thats a member of the
ring get going weber get going
they kept going all through the blaz-
ing hot afternoon and at sundown had
reached the water-hole at black rock
on the eastern edge of the barrens
casey called a halt there to rest the
horses he ordered big weber to gather
some brush and build a fire then had him
cook a meal casey ate with relish for
he was pleased with the way things were
going weber however merely drank
some coffee and passed up the grub he
was a man without an appetite the
horses watered grained rested casey
rose at full dark

  thirty miles to go he said lets
get at em

  they headed on through the darkness
casey riding alongside the wagon and
keeping a wary eye on his prisoner he
felt that big weber wouldnt pull any-
thing but he wanted to be sure he was
deep in a death game against odds that
would mount and one slip-one un-
guarded moment-might be fatal big
weber had less to fear than jim casey
for the worst he faced was prison casey
began to suspect that he really was a fool
a wise man wouldnt buck a thing like
the indian ring

but he wasnt backing down he
brought big weber to camp sand
an hour after reveille when the new sun
was beginning to lay its scorching heat
across the parade ground casey and his
prisoner and his wagonload of evidence
were passed from sentry to sergeant to
officer of the day young lieutenant
nichols nodded stiffly listening to cas-
eys explanation

  well place the matter before major
hadley he said

  in headquarters building major had-
leys steely eyes gleamed with a sort of
wicked pleasure he was a bulky man
with iron-gray hair a veteran indian
fighter even though he was sands
commanding officer he was hamstrung

by rules and regulations the indian
bureau kept him from policing the
apache reservation and territorial poli-
ticians interfered with his attempts to
enforce the law upon renegade civilians
but big webers apprehension by jim
casey a reputable rancher was for had-
ley a stroke of luck

  so you caught him running guns and
whisky to the apaches

  thats it casey said hes been do-
ing it for months i got onto him be-
cause he always headed into the barrens
by crossing my range

  youre willing to go into court and
testify against him

  ive taken a hand in this major ill
play it through

  you know the risks youre taking
i know and they dont scare me any
casey said if the apaches are kept
armed and stirred up theyll get me
sooner or later i may as well take my
chances against weber and his com-
padres i brought him here in the hope
that you army people could make him
talk weber admits hes only the go-
between he was hauling those guns for
somebody else

  hadley scowled at big weber

  im placing you in the guardhouse
while i send to tucson for the united
states marshal he said youre headed
for yuma prison sure but by turning
government evidence you can lighten
your sentence you ready to talk
weber

  if i talk im a dead man weber said
thiqkly i wouldnt be safe even in
prison ive got my rights i want to
send to el garito for judge ben
hajilon

  hanlons no judge

hes a lawyer ive a right to counsel
youre pretty shrewd my friend
hadley said he looked at jim casey
how did you figure we could make him
talk

  i figured hed break down casey re-
plied but hes got his nerve back tell
you what major-you let me take him
outside the post you can send some men
after him telling them hes an escaped
prisoner nobody can blame soldiers for
shooting an escaped gun-runner

  it was a bluff on caseys part but it
worked

  you cant do that weber said
jumpily itd be murder

  casey grabbed him by the arm lets
the indian rino



go weber he said

  the fat man broke yelling wait ill
talk his breathing was labored and
he trembled frank averill furnished
me with the guns and whisky out of his
store in el garito i swear it

  hes a big man in the ring casey
demanded

  one of the biggest weber said still
talking under the pressure of his fear
he owns el garito body and soul that
indian agent brant was in cahoots with
him and judge hanlon figures out a lot
of the deals the ring pulls then theres
cly bateman the contractor
batemans the man who built the
schoolhouse at the san marco agency
casey said theres been talk that it
cost six thousand to build but the in-
dian bureau paid out thirty thousand
for it

  thats right weber muttered the
ring made twenty-four thousand dollars
on the deal judd brant got a cut out of
it so did judge hanlon and frank
averill but bateman got the biggest
share

  well thats a start casey said
lock him up hadley

 the officer nodded to lieutenant
nichols and big weber was led away to
the guardhouse major hadley rose and
offered jim casey his hand

  the army is grateful sir he said
too often civilians are hostile to the
service and thats what makes things
difficult

  whats the next step casey asked
ill send a rider to the united states
marshal hadley told him the army
cant prosecute a civilian itll be up to
the marshal to make use of webers testi-
mony he paused frowning theres
one trouble weber is liable to clam up
once hes turned over to the law he
may deny he talked at all

  i was thinking that casey said
but if we had some more evidence we
could smash the ring

  ive not been overlooking the ring
hadley said in fact ive used some of
my command-both officers and enlisted
men-in an attempt to gather evidence
so far its failed

  then its up to me sir

 you casey one man against the
ring

  id like to see it through

  youll be taking big risks hadley
said but youd be doing the whole

territory a great service he smiled
thinly ill not try to change your mind
if you get into trouble and can send
word to me ill rush the whole garrison
to give you a hand

  casey grinned thanks maybe to-
gether we can smash the ring and wipe
out el garito-at the same time

chapter iii

cashiered lieutenant

im casey left head-
quarters cut across
the parade ground to
the sutlers store to
buy some smoking to-
bacco when he came
from the store he
paused to roll a
smoke the garrison
was gathering on the
parade ground the
sutler came out

  this is something
to see pardner he

said

  whats up

  theyre going to drum a soldier out
of the regiment the sutler said and
spat an officer he got into some kind
of trouble over at el garito last week
took part in a drunken brawl the way
i heard it shamed the army now hes
to be disgraced loco the army

  casey had no desire to see any man
disgraced for some mistake made under
the influence of drink yet he remained
he stayed and watched without knowing
why he did so

  he saw the entire garrison assemble
as on dress parade several women
watched from the dobes that made up
officers row a couple more civilians
gathered at the sutlers store and half a
dozen tame indians gazed upon the scene
with faces blank and eyes puzzled the
colors hung lifelessly from its high pole
the sun blazed down the prisoner in
full uniform was brought from the
guardhouse casey saw he was a lieu-
tenant a blond young man he was
flanked by two sergeants the three
halted at attention before the ranks

  casey frowned and rolled another
smoke

  an officer read aloud and monoto-
nously from a paper when he was fin-
ished he stepped forward and relieved
exciting western



the prisoner of his saber using the
blade he cut buttons and insignia from
the prisoners tunic the mans hat was
removed a sergeant stepped forward
with barbering tools and one half the
prisoners head was shaved drums be-
gan to roll drearily a bugle sounded
and the bleak tune of the rogues
march lifted beside jim casey the
sutler chanted softly

  poor old soldier-tarred and feath-
ered sent to blazes

  the disgraced man was marched before
the ranks of stiff-faced men and officers
the drums continued until he was
escorted to the extreme edge of the post
where a saddled mount awaited him it
was over then

  casey mounted his dun rode out lead-
ing his pack mare he took the road to
el garito and soon overtook the ex-
officer the man was afoot leading his
gray horse and he was staring at the
ground he did not look up as casey
dismounted and walked beside him they
went on like that for a hot and dusty
mile

  ive got a ranch up north close to the
barrens casey said i lost a hand to
the apaches a couple days back

  the man looked up his lean face held
expressionless by sheer will he was
young boyish you offering me a job
at forty a month and found

  i dont know anything about ranch-
ing

  youll learn

  maybe you didnt see what happened
back there

  maybe i saw casey said but i sure
dont know-or care-why it happened
do you want the job

  it took the man a long time to answer
ill think it over he said finally
youre jim casey arent you my
names dan colby his voice turned
bitter before you offer to hire a man
you should learn something about him
i got into a jam at el garito a week ago
i played the fool nowadays a man can
get drummed out of the army for getting
drunk but i wasnt drunk a little
crazy i guess but not drunk

  well youre not the first man to make
a mistake

  it wasnt a mistake dan colby said
angrily i knew what i was doing and
id thought it out beforehand it
seemed that he needed to ease some of
the pressure within him and by talking

found that relief i was on patrol with
b troop about a month ago when
some of the san marco apaches jumped
the reservation to join up with geronimo
we ran into an ambush and lost seven
men

  i heard about it casey said

  we killed some of the apaches and
captured half a dozen brand-new win-
chester rifles that was something i
couldnt forget-those rifles

  so you worried about it casey said
then a week ago when you couldnt
stand it any longer you went to el
garito and accused somebody there of
running guns to the apaches who was
it you accused

  frank averill

  why him

the ex-army officer scowled with
anger at the memory of his wrongs
he owns the biggest store in that
hell-hole of a town colby said averill
denied he was selling guns to anybody
but white men i called him a liar i
guess i lost my head anyway i
knocked him down and searched his
store the only guns i found were the
ones on display-a dozen rifles and about
two dozen pistols but id gamble
averills got plenty of good rifles stored
somewhere

  so you got drummed out of the army
just for flooring frank averill casey
said or did you do something more
i went over to the silver bell and had
a drink colby went on a couple of
drinks i was there for a couple hours
i guess one of the percentage girls
hung around finally she whispered
something about knowing something the
army should know-something about
guns i was a fool i should have known
it was a trap but i let her take me up-
stairs so we could talk in private as she
said

  once we got in her room she tore
her dress and mussed up her hair and
started screaming everybody in the
place came running the men grabbed
me dragged me outside i dont know
what would have happened if some of the
troopers hadnt been in town and saved
me from the crowd

  so you were framed because you
bucked frank averill

  thats it and i couldnt prove it was
a frame-up

  what do you figure on doing now
the indian ring	

  i dont know colby said tonelessly
a mans chances arent much good after
being drummed out of the army maybe
ill take that job with you he laughed
hollowly or maybe ill join up with
the indian ring there should be room
for a man whos been disgraced

  he fell silent and casey made no com-
ment they kept on like that walking
and leading their horses casey was toy-
ing with an idea the indian ring was
not an organization rather it was
merely a name given to a certain element
that sought to profit by having the
apaches raid throughout the territory

  such a ring existed near every big
indian reservation but here at el garito
which was close to the san marco
agency it was bolder than most the
town had been founded by men like
frank averill judge ben hanlon and
the building contractor cly bateman
the majority of whom had left cali-
fornia nevada or new mexico because
of trouble with the law those states
were making things too hot for such men
but the territory gave them sanctuary

  but the shrewdest among the members
of the ring knew that arizona would
remain wide open and profitable to them
only so long as it remained in a state of
unrest with the apaches kept armed
and troublesome settlers would stay
away ranchers would be kept busy
guarding their range and herds and the
army would have its hands full trying
to hold apaches in check paradoxically
the indian ring even profited from the
army

  frank averills store supplied camp
sand with provisions another el garito
firm furnished grain and hay for the
army mounts a cattle dealer sold beef
to the san marco agency for the
apaches as well as to the post garrison
and el garitos saloons and honky-tonks
took the pay from the troopers breeches
it was a vicious circle the indian ring

 while the more cunning members
swindled the indian bureau provisioned
the army armed and liquored the
apaches the other under its protection
worked out of el garito at robbing stages
and holding up trains rustling and steal-
ing horses preying upon miners from
bisbee to tombstone seldom did the
us marshal busy with other law-break-
ing centers get to el garito and the
army could not take over civilian law
enforcement

so much ran through jim caseys
mind colby maybe you heard
that i brought in big weber after catch-
ing him running guns to the apaches
he said

  i heard

  like you id like to smash the ring
casey went on ive been thinking we
could work together im going into el
garito to find out what i can nobody
there knows yet that i jumped big
weber so ill have no trouble-for a
time at least and if you play it right
now that youve been drummed out you
may be able to take up with the ring
and learn something

 how could i work it dan colby
asked so that crowd wont be suspi-
cious

  thats easy enough casey told him
make a show of getting drunk start
beefing about the deal the army gave
you and wait for something to happen
they halted and faced one another you
game amigo

  sure said dan colby ive got
nothing to lose now

  only your life casey told him
shall we shake on it

  they did

  they parted dan colby mounted and
kept to the road while casey also
mounting left the road and headed out
across the desert it seemed wiser un-
der the circumstances for each to enter
el garito alone casey circled around
so that he could reach the town from the
north thus making it appear he had
arrived straight from his ranch he
waited until dark to ride in

  el garito was a one-street town some
of its buildings adobe and some unpaint-
ed frame a small portion of its citizens
were mexicans and they were law-
abiding enough but the majority were
men on the shady side of the law and
the sort of women who followed such
men el garito boasted no family
homes except the few mexican dobes

  there was a two-storied hotel the
trail house and it was home to some
of the citizens others holed up in dobe
huts or frame shacks or had rooms over
the saloons there were a dozen saloons
ranging from a big honky-tonk the sil-
ver bell down to a hole-in-the-wall bar

  frank averills store was the biggest
building it being combined with a ware-
house next to averills place was a lum-
ber yard its office bore a sign reading
	exciting

cly bateman building supplies  con-
tracting beyond was a grubby restau-
rant judge ben hanlons office was
above the restaurant there were saddle
mounts racked all along the crooked
street

  casey dismounted at joe smalls livery
barn and turned his horses over to the
mexican hostler

  take good care of them he said and
tossed the mexican a silver dollar did
that posse come back from chasing the
apaches

  si senor those hombres chased for
only two days

  casey nodded and walked off down the
street averills store was lamplighted
and a clerk was moving about inside
reaching the silver bell casey shoul-
dered through the swing doors a piano
was being drummed and a mexican
youth was strumming a guitar some
men were dancing with the girls the
gambling tables were busy as was the
long bar dan colby was at the bar
talking loudly and drunkenly to judge
ben hanlon the dark-faced lawyer was
listening sympathetically

  half a dozen ranchers and at least
a dozen cowpunchers were present
forming a circle of their own but most
of the crowd were men who put up at
el garito casey stopped at the bar
for a drink and saw frank averill at a
corner table with cly bateman the
contractor a girl with bleached hair
and a mechanical smile came up to casey
but he shook his head and said not
tonight sweetheart he was watching
dan colby and judge hanlon those
two had left the bar and were going to
join averill and bateman colby was
unsteady on his feet either drunk or
pretending to be

  once judge hanlon got colby seated
the four men now at the table put their
heads together

  the swing doors opened to admit a
newcomer and casey was gripped by a
sudden frozen feeling the newcomer
was the bald little sutler from camp
sand luke wyman he bustled into
the center of the wide room his eyes
searching the place for someone he
looked like a man carrying news and
casey knew the only news luke wy-
man could have was that of big webers
arrest

  casey shoved away from the bar mov-
ing fast

chapter iv

raid for evidence

fyman was headed for
  the corner table and
  had just called out
  frank - mr aver-
  ill when casey
  reached him casey
  blocked wymans
  way pinning him be-
  tween two deal tables

  outside l u k e
  casey said move
  fast and keep your
  mouth shut

 wyman blinked
watery eyes ive got a right to talk
to mr averill he said with diminish-
ing conviction get out of my way
caseys right fist moved no more than
three inches but it folded the little
man over and forced gasping sounds
from his throat casey caught hold of
him spun him about and walked him
as he would have walked a drunk from
the silver bell he had luke wyman
on the street before the man had recov-
ered his breath a spring wagon stood
nearby

  your rig luke

  yes blast you

  climb into it and get out fast casey
said go back to camp sand and stay
there if you show up here again ill
get rough

  listen casey ive got to talk to
frank averill

  forget it luke forget it and get
out

  no dont forget it luke frank av-
erills voice said maybe its important
whatd you know thats got casey so
worried

  he let the batwings close behind him
sver so slowly and strolled to the edge
of the saloon porch he towered there
puffing on a cigar dark eyes question-
ing-a little worried averill was heavy
for a man of his age a bit flabby but
he was handsome enough and he had
the air of a prosperous merchant he
gestured now

  all right luke-talk

 casey drew his six-gun he had
bluffed big weber and he might be
able to run a bluff on this pale shadow
of a man luke wyman

luke ill bet you wont get more
the indian ring



than two words out he said you
figure its worth it

  hes bluffing luke averill said
call him but luke wyman wasnt
sure he shrank back-one step a sec-
ond a third-then he suddenly whirled
and made for his wagon and team he
got the team started using the whip and
headed out of el garito casey chuckled

  too bad when a man hasnt any cour-
age frank

  thats right jim but sometimes a
man has too much courage

 meaning me

  thats right averill said he tossed
away his cigar came down from the
porch im going to the livery barn for
a horse and im going to ride after that
timid fool you going to try to stop
me

 casey shook his head not yet
frank he said and watched the big
man walk off toward smalls livery he
was still looking after him when a wom-
ans voice called his name it was one
of the silver bells girls dark-haired
maria casey new her from other trips
to el garito perhaps because she had
always gone out of her way to make
friendly overtures toward him now
maria ave him a flirtatious smile over
her shoulder and strolled along the
bells porch at the far end she stepped
down and vanished into the alleyway be-
tween the saloon and the neighboring
building casey rolled and lighted a
smoke then went after her

 maria

  jim keep your voice low the girl
said and came so close he was tantalized
by a faint breath of perfume

  jim theres danger she whispered
frank averill and some others are out
to get you

 how do you know

  averill saw you ride in tonight he
passed the word to judge hanlon and
cly bateman then he came to me ma-
ria paused caught hold of caseys arm
he figured youd come to see me be-
cause you did other times he told me
to try to find out what youre up to
and you decided to tip me off

  i like you casey ive always been
fond of you

  well im obliged to you casey said
he could feel her pressing lightly
against him he put his arm about her
and held her tight maria was a pretty
girl likable and now-this youre not

worried about me a girl like you knows
the world if full of men

  thats a rotten thing to say to me
after i give you a friendly warning

  sorry darling where can i see you
later

  i dont know if i want to see you
now

  you want to help me dont you
casey said look honey i know where
your room is stay awake tonight and
close to your window i may call you to
do something for me if the going gets
tough now go back inside and slip
word to dan colby that i want to see
him here

it was several minutes before colby
came lurching out like a drunk casey
noted two minor occurrences in the
street frank averill rode out of the
livery barn and away from town and at
averills store across the street the
late-working clerk came out locked the
door and departed he had left a single
lamp its wick turned low burning in
the far rear of the store

  whats up casey dan colby said
his voice was excited but he wasnt
drunk

  averill rode out of town casey
whispered this is a good time to make
a search of his place for rifles you
want to risk it

  lets go the younger man said

  they crossed the street ducked into
the alleyway between the store and the
lumber yard the side of the store build-
ing was without doors or windows but
at the rear there were both the door
was a wide one to admit large cases of
merchandise it was locked the win-
dow too was secured by a peg or a nail
so casey took off his brush jacket and
held it over one of the small panes the
jacket deadened the sound when he
smashed the pane with the butt of his
six-gun he reached in through the op-
ening fumbled about removed the nail
that locked the sash and a minute later
both men were inside

  you searched the place so theres no
use looking in the obvious places again
casey told dan colby theres no
second story and theres no side rooms
except averills office you look in
there

  colby nodded theres only a desk
and a small bafe

  lets take a look casey said
	exciting western

  once in the little office he walked
heavily back and forth testing the floor
with his boot heels it rang hollowly

  theres a cellar and theres a trap
door in the corner casey said

  a chair stood upon the trap door
casey removed it and lifted the trap
he had to strike a match to see down
into the cellar and its flickering glow
revealed a ladder casey went down
his match burned out and he struck an-
other he saw a large room filled with
cases marked winchester and some
were the long flat ones that were used to
ship repeating rifles the others con-
tained ammunition casey went back
up the ladder

  weve found his cache casey said
there must be five hundred rifles down
there and ten thousand rounds of am-
munition

  whatll we do now

  get out of here casey said closing
the trap and replacing the chair and
pay a visit to cly batemans lumber
yard

  they didnt need to smash a window to
enter the lumber-yards office the lock
on the door of the box-sized building
was wobbly and it gave when casey
flung his weight against the flimsy door
the office was dark and since it fronted
on the street casey could risk no light
he felt his way about going through
cly batemans rolltop desk its cubby-
holes were crammed with all sorts of
papers and business letters but casey
knew that such documents were worth-
less as evidence that bateman was a
member of the indian ring and a swin-
dler so he passed them up

  the stuff we need casey whispered
would be locked up or hidden some
place bateman must keep some records
of his crooked deals

  colby was prowling about in the dark
heres a picture on the wall he mut-
tered maybe- here it is casey a
little cupboard in the wall

  anything in it

  some money some papers and a
small ledger

  well we dont want his money
casey said drily

  they left batemans office taking with
them the papers and the ledger casey
told dan colby to pocket the stuff col-
by was a little worried you sure the
law will make use of stolen evidence
whos going to prove its stolen

casey said well give this to major
hadley and he can turn it over to the
u s marshal and nobody can accuse
hadley of burglarizing these places
you going to camp sand now
not yet casey said judge ben
hanlon is one of the biggest sharpers
in the ring and i want to get something
on him

  judge hanlon had his law office and
living quarters on the second floor of
the building that housed the frisco
cafe an open stairway at the side led
up to his door and the door was un-
locked the front room was the office
and it smelled of stale tobacco smoke
and whisky a broad table served as a
desk there was a book case full of law
tomes and there was a safe-locked
casey had drawn the window shades
and lighted the oil lamp no papers or
letters or ledgers were in evidence

  a lawyers too smart casey said
and itd take dynamite to open that
safe

  casey i hear something-sure dan
colby said

casey heard something too he
blew out the lamp flame drew his
six-gun and waited somebody was
climbing the outside stairs the door
opened a man stepped in and the door
closed a match was struck flickered
and casey saw judge hanlons heavy
florid face the lawyer moved to the
table reached out for the lamp shade
he felt the warmth of the shade and a
grunt escaped him he dropped the
match whirled about casey stepped in
front of the door

  keep still and quiet judge he said
ive got you covered

 who are you hanlon demanded
there was uneasiness in his deep voice
but no fear what do you want
open your safe judge

  ive got no money in there

  open it anyway well take a look
all right but ive got to have some
light to work the dial

  use a match hanlon and keep your
face to the safe casey said if you
should happen to see me ajid my pard
its the last thing youll ever see

  all right hanlon said and turned
to the safe he knelt before it and casey
was worried this is too easy he told
himself and stepped over behind the law-
yer just as hanlon grabbed a derringer
the indian ring	

from inside his coat and swung around
casey struck down with the butt of his
six-gun hard against hanlons head the
derringer roared as the pudgy man
slumped down casey was not hit but
he cursed this turn in his luck

  clear out dan he said the whole
townll be roused and were liable to
make lynch-rope bait

chapter v
grim search

       rtet they got safely
       j down from hanlons
     	place before the men

i who had poured into
 i the street made up
their minds as to
where the gunshot
i had been fired casey
shoved his partner to-
ward the rear of the
building and they
ilwrxmil  managed to lose them-
selves in the darkness
before judge hanlon

started shouting

 they made their way to the livery
barn the mexican was staring down-
street where a big crowd was milling
about hanlon was loudly saying that a
couple of hardcases had tried to rob and
murder him

  dan im going to take that stuff to
camp sand casey said dan colby
handed cly batemans papers and ledger
over to him you better go back to pre-
tendin youre drunk

  ill see you again casey

 sure come up to my ranch

 they shook hands and parted dan
colby staggering down the street to join
the excited crowd casey went over to
the mexican youth gave him two more
silver dollars

  saddle up my horses amigo and keep
quiet the boy stared hard then
grinned and nodded

 casey watched from the deep shadows
alongside the barn he saw a rider come
loping into town from the camp sand
road and it was the burly frank aver-
ill evidently averill had overtaken
and had a talk with luke wyman and
learned that casey had brought big
weber in from the barrens averill
reined in

 what happened he demanded

  the crowd fell silent to let judge
hanlon answer in his resounding court-
room voice hanlon told about his en-
counter with two hold-up men

  averill muttered an oath those two
werent after your money ben he said
loudly they were after your papers
and one of them was jim casey he
brought big weber in from the barrens
and turned him over to the army web-
ers being held for gun-running ive got
a good notion that the hombre with ca-
sey was that lieutenant who got drummed
out of sand today luke wyman saw
casey and dan colby together on the
road after they left camp sand

 theres dan colby now but hes
drunk somebody yelled

  drunk or sober grab him averill
yelled

  casey groaned for dan colby threw
off his pretense of drunkenness he
grabbed out his six-gun and started yell-
ing back at averill

  sure i was with casey he shouted
we didnt get hanlons papers but we
did get cly batemans and we found
where you cache your trade rifles aver-
ill caseys on his way to sand now and
youre done tinhorn the whole rotten
indian rings done for i swore id get
you

  a gun roared once twice and a third
time and the life was ripped out of
young dan colby casey had taken a
step from his hiding-place with gun in
hand but there had been no chance of
siding the hot-headed ex-army officer
dan colby had fired no shots but he had
had a gun in his hand-and frank aver-
ill could maintain that he had fired in
self-defense for it had been averill
who had cut colby down

  get his carcass off the street some of
you hombres averill said

 casey drew back into the shadows
again bitter over his inability to have
helped dan colby all he could do now
was to mutter a promise under his breath
ill square it for you dan somehow
he whispered then he was attentive
again frank averill was haranguing the
crowd

  casey didnt pass me on the road to
sand so he must still be here in town
he said spread but and find him boys
and ill give a thousand dollars to the
man who puts a bullet into him

  casey took to his heels with this hue
and cry being raised there was no time
exciting western



for him to wait for his horses he kept
to thfc back of the buildings until he
reached the silver bell then plunged
into the dark and narrow alleyway along-
side the honky-tonk the alley was lit-
tered with rubbish from the bell and
casey found an empty whisky barrel he
up-ended it beneath the window of ma-
rias room climbed upon it and by jump-
ing he caught hold of the sill the win-
dow was open

  casey maria said softly

  casey strained and broke out in a
sweat he could get no foothold so his
arms took the full burden of pulling his
weight up the search was drawing
close as maria caught him first by the
shoulders and then by the belt and
helped drag him over the sill he spilled
into the dark room and lay gasping while
men searched through the alleyway be-
low when the searchers went on to the
rear casey picked himself up the girl
wanted to come into his arms he held
her off

  listen to me maria he said whis-
pering it i want you to go to camp
sand as soon as you can and give these
papers and this book to major hadley
and tell him i said frank averill has an
arms cache trade guns in a cellar under
his office you got it

  the girl didnt answer immediately
he could sense her disappointment she
had been waiting for him there in the
dark but not to be sent on an errand

  all right she said huskily at last
but whats in it for me youre asking
me to cross up my own kind of people
so whats in it for me

  anything you want of me maria
casey said if i get out of this
youre not going to get out of it are
you casey

  no i guess not

  would major hadley send help if he
knew this town was out to kill you
he made me a sort of promise casey
said

  maria was silent a moment gazing at
him in the gloom i guess im just a
fool for you casey i guess ive been a
fool since the first time i saw you a year
ago even though i knew you never gave
me a thought after going back to your
ranch casey im going now

  not now maria tomorrow when its
safe

  tomorrow youll be dead if i dont
get help now maria said dont worry

about me casey i can get out of this
town anytime

  she leaned toward him and her lips
brushed caseys cheek then she was
moving away from him the door of the
little room opened and closed and the
girl was gone casey stood there in the
dark full of disturbing thoughts he
could hear the search for him boiling
around the town once a couple of guns
opened up somewhere finally the
searchers came into the silver bell up
to the little rooms occupied by the
honky-tonk girls

  casey went out the window once on
the ground he decided to leave town
afoot it seemed that the wolf pack
wouldnt guess that a man might take to
the desert without a mount but almost
at once casey saw that was no good
somebody no doubt frank averill had
out-guessed him riders were circling
the town out there in the darkness pan-
ic gripped jim casey not for himself
but for the girl maria

  if shes caught with those papers on
her shes done he thought and tried
not to think about it

  crouched there in the dark alley with
gun in hand listening to the shouts of
the searchers casey racked his brain
trying to figure out a hiding-place that
frank averill and his bounty-crazed
hunters would overlook some of them
were ransacking the silver bell at this
very moment others were going through
the other saloons every place in el ga-
rito down to the smallest mex dobe
would be searched all casey suddenly
thought but one there was a chance
that frank averill would not guess that
his own store was a sanctuary for his
quarry

  to reach averills place casey had to
cross the street he did so by walking
boldly openly directly from the silver
bell there were men on the bells
porch there was a big crowd up by joe
smalls livery barn where caseys horses
must have been discovered other men
mostly in groups were ranged the length
of el garitos crooked street surely
some of them saw jim casey make his
crossing but in the darkness and per-
haps because of his boldness he wasnt
recognized he breathed easier once he
was between store and lumber yard and
he was smiling crookedly once he
reached the stores rear and once more
entered by the window
the indian ring	

  the lamp the clerk had left burning
had been turned higher no doubt by
frank averill when he entered the store
to see if dan colby had spoken the truth
about having found the arms cache ca-
sey let the lamp burn brightly he turned
into the little office into which some of
the lamplight leaked and saw that the
chair had been removed from the trap-
door averill had sought to convince
himself sighing wearily casey seated
himself and rolled a smoke he could
still hear men prowling about outside

  he tried not to think of his own plight
considered instead dan colby who had
been disgraced yet had died as coura-
geously as any soldier and casey
thought of his ranch up there on the
edge of the barrens for he loved the
place as a man can only love a home hed
fought for he told himself wryly that
andy ketch and pablo would soon con-
sider him dead and they wouldnt be
wrong casey sat there relishing a quirly
smoke but he was a dead man

  no not quite a dead man for his pulse
suddenly quickened he had thought of
maria hed never heard her other name
but he could remember now the warm
softness of her arms eager for him and
in his mind he could see her smile and
the way her eyes always lighted up at
sight of him she had done his bidding
dangerous though it was without hoping
to gain anything for herself but what
was it the marias of this world wanted
a man to love casey didnt know he
wished he might ask maria

  an hour passed and casey dozed a bit
then he had another smoke he could
hear nothing from outside now and that
silence made him smile frank averill
had halted the noisy man-hunt and now
was trying some trick to flush his quarry
into the open sit tight casey he sat
there in averills office and smoked his
quirly down until it threatened to
scorch his lips then he heard a new
racket in the street

  there was a drumming of many hoofs
men shouted and guns blasted casey
left his chair hurried from the office he
moved from one display of merchandise
to another until he reached the front
window one glance was enough cav-
alry from camp sand was in el garito
and some crazy fools were firing upon
the troopers but cavalry carbines were
returning the fire hell had broken out
in el garito

  something happened behind casey at
the rear of the long crowded room he
whirled around and saw frank averill
the big man had entered by the rear
door and now was taking the one lighted
lamp down from its wall bracket not
having seen casey averill went into his
office casey drew his six-gun and went
after him

  when he reached the office door he
saw that averill had the trap door open
the man flung the burning lamp down
into the gun cache there was a small
explosion a puff of smoke and flames
leapt from the trap averill stood there
watching the red glow from below
bright upon his face

  destroying the evidence frank
casey said and your entire store along
with it shucks man that must hurt

averill whirled about his right
hand going beneath his coat his
heavy face was contorted with rage and
shock but seeing caseys gun he did not
draw his own weapon

  blast you casey he muttered you
sneaking coyote

  frank you always were a blackleg
casey said five years ago when we
were operating that freighting line as
partners you cheated me out of most of
the profits but this is a dirtier game
what do you want casey

  ive got what i want frank casey
said hear all that shooting the
indian ring is being smashed and thats
what i want some fool put those other
fools up to firing on the cavalry and
thats too bad frank i saw you kill dan
colby he was a decent sort

  averill said nothing flames were
leaping high out of the trap behind him
he still had his hand on his gun

  i guess youll hang for killing colby
frank casey went on unless you
want to shoot it out with me-which id
kind of like

  have it your way casey averill
said and drew casey let him get his
gun clear of its holster then he swung
his own six-gun up and shot him as
averill had shot dan colby-three 
slugs aimed at the heart

  averills one shot went wild and
casey after the man lay sprawled
stepped over him and slammed the trap
door with it closed and the air shut
off the fire should die out outside the
shooting was letting up the indian

and struck rawley heavily across the
head with his six-shooter

too smart for his own good

by andrew bronson

  the bandit is bold when he robs the bar si payroll-but buck
  rawley is still bolder when he battles to get the money back

a full moon hung above the tow-
ering peaks to the eastward its
pale light serving to accentuate
the darkness of the shadows all around
buck rawley as he rode warily along the
trail one hand close to the gun on his
left hip the night was quiet the only
sounds rawley heard were the soft
drumming of the bays hoofs on the hard-
packed dirt of the road and the creaking
of his saddle leather

i dont like it rawley muttered
thinking of the payroll its too blasted

quiet to seem natural

  the uneasiness that had crept over
him as he rode away from the town just
as it was growing dark was still with
him his gaze constantly searched the
shadows this was dangerous country
for a man carrying a ranch payroll to
ride through after dark

  ahead the trail started upward wan-
dering higher and higher finally curving
around the upper part of a cliff wall
huge boulders were scattered about at
the start of the rise the horse snorted

 
exciting western



as he approached the big rocks

  rawley had thought he was ready for
trouble yet when it came it appeared
so quietly that he was taken unaware
one moment he was guiding the bay
along the trail through the rock and
the next there was another horseman
riding silently beside him

  it was a big man on a black horse who
rode now on rawleys right his saddle
leather did not creak and rawley was
not certain he could hear the hoofbeats
of the black mingling with those of the
bay there was something eerie ghost-
like about the horseman who had come
out of the shadows

  who are you rawley asked finally
fingers on the butt of his gun as he
peered at the face of the man beside
him what do yuh want

  it seemed a long time before the an-
swer came the horses went on up the
trail relief swept over rawley as he
found he could distinguish the beat of
the blacks hoofs from that of his own
mount at least the strange riders horse
was real

  im dart fenton the big mans
voice was low and strangely musical as
he finally spoke seein as yore knowin
my name wont ever matter he looked
at the big young dark haired waddy on
his right you might tell me who yuh
are sos i can notify folks after youre
dead

  buck rawley rawleys tone was
equally quiet and yuh dont need to
worry fenton i aint aiming to die
for a while

  none of us aim to do that fenton
said but it happens sometimes the
big man shook his head sadly specially
when im around yuh know i got an
idea im plumb unlucky to some people
there was a strange note in dart fen-
tons tone as though he actually consid-
ered himself a sinister emissary of fate
and regretted it a strange man and in
rawleys estimation an extremely dan-
gerous one

the horses climbed steadily until
they reached the place where the
trail circled around the face of the cliff
here it was still wide enough for the two
men to continue riding side by side

  you tell it scary rawley said but
i dont frighten easy why do you figger
im going to die

  because im goin to kill you said

fenton dispassionately i happen to be
a hombre whos cursed with the love of
money i saw yuh draw a large amount
of cash out of the bank in red gulch
this afternoon and i want that dinero

  rawleys fingers tightened on his gun
ready for the big man to draw but fen-
tons actions were as startling as they
were unexpected the two men were rid-
ing close together fenton reached out
and jabbed rawley in the right ankle
with a spur the pain was so sharp that
rawley flinched instinctively jerking
his foot out of the stirrup

  fenton thrust his own foot into the
empty stirrup caught the horn of raw-
leys saddle and swung himself onto the
waddys horse the bay bumped hard
against the black as the two horses grew
frightened and started to run suddenly
the black lost his footing plunged over
the edge of the ledge and went crashing
down through the branches of thick
brush below

  got yuh now fenton growled and
his voice was no longer boft or musical
this is yore finish

 he had his gun in his hand he
brought the barrel crashing down on
rawleys head blackness swept over
rawley as he lapsed into unconscious-
ness fenton tossed the limp form off
the horse and watched rawley land on
the rim trail and sprawl there motionless
then fenton searched and found the
payroll money in a saddle-pocket on the
bay

  thats that fenton said frowning
too bad it had to happen the way it
did i kind of liked that jasper then
he settled himself in the saddle and
rode away

  gradually the hoofbeats of the bay died
away in a few moments he was gone
the still form of buck rawley sprawled
there motionless in the moonlight   

  it was just after sunrise the next
morning that buck rawley rode into the
bar m ranch on a black horse both horse
and rider looked like they had been
through some mighty tough going old
bill martin owner of the bar m came
out on the porch of the ranchhouse as
rawley halted the black near the steps
the waddy got stiffly out of the saddle
and came up on the porch

 change yore mind martin asked
his blue eyes cold as he gazed at the
waddy figgered yuh would be far
away by this time rawley
too smart for

 meaning what rawley asked

 yore bay hoss wandered in late last
night with the saddle empty said the
boss of the bar m we thought some-
thin had happened to you until we found
the note fastened to the saddle tied
there by a latigo string

 what note demanded rawley

 martin reached into a pocket of his
levis he drew out a sheet of paper and
handed it to rawley the waddy read
what had been written in pencil

dear boss

  by the time you get this i will be so far
away you will never find me im taking the
payroll money you sent me to town to get and
leaving this part of the country for good
sorry it has to be this way but a feller has
to think of himself to get ahead adios

buck rawley

  i didnt write this rawley said it
dont even look like my handwriting
boss

 i know martin nodded i checked
that note with some samples of yore
handwriting i had around buck the
rancher sank into a chair and motioned
rawley into another nearby now tell
me what happened

  rawley related just what had occurred
after he had met dart fenton on the
trail martin listened silently until raw-
ley reached the point of telling how
fentons horse had gone over the cliff
just before rawley had been knocked
senseless

 but why wasnt the black killed
martin asked thats fentons hoss
yuhre ridin aint it buck

  it is said rawley the black went
over the cliff but some brush broke his
fall he was all right when i found him
down below this mornin the waddy
frowned now that yuh know that dart
fenton stole the payroll money all yuh
got to do is make a complaint to the
sheriff

  afraid it isnt that simple said mar-
tin in the first place sheriff lang
wont believe that dart fenton would
steal any ranch payroll money

puzzled the young cowboy
pushed back his stetson to scratch
his head

 why not asked rawley remem-
beri only been ridin for the bar m for
a couple of months so i dont know all
the folks in this part of the country

his own good	

whos dart fenton anyway

  hes supposed to be one of the richest
men in mesquite valley said martin
hes head of the acme minin company
over at the south end of the valley from
all i hear the mine is turning out a lot
of gold the ranch owner smiled
grimly so why would fenton want to
steal a ranch payroll there wasnt but
five hundred dollars in the payroll
four hundred and seventy-six dollars
and fifty-three cents said rawley
thats the amount yuh had on the check
i got cashed boss he got to his feet
i aim to prove fenton stole the money
also ill get it back and make him tell
why he did it

  all right with me if you can do it
said martin but yuh shore picked yore-
self a job buck he looked intently at
the young waddy even though youre
a new man in the outfit i believe yore
story and im trustin you to do like yuh
say

  thanks boss rawley flushed with
gratitude at martins words ill do it
he was still holding the note that had
been pinned on his saddle now he
folded it up and thrust it into a pocket of
his levis soons i rest up im saddlin
a fresh hoss and ridin over to the acme
mining company to have a little talk
with dart fenton

  that should be right interestin
said bill martin as he got up and went
into the ranchhouse

  rawleys head still ached from the
blow fenton had hit him with the gun-
barrel he rode the black to the cavvy
corral unsaddled the horse turned it
into the enclosure with the rest of the
horses there and headed for the bar m
bunkhouse

  old jeff lee the ranch cook was
sitting on a bench in front of the bunk-
house peeling potatoes the men of the
outfit had eaten their breakfast and
ridden out on the range to do their work

  a bad penny always turns up said
the cook as he saw rawley where have
you been buck

  gettin over a headache i got from a
gun-barrel said rawley seating him-
self on the bench beside the cook feller
named dart fenton knocked me over the
head and stole the ranch payroll last
night

  that isnt the way i heard it said
lep according to the note you wrote
you should be in mexico or some place
exciting western



by this time

  i didnt write that note said raw-
ley fenton must have done it he
shore took a chance on nobody around
here knowin my handwritin reckon
he figgered he hit me so hard he killed
me

  fenton eh said the cook thought-
fully old jeff lee was an odd character
he had been a cook all his life and a good
one it was the sort of work he liked
best claiming that it gave him more time
for reading and he read good books
strange man fenton always going
around voicing platitudes theres a
man who is too smart for his own good
boss says nobody will believe fenton
stole the payroll said rawley

  they wont said lee not with
fenton supposed to be so rich from his
gold mine the old cook grinned
guess it takes a thief to catch a thief
rawley stared at the cook for a mo-
ment and then nodded as an idea struck
him

  yuhre right jeff he said as he got
to his feet it takes just that

  a half hour later buck rawley left the
bar m riding a roan horse from his
string and with his saddle roll tied to the
cantle

  he rode south across the valley and
had traveled five or six miles before he
finally saw the buildings and shaft of
a gold mining operation ahead of him

  it was the square one-story wooden
building with the sign acme mining
company office on it that focused raw-
leys attention as he rode closer dart
fenton came to the door and stood there
watching him the big man wore no hat
and rawley saw that fenton was par-
tially bald

  howdy rawley said as he halted
the roan near the door of the office you
shore worked it slick as a whistle fen-
ton the boss figgers i made up the
story about you stealin the payroll
money so he fired me

  i told you i was unlucky for other
people said fenton sadly but i made
one mistake rawley i thought i hit
you hard enough to kill you i should
have made sure of that

  rawley frowned this wasnt what he
had expected he had believed that fen-
ton would deny the whole thing claim-
ing that he had never seen rawley before
in his life yet here was fenton calmly
admitting everything rawley couldnt

decide whether or not that was a smart
move on fentons part

as he sat in the saddle looking
around it dawned on rawley that
there were no signs of activity at the
acme mine no men were working in
fact there didnt seem to be anybody
around the place but fenton that just
wasnt customary for a mine that was
supposed to be turning out a lot of gold

  rawley remembered that he had heard
stories of other ranch payroll robberies
during the past month and once the west
bound overland stage had been held up
and the money box stolen it had been
a lone masked man who had committed
those robberies he had not been caught

  i just came to tell yuh that i aim to
make yuh pay for what yuh done to me
fenton said rawley quietly youll
find that im right unlucky to some
folks too

  then i better do something about it
fast fenton said

  his hand flashed down to the gun in
his holster he had the weapon half
raised when rawley shot the colt out
of his hand the bullet from rawleys
gun had struck metal so the big mans
hand was not hurt

  fenton looked at his empty hand the
gun lying on the ground and then at the
big dark-haired waddy still sitting
calmly in the saddle there was an ex-
pression of fright on the mine owners
face

  yuhre fast with a gun he muttered
faster than i am

 right rawley nodded and i
usually hit where i aim he smiled
grimly yuh know im beginnin to
feel sorry for you fenton yes sir id
shore hate to be in a tight like you are
meanin what asked fenton anx-
iously

  that you are goin to suffer a lot
said rawley still covering the mine
owner with his gun first im goin to
steal every bit of money and gold yuhve
got from yuh then im goin to cripple
you with bullets shoot a man in the
right place in the leg and he dont ever
walk good after that same thing if yuh
hit him in the arm just right-makes that
arm kind of useless afterward

  bluff nothing but bluff said fen-
ton but he didnt sound at all certain
when is all this going to happen
thats what yuhll find the hard part
too smart for

of it said rawley you wont ever
know just when i will start

  he glanced beyond fenton sunlight
streamed in through the windows of the
office through the open doorway raw-
ley could see a big iron safe it was
closed and there was a combination dial
on it that safe interested buck rawley
quite a bit

  fentons gun had dropped close to the
right side of rawleys horse with his
gun in his left hand the waddy leaned
down from the saddle to pick up the
colt fenton thought he saw his chance
and he lunged at rawley from the door-
way rawley saw him coming as he
swung back up in the saddle he hit
fenton with the barrel of the mine
owners gun and knocked him flat

 i owed yuh that rawley said
thrusting fentons gun into his belt and
sticking his own colt back into the hol-
ster be seein yuh but fenton didnt
answer he was still stunned by the
blow

  rawley picked up his reins and rode
away fast getting out of range before
fenton could scramble to his feet rush
into the office and find another weapon

  now theres a feller who dont really
know what is goin to happen next
muttered rawley as he went ripping
deep into the brush some distance away
from the mine acted like he believed
what i told him about cripplin him for
life too which was more than i did
rawley had eaten breakfast before he
left the bar m jeff lee had even fixed
a bundle of food that the waddy now
carried in his saddle roll he waited
until noon hidden back in the brush and
then ate again and washed the meal
down with water from a stream

  that afternoon rawley rode to red
gulch in the town he found the sheriff
and talked to the lawman for some time
sheriff matt lang finally nodded

  might work at that lang said we
shore got to have proof before i can do
anythin

  a little later rawley rode out of
town he headed south across the valley
toward the acme mine it was dark
when he reached the mine leaving his
horse hidden back in a clump of trees he
approached the mining office building on
foot the office was dark and there was
no sign of fenton anywhere around
rawley decided that the mine owner had
probably gone to town

his own good	

the door of the office was locked on
the outside with a flimsy looking
padlock rawley broke the lock with a
heavy blow of his gun butt opened the
door and entered the office then he
struck a match found an oil lamp on a
desk and lighted it

  he went to the big safe tried the
handle and found it was locked he
scowled and looked around the office he
had to get that safe open and see what
was inside a box of dynamite was on
the floor in one corner some distance
away was another box that contained dy-
namite fuse caps

  shore careless the way they keep ex-
plosives around here said rawley
but also right handy for me

  he got three sticks of dynamite and
a fuse cap he found some long fuse
cord he ran this around the safe near
the top then he fastened the dynamite
sticks right beside the upper hinge of
the safe he attached the fuse cap to one
of the sticks

  it may just blow the hinge off raw-
ley muttered as he worked or it may
blow up the whole office cant be cer-
tain what dynamite will do

  he was so intent on what he was doing
that he did not see the big man who
stepped silently through the open door-
way rawley struck a match and lighted
the short fuse on the dynamite cap

  got yuh snapped fenton as he
grabbed the gun out of rawleys holster
from behind the waddy you werent so
smart this time

 rawley swung around as fenton
moved to one side the waddy grabbed
the big mans gun arm with both hands
gave a heave and fenton went flying
over the waddys shoulder to land on the
floor of the office the gun in fentons
hand roared as the big man was tossed
around by rawley the bullet flying
harmlessly out through the door the
fall knocked the weapon from fentons
hand

  rawley snatched up the gun then
glanced at the fuse it was burning fast
he holstered the gun grabbed fenton
by the shoulders and dragged him out of
the office

  a moment later there was a deafening
explosion as the dynamite went off the
building shook and smoke rolled out of
the doorway when the smoke had
drifted away rawley peered inside the

bandy legs

by richard brister

   when it was a case of fight run or perish little john
   mcdougall proved even an easterner could win through

the sandy-haired bandy-legged
little man perched precariously
atop the rickety ladder as he nailed
the neatly lettered sign to the new build-
ing

general merchandise
dry goods-sundries
j mcdougall prop-portal nebraska

descending the ladder he stepped
back to survey his handiwork with a
gleam of sharp pride in his mild blue

eyes for here in the fine big new store
was the crystallization of the hopes and
dreams he had so long carried close to
his heart

  hows she look charley he asked
the lanky red-bearded giant beside him

  good said the giant grinning and
rubbing a calloused hand across a tobac-
co-stained cheek jim-dandy id say

  john mcdougall smiled softly sure
you dont want that job clerking for me
cant pay a whole lot to start but the


bandy

workd be steady

  im a carpenter john replied the
red-bearded man thrusting his barrel
chest forward id never stick it work-
in indoors but im thankful to yuh
for the suggestion he grinned around
his cud of tobacco open for trade now
are yuh id admire to shove the first
dollar acrost yore counter john i could
use me some chawin tobacco

  come along john said he grinned
happily and would have led the big fel-
low inside had not a rasping voice hailed
him

  hold up a minute mcdougall

  john swung his small body toward the
sound in a precise little pivot it was
clute johnson johnson was a tall bony
gent with drooping gorilla-like arms and
a wedge-shaped face half of which was
disfigured by a hairy brown birthmark
he came up the plank walk now limping
a little

johnson had the only other dry
goods store in this mushrooming
boom town on nebraskas platte river
but rumor had it that the big man hadnt
always earned his living by peaceful
trading it was said here in portal that
johnsons crooked leg was a memento of
a brush with the law down in kansas
and that he had packed his outlaw guns
in mothballs when the shattered leg
healed then had used the stake he had
saved up following crooked trails to go
into a healthier line of endeavor

  john wasnt one to set much stock in
rumors he neither liked nor disliked
clute johnson from his short acquaint-
ance with the man so far he kept his
voice neutral

  whats on your mind johnson

  the man fingered the birthmark that
stained his thin cheek and stared con-
templatively at the new store

  pretty he said softly by heck
shes right pretty mcdougall makes my
place look tired there was a hard edge
on his voice as he finished

  johns blue eyes came up sharply six
weeks ago when he had stepped off the
river boat at the portal landing he had
at once sensed the power for growth in
this town he had talked with james
hartwell the local banker and one of the
towns founding fathers and had driven
a rig into the country beyond the town
and gazed at lush farms at fine cattle
grazing he had compared this years

legs	

population count with that of the year
preceding and had then agreed with
james hartwell that this town was ear-
marked for greatness that it would some
day be a flourishing city

  guess ive found what ive been look-
ing for hartwell hed told the banker
this towns going to grow like a mush-
room im going to put down some roots
and try to grow with it

  fine beamed the banker at heart a
boomer what kind of roots mcdou-
gall farming or business

  ive been looking over clute john-
sons general store john admitted
seems to me hes asking a mighty stiff
price for-

  hold up now warned the banker
he shifted uneasily behind his big desk
and held his eyes down yuhre not
thinkin of tryin to open another general
store in portal mcdougall

  any law against it john asked
simply

  aint any law in portal yet mcdou-
gall thats the main trouble yuh take
a man with clute johnsons background
-well i just wouldnt cross him now
im mighty eager to see this town grow
and id like to see yuh set down here
with us son but why set up a new gen-
eral store this town needs a hardware
and a good hotel-restaurant and a
barber

  and a good general store john said
pointedly with an up-to-date stock of
goods and fair prices based on a fair
profit margin

  i can see yuhre dead set on it son
sighed the banker and let his boft hands
plop down on the desk as yuh say
theres no law against it well i wish
yuh luck and son-if yuh run into
trouble with clute remember i warned
yuhi

  john had done better than that the
blood of the proverbially canny scot
flowed within john mcdougall and sim-
ple logic sent him from the bankers
office direct to clute johnson the surest
way to defeat an approaching crisis was
to prevent it entirely and he spoke
straight out to johnson

  im thinking of opening a store here
in town johnson its been said that
you might try to make trouble

  clute johnsons eyes came up slowly
general store

  thats my line

  there was a pregnant pause during
s	exciting western

which the thin mans black eyes care-
fully took his number go ahead he
said pleasantly enough

  john had been looking for hard words
between them at the very least a minor
scene the placidity of the bony mer-
chant surprised him and pleased him

  hope well get along all right john-
son no reason we shouldnt course
well be in direct competition once ive
opened my place but that wont matter
much the way this towns expanding
my names mcdougall

  he was surprised at the warmth of
clute johnsons handclasp luck to
yuh mcdougall

  it was the second time he had been
wished luck in his venture within the
hour and he recalled the parting words
of hartwell the banker  if yuh have
trouble with clute remember i warned
yuh

he was remembering now as he
heard the hard edge in johnsons
voice and as the thin man with the dis-
figuring birthmark stared at his new
store and muttered makes my place
look tired

  thats because its new john said
half-apologizing in a year or two you
wont recognize it

  clute johnson looked at him shortly
all stocked up and ready to open hey
mcdougall

  john nodded there was something in
the mans manner which he didnt cotton
to he could not quite put his finger
on the thing or analyze it a certain
aggressiveness which reminded him of
those ugly rumors about clute johnsons
background

mind if i look johnson murmured
john cast a short glance toward the
red-bearded giant whose carpentering
wizardry had largely created the new
building before them

  mind dropping back a bit later char-
ley he asked and the big fellow
shrugged in agreement john led clute
johnson into the store and watched his
competitors face doubtfully as johnson
sized up the shelves and showcases full
of shiny new stock

  neat johnson said nodding and
with that same hard inflection in the tone
of his voice yuhve put a lotta thought
into this place mcdougall and expe-
rience id say this aint yore first store
thats plain to see

  i had a small place in philadelphia
john admitted came to this country
from aberdeen scotland nine years ago
johnson i had a small stake and built
up a middling fair trade in the city but
the competition was mighty stiff i
wasnt getting ahead fast enough to pay
for the effort thats why i sold out and
came west this countrys growing fast
i mean to grow with it

  small men said clute johnson smil-
ing down at him come sort of impa-
tient

  i left my wife and children back east
johnson till i can set up a decent home
for them out here sure im impatient
ive got good reasons three of them
yuh also got somethin else mc-
dougall

 john frowned upward at him
what

  bad news cornin

  bad news

  clute johnson smiled thinly without
humor i like this place yuh got here
mcdougall he fondled the brown stain
on his cheek let his eyes rove around the
big room well-built solid neat
clean and everything in its proper place
orderly thats what i like it mcdou-
gall shows imagination

  johns blue eyes on johnsons lean
face never flickered

  that place of mine now-it aint
much the thin man went on original-
ly built for a house rickety too small
for my stock and the roofs begun leak-
in like a sieve already im gettin
mighty sick of it i tell yuh but this
place- his black eyes rolled in admir-
ation -this heres more like it

  what was the man getting at john
wondered fretfully well im glad
you like it he said quietly

  i do better than like it mcdougall
i want it im goin to buy it

  johns eyes bored at the bony disfig-
ured face trying to read through the
mask johnson presented if thats a
josh johnson he snapped out shortly
its not very funny

  aint joshin mcdougall the tall
man said smiling blandly i want this
place and i sure mean to have it been
watchin close this past six weeks while
yuh was puttin her up yuh sure built
her pretty im a direct kind of man
mcdougall i come down here with bus-
iness in mind and heres to prove it
he pulled a long rectangular slip of
bandy

paper from the pocket of his black town
coat  and handed it over

  it was a check on james hartwells
bank john saw instantly the arrogant
devil had actually had the presumption
to make out a check drawn to his order
assuming because he wanted the place
that the deal was as good as completed

john felt a pulse of blood pound
hard at his temple when he read the
amount of the offer four thousand
dollars he whispered four thousand
why man you must be plain crazy of
all the high-handed nonsense i ever
heard of this takes the prize

  thats my offer mcdougall john-
sons voice had turned brittle i figure
yuhre goin to take it

  now wait a minute spluttered john
his tiny fists clenching you talk like
an idiot hear me in the first place im
not selling i never broke my back build-
ing and stocking this place for you to
take over in the second place my stock
alone set me back more than four thou-
sand his voice choked off as a thought
occurred to him what kind of a game
are you playing johnson was this
why you encouraged me to go ahead
yuhll find clute johnson said
meaningly that we dont go in much
for games out this-away mcdougall
mebbe yuh aint caught on yet to the fact
this heres a frontier country aint no
law out here yet except what a man
chooses to lay down for his ownself me
now i used to tote the law around with
me in a pair of tied-down gun holsters
but here lately ive give up the habit

  im willin to talk things out with a
man peaceful and friendly so long as
he dont rear back on his high heels and
get ornery with me johnson continued
that theres my personal check for four
thousand dollars mcdougall yuh can
go down to jim hartwells bank any
time yuhre so minded and collect yore
money i understand yuhve took out a
registered deed on this place i come
here to get it

  a wild gurgling laugh escaped past
johns clenched teeth he took the
mans check in his two small hands and
methodically ripped it to shreds

  clute johnsons disfigured face twist-
ed with sudden anger he was breath-
ing heavily as he stared down at john

  i was kinda hopin yuhd do that mc-
dougall he said softly

legs	

  youre standing on my property
johnson john said shortly theres a
sawed-off double-barreled shotgun over
there in back of my counter get out

  johnson showed yellow-stained teeth
against the brown of his birthmark
yuhre goin to wish yuhd never tore
up that check mcdougall he warned

  get out john snapped coldly

  peppery fer a little man aint yuh
johnson suddenly stepped forward
limping and reached a talonlike arm out
toward him john scampered back and
grabbed a heavy pitchfork from a rack
of farm implements beside the counter
jabbing it at the tall man

  move johnson he said the doors
wide open and waiting

  johnson muttered something under
his breath and glared at the little man

  move john snapped at him and
sent the sharp-pointed tines briskly for-
ward toward the taller mans darkened
face

  johnson retreated slowly toward the
door and backed through it john fol-
lowed grimly the brandished pitchfork
an ever-present threat to the other

  there was a clique of idlers out on the
plank walk and rather than make a
spectacle of himself before these fellow-
townsmen the merchant suddenly turned
his back on john and limped away
swiftly

  yuhve just bought yoreself a whole
heap of trouble mcdougall was the
last thing john heard him say

  a week later in the office of hartwell
the banker clute johnson spoke harsh-
ly i want that place hartwell and i
mean to have it yuh goin to string
along on this thing or am i goin to have
to parade yore past in front of yuh

  the banker tugged at his plump cheek
with one harried white hand clute
yuhre goin crazy crazy for power

  never mind the sermon johnson
said i want that place that crazy
little philadelphia pilgrims only been
open a week and hes took pretty near
all my trade from me already i wont
have it hart i-

  sh-h-h breathed the banker with a
quick glance at the door of his office
dont call me that here clute if any-
one was to connect the name with the
old days back in kansas why id be fin-
ished

  clute johnson laughed shortly nerv-
ous type aint yuh if yuh ask me yuh
	exciting western

was a better man when yore name was
jack hart and we was robbin stages
together

  not so loud clute groaned the
banker swiping his forehead with the
back of one soft hand forget about
that stuff altogether will yuh

 sure johnson agreed grinning
coldly when yuh say yuhll throw in
and help me get rid of that doggone
little pilgrim the nerve of that little
coyote usin a pitchfork on clute john-
son if i was totin a gun id of drilled
him

  clute yuhre too rash too blood-
thirsty always were weve got a good
thing here now and yuhve got to con-
trol that hot temper of yores

  youve got a good thing yuh mean
johnson corrected bitterly honest
jim hartwell the go-gettin young
banker wouldnt them dumbhead farm-
ers raise a holler if they knowed it was
really jack hart safekeepin their mon-
ey you stringin along hart or do i
have to start droppin a few hints about
yore past

  clute ive been straight for six years
now what-what do yuh mean to do to
mcdougall

  get rid of him what else

  clute i wont be a party to any more
killin

  dont talk like a fool who men-
tioned killin were respectable busi-
ness men now our thievins turned
lawful yuhre speculatin in boom
town land with yore depositors money
and i been price-gougin a fortune out
of em on dry goods until that bandy-
legged little scotchman popped up to
ruin my game we got to work it slick
and careful because we got to keep the
good will of this town or were through
hart theres no way to force the suck-
ers to buy my stuff or put their dough in
yore bank i aint fool enough to risk
what ive got here by killin mcdougall
hes made hisself too many friends  
but if he refuses to leave and yuhre
not goin to kill him-

  he refuses so far johnson cut in
what he needs is persuadin and i
got the boys that can do it

  logan and burks though the day
was hot the stout banker shivered

  them twoll make him say time 
johnson said laughing harshly and
theyll enjoy the job while theyre at it
main trouble is gettin him out of town

without causin a ruckus i dont want
nobody to know what the game is get
him out of town quietly and let the boys
work him over thats all i want then
when he comes tail-draggin in hell be
only too glad to sell his place out to me
and line out for philly

  but if he talks before he leaves he
could ruin us

  hell be too scared to talk by the
time them two get through with him
clute its no good hartwell said
when the town sees the marks on him
and realizes yuhve had those two hard-
cases workin on him theyll be after
yore scalp

  wont be no marks theres ways to
hurt a man without leavin telltale marks
on him logan and burks know their
trade good enough to manage that part
i reckon so far as the townll know
the pilgrim just got cold feet and sloped
out kind of sudden nobodyll suspect
our part in it

the bankers plump hands twitched
i havent come in on this thing yet
clute doggone it all im not goin to
either ive been straight for six years
now and i like the feel of it no more
runnin from the law for me

  how much of my money is in that tin
can safe of yores outside there hart
johnson asked slyly seeming to ignore
hartwells refusal to go along with him

  about forty thousand the banker
said uncomfortably why

  get it

 but-

  get it hart johnson ordered calm-
ly im withdrawin thats all

  clute itll take all our cash-on-hand
to make up that kind of a kitty yuh
want to start a run on the bank and
throw me out of business

  this here is saturday hart said
johnson wont be no run on yuh till
monday mornin likely get my money
im stashin it in my office safe over the
week end you string with me and do
what i want and ill deposit that money
again before yuh open on monday
otherwise-well these lunkhead farm-
ers aint like to take it kindly you specu-
latin in land with their hard-earned
dollars yuhd look right pretty on the
end of a lynch rope hart

  the banker winced clute yuh-yuh
wouldnt

  im askin yuh for my money john-
bandy

son said coldly

  what do yuh want me to do clute
groaned the banker

  now thats the way i like to hear the
canary bird sing johnson said rubbing
his hands the thing about this pil-
grim now-hell trust you hart a
couple smart lads like us oughta be able
to work that up for somethin dont yuh
think the thin man grinned his yel-
low teeth showing like an uneven row of
corn kernels   

  hartwells voice was oily persuasive
prettiest spot in the world mcdougall
yuh could look for days and never hope
to locate yoreself a prettier home site
on the edge of the lake you say
hartwell john mcdougall asked
how much lake frontage to it

  three hundred feet and crawlin
with timber the cabins a mite run
down but with the lumber so handy
fixin her up wouldnt cost much to
speak of the minute those settlers de-
faulted on their mortgage and the bank
took the property over i thought of yuh
mcdougall yuhre goin to be an im-
portant man in this town some day and
of course i knew yuh were eager to lo-
cate so yuh could send for yore family
why that was mighty thoughtful of
you hartwell the little scotchman
was pleased the friendship of a suc-
cessful banking man was a precious com-
modity to a man starting in business
sure would like to see it but im afraid
to walk out of here for even an hour or
so and leave my place unprotected clute
johnson swore hed make trouble for me
and-

  clute the banker laughed dont
worry about him his barks a lot
worsen his bite mcdougall

  maybe but i still hate to leave the
place alone

  yuhre tossin up a wonderful chance
to buy a nice property dirt cheap
prodded hartwell look suppose yuh
slide out of town on the quiet ill meet
yuh with my rig up at north fork and
whos to know yuh aint still here pro-
tectin the store

  its a thought mused john softly
hartwell was kind in making this offer
and he knew it would not be a wise pol-
icy to turn down the favor besides the
place sounded ideal from the standpoint
of margaret and the youngsters may-
be this way he could send for them
sooner than hed anticipated

legs	

  its sunday said hartwell clutes
not likely to make trouble for yuh on the
lords day mcdougall

  this final argument was unnecessary
ill go along for a look-see hartwell
john said be glad to

  it was on the edge of no bottom lake
and jouncing up the dirt lane toward the
cabin john had to admit he never had
seen a prettier home site it was heavily
wooded the dirt underfoot was a gold-
en brown sloping down gently toward
the clear shimmering lake where a rick-
ety rowboat jostled spasmodically
against a rotting landing

  whose boat john wondered aloud
previous owners reckon thatd go
with the deal mcdougall shall we
look at the cabin

 hartwell keyed the door open and
stepped aside courteously to let john
enter before him it was dank and dark
inside and as the little man moved cau-
tiously across the worn floorboards try-
ing to adjust his eyes he felt a hard
object nudge his chest he thought he
had walked against the corner edge of a
high shelf for an instant

  then he heard the harsh breathing of
someone there in the dark and stood
stock still his heart pounding in a
sharp crescendo he lifted an explora-
tory hand toward the object which was
nudging his chest

  john froze where he stood behind
him the bantering voice of clute john-
son said softly light up that coal oil
lamp burks and let the pilgrim see
what hes walked into

somewhere in the dark room a
lucifer match scraped noisily flame
guttered up from the wick of a smoky
lamp on a rickety table john stared
down numbly at the long glinting barrel
of the colts six-shooter which was
pressed against his stricken chest the
hard-eyed bristle-chinned man grinning
wickedly behind the gun was a stranger
to him as was his wolf-faced sidekick
the man clute johnson had addressed
as burks

  john swallowed thickly whats this
all about clute

  cornin from a man with a gun stuck
into his ribs said johnson that aint
such a smart question pilgrim set him
down and hold that gun on him logan
come on outside hart i want to talk
to yuh
	exciting western

  john heard clumping footfalls as
clute johnson went outside with the
banker johnson had called hartwell
hart and on the surface of things
that seemed rather strange hartwell
seemed a dignified ort yet johnson
acted mighty familiar with him

  and then it came to him hartwell
and johnson had worked this thing to-
gether the banker had been the judas
sheep leading john to the slaughter

  and a slaughter it would be he knew
with a sharp thrust of panic to judge by
the tone of johnsons voice and by the
woolfish sneers of these two hardcase
hombres who were riding herd on him

  john did a foolish emotional thing
then he snapped out at the gun logan
was pointing at him knocked it aside
and attempted to knee the taller man in
the stomach to that end he succeeded
but logan raging wrapped bearlike
arms around him and pinned him se-
curely

  crazy little fool the gunman
snorted doggone it burks do some-
thin hes worsen an armful of squir-
rels nail him

  john heard the other men crossing the
room in three lumbering strides some-
thing heavy and hard smashed down on
his head pinwheels of light danced
weirdly before his blinded eyes then he
sagged down limply in logans big arms
his chin sagging   

  the devil johnson swore i might
of known yuhd make a mess of things
i told yuh to get him out here without
lettin anyone see you two together

  i couldnt help it said the banker
it was just that one farmer that saw us
bill jannsen whatd yuh expect me to
do-drive off the road and show mc-
dougall what the game was hes no
fool clute

  hes no nothin snapped johnson
shortly not when the boys get
through with him

  clute yuhre not goin to kill him
yuh said-

  what i said when i needed yuh
hart and what i say now aint the same
things exactly sure im goin to kill
him

  no clute not that the banker
was sweating i beg of you dont do
it

  clute johnson stared disgustedly at
him yuh used to have some sand
hart but yuhve gone soft as butter

runnin that bank never did trust a soft
man noways

  hartwell gulped his eyes popped
with sudden fright clute i wouldnt
talk i dont like it but if thats what
yuhre set on doin i sure wouldnt
squeal on yuh

  lets see mused johnson softly
you was seen leavin town with the pil-
grim suppose yuh never come back
now and they was to go over yore books
at the bank tomorrow and find yuh was
short forty thousand why doggone
me hart if they wouldnt figure yuhd
took and absconded

  clute in the name of heaven man
what are yuh thinkin of

  then smiled johnson softly when
the pilgrim failed to show up theyd fig-
ure-well he was with you last time
anyone seen either of yuh mebbe hed
caught on what yuh was up to and the
pair of youd fought and youd killed
him or mebbe youd both sloped out
of these parts and shared that bank
money johnson chuckled and id
buy that place of his for a song when it
went up for auction

  its no good screamed the chalk-
faced banker itd never stick th-
thered be the bodies

  that theres an all-fired deep lake
hart i hear tell a dead man wont float
worth a shuck if yuh take and tie a good-
sized rock onto him and them fish
could stand a change in their diet
johnson wore a bantering smile as he
slowly pulled a snub-nosed  revolver
from a shoulder holster the unarmed
banker cringed away from him his pale
eyes stricken clute clute you   

the gun in johnsons hand leaped
like a striking snake the harsh
sound of its explosion thundered and
volleyed among the jackpines and across
the shimmering surface of the lake
which rumor said had no bottom jack
hart alias james hartwell struck the
soft ground like a limp sack of potatoes

  johnson holstered the gun and limped
back into the cabin his eyes narrowed
and he fingered the birthmark on his
cheek when he saw the limp figure of
john mcdougall on the floor what
happened

  the little son tried to jump my gun
boss burks had to gun-whip him
johnson stroked his bony chin for a
moment unwrap that baling wire from
bandy

around them stovepipes choose up a
couple of hefty stones down at the lake-
side haul that fool of a hartwell
whats left of him into the boat along
with the pilgrim when yuh get out to
deep water tie them rocks on em and
dump em    what yuh scroochin yore
ugly face up thataway for burks goin
chicken-heart are yuh

  i cant swim boss that old boats
so rotten it-it dont look healthy

  cut out yore blasted caterwaulin and
get goin johnson snapped im goin
to snake back into town and try to make
it look like i never rode out here you
two drift into my place around wednes-
day and ill pay yuh off with mebbe a
nice-sized bonus providin everythin
goes right

 he turned on one heel and limped
out of the cabin then swore at the sight
of hartwells rig and matched team of
driving horses

  roll that rig of hartwells down un-
der the water he called back brusquely
destroy that monogrammed harness i
reckon you twoll know how to get rid
of them big bays and yuh can split the
profits

 johnson mounted his long-legged
chestnut roan and spurred away swift-
ly  

 john opened one cautious eye and
stared upward through the half-light of
gathering dusk at the sweating face of
the man named burks a savage pulse
of pain drove at his temple he closed
the cautious eye and tried to gather his
mixed thoughts together he was well
back in the stern of that rotten old row-
boat he had seen out in front of the
cabin he could hear the creak of
burks oars in the oarlocks and the dull
swish of the lake water driving past him
against the boats tender hull

  he felt something cold and clammy
against one inert wrist and reopened-the
eye to investigate it was he saw with a
feeling of nausea the dead body of hart-
well sprawling limply against him

  forward of burks in the prow logan
was sitting move them oars faster
he growled its cornin on dark al-
ready we got our work cut out to tie
them rocks on em and dump em afore
nightfall

  john gritted his teeth fighting the
sick dread which passed through him
like a trapped rat he thought angri-
ly im like a trapped rat and theyre

legs	

going to drown me

  he struggled against the burning ache
in his head and tried to think clearly
back in scotland as a boy and again on
the schuylkill in philadelphia he had
gained a smattering familiarity with
small boats he knew this boats hull
was rotten that it would take little to
pierce it but a kick or a jab or any
overt action from him would undoubt-
edly earn him a murderers bullet he
moved cautiously letting his hand drift
in exploring small arcs across the boats
ribbed bottom

  there was he knew a wooden plug in
most of these boats so that they could
be drained out on dry land without the
need of turning them over if he could
find that plug there by jasper he
had it cautiously he worked the cork-
like plug from side to side till it
loosened then he pulled it out and
moved his leg over the incoming foun-
tain of lake water effectively throttling
the sound of its splashing

  thirty seconds of this and the man
burks suddenly lifted wet feet what
the devil he barked nervously this
old boats leakin whatd i tell yuh
slim find that leak i cant swim
worth a minute

  that so breathed john softly and
lifting one leg he sent his heel crashing
into burks frightened face the man
let go of the oars with a panicky snarl
and toppled headlong over the gunwale

john was on his feet like a cat rip-
ping one of those long oars free of
the oarlock he saw logan lifting a
long-barreled gun aiming carefully at
him john threw weight against the
right side of the boat the gun went
off at precisely that moment the slug
whistled its song of death past his ear
he swung his oar like a bat and clipped
logan on the side of the head with it

  the man groaned and flopped into the
water sinking down out of sight john
watched the place marked by fast-rising
bubbles for a full minute logan did
not reappear on the surface nor did
his non-swimming partner

  frightened fool probably smothered
himself the first trip under john
thought panting briefly he debated
the advisability of leaping in and trying
to save one or the other of the killers
but by the time he had re-plugged the
hole in the fast-settling boat and fished
	exciting western

one vagrant oar from the water he
knew it was too late to save either of
them

  he picked logans wet six-shooter out
of the water at the bottom of the boat
and stuck it into his shirt then he bent
his small back to the oars and swung the
half-submerged boat toward the
cabin 

  john mcdougall pulled james hart-
wells spanking big bays up sharp in
front of a crude log house on the out-
skirts of portal a lanky red-bearded
giant appeared in the doorway and
squinted hard at him

 mcdougall john mcdougall what
in cains happened to yuh yuh look
like a drowned rat man whered yuh
leave banker hartwell thats his rig
aint it

  hartwells dead charley john said
bitterly

  is he now and how did it happen
laddie

  swiftly while the carpenter gaped in
astonishment john sketched in the
whole story im heading for clute
johnsons place he concluded grimly
and see an end to this thing right now
john dont be goin off half-cocked
now clutell be too much for yuh hell
eat yuh fer breakfast sure as the devil
made such men as him

  its like he said john shrugged bit-
terly theres no law in this land yet
except what a man lays down for him-
self if its a case of fight or be driven
into the ground my vote goes for fight-
ing i wanted somebody to have the
facts charley in case-well in case hes
as good as you say

  john yuh cant do this its plain
crazy hell kill yuh

 my whole life is in that store
charley john said clutes meant to
have it from the beginning he would
have killed me im going to have it
out with him he clucked to the bays

  charley leaped to the seat beside him
man yuhre fair burnin to kill some-
thin aint yuh reckon ill just string
along and see fair play done yuhve 
gun i take it

  john murmured his gratitude for the
big fellows support and showed the gun
he had fished out of the rowboat he had
dried it out on his shirt and checked the
cartridges which logan had conven-
iently as it turned out greased against
moisture

  ever used a gun prodded doubtful
charley

  took part in some may day shoots
back home in scotland john mur-
mured im not the plucked pigeon i
look whoa down horses theres
clutes already hes got a light burn-
ing he pulled in on the bays and the
rig creaked to a halt across the shadowy
street from clutes store

  john felt a moment of indecision now
that the climactic moment had finally
come perhaps he was a fool pitting his
fledgling talent for gun-fighting against
a man who had once been an outlaw as
a family man he knew he ought to con-
sider margaret and the children but
there were times when a man had to
fight to carry the battle to an opponent
or evidently perish and if that wasnt
sufficient spur to his courage he could
always remember how johnson had in-
tended to dispose of him he felt a brit-
tle rage come to life in him

  he cupped his small hands clute
clute johnson he yelled hoarsely

a shadow passed over a window
in johnsons place then the front
door swung inward and johnson stood
framed there peering out anxiously in
an attempt to distinguish johns face

  get clear charley john whispered
resting a hand on the butt of the gun in
his belt get clear i think he sees
me

  but johnsons eyes were not that
good not in such a poor light and at such
a distance he came down his front
steps squinting a little and then he
made out the shape of the rig

 logan and burks he suddenly
snarled why you crazy fools
thought i told yuh to run that rig un-
der water

  evenin clute john said softly

  whos that johnson stood like a
nowman motionless speak up whos
here

  mcdougall

  john had to admire the man in this
terrible moment the unbelievable was
here coming to life before clute john-
sons eyes but the mans instinct for
survival supported him well through the
crisis

  why he said thats pretty a real
pretty kettle of fish id say and then
his hand blurred in a frenzied stab at
the gun within his black town coat
bandy legs

  john was tugging logans heavy colt
from under his belt but he knew he
could never hope to match the speed of
johnsons kill-crazy reflexes with his
free hand john slapped the reins
against the horses rumps smartly the
rig leaped forward as the surprised bays
strained in the harness precisely as
clute johnson snapped his first shot out
john leaped to the ground on light ban-
dy legs and triggered a snap shot at the
taller man then stepped nimbly aside

  clute shot again and johns arm hung
limp beside him as he watched the other
stagger drunkenly toward him trying
to lift his gun john aimed very care-
fully at the mans chest and pulled the
trigger

  he saw the brilliant orange flash split
the air between him and clute johnson
saw the man buck as the slug smashed
him head on

  johnson clapped a wavering hand to
his chest and came limping forward
still trying to lift his gun

 blast yore hide mcdougall he
growled ill get yuh yet

  he took one more limping step then
fell headlong into the dusty street



  some days later a sandy-haired bandy-
legged little man with a bandaged left
arm sat down at a fine oak desk and hast-
ily scribbled the following letter

dear margaret

  well darling the time has come every-
things ready and waiting out here for you
and the children take the train to omaha
and the steamer will bring you up the platte
river

  i am afraid your husband is not such a good
correspondent theres been quite a lot hap-
pening here but everything seems to work to
our advantage our local banker unfortu-
nately passed on since my last letter and
darling will you believe it the townspeople
have asked me to step into his shoes and run
the bank they seem to hold your husband
in some high regard-for what earthly reason
ill never tell you

  so now youre the wife of a man of in-
fluence are you smiling

  by the way the store is doing a land-office
business our competitor has also passed on
poor fellow

  im afraid i must close my work calls me
but do come post-haste to your

                         always loving

john

  p s-this seemed a rather wild town when

an uppercut and then sent
him staggering back with
a solid right

  broad shoulders

by cuff walters

     lazy budge hale didnt cotton to steady work or fighting
     but when trouble came along he was right there to meet it

for nearly an hour big budge
hale sandy-haired thirty and
mild of manner had sat on the
counter of the general store in link-
ville while dad henderson the
plump proprietor laboriously painfully
checked over invoices for a load of
freight that had arrived yesterday

  henderson was frowning through his
spectacles and mumbling two and
twos four    and fives nine

  thats right dad budge hale
agreed during the pause

  as if youd know you ignoramus
the storekeeper snapped irritably you
was probably asleep most of them three
years you went to the linkville school
if youre goin to set there by the hour
with your two hundred pounds bendin
my dry goods counter at least keep
still

  grinning the sturdy-shouldered loafer
lapsed into silence for another ten min-
utes

  then lanky gray-haired tom clark
the towns only lawyer entered the store


broad shoulders	

to buy a quarters worth of cigars

  you know dad he said every time
i look at budge i think of that big
waterfall up in deep canyon the at-
torney nodded toward the mountains

  how come henderson demanded
blinking

  clark looked at budge hales ample
body i keep thinking of all that power
going to waste

  youre right the storekeeper said
do you spose we could shame him into
a little action by remindin him of the
truth-that hes worsen his father old
smoky hale was old smoky would
get out and prospect a little or pretend
to hed even herd sheep when he got
too hungry or thirsty but budge
here wont budge

  lets not be unduly harsh dad said
clark amused by budges discomfiture
we must concede that young mr hale
helps out occasionally at the local black-
smith shop who knows but what some
day this brawny lad with the stature of
a rearing grizzly-and the mild disposi-
tion of a newfoundland dog-might
grow tired of sunning himself on the
doorstep of linkville he might even
yet go out and rustle up a steady job
no such luck tom henderson re-
plied shaking his bald head two
things budge shies away from-steady
work and fightin

  goaded until the hint of a spark had
kindled in his serene blue eyes budge
answered that

  ill be workin tomorrow he said
be up in the mountains cuttin poles
for that new corral the stablekeeper
wants to build-if i can get credit for
some grub

  credit-for grub henderson swal-
lowed hard ive often wondered if
you wouldnt try openin a charge ac-
count here some day budge well as
much as id like to accommodate you-
and i know youd pay me some time-i
might not live forty more years to col-
lect

heavy boots came clumping
through the open door of the store
and there was burly jake wyatt a
dark slate-eyed man of formidable bulk
who ran sheep on his range to the north
of town

 howdy dad jake wyatt said
gruffly you too clark and even mr
hale-of the sheep-stealin hales

 hold on jake said tom clark
gently dont you think budge is en-
titled to a more civil greeting than that
maybe old smoky hale did lose a few
sheep when he was herding for you just
before he died but i cant believe-

  i say smoky hale stole ten head of
my sheep sold em so he could grub-
stake himself for a prospectin trip-or
a spree i accused him of that and i
still accuse him of it yeah and if he
hadnt died from swiggin too much
booze id have collected out of his
whisky-soaked hide it still aint too
late yet to collect it out of the hide of
any friend or relative- wyatts slate-
gray eyes tossed a contemptuous look at
husky budge hale -who might want
to take old smokys part

  you sound like you mightve stopped
at the saloon fore you come here jake
said dad henderson timidly

  not too long to be able to take care of
myself said the brawniest man on the
bell basin range its enough to make
a man hunt whisky that half-asleep
sheepherder of mine gus parker lettin
an old roan plug buck him off and bust
his arm

  old gus didnt hire out for a bronc
stomper said tom clark and if
youll remember jake i warned you
when you swapped for that old roan the
other day that he was a spoiled horse
and that you were foolish to trade your
bay horse for that roan and the forty
dollars you got to boot

  ill tend to my business wyatt re-
plied cantankerously is there any
sheepherders around that can take gus
place dad i cant herd my own sheep
ive got work to do at my ranch hay to
put up

  i dont know of anybody you can hire
right now henderson said

  there was a brief pause then for the
first time since jake wyatts entrance
budge hale spoke

 how much do you figure them ten
head of sheep was worth wyatt he
asked rather timidly the ones that
turned up missin when dad was herdin
for you

  jake wyatt stared at the man on the
counter about fifty dollars he an-
swered why

  well ive paid off what few little
debts dad left budge hale replied
perhaps you figured i could work out
that debt by herdin your sheep for a
	exciting

month

 dont be a jackass budge tom
clark said sharply youre not legally
bound to-

  shut up clark jake wyatt snapped
ive told young hale here to keep clear
of my mountain range told him that
if he didnt id give him a handlin hed
never forget and i wouldve too but
now since his heart seems to be in the
right place-since hes makin an offer to
pay for the sheep his dad sold-

  but he didnt sell them clark inter-
rupted budge the big lout is being
scared into this

  get out jake nodded toward the
door-and moved a menacing step to-
ward clark

  i will not answered the elderly at-
torney his eyes blazing you lay a hand
on me wyatt and youll regret your
rashness-i promise you that

  all right said wyatt wise enough
to realize that he might be standing on
the brink of costly trouble budge and
mell go out where we can talk alone
come on hale

  outside by the hitching rack budge
agreed to leave town on jake wyatts
wagon within the next ten minutes if
wyatt would drive past the old cabin
where budge lived down on the bank of
link creek budge would have his bed-
roll ready

  be there wyatt said youve made
a proposition hale and if you know
whats good for you youll live up to it
the sheepman headed for the saloon
in front of which his team was tied
budge hale turned and walked back into
the store he tried to ignore the hostile
gaze of tom clark and dad henderson
he laid a quarter on the counter and
asked for five sacks of smoking tobacco

  ill make it ten sacks said dad hen-
derson coldly since youre goin into
exile up on granite mesa for a month
big budge hale-bein scared into a
months slavery good gosh budge i
wonder how your broad back stays up-
right at all-with no spine to support
it

budge tried to grin and couldnt
not with the chill tone of dad
hendersons voice biting at him not
with old tom clark grim-lipped star-
ing at him as if he were something that
crawled

  imagine the big shaggy friendly

western

newfoundland turning sheep dog said
tom clark with glacial bitterness

  budge turned quickly and left the
store his ears were burning with whip-
like words that he would hear over and
over again in a lonely sheepwagon on
granite mesa an altitudinous range
where sounded the tinkling of bells
where old smoky hale had once played
shepherd smoky hale an improvident
prospector who had bequeathed to his
sturdy son a ramshackle cabin at the
edge of linkville a few samples of ore
piled in the corner of that cabin and
perhaps the virtue of honesty which
jake wyatt so emphatically doubted

  six long weeks of summer went by be-
fore budge hale returned to linkville
six long weeks before he walked shabby
and unshaven and grimed with dust into
the linkville store where dad hender-
son was selling tom clark some fish
hooks

  customer and proprietor turned and
stared at the newcomer

  look dad henderson said the
slave-by-choice has escaped his bondage
i thought you were going to work only
a month for wyatt budge and for
nothing

  it took him a couple extry weeks to
find a new herder-he said replied the
husky young man grinning

  the longest stretch you ever worked
in your life and you havent got enough
cash to buy a sack of tobacco dad
henderson gave a snort

  thats right budge agreed affably
has anybody-a stranger-been in
town lookin for me dad a stranger
who mustve lost his hair about the same
time you did

  nope said the storekeeper tossing
a sack of tobacco on the counter but if
there had been anybody lookin for you
id figgered he was some official from
the state insane asylum

  come to think of it there was a
stranger asking about mr hale last eve-
ning over at the hotel said tom clark
a rather heavy-set well-dressed man
who-there he comes now crossing the
street

  budge went outdoors he had gotten
only as far as the store hitching rack
when a rider came loping into town and
up to that rack it was jake wyatt who
swung down from a weary spur-
marked gray horse to impose his for-
midable bulk between budge and the ap-
broad shoulders	

proaching stranger

  what are you scowlin about jake
asked budge dont tell me that youve
just found some of your sheep missin
me and the new herder-the one you
finally brought out-counted em and
they was all there

  something else is missin from gran-
ite mesa though and from my sheep
wagon was the rumbled reply an old
pair of field glasses i warned you about
takin away anything that didnt belong
to you

  them glasses did belong to me
budge countered it was an old pair
my mother had give to my dad one
christmas a long time ago dad forgot
em left em in your wagon when he was
herdin for you

  when he was stealin from me the
same way youre tryin to steal wyatt
stormed youll fork them glasses over
to me or ill-

  dad didnt steal any sheep from you
budge interrupted

  no if you hadnt been satisfied he
did and if you hadnt been afraid id col-
lect that debt out of your yellow hide
some day you wouldntve come crawlin
to me like a shipped sheep dog and of-
fered to work the debt out

  glancing at dad henderson and tom
clark who had come out to the store
porch budge said

  accordin to old frenchy rebidaux
who still runs a few cattle the other side
of granite mesa you got awful tired of
eatin mutton one time wyatt and de-
cided to switch to veal for a little while
so one night when you was goin back
to your ranch from your sheep camp you
range butchered a crippled calf belong-
in to old frenchy and he caught you
at it to keep him from goin to the
law you offered him a good trade-ten
head of your best sheep for that crippled
calf and you throwed in a good saddle
horse to boot-the sorrel that frenchy
still rides thats how dad doin a little
prospectin along with his sheep herdin
come up with ten head of woolies miss-
in

  jake wyatt seemed a little stunned
and not unlike a huge rock-stiff statue
as he stood there blinking at budge
hales calm unhurried words words
fraught with the ring of truth

 yeah-prospectin jake wyatt
finally blurted and you done the same
thing up there on the mesa you half-

witted fool youve staked claims up
there you think youre goin to over-
run my range with a bunch of locoed
nugget chasers that aint got no more
sense than you or your whisky-soakin
old dad youll give me back them field
glasses you stole from my camp but
first ill cram that range-butcherin
story down your throat

jake wyatt was no longer a
statue slate eyes smouldering big
fists clenched in fury he bore down
upon budge hale and threw a haymaker
aimed at budges grinning face budge
ducked wyatts fist shot over the mark
and collided with the hitching rack post
a mistake that took toll of knuckle skin

 budge hale laughed jake wyatt
swore and rushed again but budge beat
him to the punch this time a solid left
hook cracked to wyatts face a swift-
following right landed still harder
wyatt was jolted up the bigger man
went insanely mad and for a moment
he swarmed all over budge but budge
weathered that attack and rocked wyatt
with an uppercut to the face another
blow to the body two more to the face
and a wrist-deep smash to the body

  yells of encouragement broke from
dad henderson and tom clark and
from a dozen other citizens who had
longed to see someone stand up to
mighty jake wyatt citizens who had
often expressed the desire to possess the
splendid physique of budge hale-
without of course his yellowness
but now the same men who had taunted
old smoky hales son and without real-
izing how deeply their verbal barbs had
pierced were now cheering for him

  perhaps it was the sting of long-suf-
fered barbs that spurred budge hale on
now giving him power to withstand the
punishment meted out to him and to
mete out punishment in return with
cool savagery blows hammering fiercely
to wyatts dripping face and straining
body

  desperate dangerous because of his
great power jake wyatt landed a blow
that nearly felled budge the crowd
groaned as they thought they were wit-
nessing a quick change in the tide of
battle but budge hale warded off the
next punch coming at him and tore into
the fray with a fury that beat a heavier
antagonist gasping and uncertain on his
feet into giving ground


exciting western

 from that moment on wyatt was
forced to retreat then he was no longer
on his uncertain feet he was weaving
from a left to the face and going down
from a vicious right that caught him on
the mouth and the main street of link-
viue became an uproar wyatt dropped
and lay motionless

 budge were all proud of you
whooped dad henderson jumping down
off the store porch and hurrying toward
the victor of a battle which onlookers
would never forget

  thats right agreed tall tom clark
but what i cant understand is if you
knew your dad hadnt stolen any sheep
from wyatt or if no sheep had even
turned up missing why in the dickens
did you go out to granite mesa and herd
wyatts woolies for six weeks cer-
tainly deep down in your heart you
werent afraid of wyatt youve just
proved that

  aint he though yelled an exultant
bystander

  maybe i was jjist curious tom
budge said flashing a warm if slightly
battered smile curious to know where
a certain piece of ore down at my old
cabin had come from i kind of had a
hunch it mightve come from granite
mesa and it turned out to be pretty
good ore-as i found out not too long

ago when i sent a sample of it to mr
mclory there a minin man that pros-
pected with my dad one summer years
ago mr mclorys got lots of money
now he told me if i could find a vein
of that kind of ore id be rich

  and he did find it-up on granite
mesa when he was herding sheep said
fred mclory chuckling i know i
was up there a couple days ago and my
companys paying budge hale enough
for his claims that-well he could buy
quite a chunk of this little town maybe
all of it

 bystanders gawked some gasped a
little tom clark smiled

  so thats why the big friendly dog
that suddenly turned grizzly wanted
jake wyatt to invite him out to range
that had been until recently forbidden
to him

  thats right said budge but mr
wyatts goin to be awful sore when he
finds out hes been herdin his sheep over
a gold mine all these years-without
knowin it come on tom i need a
good lawyer to draw up some papers for
mr mclory and me ill pay you well
for it

  he chuckled turned to dad hender-
son ill even pay you for that tobacco
you gave me dad and you wont have
to wait forty years to collect either

had a wdhd

foail

by chuck stanley

the morning after the trail-drive
moved out was a busy one for the
old-timer and his young friend they
were up long before daylight and attending
to their chores with a real will there was
still a lantern light burning in the kitchen
when they mounted their horses and set out
to pick up the drive at the first overnight
camp the ranch owner had no objection
to the arbuckles quest for knowledge but
insisted that they be back by night-fall

  as they rode along the old mossy-horn
said

  theres some things youre going to be
able to see for yourself son but i dont
reckon youre going to be able to learn much
about how they bed them critters down for
the night like we mentioned yesterday its
the job of the trail boss to figure out where
his herd is going to bed down when he
picks his spot he waits for the boys to come
along and they usually reach him about an
hour before sundown he gives his signal
and the point riders begin a job that is
known as throwing the herd some folks
call it throwing off the herd 

  gosh said the greenhorn what does
that mean

  i reckon it does sound like something
pretty drastic but it isnt it just means that
they move the herd about half a mile or so
off the trail so theyll have better grass to
bed down in and also to permit any follow-
ing herd to go on by if it has a hankering
to try it

riding down a herd

  the arbuckle then listened in fascina-
tion as he jogged along on his horse and the
old mavericker explained the technique of
riding down a trail herd this was the
job in which the point flank swing and drag

riders all concentrated their attention on the
job of bringing the point and the drag
of the herd together as they approached the
bed-ground bedding down a fairly large
herd was a job in itself and one that had to
be handled with skill and discretion the
animals could not be bunched in too small
an area or they would be restless through-
out the night

  on the other hand if they were scattered
all over the landscape it would be a hopeless
job to keep them under control

stampede trouble

  how do they work if the herd does hap-
pen to stampede the greener asked

  there are several ways of handling that
the old-timer declared for one thing the
origin of the word stampede itself ought to
be interesting to you it comes from the
spanish word estampida meaning a loud
noise or a great crash generally something
of this sort such as a clap of thunder a gun-

shot shouting indians or the sounds of
moving buffalo herds created the loud noise
or great crash that started a stampede such
noises seldom affected more than a small
group of cattle at the outset but the panic
of these few animals was soon transmitted
to their companions

  the mavericker then went on to explain
how the cowboys described the cattle in a

our pilgrim learns more trail - herding lingo


	exciting

stampede as rolling their tails most stam-
pedes occurred at night and then it was
necessary for the night herders to cut in
the cattle and attempt to swing them back
into a circle

  this was done by setting out flankers
who rode the rim of the herd firing their
six-guns or flapping their ponchos to divert
the attention of the cattle the fleeing herd
was finally shaped into a crude u and then
the two ends were forced in on each other
this operation was described as milling
the cattle were the animals who milled

origin of rodeo

  the horse and rider who were mixed up
in this nocturnal activity were said to be
rounding-in and later on rounding-up
from which two expressions came the
round-up and our more familiar spanish
equivalent the rodeo

  time passed rapidly as the old cowboy and
his young companion jogged along dawn
was coming up in the east behind them and
on the breezes that blew toward them from
the west they could already hear the lowing
sounds of the cattle the clatter of the cooks
tin pans and the sounds of voices finally
they came up over the edge of a swale and
saw the trail-herd below them

  what a sight remarked the youngster
impressed by the hundreds of cattle spread
out before him

  the animals were scattered over a broad
stretch of prairie and at the far limits of
the bed grounds there was the silvery breadth
of a winding river several cowboys were
riding along the near bank of the stream

  looks as though they watered along the
river last night the old-timer declared
thats a job that has to be done right too
son

  how do you figure that out inquired the
greenhorn

  well explained the mossy-horn
youve got to slow down your herd before
they hit the water so they wont stampede
on you then you fix it so that the head
of the herd begins drinking downstream
this way the critters who come along behind
wont have to drink the water that has been
muddied up by their fellows as other ani-
mals come to the rivers edge theyre hazed
upstream always finding clear water in front
of them

smart thinking

  thats pretty smart thinking admitted
the arbuckle as he made a note in his
book id never be able to figure out any-

western

thing like that

  by this time they were in camp and the
cookie pointed to the ever-ready coffee pot
while they were sipping a cup and resting
their horses the old-timer said

  that slowing down the herd is a good
idea any time like as not if the river aint
too wide some of them lead cattle would be
forced plumb across to the other side be-
fore the drag came up then youd have a
lively time trying to gather your herd no
animal likes to swim the same river twice-
much less three times which hed have to do
in a spot like that

  the cowboys on the trail drive greeted the
pair with good humor then turned to their
serious tasks the greener watched as the
men stowed their bedrolls carefully in the
chuck-wagon roped out their horses from
the remuda and set out on the job of mov-
ing the herd into formation the lads at-
tention was taken by the trail boss and one
of the waddies

the trail count

  they were mounted and sitting their
horses at a point on the trail leading down
to the river ford as the trail hands got
the cattle into motion they were pushed
through between the two men

  whats going on there the youngster
wanted to know

  making a trail count the mavericker
explained as the cattle are strung out
for the days drive the trail boss counts them
and his pardner does the same as each hun-
dred cows goes by he ties a knot in a lati-
go string or shifts a pebble from one pocket
to the other when the last cattle have

gone by the trail boss checks with his amigo
and if they have an agreement then theyre
satisfied if they dont check then theyve
got to go through the whole routine again
thats interesting the arbuckle re-
marked but by this time another fascinat-
ing branch of trail-herding was in the mak-
ing this was the job of putting the cattle
across the river the old-timer noticed the
direction of the youngsters glance and said
now youre going to see something
the cowboy had a word for it	

theres two kinds of water so far as a trail
hand is concerned one of them is walking
water and the other one is swimming water

walking water is water that is shallow
enough to permit the animals to ford it with
their four feet on solid ground all the time
generally its a pretty easy job to put a herd
across such a stream when you come up
against swimming water however its an-
other thing entirely

  why is that inquired the greenhorn
well laughed the mavericker its one
of those times when a cow critter is likely
to try and prove why folks call him a dumb
animal when a cowboy came to a river
ford he always called it a crossing when
the point riders reach one of these like up
ahead here they start their point animals out
into the river this is one spot where a
good lead steer like twisty comes in handy
if you dont get the cattle used to the idea
of swimming straight across theyll begin to
double up thats the cowboys way of say-
ing that theyll go part way across then
angle back to the same shore from which
they started

        a tough question
what happens if the lead cattle do man-
age to double up in spite of everything the
riders can do inquired the youngster

  now thats a question that a good many
old-timers pondered for some time before
one of the smart ones like john chisholm
or charley goodnight figured it out like
you know you can lead a horse to water
even though you cant make him drink so
it was a cinch to bring up the remuda
start the horses swimming across the pesky
stream and sure enough them cattle had no
hankering to be left behind so they up and
plunged in to see could they beat the horses
to the other side

  the arbuckle chuckled at this explana-
tion but he could readily see how it would
be much easier to handle the horses in the
water than the cattle

  as they watched the cattle moved across
the river without any untoward happening
when they topped a rise on the far side and

the wagons were safely across the cookie
and the wrangler waved farewell to the
old-timer and the greenhorn the two
men sat their horses and watched the rising
dust that marked the passage of the trail-
herd

the trail cutter

  then as they turned to ride leisurely back
to the ranch the mavericker said

  there are a lot of other interesting terms
and incidents that crop up on a trail drive
for one thing theres the rep or trail cut-
ter he has a downright interesting job

  whats a rep inquired the lad

  thats another case where your waddy is
saving syllables remarked the oldster at
a roundup or a trail drive every large ranch
or cattle association had a representative
briefly referred to as a rep at the roundup
it was his job to see that the cattle belonging
to his boss were properly branded and set
aside for the benefit of the owner on a trail
drive it was the job of the rep or the trail
cutter to stop a moving herd and look over
the cattle to make sure that they were all
properly branded and didnt belong to mem-
bers of the group for which he was rep-
ping 

  that sounds as though it would be quite
a job declared the arbuckle i should
think some of the big trail drives would
ride right over these trail cutters and not
listen to them

  sometimes they did for a fact the old
mossy-horn agreed but it didnt always
pay to do that for one thing a rancher
had to make one or two drives each year to
keep in funds and if a trail-herd refused to
be cut going north there was no telling
what might happen when the rannies were
coming back south with a sackful of dinero
to pay for their trouble

trimming the herd

  the pilgrim could see the justice of this
and listened while his mentor explained he
mechanics of cutting out cattle that had
been picked up on the trail this activity
on the part of the trail cutter and his men
was known as trimming the herd or cut-
ting the herd the groups of cattle were
run off the trail into bunches called cutter
herds these were held by the stock asso-
ciation reps or trail cutters until they
were claimed by their owners or could be
driven to their home range

  on most of the important trails cutter
herds were maintained about a hundred
miles apart cowboys who looked after these
exciting western



herds were paid a pro-rata share of their
wages by all of the ranchers represented in
the herd

  are the trail cutters the only ones who
move in on these drives the youngster
wanted to know

  nowadays thats about all a trail driver
has to worry about explained the old-timer
because the drives are shorter and dont
have to look for as much trouble as they
did in the old days

  he then went on to tell about the shot-
gun quarantines and other handicaps put
up by cattlemen or settlers anxious to pre-
vent cattle from texas from going up into
kansas and spreading the dreaded texas
fever or tick fever as we more familiarly
know it some of the folks could be con-
vinced that the cattle fever wasnt peculiar
to the folks from texas but then they merely
changed the name to spanish fever or
southern fever

fox-fire

  the tenderfoot made a note of these terms
then tried to recall some of the other words
he had heard exchanged between the range
riders on the trail and at the ranch finally
he said whats fox-fire

  fox-fire repeated the mavericker
why thats the cowboys equivalent of st
elmos fire or the fata morgana its the
phosphorescent light that comes up on a
cows horns and bobs about his ears during
an electrical storm its enough to scare the

cattle plumb to death not to mention what
it did to some of the poor ignorant cowboys
of the old days now that we know what
its all about we can laugh about it
lightning explained the old-timer was
another thing that plumb scared a riding cow-
boy on a trail drive he figured that it was
not only going to accompany the thunder
that would scare his dogies into a stampede
but he was sure that lightning was going to
strike him dead many a cowboy left his

spurs and six-gun behind him because he
was afraid theyd attract the lightning like
as not the same ranny would go right along
with a cartridge belt full of brass-cased car-
tridges and you know that brass and copper
are even better conductors of electricity than
iron is

more for the lexicon

  the youngster chuckled at this then he
looked at his notebook and asked

  what do these words mean a lay-up
a lay-over a dry drive and injun ran-
som 

  the old-timer puffed pleasantly on his pipe
and gigged his horse with blunted spurs be-
fore he replied

  those are good words for your lexicon
son and theyre plumb easy to answer a
lay-up was the stopping of a drive com-
pletely for some important reason there
might have been a bankful river or a drought
or anything else that threatened to destroy
the herd if it continued a lay-over was a
short stop during a drive sometimes it was
done to permit the cattle to feed on good
grass other times it was done to dip ani-
mals against tick fever or there might have
been many similar reasons a dry drive was
one where the cattle had to travel from one
end to the other without water naturally
it was hard on the stock and wasnt done
very often unless absolutely necessary prob-
ably the most famous dry drive in cattle
history was charley goodnights drive out
into new mexico

  and the injun ransom the lad re-
minded him

  well explained the mavericker often
during the drives across the old indian ter-
ritory a chief and a couple of braves would
hold up a trail drive the wise trail boss
would turn over several head of cattle for the
indians they never took more than they
could use because indians werent wasters
that was your injun ransom 

  by this time they were back in sight of
the ranch-house the pilgrim was saddle-
weary but convinced that the journey had
been well worth while

  the mavericker promised to fill out any
other items regarding trail-herding in an eve-
ning chat before steering the pilgrim into
another field of western language i hope
youll join them when they take up this sub-
ject next issue

crisis on the curly q

by don alviso

 stew tylers bout with red-eye brings on no pink elephants
 but he shore has a run-in with some man-eating mushrooms

dark and dreary thoughts filled
the so-called mind of stew ty-
ler cook from the curly q as he
rode slowly homeward on the bare back
of heavy plodding tom he was leading
jerry the other half of the wagon team

  there is no remorse so bitter he was
thinking that the misery of a screaming
hangover can not make it more galling
and no conscience so bruised that throb-
bing temples blurring eyes and a fever-
parched tongue will not rub salt into the
wounds

  though stew tyler would have used
more simple and more profane words he
was reflecting seriously on the qualities
of remorse as he tried to explain the sit-
uation to the wide-rumped heavy-hocked
draught horse

  it wasnt the whisky that done it
tom stew said aloud and the plodding
horse cocked one ear back it was them
five beers i drunk right after finishin off
the second bottle of kentucky dew then
i started home and got so doggone sleepy
i couldnt set up on the wagon seat no


exciting western



more and when i stops and lays down on
the load for a little nap somehow or other
my quirly drops down between the stuff
and sets fire to the hay in the bottom of
the wagon

  then this hoss-shoe rider comes along
just in time to unhook jiou and jerry and
drag me offn the wagon and now the
wagon is burned up and sos all the grub
and worst of all the coffee and flapjack
flour and syrup is gone too and like as
not goin without both his flapjacks and
coffee on sunday momin the boss un-
digestion is on him agin and no tellin
what he might do

  it was monday afternoon the previous
saturday morning jed bonnette owner
of the curly q had sent his cook with the
team and wagon to calico to buy and bring
back a load of supplies the fall roundup
had lasted longer than expected and sup-
plies on the ranch had run low in fact
the curly q had been out of flapjack
flour for a week and the last of the coffee
had been used saturday morning

  jed bonnette was a man of simple tastes
who ate in the grub shack with his men
but jed had to have four cups of hot black
coffee every morning and on sunday
mornings he had to have flapjacks and
syrup with his coffee jed claimed that
any deviation from this sunday morning
diet brought on terrible attacks of indiges-
tion other things could bring on jeds
indigestion too such as his crew tearing
up a saloon on a saturday night spree a
tough bronc throwing him or the time
when his prized angus bull got mired
down in the swamp

  and every time jed got an attack of in-
digestion his temper became very sour
and it was all hank bodie the foreman
and the rest of the crew could do to keep
him from strapping on his other gun and
riding over to shoot it out with the mc-
wades on mud creek

cal mcwade and his son sam ran
a two-bit spread in the foot hills over
west of the curly q jed had known for
years that the mcwades filched an oc-
casional dogie from the curly q beef that
grazed in the canyons south of mcwades
range but when jeds stomach wasnt
upset he didnt fret too much about the
mcwades petty rustling

  a dogie now and then aint goin to
break us jed would say and let it go at
that

  but whn toma real crisis hit him such

as lack of coffee or flapjacks jeds stom-
ach would turn over and he would im-
mediately become convinced that the mc-
wades had got their ropes on everything
on the curly q under two years of age
he would be ready alone and single-
handed to ride over and blast it out with
cal and sam the bad part of it was that
cal mcwade was a bad hombre with a
record down along the rio and his shifty-
eyed son showed promise of being anoth-
er of the same the good part of it was
that so far in one way or another the
curly q crew had been able to keep jed
at home during each crisis until his in-
digestion had passed

  remembering all this only added to
stew tylers remorse and bruised his
conscience more in his mind there was
the gory picture of the boss lying dead
with both mcwades pumping more lead
into his lifeless body but the sound of a
galloping horse coming toward him
brought stew out of his miserable rev-
erie a moment later hank bodie pulled
up and glared at stew

  well stupid he shouted  what dog-
gone bonehead trick have yuh pulled now
moseyin back two days late ridin tom
and leadin jerry with no wagon and no
grub id ought to shoot yuh right here
if yuh was worth a bullet so talk fast
before i get wasteful and do it anyhow

  stew tyler passed a red-hot tongue
over cracked and burning lips lifted blood-
shot eyes to meet hanks enraged gaze
then hung his head

  well hank it was like this he com-
menced lamely soon as i got into town
saturday i went right to mcfees store
like the boss said i looked over his stock
and bought the grub and mcfee bein
in a generous mood which is rare for a
scot gives me a bottle of kentucky dew
well it bein awful dry out and a hot
afternoon besides i starts samplin the gift
while mcfees man loads the wagon it
was one of them deceivin bottles with a
big dent in the bottom and first thing i
knew it was empty

  you know how it is hank that sam-
ple tasted so good i goes down to the
trail saloon and orders up another just
like it well as the sayin goes time stag-
gered by and fore i realized it that bot-
tle was gone and it was gettin to be eve-
nin and i starts out of the trail but
right at the door who should i meet but
slip harney from the six point star and
slip says lets have a beer so i had a
crisis on the curly q	

few beers with slip and that was what
done it

  i starts for home and gets so sleepy i
couldnt stick on the wagon seat it was
buckin so i was so sleepy i didnt know
i had lit a quirly and still had it in my
mouth and when i stops and lays down on
the load for a little bit of a nap-well the
wagon ketches fire and a hoss-shoe rider
comes along and unhooks the team and
takes them and me back to town i was
so sleepy i didnt get my sleep out till way
late sunday afternoon and by then it was
rainin pitchforks and papooses so i stays
over in calico last night bein bad in need
of a handful of hair from the hound which
bit me is the boss purty mad hank

  hank was still glaring

 mad hes as wild as a washwoman
with her hair caught in the clothes ringer
he stomped around most of the day yes-
terday waitin for yuh to show up with his
coffee and flapjacks he was so mad he
tromped on his cats tail plumb on pur-
pose and then he begins cussin about his
indigestion and threatenin to ride over
and wipe out the mcwades

  when yuh hadnt showed up by mid-
night last night i sneaked into his room
and got his guns and hid em and limpy
hid his saddle and bridle then me and
the boys drove the remuda from the corral
way up into the canyon and i told the
boys to stay clear of the house and watch
you know how jed is when he gets one
of these spells hes set on goin to mc-
wades alone and if he does theyll kill
him shore

  but like as not hes found his irons by
now and has mebbe caught up a steer and
is ridin him bareback headed for mc-
wades and its all yore fault you-you
- hank bodie being a careful man
could not find the proper word to finish

  stew tyler licked his parched lips
again im sorry hank i-i-

 oh shut up hank snapped and
spurred past stew and the team swinging
left toward the foothills and mcwades

  the cook now feeling worse than ever
plodded miserably on toward the ranch

  after sunday nights rain the air was
heavy with moisture and the sun was
shining brightly it was a lovely fall af-
ternoon but it meant nothing to stew
tyler except that the strong light hurt his
throbbing eyes then a mile from the
ranchhouse where the trail dipped down
across the tree-lined creek something
small and round and white under the trees

on the creek bank caught stews atten-
tion he pulled tom to a halt and sat still
a moment blinking then as an idea
slowly and painfully took shape in his
mind some of the dejected misery left his
face and a shrewd light came into his
eyes

  mushrooms he murmured nice and
purty and tender cornin out after the
rain and if theres anything the boss
likes better than flapjacks its a nice big
steak smothered in mushrooms

ith a suddenly acquired agility
stew scrambled down off toms
broad back and ran to the spot on the
creek bank tearing off his hat as he ran

  look at em must me two dozen or
more and tender as a kittens nose aint
been up moren two three hours

  with a tenderness suited to the occasion
stew picked the mushrooms placing them
one by one in the crown of his hat when
the hat was full he knotted together the
comers of his bandanna to hold the rest
then he was back on tom holding the
bandanna in his left hand and balancing
the upturned hat in the curve of his arm
he kicked toms ribs with his spurless
heels and slapped him with the reins

  giddap yuh lazy old hay chopper
mebbe we only got minutes to save the
boss life

 when stew reached the ranch yard
he didnt stop at the cook shack but rode
straight on to the corral jed bonnette
was there busily lenghtening the stirrup
straps and letting out the cinches of an old
saddle to fit a fat old mare which evidently
had been the only mount he could catch
afoot jed had found his guns and wore
them now he just threw the cook one
scorching glance and returned his at-
tention to the saddle

  stew tried to think of just the right
thing to say but couldnt think at all
boss i- he began

  yuhre fired jed snapped get off
that hoss and roll yore rags and get out
of my sight

  stew felt a cold chill run along his
spine he got off tom carefully so he
wouldnt crush or spill the precious mush-
rooms but instead of heading for the
bunkhouse he edged closer to the corral
poles and tried again

  boss i-im sorry about the wagon
and the grub and especially about the
coffee and flapjack flour but look i
brought yuh some mushrooms nice ten-
exciting western



der ones too just come up after the
rain

  jed pulled so viciously on the cinch lace
that the fat old mare groaned

  yuhre fired jed shouted again ob-
viously too angry to grasp the meaning
of the harnesses team  with no wagon
behind get away from me quick be-
fore i gun yuh or somethin you- he
turned to look at stew with one eye half-
closed eh mushrooms did yuh say
the cooks face brightened with hope
he almost fell between the corral poles
and held out his hat with its precious car-
go for jeds inspection

  look the kind yuh like best too and
ill fry em with two of the biggest ten-
derest steaks off the steer up in the ice
cellar

  jed gave the mushrooms a hungrily ap-
praising inspection then turned to look
over the mares back toward the foot hills
and me wades

  man cant fight on an empty stomach
he murmured then snapped well fry
em up what the devil yuh standin wait-
in for if i get some decent vittles in my
stomach i may feel better if i dont im
ridin over on mud crick

  stew ran toward the kitchen yelling
for limpy burke his helper

  build up the fire limpy quick then
get me two nice big front quarter steaks
off that steer the boys butchered friday
hurry now

  limpy built up the fire and while stew
carefully cleaned and washed the mush-
rooms limpy hobbled up to the ice cellar
after the steaks later with the steaks siz-
zling in two hot frying pans and while
stew sliced in crisp sections of mush-
rooms on top limpy looked on with glum
disapproval it was obvious that he was
in little better humor than the boss stew
knew that the reason for this was that
limpy had been forced to cook for the
crew during his own two-day spree in
calico

  how yuh know thems mushrooms and
not poison toadstools limpy asked
sourly how yuh know anyhow

  i know because i read a book on em
stew snapped positively and besides
aint i cooked steak and mushrooms for
the boss before yuh think id feed em
to the boss if i wasnt shore and mebbe
poison him

  well could be limpy shrugged
yuh dont look none too steady and yore
eyes is purty blurry an its been a long

time ago yuh read this book besides i
just heard jed fire yuh-an yuh could
mebbe be mistook this time on purpose
or otherwise

 stew made a swing at him with the
hot-cake turner he was using to stir the
mushrooms

  get out of here yuhre just sore thats
all cause yuh had to do a little work for
a change while i was gone now git

  limpy sullenly left the kitchen but
the gloom he had spread remained be-
hind him like many careful mushroom
hunters stew tyler had thoroughly
learned to identify three or four edible
species and he stuck to these never tak-
ing a chance on any other variety which
he did not know he had been very sure
about these particular fungi when he had
picked them down by the creek but
limpys skepticism had done something
to his sureness stew began to worry
his eyes had been throbbing pretty bad-
ly on the ride home and they had played
tricks on him making him see things in
the trail that werent there now he wished
he had examined the mushrooms again
more closely after he had washed them
and before he had cut them up now they
were half fried and it was too late the
identifying marks were gone

  theyre good-i know they are he
told himself its just that darned limpys
spiteful talk

but stew was still worried he
stirred the frying mushrooms so vig-
orously that several pieces spilled from
the skillet and dropped to the floor he
let them lay until he had salted and pep-
pered the two big steaks and turned them
over in the pans

  then jed bonnettes big pet tomcat
bluey came rubbing up against his legs
and stew remembered the pieces of mush-
room on the floor he picked them up
and found they had cooled so he carried
them to the back porch where blueys
dish always stood the cat followed him
hungrily stew dropped the pieces of
mushroom into blueys dish and hurried
back to tend the steaks

  as soon as he had the boss fed he would
have to rummage around and find some-
thing for the crew and hurry to get sup-
per ready not a man save limpy and
the boss had been in sight when stew
had reached home but the other riders
would be drifting in soon and wanting
their supper stew put a big platter into
crisis on the curly q	

the oven to warm then set out a fork
and a sharp knife and bread and catsup
on the chow table just as jed bonnette
stamped in

  whats keepin yuh jed growled
wheres them mushrooms and steaks

  cornin right up boss stew assured
him soon as i dish em up

  as stew slid the steaks onto the hot
platter and edged them around with crisp
brown mushroom slices the aroma which
drifted up to his nostrils made his mouth
water when he carried the platter in and
set it before jed the boss could remain
glum for only a moment as the irresis-
tible food smell came to him his face
broke into its habitual broad smile

  stew stayed near just long enough to see
jed reach for knife and fork and catsup
bottle all at the same time and then
knowing when silence is most golden he
hurried out to the almost bare storeroom
to see what he could find for the crews
supper

  after some rummaging around he found
a part of a sack of potatoes and that was
all well he would send limpy up after
more steaks with bread and fried po-
tatoes that would have to do he forgot
limpys gloomy talk and the worry it had
caused him

  but as he started up onto the porch on
the wav back to the kitchen stew stopped
abruptly there not ten feet from his
empty dish lay bluey stretched out mo-
tionless and still stew looked at the emp-
ty dish again then back at bluey he
dropped the potato sack as if his hands
were suddenly frozen

  he could hear the sound of knife and
fork against the platter as jed sitting at
one end of the long table inside ate his
steak and mushrooms with gusto sud-
denly a bewildered and hunted look came
into stew tylers eyes walking as quiet-
ly as he could he hurried into the kitchen
tearing off his apron on the way

  grabbing paper and pencil from the
shelf behind the stove he scrawled a hasty
note and stuck it to the fly paper on the
door as he went out the note read

  limpy burke is a liar and i didnt poison the
boss on purpose if jed lives long enough please
tell him i am sorry about bluey i had nothin
agin the cat or the boss either and this was jist
a accident the same as the wagon and the grub
burnin up so long	stew tyler

  stew grabbed his hat from the peg by
the door after a cautious glance over the

yard to be sure no one was around he
raced to the corral where the fat mare
still stood saddled and bridled stew
mounted and rode out of the corral but
he didnt go through the yard past the
cook shack

  he circled the corral and back of the
barn heading for the nearest willows on
the creek

  he put the willow-bordered creek be-
tween him and the curly q ranchhouse
and headed up the canyon which ran south
of mcwades place when hank bodie
and the crew with maybe the sheriff
along started out after him they wouldnt
figure him going this way it was known
on the curly q that once in town cal mc-
wade had given stew a pretty bad scare
and hank would guess that the cook would
be afraid to ride so close to mcwades
even when he was running away

 as he pushed the lazy mare up the
canyon all of stews misery was back
upon him and more first the wagon and
the grub had burned up now bluey was
dead and the boss would die too if he
wasnt dead already again stew was
hearing limpy burke saying in that posi-
tive tone yuh could be mistook-on
purpose or otherwise

  stew suddenly found himself hating
limpy burke the boys would be com-
ing in for supper now and they would
find bluey and they would find the boss
dead maybe sitting right at the table with
some of the mushrooms left on the platter
to tell the tale and if any more telling
was needed limpy would take care of
that it would be a plain case of a man
being fired for carelessness and drunken-
ness and then for revenge poisoning the
man who had fired him

  stew kicked harder at the fat side of
the mare no he doubted that hank
bodie would wait to pick up the sheriff
in spite of his infrequent surges of temper
when the indigestion was upon him jed
bonnette was the best boss a man ever
saw he was very much liked yes even
loved and respected by every man on the
curly q and hank bodie and the crew
would make short work of the skunk who
had poisoned their boss

  stew shivered and tried to prod the
mare into more speed he knew how an
outlaw felt now this was what it was like
to be a killer hunted friendless and al-
ways on the run
exciting western



darkness came and stew still
pushed on up the canyon with no
thought of cal mcwade and his renegade
son farther on the canyon split three
ways and if he could make it to the fork
before they caught up with him maybe he
could throw them off time after time
stew heard sounds behind him which he
was sure was his pursuers but when he
stopped to listen he could hear nothing

  when he reached the forks he couldnt
decide which trail to take and suddenly
realized how tired and weary he was this
had been a very hard day a bad day and
now it was getting late probably past
midnight it was too dark to see the
hands of his watch and stew was afraid to
light a match he decided on the left hand
fork turned that way and pushed on

  he rode on for an hour then caught
himself dropping off to sleep in the sad-
dle he decided that perhaps he had
thrown his pursuers off at the fork and
now dared to stop for a little nap

  he found a place for the mare under
some low overhanging limbs and a place
for himself beside a giant fallen pine
the night was cold but weariness lay so
heavily upon stew that he fell asleep soon
after making himself comfortable in his
bed of leaves

  how long he had slept he did not know
when he was awakened by a rough hand
shaking him he sat up sleepily but came
fully awake with a start when he recogniz-
ed hank bodies voice

  wake up stew its hank me and
the boys have come to take yuh in

  well stew thought it had to come
some time might as well be now it
would save him lonely years riding the
owlhoot on the back trails now that his
end had come he would be brave about
it even if he was only the cook he would
show them he could die like a man

  all right hank he said getting to
his feet i wont give yuh no trouble i
got just one favor to ask yuh though if
its all the same to you make this a shoot-
in party stead of a hangin i got a ten-
der throat and i never could stand any-
thing tight around my neck

 from somewhere behind the foreman
came the sound of harsh laughter hank
reached out and caught stews shoulder
in a steely grip

  say-what kind of talk yuh givin us
yuh still drunk whats this shootin and
hangin stuff

 well stew muttered miserably
blueys dead i saw him and if three
little bitty pieces of them poison mush-
rooms would kill bluey the boss is prob-
ably dead by now and i dont blame you
boys for wantin to string me up i feel
like shootin myself i would if i had a
gun

  more laughter came from the farther
darkness and now hank let out a loud
whoop

  gosh he said when he could stop
laughing long enough to talk limpy
shore had yuh scared didnt he he tried
to give me the same story but them
mushrooms wasnt poison stew in fact
old jed said its the best meal he ever
ate and he felt so good after he had it
inside of him he forgot about the mc-
wades and didnt even get mad when i
told him about the wagon and grub burn-
in up i sent one of the boys over to the
hoss-shoe to borrer some coffee and flap-
jack flour for breakfast and jed is sendin
limpy into town after another load of
grub tomorrer soon as i heard limpys
talk and saw yore note i figgered how
yore mind was workin so me and a
couple of the boys came after yuh

  b-but the cat stew blurted bluey
i saw him layin still and dead there in
the yard

  dead nothin hank chuckled when
the boss tromped on blueys tail sunday
bluey took off like a calf from a hot
brandin iron he stayed out all night and
all day and come back tired out after
he et them mushrooms limpy came along
from the cow barn and give him a drink of
warm milk so then bluey just stretched
out for a nap like cats will bluey and
jed is both in bed asleep right now and
both purrin too ill bet come along
stew yuh got to get up early to fry flap-
jacks in the mornin

    the agreement between paddy carney and cooney banks
    takes care of all fightin cheatin an spreein at poker tables

cooney banks had been up
for two hours when paddy car-
ney his partner rolled out of the
bunk and stumbled on bowed legs to the
glowing stove his blankets clutched to
his squat powerful frame

 whut yuh been doin darn yuh
paddy carney growled turning his back
so that the wood fire would have a gen-
erous target for its warmth these here

floors is coldern a bankers heart at mid-
night in a blizzard dont the agree-
ment operate both ways

  cooney sighed and turned the frying
bacon with a fork he saw that the coffee
water was boiling so he dumped in an
unmeasured quantity of grounds and
started stirring

  the agreement holds he murmured
im a man of my word




exciting western

  and so am i paddy snapped his
small blue eyes focused on his partner of
three months when i wuz on the short
end i had everythin nice an warm
now didnt i

  september in the high sierras aint
november in the high sierras cooney
said mildly his black spade beard un-
dulating like a gentle ocean swell as he
chewed his tobacco also whilst you
was workin the claim i wuz dropping
trees an cuttin heart timbers to shore
the diggins up proper also i laid in the
firewood i started openin the new
pocket an i terraced a path down to the
crick sos to make it easier to tote water
come this bad weather man nobody
around silverton has it nice as us
paddy glared and walked to the single
window that the shack boasted paddy
always managed to introduce the sub-
ject of the window a small four-paneled
affair whenever cooney started to de-
tail his share of the partnership work
it was upon this window that the part-
nership had been founded

months before paddy carney ar-
rived in silverton cooney banks
had staked out a claim across the valley
from fabulous virginia city cooney
was working it when along came paddy
with his sturdy legs his sparkling irish
wit and his will to work and also that
window frame

  the gang in the last chance saloon
had roared their mirth at the sight of
paddy-blocky red-haired mustached
he was dressed in faded levis fish-oiled
boots and a hooded windbreaker with a
red bandanna for a head piece

  he carried the framed glass in one
hand and his bedding roll in the other
he let it be known that he was looking
for a partner to work a claim

  cooney banks friendly amusement
touching his dark eyes had bought the
vagrant paddy a drink then sized him
up asking about the window

  all i gotta do the weary traveler
confided is build me a shack around this
here window and im set of course i
gotta get me a claim too its also nice
to have a burro an maybe some vittles
laid in for the bad season then too its
fittin to have some animals to haul the
ore to the mill but im just about fixed
with this here window as a starter
cooney had what the window should
go into that was a shack cooney also

had a claim a burro some vittles laid in
and a way to get his ore to the mill he
had thoughtfully hacked out a road with
his ax biting through the firs he had
laboriously rolled rock down the slope to
the rude trail and fashioned it so that
a teamster could get through to the ore
by riding his wheels on the stepping-
stones of rock

  cooney had had a need for a partner
and a hunkering for company he saw
how it was with the not-so-young paddy
carney and he figured he could brighten
up his shack with that window so they
struck the agreement it was put down
on paper and entered into solemnly with
little talk there were long spaces of
silence that stretched the words out

  the agreement was cooneys idea but
to give paddy the right of it he hadnt
cottoned to it at first

  now pardner the burly little paddy
had protested his blue eyes troubled i
never wuz a double-yoke man meself i
alius travel light fast an unhindered
mebbe wed best take it easy an work
this thing out

  no cooney had overruled him this
here workin idee-the agreement i
calls it-should make us satisfied no
matter what therell alius be a boss
therell alius be work done an therell
alius be turn about makin fer fair play
another good thing pardners can tie
theirselves up each arguin with the
other this way no arguments but mind
its strictly between you n me it dont
let everybody into yore affairs

  for a time paddy carney was a bless-
ing to the lonely cooney banks in a
poker game the burly paddy won a
guitar and a tambourine from an itiner-
ant medicine-show man cooney had
been astonished and delighted when
paddy played the stringed instrument
with skillful if blunt and calloused
fingers paddy raised his voice in a tenor
that would have been lyrical if the in-
roads of rot-gut whisky hadnt blurred it
some

  paddys wit and his amusing conver-
sations with the king as he chris-
tened their patient and plodding burro
had cooney in roars of laughter but
black moods would descend on the
dwarfed giant of an irishman moods
that were spaced at first and then closer
and closer together

  cooney thought he knew what it was

  the man has led a peculiar life he
men of their word	

saw it partnerless an with terrific
sprees now an then to space out his
spells o loneliness its growin on him
he wants to bust loose but it is in the
agreement that no one o us should
spend whilst we are still searchin fer the
true vein hes a man of his word but
its chawin him up inside somethin
terrible

in accordance with the agree-
ment cooney had done the labor for
a spell while paddy got accustomed to
the high altitude of the area and of the
claim cooney swung the pick into an
angle of the diggings that had made him
thoughtful more than once paddy
watching him with his bright blue eyes
perplexed made a suggestion

  sure an ye swing the pick like a true
gandy dancer but aint ye wastin time
too now that streak o silver over here
its my idea we should be workin that i
grant ye we can use more room espe-
cially with yer height

 there was no argument about it
cooney smilingly shifted his operations
to the small but steadily paying vein of
silver that had first atracted him to the
claim

 when enough ore had eventually
been worked out by the burro and piled
high for the ore wagons cooney
dropped the pick and the shovel and took
the kings bridle paddy moved in his
huge arms working for endless hours as
he addressed himelf to the vein of silver

  cooney soon suggested now like i
was doin the first day paddy work the
corner there in the back awhile

  an what in the name of the saints
for paddy had bristled is it workin
for fun that ye think i am man im
workin the pay dirt not excavatin fer
no whim

  cooney could have pressed it but he
didnt instead he took a generous chaw
of his plug and sat with his thoughts
then he shouldered the saw hefted the
ax and the dogwood wedges and went
into the woods for more timber

  he terraced the drop to the creek al-
though it was not in the agreement for
him to do so he worked the road to the
claim so that the ore wagons would find
it easier to negotiate and would come
more willingly and for less money that
wasnt in the agreement for him to do
either

  he stacked wood in the lean-to erected

on the side of the shack and he stacked
dried and cut wood inside where it
would be handy for paddy to get at that
wasnt in the agreement but his work
seemed only to increase paddys trucu-
lence and to bring on dark moods more
and more often until at last it was rare
that a pleasant word passed between the
two

  then came cooneys turn to go back
into the diggings it was then that paddy
would lie awake long in the night his
grunting and muttering audible to
cooney paddy would arise late in the
morning and start finding fault the in-
stant his bare flat feet touched the cold
floor

  it served only to infuriate him the
more when he found that cooney had
been up hours had been to the diggings
had returned to bring up the pot-bellied
stoves warmth and had the breakfast of
bacon fried hominy beans and coffee
ready

  yeve been goin to silverton a lot of
late cooney now said as he stirred the
coffee mayhap it would be better if ye
stayed overnight

  paddy glowered stamping his feet to
warm them are you inferrin pardner
that im likely to tie one on git drunk
is it that maybe

  cooney shot a glance at him well
now i didnt make mention of it

  im keepin my part of the agree-
ment paddy growled he went still
his eyes squinting out the window at the
trail huh

  cooney ladled out a taste of coffee
and grimaced see somethin

  an if i do or i dont it is me own
window through which i do or dont
aint it the little irishman blared he
turned to face cooney yere spoilin
fer a fight aint ye

  for answer cooney sighed and un-
laced his boots under paddys watchful
gaze then he carefully kicked the two
homemade chairs out of the way rolled
up the sleeves of his wool shirt and spat
on his hands invitingly

paddy came forward in a crouch
breathing in a whistle through his
teeth his small eyes glinting with battle
he was circling warily when cooney
dropped his loosely held guard and
raised a hand palm-outward

 hold the lanky bearded cooney
banks cried afore we start this pard-
	exciting

ner mebbe yed like to check the ore i
piled up a good bit of it whilst yeve been
lyin around belly-achin

   paddy made some suggestions all im-
 practical if not impossible about what
 disposition cooney could make of his
 blankety-blank ore and he came in
 swinging

   neither man saw the two heads that
 poked cautiously up for a view of the
 inmates of the shack

   cooney was too busy trying to save a
 leg from the prostrate irishmans maul-
 ing toe-hold paddy was occupied
 equally well with figuring some way to
 get cooneys foot out of his mouth since
 biting didnt seem to work the trick

   they fought like gentlemen with
 their shoes off but it was doubtful if
 the toughest sole could have been more
 bruising than paddys vigorous kicks or
 cooneys skillful butts to the midriff

 they fought to the four corners of
 the room they fought past the stove and
 back into it a scream of rage came from
 paddy when he contacted the glowing
 iron sides with his not-so-iron stern in
 getting away from the blistering stove
 paddy managed to spill the lethal black
 and hot coffee onto cooneys bare feet

   the blasting blows each had struck
 tempered the cabin-fever hatred of the
 two thus there was little rancor left in
 the men when the common pain of burns
 seared through their homicidal intent
 and turned their minds to more pressing
 needs

   cooney shoved paddy back and
 grabbed for the slab of bacon hanging
 by a cord cooney cut strips to rub the
 fatty stuff onto his feet

   who is boss paddy yelled gimme
 that bacon ow ow me sainted mother
 come to me aid this devil has fair
 burnt the skin off me posterity gimme
 the bacon drat ye banks

   and the agreement was such that
 cooney banks straightened and passed
 paddy carney the bacon

   now make me more coffee paddy
 roared when the bacon fat was clapped
 to his stinging stern begorrah this
 settles it its action ill take before an-
 other sun rises on that hole of a claim
 its tired i am of havin the likes of ye
 forever pesterin me its action ill
 take

   cooney shrugged take yore blasted
 window too its about all yuh ever
 brought anyway

western

  and he was instantly sorry when he
saw the hurt look in paddys blue eyes
but it had been said and that was that

 for answer paddy howled who is
boss who has the say

 you cooney said eyes worried
now if yuhll come to the ore pit-
no orders paddy roared not
from ye its me thats callin the tune
me bucko fix me coffee an then its
out to the diggins with ye and yell
work where i marked an not skulk
aroun in the off corner of the shaft like
ive caught ye doin

  cooney shrugged and was thoughtful
he walked to the window and looked out
at the sky he was turning away when
something caught his eyes he stopped

  aint that dee souders an jakey
moore goin away down the trail
paddy made as if to start over then
checked it

  ye may see for yerself through me
own window he growled wiping the
blood from his split lips with the hem
of his nightshirt like as not theyre
checkin on one of the loans theyve
made to the boys farther along he
sipped some coffee from his tin mug
dee souders is a canny poker player
cooney twisted his head to look at
paddy thats one way of callin it
he said you been hangin around with
him an moore watch them two pad-
dy theyre slick

  who is boss paddy asked disdain-
fully

 you but-

  then let the hired help stop givin
orders paddy said to work with ye
now an mind ye work the part i say
an should ye find me gone when ye re-
turn dont delay supper for me

although cooneys eyes were
worried he didnt say anything
he ate his bacon hominy and beans as
well as his swollen jaw would let him
then sloshed down the coffee and got his
socks and boots on again

  he went slowly to the claim as if hop-
ing paddy would call out to stop him
but paddy didnt cooney opened the
door of the shed where they stabled the
king he soon led the beast past the ore
pit to the mouth of the diggings

  he stared into the fuzzy-gray of the
sky where mount rose and mount pea-
vine thrust their snow-capped shoulders
into the clouds he knew he would have
men of their word	

to work fast snow was coming

  he was working up a scoop of ore to
the pit when paddy came out bundled
to the ears against the cold paddy hur-
ried along the trail to the well-beaten
ore road that led to other diggings in
the area

  he was a small spot on the snow-laden
horizon when cooney looked again a
spot that receded toward silverton and
the last chance saloon there paddy
would find dee souders and jakey
moore and other sharpsters who toiled
not nor did they spin yet they came
out with a good profit month after
month   

  the last chance was at its roaring
worst paddy carney was soon match-
ing it paddy was the life of the party
paddy was buying

  how he worked cooney out of that
claim beats me cash garnett said as he
looked over at the inebriated irishman
and poured another set of drinks for
paddys friends paddy is no liar if
he says he is the boss hes boss dee
and jakey claim to have inside informa-
tion that cooney is workin for him just
like a chinaman taking orders like a
waiter beats me but there it is

  it beat dee souders and jakey moore
too but they were satisfied with their
good luck if not with the cause of their
windfall stories had come up from
the stanp mill about the high grade of
the banks-carney ore souders and
moore had thought long and covetously
about that claim and about how to
change the name of it from banks-car-
ney to souders-moore

  they had gone out to have a talk with
the two rough and lonely miners some-
times a loan could be embarrassing to
pay back sometimes the thought of co-
pious supplies of food was enough to
turn the trick sometimes they could
drive a wedge of discontent between two
partners and do it that way

  they had arrived at the banks-carney
claim in time to see a fight that was epic
and in time to hear things that made
them happy

 paddy carney was the boss from
cooneys own lips they had heard it
acknowledged when the lank bearded
man had asked his partner to come to the
ore pit the burly irishman had told
him off

  im boss its in the agreement

  as the crooks had foreseen the irish-

man his black mood riding him and his
emotional upset over his fight with his
partner goading him further would soon
wander to town then they would have
their chance and would make their play

  their cup was full to overflowing
when the impressionable irishman
showed up within hours of the fight his
eyes angry his mouth swollen an ear
torn and a chip on his shoulder

  when he refused a drink it was dee
souders who said i thought you were
boss paddy does that sour man out
there tell you what to do arent you
boss

 paddy glared am i boss am i
hey cash a double rye straight with
another double rye chaser an have
some more handy me boy oh ho am i
boss

  there was ready money from dee an
i o u when paddy wanted to buy
there was more money for a friendly
game and more money and more
money

  drinks for the house raise you two
hundred double ryes double ryes me
boy set em up again ill raise ye
three hundred double ryes

 dee and jakey were rich men when
they went to bed after thoughtfully
stowing paddy under one of the beds
and tying his leg to a bedpost

cooney was standing in the mine
entrance when they all came up in
dees wagon jakey was smoking a long
cigar dee was driving with the air of
a proprietor paddy flushed and defiant
was also a bit distressed

 good news cooney jakey said
along the barrel of his cigar his mouth
trying to grin and his eyes freezing it
before it was quite born paddy drove
a shrewd bargain when he sold out to us
now yuh can go back to silverton an
live like a gent

  were takin over dee confirmed it
getting down and looping the reins
around a wheel spoke he made a neat
tie of it i think well move a gang
right in an really get the works goin

  cooney stared long at paddy but the
irishman wasnt meeting his gaze

  paddy how much do you owe them
cooney asked

  none o yer business paddy carney
tried to work his old rage back up again
im boss what i say- but he
couldnt hold it his voice broke and
smooth sailing with

 he said cooney i was drunk

   cooney nodded his eyes turning to
 jakey and dee he went inside the
 shack when he came out again he had
 his gun belt strapped on and the holster
 flap was laid back against the need for
 anything

    dee souders blinked and shot a look at
  moore both men were very careful
  about their hands paddy got down from
  the wagon

   cooney paddy cried its ashamed
 i am i was mad an i did it its fair
 but it is hard and if it will make it any
 easier ill work fer ye fer life with no
 pay but me vittles an me bed sure an
 the black rage was on me i was boss
 ye shouldnt have let me go to town
 cooney not in the mood i was in not
 after the beatin ye gave me

   cooney banks grinned but he took
 care to step around paddy so he could
 watch dee and jakey moore

   the beating i gave you man im
 a wreck but about this thing you sold
 the claim

    id a right as boss didnt i cooney
  its the agreement

   cooney watched dee and jakey relax
 and he moved closer to the two of them

   yes paddy youd a right while you
 were boss but remember i told you to
 come to the ore pit

   paddy lifted his eyes away from
 cooney to look at the mound of metallic
 earth that was piled high and waiting
 for the ore wagons

   glory be he breathed he counted
 rapidly on his fingers it was three
 hundred ye owed the agreement he
 was so excited he was bubbling with it
 what then cooney

   i was close to bein boss when you
 walked out on me yesterday mornin
 cooney explained i didnt like the
 way yuh were actin an lookin paddy
 so i pitched in an ran out ore all the
 day an up to nine at night his gaze
 touched dee and jakey i didnt figure
 yuh could get him drunk that quick
 yuh see boys paddy made a little mis-
 take in not estimatin the ore i was
 boss here when he got to town not
 him

   you mean the deal we made with
 paddy is no good asked dee what
 is this you cant get away with that
 cooney he looked at jakey moore
 jakey keep your hands away from your
 
gun you havent a chance with banks
moore his hands changing their mind
and going higher said cooney we
heard you admit it to paddy yesterday
we heard you admit he was boss
paddy his eyes troubled said i gave
my word i gave my signature cooney
its hard but its fair i sold the claim
now ye can take the balance of the
money an im yer worker fer life ill
swear it

 hold it paddy cooney laughed
thats one i can hold yuh to i had
enough ore piled up so i was boss an
any deal yuh made with dee or with
moore was illegal

 dees frown was growing do you
mind explaining what this is all about
cooney im going to see a lawyer ive
had plenty of dealings with miners but
i never heard such a mix-up as this thing
you and your partner keep talking
about

  moore was still very careful

  yeah youre boss he said hes
boss youre boss now just who in
hades is boss

  cooney shrugged his dark eyes cheer-
ful but watchful

  it sure is a simple thing the agree-
ment yuh see i didnt want ol paddy
here to feel i was bein charitable to him
nor did i want him to think i didnt ap-
preciate his work paddy is a good
worker when his moods dont get onto
him so we made the agreement see
dee staring snapped put it plain an
clear cooney what was this agree-
ment

  well we figgered the claim might be
worth two thousand and five hundred
just for somethin to talk about so we
figgered what each ton of ore was worth
brought up one man working it at a
time to get it up to the pit was twenty
dollars labor usin the king see
the king moore asked his face
blank

 the burro paddy calls him the
king anyway it started with paddy
bein boss an me bringin the ore up un-
til i had brought up a hundred an fifty
ton then he owed me the cost of the
claim see then i was boss then he
went into the diggins and he brought it
up until i owed him the two thousan and
five hundred an then-

claim and he was boss

   yeah cooney said his eyes pleased
 with such understanding thats it
 simple huh well id just worked up
 enough ore so i was boss when paddy
 went away thinkin he was

  that dont hold water moore
snapped

  then yuh mean i was always the
owner cooney asked innocently

  dee souders groaned hes got us
 jakey if we claim his idea is no good
 then we prove that their whole agree-
 ment was never any good he faced
 cooney look will yuh make good the
 money we advanced paddy

  shore thing cooney said equably
 but not the poker money yuh probably
 rooked him outa paddy can pay you
 hisself outa this ore i got from a corner
 i been workin hell pay i wouldnt
 be partners with a man who wouldnt
 pay

  mad men dee souders breathed as
 he stumbled to the wagon reins untied
 them and motioned to moore to climb
 up one of them owns it now then an-
 other owns it and-then the other
 owns it

  saves labor disputes cooney said
 bluntly when the wagon was bouncing
 down the trail he turned to paddy i
 ought to whack yore ears off an me
 working that little bitty gold streak in
 the corner until i was sure i had a rich
 vein afore i told ye

  its yours paddy yelled i
wouldnt touch an ounce of it i been a
jackass i have a bull-headed jackass
with no brains about the biggest in the
world instead of appreciatin a good
partner-

   aw shut up an lets carry some nug-
 gets in cooney said i wants meat an
 -well we will see but i aim to have
 me a time celebratin a new agreement
 in fact i swore i would and we are
 men of our words aint we

  paddy was grinning when he went
into the shack and reached down his
dusty guitar

   he ran his fingers over the strings
 drew out a rich chord and matched it
 with his sweet voice

  paddy carney found it good to be a
 man of his word

our next issue

they are busy again-getting in trouble
up to their necks as usual tombstone
jones and speedy smith of course theyre
in bandit busters of war dance
the rib-tickling novel by w c tuttle which
is featured in the next issue of exciting
western

  tombstone had lost speedy and was look-
ing for him in the tough border town called
agua verde he had searched practically
everywhere

  you look een the calabozo a mexican
bartender asked

  it dawned on tombstone that the jail was
the one place he hadnt looked so he went
there the agua verde jail was a small
adobe box-like and with a heavy oak door
there was only one window in the front
a small square aperture heavily barred

  no lights were visible the one huge pad-
lock was unlocked carefully tombstone
tested the door but found it locked from the
inside somebody was inside the jail keep-
ing out of the rain

  tombstone knocked quietly with the butt
of his gun flattening himself against the
wall beside the door no doubt the builder
had been loaded with tequila because the
door opened outward

  he heard the bar being removed from in-
side and a man swung the door open step-
ping half outside as he did so tombstone
jones was a man of action-not words he
hit the man on the chin with his left fist
knocking him back into the jail then tomb-
stone removed the outside padlock threw it
into the room and came in

  the jailer was sleeping peacefully com-
pletely out from tombstones blow on a
rough table was an old oil lamp dimly light-
ing the interior there was one cell and two
prisoners one of whom was speedy smith
he peered through the bars at tombstone
the other man was big fat and disheveled

what kept yuh so long asked speedy

  i made the mistake of lookin for you in
other places replied tombstone

august  

  the key to this apartment is on the
table said speedy

 tombstone unlocked the cell and both
men came out

  mister jones meet mr atlas speedy
said

  sudbury corrected the fat man phila-
delphia

  sudbury philadelphia eh said tomb-
stone never heard of it

  sudbury is my name sir

  you told me it was atlas said speedy
make up yore mind

  i am clement p sudbury my name is
not atlas if you please i told you i am
one of the owners of the atlas cattle com-
pany

  howd they happen to jail you speedy
asked tombstone

  disturbin the peace i reckon i found
a tarantaler in my bowl of chili and me and
the cook had a argument he cant under-
stand english and i cant hablar much meji-
cano so it ended up with me chokin his
mouth open and makin him swaller the bug
he shore understood that kind of stuff-and
here i was

  what happened to you mr clement
sudbury sir atlas p-oh it doesnt
matter it was a personal matter they
held me here waiting the consummation of
a-er-business deal ive been here since
last night what a way to conduct business
i resent such methods i tell you

  the guard was recovering from the knock-
out he had no gun they sat him up in a
chair but he got nasty so they locked him
in the cell

  how about pickin up the rollin stock
and headin north tombstone said if we
stay here-maybe itll be for keeps you
dont mind bein saved do yuh mr atlas
the name is-oh well it doesnt matter
do you know my son he is clement p
sudbury the second

 who does he tend bar for asked
speedy

 tend bar my son a sudbury tend-
ing bar ridiculous why do you ask me
that

  well we know quite a few said speedy
soberly

  i may as well tell you sudbury said
wearily my son is heir to my whole estate
millions-the young fool and he fell in
love with lilita pretty but hardly the type
i would pick for his wife infatuated the
young fool i came down here to buy her

uu
off she doesnt love him-she loves his
money

  they wanted thousand dollars she
promised to go down to mexico city and
forget we negotiated for hours i had no
such money with me i gave them a check
for five thousand on the bank at arrowhead
they were to have slim de long foreman
of the atlas cattle company cash the check
for them i wrote instruction to slim they
-well i had to stay here until the deal was
consummated

  one born every thirty seconds said
speedy yore best bet is to forget the
whole deal and get out with us

  but it was a legitimate deal sir i felt
that it was cheap

  tombstone shook his head sadly maybe
youd be better off if we took yore check-
book and locked yuh in the cell again he
said at least yore heir would profit no

i reckon you better go back with us if we
can get back and-

  too late whispered speedy some-
body is among us

  somebody knocked sharply on the door
tombstone gun in hand flung it open and
a man stumbled in he was swathed in a
slicker a big mexican sombrero atop his
head speedy yanked the door shut behind
him the mexican blinked at the tableau
trying to figure out just what had happened

  this here specter looks a heap like miguel
ortega speedy said keep yore hands
right where they are my friend

  you completed the deal asked sudbury
anxiously

  ortega broke into a torrent of spanish
which none of them understood tombstone
lifted the big upturned brim of the sombrero
off ortegas head and poured a pint of water
on the floor

  in english-what happened asked
speedy

  those peeg snorted ortega he ees
not got so much money on the bank

  just a moment snapped sudbury that
is not true i have at least ten thousand
dollars on deposit in that bank

  ortega shrugged his heavy shoulders and
spread his hands

  wat can i say he asked appealingly

i weel show you-

  his right hand went into his slicker pocket
and came out with a six-shooter it might
have worked with credulous folks but
tombstone and speedy were range-wise
tombstone smashed ortega on the chin with

amazing developments bandit bust-
ers of war dance packs plenty of

rip-roaring humdinger

 also in the next issue of exciting
western will be the steel trail
an engrossing novelet by nels leroy jorgen-
sen in which cimarron kirby cattleman
finds he has his hands full when he battles
forces that are trying to destroy the rail-
road

  things start happening when kirby barges
into a fight at the place where the building 
of a spur line has stopped kirby finds that
two men are facing five or six a big bearded
man tip garrity orders him away but
kirby doesnt go he talks to a blond man
who has been defying garritys bunch

 my name is hume-dale hume the
blond man says and im chief surveyor
and acting engineer for this rail line the
man on the ground there is-was-my helper
frank thats all i know about him my
linesman these hombres here-they dont
like the notion of a rail spur cornin in re-
saca

of the controversy-and comes out with fly-
ing colors in the steel trail a grand
novelet of frontier days

and tell us which stories and which
authors you liked best in this and other is-
sues of exciting western through
knowing your likes and dislikes we are
better able to give you just the type of yarns
you enjoy most

   here are excerpts from just a few of the
 letters we have recently received

  here is my opinion of exciting western-
 it is a swell book the tombstone and speedy
 stories are swell yarns i like alamo paige and
 navajo tom raine also and the short stories are
 good-merle betzner concordia kansas

   i just got a recent issue of exciting west-
 ern and i like it very much especially tombstone
 and speedy i also like greenhorn owl-
 hooter-delbert ponder hollanburg ohio

   lust a few lines to tell you to keep up the good
 work i think that w c tuttles stories particular-
 ly those of tombstone and speedy are the best
 stories in any western magazines-louise keller
 ml sterling kentucky

   ive always hesitated to write a short story be-
 cause i figured they had to have a plot to be inter-
 esting by mistake i just read badmev are
 plumb foolish in your exciting west-
 ern if my school-girl daughter couldnt write
 a better story i would tell her to give up-george
 ireland lincoln n ebraska

   just finished reading the may issue of excit-
 ing western i thought all the stories were
 swell i particularly like ghost of the tum-
 bling k indian slap badmen ake plumb
 foolish and wind river heller-jerry
