  pears soap

   which both protects and beautifies the composition of this favorite
   beauty soap of six generations is of such an exquisite emollient character
   that it promotes the full natural action of the pores and imparts to the
   skin-surface the refined pink and white of a perfect complexion

           pears takes up little room but it is good company-to have it ready for use any-
    where and at any time is in the highest degree comforting with pears the skin is safe
    without it the traveler is at the mercy of whatever soap he can get and as many soaps
    are injurious to the skin and ruinous to the complexion it behooves everyone to be
    safeguarded with pears if any other soap is furnished you-send out and get pears

      the most economical as well as the best

                    all rights secured

        of all scented soaps pears otto of rose is the best

in the trail of the first
western tracks

by r m  west

when the first rails were iail across the vast territory west of the mis-
sissippi river little towns sprang up from place to place during a night

      the pioneers who trudged in the path of the iron trail hoped that each
rugged settlement might grow to a thriving metropolis but so soon as a  new
city  was established it was generally beset by a horde of outlaws-lawless
desperadoes who cared no more for human life than for property-whose sole
pastime was  taking a town as mr west states the saying was changed
from  a word and a blow  to  an oath and a shot the story he tells here
is based on fact and gives an adequate idea of the way in which the end-of-
the-track settlements were at the mercy of bloodthirsty desperadoes

cheap john v c didnt resemble a gun fighter in size or temper-
ament but he managed to clean up his
town all right

was changed to an oath and a shot
there seemed to be no law either civil or
military which would reach those blood-
thirsty ruthless desperadoes

  i was in julesburg colorado territory
in the late sixties on provost duty near
fort sedgwick one day when walking
along the sidewalk i heard a shot look-
ing behind me i saw a man dead in the
middle of the street while ten feet away
from the corpse stood another man i knew
well jack hayes calmly blowing the smoke
from his six-shooter hayes had been a
 rr	s

he days of the building of the
railroads across the plains
 were the days of trouble and
sudden death the bad man
was in his glory but at no
other time did the professional
killer hold such undisputed sway as in the
few years of the laying of the rails between
platte city nebraska and butte city
montana

  men were shot down for the slightest
reason and sometimes for no reason at all
the old saying a word and a blow


the railroad mans magazine

mule whacker at the fort he had been
on many a hard indian chase with my old
troop m in which i was a cavalryman

  he was considered a good fellow and
was a brave man in danger when he left
the fort and the employ of uncle sam his
name was before the quartermaster for pro-
motion to wagon-master

  but hayes had been going to the bad
now he had killed a man

  just after the shot was fired the town
marshal appeared and made a pretense of
arresting the murderer however he lacked
nerve and only managed to coax hayes to
go with him to the justice of the peace i
thought i would like to see how the law
would deal with his case and incident-
ally i wanted to be sure than an ex-caval-
ryman got a square deal so i also went
down to the office of the justice

  his honor was an ex-clerk from the
quartermasters department at the fort and
had accepted the office of justice against
the advice of his friends he accepted it
no doubt because he thought he would be
somebody in the new country and that he
might write back to  the states  on good-
looking letter paper he was a quiet gen-
tleman with a great respect for the majesty
of the law

  as i entered he was seated at a desk on
a small platform the prisoner with a
pair of six-shooters still on his hips stood
talking to the marshal

  the judge ordered hayes to step up
closer after hearing the evidence of a
man who had seen the shooting he asked
hayes what he had to say about the affair

  hayes told of a dispute and a threat made
by the dead man

   so i shot him he wound up

  the judge mused a while and rendered
the following decision

   i will turn the prisoner over to the
county court and as the charge is murder

i will set no bail marshal you keep him
safe until the train goes south then take
him to platte city and put him in the keep-
ing of the sheriff-

their regard for law

  this was all he had time to say when
out came hayess six-shooters and down
popped the judge behind his desk hayes
backed out of the court-room walked up the
street mounted his mule and rode out of
town unmolested

   his honor was ridiculed and everybody
 guyed the marshal

   so jack hayes once a peaceful mule
 whacker had become a terror to the bravest
 of marshals in the railroad towns for six
 months he ran a rig wherein he killed
 many men and one woman-yet he was
 never arrested

   but there was a force coming to the
 front which was destined to put a stop to
 the killers as they were called this was
 a little pale-faced consumptive-looking
 man known as cheap john his right
 name was smith when he first made his
 appearance along the line of the union
 pacific railroad he pushed a hand-cart
 loaded with shirts socks suspenders and
 other necessities of frontier haberdasher-

   this insignificant little pedler was the
 last man in the world who would be picked
 out to regulate the doings of the western
 desperado but he was such a man in time
 his name became a nightmare to evil-doers
 when cheyenne wyoming was only a
 city of tents cheap john set up in the
 clothing business in a  ten-by-thirty 
 frame covered with canvas

a huge  joke

   the story goes that he was such a
 cringing helpless little fellow that outlaws
 and even drunken loafers would swagger
 into his place cuff him around his own
 store help themselves to his goods and
 walk out without paying this was enough
 to break the heart of any man in those
 days every man carried the law in his
 own holster and the weak went to their
 death without a murmur cheap john
 stood the cuffing and bullying until one
 day three whisky-soaked cowboys entered
 and began their old game

   one of them after rubbing the skin off
 the end of cheap johns nose with the muz-
 zle of his six-shooter laid the cocked weap-
 on on the counter snaked the begging
 little merchant by the hair to the back of
 his store then kicked him back again and
 under the counter

   while the three cowboys were roaring
 at the huge joke cheap john popped up
 on the other side of the counter grabbed
 the six-shooter of the nearest man and in
 three seconds and three shots killed all
 three men

   after that cheap john was another man
 he became a power in the wilderness like
in the trail of the first western tracks



a tiger raised in a cage he had killed his
masters tasted human blood and was a
slave no longer it quickly became known
that the quickest and surest way to commit
suicide was to kick cheap john

  he not only ran his own store like clock-
work and his trade increased amazingly
but he started out to clean up the town

  however cheap john did not degenerate
into a desperado as so many others had
done he induced other business men to
join him they organized a quick-acting

  keefe would not have been a bad sort
of a fellow if he had left bad company
and whisky alone and gone to work
 shorty  was hopelessly depraved-an out-
and-out river tough from the slums of kan-
sas city

  this trio thought nothing of going into
any new place and  taking the town as
they called it just for fun it gave them
a proper standing

  they would ride or walk up the middle
of the main street shooting at everything

down popped the judge behind
his desk

smooth-working vigilance committee with
cheap john as its mainspring

  this vigilance committee started to break
up the gangs of gamblers dance-hall mas-
ters horse thieves and desperadoes who
followed the laying of the rails and turned
the end-of-the-track towns into hovels where
men shot for the fun of seem em kick

the worst  gang

  one of the most desperate and heartless
of these gangs was made up of jack hayes
now utterly reckless in regard to human
life jack keefe and a man known only
as short

and everybody in sight laughing and yell-
ing wildly while the entire town suddenly
suspended business and got under cover

  i do not believe that they always shot
to kill but enough killing was done to
make their names bywords for terror from
platte city to the promontory

  some towns however maintained a mar-
shal with saint vitus dance in his trigger-
fingers at a salary of five hundred dol-
lars a month for it was a ticklish job

  kit carson new mexico was such a
town when tom thomson was holding
it down those man tigers took good care to
keep away or else they were very lamb-
like whenever they paid it a visit


the railroad mans magazine

  one day hayes keefe and shorty
went to cheyenne they opened up in
their regular style and ran afoul of cheap
john they promptly got a notice from
the vigilance committee to leave town in-
side of two hours or get strung up they
treated the notice as a joke

before the guns

  shortly after sundown the vigilance
committee got after them and only for the
timely interference of the united states
district attorney j p bartlett who was
later judge bartlett of manchester new
hampshire their trail would have ended
then and there judge bartletts influence
was supreme over all at that time and
many a foolish young fellow had good cause
to thank him for being saved from death at
the end of a rope though usually richly
deserved

  i say  foolish for many a young man
who meant well while under the influence
of whisky traveled the streets with the des-
peradoes thinking they were doing some-
thing wonderful to be seen with them

  when the men with a rope got after them
however they were only too glad to pray
to the much respected district attorney to
save them

  as the three killers suddenly looked into
the guns of the v c they thought it high
time to also beg to be brought before judge
bartlett cheap john wishing to give
even man a fair show sent for mr bart-
lett he walked down the line of men
wearing black masks and demanded the
prisoners it took some nerve for one man
to do this for when the vigilance commit-
tee got after any one it meant business
but the v c had confidence in bartlett so
the prisoners were surrendered

the three cool off

  bartlett took the three men into his
office he and his deputy disarmed them
and put them under bonds to appear 
monday morning at ten for trial he told
them that it would be better for them not
to give bonds but to remain prisoners but
they put up their money got their freedom
-but not their weapons-and walked out

  it was not long however before they
managed to get hold of a gun or two and
were on the war-path again

all this time cheap john had his eye

on them and when he did not his scouts
did and as the three kllers began to warm
up they got into some kind of a shooting
scrape in a place called the dewdrop inn
cleaned it out and left

  when crossing the street to the keystone
dance hall a friend of theirs overtook
them this man had just run into twenty
of the vigilance committee who were
marching up a side street two by two
masked armed carrying three ropes with
cheap john at their head this man had
dogged the v c to give notice to the gang

  hayes keefe and  shorty  cooled off
at once and became so thoroughly alarmed
at the evident determination of the commit-
tee to hang them that they cut down the
street on a run and left town

  they had not time to get their horses so
went afoot this was a hardship as well
as a disgrace to a desperado but they com-
forted themselves with the reflection that
they could steal other horses just as good
even if they did have to waste a cartridge
or two in killing the rightful owner

at dave mullers

  they struggled on through the rain and
mud until two in the morning when they
arrived wet muddy tired and ugly at the
door of dave mullers ranch on dale creek

  they awoke him and he let them in
soon they were stretched out on the floor

  cheap john took ten of his best men and
started after them on horseback taking
the wrong trail he missed them but for-
tunately arrived at dale creek ahead of
them he did not expect to find them
there

  learning from a night herder who was
holding a bunch of cattle near mullers
until daylight that three men had just been
rapping on mullers door the v c swung
into the saddle and rode over to mullers

  without arousing anybody cheap john
looked through the window and saw the
men he was after concluding to wait un-
til they were asleep before making the at-
tack he left a guard and rode back to the
cow camp

  there he hired a heavy wagon and four
mules driving it quietly over the muddy
road back to the sleeping ranch-house he
unhitched the mules and by hand wheeled
the wagon up to within fifty feet of the
door-the stiff heavy tongue ready to use
as a battering-ram
in the trail of the first western tracks	

    two men held the tongue to guide it in
  case one should be shot down while four
  more got behind the wagou to shove then
  the six with their battering-ram awaited
  cheap johns further orders

    the rain had stopped falling and the
  moon was shining brightly inside the
  three men and muller were snoring the
  vigilance committee was now ready to begin
  work

the rude awakening

    taking four men with him cheap john
  walked to the door and rapped muller
  growled whos there now

     a friend answered cheap john
well get out friend im not a goin
to get up again till mornin 

    john repeated the request and knocked
  again this time with his six-shooter

    no use i tell you friend said mul-
ler pull your freight if you hit that
door again ill send a bullet through it
so clear out 

    john changed his tactics and demanded
  that the door be opened or that he would
  batter it down and do a little shooting on
  jiis own hook

he then heard another voice speaking to

midler in a moment jack hayes asked
who are you and what do you want
open the door and youll find out
returned john keeping to one side to avoid
a possible bullet

  cheap john heard hayes say to muller
i know that voice theyre after us
waiting no longer cheap john gave the
signal and rattley-bang the wagon-tongue
crashed through the door and the eleven
members of the committee piled into the
room with cocked revolvers right on top of
the doomed killers

  had these desperadoes the weapons that
judge bartlett had taken from them the
vigilance men would have had a contract
on their hands as it was the arrested
men could put up only a punch-and-kick
fight and even at this they made it hot for
a few seconds

roped on the wagon

  without any extra words however
cheap john and his men soon had them
roped except being kept under guard
muller was not molested-it was none of
his funeral

  the men were taken outside and loaded
onto the wagon they were roped and

snaked the begging little mer-
chant by the hair to the

back of his store


the railroad mans magazine

made to stand in the wagon-box surround-
ed by the muzzles of six-shooters the
desperadoes faces in the flaring light be-
tween breaking day and dying moonlight
looked ghastly white they looked the
dead men they were

  while the mules were being hitched to
the wagon hayes asked

  why have you followed us way out

we are sick of it we are going to clean
up your kind of men if we have to hang
you all

    instead of going- about your business
when released by the district attorney you
went right at your old tricks you also
made your brag that you would kill me and
every man that composed my party and
you did not leave town until you heard for
the second time that we were out on the
street again you had your opportunity and
lost it now you must take your medicine

all now being ready the vigilance men
mounted their horses and the driver was
told to drive down to a big cottonwood-tree
standing on the bank of the creek about
half a mile below arriving under this
tree the men tossed ropes over its limbs and
drew the slipped nooses snug
around the desperadoes necks

  then cheap john said
 there is a man in my party
who says he is acquainted with
an old lady living in st louis
he says she is a widow with a
daughter and one son he says
this son was good to his mother
and sister except when drink-
ing jack keefe are you that
son   

   i guess i am muttered
keefe

  john turned aside and held
a whispered consultation with
the man who knew keefes
family he then asked keefe
for details to prove his iden-
tity keefe gave the street
number of his mothers home
her description and other mat-
ters all of which was said to
be correct

   keefe said cheap john
how long will it take you to
get to st louis if i let you go
i think that if you did not get
into bad company you would
not be so bad a man-

    i can ride as fast as the
trains can run and ill take
the first one out of the country said keefe
eagerly

  you promise me said cheap john
that if i release you you will at once get
out of the territory and never come back

   yes i will said keefe

    men take off the rope and let him come
down here to me ordered cheap john  i

they arrived wet muddy tired
and ugly at the door of
dave mullers ranch

here didnt we leave town like you said
youve no business to come after us like
this

   enough of that ordered cheap john
now keep still youll be given a chance
to talk when the time comes but ill tell
you this right now you three men have
been running things tt suit yourselves and
r

in the trail of the first western tracks



will keep you under guard keefe until i
see you on board the train

  as the men started to take the rope from
his neck keefe interrupted 

   hold on there how about my pards 
are they not goin with me  

   no said john  those other two men -
will never leave that tree except as dead
men i certainly shall not turn them loose
again to rob and kill theyve murdered
enough innocent men

   it would be a matter of only a short
time at the best before they are hung by
somebody and it had better be right now
before they have a chance to do any more
murder no jack you are better off with-
out their company if i turned you and
them loose together you would be back in
cheyenne before night ready for trouble
all this time hayes and  shorty  were
not silent instead of making a plea for
their lives they spent the time cursing cheap
john and what they called his gang of
cutthroats

  come come said john bring keefe
here and let us get his over

    all right  snarled keefe  if you wont
let my pards go with me-i dont go so
drive on your cart-you pack of murder-
ing bloodhounds

  struck dumb with amazement the men

 looked at each other and at keefe they
 were astounded that a man could so reck-
 lessly throw away his life hayes was the
 first to speak

    call the murdering little dogs bluff
keefe and go then come back and kill him
and all these cutthroats to revenge-

   before keefe could change his mind
 cheap john gave the signal and the driver
 brought his big blacksnake along the hips of
 his swing mules the wagon jerked from
 under the three reckless unfortunate men
 and their bodies were left swinging between
 heaven and earth

   leaving them swinging as they were the
 vigilance committee rode away

   thus died three young men who in one
 short year had changed from good steady-
 working men obedient to the law and the
 right of their fellow beings into desperate
 murderers

   the frontier railroad cattle and mining
 towns suffered long from such men but
 when their end did come it was almost
 always a case of them being  shot or hung
 cheap john and his vigilance committee
 cantered back to cheyenne unsaddled and
 quietly went about their business the
 whole town applauded and thanked them
 and it was some time before their services
 were again needed

the last station

just before running into the great terminal the brakeman galled the

stations of his old run

rhe railroad mans magazine is
indebted to one of its readers mr r
alexander of oregon for the story and poem
which follow it is an old story and a trueone
ivc had long looked for a copy and are particularly
glad of this opportunity to present this bygone
but extremely human incident to our readers
 the last station appeared in the detroit
free press some time in  it awoke the
poetic muse in miss susie drury who cleverly
recorded the little story in verse which she named
 the dying brakeman

the last station

he had been sick at one of the hotels for
three or four weeks and the boys on the
road had dropped in daily to see how he got along
and to learn if thby could render him any kind-
ness the brakeman was a good fellow and one
and all encouragcd him in the hope that he would
pull through the doctor didnt regard the case

as dangerous but the other day the patient began
sinking and it was seen that he could not live
the night out a dozen of his friends sat in the
room when night came but his mind wandered
and he did not recognize them

  it was near one of the depots and after the
great trucks and noisy drays had ceased rolling
by the bells and the short sharp whistles of the
yard-engines sounded painfully loud the patient
had been very quiet for half an hour when he
suddenly unclosed his eyes and shouted

   ival-a-ma-zoo 

  one of the men brushed the hair back from
the cold forehead and the brakeman closed his
eyes and was quiet for a time then the wind
whirled around the depot and banged the blinds
on the window of his room and he lifted his
hand and cried out

  the men understood the brakeman thought

lie was coming east on the michigan central
the effort seemed to have greatly exhausted him
for he lay like one dead for the next five minutes
and a watcher felt for his pulse to see if life had
not gone out a tug going down the river sounded
her whistle and the dying brakeman opened his
eyes and called out  ann arbor 

  he had been over the road a thousand times
but he had made his last trip death was draw-
ing a special train over the old track and he was
brakeman engineer and conductor

  one of the yard-engines uttered a shrill whistle
of warning as if the glare of the headlight had
shown to the engineer some stranger in peril and
the brakeman called out

   yp-slanty-change cars for eel river road 
  hes coming in fast said one of the men

   and the end of his  run  will be the end of
his life  said a second

  the dampness of death began to collect on the
patients forehead and there was that ghastly look
on the face which death always brings the
slamming of a door down the hall startled him
again and he moved his head and faintly called
grand trunk junction-passengers going east
by the grand trunk change cars

he was so quiet after that that all the men
gathered around the bed believing that he was
dead his eyes closed and the brakeman lifted
his hand moved his head and whispered  de-
not  detroit but death 

  he died with the half-uttered whisper on his
lips and the headlight on deaths engine shone
full in his face and covered it with such pallor
as naught but death can bring

misses the locomotive

      henever i get out of a train at the
grand central or the new pennsylvania
station i cant help missing the old locomotive
said a traveller  ever since i was a child one
of the pleasures of a railroad journey was to look
over the locomotive which had been pulling my
train but somehow i dont get this pleasure out
of the electric motor

   the trouble with the motor seems to be that
its too businesslike it is plain and prosaic be-
side the old locomotive why you cant even see
the driving-wheels and might as well be looking
at a huge soap-box for all the interesting parts
you can see

   from habit i suppose i always look to see
whats been pulling me when i finish a railroad
ride but when i see one of these motors at the
pennsylvania station i sigh for the old locomo-
tive it has displaced the motor doesnt make a
sound after it gets in just as though it had been
no exertion at all to pull you under the river
but how different the locomotive you always
find it panting away like some living being get-
ting its breath as it were then theres the en-
gineer leaning out of his cab window watching
the travellers leave his train the vitalizer of the
whole thing you dont feel so drawn to the
motorman somehow-new york sim
with a small d

by robert fulkerson hoffman

it is easy to have your opinion but
real knowledge is both dear and difficult

ticular theres a lot more of it in the
mild and pensive style of the closet philoso-
pher who framed up the last report of the
world to world committees board for the
flaying of railroad men who are too
dead to talk back

   main idea continued damon tossing
the pamphlet aside and limping around the
end of his desk to a seat beside moffat at
the window seems to be wiping out the
personal equation eh and scorching a
big  d  for  discipline  in the railroad
hide same as folks out in the big country
brand a wild-eyed steer-so deep and gall-
ing that it cant be lost to sight

  then damon sat down and  expanded 
while he finished the noon hour with his
friend from the floor below it was a
silent sort of expansion for a time while his
keen blue eyes looked out unseeingly from
under his thatch of white hair and whiter
shaggy brows the dry powdery snow-
swirled in little eddies upon the sill of the
lofty window in the railway exchange
building and the screeching northwest wind
whipped trailing banners of white from the
stone coping of the illinois central depres-
sion far below

  the troubled waters of the turbulent and
deserted lake were dimly veiled in shifting
driving wraiths of summer sails while da-
mons calm blue eyes asked nothing of them



              the whole there appears a de-
cided advance in the applied
science of both automatic
and manually controlled sig-
naling but there still remains
a preponderant element of
the personal equation in american rail-
roading a lamentable lack of discipline
among the men-trainmen in particular-
which the board feels impelled to deplore
discipline discipline and again discipline
should be the watchword until the last ele-
ment of individual negligence shall be
eliminated beyond the possibility of em-
bodying a daily menace to the traveling
public there is of course the verisimili-
tude of safety even while- 

   damon verisi-five-pairs-and-a-trailing-
truck is good not to say rich and exuber-
ant interrupted the deeply contented voice
of moffat the freight-rate clerk  but what
kind of gas exactly are you inhaling
come out of your corner expand eluci-
date  

  damon did not at once appear instead
his voice welled up again dispassionately
over a roll-top behind which he sat in
leisurely seclusion

   that said he  is the double-distilled
quintessence of gab as she is sometimes
written into the short and simple annals of
the poor railroad man- trainmen in par-


the railroad mans magazine

but seemed searching back upon the long
trail to where his fellows of old were still
battling actively with the mountains of the
high southwest

  a specially heavy roll of waters swelled
and leaped under the lash of the wnnd in
the inner harbor raced outward to its swift
and sonorous collision with the ice-capped
breakwater and spouting its whitened
spume a hundred feet in air broke tum-
bling into the wilder waters of the open
lake

  the distant impact cleared the veil from
damons eyes and brought him back to the
sheltered comfort of his desk and its sur-
roundings where for many many months
he had been the able and final arbiter in
matters of record and discipline which
gained sufficient weight upon the line to
bring them of their own inertia to the gen-
eral offices for adjustment

  from this it will appear that damon if
he would speak had in his favor the pre-
sumption of a true knowledge of the per-
sonal element in railroading he spoke

   one winter day- noctidial day i pre-
sume our friend of the pamphlet would say
because there was really a day and a night
involved-one winter day there was a sort
of three-cornered affair finished up out in
the mountains in a way that ought to sat-
isfy the most fastidious dresser-up of other
peoples behavior that the personal equa-
tion as they call it is on the railroad job
with both feet and there to stay just as it
is everywhere else only more so

   ought to satisfy em-if they saw the
whole play-that personal equation is a
kind of free horse in railroading nearly
ridden to death but not needing the big
 d  burned into it with a marking-brush
dipped in vitriol to make the horse stay
on the job

   its the surest big thing that the dear
unsuspecting public has to hitch fast to
charge the whole statistical load to the rail-
road man which would be far from fair
and he kills one passenger out of twenty-
four hundred thousand carried in the course
of a year while he gives up one out of
every four hundred and twenty-two of him-
self dead in following out his ideas of a
discipline more self-exacting than he would
allow anybody else to apply to him

  the semaphore until it needs fixing
automatically keeps one eye on the job
he keeps one eye on the semaphore and
the other eye-and both ears-on the rest

of the job every big play that comes up
grows out of a hundred others and when
its done it stands out just as plain and
simple as the little snag that barefoot john-
nie stubs his toe upon but after its done
not before

  thats the way with this thing that
come up out on the mountain the motive-
power folks ordered some new locomotives
to cover the runs of california express no
 east no  west over the mountain divi-
sion when the first new engine went into
the harness she showed on her first trip
that somebody had made a slight miscue
something wrong with her breathing ap-
paratus

   she got over the mountain without a
helper as they intended but she hadnt
showed up enough reserve power to make it
a safe daily performance she just dragged
no  over the pass on bare schedule and
nothing to spare

   headquarters sent a pair of mechanical
experts out to test her with some little in-
strument  dinguses and maybe change her
valves according to whats found

  nadir-the eastern end of the division
doing its big and honest best down on the
banks of the crooked claw had a master
mechanic who had got there by a long and
hard road of personal experience his
pride of this attainment got to the surface
of him in an overlarge diamond shirt-stud
and a tendency to rest his feet in the middle
of his desk while giving audience to any-
body or anything less than what he called
a  brass collar when the  brass collars 
were known to be at a safe distance

  further he never whispered when tell-
ing what he could do to an engine-and he
didnt like experts he had ideas of his
own as to what no ls engine needed before
he had finished looking over the despatch-
ed shoulder while her first run was being
penciled in he remembered a mason en-
gine that way back in - do you see
moffat

  zenith western end of the division
over on the other side of the mountain had
a master mechanic who had come by the
same hard road of experience but was not
so anxious to prove it by oratory and by
the outward glittering insignia of office as
he was to quietly make good with results
but-he didnt like experts

  he had ideas of his own touching the
needs of no ls engine before she had
bombarded her way out of his hearing on
with a small  d



her first trip toward the nadir end he
remembered a blood engine way back in-
well he wanted to get at the new engine
before the nadir man got a crack at her
and he couldnt rest easy for fear the other
fellow would get her first

  the engineer on no  freely offered
to bet his buckskin gauntlets that he could
set them valves himself and make her climb
a semaphore mast he begged for a chance
to do it he ran a grant engine once
that-

  well of course the experts had some
instructions and some ideas of their own
first of which was to try her out carefully
for a full round trip as she was delivered
then make required changes they too
remembered some engines but their only
sure play was to hold all of the others off
both ends and the middle and make good
on their own account when it came time to
answer to headquarters

  seems all right and natural so far
dont it moffat

  sure said moffat little lack of
discipline maybe but-

   maybe admitted damon  but youll
notice later that what discipline  loses in
the shuffle  it generally  makes up in the
deal

   the new engine made her first trip on
a saturday with the experts aboard pulling
no  from zenith over the pass and down
to nadir the master mechanics listened
at both ends of the wire and the experts
worked their instruments out on the cylin-
der while the engineer drove her through
and listened to the exhaust

  now moffat there are as many reasons
why a set of locomotive valves should be set
this way or that as there are reasons why
vou should charge one dollar for hauling

j	o	o

a ton of freight to jericho and charge only
seventy-five cents for hauling it to joppa
well say which is a whole lot farther
away and-

  oh i can easily make that clear to
you bristled moffat promptly assuming
an upright position in his chair  the-
 yes i know interrupted damon
same as i might give you some of their
blind-lead and cut-off jargon but-lets
dont

   itll do to say that the engine was a
little lame on that run and the engineer
urged the need of shortening up an eccen-
tric blade when they got to nadir toward
evening he smiled in a queer sort of way

when he urged it but he was a good fellow
and the experts consented to have that rou-
tine change made to please him

   the engine was laid up over night
and held on order to haul no  back over
the same route the following day late in
the night of the lay-over one of the experts
took the precaution of looking into the
roundhouse where the engine stood

  lights were flaring and smoking the
ground floor was littered with valve-motion
parts and the underworks of the engine
looked as if she had just dragged her way
clear of a modest kind of wreck

   the master mechanic at nadir had got
to her first his men were fixing her  like
that mason engine it was to have been
a grand coup on the experts the man at
zenith and on everybody outside of nadir

   that you see is what it was to be after
the experts had made another run without
knowing of the changed valve-gear and
found her to be the best thing on the pike
and said so why of course theyd have
to say so

   the expert looked smiled sighed and
stole sadly away to bed the thing was
too far done to admit of stopping it then
and there was no other engine available
for no 

  when he appeared at the roundhouse
next day the comparative stillness of sun-
day hung over the place the new engine
stood purring quite circumspectly upon her
pit there was nothing in sight to pro-
claim the activities feverishly past with the
night

   everything had been done except the
one thing imperatively needful done in a
hurry of hurries it is true and with the
result more than doubtful but the one
thing that should have been done without
failure the emptying of the boiled-down
alkali water from her accumulation of the
previous day and the filling of her boiler
with clean water had been entirely lost
sight of in the rushing valve-work

  the expert mounted his instruments in
the wind-shelter built up on the right-hand
cylinder and stationed his companion in
the cab with the engineer

   it was early winter that sunday morn-
ing and the sun was smiling in a kind of
ironical way-something like the smile that
flitted around the mouth of the engineer
as he puttered about-and way off toward
the mountain head half-way to zenith
there was a threatening canopy that panned


the railroad mans magazine

out some hearty winter lightning later in
the day

  they went over to the station and
hooked on to no  all in good time and
left nadir on the dot it was a scandalous
run right from the start that historic
mason engine must have been of another
breed than no ls engine she was evi-
dently in distress in more ways than one
she was lame-oh lame-and the foam-
ing alkali water in her began priming at
the first hard pull

    she lost on the up-grades and ran hard
for it down hill choking something near to
whitewash out of her cylinders and streak-
ing it down her stack while the expert took
some worthless indications from the instru-
ment the engineer his smile burned out
in the red flush of anxiety fought her up
to a losing battle with the hard schedule

    the experts gave it up at the first water-
stop and went back into the train in dis-
gust that passed them out of what came
later

   there was enough of assisting grade to
get them to the foot of the twenty-five-mile
climb through the pass on time they
started up the pass without a helper they
got to the half-way station the last point
where they could have run in for no  a
little shy but a lot mad and hoping some

  no  east-bound and of the same class
had the right of track and would wait at
the mountain top only what the schedule
called for on their regular meet there un-
less the block was red against her

   ordinarily shed come squirming down
out of the turnings of the pass taking all
the advantage she dared on the one-hun-
dred-and-fifty-foot grades but sure to shoot
across the occasional flats in rocket style

   there was just a greasy little film of
feather-snow that had come down with the
lightning display of the late afternoon
under that was a weeks gathering of crust-
ed snow between the rails it had smoothed
and thawed under the sun and the passing
ash-pans by day and had frozen by night
until it would bear a mans weight in some
places in others it wouldnt

    the feather-snow laid the engines last
straw upon her by starting her on a steady
sneaking slip that never got big enough to
be plainly heard in the exhaust about a
mile from the meeting-point at the top of
the mountain with the steepest grade and
three sharp folds of the curving track yet
to be climbed they were so close on no

s time that they knew they had to flag
ahead for it

   the engine had been dragged down to
a plodding gait of not more than eight
miles an hour she still had a chance but
it was the one chance of keeping her stead-
ily going on sand the flagman ran out
over the foot-board and jumped from the
pilot-deck to the ditch

   he scrambled up out of the snow and
forced his way ahead to a point where he
could safely get to the middle of the track
and run upon the snow-crust

   the quick darkness of the pass was
coming down it was just in those few min-
utes when it is neither night nor day there
so he carried both flag and red lamp

   that flagman knew just what kind of
a job he had drawn he had sufficient
imagination to picture no  making her
last pull dead sure and easy up the other
side of the crest with her helper-engine
coupled on ahead

    the thought of her load of people sit-
ting there all unaware the panting engine
pursuing him from the rear with its load
of other people likewise trustful and un-
aware urged him to a speed that burned
his lungs with the keen mountain air and
sent his blood pounding to his ears in great
throbs until they ached almost to bursting

    the treacherous snow-crust broke again
and again first under one foot and then the
other he rose from his falls glanced at
his red lamp and ran doggedly on

    he ran out upon the rounded slippery
ties of high bridge in the last curve which
hid him from the engine following and from
the crest above

  too eager exhausted what you will
he blundered and fell between the ties on
high bridge he had a confused moment
of dancing red lights while he clutched at
the icy ties then he fell through and deep
among the cross-timbers with the plodding
exhaust from no ls engine creeping closer
above him and the sharp bark of the helper
cutting loose from no  rolling down from
the mountain around the point of rocks

  then a stinging shock of pain ran
through him and the darkness shut down
upon him completely his red lamp and
his flag were buried in the snow deep down
below where he hung among the timbers
no ls engine rolled slowly past above
him no  hung poised for her flight from
above between them stood the spur of
rocks the way for both seemed clear
with a small d



  the block-signal moffat youre all
right-for a freight-rate man

   yes it was single track and there was
a block that stood to hold no  and any-
thing else east-bound if the red gauze disk
showed in the bulls-eye

   it was a short block of two thousand
feet from the lower end of the passing
tracks it was there to guard that last hard
and crooked climb against exactly the kind
of thing which was about to happen to
make it doubly sure no  sent its flagman
ahead into the block and came dragging in
after him close on no s time he fell
out of the game as ive shown you

  jim bayard and sunny acre on the en-
gine of no  looked ahead down the grade
after the helper engine was in to clear
both of them sized up the semaphore care-
fully while they pumped up the air and
made the brake test

    shes white jim  announced sunny
the fireman	-

  white responded bayard with a
final look at the disk

   he released the brakes and no  crept
forward promptly with the slow resistless
movement of a starting avalanche he
tightened the brakes for the usual drag-
test then instead of letting her out for a
freer start he tightened them down to a full
grinding stop and blew the conductors call
quick and low from the whistle

  packer came running from the train
watch in hand

    matter jim  he shouted as he ran
 why dontyou go 

    pull down that big pinch-bar from the
back of the tender sunny quick said
bayard to the fireman

  to the conductor or to both he said

    i dont like the look of things up
here i dont like the feel of it 

    what are you talking about bayard 
weve got no time here for riddles what
do you see shes white why dont
you go 

    i thought i heard something coming
against us when we first stopped said ba-
yard as he took the pinch-bar from sun-
nys hand

  do you hear it now demanded
packer fiercely why dont it show up
look at the  taard   its white aint it 
  and whats more continued bayard
as he climbed down ignoring packers vol-
ley of anxious questions  i thought i
caught a flash of red way down yonder

just as we tipped over the crest but it
dont come  he admitted while hurrying
ahead down the grade to the semaphore

  when he had passed it by a few yards
he stooped and laid the steel pinch-bar
across from rail to rail

    now what color is she  he demand-
ed of packer who had not yet passed below
the semaphore light

    white  shouted packer  white
shes dead as a glass eye flag down
sunny flag down and meet their flag
they cant hurt us but flag em in from
the point and find out whats wrong while
youre riding up with them ask them if
they were flagging against us tell em
their flag didnt get through  

  no  pushed her weaving nose around
the point of rocks before sunny had run
twenty steps packer threw the switch and
let her drag into the passing track while
bayard dug and burrowed in the snow near
the semaphore-mast

    signal wires hit by lightning  said
bayard when he rose from his knees and
looked stealthily into packers questioning
eyes  magnets fused and welded solid
while she stood to show clear board we
are first over the road since the lightning
cut loose up here this afternoon

   then they ran the helper engine down
to high bridge and searched me out from
among the bridge timbers said damon

   you  demanded moffat  out from
among the-

  yes replied damon gently rubbing
his bent but very able thigh  i may have
shown a  lamentable lack of discipline  by
falling through high bridge just at the
wrong time but i was the flagman on no 
that day and im giving you this just as it
pieced together after everybody had rubbed
noses for a week or so afterward

  if i was writing pamphlets for the
world to worlds board id probably say
that because of my  individual negligence

i	got the prettiest case of double compound
fracture of the thigh that a railroad sur-
geon ever tackled

   but beings its just among ourselves
well say that i finished that trip with a
broken leg in the tourist sleeper of no 
and let it go at that

  huh moffat emitted quite noncom-
mittally i suppose that nadir round-
house bunch and your valve-setting engineer
didnt get much done to them after the ex-
perts got in their report 


the railroad mans magazine

   they didnt replied damon not a
thing done to them the experts didnt
make any report on that part of it they
fixed the engine right and went home

    the only report that ever went in cov-
ered an engine failure account of tad wa-
ter and a semaphore gone wrong account
of hit by lightning

    moffat every one of those fellows
played up to the best that he had in him
taking the big human average every one
of us did and thats what youve got to
bank on first last and all the time

   discipline if its to get results worth
while is an elastic code big-souled enough
to hold men up to concert pitch without
stringing them so high that they break every
whipstitch and lose all pride in their work

    its got to do some hard things and do
them swift and sure but its got to stretch
enough to take in the  personal equation 
of a high average grade of humanity un-
derstand that the hardest discipline that any
railroad man worthy of the job receives and
maintains is the discipline which he ap-
plies to his own hard-tried body and soul

    and concluded damon as he limped
 slowly back to his desk there is always
 a handsome balance standing to the credit
 of the  personal equation  in this business
 -if you know where to look for it as i
 previously rose to announce to this private
 audience of one discipline with small  d
 in the hands of the non-elect manages to
 make good in the final deal whatever it may
 lose in the preliminary shuffle

   then damon subsided into a mere rus-
 tling of papers while he approved the set-
 ting of ten credit-marks in the record of
 tom gray engineer for firing his engine
 from okalee to sanchez while his fireman
 had writhed with cramps

   he looked thoughtfully for a moment at
 the door which had just closed benind mof-
 fat departing for the floor below then
 he prepared a recommendation and sent it
  to the distant master mechanic suggesting
 that the addition of five credit-marks to the
 firemans record would be approved if sent
 in as a recognition of his staying out the trip
 on the seat-box rather than beating a re-
 treat to the coaches

 the live-stock limited

          by charles frederick carter

  

                              

there is no form of freight that necessitates more attention from train-
men or suffers a greater locs of value in transit than cattle en route to
the slaughter-house fruit vegetables and all other perishable farm
products can be carried in refrigerator-cars without loss or damage but no
way has yet been discovered by which beeves sheep and hogs may be kept
from losing a certain amount of weight for every hour spent on the rails

     ever since cattle-buyers ceased driving their herds to market and began
shipping them by rail speed has been the greatest factor in the economical
transportation of live stock and it is for that reason that cattle-trains have
made some fast-freight records that are hard to beat the joy of hustling
cattle over the right-of-way and the lessons that some trainmen have been
forced to learn regarding the loading of live stock form one of the most
interesting chapters in the railroad world

running fast trains for fighting fretting four-legged passengers often
requires a large fund of patience and an ability
to think and act quickly

cas foremost citizen
might start on a journey
from anywhere to some-
where and the railroads
could send him all round
robin hoods barn by
their slowest trains they could side-track
and delay him they could refuse to put
dining or sleeping cars on his train or to
stop at dining stations they could cause
him to spend a whole week traveling five
hundred miles and the united states gov-
ernment could not say a word

  likewise the railroads could play tag
with a consignment of firecrackers for the
fourtli-of-july trade from may till au-
gust or with a consignment of christmas

goods from december until the first of
march and still the government would be
indifferent

  let a shoat or a steer start on its trav-
els however and instantly the whole ma-
chinery of this mighty government is on
the alert to see that it goes by the most
direct route in the quickest possible time
to its destination nothing is too good for
prospective sausage or porterhouse one
little runt of a brindle steer looms larger
in the eye of the government than a whole
car-load of prominent citizens with the vote
of a state in their vest-pockets

  theres no joke about it either it cost
the texas and pacific a pot of money to
find out that the statute providing that live


the railroad mans magazine

stock must be shipped by the most direct
route is good law at least the lnited
states supreme court said it was when on
may   it affirmed the right of east-
man  knox to collect  damages from
the road for violating this provision

the twenty-eight-hour law

  also a whole lot of railroads part with
a slice of their revenues every once in a
while for violating the statute which re-
quires that stock must not be kept in cars
longer than twenty-eight hours without un-
loading for food water and rest for ex-
ample judge landis fined six railroads
 at chicago may   for vio-
lation of this law in october of the same
year four roads were fined  at
leavenworth for the same offense and on
may   four roads were fined 
at st louis on the charge of violating the
twenty-eight-hour law

  such strenuous manifestations of solici-
tude on the part of the government in be-
half of four-footed travelers would be quite
enough to make everybody on the railroad
step lively whenever a shipment of live
stock looms above the horizon but there are
also additional incentives

  cattle and hogs lose rapidly in weight
or  shrink in the vernacular of the trade
during the process of shipment in addi-
tion to shrinkage every hour of close con-
finement in a car increases the danger that
fat hogs will suffocate or that peevish
steers will get the weaker ones down and
trample or gore them to death

  for these reasons the shipper is desper-
ately anxious to get his consignment on the
buyers scales in the shortest possible time
any railroad that does not stand ready to
burn holes in the atmosphere with its
stock - trains therefore can confidently
count on seeing its loathsome competitors
gather in all the profitable live-stock traffic

  for all these reasons the word stock
has the same effect on a railroad man as
the exclamation rats has on a terrier at
sound of that magic syllable he pricks
up his ears stiffens his sinews and takes
a reef in his belt instantly he is prepared
to break the speed record or perish in the
attempt particularly if the run is to be
made at a session of the smoke committee
instead of out on the road in these days
when through freights make the run be-
tween new york and chicago in sixty

hours as a regular thing you have to fan
em some to make a stock run worth talk-
ing about

  this is why the genuine blown-in-the-
bottle wonder stories of fast runs with
stock-trains date way back the average
time with a stock-train between chicago
and pittsburgh nowadays is twenty-five to
twenty-nine hours which is about as fast
as anybody cares to turn the wheels of a
stock-car but it is done so often that no-
body would dare brag about it

  one of the the rims they are still talk-
ing about was made by the lake shore and
new york central in  to get one hun-
dred and fifty-eight fancy western corn-fed
steers to new york for export the steers
which belonged to t c eastman left chi-
cago at noon friday may   in
special cars with flexible partitions which
gave each steer a compartment to himself
in which to partake of a cold collation or
lie down at pleasure this was to avoid
the necessity of unloading under the twen-
ty-eight-hour limit

  the lake shore doddered along with
these steers even going so far as to head
them in on the passing track to get out of
the way of the limited with the result that
it was well along in the forenoon of sun-
day when they reached buffalo the
steers were fearfully bored while eastman
is said to have had a fit every two hours
what he said to the new york central
folks is not recorded but it must have been
plenty for things began to happen

they made time

  an engine backed down onto those stock-
cars in the buffalo yards while a switch-
engine was putting a caboose on behind
the conductor wiggled his dexter hand at
the engineer even before the pin clinked
into place whereupon the eagle-eye pulled
her tail so hard she nearly coughed up the
grate-bars

  to get to the point those steers never
traveled less than thirty-five miles an hour
and from that up to forty-five which for
the stock-cars of thirty years ago wasnt
half bad at eleven-forty oclock sunday
night the train came to a halt in the six-
tieth street yards in new york just fifty-
eight hours and forty minutes after leaving
chicago allowing an hour for difference
in time this established a worlds record
for the distance for a stock-train
the live-stock limited



  eastmans first care monday morning
was to get those precious steers onto some
scales they weighed  pounds
which was  pounds less than when
they left chicago as this was an average
shrinkage of only twenty pounds a head
as compared with an average of seventy to
a hundred pounds per head on the ordinary
chicago-new york shipment he felt he
had good reason to be pleased

  fast stock runs were sadly overdone in
the old days on the granger lines when-
ever a few cars of cattle or hogs were cor-
raled the lucky line that captured the prize
would proceed to pull things to pieces to
get those cars over the road regardless of
other traffic or the condition of the road or
anything else often stock extras were run
with half the tonnage the engines were ca-
pable of hauling

  things reached such a pass that in
april  j m whitman general man-
ager of the chicago and northwestern
sent a long letter to all the other chicago-
missouri river lines protesting against the
stock-train speed mania he advocated a
safe and sane policy in handling live-stock
traffic that would enable the roads to pick
up an honest dollar now and then this
letter had a sobering effect and things be-
gan to mend in the stock traffic

not sufficient cars

  now the principal trouble of the man-
agement is found in the fact that there is
but one day in the stock-shippers week
every shipper wants to land his shipment
on the market bright and early monday
morning

   as there are but seventy thousand stock-
cars in the united states according to the
latest available figures of the interstate
commerce commission it takes some head-
work to make them go round

   just to show how the live-stock traffic is
bunched it may be said that on saturday
february   the chicago and north-
western received orders for twelve hundred
stock-cars to be loaded at various points
on its lines for deliver on the markets the
following monday the cars were all de-
livered on time and one thousand and fifty
of them were loaded and shipped

   on the following saturday eight hundred
and fifty stock-cars were ordered and eight
hundred were loaded and shipped in the
brief space of ten hours one august day

    	rr

in  the santa fe hauled five hundred
cars of live stock over a single division
into the kansas city market

getting them into the cars

   if the officials have their troubles in
handling live-stock traffic so also have the
trainmen it is easy enough to throw a
string of empties in on the stock - yard
track but it isnt so pleasant to sit around
for hours particularly in hot and cold
weather waiting for a lot of fellows who
don t know how to load the cars particu-
larly while you realize that dinner will be
spoiled beyond redemption before you can
get home

   loading cattle and hogs is not easy par-
ticularly when you dont know how and
most village stock - buyers do not know
they  open the proceedings by thrashing
wildly about and yelling like a tribe of
comanches doing a war-dance until the
whole drove is on the verge of nervous pros-
tration in that condition two steers run
out of the car for every one that goes in

  many a brakeman has watched such a
performance until tears of anguish coursed
down his cheeks and he harbored dark
thoughts of committing murder or mayhem
at the very least upon the blatant mob that
is creating such a hullabaloo

   if he is wise however he will put away
the longing to shed the blood of his fellow
man and especially will he stifle any indis-
creet desire to jump in and show em how
it is done

  marty williams my partner once dis-
regarded this wise precept after the vil-
lage stock-buyer and his cohorts had de-
layed the train a mortal hour to demon-
strate their profound ignorance of the art
of loading hogs they had only succeeded
in getting half a shoat into the car the
front half stuck out into the chute where
it maintained a vigilant guard to prevent
any others from entering marty could
stand it no longer

marty shows them how

   uttering cutting remarks about showing
them yaps how to load hogs he climbed
the fence and charging bravely up the
chute atthe shoat which was giving such
an excellent imitation of horatio at the
bridge he waved his arms and shouted aj
loud  sibbooey 	


the railroad mans magazine

  this was more than any self-respecting
hog could be expected to brook but marty
didnt know as much about hogs then as he
did a little later the old fellows mus-
cles stiffened visibly as his insulter rushed
up the chute his bristles stood erect and
his eyes snapped fire as he peered from un-
der his ears while he slowly brought his
nose up to charge bayonets

  when marty was within four feet of
him that three-hundred-pound shoat leaped
forward as if he had been shot from a gun
his nose went between martys legs while
his broad shoulders tripped the imperti-
nent brakeman up and brought him stom-
ach down face to the rearmupon the pork-
ers broad back

  with legs and arms sprawled out and
thrashing the air impotently marty rode
gaily down the chute and through the
squealing drove in the pen never have i
seen such a look of profound astonishment
on mortal face as mart- wore for a few
fleeting seconds

  it did not last long for that shoat ma-
king straight for a pool of semi-liquid mud
in one corner wheeled suddenly upon its
brink and dumped his rider neatly in the
middle of it marty had to be washed
down with a garden-hose by the time this
was done some farmers who happened along
had loaded the hogs

where the shipper suffers

  even after they are inthe car both cat-
tle and hogs still retain a remarkable ca-
pacity for making trouble for this reason
there are always attendants with every ship-
ment to keep the damage down as much as
possible

  fat hogs are liable to get smothered or
to die of heat in summer at water-tanks
a brakeman holds the valve open walking
along the train as it moves under him to
give the hogs a shower-bath

  cattle are the worst once a steer gets
down his chances are small for the rest
will trample and gore him to death unless
the attendants can get him up promptly

  the stockmen in charge of a shipment of
eighteen cars of mexican steers bound for
denver on the santa fe in june 
managed to get left behind at la junta
some of the cattle got down which started
a fight in one car

  the noise and the smell of blood started
all theothers to fighting and for the next

half-hour eighteen car - loads of battling
steers went bowling across the prairies the
trainmen could do nothing so the riot went
on until the combatants were exhausted
when it was all over twelve cattle had
been killed and twenty others were so bad-
ly hurt that they died soon after

  some obstreperous steers on a union
pacific train bound for omaha gave brake-
man frank monahan a chance to prove that
lie possessed both courage and presence of
mind the steers managed to knock a door
off and three or four promptly jumped out
while the train was running monahan
who was on top where all good trainmen
were supposed to be in the days of the
armstrong brake saw the door go and the
steers jump

  realizing that a car-load of good beef
would be spilled upon the prairie unless
something was done very quickly he sprint-
ed back to the stock-car climbed down the
ladder and sidled along the slats to the
open-door where he stood hanging on with
one hand threatening the steers with his
cap in the other hand and yelling he
kept this up until the train came to stop
at the next station and help came he
saved the beef

  if it were not for the railroads people
in cities could not have porterhouse steak
for dinner every time they wanted it prior
to  all cattle were driven to market
in  three men drove one hundred and
nineteen head of beef cattle from lexington
kentucky to new york a distance of
eight hundred miles in ten weeks

  not infrequently cattle were driven all
the way from iowa to new york city and
sheep were driven from oregon to ne-
braska every year cattle by the hundred
thousand were driven from texas to the
grazing-grounds in montana and dakota

first shipment to new york

  in  one of the first important ship-
ments of live stock to the new york mar-
ket was made it consisted of a hundred
head of cattle which were driven from lex-
ington kentucky to cincinnati where they
were loaded in cars and shipped to cleve-
land there they were put on a steamboat
which took them to buffalo where they
were again transferred to cars for the jour-
ney to albany new york

  at the latter place the final transfer to
a steamboat was made on which they went
the live-stock limited



down the hudson to new york the cost
was fourteen dollars for the entire distance

  as soon as rail routes from texas to the
northern grazing - grounds were available
the great overland drives came to an end
live-stock traffic played an important part
in keeping the santa fe afloat in the early
days  at this period the company could
not afford the luxury of a fence and the
consequence was that the cost of damages
for live stock killed by trains rose from
 in  to  in 

freight rates on cattle

  now the average cost of hauling cattle
from texas to montana ranges from 
to  per head as compared with an
average cost of  per head for the over-
land drive but there were heavy losses in
the drives and the cattle reached the north
late and in poor condition now that they
travel in luxury the cattle reach the range
early and thus have months more in which
to put on weight

  the loss is negligible the cost in-
cludes the drive to the station in texas
freight at  to  a car feed on the
way at  per car at each unloading-point

and caretakers at  a car and the cost of
driving from the station to the ranges

  from the northern ranges to chicago the
cost runs from  to  per head
the freight rate being from thirty-five to
sixty-six cents a hundred pounds and the
switching charges  a car from chicago
to new york the rate is twenty-eight cents
a hundred pounds while from new york
to london the ocean charges range from
 to  a head to which must be
added hay for fourteen days at  to
 a head and attendance at fifty to
sixty cents each to ship a two-hundred-
pound hog from missouri to chicago costs
from seventy cents to 

  the standard stock-car has an average
capacity of twenty-nine tons in shipping
to the range thirty-five head of cattle can
be put into a car but after fattening
twenty-five head make a load

  the average beef weighs about nine hun-
dred and fifty-five pounds but a choice
export steer weighs around twelve hundred
and fifty pounds and will yield about seven
hundred pounds of dressed beef hogs av-
erage seventy - five to the car while a
double-decked car will hold two hundred
and forty sheep

keep at the well eye

nine persons out of every ten with a cinder
or any other foreign substance in the eye
will instantly begin to rub it with one hand while
hunting for a handkerchief with the other this
is all wrong

  the right way is not to rub the eye with the
cinder in it but to rub the other as vigorously
as you like

  a few months ago i was riding on the engine
of a fast express says a traveler the engineer
threw open the front window of the cab and i
caught a cinder in my eye which gave me pain

  i began to rub the eye desperately when the
engineer called to me v

   let that eye alone and rub the other one

   thinking he was chaffing me i only rubbed the
harder

  i know the doctors think they know it all
but they dont and if you will let that eye alone
and work on the other one you will soon have the
cinder out shouted the engineer

   i did as he directed and soon felt the cinder
down near the inner canthus and made ready to
take it out

   let it alone and keep at the well eye again
shouted the engineer

   i did so for a minute longer and then looking
into a small glass the engineer handed me i saw
the offender on my cheek i have tried it many
times since always with success-the interior

   velocity

the velocity of steam escaping under pressure
is known to be very great though few are
aware that even under a moderate pressure of
say twenty or thirty pounds to the square inch
it is generally speaking equal to that of a pro-
jectile fired from a cannon a notable example
of the high velocity of escaping steam is that of
a steam whistle in which a jet of steam little
thicker than ordinary writing-paper produces a

of steam

           

sound that can be heard farther than the loudest
thunder the writer has often heard a railroad
whistle eighteen to twenty miles away while
thunder is seldom heard over ten or twenty miles
every engineer knows how little his safety-valve
lifts while the whole current of steam required
to run his engine escapes therefrom and how
small a leak in a valve will cause his engine tc
 creep provided his piston-packing is tight

no -what do you suppose will happen when a superstitious woman
with a phoney dollar moves to ohio and leaves
her cat behind

vhy is it that a woman
 will swat and scowl and
 scold all day then fon-
 dle the cat in the eve-
 ning   asked the bill
 clerk

  for the same reason replied the rate
clerk who is wise beyond his years he
has to be wise to be a rate clerk that a
man will kick a boy and whistle to a
dog

   why is either or both   asked the
check clerk who should have hurried out to
itemize the household goods from the van
that had just backed up at the freight-
house door

  the agent looked wise selected a few
healthy websterians and handed them out
thus

 professor broadpate of tweedledee
university says primordial man and the
primeval dog occupied the cliff cave to-
gether until the abysmal friendship be-
came instinctive and has endured through-
out all ages

  the agent tilted his head and glared
through his bifocal glasses with a superior
wisdom

  thereupon the rate clerk thrust his nose
into icc  muttered something about
see note  q  same as weehawken ar-
bitrary differential note paragraph c
rule  same as oyster bay only dif-
ferent wilkesbarre base harlem divi-
sions lcl not accepted embargo on
cl-

  the bill clerk lit onto the billing ma-
chine with a clatter which answered for
applause the check clerk took tardy no-
tice of the call of the drayman which had
grown grossly vociferous

  the agent resumed the perusal of a claim
wherein it was set forth that five pounds
of prunes had escaped from a sack by
reason of a hole caused by a nail in the
floor of the car and entailing a total loss
of forty-two cents subscribed and sworn
to etc etc

  this bit of curiosity on the part of the
clerks and the scientific explanation on the
part of the agent were brought about by
a little incident of the day before

  a woman shipped her household goods
to another state the drayman with a van
unloaded them into the freight-house

  then the woman appeared at the freight-
house office worried tattered and dishev-
eled to perform the last sad rites of signing
the shipping order and releasing the goods
to the prescribed valuation

   sign your name right there explained
an obliging clerk yes right on that
line your first name in full and then
again on that line

  you write it im so frustrated i
cant she said

  youll have to sign it- protested the
clerk we cant sign it for you

  then youll have to hold this cat
exclaimed the woman

  she made a hocus-pocus movement and
drew from the folds of her shawl a scrasisv

cat it had a sad hate-to-leave-my-happy-
home look and gave a wild you-are-the-
cause-of-this-blink at the clerk who backed
off a few feet

 set it down on the floor

 it might get away its so scared
poor thing you hold him a minute-and
be careful

the clerk lent a reluctant hand the

any of you gentlemen want a nice cat to
take home with you   she held him
up arched and limp for inspection

  whats his name   asked the bill
 clerk

 tobias

  i dont like the name

 land sakes  you could call him some-
 thing else couldnt you  

 jnorman lynd

do any of you gentlemen

    want a nice cat to take
    home with you  

 cat squirmed uneasily and cast suspicious
 slants

the woman labored with her first name
left a blot and ruined a pen

 dont see what you have me do that
for she growled  its just red tape
aint it

 we have to have it that way
grunted the clerk twelve sixty pay
the cashier there

 the commercial transaction being out of
 the way she again assumed the custody of
 the cat

raising her voice she called out do

  it might hurt his feel-
 ings

 cats dont care so you
feed them well and they
have a warm place to lay
around they are just like
men you would like to-
bias he aint what you
would call a stylish cat bui
lie is a good cat he stays
so dost hes just like one
of the family

  why do you want to give him away
im gloving to ohio its bad luck to
move a cat laws a me i thought every-
body knew that

  what would happen asked the rate
clerk

   some of the family would die or the
house would burn down or we would lose
all our money or something else dreadful
would happen its bad luck to move a
cat i wouldnt take the risk

  we ought to have a nice hand-raised
home-bred cat around this office but you
will have to see the cashier about it


the railroad mans magazine

   i wouldnt want him to stay here the
cars might run over him poor tobias
that would be awful i would just as soon
have the bad luck myself as to have tobias
run over

  ill tell you what you do said the
rate clerk  take him over to the ticket
office and give him to chauncy the ticket
man hell take anything any one wants
to give him

  she went across chauncy looked the
cat over with the inspection of a live-stock
expert and delivered a critical opinion

  dont seem to be angora or tortoise-
shell or chartreuse or chinese mixed
strain mostly tabby and tom who told
you i wanted a cat   asked chauncy

   they sent me over here from the
freight-house they said youd take him
i am moving to ohio i cant take him
along its a bad luck you know to move
a cat

  thats right said chauncy never
move a cat or youll lose your teeth or your
hair will come out or some other dreadful
thing will happen thats me im liable
to move any time and id have to leave
him that would be sadder than i could
bear hes not one of them kilkenny cats
is he hes not one of them midnight
prowlers and porch-climbers is he does
lie cultivate vognerian orchestra and grand
opera associations

  oh my no tobias aint that kind
tobias-

  is that his name tobias flossy
name all right toby for short

  tobias just lays around where its
warm and comfortable and purrs and
mews and tends to his own business

   thats fine  returned chauncy  i
wouldnt mind having that kind of a job
myself did cu ask the cashier at the
freight-house if he would take him-the
one with the glasses and the bald head
try him then see the agent himself the
elderly man with a scared but fatherly
look hes hardened to all kinds of purr-
ing mewing and yowling and one extra
performer thrown in wouldnt make any
particular difference to him thats the
happy-home solution for tobias

  the woman retraced on the freight-
house platform she met the old drayman
who had crated and delivered her goods

  what cried the drayman you aint
takin that cat along air you you surely
wouldnt do anything like that woman

would you if you take a cat along with
you nothin would ever go right again
give him away to some one 

   im trying to replied the woman
eagerly  do you know some one who will
take him and give him a nice home i
dont want to leave him around here he
might get run over with the cars

  let me see pondered the drayman
gravely  maybe i could fix it let me
think a minute

  the drayman gave an imitation of going
into the matter of providing a home for
tobias very thoroughly he made a num-
ber of calculations of available homes in
the mental strain incident thereto he sat
down on a barrel of glassware with legs
relaxed presently he brightened up

   theres something about these signs
maam that people generally dont under-
stand you see im a drayman ive been
movin people coinin twenty-five years next
march or is it april no its march-
th of march-coinin twenty-five years
the th of march thats it ive moved
millions maybe not that many but thou-
sands of families anyhow some people
dont pay any attention to signs and luck
and dont believe in em-but i do i cau-
tion em all dont take the cat or the
broom or break the lookin-glass thems
three things that mustnt be done breakin
the lookin-glass is worst of all if the
lookin-glass gits broke some one in the
family will die ive paid particular at-
tention to that it never fails

   do they die hard   asked the woman
anxiously

  most of em do replied the drayman
with grave assurance  most of em come
to a violent end

  maybe id better leave the looking-
glass too said the startled woman

   it wont do any good continued the
drayman  its yours you cant get
away from it if you would leave it and
some one else thats careless would break it
the bad luck ud come to you not them
see but ive packed it so it wont break
i know the responsibility thats on me
when im packin the lookin-glass in
yourn theres a pillow in front and another
behind and all wrapped up with two com-
forts i reckon if they break that theyll
haft to use dynamite instead of just durned
carelessness

  now about a broom if you take a
broom along youll have a fire and burn
observations of a country station-agent



 out and thats mighty bad just for an old
 broom i never let a family move a broom
 if theyre ignorant or stubborn i hide em
 or stick em under the seat of my van

 ive saved many a family that wouldnt
 thought of it theirselves i am always
 lookin to protect my customers that im
 doing draying for thats me  help
 them that helps me thats my motto

   no of course not your broom aint
 with your household goods i seen to
 that when you get to piqua youll be
 short a broom it aint no joke its for
 your good but that
 cat if you move
 that cat youll lose
 all your money

 thats what movin
 a cat does  

   wont you take
 him please do
 pleaded the woman
 half frantic-
 ally holding the
 wild and wonder-
 ing-eyed the hoo-
 dooed and outcast
 tobias at arms
 length toward the
 drayman

  the drayman
 shrunk from the re-
 sponsibility of the
 charge

  id like to
 mum but i cant

 id haft to kill him

 i cant have cats
 around my place

 id have to make
 way with him i
 could put him
 out-

   no no cried
 the woman hugging the blinking and un-
 conscious nemesis to her bosom in protec-
 tion  tobias aint goin to be killed 
 the drayman brightened up with a new
 thought

   theres another thing about luck and
 hoodoos and the like they sure do play
 queer pranks lady ive been movin peo-
 jle so long ive learned all about such
 things alf the way from friday an the
 dark of the moon to the lookin -glass now
 take that cat there the drayman raised
 his finger and pointed with a wise and
 impressive gesture  take that cat there

if youd take him along with you yourself
move him with you a purpose you under-
stand youd have all kinds of bad luck
but listen if that cat would happen to
find you or follow you to your new home
hisself and you wouldnt know anything
about it or have any hand in it it would be
just as much good luck the other way as it
would be bad luck a takin him along aint
they some queer freaks to luck maam 
but tobias couldnt follow us pro-
tested the woman were movin to
ohio

   cats do some wonderful things as-
sured the drayman  dumb animals have
got instincts that we dont know anything
bout they turn up sometimes when only
heaven knows how they git there they
got senses what we aint got

  the drayman posed thoughtfully then
his face lighted up with a sudden solution

   i got it lady leave it to me i know
where i can place your cat where it will
have the same care you give it ill see
that it gits a good home

  he reached over with coarse red hands
and gripped tobias


the railroad mans magazine

the red cross didnt arrive any too soon

 are you sure hell be well treated
 asked the woman dubiously

  dead certain lady i know the
 family

  and will you tell him we boil the milk
 for him and always keep a pink ribbon
 round his neck hes ust to it

 ill see they understand it lady

  and always feed him on a blue china
 plate hes never eaten on anything else

 yes mum

  and have him always sleep in a feather
 bed hes never slept on a mattress

   yes mum theyll understand all about
it

   and when they have porterhouse steak
feed him the lean under the bone its
the tenderest you know hes never had
anythin else

 	o

   its a little trouble for me maam but
ill do all i can theyll understand it
and theyll treat him just the same as you
do you can depend on my word for that
as i say it will take a little of my time
of course it will be worth a little some-
thing 

  will a dollar pay the bill

  yes mum i reckon that will be
enough

  he pocketed the coin and turned his head
while there took place the sad scene of part-
ing in which there was a confusion of en-
dearing caresses affectionate names and
smothered osculations

  the drayman got away with the cat
when the woman turned her back he slipped
into the freight-house where her household
goods were being trucked into a car among
the effects was a coop of chickens

  the drayman pried up a slat and slipped
tobias in with the chickens then he re-
nailed the slat

   thats easy money chuckled the dray-
man to the freight-house man  i have
found a happy home- for tobias hes
goin along shell be tickled to death when
she opens up them plymouth rocks and out
jumps tobias

  it was a clever idea neatly executed and
was played according to the rules of that
inscrutable fate that determines the differ-
ence between good luck and bad that makes
a fine distinction between the cat that was
taken along and the cat that was sent

  the only blunder in the whole arrange-
ment was on the part of the drayman who
possessing those human qualities of exul-
tation and braggadocio over little triumphs
held up the silver dollar and chuckled glee-
fully and triumphantly to the freight-house
man

   aint i in on that   asked the freight-
house man

  well i guess not replied the dray-
man  you aint played no part in it i
explained all about movin luck to her it
was me that figgered out the way for her
to git her cat and save her luck too thats
expert advice people haft to pay for ex-
pert advice same as goin to see a doctor or
a lawyer
observations of a country station-agent



  well im checkin these goods re-
sponded the freight-house man  the
way-bill and bill ladin call for one coop
of chickens they dont read mixed load
chickens and cats they dont read even
one cat there aint no cat goin to dead-
head through on this billing

  the situation was something like getting
sugar or my ladys finery through the cus-
tom-house where in times past and per-
haps in times to come there seems to be the
ancient and homely way of putting some-
thing across by slipping the coin into an
upturned palm

  it is a crude and awkward procedure but
the freight-house man was ugly and obsti-
nate and stood firmly on the hair-splitting
distinction that one coop of chickens was
not one coop of chickens when it contained
one cat and that classification rules must
be observedto the letter if the coop was
billed  chickens it must be  chickens  
if billed  cats then cats it must be

  the matter was compromised by the dray-
man paying the freight-house man a silver
quarter

  the drayman went into the office

  the freight-house man gave the coin a
critical inspection it was a smooth quar-

ter and it aroused suspicion there are
places where they pass but for twenty cents
the freight-house man had misgivings that
the drayman had purposely short-changed
and fiimmed him out of five cents in the
double-dealing transaction

  obeying an impulse of resentment under
the guise of doing his duty he pried up a
slat and lifted tobias out of berth no 
and renailed the coop

  the draymans moving-van was standing
near the freight-house door and the freight-
house-man slipped tobias into it where he
cuddled up in some straw under the seat
oblivious of the departure and distress of
his mistress unconscious of the intrigues of
which he was the central figure and un-
concerned for the future

  the woman took the next passenger-train
for ohio assured that tobias was to be
well cared for and secure in the faith that
no ill-luck was incurred in the process of
moving

  later the drayman took up some freight
bills and passed some coins over the counter
to the cashier

  the cashier slid a silver dollar back to
him

  not at this bank said the cashier

j normaw lvnp

the drayman pried op
a slat and slipped
tobias in with the
chickens


the railroad mans magazine

see how blue that is feel it just like
oleomargarin put your teeth on that and
get the grit thats glass and pewter you
ought not to lug that kind of hardware
around to say nothing of trying to pass it
as money look out for uncle sam 

  the drayman blinked his eyes in a baf-
fled and perplexed manner rubbed the coin
and bit it

   that woman what moved to ohio gave
me that im dead certain said he

  the thing for you to do is to drop it in
the well-advised the cashier before an
officer nabs you

  what would they do to me if id pass
that on some one

   if yoii didnt know it was bogus they
would simply make you takj it back in
exchange for real money since you know
its bad if you try to keep it in circulation
youre a standing candidate for the striped-
garment colony you cant plead that you
didnt know for you do know every min-
ute you walk around with that piece of
metal in your pocket you are an uncaught
criminal if you try to pass it on me again
i may see that some one knows of it who
ought to know by the way what did you
do with that womans cat

  im sending it to her jts with the
household goods i slipped it in the coop
with the chickens its not bad luck to send
a cat its bad luck to take one-

   save that kind of talk for the women
protested the cashier if that cat kills a
bunch of chickens on the journey you may
and it bad luck to send one dont forget
that

   i had some bad luck last night said
the drayman mournfully to the freight-
house man a day or two later

   hows that   asked the freight-house
man

   you know that pointer pup of mine that
i paid ten dollars for last month theys
a stray cat around my barn last night almost
put him out of business i heard an awful
rumpus out at the barn about two oclock
and i lit the lantern and went out there
the pup was all clawed up hed been in
a mix with that cat and the red cross
didnt arrive any too-soon i took him up
to the house and patched him up i thought
one of his eyes was gone but i guess hell
be all right after a day or two they cant
anybodys cat hang around my premises
i got no use for a cat anyway

   hows the pup coming along by this

time asked the freight-house man of the
drayman the day following

   i got him shut up in the crib a pups
got no business with a cat i aint feelin
very well to-day i didnt get much sleep
last night that same durned cat i was
tellin you about yowled and howled around
my place all night i sailed out after him
three times but he got away every time
about the time id git back to bed hed
slip up a little closter and let out another
one of them solos of hisn say have you
still got that double-barreled shotgun you
ust to have  

  the freight-house man nodded his head

  bring it down will you that cats
too fresh i want to pump both barrels
into him

   say said the drayman next day  this
is gittin something fierce you know what
that cat done last night killed six of my
little buff plymouth rock chicks out of that
settin of eggs that cost me five dollars a
while back

   i forgot to bring the gun said the
freight-house man but ill have it here
to-morrow noon thats sure

  that night the drayman with great care
and deliberation prepared a pate of ham-
burg steak a la strychnin and placed the
succulated tidbit at the spot under the barn
from which the midnight marauder would
most likely issue forth during the night
he heard the creeping tread and the familiar
call at early dawn he slipped out to gloat
over death and destruction

  what he saw filled him with fury the
pointer pup lay near-by in cold and stonj
death in one bunch of convulsions he
had passed from this vale of cats

  in some way hehad gotten out of the
crib and had beaten the cat to the fatal
offering he was a desperate drayman
at noon he got the double-barrel shotgun
from the freight-house man

  when the drayman appeared at the depot
next day the right side of his face was
done in courtplaster and absorbent cotton

   i loaded her too heavy he explained
to the freight-house man  i got one good
shot but she sputtered and kicked andnear-
ly put me out of business i forgot to hold
her tight you got to hold a shotgun tight
that shoulders pretty sore and theres
some skin off my cheek and neck but doc
dressed em up

   i set that gun last night right where
i could get it handy i dont know how

   its burglars in the house said she

    its that durned cat ses i crawlin

of yourn

   right then there come an awful crash
of china from the sideboard two jumps
and i was in the kitchen just as pussy made
a wild leap from the sideboard to the open
window now i aint no buffalo bill or
doc carver but i just let loose both barrels
in the general direction and it brought on
our glorious independence day with pin-
wheels and skyrockets and shooting stars

  what would our magnificent country
be if it hadnt been for george washington
three cheers for the old hag let the band
play them were the fleeting emotions i
had i didnt git up for a good while be-
cause my wife fainted and i had to come
to first as quick as i could i went out
and looked all around but they wasnt any
scattered remains

what are you doing with that gun

    i aint goin to wait until night any
more im goin right after him this after-
noon they aint goin to be nothin else
done until i pump that cat full of buck-
shot

  the noon train from ohio brought in a
woman passenger she crossed the track
and made a bee-line for the freight-house
man

   im the woman that had my goods
shipped to piqua ohio the other day she
explained  maybe you can tell me where
that drayman lives that hauled my things
to the depot i gave him my cat and paid
him to find it a good home the first night
i got to piqua i had an awful dream about
tobias i dreamed he was an outcast and
was being hunted down to be killed last
night i dreamed it again

  when you dream a dream two times
its a presentiment and a warning some
people might call it foolish but i dont do
you believe in dreams

  not as a rule maam replied the
freight-house man  but this onct you
dreamed it exactly right that cat of yourn
is hanging around that draymans barn and
the drayman got a shotgun and right this
minute hes trying to draw a bead on to-


the railroad mans magazine

bias to fill him full of buckshot maybe
youre too late now-

   show me quick  cried the woman
excitedly

  he gave her hurried directions and she
lit out

  the drayman was patrolling the prem-
ises-sort of reconnoitering as it were-
when the woman came upon him

  what are you doing with that gun
she demanded shrilly

  nothin much maam he answered
without looking up  just huntin for a
stray cat thats been raisin the dickens
around here for the last week

  the woman darted into the barn in
two minutes she emerged carrying the gaunt
and fugitive tobias she found him by a
hocus-pocus hindu instinct then she
thrust a clinched fist under the draymans
nose

  you villain you wretch you swin-
dler you took my dollar to find tobias a
good home and here he is under this barn
and you a hunting him with that gun
give me back that dollar 

  the drayman weighed two hundred and
was armed to the teeth nevertheless he wilt-
ed into a foolish helplessness against this
onslaught without a word he dug down
and handed over the coin that the woman
demanded

  the woman lugged tobias back to the
freight-house where he was amply fed and
tucked away into a basket

memorial to

preparations are being made by the
baltimore and ohio railroad to erect a
tablet to the memory of phineas davis inventor
of the first coal-burning locomotive in america
whose body occupies an unmarked grave in the
cemetery of the old friends meeting house at
york pennsylvania

  the career of davis is among the most ro-
mantic of american inventors beginning as an
apprentice to jonathan jessop a noted watch and
clock maker he created a sensation in  by
producing a perfect time-piece no larger than a
nickel later while he was connected with the
firm of webb davis  gardner machinists he
had a share in the -building of the first iron
steamboat in america which was launched on
the susquehanna river in  the baltimore
and ohio offered a prize of s for a coal-
burning locomotive that would excel all others

   i have you to thank said the woman
 warmly to the freight-house man  for sav-
 ing his life i am thinking i ought to
 give you a quarter

    she held out the same silver dollar

   the freight-house man pocketed the coin
 and dug up seventy-five cents return change
 for the woman by an artful manipulation
 the smooth quarter was the middle coin in
 the transfer

    tobias traveled to ohio first class lower
 middle -in the basket jealously guarded and
 every want anticipated

    it may be bad luck to move a cat
 philosophized the woman  but its a whole
 lot worse luck ter leave him behind and
 when you dream the same dream twice
 thats a sign its time to act

   in the evening the freight-house man
 asked the cashier to change the dollar

    out of my sight with it  cried the
 money man look at it feel of it its
 made of putty thats the second one of
 those paste dollars this week avant 

    say said the freight-house man next
 day to the drayman  i wish youd killed
 that infernal cat before that female got
 to you	

   howd that cat git there asked the
 drayman

   moral nb and ps-never overwork
 and never capitalize a womans little super-
 stitions

   moral nb and ps no -keep the
 lead dollars away from the freight cashier

phineas davis

 in a competitive test and in this davis won over
 peter cooper and other noted american inventors
 he was then taken into the service of the com-
 pany and three years later as a result of many
 experiments he brought out another engine which
 was claimed to be superior to anything that had
 been produced in america or england prior to
 that time

    on the trial-trip ovar rails laid on wooden
 stringers davis lost his life through the breaking
 of one of the rails he was only forty years old
 at the time of his death and as the development
 of motive power advanced he was forgotten
 through achievements that overshadowed what he
 had done -his case was lately brought to the
 attention of the railroad company by the secretary
 of the york county historical society said to be
 the only man living familiar with the location of
 the grave
some sand and much gravel

by guy g baker

               business is business even if cupid inter-
               rupts the plans of a railroad builder

ith that self-satisfied
demeanor that betokens
the divestment of busi-
ness routine for some
pleasant recreation
richard collier
stepped onto the porch of the small frame
office and softly humming some nondescript
air glanced along throad that zigzagged
itself into perspective over the hills

  his eyes then wandered complacently
along the ridge of hills extending for sev-
eral miles in either direction parallel with
the railroad that shimmered drearily under
the slanting rays of the afternoon sun

  he watched the swarms of laborers toil-
ing on the slopes he could hear the fussy
engines of the steam shovels as they poked
their cyclopean noses farther and farther
into the great banks of gravel he noted the
long gravel train worm its way out of the
pits as one by one the empties were mag-
ically filled by the giant shovels

  those hills were literally colossal heaps
of gravel from base to summit they
were veritable gold mines-only the gold
was gravel colliers complacency was jus-
tifiable he owned those hills

  a number of years before the hills and
surrounding uncultivated country had been
owned by an eccentric old fellow named
job de kemp de kemp died leaving a
will in which he devised all his property
to a trustee with power to sell lease or
rent in trust for his niece mara de kemp

  the will provided further that the leases
and rentals should terminate and all the
estate become the absolute property of and
be turned over to the niece at her marriage
on the failure of the niece to marry or in
the event of her death before marriage the

vast estate was to go to certain charitable
institutions

  the railroad company had early leased
a right of way back through the hills over
which they built a switch to the isolated
pits of a man named senman shortly
after richards father purchased all the
de kemp land subject to the lease of the
railroad company at the death of the
senior collier richard had inherited the
valuable hills with their rich deposits

  but the meditations of this practical
hustling young man just at that particu-
lar moment were neither occupied with the
singular history of his possessions nor with
the noisy activity before him

   his reflection carried him to more felici-
tous byways-he was thinking of her
wherever man lives there never has been
business cares so complex as to entirely ex-
clude a her in fact ever since that
memorable day when this particular her
unexpectedly appeared at snooks farm and
was ceremoniously ensconced in the spare
bedroom-a distinction that indubitably
marked her as the star boarder-his
thoughts had been of her

  that first evening richard had searched
out his gracious landlady and proceeded to
ply her with a fusillade of questions con-
cerning-the fair newcomer but to his sur-
prise that amiable person a mischievous
twinkle in her eyes only said

  now you pay tention to me mr dick
and dont you forget what aunty snooks
tells you neither i aint lowed to tell
you who that young lady is nor nothin
bout her- i know who she is and i know
she is perticrly all right and a lady from
the ground up and thats sfficient be-
sides what business is-




the railroad mans magazine

  stop snooks for heavens sake stop
protested collier with a laugh ill bridle
my curiositv but how am i to address
her

   you aint got  business addressing
her as i know of was mrs snookss good-
natured sally as she turned and plunged
into her culinary tasks

  with that the young man was compelled
to be satisfied and although he could learn
but little concerning the refined well-
groomed girl with her wealth of sunny
hair and her eyes of quiet gray yet he was
firmly convinced from the very first that
she was the loveliest bit of femininity that
he had ever run across

  but mrs snookss well-intended cir-
cumspection was hopelessly futile in its
effort to cope with an impressionable hot-
blooded young lady marooned in a pic-
turesque quiet country home with a de-
termined vigorous good-looking young man
with an automobile

  at the end of a week richard and  miss
mystery -his name for her-were insepa-
rable at the end of two weeks even mrs
snooks capitulated unconditionally with

   well let them go gallagher aint
they both thoroughbreds

  thus the little romance progressed by
forced marches until only the evening
before richard had tenderly whispered the
old old theme into the willing ears of
miss mystery he was to have his an-
swer this very evening

  his agreeable reflections were rudely
interrupted by the fussy arrival of the
afternoon passenger-train which came to a
stop before the makeshift of a station
amid the rasping grind of air-brakes the
clanging of the bell and a cloud of dust
and smoke

  as young colliers heedless glance re-
garded the alighting passengers his pleas-
ant reverie was suddenly dispelled as he
recognized in one of the arrivals stutz
the superintendent of the road already
picking his way toward the office

  demmit gloomily murmured richard
i suppose old grump will keep me here
until dark again

  howdv collier greeted stutz with
his characteristic exasperating assurance
just ready for flight i observe well
i will detain you but a minute i merely
desired to mention the matter of the renew-
al of your shipping rates the present con-
tract expires to-day as you remember

   sure i remember stutz dick replied
as he clasped the visitors hand but ma-
king no move to enter the office  you did
not need come all the way out here to di-
vest yourself of that information

   but you see-

   pardon me stutz interrupted the
young man determined to head off what
he was convinced would develop into a two
hours confab  i have a pressing appoint-
ment and cannot take the time to draw up
a contract to-night just draft a new one
to-morrow and mail it to me for signing
 oh as to that smiled stutz in his
inscrutable manner that part will be all
right all right i assure you mr collier
however i simply desired to inform you
of the recent action of the company in rais-
ing your rate to-

  raising my rate broke in richard
incredulously

  yes to seventy cents a yard finished
the official imperturbably

   surely stutz you are not serious are
you faltered richard incredulity and
amazement strugglingfor dominance in his
eyes and voice

  never more serious in my life old
man was the emphatic answer  and the
increase goes into effect to-morrow 

  for the interval of a full half min-
ute richard stood speechless his face
ashen his eyes like glints from a flashing
rapier his lips compressed cruelly quick-
ly stepping down he faced stutz on the
level and burst out

   seventy cents why not seventy dol-
lats one is as reasonable as the other
why that is prohibitive worse it is ruin-
ous insane imbecilic ill see your lop-
eared burlesque of a dinky railroad in
hades first 

   dont talk foolishness calmly sug-
gested the superintendent you must sim-
ply adjust yourself to the new order of
things-merely raise prices-

   only the effervescence of an idiot
would suggest raising prices when the
crushed-stone people are yelping at our
heels now retorted richard angrily then
his face relaxed under the warmth of a new
hope as he triumphantly exclaimed  see
here now you people had just better cut
out this rate boosting business or i will
refuse to furnish another single yard for
the fills and ballast on your clifton ex-
tension  

  your estimate of our foresight is not
some sand and much gravel



flattering replied stutz with the demean-
or of one playing his trump card  but we
anticipated your action we will at once
relay our switch back over our right-of-
way through your property to the senmar
pits we will furnish our own gravel

  the dickens

   tut tut collier said the older man
quickly thats business you know thats
business think it over to-morrow af-
ternoon i will bring the new contract

  richard watched the superintendent de-
liberately turn and walk back toward the
station he was stupefied the bottom
of his business achievements seemed to have
dropped out of sight

  an undefined poignant sense of loss
crushed him he dared not attempt to
analyze his terrible disappointment

   slowly his glance wandered to the hills
-his hills teeming with activity to the
distant road and finally to the mouse-
colored machine a lump sprang up in his
throat the boyish buoyancy of five min-
utes before was gone the mist of emotion
blurred his sight

  with his eyes fixed on the ground he
slowly passed out to the waiting car with
one foot on the running-board he paused
and his eyes harboring a far away look
he murmured

    looks like its all up dick old boy-

 miss mystery  and all

ii

  the portentous mass of purplish-black
clouds was fast enshrouding the close of
the hot sultry july day in premature dark-
ness the unnatural stillness was oppress-
ive and disquieting distant thunder
rumbled ominously thp weird uncanny
light that yet remained intensified the
blackness in the west all nature seemed
awaiting the storm-motionless breathless

  casting frequent anxious glances over
his shoulder at the threatening clouds rich-
ard collier grimly gripped the steering-
wheel as the powerful automobile hurled
along the country road in a mad race to
reach snookss farm

   with terrific swiftness the whirring ma-
chine swept down rockaway hill bumped
over the little bridge at the bottom and
momentum undiminished sped up the steep
hill beyond

   racing over the summit it flashed past
the hurrying form of a girl the fleeting

glimpse that collier had of her as he
passed revealed a glorious fear-imprinted
face that made his heart stand still

  it was miss mystery

  savagely shoving back the emergency
lever and jamming down the foot-brake he
brought the throbbing car to an abrupt stop
springing to the ground he opened the door
to the back seat and waited anxiously for
the hurrying girl

  hike in here hurry

    oh richard how fortunate  i was so
frightened  the storm   she was breath-
lessly pouring forth as she came up to his
side

   well beat it yet but we will have to
take to our heels broke in richard with
a tone of imperativeness without further
ceremony he boldly gathered the trembling
girl in his strong arms deposited her in the
roomy back seat slammed the door shut
sprang back into the drivers seat shoved
down the high-gear clutch and before the
girl could grasp the situation the car was
once more shattering the speed records

   a blinding vicious streak of fire rived
the black cloud wall with zizzag ferocity
and instantly the stillness was shattered
by the rending deafening crashing report
of a thousand pieces of ordnance

  with an apalling roar that drowned the
whirring whizzing machine the furies of
the air let loose in tumultuous pande-
monium

   the air was filled with flying leaves and
missies another flash of lightning and
peal of thunder and then a deluge of
blinding driving rain

   checking the speed of the machine col-
lier switched on the electric side-lights
then shouted back over his shoulder that
there were rain aprons under the seat
alarmed the girl drew the aprons about
her and tense and speechless under the
spell of the storm kept her eyes on the
broad square shoulders of the motionless
driver as he leaned over the wheel peering
anxiously ahead then it happened

   simultaneously with a terrific clap of
thunder and a dazzling glitter of heaven-
filled fire a mighty monarch of the forest
was struck ittrembled a moment then
with a mighty crash fell out over the road
in front of the flying car

   there was a jerking grind of the brake
a warning cry a terrific impact driver
and passenger were hurled into the dark-
ness-all in the span of a second


the railroad mans magazine

   collier landed violently in the road five
yards away he was instantly on his feet
he peered uncertainly about him in the
darkness he heard no sound save the
roar of the storm a flash of lightning re-
vealed the automobile with front wheels
perched high on the fallen tree he groped
his way in that direction

  reaching the machine he waited an-
other flash of lightning and he beheld the
motionless form of the girl lying a short
distance away he groped his way to her
side in the succeeding darkness with a
surge of thankfulness he quickly ascer-
tained that she still lived

  carefully wrapping his coat about her
he tenderly lifted her in his arms and
stumbling along the slippery road in the
darkness started for a small unoccupied
hut which he knew to be not far away

  once when the lightning momentarily
turned the blackness into day he looked
down into a pair of gray wondering eyes
that regarded him hazily presently a soft
arm crept up over his shoulder and about
his neck

  he pressed her closer vivified by the
warmth of her breath against his cheek
then the girls arm slipped limply from
about his neck and she swooned into a
dead weight

   collier reverently kissed her cheek

  at length-ages it seemed to collier-
stumbling along desperately he reached the
hut placing his precious burden on the
floor he paused for a moment to rest and
regain his breath

  carefully feeling his way in the dark-
ness he finally reached the old fireplace
in a familiar niche he found and lighted
a match which he quickly applied to some
ready kindling the flames were soon mer-
rily casting grotesque shadows on the walls
and removing afar the tumult of the out-
side storm

  turning to administer to his fair charge
he was confronted by the bewitching vision
of miss mystery her chin propped on
her shapely arms and a pair of quiet
gray eyes watching him in bewilderment

  collier sprang quickly to her side knelt
close before her gently took her hand be-
tween his own and searching her face
anxiously with deep solicitude said

   gee but wasnt that a bump are
you hurt

  no i think not-only somewhat
mixed she replied running her hand over

her damp hair but where are we and

how came we here  

   i really cannot clearly tell you just
how we did get here he smiled but we
are here-in the gloomy den of some bad
ogre in the midst of a vast forest-

  how charmingly romantic and you
-you are the fearless knight i suppose
then blushing  and just the proper set-
ting for the-for the answer

  richard suddeidy turned pale slowly
and silently he arose and assisted the girl
to her feet then taking her hands in
his he looked into her startled eyes with
calm determination a world of bitter re-
nunciation vibrating in his voice as he little
more than whispered

   i cannot permit you to give an answer
to-night

   i dont quite understand she mur-
mured tremulously

  he quietly led her to a chair and sat
down by her side

   i will explain he commenced then
in the mellow warmth of the fire the girl
silently and attentively listened while rich-
ard recited all the events of the day that
threatened to so materially alter his con-
dition when he had quite finished and
sat silent and dejected she leaned forward
and asked softly

    and is that all  

   all   he asked bitterly  is it not
enough  

  it is nothing nothing nothing

  with a happy little laugh she placed
two entrancinglv lovely arms about his
neck drew him close and - whispered
something into his ear

  the effect was electrical he sprang
to his feet lifted her and pressed her close
in his arms as he fervently kissed her
holding her from him for a moment he
exclaimed

   if the machine wasnt perched up in
that tree we would do it to-night 
why dick demurely suggested the
girl our grandfathers had no machines
a flash of understanding passed between
them laughing happily arm in arm
they passed out into the night

  the following afternoon when superin-
tendent stutz and the companys attorney
alighted from the afternoon train they
found young collier in his big machine
some sand and much gravel



the motor  already pulsating preparatory
to leaving

  you seem to be in a hurry volunteered
stutz his tone conveying a suggestion of
concern in spite of his outward assurance

   you are good at a guess nodded
richard flashing a puzzling smile at the
two visitors as he fulled on his gantlets

   better shut down your engine sug-
gested the superintendent  it will take
some time to look over the new rate con-
tract we want it signed-

   of course you do  richards enigmat-
ical good humor was getting on the nerves
of the dignified official  still seventy
cents i suppose  

  well yes you see-

    sure i see interrupted the young man
but let me put you next to something on
the dead level i wont sign it 

  dont be hasty warned the official
imperturbably shaking his head knowing-
ly you must surely appreciate the seri-
ous consequences of such a course

  consequences snapped richard his
eyes flashing a challenge his jaw muscles
twitching  i refuse to sign now what
are the consequences  

  we regret the necessity coldly an-

swered the official but the company will
at once relay their own switch

   a-h  i richard feigned deep interest
leaning toward stutz in a low quiet voice
he asked where

  why over our right-of-way through
your land of course was the retort

   you have no right-of-way corrected
richard softly

  stutz regarded richard for a moment
speechless half convinced that the young
man was positively crazy

   your lack of seriousness is consuming
the valuable time of both of us collier
scolded stutz impatiently  you know that
our lease lives as long as mara de kemp
provided always corrected richard
that mara de kemp does not marry
well jerked out the official in a
startled voice she is not-

   she is married

  i dont believe it exclaimed stutz
loudly  when and to whom  

   miss de kemp was married last night
-to me richard spoke very low but his
smile was loud-very loud

  the dickens

  tut tut stutz mimicked richard
thats business you know think it over

pennsylvania on trail of swindlers

      vertising swindlers are using the penn-
sylvania station in new york as a means
of perpetrating fraudulent schemes in many parts
of the country a number of these have been
brought to the attention of the pennsylvania rail-
road company

  one swindle which has been extensively worked
is that of a large advertising poster which it is
claimed will be hung in the pennsylvania station
in new york and in various other stations along
the lines of the company this poster contains a
large picture of the pennsylvania station sur-
rounded by advertisements

  a rather unique method is used by the solicitors
for this scheme in that they state that they do
not want any money only a signed contract and

the swedish state railways are at present con-
templating the adoption of a one-man loco-
motive for distances with a limited local traffic
and a commencement has already been made over

as the driver is not meant to manage the locomo-
tive entirely alone but the fireman has also to act

that the auditor of the pennsylvania railroad will

  the pennsylvania railroad officials state that
the company knows absolutely nothing about any
of these schemes and that it has no connection
whatever with any of them it was further stated
that it was a well-established policy of the penn-
sylvania railroad company not to have any ad-
vertising matter posted on its property

 the buffer and vestibule

by robert augustine

the life-saving characteristics of the air-brake the automatic coupler and
the semaphore have been recorded many times but-among other inven-
tions that have gone far toward making railroad travel a delight the
lowly buffer and the comfortable vestibule are frequently overlooked

    after all is said and done however and we get down to the real reasons
why the big pullman sleepers and the baggage mail and passenger-cars no
longer try to crawl inside of one another like folding lunch-boxes when the
train comes to a sudden and abrupt stop we find that it is the buffer and the
vestibule that keeps them in place

early devices which indicated what the simple inventions of ezra miller
and h h sessions would eventually accomplish in
making railroad travel safer

combined the air-brake alone excepted
any one who doubts this is invited to look
through the files of daily papers and tech-
nical journals before and after the intro-
duction of buffers and vestibules

  before ezra miller and h h sessions
appeared on the scene every account of a
collision-and collisions were numerous in
early days-included a long list of killed
and injured after millers safety plat-
form had been introduced these casualty
lists shrunk to moderate proportions and
after sessionss modern vestibule was adopt-
ed they nearly disappeared a fact upon
which the american public was felicitated
in columns of editorials

  these congratulations only lasted until
the wonderful inventions lost the zest of
novelty now they are forgotten

the first buffer-beam

  to appraise the vestibule and the buffer
at their true worth it is necessary to turn
back to the early history of the railroad
when the first train on the mohawk--and
hudson railroad pulled out of albany
new york on the morning of august 



ext time you board a train
pause long enough to take
off your hat to the buffer
and the vestibule so quiet-
ly and so unobtrusively are
their inestimable services
performed every hour of the day and night
on every railroad in the land that no one
ever gives these lowly portions of the equip-
ment so much as a grateful look to say
nothing of the appreciation they deserve

  on the contrary the buffer is trodden un-
der foot without a thought by the fidgety
traveler who never can stay in the car where
he belongs while the vestibule if it is hon-
ored with recognition at all is regarded
merely as a convenient opening in which
the bread-line may deploy while awaiting
the signal for the assault on the dining-car
it is only another instance so common in
this hard world in which modest merit goes
unheeded while noisy self-assertiveness gets
all the applause

  when a train gets in trouble it is always
the buffer and the vestibule that stand be-
tween the passengers and harm these two
inventions have saved more lives probably
than all other devices in use on railroads
the buffer and vestibule



 the five coaches were coupled together
by three long links between each two
coaches

  engineer dave matthews was afraid the
clumsy litttle de witt clinton locomotive
couldnt start the train so he opened the
throttle with a jerk that would have caused
the clinton to jump off the rails if it had
not been anchored to that train

   as it was the first coach received a vio-
lent jerk it got even by jerking the next
and so on the whole five pitching forward
with startling suddenness then the
coaches bumped into each other

  this sort of thing continued in a lesser
degree until the first stop was made con-
ductor clark aided by willing volunteers
raided q fence for rails which when lashed
to the coupling-chains held the coaches
apart after a fashion thus the need of
the buffer was first recognized

   for more than thirty-two years after that
historic trip was made passenger - cars
were coupled together with links and pins
this was somewhat better than the original
mohawk and hudson arrangement but it
still left a fearful amount of slack between
the cars so that a railroad journey was an
endless succession of bumps and jerks

  or course the light equipment of early
days was not capable of exerting the tre-
mendous force of a modern steel train but
the difference was only in degree and not
in kind just what railroad travel would
be without the buffer and the vestibule has
been eloquently set forth by the dyna-
mometer like figures the dynamometer
cannot lie unlike figures the dynamometer
never misrepresents

what the dynamometer shows

  the dynamometer then has registered
jerks as high as  pounds in freight-
trains the action of which is absolutely
identical with that of passenger-trains
most of the jerks though were below -

	pounds

  apart from these heavy jerks the dyna-
mometer demonstrated that a train progresses
by a continuous succession of surges due to
the unevenness of the track and curves
these surges are transmitted through the
draft rigging to the whole train usually
they are under  pounds but occa-
sionally they run as high as a hundred thou-
sand pounds

buffing shocks which are the reverse of

the jerks vary from  to more than

	pounds buffing shocks as high
as  pounds have been recorded the
latter however were in the yard not on
the road

  any one with a mind for arithmetic
can figure out for himself exactly how de-
lightful seventy-two hours of continuous
bumps and jerks ranging from  to

	pounds each would be in a jour-
ney on a train without buffers and vesti-
bules from chicago to san francisco no
wonder the passengers of early days
mourned for the good old stage-coach and
would not be comforted

  bumps and jerks were by no means all
the discomfort with which the passenger of
former days had to contend the old link-
and-pin couplings kept the cars so far apart
that in passing from orie to another the
traveler had to make a leap-for life across
a yawning chasm if he didnt drop be-
tween the cars he was likely to be wafted
out over the landscape if he ventured out
on the exposed platform when a high wind
was blowing

   in case of collision the frail platforms
offered no resistance but crumpled like pa-
per the heaviest loss of life on railroads
of early days was due to this cause

millers platform

  this serious defect in passenger-cars was
the subject of a great deal of discussion
but no one could suggest a remedy until
ezra miller secured his first patent on his
platform buffer and coupler in 

  miller was born in bergen county new
jersey in  he was given a technical
education and prepared for the profession
of civil engineer he went to wisconsin in
 where he lived the usual life of a
pioneer until his attention was directed to
the need of better cars he undertook to
find some means to protect the lives of pas-
sengers in case of accident and also to pro-
mote their comfort

  the solution of the problem was the fa-
mous miller platform strength to resist
buffing shocks was given to the platform
and coupler by placing them in line with
the car sills instead of below them as had
been the practise to take up the slack
and so put an end to the bumps and jerks
miller added a buffer to his platform

  it was simply a steel plate with an area
of a little more than a square foot on a


the railroad mans magazine

single stem in the center line of the car
the buffer spring was of one-inch steel five
and a half inches in diameter backed up
by an eight-by-nine-inch timber fastened in
the center platform sills this relieved the
draw-bar spring of considerable stress

first automatic coupler

  the miller platforms fitted together so
closely that one could step from one to an-
other in entire safety in fact it would
have been impossible to fall between them
such success could not have been accom-
plished with the old link-and-pin coupling
of necessity the first automatic coupler was
introduced along with the miller platform

  this was die renowned miller hook
which every old-time railroad man will re-
call with a shudder it cannot be denied
that the miller hook did splendid service
in its day but-

  on a straight track you could generally
couple two cars equipped with miller hooks
without trouble miller hooks have been
known also to uncouple themselves while
the train was running without assistance or
solicitation but when you wanted to cut off
a car at a station or in the yards it was
different

  having spotted your car you seized the
lever and heaved on it next you
placed your feet to better advantage took a
fresh grip on the lever and heaved again
and again and yet again then you sig-
naled the engineer to slack back which lie
did after submitting some unkind remarks
about cornfield sailors who tried to go
railroading

  your partner came and helped heave on
the lever and at length the conductor
sprang up to show how to cut off a car in
the highest style of the art but only suc-
ceeded in getting his hands soiled which
made him grouchy for the rest of the trip
finally a car-repairer came along and
those infernal hooks having wearied of each
others company pulled the lever up with
one hand

  coupling an engine or a car with an ordi-
nary draw-bar on to a miller hook was the
worst you began by prospecting in a foot
of wet cinders  the back of the tank for
a crooked link you never found it until
all the cinders had been plowed over which
required strong finger-nails

  as there was only a little niche in the
face of die hook for the reception of the

link it was impossible to make a coupling
by guiding the link into place instead the
link was placed in the hook and onto it the
ordinary draw-bar was backed

  there was no play for the link in the
hook and a man dared not stand between
the cars where he could guide it properly
for fear the hook would swing out and slip
bv as it did nine times out of ten coup-
ling a miller hook onto an ordinary draw-
bar was like cracking an egg with a steam-
hammer it could be done but it required
a genius to do it and not lose his life

  the miller platform buffer and coupler
were first tried on the chicago and north-
western and the milwaukee and prairie du
chien in september  they were
hailed as the greatest life-saving inventions
of the age

  miller lived to see his inventions adopt-
ed by every railroad in the united states
and in many foreign countries they
earned a princely fortune which he re-
turned to new jersey to enjoy he died
in 

  the miller platform was a long step in
the right direction but it did not go far
enough once given the cue a host of in-
ventors began groping after the vestibule

  the first patent for a vestibule was grant-
ed to charles waterbury june  
twelve years before miller brought out his
platform it was a closed passage between
the rounded ends of cars with doors at the
sides its object was to protect passen-
gers and exclude the dust

  it was tried on the naugatuck railroad
in connecticut but being a flimsy affair
of wood and canvas was discarded as a
failure at the end of two years about the
same time similar affairs were tried in eng-
land and russia with  better success
none of these early vestibules made any
attempt to perform the functions of a buffer

  the next attempt to provide a vestibule
was made by s r calthorp whose patent
was dated august   a year after the
miller platform was brought out cal-
thorps idea was to build a eigar-shaped
train with pointed prow and rounded stern
like a ship the vestibule was there but
the calthorp train looked like a caterpillar
with the dropsy it never received serious
attention

  frederick upham adams patented a ves-
tibuled train on lines somewhat similar to
calthorps twenty years later but the ves-
tibule was merely an incident in his scheme
the buffer and vestibule



to reduce atmospheric resistance it was
tried out by the baltimore and ohio rail-
road but was never adopted by any road

  c s smith among others patented a
vestibule in  smiths vestibule was a
narrow passage with a bellows-like hood
remotely resembling those in use to-day but
with doors in the corners of the cars it
was not given a trial

sessionss vestibule

  at length h h sessions hit upon the
right idea he patented his vestibule april
  then he showed it to george m
pullman the great palace-car builder
bought the patent outright

  immediately the vestibule was made the
pullman standard as soon as possible
a vestibuled train was built and started on
an exhibition tour of triumphal progress
through the principal cities it created a
sensation wherever it went it was then
placed in service on the pennsylvania

 the vestibuled train had not been run-
ning long when it figured in a collision-
running into another train at forty miles
an hour the engine was demolished but
the passengers in the pullmans were un-
harmed

  this spectacular demonstration of the
value of the vestibule as a life-saving device
was all that was needed to create a demand
the wagner palace car company built
vestibuled cars without waiting for the for-
mality of obtaining a license from pullman
there was a great lawsuit which resulted
in a complete victory for the holder of the
sessions patent

   the vestibule as mr sessions first con-
structed it was a narrow passage between
the cars with doors inside the line of the
top step a rubber bellows in a steel frame
with broad steel face-plates kept in contact
by rods and springs bridged the gap be-
tween the wooden passage on the car plat-
forms

   a better buffer was needed than the mil-
ler to make a continuous floor between the
platforms so mr sessions made the first
double-stem buffer the full width of the
passage with broad bearing surface and a
steel apron to cover it and protect the feet
of passengers the face-plates of the ves-
tibules performed the same service as the
buffer by assisting to make a rigid connec-
tion between the cars

  several unsuccessful attempts to im-

prove the buffer were made a g leonard
invented a hydrostatic buffer which con-
sited of two cylinders placed between the
center sills fitted with pistons and a ram
which held the buffer against a spring
there was a hand-pump in the car to keep
the cylinders filled with water

  leonards buffer was tried by the wag-
ner palace car company but was quickly
discarded about the same time f w
webb an englishman got up a similar
contrivance with two cylinders nine inches
in diameter and a two-foot stroke filled
with a mixture of petroleum soap and
water it was tried on the london and
northwestern a german inventor patent-
ed still another hydraulic buffer which was
tried in the fatherland both were failures

solanos face-plate

  r solano patented a face-plate for vesti-
bules to be kept in contact by four pistons
working in air cylinders f a fox of
new york invented a face-plate held in
position by screw and bevel gear j n
barr and others tried various inclined ar-
rangements by which gravity was used to
hold the plates in contact all these schemes
were worthless

  h c buhoup however really did im-
prove the face-plate in some particulars
the gould coupler company made a steel
platform which was very much stronger than
the old wooden platform together with a
two-stem continuous-platform buffer which
made a smooth floor in all positions on
curves or elsewhere

  finally in  the standard coupler
company placed on the market the three-
stem buffer in which the center stem was
free while the end stems were attached to
an equalizer which fully met the require-
ments of up-to-date railroad equipment

  pullman always quick to recognize a good
thing adopted it as the standard for his
palace cars and by august  his lead
had been followed by forty-three railroad
companies the wide vestibule was now
possible so it was adopted and became uni-
versal as soon as cars could be equipped

  in out-of-the-way corners an occasional
narrow-vestibuled sleeper and even a coach
with the old miller platform may still be
found a very few of these relics preserve
the miller hook i wonder where one may
be seen who of the many readers of the

 the desert mail

 by c y w a r m an 

   written for the railroad mans magazine

 your feet have strayed from the
 everglade

 the shore of a shipless sea
 the bar is crossed and at length
 youre lost
 in its hushed immensity

 when you search the wild through the silence piled
 waist-deep for the desert trail

 theres a distant roar like a sea ashore-

 tis the moan of the desert mail

 through the racing years there the engineers
 sit close to the cabin-pane

 as they urge their steeds where the white trail leads
 through the land of little rain

 and out behind on the desert wind

 blown back like a bridal veil

 far dim andgray like the milky way

 lies the dust of the desert mail

 when the gaunt wolves howl where the spirits prowl
 with ghosts of the deserts dead

 and the living lost where their trails have crossed

 mill round while the sun paints red
 the western skies when the long day dies
 and the stars shine dim and pale

 theres a beacon fair on the desert there-

 its the light of the desert mail
building hotels

by andrew chanton

 fifty-two years ago george pullman and a carpenter named leonard
 seibert rebuilt two old passenger - cars belonging to the chicago and
 alton railroad when their work was finished mr pullman proudly
 exhibited to the railroad officials two plush-upholstered sleeping-cars of a dis-
 tinct type each containing ten sections a linen-locker and two wash-rooms
 these were the first pullmans they were put into service on the chicago and
 alton a berth rate of fifty cents a night was charged the brakeman made
 up the beds to-day there are forty-five hundred big comfortable pullmans
 gliding over the rails in this country and  employees are supplying the
 increasing demand

passengers did not wear their boots to bed as was predicted and gladly
paid the price that mr pullman asked to ride in
his  cars

biquitous hotel con-
cern  is the name that
george mortimer pullman
delighted in giving to the
enterprise of which he was
the aladdin  in the des-
ert on the prairie aloft in the mountains
he would say  our traveling inns come
along and pick you up out of the discom-
forts of the waste places and carry you
on surrounded by the luxuries of a great
hotel

  one day mr pullman was traveling in
one of his own sleepers on his way to
visit his branch shops in st louis a
woman passenger entered into conversa-
tion with him not knowing who he was
presently she was regaling him with a re-
cital of the troubles she had in providing
all the knives forks spoons dishes etc
that were necessary in maintaining a fam-
ily hotel that she conducted in st louis

  madam interrupted mr pullman

your woes as a hotel-keeper i appreciate
for i have some slight responsibility in
that line myself i am the principal owner
of ten thousand dozen knives and as many
forks

   i keep on hand over two hundred
thousand spoons i use about one hun-
dred and fifty thousand cups and saucers
every day and i have in service a hun-
dred thousand table-cloths and over half
a million napkins and about a million
towels and-

  land sakes exclaimed the woman
looking at her fellow passenger in blank
amazement you must run a pretty large
boarding-house

  yes maam i do it has a thousand
dining - rooms and three thousand bed-
rooms containing over thirty thousand
beds i employ some five thousand col-
ored servants and have about fifteen thou-
sand white men on my pay-roll seventy-
live million two hundred and fifty thou-


the railroad mans magazine

  i went there walked upto the presi-
dents office and asked to see mr robert
t lincoln the son of abraham lincoln
was out of the city so i was shown into
the office of the vice-president mr charles
s sweet

  mr sweet knows everything about every-
thing pertaining to a business that is as
wide and as long as the continent itself
he is primeminister of the principality of
pullman

  writing about george pullman he
exclaimed why im sure you can de-
scribe no scenes at our shops that will in-
terest a public that cares only for results

   but my story wont be confined to
 sights  i said  theres the human side
i believe i can tell you an anecdote of mr
pullman that even you never heard

  and then i related the anecdote with
which this article opens the story of
which illustrates mr pullmans prac-
tise of keeping on the tip of his tongue
an inventory of the properties of his
 ubiquitous hotel concern

  even before i finished that tale
prime minister sweet indicated drat he
had heard enough he pressed a but-
ton a stenographer entered note-book
in hand  get a pass for one to the
administration building at the works
thats how i came to travel the-four-
teen miles out of chicago to the city of
pullman the capital of the pullman
principality and the greatest car-build-
ing town in the world with a ticket of
admission signed by mr richmond
dean the general manager

  my ticket was addressed to mr
thomas dunbar the manager at the
works who turned me over to a guide
after handing me a crimson card that
 passed  me t ver the whole  making 
plant

  before i had been a quarter of an
hour at the shops i was treated to a
curious experience sideways like a
monstrous crab thats the way the
pullman car traveled in which i was a
passenger thus sidewise it rolled
along the track for an eighth of a mile

  it was a private car brand-new
nearly ready for delivery to one of the
vanderbilts in no respect was it phys-
ically different from any other private
car the twelve wheels were in their
usual places the trucks were in their
proper position

sand pieces of linen are laundered for me
every year and-

   say interjected the woman whose ex-
pression had turned from amazement to
affright  i dont believe youre a board-
ing-house keeper at all i think you run
some sort of an asylum

getting a pass to the plant

  i told this story to the prime minister
of the principality of pullman youll
learn who he is in just a minute

  when you are in their city the chica-
goans will tell you that it is as much your
duty to visit the pullman shops as to go
to the stock-yards the first step you
take then is to go to the big pullman
building on the lake front and get a pass

beheld the conductor and porter
somewhat mixed up
building hotels by the mile



   yet that forty-five-thousand-dollar  flat
on wheels was navigated as a sailor
might say  broadside-on in that car
in company with a pullman official i
lolled on a satin divan

  through the windows on one side i
looked straight to the
front out of windows
on the other side i
looked plumb against
the head end of the
boiler of the locomo-
tive that pushed us
forward sideways a
whole furlong

  that car made its
extraordinary journey
along a kind of alley
between the great
shops in the shops
there are some ten
miles of track on
these tracks any day
you can see seven
thousand workmen
building a hundred or
more railroad cars as
each car nears com-
pletion it is either
moved to another of
the many different
shops or is taken out into the yard to be
turned over to the  finishers-

  well our private car was being moved
out into the yard first it was rolled out
of the shop and onto a platform that trav-
eled along a track more than seventy feet
wide down the alley between the giant
buildings the platform looked like a
turn-table only it didnt turn

sixty miles of hotels on wheels

  it was pushed along sidewise with our
car as its load till it reached a certain
yard-track where the car moved in its
natural  head-on  way by being pulled
off the platform by a switching-engine

   such is one of the  sights  at the place
where they build traveling hotels by the
mile on the rails of north america there
are to-day over sixty miles of such hotels
on wheels in other words there is a
fleet of forty - five hundred pullman
sleepers parlor-cars and diners on the
road

  last year alone the pullman shops
turned out over twelve miles of itinerant

hotels or about one thousand passenger-
cars of all classes and our private car
that traveled sideways represented a paltry
sixty feet of the fifteen miles of traveling
bedrooms dining - rooms drawing - rooms
and sitting-rooms coaches that will
be built during the
present year at the
capital city of the
principality of pull-
man

  the capacity of the
shops is one sleeper
two coaches and fifty
box cars a day  we
can and pretty nearly
do turn out in a year
over sixteen thousand
cars of all kinds said
a pullman worker
 hitch all those cars
of a single year in one
train and the front
car would stand in
new york and the
rear car would be in
baltimore making a
train one hundred and
eighty miles long
the value of all
pullman and private
cars in the country to-day is one hundred
and twenty-five million dollars that is
more than one-half the total value of all
the telegraph systems of the country and
a quarter of the value of all the mining
products

  in the passenger-car shops the racket
was so deafening that i could only pretend

i	heard what my guide was telling me
it was the noise of a thousand hammers
and mallets on wood

  the hammerers were driving nails at
the rate of about two thousand a minute
and in making the sides of cars they
pounded thoroughly seasoned hardwood
into place at the rate of a hundred planks
a minute-planks taken -from the two mil-
lion dollars worth of lumber that is car-
ried in stock

  amid the banging and the general din
however my pilot managed at last to make
me understand that in the pullman shops
sixty million feet of lumber were used last
year if delivered at one time as we after-
ward figured that yearly lumber supply
would require a train fifty miles long con-
sisting of five thousand cars

enough to build six sky-scrapers in
new york city


the railroad mans magazine

  with that lumber you could build a
board-walk eight planks wide the whole
length of the atlantic coast of the united
states lay the walk one plank wide and
it would be twelve thousand miles long
running down the coasts of the three amer-
icas from labrador to some point near pata-
gonia	

supplies and materials

  when you think of all that lumber and
all the wood-workers required to convert it
into railroad cars you accept as a matter
of course the information that george pull-
mans father was a carpenter that george
started life as a carpenters apprentice and
that he afterward learned the trade of cabi-
net-maker

   a trifle of other materials too is used
in the pullman shops in a year they con-
sume one hundred and twenty-five thou-
sand tons of iron enough to build six
sky-scrapers in new york city or chicago
delivered all at one time that iron would
arrive on a train sixty miles long com-
posed of six thousand cars

  there are also a few machines in those
car-building sheds fifteen hundred and
some they are operated by thirty station-
ary engines having a total of twelve thou-
sand horse-power

  the biggest of the engines is the giant
corliss that made its debut at the centen-
nial exposition at philadelphia thirty-one
years ago with it are connected nineteen
and one-half miles of shafting and belting

   the coal used in keeping those thirty en-
gines in action during one year  tons
would warm at least six thousand ordinary
houses for a whole winter

the wreck test

  queer stunts other than that of ma-
king cars run sideways are performed at
the shops one day a year or so ago on the
pullman railroad that is operated in con-
nection with the plant there was a wreck-
not one of your accidental affairs but one
deliberately planned and executed to order

  down the tracks came a train consisting
of a parlor-car and an engine the engine
was pushing the car and making directly
for a lone sleeper a new one that stood on
the same track - as the backing train
neared the sleeper it gathered a speed of
thirty miles an hour

one could see that the engineer did not

even try to avert a collision did he mean
thus wantonly to wreck his own train
did he intend maliciously to destroy rail-
road property worth a small fortune  yes
thats exactly what he meant to do-if he
could

   crash bong went the flying train into
the solitary sleeper and when the pull-
man workers looked the  wreck  over this
is what they found tender of engine fit
only for the scrap-heap vestibules of par-
lor-car reduced to kindling and junk sleep-
er absolutely intact unhurt unscathed

  what was all the fuss about it was
just a wreck test both cars were pullman-
made but the parlor-car was the regulation
wooden affair while the sleeper was a type
of car youve never seen-unless you have
visited the jamestown exposition where
that car-the jamestown-was placed
on exhibition soon after the wreck test at
pullman

   the  wreck  took place a few days be-
fore i presented my pass at the pullman
works wheres that car now i asked
and learned that it stood at the grand cen-
tral station in chicago at that station i
boarded the first sleeping-car of its kind on
earth-an  all-steel  car

first all-steel car

   it was designed by one who is to-day the
proudest member of the general staff of the
pullman army max schneider on the
inside of the car i looked in vain for wood
its bones so to speak were all of steel

   its walls were nine parts steel and one
part asbestos its floor was two parts steel
and one part concrete its roof was steel
but its inner ceiling was aluminum and
its window-frames were of brass

  pour burning oil on that car and you
would damage only the carpets and up-
holstery try to wreck it while its -wheels
turn at the rate of thirty miles an hour and
as ive shown nothing doing happens-
except to the other car or engine

   after leaving the shops i walked around
the town two or three of the twenty-five
hundred householders invited me to step in-
side to inspect he model nests of brick that
mr pullman built  to help my employees
to help themselves

  one man said he had occupied the same 
house for nearly a quarter of a century
then i visited the pullman club looked in
at the theater and stopped at the library
building hotels by the mile



where ten thousand volumes are at the free
disposal of anybody

  this model city is now thirty-one years
old it covers thirty-five hundred acres or
about six square miles its shape and size
resemble that of central park in new york
two miles long and half a
mile wide you can ride
for twelve hours over paved
streets a hundred feet wide
stroll sixteen miles on side-
walks and go seafaring on
three miles of calumet lake

  the inhabitants of this
very distinctive manufac-
turing and railroad town
number fifteen thousand a
population equal to that of
ann arbor michigan twice
that of annapolis -mary-
land or three times that of
boise idaho

  to the workmen in pull-
man alone the company has
paid since the town was
founded over seventy-five
million dollars

  the seven thousand five
hundred workers of the town
comprise one-tliird of all
pullman employees in the
country that makes the
grand total twenty-one thou-
sand with an annual pay-roll
of thirteen million dollars

  one day mr pullman was
crossing the arizona desert
on the southern pacific in a
car named psychrus at one
of the water-tank stations he
got out to stretch his legs
wandering a little way from
the tank when he returned
he said to a porter

   how far back is my car 

its the-ahem-the circus 

   oh you mean the pish-rush cried the
porter  second car back

  another time he was traveling on a union
pacific train going west the cars on that
train were mostly of the  r  class-rham-
nenses rhodanus rhyndacus now as
mr pullman passed through the train he
chanced upon a pullman conductor who
was studying a greek testament

  putting your spare time to good use i
see remarked mr pullman

  yes sir im a theological-student

   young man mr pullman said with
impressive solemnity  if youre a theolog-
ical student im astonished that youd resort
to prevarication in any form for its my
belief that in studying that book you are
merely mastering the nomenclature of the no-

bravely he attempted to
open a window

ble profession theuni form of which adorns
you at this moment

  in talking of private cars the visiting
railroaders at the hotel florence said that
certain private-car owners have of late de-
clared that the privacy thus attained does
not offset the additional dangers incurred
your private car is always at the rear end 
of a train

  when the train is long and is running at
high speed you are whirled around curves
in a way that makes you feel like the end


the railroad mans magazine

boy in the game of
snap-the-whip also
there has been in re-
cent months an epi-
demic of rear-end col-
lisions for these two
and sufficient reasons
mr george vander-
bilt recently sold his
private car and now
rides as mr pullman
frequently did in an
ordinary sleeper

 one of my ac-
quaintances at the ho-
tel related a specific
incident suggestive of
from labrador to other dangers of pri-
patagonia	vate - car travel a

                   montana mine-owner
on his way east in his own car reached st
paul there a switching-engine transferred
his car from the road he came on to a chi-
cago foad

  the chicago train immediately pulled
out no notice of the  private  had been
given to the conductor hence no rear
lamps were put in position nor were the
steam and air-brake connections attended to

  on the bridge over the mississippi the
mine-owner suddenly found his car stand-
ing still he was at dinner into the
dining-room rushed the cook to announce
that the car was standing on the track in the
middle of the bridge and that the rest of
the train had vanished

  the man from montana sprang to the
door and instantly realized his danger the
coupling had broken a train coming from
either direction would hurl his car into the
river

  he jumped off and hurried back over the
bridge momentarily expecting to fall
through the ties to a watery grave he
found a station and the telegraph operator
did the rest stations to the rear were noti-
fied to hold up trains and a station ahead
was wired to stop the chicago train and
send it back to pick up its lost car but
that montana miner never afterward felt
quite happy in his luxurious and exclusive
traveling fiat

his christian name

  tales are told by the dozen by the rank
and file at the arcade one  arcadian 
said  heres one that isnt twenty-four

hours old its about a pullman porter
well known in this town who got square
with a passenger that incessantly and
haughtily ordered and never tipped

     see here george cried the passenger
 bring me-

  thats me yah ahm george but
ah didnt spose you knew me well enough
to use mah christian name gemmen calls
me just  po-tah glad sah to count you
as mah pussonal frien

   and now the  arcadian  said  i
aint going to tell you georges other name
because if you printed his full name hed
get fired discipline in the united states
army is childs play compared to what it is
in the army of pullman

  and say did you know that mr pull-
man had a head shaped like a railroad
car well he did phrenologists called
it his  long head it just shows how a
mans business can affect the outline of
his cranium

   look at the  old mans  hat thats been
lying around the hotel yonder ever since the
creator of this vast business was laid in his
specially invented dynamite-proof grave be-
neath several tons of concrete and steel and
youll see that im telling you gospel

  the rarest thing in the pullman army is
dishonesty i refer principally to the por-
ters the men who are frequently tempted
but who seldom fall a man gets off a
train early in the morning leaving a plump
pocketbook or a valuable watch under his
pillow

temptations of a porter

  his wife leaves her diamond-rings lying
on the wash-basin in their stateroom that
money those jewels are found by the porter
who hands them over to the conductor as he
would do if the articles were an umbrella
and a book

  after much questioning of members of
the pullman army at pullman town i at
last heard of one porter who was sorely
tempted and fell he fell literally too
with a dull thud

  the story of that porters sudden back-
sliding is so exceptional in the annals of
pullman that i set it down here as a vari-
ation of the monotone of integrity

   it was a train on the northwestern bound
from omaha to chicago one of the pas-
sengers in the sleeper was a mining man
from goldfield nevada in a satchel he
carried fortv thousand dollars worth of
building hotels by the mile



goldfield municipal bonds which he in-
tended to  peddle  in chicago

  in a moment of confidence the nevada
man communicated his secret to the porter

  that bag of mine he said looks
like it might hold socks and a collar well
it contains the price of about eighty thou-
sand pairs of socks and of about a third of
a million collars and then he named
the contents as  forty one-thousand-dollar
bonds

  not many minutes later he looked for his
bag and failed to see it just as his dis-
may began taking the more active form of
wrath he heard sounds of a scuffle in
the rear door of his car he beheld the pull-
man conductor and the porter somewhat
mixed up as to legs and arms

he saved the bag

  as the man from nevada rushed down
the aisle with intent to ally himself with
the conductor his bag fell to the floor of
the vestibule he seized it and simul-
taneously the porter vanished

  did that porter fall off or did he
jump off perhaps doubt on this point can
be dispersed by the sheriff of a certain coun-
ty in iowa providing he found the porter
lying on the northwestern right-of-way as
he expected

  when the report of this incident reached
the town of pullman the car-builders were
dumfounded a porter gone wrong in-
credible it was only a practical joke-
perpetrated by the mining man his bag
really contained only socks and-a collar
such was pullman-town sentiment the
only part of the report that pleased the
pullmanites was a remark of the philosophic
traveler who referred to that willing but
unlucky porter

  wonder if you ever heard of a pull-
man conductor called beehive brady
said one of the  arcadians  no well
he aint in the service now dont know
whats become of him but i recollect hear-
ing him tell how he came to be known as
 beehive  brad-

wouldnt part wilh his insects

  he once had the chicago-st paul run
at a way-station a man with a flowing white
beard boarded one of bradys sleepers
the old gent carried a wooden box about
the size of the canary-bird cages you see in

stores when brady collected the passen-
gers ticket he heard a peculiar buzzing
sound coming from that box

    passengers aint allowed to carry noth-
in alive in these cars he said

    these are harmless creatures the pas-
senger replied  theyre a rare species of
insect theyre in a patent trap cant get
out a man of your superior intelligence
conductor will appreciate my position and
privileges when i tell you im an ento-
mologist

  that word put the quietus on brady
he couldnt enforce rules on a man that
called himself a thing like that perhaps
entomologists were entitled to privileges he
had never heard of anyway he decided
to leave whiskers alone till the train-con-
ductor could be consulted as to the rules for
entomologists

   brady was about two cars farther back
still collecting tickets when in dashed an
old lady with horror written in her pallid
face  conductor  she cried  its sim-
ply disgraceful ill report you that car
im in is full of bees 	-

   a great light flooded bradys brain
at last he knew what an entomologist was-
knew all about it without having to display
his ignorance by asking the train-conductor
an entomologist was a dealer in honey

   harmless insects rare species bra-
dy was furious at the thought no ento-

mologist he swore would ever
again carry his honey-making
plant into a brady-conducted
pullman you bet

   forward brady flew to the	ft

car that a few minutes before
had contained whiskers and  
half a dozen innocent passen-	

gers brady now found the i
car empty of human beings 
whiskers himself had flown 
hot on the heels of the others

and so had the  harmless  sleeper-

  m  	 coaches

insects i hey had managed  bx cars
to escape from their patent daily


the railroad mans magazine

hive and the car was fairly alive with
them

    as brady entered he heard a noise like
that of a hundred electric buzzers-and
also he was stung on the nose yet he
bravely attempted to open a window-only
to be stung on the ear even in the hasty
flight he then achieved leaving the door
open so that the enemy could escape he
was stung on the chin

   in a towering rage and maddened by
pain he reached the smoking-car where
whiskers had taken refuge

   what do you mean by bringing bee-
hives into my cars  howled brady
 didnt i tell you that live things werent
permitted confound you why didnt
you say you were the kind of entomologist
that has beehives 

  never you mind conductor said
whiskers  im not strictly speaking an
entomologist its true i dabble in the
genus entomophagous and am somewhat
versed in entomotaxy but my proclivities
are chiefly apiarian and thats how i came
to invent that new beehive that i now see
needs a little improvement as to means of
egress in short conductor im an api-
arist

     oh is that what you are  murmured
brady as meekly as an immigrant traveler
that doesnt understand english  well if
thats what you are he added  why then
of course perhaps i guess i ought to allow
you the usual privileges

hard on the railroads

  still other soldiers of the pullman
army spoke of how proud mr pullman
was of chicago and especially of the part
the railways were playing in the citys de-
velopment to a united states senator
from illinois mr pullman once said
yes sir we have over a thousand trains
a day running in and out of our city with
over a hundred and fifty thousand passen-
gers and the fact is the railways have
made chicago just what it is to-day
goodness gracious cried the senator
what a horrible charge to bring against
the railways

   one car-builder told me that chicago did
not raise the man pullman  pullman
raised chicago he insisted

  it seems that in the- days when the city
was lifted bodily out of a marsh mr
pullman was one of the first to secure a

contract to move a block of buildings he
was then in his early manhood his father
had given him certain patented devices for
raising buildings without disturbing street
traffic and without injuring the-structures

  george heard that men were wanted to
 raise  chicago he called on owners of
business property in the heart of the city
displayed his new appliances and secured
a contract to raise a hotel and  fill in

  his success was so complete that other
contracts came to him and by the time that
a good part of the central district of chi-
cago stood on dry land with the marsh
smothered beneath the fill in pullman
had cleared about twenty thousand dollars

  and that was the way young pullman got
the money to begin the construction of the
first comfortable sleeping-car in the world
he paid five thousand dollars for a patent
or two and spent the remainder of his little
capital in building in  the now fa-
mous pioneer that car cost altogether
eighteen thousand dollars or over four times
as much as any  alleged  sleeping-car then
in existence

pioneer sleeping-car

  even as early as s an extremely
primitive sleeping-car had been put in oper-
ation between chambersburg and harris-
burg for the accommodation of travelers to
the pennsylvania state capital the berths
were remodeled from those of steamboats

  by s the new york central had
sleepers with berths three deep on each
side and with practically no bedclothes or
pillows the mattresses were stored at the
end of the car and were dragged along
the none too clean floor to the berths as
wanted

  the car was lighted by candles or sperm-
oil lamps those who wanted to wash did
so in a tin basin

  in  mr pullman made a night jour-
ney from buffalo to westfield over the new
york central

    it was a sixty-mile ride said mr pull-
man afterward  and i occupied a bunk in
one of the so-called sleeping-cars the rat-
tling and bumping and jolting kept me
awake the whole way i put the time to
good use however by revolving in my mind
plans by which i could build a car with a
dormitory which would provide more com-
fort than the car i was riding in by the
time i reached westfield i was convinced
building hotels by the mile



that i could build a car in which passengers
could really getsome sleep

  the railroad that gave mr pullman his
start in the sleeping-car business was the
chicago and alton but which particular
official of that road made the first  bar-
gain with the young inventor it was the
superintendent colonel r e goodell of
denver

building the first pullmans

  it was in  says mr goodell
 three different companies were making
crude  bedroom cars i was about to make

he jumped and hurried back
over the bridge

a contract with one of them to supply the
alton with  bedrooms when mr pullman
then about twenty-eight years old came to
see me

   he impressed me so strongly with his
earnestness that i decided to give him a
chance the road made a contract with
him to remodel two old passenger-cars mr
pullman took those cars to our shops at
bloomington where the insides were re-
moved and refitted according to his orders
and those were the first pullman cars

   later when mr pullman became a na-

the railroad mans magazine

tional character and a millionaire i saw
him frequently much of his business was
clone while traveling presidents and super-
intendents of roads would come to his car
and in half an hours conversation arrange
the details of business for perhaps a whole
year he never grew enthusiastic over any-
thing and i never saw him excited
colonel goodell always carried a pass
good on every car belonging to the pullman
company either in america or europe

   i have helped many men he once said
 and george pullman was one of the few
who remembered this pass of mine was
mailed ever year so that it came to me on
new years morning

  it was after mr pullmans experiments
on the alton that lie built the pioneer

   he rented a workshop and employed
skilled mechanics says a pullman official
 and though mr pullman was himself
without mechanical training he personally
directed the work of others in all the minute
details of putting his ideas into material
form in the  pioneer  and in the still more
expensive cars that immediately followed

  would wear their boots to bed

   but such extravagance in a mere rail-
road car is ridiculous protested president
joy of the michigan central addressing
mr pullman people will climb in be-
tween the sheets of your sleeping-car with
their boots on and they will view the car-
pets and upholstery in the light of a con-
venient cuspidor

  not at all replied the optimistic in-
ventor  the same instinct which makes
people conform in their habits to elegant
surroundings in a first-class hotel will make
them conform to the appointments of my
hotel on wheels

  the result of this conversation was that
president joy said  well well run a few

  of your twenty-four-thousand-dollar-ears on
the michigan central just for the experi-
ment but im sure the public will never
pay two dollars for a bunk

  to the florence hotel-named for mr
pullmans daughter-come many railroad
officers who once had personal dealings with
mr pullman they are unanimous in de-
claring that the famous car-builder had
the infinite capacity for details that spells
genius his talent for organization is ap-
parent to-day to even the casual visitor to
the works though the genius of the estab-
lishment died ten years ago

keeping track of the cars

  in the administration building for in-
stance i found that they can turn to the
record of any given car no matter in what
part of north america it may be running at
the time and tell to a penny what it cost
originally how much it is earning per month
or per day what its expenses are for oper-
ation and repairs how many passengers it
has carried altogether since it was built how
many passengers occupied it at any par-
ticular time and the names of the conductor
and porter in charge of it on any specified
day or run in short in the home office
one can find the whole life history of any
pullman car

  after my visit to the noisy passenger-
car shops already described i went through
the wood machine-shops the cabinet-shops
the marquetry department the brass foun-
dry-and everywhere there was the same
bedlam pandemonium reigned throughout
that plant as on a battle-field

  men everywhere were driving nails in
battalions the sound effect was of volley
upon volley of musketry loads of lumber
slid from cars to ground with a booming
sound like cannon to right and left in
action

          by chester porter bissell

          he sent the chills down adamss back
          and then adams returned the compliment

o  had just gone the few
passengers who had alighted
 shambled along the board-
walk to the business part of
the town sam adams the
station - agent pushed the
truck back into the freight-room checked the
packages with the way-bills and finding
they were ok he closed the freight-room
door with a bang picking up three or four
sacks of mail he trudged toward the post-
office

  sam had been agent at capeville for the
c h and w for fifteen years it seemed
to him that he had worked at the red depot
all his life other men had been pro-
moted and went to better paying positions
leaving sam plodding in the same rut

  sam had married mary grisham the
daughter of a prosperous farmer about fif-
teen years before sam was then beginning
his career as a telegraph operator and mary
saw no reason why he should not climb the
ladder rung by rung until he reached the
pinnacle-the presidency of the road

  alas in spite of sams faithful service
and ability he remained at capeville for
fifteen years and mary accepted his failure
with fortitude although she could not un-
derstand why other men went ahead of sam

  as she struggled to keep up the house
and feed clothe and send six growing chil-
dren to school on sams fifty dollars a
month tears of disappointment came to her
eyes many times

  as sam walked to the post-office with the
maij he seemed to be in a trance at any
rate he was in an unhappy frame of mind

he had long contemplated a lay-off now
that their home was out of debt he could
afford to take a short breathing spell

 r r	

   only mary and he knew the personal
 sacrifices and grinding economies that had
 enabled them to secure a home he would
 have been put to shame if it would have
 been proclaimed to the world how far he
 had learned to make a nickel go and how
 many darns and stitches mary took to make
 the little stockings and pinafores hang to-
 gether

   sam asked himself if he could afford a
 vacation to do nothing-absolutely noth-
 ing for a few weeks what a novelty

   but something seemed to step in and say
 no not yet

   one day a car arrived containing the out-
 fit of a number of immigrants its destina-
 tion had been changed while in transit
 sam collected the freight charges as orig-
 inally billed not noticing the changed head-
 ing of the way-bill therefore he did not
 collect the full amount from the consignee
 furthermore he never could-the consignee
 was dead

   sam in due time received a letter from
 the auditing department instructing him to
  take special debit for  account under-
 charge on car of emigrant outfit account
 duluth way-bill 

   the writer of the letter was somewhat
 caustic he asked sam if he ever revised
 his way-bills and called his attention to
 amendment -b to supplement -g to
 tariff -cc also in connection with
 c h and ws proportion-sheet -f para-
 graph  for the correct rate

   when sam read this letter he was real
 mad it meant another month or more be-
 fore he could take his vacation

   he entered the post-office and threw the
 mail on the floor with a sigh of relief
 brushing the dirt from his worn clothing


the railroad mans magazine

he peeped into his box and took out a
postal-card it was a western union tele-
graph companys error-card amounting to
ninety-three cents

  great scott sam ejaculated is
there no end to this paying money out
the company wants a fellow to work for
next to nothing then pay it all back inwhat
they call errors hang the railroad com-
pany  

  with bitterness in his heart sam re-
turned to the depot

  he entered the waiting-room drew the
keys from his pocket and was preparing
to unlock the office-door when he noticed
a well-dressed man at the ticket window
sam noticed particularly that the stranger
carried an expensive gripsack as sam en-
tered the office the stranger picked up his
grip and followed him in

   i suppose you are the express - agent
here he asked politely

  yes sir what can i do for you an-
swered sam eying the stranger closely he
was about thirty-five years of age well
built clean cut and polished in manner
but he had a queer unblinking stare

   i am here to check your express ac-
counts my name is jones-j harry
jones here is my authority he handed
sam a letter

  sam had always held traveling auditors
in a sort of fear his accounts were always
in tip-top shape and-frequently the auditors
had commended his neat bookkeeping and
his small clear-cut figures in the impression
books

  but this man jones there could be no
doubt as to the authenticity of the letter it
was written on the superintendents letter-
head and carried his signature sam had
seen this signature so many times

  in a bewildered manner sam read the
instructions giving all agents orders to al-
low j harry jones to audit the station
accounts

  the typewritten words seemed to run to-
gether in a blur a vague feeling stole over
him that for some unknown reason his
bonding company might have terminated
his bond-that this man had come to check
him out

  why mr patterson the route-agent
was here last week said sam nervously

   thats all right dont feel uneasy in
the least replied the auditor reassuringly

  sam felt as if a weight had been removed
from his heart he put out his hand and

the auditor shook it warmly sam appeared
to be very happy

  you see continued the auditor
 route-agent patterson misplaced the re-
port on your check and was not able to lo-
cate it as he is very busy i was sent here
to get another check his voice had a
soothing effect

  now the first thing is your cash he
added opening his grip sam went to the
 cast-iron  safe took out a roll of bills
which he handed to the auditor

   i intended to remit yesterday but did
not get to it i am afraid i have more
money on hand than is allowed by the
rules said sam growing slightly nervous
again

   thats all right agents cannot always
live up to the stringent rules the company
makes the auditor answered smiling

  sam stared in astonishment here was
an official who was not harping on the rules
on the contrary he was taking sides with
sam a feeling of good fellowship began
to steal over him

  do you wish me to remit asked sam
getting a remittance slip and a money en-
velope from the case

  oh no i will just take it along with
me here is your receipt two hundred
and fifty-four dollars now get me your
express books said the auditor with a
gleam of satisfaction as he placed the roll
of bills in the grip

  sam got his  delivery  forwarding
the  old hoss  book and the impression
book that contained copies of his monthly
reports and laid them before the auditor
in a few minutes he was totally absorbed
in checking abstracts statements and mon-
ev-order reports

  sam went to the telegraph table in the
window sat down on the inverted end of
the nail keg which served him as a waste
basket and gave the despatcher the  os 
of no 

  as he sat by the telegraph instrument he
thought of the mail he received on no 
he drew the express way-bills and three or
four letters from his coat-pocket he
opened one it was a requisition for two
gallons of coal oil and a half-dozen lamp-
wicks returned from the superintendents
office with a note on it asking sam what
he had done with the oil and wicks which
had been sent him a month previous sam
laughed and laid a track - spike on the
requisition
j harry jones auditor



    its that little pinheaded chief clerk that
asks such idiotic questions he said to
himself

   he picked up another envelope it con-
tained a bunch of tariffs from the traffic
bureau vivid recollections of the thirty-
one dollars came to him as he glanced at
them with a feeling of disgust he threw
them aside

   sam opened another letter this one was
a circular letter from the express company
 one thousand dollars reward  was the
heading it gave in detail the bertillon
measurements and the description of a noted
international swindler who had served sev-
eral terms in jail and had many aliases

   he was about to throw it to one side
agents generally give such things only pass-
ing interest but-he chanced to look on
the opposite side of the circular

   he paled and his body seemed to become
suddenly paralyzed little chills began to
run up and down his back his hand
trembled with excitement

   before him was a photographic likeness
of the crook wanted it was an excellent
picture of the auditor sitting behind him

   sam quickly regained his composure and
began to think just what action to take
here was a serious problem to be solved
quickly and by himself then also two
hundred and fifty-four dollars were in-
volved for which he would be held respon-
sible the very thought of losing such an
amount made him shudder

   there was another risk to run he might
be mistaken such coincidences had hap-
pened he pulled out his watch the pic-
ture of mary on the inside of the case
looked at sam with a soft tender gaze a
white flame of passion shot through him
charging his body with courage he would
arrest this man if he made a mistake he
would take the consequences

   he would uke the risk

  the auditor worked on unconcernedly

 he was so like an  old head  that sam
was uneasy now and then he vould ask
sam a question that showed he was  dead
next to the job this only made the situ-
ation more perplexing

  twenty miles from capeville was the
town of cooper-the division for the rail-
road company the office of superintend-
ent of the express company was located
there

   sam heard the go wire working with
cooper he knew the operator at cooper

-old  kn sam opened the key and
got busy

   say  kn could you get off about
fifteen minutes i want you to step over
to moores office-the express superintend-
ent sam sent over the wire

   i guess so what is it you want old
man responded kn

  sam sent a hurried statement to be for-
warded to the superintendent-that the pic-
ture  the circular and the face of the
auditor were alike as two peas

  ask them if they sent any one here to
check this office and let me know what to
do quick continued sam

  his fingers trembled on the key as a
flash came to him that the auditor might
be an operator

   you stay right there a minute old man
i will phone and let you know said  kn
leaving his key open

  if the auditor was an operator he never
let on he was still deeply absorbed in his
work

   when does the next train go east  
asked the auditor

   in just two hours one goes west in
about an hour sam answered without turn-
ing his head

   i will take the one going east added
the auditor

  the auditor would not take the east-bound
train if sam could prevent him the in-
strument called sam sharply

   say old man there is something doing
you have stirred up a hornets nest the
superintendent is here and says for you
to watch this man and he will be down
with two officers on no  in about an
hour said kn

  after answering a volley of questions
sam closed his key the operator at  go 
resumed business with cooper and sam in
an unconcerned manner turned around and
walked into the freight-room

  as he looked through the freight-room
door he saw the sheriff goingby sam
hailed him with more than customary fervor

  in another minute the sheriff knew the
situation sam showed him the photograph
on the circular and told him that the offi-
cers were coming on no 

   there is a thousand dollars reward
sam i might as well get that as the
pinkertons lets arrest him now said
the sheriff

  there was only one tiling on sams mind
-the two hundred and fifty-four dollars


the railroad mans magazine

he might lose if the auditor got away
sam was agreeable to nabbing him at once

  all right i am game replied sam
putting the circular in his pocket

  return to your office and i will be in
soon and ask for something leave the
door open and keep cool said the sheriff

  sam returned to his office the auditor
had just finished the books he threw them
in a pile on the table leaned back in his
chair lit a cigar and gave a long sigh of
relief and placed his feet on the books

  well i am through everything is
ok he said drawing long puffs and
closing his eyes

   thanks replied sam his anger be-
gen to get the best of him as he thought of
the cool manner in which this man was
trying to dupe him then his heart jumped
the sheriff was coming through the waiting-
room into the office

  hallo sam see if you have an ex-
press package for me asked the sh iff
casting a side glance at the auditor

   ill see replied sam going to the
table where the auditor sat

   i will have to trouble you for my de-
liverv-book sam said to the man

    sure replied the auditor

  as he leaned back and lifted his legs
from the books sam grabbed both of them
and turned him over backward smashing
the chair and overturning the table

   sam fell on top of the auditor a pistol-
shot rang through the office just as no 
whistled for capeville sam managed to
knock the revolver from the auditors hand
just as he was going to fire the second time

   then a desperate hand-to-hand scuffle en-
sued but the combined efforts of sam and
the sheriff rendered the auditor helpless
the blood trickled from sams cheek and
he began to feel somewhat faint no 
rolled in with the superintendent and two
detectives

   got him have you   asked the super-
intendent as he scrutinized the auditors
face  thats him go through him and
see if he has any more shootin-irons

  a pair of handcuffs were snapped on him

  whats the meaning of this he de-
manded choking with rage

   this is the meaning replied sam
showing him his own picture on the circular

  j harry jones resolved himself into a
deep study

  the next morning sam stopped to read
the following letter which he had received
on no  from the express company

  mr samuel adams

  dear sir i find that j harry jones the
  fake auditor has swindled nearly every agent
  on my division with his photo right in front
  of them i have communicated with the gen-
  eral manager and he authorizes me to pay you
  the reward of one thousand-dollars enclosed
  find draft covering same acknowledge re-
  ceipt

              a h moore superintendent

  with a pale face sam gazed at the draft
then he thought of his bright smiling
mary with a feeling of joy the sudden
burst of prosperity seemed more than he
could stand

  sam put the draft in his pocket and
jumping to his feet let loose a few blood-
curdling war-whoops he picked up the
chair that had been shattered in the scrim-
mage with j harry jones and hurled it
across the office he threw the coal-hod
through the ticket-window followed closely
by the fire-shovel he played foot-ball
with his waste-basket-the nail-keg-and
finally broke into a whirling dance

  sam adams who had maintained the
dignity of the c h and w railroad com-
pany at capeville for the past fifteen years
was celebrating

   hey sam what on earth are you doing
why dont you bring that mail to the post-
office people have been waiting for an
hour if i had not known you for the
past twenty years i would swear you was
drunk  cried the postmaster through the
ticket-window

   by gosh i clear forgot that mail 
answered sam as he grabbed the sacks and
fairly flew up the board-walk to the post-
office door

  and then he ran home to tell mary

a cold boiler will never burst-neither will it haul freight let
     enough enthusiasm into your life to make steam

                        author of in the hornets nest

           fulward of the snowball trust company
           develops a scheme that gets him in bad

chapter i
the sum of 

afternoon at about ten
minutes past the hour of
five a well-dressed man
mw aged forty-five his steel-
 gray hair sharply cut
features and piercing
brown eyes denoting the clever business ex-
pert walked briskly down broadway new
york in the direction of the snowball trust
company

  that is not the correct name of the finan-
cial institution toward which the steps of
mr oxenham fulward were directed but
as this narrative is based more or less on
things that have made history the author
begs for obvious reasons that the real
names of the people and places and things
connected with it be sufficiently changed to
preclude the possibility of embarrassment

  tlic story however is just as it was told
to me by several of the parties connected
with the remarkable affair

  mr oxenham fulward was walking in
the direction of the snowball trust com-
pany he was the assistant cashier of that
company he had left his offices in the
ground floor of the imposing sky-scraper
which it occupied at precisely three oclock

  at that time the officers usually took
their departure for the daily routine of the
bank official begins at ten in the morning
and ends at three in the afternoon although
the clerks and their superiors are obliged to
stay until five in order that the business of
the day may be checked up and recorded

fulward was timing himself to arrive at

the offices of the snowball at fifteen min-
utes after five by that time the clerks
who were not permitted to leave their desks
until five sharp would have put on their
hats and coats and become part of the great
stream of toiling humanity which at that
hour files homeward through the canons
that lead from the financial district of the
metropolis to the entrances of the elevated
and subway trains and the concourse of
brooklyn bridge

  fulward had a key that unlocked the
front door this he deemed necessary for
his visits to the bank after hours were of
more or less frequency patrick carr the
worthy citizen who guarded the place when
it was closed to give the alarm should
thieves break in and steal was absolutely
unconcerned regarding the unusual visit of
so prominent an officer of the concern

  when fulward entered and nodded
cheerfully to the watchman who with a
bunch of evening papers and an easy chair
was preparing to make himself comfortable
for the night patrick merely returned the
salutation and went his way

   them bankers do not have so easy a
time as one would think said patrick to
himself as the assistant cashier entered his
private office mr fulward is obliged to
come back here most every night and work
until tis very late thank heaven i can
take it easy

  patrick was entitled to the promptings of
his soliloquy-but mr fulward did not
have to return to the office for any such
reason he returned because it was to his
particular advantage to do so

  in a shorter and uglier phrase he re-
turned to doctor his books


the railroad mans magazine

  mr fulward for some five years or
more had been systematically robbing the
snowball trust company

  his peculations had now run up to a
sum that was slightly over one hundred
thousand dollars his-system was as old
as the eternal hills men had tried to beat
it before and had gone down to ruin

  ful ward began to rob when he read of an
apprehended cashier-who had kept this par-
ticular scheme in successful operation for
ten years that was the first tip that he
had that bank robbery was so very easy and
he resolved to put it to the test his first
haul was a thousand dollars it came so
easy that he took another thousand and then
another and still another finally it had
become a habit

  the ancient scheme was to intercept the
collections for the day take whatever sum
he needed and alter the collection-clerks
sheet

  the next morning the bookkeeper who
entered on his journal the collections of the
preceding day was none the wiser as ful-
ward had direct charge of this part of the
companys business it was easy for him to
operate and conceal his peculations

  they now covered a period of five years
during that time he had read of other
cashiers who had gone down to disgrace
through similar methods he had read of
suicides and families made miserable of
institutions being wrecked and the wreckers
sent to jail of wives who suffered the tor-
tures of degradation through their miscreant
husbands of little children who knew what
it meant to have the fingers of their play-
mates pointed at them in derision and to
hear the ignominious curse  his papa is
a thief

   to all the newspaper reports to all other
records of unfortunates ful ward simply
smiled and said fool he didnt know
how to play the game

  but on this particular night fulward
came to the conclusion that he didnt know
how to play the game cither sitting at his
desk he took a little red-covered pocket-
book fom the top drawer reached for pad
and pencil and began to figure

  with the care and accuracy of a trained
business man he had kept account of every
sum that had come to him through his me-
dium of dishonesty not only was the sum
recorded but the date on which it was taken
as well

  one by one fulward jotted on the pad

each item recorded in the red-covered book
then with the swiftness of an adding ma-
chine he added the sum it read 

  fulward leaned back astounded god
knows i can never pay it back he said

   it stared at him with the eyes of a demon
 it was awful it bit straight
into his conscience it seemed to cling to
him with the claws of a starving wolf

  for the first time in five years mr
oxenham fulward felt a cold and beady
sweat on his brow it is the sweat that
comes when fear enters the heart

  fulward didnt like it it seemed to
make him afraid of himself he had never
been that-no in all the years of his dis-
honest- he had never lost his nerve or his
belief that lie could  make good  to the
institution when the time came

  now the thing was rising before him like
an insuperable barrier

  fulward brushed the cold and beady
sweat from his brow and began to think
three things were quick in coming to him

  first he had to stop stealing then and
there the matter had been going on long
enough he would turn over a new leaf

  second he would make good the amount
at once

  third how

  the third was a stickler it dissolved
the other two as the sun dissolves the
darkness

  perhaps the best plan was to make a
good haul and take a flurry in the street
he could put his hands on some s
of the trust companys money inside of a
week for some unusually large collections
were coining in from the western banks

  he would watch the market closely he
knew where he could get a tip or two that
would be followed by a sudden rise-and all
would be well oh it was easy

  then the whole thing might be blamed
on another man there was bezon the
head collection-clerk a silent wan-faced
plodding young man his record was good
he had been bonded by the surety company
because an influential friend had vouched
for him he had to support a widowed
mother and all that-but sentiment could
have no place when the getting of a hundred
thousand dollars was the issue at stake

  of course he could not accuse bezon
outright bezon was perfectly honest and
could prove it bezon would have to be
found dead in the bank and naturally the
books would be examined and the shortage
the thousand-mile ticket



discovered and fulward would rise in
his might with horror-stricken countenance
and say how terrible why cant young
men respect and honor the trust that is
placed in them 

  mr fulward had an imaginative mind

  there was yet another way out of it
with peculiar force it struck fulward on
the solar-plexus of liis thinking apparatus
and he almost jumped with joy that final
way was the purloining of the thousand-
mile ticket

  the thousand-mile ticket was an heir-
loom as its name indicates it was a com-
mon form of transportation issued by a rail-
road company at its face value such a
ticket would be worth a paltry twenty dol-
lars but even if the dictates of the law
placed this particular document at such a
valuation mr j erasmus low would not
have taken ten thousand times that amount
for it-no not in cold cash

chapter ii

erasmus and the ticket

t erasmus low was a millionaire
  many times over singular as it may
seem the thousand-mile ticket had been
instrumental in making him such

  many years before he became a financial
power in the land before he ever thought
that he would be rich enough to give mil-
lions to research work millions to endow
public institutions millions to colleges and
millions to wipe out consumption the thou-
sand-mile ticket played a most important
part in his life

  the  j  in his name stood for john
in the early days when he was plain john
low and rather disturbed because his
parents had divided so simple and noble
a cognomen with the new england appella-
tion of a departed uncle he had saved the
life of a man by name thomas enger

  the horse which enger was driving be-
came unmanageable and young low a
tow-lieaded lad in a country village had
thrown himself bravely in the horses path
grabbed the infuriated animals bridle and
brought it to a halt

  enger thanked the boy being a calcu-
lating man he gave john fifty cents and
told him that he would remember him some
day

  that day came when j easmus low was
about twenty-five years old enger had

found it necessary to take a trip to new
york with his customary method of econ-
omy he purchased at he ticket-window of
the little depot the now famous thousand-
mile ticket as the train was pulling out
the unexpected happened

  it collided with a fast freight the
wreck was a bad one enger was carried
to the baggage-room in a bad way

  a doctor told him that his hours were
numbered he called for pen and ink took
the thousand-mile ticket from his pocket
and on the back of the long array of per-
forated coupons he wrote his will

   he disposed of various parcels of proper-
ty with a shaky hand remembered several
old toilers who worked about his farm cut
off an unworthy son with a penny and then
mustering his final courage made j eras-
mus low a benefactor to the extent of ten
thousand dollars  because as the dying
man wrote this brave boy with remark-
able heroism saved my life in a runaway
at the risk of his own

  that night old tom enger was gathered
unto his fathers seven days later j eras-
mus low received a check for the amount
of the bequest

   erasmus didnt dash madly to the city as
other boys who come suddenly into a for-
tune might have done erasmus fortunate-
ly was born with the money-making germ
well planted in his hearty system he knew
from that inborn trait that one dollar if
properly used will make another and he
accepted as his guiding-star the well-
founded hebraic doctrine that no man
should use money for his pleasure until he
has a comfortable nest-egg pickling in the
brine of gilt-edge investments

  erasmus came to new york he started
a loan business in a small way he loaned
on gilt-edge securities and first mortgages
and if the truth be told he never failed
to charge a little more than the legal in-
terest whenever he thought that the borrower
needed the money badly

  pie was quick to make his collections
quicker to foreclose when the borrower failed
to come to time and his call loans avere the
bogy of those who held them sentiment
had no place in the business notions of
young erasmus he hated nothing more
than the man who came to him and begged
an extra day or two in order to raise some
money

  before many months had passed the
original fortune of j erasmus low had


the railroad mans magazine

reached twenty-five thousand dollars then
it crept up to the fifty-thousand mark and
soon it was recorded at double that amount

  as time sped on it grew and grew and
by the time the tow-headed new england
boy had reached the mellow forties he was
the biggest man in the street his name was
a household word the picture of his sharp-
featured face was seen everywhere fond
mothers and jealous fathers pointed to him
with pride and told their sons that his was
the life to emulate that being president
of the united states was nothing to being
a j erasmus low

  when he was well settled in life with a
wife and family several homes motor-
cars and a yacht erasmus began the estab-
lishment of a private museum in a large
room of his fifth avenue mansion he gath-
ered the treasures of many lands as well as
treasures that marked various mile-posts in
his interesting career although these lat-
ter were of a personal nature they were
nevertheless as valuable to him as the real
and fake art objects of the old world for
which his money went so readily and
among them prided above all else was the
thousand-mile ticket

  because he was rich and powerful be-
cause his word was better than his bond
because he had done much for the little
town of his birth the courts had set aside
all precedent and permitted him to take the
queerly made will into his own keeping

  he had promised that it would be more
safe in his private museum than in the safe
of the county court that so long as life
was vouchsafed to him he would guard it
with personal care

  the newspapers at the time made much
of the incident they were given to re-
cording beyond the limit of veracity every
move that the millionaire made but their
display attending the transfer of the thou-
sand-mile ticket was of such exceptional
journalistic sensationalism that the ticket
became known from one end of the land to
the other

  the preying brotherhood of night ma-
rauders at once jotted all the foregoing on
their minds one day despite bolts and
bars the famous book of transportation
showed up missing of course it was stolen
only for the reward that was soon an-
nounced it was of goodly proportions
and the book without so much as a faded
letter was returned to its rightful owner
and no questions were asked

  j erasmus low then placed it in a
special estuary of beaten gold in the very
center of his museum and for many months
a squad of reserves whiled away the night
hours and cursed the bally thing that kept
them on such tiresome duty

  then again while its owner was motor-
ing through switzerland it disappeared
j erasmus cabled to america volumes of
instructions and again offered a reward that
meant a princely fortune to the lucky thief
or thieves as before it was returned to
its gold case in the low museum and no
questions asked

  up to the time of this narrative no one
had the courage to disturb it until oxen-
ham fulward sitting in his private office
in the snowball trust company racking
his brain for the quickest way to raise
 to cover his shortage hit upon
the theft of it as a particularly bright idea

  so many months aye years had elapsed
since its second disappearance that it had
escaped the popular mind as a topic of con-
versation if he could get his hands on it
the return would be a quick one no doubt
mr low could be made to pay as much as
several hundred thousand dollars if the
man with the precious will in his possession
held out long enough

chapter iii
from the iron gate

qxenham fulward sized up his
own precaricus situation there was
no cause for immediate danger the com-
pany was in good condition it had the
respect of a list of large depositors unused
thousandsrested in its vaults earning the
established three per cent a year which has
caused so much dissension between the com-
mercial banks and the trust companies he
was regarded as a first-class man no one
doubted his integrity or business methods
in short he could let the matter stand for a
week or two-meantime he could take some
action

  the more he thought of it the more the
theft of the thousand-mile ticket loomed
up as-a possibility he seemed to like the
idea the more he turned it over in his mind
he would work with the utmost caution
lay his plans with care and precision get
everything arranged so there would be no
hitch-in fact he would do it up brown

  his first plan was to look over the low
the thousand-mile ticket



mansion this gabled and monolithed
domicile stood in the center of the mile of
millionaires homes that bordered the east
side of central fark on the most aristo-
cratic avenue in all the world

  there is no time like the present
quoth fulward to himself and he tore up
the sheet of paper on which he had been
figuring recorded   in a corner
of the red-covered book returned this
chronicle of his crime to its resting-place
and started for the street

  shall i call you a cab sir said the
faithful patrick having devoured the politi-
cal sensations of the evening sheets

  no thank you carr replied the bank-
er after a hard days work a walk along
the streets will be more refreshing good
night

  once outside fulward hurried up-town
to his club while patrick was musing on
the hard life of the overworked banker
deprived of exercise by continuous appli-
cation to business and seeking fresh air in
the highways the object of his thoughts
was being whirled along in the subway to
that part of the city where the theaters and
gay hotels cover the area that is commonly
known as the tenderloin

   he went to his club ate a hurried dinner
donned a long coat and a gray soft hat
and made his way up fifth avenue tire
night was cool and inviting and fulwards
long perfecto never tasted quite so good
he seemed-to have a certain spring to his
step that pleased him greatly he was rath-
er gay and light-hearted rather jaunty and
debonair

  after a walk of some fifteen minutes
fulward reached the low mansion he
stood in the shade of a tree that jutted over
the central park fence it finally dawned
on him that he had done a foolish thing
for policemen no doubt were lurking in the
shadows taking mental photographs of all
who leered suspiciously at the house

  it came to him again and again that he
was foolish what could he discover how
could he help himself by simply staring
at that massive architectural monstrosity of
steel and stone

  he could have secured a description of
the place in any new york newspaper as
columns were devoted to the minutest de-
tails of its construction at the time of its
completion

  he looked cautiously about him there
were no officers in sight perhaps the guard

of reserves had been ordered to a more
pleasant task he turned a bluecoat was
coming down the avenue fulward started
in his direction with the casual air of a
man out for an evening stroll the officer
passed him by with silent tread fulward
surmised that he was the regular man on
patrol walked on for a block or so turned
crossed the street and walked back until
he was directly in front of the palace

   the museum is on the side facing the
cross street he said as he strolled thither
placing his hands behind his back and
swinging his cane with a careless gesture
he stood there in a brown study

  between the low mansion and the house
that stood at its rear was a large yard-
rather large indeed even for the home of a
new york millionaire the house was set
back from the street and so was the outer
wall of the yard this wall was of solid
brick and cement and was built to a height
of ten feet

   in the center of the wall was an entrance
-a heavy iron door-which opened only on
the inside fulward was taking it all in
with a critical eye this evidently was the
entrance used by the servants

  he wondered if the top of the wall were
smooth or covered with pieces of broken
bottles stuck in mortar he also wondered
if the private museum were within close
proximity of a certain window about five
feet above it and facing the street

  fulward might have been considered a
bit bold in thus exposing himself to the
police should any be around but he had
come to the conclusion that a man of his
standing in the community could easily ex-
plain his presence if accosted on the other
hand a lurking suspicious man would be
more quickly  covered  than he who came
out boldly

  his eyes were making hast measure-
ments of the various corners of the million-
aires home when with a peculiar sudden-
ness that made his heart thump the iron
door opened and a woman stepped out

  fulward started to walk away as one
unconcerned but something about the wom-
an arrested his attention

  with the easy eye of the connoisseur he
might have been admiring the building
instead he was looking at the woman

  he was quite sure that she was not one
of the servants for a servant would not
have stood on the threshold of the gate so
gingerly and looked so appealingly up and


the railroad mans magazine

down the block a servant would not have
started in the direction of madison avenue
and just because she saw a man approach-
ing from that thoroughfare turn and walk
toward fifth avenue but this particu-
lar maneuver pleased mr fulward he
walked to the corner of fifth avenue and
stood on the curb and waited

  the woman came along and stood very
close to him looking up and down the
thoroughfare

   in the darkness and because of the rather
heavy veil that covered her face it was not
easy to get a good view of her features
fulwards keen eye however was not slow
in gathering that she was rather young and
frail and dressed in good taste

  her hat was small and jaunty and the
cut of her clothing showed that she had
studied the modes around her neck was
a muffler of silver fox from the ends of
which dangled two tails of unusual size
and her hands were incased in a muff of
the same expensive fur

  fulward did not want to seem impolite or
impertinent he did not want to exhibit
an ungentlemanly curiosity or the leering
look of a policeman he wanted to know
why that young woman had so completely
arrested his attention

   just then one of the big green buses that
ply the avenue came along and the young
woman stepped forward held up a dainty
hand and got aboard

  it was only natural that fulward should
be waiting for the very same bus there-
fore he boarded too the vehicle was
somewhat crowded and the young woman
was so seated that when fulward wedged
himself into a comfortable attitude she was
directly in front of him

  she took a tiny purse from her muff
but she was some time in locating it in the
capacious hand-warmer for a moment
fulward felt that he might have to offer to
pay her fare

  fulward deliberately took her in from
head to toe she was rather pretty he
rould see through the veil in the brightly
illumined bus that she was more than
ordinarily good-looking with wavy blond
hair and a fair complexion

  fulward began to wonder if she were
aware of his persistent gazing she had
hardly looked at him but had kept her
poise so calmly under his apparent scrutiny
that he believed she was not disturbed
then he thought himself a fool for having

noticed her at all why had he gone to
this extreme why had he let this girl
arrest his mind to such an extent-he who
had cared so little for women as to have
remained a bachelor for forty-two years

  on the other hand there was something
so peculiar about the manner in which she
came out of the gate of the low mansion
something so queer so unnatural in her
manner as she looked up and down the
street that he was sure that she had a
secret hidden perhaps in the silver fox
muff which she held so gracefully he
wondered

  the bus rumbled into fifty - seventh
street near the corner of broadway the
girl beckoned to the conductor to stop in
another breath she had gracefully stepped
from the vehicle

  fulward was so wedged in that he was
unable to turn to see the direction in which
she started when she left the car he did
not care to attract attention by following
her so he rode on for three or four blocks
and then alighted turning toward broad-
way he walked in the direction of that
thoroughfare when he reached it-gay
with the white lights that have given it a
world-wide fame-he looked in either di-
rection not knowing which way to turn

   i will stroll toward forty-second
street he said maybe she will pass
me i know it is like looking for a needle
in a haystack but-maybe she will pass
me

   as fulward walked on he said again

   i dont know why i should have been
so terribly interested in that girl perhaps
it has some connection with the old theory
that it takes one thief to catch another
who knows

chapter iv

in the early hours

e ulward reached home rather early
that night home to fulward was
an apartment of three rooms in a building
entirely devoted to bachelors that stood
midway between fifth avenue and broad-
way in the forties-a building filled with
an array of apartments ranging from three
rooms to seven always crowded and always
popular and the tenants were all men whose
names stood for something in the various
callings of the great city

  fulward occupied one of the smaller
the thousand-mile ticket



apartments it was elaborately and most
comfortably furnished it contained all the
little things that a bachelor likes-a read-
ing-table and a drop-lamp a humidor for
cigars a great bowl of line tobacco and
a dozen pipes and a walnut sideboard in
which fulward kept a small but select stock
of rare wines and several bottler of whisky
-and in order to establish a side of this
mans character not hitherto told he was a
teetotaler in every sense of that hybrid word

   the liquids were kept only for his friends
and they were legion fulward made friends
and made them quickly having made
them he held them he spent money on
them with a lavish hand and he loaned it
to them to such an extent that he was called
a good thing his dinners were a delight
and his motor-trips to long island and
other spots dear to the new yorker were
frequently attended by large parties-and
fulward paid most of the bills

  fulward drew his comfortable chair
alongside his reading-table and lit his fa-
vorite pipe peering through the clouds of
smoke he reviewed his own criminal career
looked with a pitying face at the portrait of
his dear mother whom he thanked god was
dead and could never know the disgrace
that might come to him and then - he
thought of the girl

  suddenly he arose and paced the floor

  im a fool im a fool he said
aloud  why that woman was nothing-
nothing ill forget her there

  he did forget her he drove her from
his mind and all the next day and the next
he gave up his spare moments to the devel-
opment of the scheme that would lead to
the theft of the thousand-mile ticket that
was to be the paramount issue in his career
until it was consummated or proved to be
worthless

  it seemed to him that with his intimate
friendship among prominent men it would
not be impossible for him to get some sort of
an introduction to the low home it was
known in financial circles that the mil-
lionaire was not of the social few selected
by family age and wealth to represent the
elite of the metropolis although he had
added the  erasmus  to his name and re-
duced the john to a simple  j this was
for the purpose of having a signature that
would be unusual and not easy to imitate
should some evil-minded person try to use it
fraudulently

   aside from the exact value of the securi-

ties and first mortgages that came into his
keeping and the whirling flourish with
which he signed his famous name and his
art collection he had no other whims what-
soever he was a plain ordinary man
fond of all the good things of life but when
it came to putting on dadoes in order to
appear at mrs tufthunters tea or mrs
parvenus evening he was out of the run-
ning the only man or woman who was
better than j erasmus in his calculating
mind was the one who could make more
money than he

  so with this kind of a man to deal with
it did not seem difficult to fulward to get an
introductory letter on the pretense of ex-
amining some of the art treasures in the old
mans collections

  now there was jimmy stanwood jim-
my was a sort of majordomo to the lows
and when the head of the family preferred
the comfort of his bed to a night at the
opera jimmy acted as escort and got a
good dinner a ride in the low motor
bus and heard some good music-and all
because he was a comely good-for-nothing
with a pleasant manner and a good tailor

  yes jimmy would be just the very man
the very man indeed fulward would ask
him to dinner at the club and then in his
easy-going way would turn the subject to
art and art collectors and j erasmus low
would be the main topic

  and fulward would say how he would
give his life to see the wonderful things
that were stored in the low museum and
wouldnt jimmy-wouldnt he please give
him a letter to mr low or get permission
to bring him to the house or-anything so
long a lie could spend an hour or so in that
wonderful place drinking in the stories that
the collection would tell and incidentally
slip the thousand-mile ticket into his
pocket

  of course jimmy might hedge he
might feel that he would be overstepping
his privileges in the low household and
all that-but fulward had always been a
convenient man whenever a loan was needed
-and heaven knew that jimmy stanwood
needed one often enough

  yes that was the plan-the best most
possible plan

  fulward had come to that conclusion one
afternoon just before the close of the bank-
ing day before he left the office he took a
sheet of his private note-paper and wrote a
most polite note to jimmy asking him to


the railroad mans magazine

meet him at the dub for dinner on the
following night at seven and if he could
not make it on the night stated to come at
the earliest opportunity

   he placed the letter in his pocket he
 would mail it when he left the office lean-
 ing back in his chair he lit a cigar and
 smiled at the prospect he was more than
 pleased with himself he was a real genius
 a regular napoleon when it came to de-
 veloping diplomatic moves

   then like a mighty wave of desire like a
 powerful fever that robs one of his strength
 like the magnetism of one who vibrates in
 unison with our ideas fulward felt the
 inclination to steal come over him oh
 there could be no harm in dipping into the
 pot once more he had taken so much so
 very much that another thousand or two
 would not make the slightest difference
 whatsoever

   if he were to be caught it would be just
 as well to be hung for a sheep as a lamb

  these and similar thoughts passed
through his mind and they were emboldened
by the prospect of stealing the thousand-
mile ticket the absolutely certain prospect
the very great reward that would be offered
the return of the precious document the
 covering up of his peculations and the
honest upright life that he would lead ever
after no another thousand or two would
make no difference - no difference what-
soever

   fulward arose pushed his hat on the
back of his head swung open the door of
his private office and with the brisk air
and studied demeanor of a man on whose
head is resting the troubles of the world
walked into the collection department

   patrick carr did not pay the slightest bit
 of attention to him mr fulward was too
 familiar a figure around the offices work-
 ing after banking hours and patrick was
 too accustomed to his energy to give him
 even a look

   mr fulward entered the collection de-
partment he remained within its brass-
latticed walls for a period of ten or twelve
minutes then he returned to his own
office closed his desk put on his overcoat
and passed into the street at the first
mail-box he posted the letter to jimmy
stanwood then he took four five-hun-
dred-dollar bills from his trousers pocket
rolled them up tightly and transferred them
to his pocketbook

   he went up-town and after dinner to

his favorite pastime-roulette he played
with his usual luck he ran the two thou-
sand up to five thousand and then in an
effort to double dropped back when he
decided to quit there remained about five
hundred of the original two thousand

  when he reached home that night it was
unusually late he had played longer tharf
usual and it was nearly one in the morning
when he turned the key in the front door
and aroused the sleepy colored boy who
operated the elevator to a sufficient state of
animation to be taken up to his floor

  the hallway was illumined by subdued
electric lights and the heavy carpet on the
floor-purposely used so that those who
came home late would not disturb those
who were already asleep - seemed softer
than ever to his footsteps

  he inserted the key in the lock opened
the door and stepped inside all this he
did with a peculiar sense of the unwritten
rules of the apartment-rules made by the
bachelor tenants themselves-that one com-
ing in during the small hours would move
as much like a ghost as possible so ox-
enham fulward opened his door with the
caution of a nurse in a hospital ward and
with equal caution closed it

  he had thrown his coat half off when
an unmistakable metallic tapping in the liv-
ing-room turned him as livid as a stone

  he listened the tapping stopped and
then it started again

  there could be no mistaking the sound-
but what in the name of all that was good
could any burglar find in his rooms he
smiled at the thought

  he pulled his coat over bis shoulders
and stepped as softly as a cat from the
little hall into the room

  he knew just where the button was that
would throw the room into a flood of light
it was right at his elbow he had only
to touch it and the midnight marauder
would be cowering before him in all his
iniquity

  he watched the tiny round light of the
burglars lantern as it flashed up and down
the door of the walnut locker in which
he kept his liquors true he kept it locked
that the servants of the place might not be
tempted but what-what did that burglar
expect to find

  did he take it for a jewel-case ful-
ward was tempted to smile again

  he stood in the darkness a sharp pain
gathered in his breast for he was frightened
the thousand-mile ticket



lest something would disturb the worker
again the burglar ran his tiny lamp over
the locker again it dropped again there
was a muffled noise and again the click click
of the hammer on the jimmy as it slowly
pried its way into the lock

   poor fellow thought fulward  if he
is so hard up for a drink as to enter my
house and pry open my  wine-cellar  with
his blooming burglar-tools ill treat him to
a good four fingers of my best and let him
take a bottle home with him

    he raised his arm and silently pressed
 the electric button every light in the room
 flashed bright fulward threw up his hands
 and gasped

   a shriek-a womans shriek-pierced the
 astonished mans heart the marrow in
 his bones seemed to be turning to ice as he
 beheld the mingled picture of grief and
 shame crouching before him the very girl
 whom he had so keenly observed after she
  came out of the iron gateway of the palatial
 residence of j erasmus low

the man and his work

just why the erie railroad honored an engineer by naming his loco-
motive for him

a recent innovation of the erie railroad
in placing the name of a trusted engineer
on either side of the cab of his locomotive is
decidedly a move in the right direction this
man handled the same engine for a very long
period he contributed toward few if any engine
failures and he kept the machine out of the shop
for a phenomenal period as such things are
measured before heavy repairs became necessary
the interest which he feels in his locomotive is
largely proprietary he would not accept maybe
a better paying run because he could not take it
along with him on the new job now the com-
pany gracefully recognizes his faithfulness and
skill by identifying him with his engine

  we think well of this departure and are con-
fident that it will bring resulis in widespread effi-
ciency which will prove most gratifying it is
a very common old world procedure and was par-
ticularly recommended in instances of special
worthiness by the late m du bousquet of the
french northern railway one of the most able
demonstrators of the art of handling men who
ever held an executive position his splendid
locomotives on the paris-calais line the fastest
passenger service for the distance in the world
bear prominently the names of their engineers
and firemen the london brighton and south
coast railway paints the name of any engineer

of proved efficiency in his cab the london and
northwestern has it under consideration and
many continental roads have adopted the practise

  it conveys a hidden but nevertheless undeniable
appeal to any engineer and fireman despite the
fact that it would be difficult to define its exact
nature it is an assurance on the part of the
company that the locomotive in question will re-
main in possession of its master and that he
will thus be publicly proclaimed as a good engineer
just as long as the honor is merited there is not
a man in this world so indifferent as not to be
appreciative of this and who would not be reluc-
tant to see those big gold letters effaced from under
liis cab windows it is equally safe to assert that
anything he can do will be exercised to keep
them there

  a too liberal application of the idea might per-
haps lessen to some extent the high degree of
honor so conferred but the erie can be trusted
not to fall into this error so far there have been
but three locomotives  the system thus adorned
but vastly more than three of its engines are strug-
gling for like preferment no mistake has been
made by this railroad in establishing a plane of
superior and recognizcd merit and it is a de-
parture which may be- followed to advantage in
the locomotive practise of any country-american
engineer and railroad journal

freight brakeman to freight conductor and from
freight conductor to passenger conductor pas-
senger brakemen are generally promoted to train
-baggagemen but in late years a large percentage
of the train baggage work has been taken over by
the express companies principally because the
express companies pay a lower wage and also
prohibit their employees from affiliating with labor
organizations in many of the brotherhoods of
trainmen working agreements there will be found
the provision that a passenger brakeman cannot
be promoted to a conductorship until he has
served a given time as freight brakeman usually
two years it is reasonable to believe that freight
brakemen better understand practical railroading

than passenger brakemen and as it is found that
freight brakemen and conductors are in the ma-
jority their influence is shown in the working
agreements now in effect from the atlantic to the

  	when the reverse-lever is put in the center

  the  tom thumb  had a vertical multi-tubu-
lar boiler and was mounted on four wheels there
was one vertical double-acting cylinder

through the upper cylinder-head to a cross-head
running in two round guides the connecting
rod was attached to the outer end of the cross-
head and extended downward to a crank-arm on
an intermediate shaft secured below the frame
the end opposite to that carrying the crank-arm
had a gear which meshed with another equal tc
one-half of its diameter the latter being fixed to
one of the main axles the valves were worked
by eccentrics having v hooks the supply of
water for the boiler was carried in a barrel lo-
cated on the platform and connected with a pump

weighed only one ton it was not over i horse-

  you can do no better in your quest for definite
information on this position than to read care-
fully the three articles  surveying for a rail-
road  building a railroad-track and  keep-
ing a railroad-track in order these appeared
in the march april and may  numbers
respectively of the railroad mans magazine
the pay for a division engineer ranges from si
to maybe  a month he has charge of the
maintenance of the track on a division and some-
times of the bridges and buildings also where
the road does not have a superintendent of bridges
and buildings

   in this latter case his duties are practically con-
fined to track the section-foreman reports to
the supervisor and he in turn reports to the
division engineer or to a roadniaster who so re-
ports in order to make any headway in securing
such a position it would be necessary for you to
take a course in civil engineering and for that
reason college graduates have much better op-
portunities in the engineering than in the other
departments of railroading

quisite of an engineering education is waived
and the newcomer learns on the job call on one
of the division engineers of the boston and maine

explain to you what opportunity exists it is very
attractive work and is fairly well compensated

which part of a locomotive wheel moves
forward the faster the part at the top
or the part at the bottom-c h s
detroit michigan

  to prove that the top of the wheel moves the
faster would be quite easy through the use of a
diagram but it may surprise you to know that
the point of the wheel in actual contact with the
rail does not move at all this may seem in-
conceivable but it is an actual fact nevertheless

  the leverage of the main rod on the crank-pin
which in reality propels the locomotive must be
exerted at jsome point where the propulsion will
be of some avail otherwise the wheel would simply
turn in relation to itself and not move the loco-
motive in a progressive direction the point of
contact between the wheel and the rail therefore
becomes a fulcrum and it must remain stationary
in order that the leverage may be exerted

  of course the time that it is stationary is so
small as to be immeasurable nevertheless it exists
beyond dispute so much for the first or lower
point of the wheel under consideration

  a wheel is a circle and the center of this circle
in the instance of a locomotive would be tle
axle then so long as the lower part of the cir-
cumference does not move at all as has been ex-
plained the axle can only have a movement equal
to the actual progressive motion of the locomotive
on the rails while the upper part of the wheel

     rr

 must have a movement equal to twice that of the
 axle

   this may be a somewhat labored explanation
 but it is a fact which cannot be disputed the
 upper part of the wheel in direct answer to your
 question and taking diametrically opposite points
 of infinitesimal dimensions moves infinitely faster
 than the lower point the diagram vhich would
 convincingly illustrate this is known as that of
 the cycloid curve it is difficult to convey in

cb ottawa ontario-no cross-compound

	engines were built last year in the united
 states but some of the richmond type are now
 building at the montreal works of the american
 locomotive company for the grand trunk rail-
 way in the past they were used more in freight
 than in passenger service but have been run in
 passenger with fair average results

   it is recalled in this connection that the south-
 ern railway had one no  which did very
 well in passenger service between knoxville and
 chattanooga tennessee during  at which
 time the editor of this department enjoyed the
 honor of assisting in its performance theoreti-
 cally the advantage of a compound locomotive
 over a simple engine lies in its ability to utilize
 a greater degree of the expansion of the steam
 a greater degree of temperature between the live
 and the exhaust steam and therefore for the
 same work performed its smaller consumption of
 steam

   with the cross-compounds the limit of power
 available is attained when the diameter of the
 low pressure cylinder is so great as to reach the
 clearance limits allowed on any particular road
 in practise about  inches and in addition
 they possess the defect of all two-cylinder engines
 lack of balance which is destructive to track and
 roadbed compared with simple locomotives do-
 ing the same kind of work compounds show a
 saving in coal and water of  to  per cent

   stated in another way the compound develops
 from  to  per cent more power than the
 simple engine of the same type consuming an
 equal amount of fuel and water liability to
 breakdowns and cost of repairs are items which
 usually show a balance in favor of the simple
 engine

   the fastest runs in europe on which you desire
 information are not made by engines of the cross-
 compound type read the article in the febru-
 ary number of the raiiroad mans maga-
 zine  europes most famous run and the dif-

rb kcsseville new york-the westing-

	house  et  brake-equipmeni represents
a development of the automatic brake so it is
rather difficult to say which type is now in more
general use although the  et  equipment has
made vast strides since its introduction there is
every reason to believe that the older or automatic
form still remains in the majority practically
all new locomotives however are equipped with
the  et

  there is  reason why a train could not be
held for ten minutes on a slight grade by the air-
brake it would no doubt leak off in time but
the attention which is now being given this detail
would practically insure against this

  a book which would help you very much in
your preparation for the duties of a fireman is
 standard mechanical examinations on locomo-
liye firing and running published by f j
drake  co chicago illinois it contains the
progressive examinations for the first second and
third-year firemen which have been adopted as
standard by the traveling engineers association

what is meant by the term  working pres-
sure 

          are compound locomotives with
the exception of the mallet type a complete suc-
cess in this country if not why

  	what is meant by reducing the pressure
of a locomotive

  	is there an advantage in the belpaire
boiler over the wagon-top or straight type and
why is the pressure per square inchgenerally
greater in the belpaire-s c h avon new
york

  	it means the amount of steam pressure in
pounds per square inch under which the boiler
has been designed to work

 	see reply to  c b ottawa ontario
 in this issue

  	it may mean one of two things de-
pendent upon the conditions as ordinarily em-
ployed the term implies reducing the steam
pressure as shown per gage in the face of some
emergency as for instance where the throttle-
valve cannot be closed or to pack some cock or
the throttle-stem where the packing has blown out

  it is usually effected by removing one of the
steam-chest relief valves and opening the throttle-
valve or waste can be wrapped around the open-
ing of the whistle-bowl to deaden the sound and
the whistle opened this process however is
much slower than that first mentioned

  reducing pressure is also resorted to as a per-
manency when a boiler grows old or where de-
fects in design are present which makes it inad-
visable for the locomotive to carry the pressure
contemplated in the instance of an old boiler
originally designed to carry  pounds pressure

per square inch they are usually cut down to 
pounds after some fifteen years

   	each of these two types of boilers has its
own advantages and disadvantages and these have
been the subject of much discussion it must be
finally recognized that neither the one nor the
other is very definite but the wagon top boiler
is more extensively used and it appears to be
preferable in the case of large boilers a few of
the larger railroads including the pennsylvania
and its allied lines and the great northern are
using the belpaire boiler but in each case their
latest engines have been equipped with the wagon
top or round top form the belpaire is some-
what more expensive to construct than the other
and adds a certain amount to the weight of the
boiler without a corresponding increase in the
heating surface hence the largely predominating
use of the simpler wagon top the belpaire does
not carry any more pressure than the other type
of boiler

jf q napa california-some of the prin-

	cipal reasons for using the walschaert valve-
gear are the following it is lighter and more ac-
cessible for adjusting cleaning and oiling than
the stephenson gear must necessarily be on a
large engine by removal of the valve-motion

parts from between the main frames more sub-
stantial cross bracing and stiffening of these
frames is permitted the increasing size of axles
and greater throw of eccentrics requiring larger
sheaves coupled with the lateral play of driving-
boxes results in rapid wear to stephenson ec-
centrics and straps the inertia due to the in-
creased size of these parts long and heavy trans-
mission bars etc has a great deal to do with
shortening the life of the stephenson motion as
a whole a strong point of the walschaert gear
is that once properly set the valves remain square
longer than with the stephenson this goes far
to offset the probable better general steam distri-
bution obtained by the latter motion for if the
valves donot remain as set the economy from that
setting is lost theoretically the constant lead of
the walschaert gear is a distinct disadvantage
when applied to a locomotive which is to be
operated at any considerable range of speed but
in practise this objection is more than offset by
the greater ease with which the reverse-lever can
be handled

when kate shelley saved the express

the recent retirement of e g wrood one of
the oldest engineers in the service of the
chicago and northwestern railway brings to
light a most interesting story of railroading

  mr wood was one of the engineers who grew
up with the northwestern he was born in new
york state in  where he spent his first
quarter of a century and where he became the -
husband of miss clara main like many other
energetic young men the west looked attarctive
to him so in  he and his wife set their faces
toward the prairies of iowa they stopped at
boone which was the terminus of the chicago
and northwestern at that time and started a
boarding camp for the men who were building
the first bridge across the des moines river

  it was at this bridge in later years that the
most thrilling incident in his life occurred says
the north western about sunset july  
a tempest burst with terrible fury in iowa in an
hour the des moines river had risen six feet
kale shelley a girl eighteen years old stood at
a window looking at the honey creek bridge
when she saw through the darkness the headlight

of an engine move steadily along for a moment
and drop suddenly she ran to the bridge after-
lighting an old miners lantern held in a railroad
frame and saw that the bridge was gone  she
shouted and swung her lantern over the rushing
water a faint answer came from the engineer
who was the only survivor of the crew

  the engineer told her to go to moingona sta-
tion a mile away and warn the fast express
train then nearly due she ran to the high
trestle  feet long over the des moines river
where her light went out in the storm she
crawled across the dizzy structure reached the
station told her story and fell unconscious

  the engineer who sent her on that mission
was e g wood he remained in the water until
six oclock next morning when he was rescued
by thomas mcpherson a miner

  mr wood began firing for the chicago and
northwestern in  but the iowa farm lands
looked good to him and the next year he took
a farm but in  he reached his final choice
and has been in the engine service of the com-
pany ever since

                why the second appearance of the
                vision proved a tragedy after all

        wouldnt have believed that
one could find such a bit of
wilderness so near the city if
i hadnt seen it with my own
eyes observed post looking
out of the car window at the
rugged country

  city jeered harding derisively
you call olney a city why new york
could put the whole shebang into one
pocket and never hear it shake

   however he added  we wont knock
olney until we hear what mystery she has
to offer us from what miss westmore
said in her letter i should think-

  bother miss westmore interrupted-
post dont lets talk shop to-night it
will be time enough when we have to by
jove rus look isnt that picturesque
harding dropped his paper and leaned
forward the train was just entering a
deep cut so narrow that the frowning rock
walls seemed almost to graze the car win-
dows it had been a huge task to hollow
out a space sufficiently wide for even the
single track which here took the place of
the regular two-track system of the road

  the roar and rattle of the cars echoed
and reechoed from the rocks the deafening
clatter making conversation difficult

  nice place for an accident said post
id like to see it by daylight ill bet
its simply wonderful its so infernally
dark outside now that i cant make out-
the sentence was never finished the
whistle shrieked a jarring lurch threw
the passengers forward

  posts head came into violent contact
with the back of the seat ahead of him
and lie was temporarily stunned

  when he recovered his senses he saw
his friends startled face bending over him

  are you all right jimmie harding
asked anxiously

  post sat up passing his hand over his
forehead in a half-bewildered way

   i-i guess so he said dazedly  my
head hurts like sam hill but i guess it
isnt broken whats happened have
we run into anything

   i dont know replied harding  the
train stopped-emergency brakes i havent
had time to find out why we may have
run over some one or hit something on the
track but if so i dont think its anything
very big if you feel like it well get out
and see

  the few passengers had all left the car
and a perfect babel of voices filled the air
outside mea were shouting and lanterns
were flashing

  post and harding made their way be-
tween the coaches and the wall of rock to
the engine which had stopped in the cut
a few rods from the mouth of a tunnel a
circle of excited gesticulating men sur-
rounded a dark object which lay between
the rails

  is there a doctor here called out
some one as the investigators hurried up

  for a moment there was no reply then
post spoke

   im not a doctor but my father is and
ive studied a bit with him what is it

   the engineer this way he looks
as if he were dead

  the crowd parted to let post through
on die ties just ahead of the pilot lay a
man flat on his back his rigid face show-
ing ghastly white in the glciv of the head-
light his knees were drawn half way up
and his arms were outstretched

  post bent over him felt his pulse and
then made a hastv examination


the sudden-death semaphore



  has any one any brandy he asked

  some one produced a flask and post
forced a few drops of the spirit between
the engineers set lips in a moment or
two a flush of life stole into the pallid
cheeks the man stirred and uttered a low
moan

   hes better now i think said post
rising to his feet  seems to have fainted
how came he here was he thrown from
the cab 

  no one seemed to know and the fireman
was not in sight if the sudden applica-
tion of the emergency brake had hurled the
engineer through the open cab window on
to the track a happening unlikely enough
at best the locomotive would still have had
sufficient headway to run over him and
must inevitably have done so yet he was
lying fully two yards ahead of the pilot

  the escaping steam filled the air with
its sharp hissing the gleam of the head-
light flickered weirdly into the blackness
of the tunnel and upon the rocky walls of
the cut

  a few yards further along the green of
the block-signal indicated a clear track
the little group around the engineer had
fallen strangely silent the whole scene was
ghostly and unreal

  post looked about for harding and dis-v
covered him standing a little way back in
earnest conversation with the fireman as
his eye fell upon his partner he beckoned
to him

  this is mr jackson jimmie he said
as post came up  my partner mr post
jackson i have been hearing quite a re-
markable story jim which well hear again
later hows your patient

   better replied post  hell do all
right wait hes coming to i must see
to him

  he hurried back just in time to see the
engineer open his eyes and try to struggle
to a sitting position

  im done for came in a low shaking
voice from the pale lips

  nonsense man cried post cheerily
it was just a faint

  im done for i tell you no use wa-
sting any time over me the engineers
voice sank to a whisper ive seen the
 fantom engine 

  the passengers who were near enough to
hear exchanged glances

  the  fantom engine  the man was
crazy

  with the help of a couple of men the
engineer was carried into the baggage-car
he was so shaken and unnerved that he
was totally unfit to run the engine and
accordingly the fireman took his place at
the throttle while the brakeman volunteered
to act as fireman pro tern

  while the train moved slowly through the
tunnel toward olney post harding and
the conductor remained in the baggage-car
with the engineer who was in a state of
utter collapse

  he seemed either unable or unwilling to
explain his action in stopping the train
or to tell what he had seen or heard he
lay on the floor his eyes closed his hands
clenching and unclenching muttering that
he had twice seen the  fantom engine
and that his time had come

  post dared not interrogate him as it
appeared to excite him and the young man
feared to aggravate a condition which might
prove very serious

  in the coaches there was but one subject
of conversation-the inexplicable stopping
of the train in the middle of the cut with
the signals indicating a perfectly clear block
ahead

  the only solution of the mystery seemed
that the engineer had suddenly gone crazy
and imagined that his train was about to
collide witli something that would ex-
plain his references to the  fantom en-
gine as surely no sane man would talk
and act as he had

  olney the terminal was reached with-
out further incident as post left the bag-
gage-car having turned his patient over
to a local physician he was met by hard-
ing looking rather the worse for wear hot
tired and begrimed

   jackson has got to take his train in
and make a report and then hes coming
over to the hotel harding said well
cut along and clean up before he comes
im hungry too

    jackson   queried post

  yes the fireman theres more in this
than meets the eye jimmie that engi-
neer isnt crazy he is just plumb scared
to death jackson himself was almost too
frightened to talk about it but i got him
to promise to meet us in our room as soon
as hes off duty

   i guess m iss westmores case will havq
to stand over a day im going to investi-
gate this  fantom engine  business

   what under the sun do you want to go


the railroad mans magazine

wasting your time and getting mixed up
in any little local fuss like this for when
theres an interesting case and a big fee
waiting for you post wanted to know

  harding dropped one arm over his
friends shoulder as they walked along over
to the hotel

  for two reasons jimmie said he
first of all jackson is engaged to that
engineers daughter and he says it will
about break her heart if her father is dis-
missed from the road which he certainly
will be if the officials think lies seeing
things

   the second reason is that the super-
intendent is likely to pay a fair-sized sum
to have this mystery cleared up because if
such a superstition gets to be current on
the line it will hurt business people dont
patronize a road if they think the employ-
ees are crazy you know

  after getting rid of the accumulated coal-
dust of their trip the partners ate a hur-
ried dinner and went up to their room to
await the arrival of the fireman in a very
few minutes the latter was announced

  snow mr jackson said harding
when he had seated himself will you be
good enough to repeat to mr post exactly
what you told me i want him to hear it
at first hand and see what impression he
gets of it

  the fireman shifted uneasily in his seat
and cast a furtive glance at the door which
harding promptly closed

   im not what youd call a coward gen-
tlemen he said apologetically but some-
how these last two nights have got my
goat it was this way he went on turn-
ing to post

  joe pratt - thats the engineer - was
speeding up a little last night because of
being a couple of minutes late i was put-
ting a shovelful of coal on the furnacewhen
suddenly i heard him give a yell then he
slapped on the emergency same as lie done
to-night and like to threw me head over
heels

   i looked up and there pratt white as
a ghost with his eyes popping out of his
head we hadnt hit nothing and i asked
what was up he didnt say a word for
a minute but just sat there staring ahead
then he turns around and whispers  the
fantom engine pete ive seen it  

   just a minute interposed harding
mr post and i are strangers here what
is the  fantom engine   

    it aint anythin sir and thats a fact 
was the astonishing reply  i cant tell
you its an engine because there aint never
anythin there but them as sees it twice
running aint long for this world if a
man sees it only once it means a warnin
twice is-death  

  there was no mistaking the fact that
jackson believed implicitly what he was
saying his voice was low and earnest
and although he kept his eyes cast down
his manner bore the stamp of truth

   do you mean to tell me that pratt-
who looks like an intelligent man-believes
all that nonsense and that he thinks he
saw this engine demanded post

  jackson shook his head

   he didnt just think he saw it sir
he did see it he told me the headlight
flashed right into his eyes just after he
passed the curve at the center of the cut

   he thought cf course the signal had
gone wrong and that another train was
coming and he slammed on the brakes
expecting every minute to crash head-on
into the other train

   he says he just shut his eyes and when
nothing happened he opened them again
there wasnt any other train there the
track was clear ahead then he knew it
was the  fantom engine  hed seen and he
-well sir it was pretty bad for him youll
allow

   but i dont quite understand said
harding  where did this idea about the
 fantom engine  originate nobody be-
lieves in ghosts these days

   didnt you ever hear how the olney
express ran head-on into a wildcat engine
about ten or twelve years ago  

  harding shook his head

   the brakeman told us diey d never had
an accident in the cut cried post

   it was before they put the block sig-
nals in explained jackson there hasnt
been one since then it happened just
around the curve in the cut-the same place
where we stopped to-night-and last night

  the olney express was late and the
engineer was making up time he saw

o 	o	j

the headlight coming and tried to stop but
he ran right into the engine there wasnt
nobody on her-she was running wild

  the engineer of the express was killed
and the fireman died the next day he
just got his senses long enough to tell
the story of the accident he saw the en-
gine too  n
the sudden-death semaphore



   it wasnt long after that that matt
wales saw an engine coming right for him
he threw on the brakes but when the train
stopped there wasnt any engine there it
shook him up considerable but he stuck to
his train same as mr pratt done and
the next night-wales saw it again

   he died in the ambulance they got for
him at olney i tell you mr harding i
dont want to see that engine you see it
-and it isnt there to see the fireman
shuddered

  i dont mind the things you can get
ahold of he said  i aint afraid of
man or beast if ive got a chance for my
life but-well there was jack-

  never mind the others interrupted
harding lets hear about pratt you
didnt see the headlight last night-or to-
night 

  no i didnt thank heaven said the
fireman fervently poor joe i heard
him yell to-night but before i could get
to him he was out of the cab and runnin
ahead then he turned around and came
tearing back only to fling up his arms and
fall in a heap on the track

   so thats how he happened to be lying
just ahead of the pilot said post  i
couldnt figure out why he hadnt been run
over if he had been thrown out by the
shock of stopping so suddenly

   is- there anything else mr harding
asked jackson he had been getting more
and more uneasy and seemed in haste to
be gone

  nothing thank you returned hard-
ing except that i may want to ask you
some other questions to-morrow ill have
to get the superintendents permission to
take this up i presume

  but youll do all you can for joe
wont you the fireman asked pleadingly
 poor lou - thats his daughter - shell
take on awful if they fire him sir

   ill do my best promised harding
and jackson took his departure declaring
he stood ready to lend all the assistance he
could

  well jimmie what do you make of
it harding leaned back in his chair
and regarded his friend witli wide inter-
ested eyes j

  post shruggecf his shoulders

  jackson is off his head he returned
hes been bitten by the superstitious bug
pratt is undoubtedly crazy and ought to
be locked up to have a man like that in

charge of human freight is nothing less
than a crime

    fantom engine indeed fantom rot
ive heard of a man seeing pink armadillos
and plaid elephants but never the ghost of
an engine

  harding took out his watch looked at it
and rose

  thats your opinion is it said he
weil im sorry but i cant agree with
you-at least not about pratt hes as
sane as you or i he saw something-the
question is-what

  ridiculous snorted post  how
could he see anything when there was noth-
ing to see jackson admits that the track
was clear last night and we ourselves know
that it was to-night

   the cut at the mouth of the tunnel is
so narrow that it couldnt have been any-
thing beside the track if there is a path
down the rocks it would be too steep for
an engine to climb rus

  harding smiled

  thats all right jimmie as far as it
goes- he returned  ill grant you that
nothing could have been on the track with-
out our seeing it to-night yet something
did get away im going to find out what
that  something  was

   i wish you joy in the job then said
post skeptically  probably it was an
aeroplane carrying a headlight and just
as soon as pratt saw it the aviator flew
away

   all right laugh if you will retorted
harding  its getting late and im go-
ing to bed ive got a hard days work
ahead of me to-morrow

  he was up earl- in the morning and
immediately after breakfast called upon the
division superintendent as he had expect-
ed he found that gentleman somewhat per-
turbed about the occurrences of the last two
nights and although he was inclined to be
a trifle reserved at the beginning of the in-
terview he soon thawed under the influence
of hardings shrewd observations and the
obvious interest he showed in the case

   i am inclined to let you and your
partner try your hands mr harding he
said after harding had emphatically de-
clared his implicit belief in the engineers
sanity  in fact i had just telephoned
to your hotel for you when my clerk told
me that you were waiting to see me

  miss westmore rang me up early this
morning and urged that i should have a


the railroad mans magazine

talk with you before proceeding further
she is a relative of mine and seems to have
great faith in your ability

  joe pratt has-been in our employ for
a number of years and we have always
found him careful and reliable he is
honest steady does not drink and keeps
good company his daughter is a nice
iittle girl and thinks the world of her
father

   i should be sorry to think that he is
suffering from hallucinations and yet un-
til i have something to go upon i cannot
well think anything else this supernat-
ural business is all bosh

  the belief that a doomed man sees the
 fantom engine  is then current among the
men queried harding

  the superintendent laughed

   i believe so but you may be sure it
is confined to the shops if any of the
officials were to question the men he would
undoubtedly be assured that they had never
put any faith in the stories

  what about matt wales i under-
stand that he saw this fantom twice run-
ning and died immediately afterward

  matt wales was crazy his wife had
died very suddenly and i think he never
was the same man after it then too his
son was a disappointment to him and he
brooded over his domestic troubles

   you know how a superstition will
cling once a foothold for it has been es-
tablished wales was an ignorant unedu-
cated man quite different from the general
run of engineers but he had worked his
way up by sheer tenacity of purpose and
there was little about an engine that he did
not understand thoroughly

   but as far as pratt is concerned i
think he would put no faith in any bogy
business i cant reconcile his words last
night with what i know of his character
i shall be mighty glad if you will get to
the bottom of it though frankly i dont
see how you expect to go about it

  in addition to my regard for pratt
personally  believe that in letting you
take up this case i am acting in the best
interests of the road we are not a large
corporation mr harding and competition
is very keen

   you can readily see that if this super-
stition spreads it is going to hurt us once
let the public get nervous about traveling
over our line and our business is going to
fall away to nothing

  harding nodded slowly

    i see your position he said

   now i have heard of the work you
and mr post have done in just such puz-
zling cases as this continued the superin-
tendent  and while i believe that you
have undertaken an enigma this time im
willing to have you try to solve it and shall
pledge you a substantial fee if you succeed
in finding out what pratt really saw like
you i am loath to believe him crazy or to
think that his  ghost  was really the image
of a diseased brain

    i am willing to take the case on a con-
tingent fee returned harding no pay
unless we are successful the only thing
i want is your cooperation i shall have
to call upon jackson for assistance he
leans toward the ghost theory but i be-
lieve i can get some help from him nev-
ertheless

  use jackson all you can agreed the
superintendent  hes going to marry lulu
pratt and hes naturally interested in her
father when young wales-matts son-
went to the bad we gave jackson his place
on pratts engine and hes getting along
very well

   good morning mr harding and good
luck to you i hope you will keep me
advised of any progress you may make
during the rest of the morning harding
was very busy he held a long conference
with jackson and also with the engineer
who was to take the unfortunate pratts run

  then he paid a visit to pratts home but
the old man was in such a precarious con-
dition that the physician in attendance
would allow no one to enter

    you see he is firmly convinced that he
saw this  fantom engine  explained the
doctor  and he believes that it foretold his
death unless i can rid his mind of this
idea i cannot be answerable for the con-
sequences

   i am trying to prove that he saw no
such fantom said harding  can you
will you allow me to circulate the report
that pratt is better and will make his usual
run on the express to-night instead of the
man now in charge of the train

  the physician was puzzled but when
harding had explained his motive for ma-
king such a singular request he not only
acquiesced but even agreed to help person-
ally in the deception

  and now jimmie said harding when
he had rejoined his friend at the hotel that
the sudden-death semaphore



afternoon  we have our work cut out for
us the first thing is to see about hiring
an automobile

  what do we need an automobile for
asked post curiously

  harding gave a provoking laugh

   you made fun of all of my theories
and im going to leave you in doubt he
answered  but ill tell you this much
there is a road over the hills back of ol-
ney that has a continuation in a narrow
path over the top of the tunnel and along
the edge of the cut through which the rail-
road track runs we are going up there
this afternoon to await developments

  late that afternoon a small but stanch
automobile might have been seen wending
its way along the hilly road back of the
city it was occupied by harding and
post investigators and a chauffeur the
latter wondered where they were going but
wisely asked no questions

  he stopped his machine and let his pas-
sengers out about a mile above the curve
in the railroad cut and then drove back to
the city

   this is going to be a pretty ticklish
job jimmie said harding as they walked
along together  we had to come up here
early because i wasnt sure whether i could
find the right place in the dark i guess
our man is sufficiently familiar with the
surroundings to come at any hour but i
fancy he wont show up for some time yet
 our man  inquired the mystified post
 certainly that is i hope so i also
have reason to believe that lie will try his
little game again to-night because i have
conscientiously circulated the report that
joe pratt is going to take his train through
as usual although the poor fellow is really
in bed and the doctor despairs of his life
now i want you to keep your eyes
open and your mouth shut if you see
anything unusual take it all in but dont
say a word i cant be certain of the exact
spot where he will appear or if he will ap-
pear at all but i think im right

   ill stay in one place and you in an-
other and well nail him some way dont
for your life let him get away after the
train has passed grab him and hang 
dont let him give you the slip but above
all dont lay a finger  him until the
train has gone by the place where he is
then collar him and yell for me ive got
a coil of rope in my pocket and well truss
him up

  if im nearer him than you are ill
do the collaring and you come and help me
out is that clear

   its all clearexcept who  he  is what
hes going to do and what in thunder the
whole thing means said post a trifle rue-
fully you might give me a hint

  harding laughed

    ill tell you all about it when its over
he said  i dont want to give it away
until im sure that im right now you
stav here

  he drew post into the shadow of a tall
rock about a hundred feet from the edge
of the cliff which fell in a sheer drop to
the mouth of the tunnel

  this is an excellent hiding-place lie
added til go on a little farther keep
absolutely still remember with a wave
of his hand lie vanished among the trees

  post stared amazedly at the spot where
his friend had disappeared

   heres a go  said lie  i wonder how
long ill have to decorate the landscape
before the show begins and id like to
know whats afoot anyway confound
rus and the mysterious  he  

  he sat down behind the big rock and
made himself as comfortable as possible
by leaning his back against it in the
west the sun was setting in a sky flecked
with rose and gold

  the towering hills at the foot of which
the-city of olney lay were tinted in gor-
geous hues but in the shadow of the great
trees that hemmed in the rock  all sides
twilight was already beginning to fall

  it was very still very desolate very
lonely post was not a fanciful person
but the long dusky shadows the intense
stillness unbroken ever by the call of a
bird somehow made him uneasy dark-
ness came swiftly the tall almost leaf-
less trees sighed above his head

  from somewhere far to the right came
the harsh disagreeable scream of a screech-
owl it seemed like the cry of a child in
terror or pain post stirred impatiently
he wondered where harding was and what
he was doing all this time

  what was that

  surely something more than the noise of
the wind in the branches

  post sat bold upright and then cautious-
ly rose to his feet peering out from behind
the rock that shadow-the one under
the big maple that he had been idly watch-
ing-liad moved


the railroad mans magazine

  it was no longer a mere impalpable
shadow but the figure of a man-a man
moving silently stealthily toward the edge
of the cliff over the tunnel entrance

  was it harding or the mysterious he
post could not tell he longed to call out
but he dared not-dared not move a step
lest the sound of his footfalls convey a
warning to the intruder

  the shrill scream of a whistle rent the
air the train was entering the lower end
of the cut the green light of the sema-
phore spelled clear track ahead

  trembling with excitement and antici-
pation post waited what was the man
about to do whatstrange drama was
about to be enacted from posts position
the track itself was invisible but he had
a clear unobstructed view of the man who
was moving quickly about apparently en-
gaged in manipulating a rope

  with a roar the train swept around the
curb traveling at high speed and then-
a low exultant laugh came from the edge
of the cliff

  the whistle sounded there was a grind-
ing of brakes surely that had been hard-
ings laugh but at what had he laughed 
was it harding

  the young man did not hesitate he had
had his directions and he must follow them
scarcely had the strange sound died away
when he impulsively started forward his
foot caught in the tangle of vines and un-
derbrush and he plunged forward on his
face amid a loud crackling of twigs and
branches

  an agonized shriek came to his ears a
shriek so full of horror and fear that his
blood seemed to run cold

  he struggled to his feet just in time to
see a dark body hurtle through the air over
the edge of the cut and whirl down-down
-down into the blackness beneath 

  sick at heart trembling appalled post
crawled unsteadily to the brink of the
rocky wall and leaned over the train
had come to a stop at the mouth of the
tunnel men with lanterns were running
back and forth

 what was it-who was it who had
gone down to such a frightful end post
strained his eyes at first he could see
nothing but after a moment he made out
the dim outlines of a shapeless mass that
lay huddled in the narrow space between
the wall and the rails-a mass that did
not move when the trainmen bent over it

  post found his feet and dashed back
along the way harding had gone that after-
noon twice he stumbled and fell

  the low-growing branches of the trees
lashed his face but the only feeling of
which he was conscious was- that he must
get down to the tracks to that sinister heap
lying there he must know if russell
harding had met that hideous fate

  jimmie the call halted him in his
tracks

  jimmie came the voice again and
a moment later harding was at his side

   rus  the emotion of seeing his
friend was so great that for an instant
post choked he forgot the man who had
plunged headlong to destruction

  who was it he whispered

  young wales i think great heaven
what a terrible death come jimmie
theres a path just below here well go
down to the train dont ask me any-
thing now ive made a mistake a mis-
calculation i couldnt get to you although
i tried i was too far along

  in silence they made their way down
the steep winding path that led to the
tracks it was a hazardous undertaking
for the thick darkness obscured the way
but they finally reached the bottom and
walking along the ties got aboard the last
car of the train and walked through the
half-empty coaches to the baggage-car

  there the superintendent met them

  this is a bad business gentlemen he
said gravely  im afraid youve been
hurt he added as he noted posts scratch-
ed face and bleeding hands and the torn
and disordered clothes of both the partners

   im all right post hastened to say
 i thought for a moment that it was hard-
ing who had gone over the cliff he
shuddered slightly  it was so dark that
i couldnt make out the mans face and as
soon as the train had passed and i started
for him he-he-it was too late

  the superintendent nodded

   poor fellow   he said  they have
taken him into the baggage-car you
know of course that it was matt waless
son  

   yes said harding  that is what i
thought

   i was on the train myself-on the en-
gine in fact continued the superintend-
ent  and i dont wonder that pratt was
frightened i saw that headlight plainly
-too plainly it was no fantom mr
the sudden-death semaphore



harding but the most realistic thing i ever
saw in my life

   for pratt to see it as i saw it and then
find nothing tangible to account for it
must have been a terrible shock

  as we came around the curve the light
flashed full in our eyes the engineer had
told me that he had his directions from you
and so he whistled and applied the brakes
we heard a crash and a terrible cry on the
track ahead and i sent the brakeman to
investigate

   i understand of course that wales
was in some way responsible for all this
but i confess i am still in ignorance of
how he produced the illusion

   if you will wait a minute harding
said  i think i can make it all plain to
you he descended the steps and a mo-
ment later his voice rang out

  mr cleve-jimmie here

  they found him standing a few rods
ahead of the engine holding up something
that flashed in the light of the lantern
jackson had lifted over his head

  what is it rus cried post

  harding held out a hollow square seem-
ingly of wood with splintered pieces of
glass clinging to it here and there

  do you know what it is

  they did not for the moment

   the frame of a large mirror this is
what caused pratt to see the  fantom

   by means of a rope and pulley wales
lowered the mirror over the edge of the
cliff so that the headlight of the approach-
ing train would be reflected directly into
the engine cab

   then he quickly pulled it back so that
it should not be struck he kept it con-
cealed somewhere in the bushes on top of
the cut

  the superintendent gave a cry

   but what-what was his object in doing
this in jeopardizing the lives of the pas-
sengers and train crew

  before replying harding led the way
back to the cars which were ready to start
on their interrupted journey to olney

   i learned this morning that young
wales believed pratt to be responsible for
his dismissal from the road he was jn
the habit of drinking heavily and when
pratt reported his last spree a report which
led to his being summarily discharged-
he swore he would get even

   his dissolute habits had also caused
pratt to forbid his daughter lulu to see

wales and the girl herself refused to have
anything to do with such a character

   in his anger at pratt and at jack-
son whom he believed to have supplanted
him in his work and also in the affections
of the girl he loved wales conceived the
idea of ruining the old man by playing
upon his imagination

   the simple apparatus which he rigged
up produced a perfect illusion of another
train in the cut and knowing very -well
that pratt shared to a certain degree the
superstition current in the shops that the
man who saw the  fantom engine  twice
running was doomed wales resolved to
shock pratt and johnson and encompass
their dismissal

   and that his cowardly design failed
is entirely due to you mr harding ex-
claimed the superintendent

  my only regret is that i was unable to
prevent the tragedy replied harding  i
did not dare to get too close for fear of
scaring him away

   i spread the report that pratt was bet-
ter knowing that wales would be more
than likely to make a final attempt at
once as he would count on the old mans
mind not being strong enough to stand an-
other shock if wales had known that
pratt was ill at home he would not have
produced his ghost again

   but how-how did he happen to-
the superintendent paused

   he must have heard post fall and been
so startled that he lost his footing and top-
pled over into the cut

  olney shouted the brakeman

   will you come to my office in the
morning mr harding asked the super-
intendent as he rose  i shall have word
sent to pratt at once and i believe that as
soon as he knows the truth and that no
supernatural agency produced the vision he
saw he will take a turn for the better

   i am mighty grateful to both of you
for what you have done and the gratitude
of the road will take substantial form
was wales crazy do you think rus
inquired post

   he might have been unbalanced or
simply crazed by drink replied harding
 he has been a bad egg ever since he was
a boy and sank lower and lower until no
one would employ him i think it is more
charitable though to believe him mad than
to assume that he was actuated simply by
a wild desire for revenge

heres one for the tallow-pots what would you be inclined to think if
you had been boosting the gage pretty hard and suddenly looked out
ahead to see the stack of your locomotive glowing red if you can
imagine how you would feel under such conditions you have some idea of the
thoughts that went chasing through donald joness head when he made that
startling discover

    mr seaver also gives us some other tales of sudden surprises which end
rather unpleasantly for the persons who were taken unawares they are the
kind of yarns you hear around the yards the sort of stories that railroad men
want to hear and love to tell

an engine smoke-stack that changed color a green wiper who was
initiated and the peculiar difficulties that a
wandering engineer discovered

well he deserves good luck for any man
who can stick to the old no  and keep
her hot as long as he has deserves all that
is coming to him but whats that got to
do with donald jones

  not very much it is true but in many
respects dennis reminds me of donald
what i started out to tell you was that
dennis getting a road run reminds me of
donald who also went on the road from
the deck of a switcher one of these bally
old saddle-tank mills that causes a runner
to forget his religion nine times a day
but donald was exceptionally lucky for
he got a passenger engine from the jump
he was no tenderfoot when it came to
shoveling coal for he was one of the crack
firemen on the burlington until the strike
of  caught him and put him down
and out

  frank went to the chicago st paul
and kansas city and was firing a switcher
in the main street yards of st joe when
he was given the road-engine and what
he didnt know about firing an engine was
mighty little the boys swore that he


         id you ever meet donald
           jones asked watson as
           spence came in and joined
           the gang around the stove

it seems to me that i
have where did he run  
he fired out of old st joe for a long
time and then got set up the last time
that i heard of him he was riding on the
right side

  a medium-sized smooth-faced rather
good-looking fellow

   he was all of that and was also a
good dresser when he came off his run
you would never suspect him of having just
left his engine after a hard days work
shoveling the black diamonds

   i think i know the man but no
matter what about him

  you know dennis who has been firing
the ten - spot that crazy old switcher that
they have been using here in the yard when
she should have gone to the scrap-heap ten
years ago has been given a road run and
goes out to-night on the 

so-hits the iron on a way-freight
told in the roundhouse



could tell the moment his pick struck a
lump of coal just where it was from-
whether it was leavenworth richmond
rich hill or fort scott coal i do not be-
lieve that he w as really such an expert as
all that but the fact remained that he
could keep the needle on the mark up hill
and down and get over the division with
a smaller coal consumption
than the majority

   just about the time that
donald was given this pas-
senger run the superintend-
ent of motive-power or some
other man who stood pretty
well up toward the top con-
ceived the idea that if the
smoke-stacks of all engines
on the road were painted red
it would not only be a nov-
elty but being somewhat in
the nature of a freak would
cause various and sundry
comments from all sources
with the result that the road
would consequently come in
for some extensive and cheap
advertising

   busenbark was passenger-
traffic manager at the time
and he could give the press-
agent of a minstrel show
cards and spades and then
discount him when it came
to turning out unique and
wonderful advertising stunts

  nowbusenbark may have
been responsible for this red-
stack stunt and he may not

charlie berry assistant gen-
eral freight - agent at st

joseph swore that busenbark
did not know anything about
it and whether charlie was
in the play that got frank
into the snap is not known
to this day though at that
time charlie was something
of a practical joker himself

   but no matter who was responsible
the fact remains that the engine which
donald was called to take out was just
from the shops and came into st joe pull-
ing freight in order to get her legs under
her about eight oclock at night

   owing to a scarcity of motive-power
she was carded for the night run on no 
from st joseph to kansas city due to

leave about  am donald was called
an hour before leaving - time and in the
darkness he did not notice the ensanguined
hue of the stack he swung into the work
and was more intent on learning the old
girls whims and whether she liked a light
or heavy fire best or whether she preferred
bank to level firing by the time he had

these points well worked out it was day-
light and the engine was on the kansas
city northwestern tracks- between leaven-
worth and kansas city when the sun con-
cluded to put in an appearance

   now donalds engineer who i think
was named mcdowell was keeping pretty
close tab on donald

  finally donald swung up on the fire-


the railroad mans magazine

mans box and looked ahead mcdowell
who was watching him while apparently
having eyes for nothing except the track
ahead swears that donald looked rubbed
his eyes then looked again and then
hopped down to the deck and crossing
over to mac said

    whats the matter with the stack 
mac looked ahead and then apparent-
ly much surprised said

    great scott donald what have you
been doing to her that stack is red-hot
thats all

    red-hot nothing how could a stack
twenty feet away from a fire - box and
mounted on the top of a smoke-box at that
get red-hot 

  dont know donald but shes red-
hot all right and its up to you to explain
i see your finish old man

    oh go tell that to the marines what
do you think i am-a corn-field fireman 

donald makes a discovery

    i have always understood that you
were some nuts of a fireman but when you
throw so many hot cinders out of the stack
on your first run that it makes the stack
red-hot why theres bound to be some ex-
planation you know that the old man is
cranky about anything that concerns the
motive-power and when he finds that the
 came into kansas city on her first run

it was not without considerable damage to her temper

with a red-hot stack why theres going to
be something doing-thats all

now donald jones was pretty well up
to all the tricks that are likely to be perpe-
 trated on a green fireman and he-cudgeled
his brains for some time to find an explana-
tion of what kind of a job had been put
up on him

   just as they were coming into old wy-
 andotte and mcdowell had shut her off for
 the station-stop donald threw open the cab
 window and sailed out along the running-
 board his eyes popping

    as the engine came to a stop he stepped
 onto the steam-chest and from there to the
 pilot-beam he could net reach the stack
 from this point but he could see that
 its carmine hue came from paint and not
 from heat

    he said nothing but climbed back into
 the cab and when mac asked him if he
 had found out what was the trouble with
 the stack he merely nodded and said noth-
 ing he had set it up that charlie berry
 and some of the boys at st joseph had put
 up this job on him and he swore that he
 would get even

   at kansas city mac had put tle con
and the rest of the train-crew wise the
con wired berry at st joe to keep up the
play the  was doubled back on no 
and as she pulled into the alain street
depot at st joseph the newsboys were yell-
your red-hots nice fresh
red - hots  but they didnt get a
rise out of frank

  engine  had been cut off and
 set in on the spur north of the
 depot and no  had come in from
 des moines while frank was wash-
 ing up she was pulled by no 
 and her stack too was a vivid red

frank looked at her then at
the stack of his own engine and
throwing aside his towel swung
down crossed over to the  and
hailing the fireman said

   cully i dont know your name
   or where you hail from
   but i want to put you
   wise to the fact that
   the old man wont stand
   for firemen who fire so
   badly that the stack
   gets red-hot

  donald dropped
  down and faded away
  the fireman of 

mg
told in the roundhouse



hailed mcdowell
and said

    whats the mat-
ter with your fire-
man been hitting
em up too-much 

    no hes all
right mac replied
touching his fore-
head  just a little
so-so

    poor man  the
fireman muttered as
he gazed after the
sturdy figure swing-
ing down the street

but no one ventured
to mention anything
to frank about
throwing red-hot cin-
ders out of the stack
after that

  that reminds
mehank remarked

 of the early days
on thetron moun-
tain during the la-
ter seventies and the
early eighties there
was a lively gang
running on that road
especially on the bel-
mont division from
bismarck to bel-
mont

  fredericktown was then the division-
point between st louis and belmont and
though it had a population of only two or
three thousand a large proportion of these
were railroaders - mostly young fellows
and full of the old nick

breaking in the beginners

  the height of ambition of the average
farmer lad in madison county was to get
a job railroading and the ranks of the
wipers at the fredericktown roundhouse
were constantly recruited from this source
some of the boys failed tomake good but
as a rule those who entered the service of
the company as wipers gradually got on the
road as firemen and with few exceptions
they turned out to be good men

  it was only natural that all kinds of
tricks would be played upon the beginners
and the stunts that crowd couldnt think of
to make life a burden to the embryo fire-

                    man were not worth
 considering

   o a haynes
 was master me-
 chanic and the main
 shops were at caron-
 delet a suburb of
 st louis haynes
 was not very favor-
 ably impressed with
 the capacities for
 devilment that were
 exhibited by the
 gang and whenever
 he had an oppor-
 tunity he came down
 hard on the offend-
 er jerry phalen got
 ten days once for
 causing a kid wiper
 to spend half a day
 of the companys
 time chasing around
 the town in search
 of a left- handed
 monkey-wrench he
 having assured the
 lad that it was im-
 possible to set the
 valves on the left
 side of  without
 this wrench and un-
 less the valves were
 set the engine- could
 not go out on her run

 the  was pulling passenger on the
north end between st louis and frederick-
town and she was due to leave on no 
about one-thirty in the afternoon it was
about eight in the morning that he sent the
kid out on the chase

 well jerry was making good money
and the lay-off did not phase him to any
great extent he dead-headed back to fred-
ericktown on no  and put in the time
during his lay-off in studying up tricks to be
played and sending the wipers on all kinds
of impossible stunts

the eagle eye his hero

   a lad of about sixteen whose parents
resided at mine la motte was inoculated
with the railroad fever and was determined
to become an engineer he had hung about
the roundhouse lending a hand whenever
occasion offered until one of the wipers
having been sent out firing caused a va-

 you call that playin marbles eh  


the railroad mans magazine

cancy and the roundhouse-foreman gave the
kid the vacant job

  now in the eyes of this boy the man
who rode on the right side of an engine pull-
ing a passenger-train at the reckless speed
of thirty miles an hour was a bigger man
than general grant who was then president
of the united states and consequently
some  punkins while the fireman who kept
her hot ranked head and shoulders above
a united states senator therefore the
faintest wish expressed by an engineer was
law and gospel to this lad

getting the goat

   he was a hard worker anxious to
please and determined to make good but
all this was not known to the gang until
later else his initiation might have been
less strenuous

  the kid got his job just about the time
that jerry drifted in from st louis on his
lay-off and of course was at once marked
down as a likely victim bob and joe mc-
quade engineers and a number of firemen
were in the roundhouse some of the fire-
men were rubbing up the brasswork on the
engines while the heggers busied themselves
tinkering about their pets

   i have previously said something about
the goat that used to hang out around the
roundhouse billy came strolling along the
edge of the turntable-pit keeping the gang
on the keen edge of expectancy of seeing him
tumble overboard but managing to keep on
the right side all the time and as soon as
jerry spied the goat an unholy desire seized
him to press that goat and the kid into a
stunt that would make sport for the gang

  so he called the kid and told him to
catch billy and take him over to the rail-
road hotel and tell the landlady that jerry
phalen had sent him to get the harness and
the little express wagon and when he had
billy hitched up to drive him to the round-
house and they would tell him what to do

  now engine no  had just pulled out
of the roundhouse to go out on her run and
the wipers had just finished washing out
the pit in her stall these pits were laid
with brick floors-cement not then having
come into general use for these purposes-
and the foreman was particularly cranky
on the subject of dirty pits

  the kid caught the goat and managed
to pull him across the street to the railroad
hotel now as at least seventy-five per

cent of the railroaders who ran in and out
of fredericktown boarded at this place the
-landlady was inclined to let them have the
moon if they wanted it and she could
manage to get it for them so when the kid
and the goat hove in sight at the alley-gate
and the kid had managed to get billy in-
side not without considerable exertion and
determination on the part of the kid she
tumbled at once that the gang had some-
thing on and that there would be something
doing in short order

    so when the breathless lad told her
what was wanted she not only produced
the articles but assisted in harnessing billy
despite his protestations but it was not
without considerable damage to her temper
and a long rent in her red-flannel petticoat
that the angry goat was at last securely
harnessed in the shafts

   unknown to johnnie the kid and the
widow their performance of harnessing the
goat had not been without witnesses as
soon as the kid and the goat had disappeared
in the alley back of the hotel the back yard
of which was surrounded by a high board-
fence-too high to see over-the gang
promptly strolled across the street and lined
up alongside the fence where convenient
cracks and knot-holes afforded an unob-
structed view of the rear yard of the hotel

   the gang kept quiet with difficulty it
was an exceedingly hard task to witness
the ground and lofty tumbling indulged in
by the widow the kid and the goat without
shouting

   when johnnie showed up with billy
duly harnessed and banged over the rails
into the house the gang was innocently en-
gaged in swapping yams

obeying orders

    jerry took the lad and his goat-outfit
back of the roundhouse to the cinder-pile
and told him to fill up the wagon with cin-
ders haul it into the roundhouse and spread
it over the floor of the pit in the vacant stall
about two inches deep and to work fast for
it was necessary that this floor should be
covered before another engine was set into
that stall the men needed the cinders to
stand on and avoid wetting their feet while
the boilers were being washed out

    jerry impressed upon the lad the neces-
sity of working quickly and to have the job
done if possible before the foreman returned

    bill was inclined to be obstreperous
told in the roundhouse

but johnnie was not made of the stuff that
would lie down to a billy-goat in a short
time he had the goat pulling the wagon as
sedately as any old mule the boy worked
fast and when the foreman finally broke
away and wandered over to that part of the
house he was dumfounded and speechless
for a moment here was the floor of his

came down in the barrel doubled up like a
jack-knife his head and feet alone appear-
ing over the top

this was too much for jerry and he
intervened

thatll do you now murphy dont
touch that boy again

 then murphy turned on him he

pit that he had always kept as clean as a
parlor covered with cinders

  then johnnie with his goat-wagon
came in with another load which he proceed-
ed to dump into that pit

johnnie gets another goat

  here what arc you doing there lie
yelled

  the kid looked up without pausing
in his work he quietly ejaculated  what
dye think playing marbles 

you call that playin marbles eh 

   the foreman seized the lad by the col-
lar of his jacket lifting him clean from the
floor with the toe of his number ten brogans
he sent him flying through the air

engine  a mogul was in the next
stall on her pilot-deck she carried a bar-
rel filled with dry sand johnnie described
a graceful parabola through the air and
 rr

called jerry everything but a gentleman
threatened to report the matter to haynes
by wire with a request that whenever jerry
was laid off in the future that haynes
should see to it that he was locked up some
place where he would be unable to play any
tricks during his lay-off

  well outside of all that im a good
fellow aint i have a cigar said jerry
after murphys trimming

   murphy glared at him while the surging
blood congested in his face until it was
almost purple and the veins on his neck
stood out he gurgled a moment in a futile
effort to say something and then turned on
his heels and strode away while the gang
yelled and howled until the city marshal
who was at the depot awaiting the arrival
of no  came running at full speed to see
what had broken loose in the roundhouse

  from that day johnnie was the es-
special protege of the enginemen he soon

  saw her drop some of it into a cup of coffee

 boxes run hot standing on the sidings never
 felt such heat

   thats all right jack but this crowds
 been on earth almost nine months fill
 your pipe and spiel i know youve got a
 story somewhere

jack frasers story

   well mike to tell the truth i had an
 experience shortly after i began running
 down there that i will not soon forget of
 course little willie was only a looker-on
 in vienna but she was sure hot stuff while
 she was running

    ill bet a cookie theres a woman in it
 spence muttered

   safe bet you win said jack

    there generally is said fox

    sure else how would a billy-goat get
 a red-flannel petticoat to flag down the st

   thats all right watson fox replied

  you can bet your bottom dollar that a red
 flag stops me at any time and any place
 humph now i know why you have
 never got married

    good boy you know more than any
 one else then but this is not listening to
 jacks story

   well then for pure cool unadulterated
 nerve the fellow that i am going to tell you
 about takes the whole bake-shop and then
 some nine men out of ten would have gone
 up in the air and began shooting instead of
 coolly lying down and waiting until he got
 the guilty party dead to rights it was only
 by an accident that i happened in for the
 last act of the drama

    we were going west pulling fast freight
when the old girl got tired lifted her trucks
climbed the rail and laid down gently on
her left side in a little three-foot cut on
the outside of a curve between sabinal and
uvalde it doesnt often rain in that coun-
try but when it does it rains and then
rains

into the ditch

   when the old girl began to swing i
yelled to hank busby my fireman to hit
the grit i just caught a glimpse of him
swinging out of the gangway on the left
side as  went overboard on the right i
lit on my knees rammed my head in the
soft muddy bank turned a somersault and
lit on top of the bank still rolling i hap-
pened to be on the down-hill side and the
hill was pretty steep so i kept on going
for the very good reason that i couldnt
stop

   i landed in the bottom of one of them
infernal arroyos that never carry water ex-
cept in rainy weather i got to my feet and
my first impression was that it had been
raining box-cars for the way the twenty
boxes in that train were scattered over the
landscape was scandalous

   how they managed to be strewn around
so promiscuously and none of them catching
me is a mystery

  i climbed up the hill and when i got
back to the right-of-way i saw the way-car
still on the rails not even scratched and
the con was still perched up in the look-
out

   i wondered why he did not get out of
that but just then the rest of the crew
came straggling in busby was the only
one that was hurt and his left hand and
arm were badly scratched and torn where
he had plowed through some briers the
three brakemen had been sitting together
on top of a box car when the car rose right
up without any warning and dumped them
all out on the prairie among the buffalo-
grass and cactus

the con gets caught

   we yelled at the con to wake up and
get out of that and he said that he couldnt
unless we came and helped him pry himself
loose

    we hustled into the way-car and climbed
up into the lookout the con had been sit-
ting with one leg bent back between his
told in the roundhouse

now mount those ponies and git both of you

chair and the edge of the coaming and the
shock had twisted his chair and bent the
iron standard so that the corner was
jammed into the wooden coaming catching-
a fold of the cons trousers and driving it
into the wood

  the cloth was strong and he was held
as securely as though he had been nailed
there we had to take a knife and cut
a section out of his trousers-leg before he
could get away

  we had clean forgot about flagging
the wreck but that was the first tiling the
con thought of and the way that he jumped
those brakeys was a caution they hunted
up their flags and fuses and hustled out
there was nothing due there for two mortal
hours from either direction but that con
wasnt going to take any chances

   i went ahead and looked at the en-
gine the old girl was still purring but
as i had shut the throttle before i jumped
she wasnt tearing up the soil any she had
rammed her nose into the soft muddy
bank of die cut but as far as i could see
aside from smashing the cab windows on the
left side she was apparently all ready to
go whenever she was set back on the rails

foraging for food

  there was nothing for me to do so i
began to think of foraging for chuck i
started for a grove of mesquit about half a
mile away and just beyond i found a dobe

house i knocked at the door and a woman
came in answer to the summons

   before i had time to say anything about
grub she squealed

  oh thank heaven you have come
my husband has taken poison and is dying
i have  one to leave while i go for help
will you stay with him and watch while i
go for help  

  there was nothing else to do so i an-
swered that i would she led the way into
the house where a man was lying on the
floor with his head on a pillow with a
quilt thrown over him his face was death-
ly white great beads of sweat stood on his
forehead and he was breathing deeply and
heavily in a way that looked to me as though
each breath would be his last

plot to poison

   the woman went a moment later i
heard the clatter of a ponys hoofs i sat
down and listened to the sound as long as i
could then i turned around to look at the
dying man he was sitting up as he
caught my eye he said 

    quick hand me that club behind
the door that woman will be back here
in a few moments and i want to be ready

   i went to the door and found the club
he laid it beside him under the quilt then
he said

    my wife and a sheep man living about
a mile from here have become altogether
s

the railroad mans magazine

too friendly and for some time i have
believed that they were plotting to get
me out of the way i have watched her for
some time and a few days ago she brought
home a bottle of laudanum to-day i saw
her drop some of it into a cup of coffee while
i was washing

    she went out to the kitchen to bring
in the victuals and i chucked the coffee
out of the window and filled the cup
with fresh coffee then i pretended that
i was going under knowing that she would
get word to the fellow some way now
when you hear them coming cover me over
from head to foot and let them think that
i died while she was away then stand by
and youll see some fun

   in an incredibly short space of time i
heard the rat-a-rat-atat rat-atat-rat-atal of
two ponies coming at a gallop i drew the
cover over the  dead  man a moment la-
ter the woman rushed in at the door fol-
lowed by a low-browed squat stockily built
fellow whose face bore the stamp of a cow-
ard and all-around tough

disposing of the  remains

   i wondered what any woman could see
in such a geezer

    as she came in she asked

     is he dead  

   i simply nodded i couldnt speak it
was none of my funeral anyway i noticed
the woman look at the man and a look
of exultation showed plainly on his face
though he tried to keep his face lowered

  they went to the side of the dead man
standing side by side she tried to lift the
quilt but could not the man stooped over
and lifted it

   then the dead man became suddenly
very much alive and the way that he made
the sliillalah play over that fellows head and
shoulders was a caution

   when the husband thought that he had
welted the man good and plenty he started
after his wife but she was safely out of
doors

   the husband grabbed the sheep man
by the scruff of the neck and pitched him

out through the door then he dashed a
bucket of cold water over him and as he sat
up gasping and gagging he said

     now mount those ponies and git both
of you dont wait for your traps for you
wont get any but git and git quick and
dont either of you ever cross my path 

a revengeful  corpse

   the sheep man scrambled to the back
of his pony after a fashion but the woman
had already mounted and was dashing
down the trail at a gallop the  dead 
man looked after them for an instant

   turning to me he said

    stranger i am mightily obleeged to
ye what mought your business be 

   i told him that i was a locomotive en-
gineer and that my engine was on her side
at the head of a wrecked train not far away
that i had started ouf to locate a ranch-
house to secure some chuck for myself and
the crew for we could not tell how long
we might be laid out there

   he stretched out his hand saying

   shake stranger i knowed ye was a
white man when i fust seed ye if its
chuck ye want ye are welcome to what ive
got and as much as ye need

   he led the way out to the chuck-wagon
we found it well supplied with coffee sugar
hard-tack bacon potatoes and some canned
fruits and vegetables he hitched up the
wagon and bidding me mount beside him
drove across the prairie to the wreck where
the boys had begun to consult as to the
advisability of sending a tracer after me
the con had started back on a ten - mile
tramp to sabina to wire a report of the
wreck

   the cattleman unhitched building a
fire from some of the splinters of the wreck-
age he soon had coffee boiling and bacon
frying

   this with some hard-tack and canned
fruits made a meal fit for any one to say
nothing of a gang of half-starved rail-
pounders

ded into that mans chuck

 bakers bailiwick

ibw aker had lived the greater part
of his forty years in that sec-
ksv tion of the primeval west which
ifrjrrr	earest settlers called the

 mtsls bad lands and which later
travelers have dubbed with a
more forcible and less polite appellation
baker horse thief desperado train robber
had learned to love the bad lands he
had learned to love them for the particular
reason that on divers occasions if he had
migrated to a more civilized country he
would have run a desperate risk of being
made the occupant of a dungeon

  that we may get better acquainted with
baker let us first get well acquainted with
his habitat bad lands is the name ap-
plied to the arid regions of the west where
there are long barren sun-baked areas of
hills and ridges broken by numerous gullies
and deep ravines the principal stretches
are in the western dakota and central
wyoming

  the big bad lands of the western part
of south dakota and east of the black
hills is an area of about two thousand
square miles it consists largely of unpro-
ductive land that form expansive basins in
the plateaus bordering the white and chey-
enne rivers

 the scenery is wild and wonderful



there are ridges and mesas running to a
height of nearly four hundred feet eroded
by the subtle and untiring hand of nature
into all manner of fantastic shapes

  ravines and canons cut them into an
endless variety of rugged buttresses and
pinnacles this phalanx of serried grandeur
is chiefly composed of sandy clay and lime-
stone of a light color when the sun is
shining at its brightest the bare slopes re-
flect a light that is hard to penetrate-and
wo to him whose eyes are weak

   there is an occasional fall of rain but
the limestone is so very dry and the gullies
so deep the water is sapped up and vanishes
before vegetation can establish itself

   however there are places where the rain
falls in abundance and vegetation is as pro-
lific as it is queer one of those places was
an abandoned settlement-one of those
many  camps  of the west where fearless
pioneers located thinking that there was
nothing to do but dig from the earth the
metal that would make them rich but
like so many similar expeditions the one
that settled on the spot of earth where this
story is laid had passed into time

   there was flurry for a while tents and
rude cabins were set up holes were dug
women suffered hardships that their hus-
bands might prosper children were born-
but there was no gold as soon as this fact
became evident to all the settlers picked up
their belongings folded their tents and
silently stole away


the railroad mans magazine

  hunted like a wolf driven from county
to county from hiding-place to hiding-
place baker at length came to the aban-
doned settlement he wandered through
its deserted avenues aimlessly going from
house to house-if i may be permitted to
dignify the crude weatherbeaten huts that
dotted the side of a hill as such

  be that as it may when baker driven
from place to place by an army of paid pur-
suers cleverly evaded them and rode his
horse to death in mad flight and finally
reached this abandoned settlement it looked
as good to him as the middle of broadway
would look to one who suddenly found him-
self marooned on a desert isle

  the horse had dropped from under him
some miles back in the early hours of the
morning baker had ridden that night
he had ridden as few men had ever ridden
before

  he knew that his only claim to safety
was to put as much territory as possible
between him and the men who were pur-
suing him

  it vas a case of driving him into the
w ilderness that he realized as the country
through which he was passing grew new
and strange and the more fertile areas
turned slowly into the brown and gray ap-
proaches of the great and lonesome region
of the bad lands

  on the night before baker had some
sort of a hunch that it was up to him to
make one grand spurt he surmised that his
pursuers wherever they might be would
sleep that night

  he had given them a  run for their
money  during the day and he had found
a convenient gulley where there was food
and water for his horse

  of course none of the occupants knew
him when he appeared at a miners cabin
just before sundown and asked for food

  news did not travel fast or far in that
country the story of the hold-up of the
pacific coast special the fastest and smart-
est train on the c g asd g twelve miles
out of dead gulch single handed by a
lone bandit had not penetrated any faster
than the posse that was following baker
could spread the sensation

   what did he get away with   asked
the wide-eyed as the news was told them

  twenty thousand that was being ship-
ped to a bank in oregon  exclaimed the
leader of the posse

  bills or cash asked one fool

  bills you jackass was the answer
 how far could you pack twenty thousand
in gold with a posse chasing you eh  thi-
baby didnt leave no trail of twenty-dollar
gold pieces by which we could find him
he got away with the long green and hes
got it on him at that 

  who was it asked another

   baker of the bad lands

  then everybody smiled baker of the
bad lands was a name to conjure with in
that part of the world it had been given
to him because he knew that desolate region
better perhaps than any other man 
earth except the officers of the united states
geological sun-ey or the fossil-hunlers who
infested the ravines and the plateaus at
various times digging for the remains of the
animals that thrived there in the eocene
age

  yes baker knew the bad lands he
knew that few posses wanted to chase men
into their peculiar and uninviting vast-
nesses so when the miners family had
given him a square meal and his horse
seemed refreshed he mounted and cantered
slowly along the road until the moon rose
over the hill and showed him the way-
clear and distinct

  then he put his spurs deep into the ani-
mals already scarred and bleeding flanks
gave its head a mighty tug with the bridle-
reins and urged it to top speed

  i dont know how far the dogs are be-
hind me said baker half aloud to himself
 they may be on my trail-right back of
me-and they may be god knows where
but if it is a case of horseor man-the man
is going to win 

  he dashed on and on and on into the
bright night ever and anon he would pull
up his panting horse to listen

  ever and anon he would urge him to
greater speed with spur and bridle-rein
he almost had him winded several times-
but that made no matter-that horse had to
get him to the farthest point in the quickest
possible time

  once-and only once-the animal stop-
ped still and refused to budge all of
bakers urging and beating could not break
that fit of balking the horse had made up
his mind

  he was not going a step farther until he
regained his wind baker gave him a
chance he gave him several bourse all
that time he stood  his feet and listened
-listened with his ears strained for the
baker of the bad lands



slightest sound that might come through
the mighty silence of the night

  his right hand rested on the holster of his
trusty six-gun his left held his chargers
reins his eyes pierced the far stretches
made bright and perceptible by the moon
he was looking for shadows-but more
keenly he scanned the sky-line of the hills
to the west momentarily expecting that
some horseman would gallop silently into
view

  now and then he would relinquish the
hold on his six-gun and tenderly press a
leather bag that hung from his right shoul-
der and snuggled under his left side next
to his skin

  although he knew the bag was there he
vanted to be doubly sure he wanted to
feel it every little while he wanted to be
certain that it was safe he wanted to do
more than that he wanted to sort of squeeze
its sides and feel the bundle of bills that
rested therein

  as he felt them this time he smiled
twenty thousand dollars twenty thou-
sand dollars

  egad that was a sum that was a
haul which should make any hold-up man
feel proud why that was sufficient with
which to retire from the game

  retire from the game the very idea of
it seemed to have come upon him like a
flash in the night the hope the possibili-
ty of-

  a clattering metallic sound broke his
musing

  sure as the heavens above him he heard
it-but it did not come a second time he
listened with suspended breath he was
positive that he heard it

  however the horse still nibbled the short
grass by the roadside in its placid way and
did not rear its head and prick up its ears
as horses had so often done on previous oc-
casions when he was being chased by men
giving evidence of their approach when he
could- not hear a sound

  baker was not a man to take chances
jumping into the saddle he spurred on
again this time there was to be no stop
baker was as sure as death that he had
heard the hoofs of his pursuers horses
that was sufficient

  the more he puzzled over the sound the
more certain he was that he had to get
further into the bad lands he thanked his
luck that the moon was so bright and the
way so clear to lie sure he had never

been in this particular ridge of the hills be-
fore-but the formation of the land the
peculiar and unmistakable sheen of the rid-
ges were as an alphabet to him

  he gave his horse no chance for rest again
that night on and on he flew-on and on
through the night - the animals flanks
white with foam its neck and head stretch-
ed its hoofs beating such a regular clatter
on the roadway that baker could tell just
when its speed was diminishing

  whenever this became evident baker
would administer the spurs all the more
what meant a horse when his liberty and
twenty thousand dollars were at stake

  the horse struck a rock stumbled
plunged head forward and fell baker
made a dive into the dust and scraped along
for a dozen feet he was too good a rider
to get hurt and he quickly picked himself
up and ran to the horse

   get up  said baker sharply as he
dug his boot-toein the animals belly

  the animal did not move the reckless
rider had ridden him to death

chapter ii

the deserted settlement

daker did not stop the horse dead
lie must of choice take to his feet
so on he went leaving the dead animal to
the vultures or the posse or whichever or
whatever would first find it

  on and on walked the hunted man on
and on through the night and the early
dawn until at length he found himself in
the abandoned mining-camp

  tired as he was he began to explore
the place from general observation it was
evident that the place was deserted-but he
wanted to be sure this one looked just
like the dozen or more deserted camps
that he had come across at various stages
of his career but perhaps there was some
recluse passing his days in a cabin or
some prospector who still believed in the
place occupying one of the dried-up tumble-
downs

  baker went from cabin to cabin and
peered in if a cabin happened to have
more than one room he entered and made
a complete search not only this but he
walked around each one and peered under
the porches where porches were still visible

  he even searched the remaining barns
and outhouses but except for himself there


the railroad mans magazine

was absolutely no sign of life save for an
occasional snake that disturbed in its sunny
peace for the first time in years scampered
to safety under the rocks a few lizards that
had come from their crevices to warm them-
selves in the early morning sun and a pair
of buzzards that circled far above him

  the abandoned camp was riot run ram-
pant empty tomato cans kerosene-oil
tins empty bottles and the bones of aban-
doned animals bleached white by the sun
littered the streets along which the thirty
or more huts were irregularly arranged

  there were no footprints to show him that
man had been there before the winds
had covered up all such traces

  the limestone hills of the bad lands
looming far to the east added to the gray-
ness and the gloom if a more lonesome
place existed on earth baker could not have
found it

  but he was glad inwardly he rejoiced
and was glad it was just the place of all
place for him had he been given free
transportation after making away with the
twenty thousand he would have chosen just
that spot as his destination

  looking over the huts with critical eye
lie chose one about the center of the camp
for his dwelling-place

   in his tour of inspection he had noticed
this one particularly there was a bed in-
side on which was a time-worn mattress
covered with dirt and dust-but still a
mattress

  strewn about the floor were several
blankets and some old clothing a broken
mirror in which his face looked tangled and
awry because the heat had distorted the
mercury still held its place on the wall

  but-better than all this the original
tenants had planted a truck-garden at the
rear-and now the sun and the rain and a
gushing spring had made the desert blossom
as a rose

  the vegetables were growing at will
twining their tendrils onto each others stalks
the supply seemed plentiful and baker
thanked his luck again

   he searched the other huts until he found
the dilapidated remains of a broom in a
short time the baker mansion was swept
clear of the accumulated dust of years
spider-webs were torn from the rafters
centipedes were sent scurrying to other quar-
ters the blankets were taken out and beaten
the bed was propped up the mattress
knocked into respectability and comfortable

proportions and the old clothing hung on
the pegs behind a door that resisted all effort
at closing

  baker was very much more at home than
he had been for some time

  having been either on foot or in a saddle
for some twenty-eight hours he was now
ready for sleep he took off his boots that
his tired feet might relax placed them with-
in close proximity of the bed felt his leather
bag took the six-gun from its resting-place
and with his finger on the trigger he lay
him down to sleep

  it was still daylight when he awoke al-
though the rest had made his body stiff
and sore he was nevertheless unwilling to
stay abed longer

  first of all there was the money he
wanted to take a good look at it the
frightened messenger who had thrown out
the strong-box when baker held up the
train had told him that it was hardly worth
the taking but baker had heard such stories
from messengers before

  when he had ordered the train on its way
and taken the strong-box to a convenient
place and opened it he was not surprised
to find the messenger mistaken or else per-
haps in other circles the twenty thousand
dollars in bills of husky denominations was
a mere bagatelle

  baker wanted to take a look at his money
he wanted to hold it in his hands count
it over and over again press it to his cheek
and inhale the peculiar odor that distin-
guishes a well-worn bank-note he wanted
to revel in his new-found wealth he
wanted to paw it over until his hands were
tired of the worn crispiness of the notes
and then he would put them to one side
like a cat tired of her kittens

  he went to the door and looked out on
the landscape he scanned the horizon he
ran his eye over the tree tops he looked into
the valley below and he even looked into
several of the empty houses

  there was not a soul in sight he was
as much alone as ever returning to the
place that he had elected as his abode he
entered and plumped himself on the bed
tailor-fashion

  unbuttoning his shirt he reached for the
strap that held the leather bag in place
and unhooked it the bag was wet with-
the moisture of his body and as he opened
it and took out his fortune he marveled how
much a part of him it all seemed

  then he reveled in the money counting
i

baker of the bad lands



and recounting it he piled it up in various
piles according to its denomination he
looked at the date of issue of each he read
the numbers he marveled what a story each
note could tell if its wanderings could be
recorded

  he held them up to the light he turned
ithem over he smoothed them out and
counted them again he put them to his
lips and kissed them-for they were his
all he had risked his life for them he
had been chased into the wilderness for
them-and they were all all his

  he piled them one on one carefully tied
them with a piece of twine laid them gently
in the snug recesses of the bag and fastened
the strap to his body as he did so he
thanked his luck-which was playing him
a splendid game this time-that all the bills
showed signs of usage that was good

   those spick span new bills said baker
to himself  are always dangerous every
time you layone of them down the fellow
who takes it looks at you as if you had stolen
it but with these old ones it always looks
as if you had carried em for a long time-
been sort of industrious and saving as it
were

chapter iii

the lonesome capitalist

all of the facts that have been narrated
in the preceding chapters happened
during that month of the year when spring
is well on its way and summer is already
announced by warmth and blossom and the
enlivening doings of the wild things

  baker was also very glad of that what-
ever he had to look forward to a winter in
that desolate spot with its chilly winds and
rains and bleak surroundings was more
than even the sudden possessor of twenty
thousand dollars could stand

  but all through the summer and the
glorious autumn he would live the life of a
gentleman-so far as it was possible of
course-and by the time winter had begun
to show its teeth then the disappearance of
baker of the bad lands with twenty thou-
sand from the pacific coast special would
have pretty well melded into the ages

   the sleuths would be tired of looking for
him the reward that would undoubtedly be
placed on his head would become forgotten
other train robberies and other deeds of
desperate men would be occupying the greedy

newspapers and the craving minds of the
public-and then he could go forth a free

man

  a free man

  he spent the rest of the day in rum-
maging around the weather-worn cabins un-
til he had accumulated a rusty and battered
stove he also unearthed a stew-pan that
was bent and battered and which the ero-
sions of time was quickly turning to rust
a large spoon also turning to rust  several
smaller pans of equal decay three empty
tins a knife that was in a fair state of
preservation for it had been wrapped in
several pieces of cloth and stuck in a
drawer

  in another house he found a table he
carried this and the stove and various kitch-
en utensils into the cabin just next door to
his he had plenty of room and why not
have the kitchen removed from the house
the smell of cooking was none too pleasant
at any rate

  the stove had only one leu instead of
searching for the other three baker knocked
off the remaining one and let it rest on its
bottom on the floor having accomplished
this he realized the importance of having
an ax and one or two other tools to put the
stove-pipe in place

  baker started out in quest of these things
he did not find an ax but he found a mis-
erable apology for a chisel a dozen screws
a wooden mallet and a coil of wire he
added all of them to his stock noticing
a piece of stove-pipe jutting from the roof
a cabin not far from his own he wended
his way thither and wrenched it loose

  he had to be pretty careful for the metal
was in the last stages of decay stove-
piping seemed pretty scarce but with this
length he could at least get his stove in
working order

  he moved the stove against the window
and deftly arranged the pipe so that it point-
ed outward in order to accomplish this
he had to turn the stove slightly on one end
one or two blocks under the stove held it in
place and the wire served well to keep the
pipe -from leaning out so far that it was
liable to lose its balance

  the next thing to do was to get stove-
lids and yet that could wait until he had
his pots and pans in order taking the
largest pot to a point of vantage back of
the kitchen baker beat it with the mallet
and scraped it with the chisel until the rust
began to disappear


the railroad mans magazine

  the metal was pretty far gone however

it was like trying to save wood that had
been burned in a lire he scraped and
pounded the tin vessel until it showed some
of its pristine glory then he placed it on
the stove filled it with water from the
spring and proceeded to light a fire

  baker was too old a desperado not to
know the simple method of producing fire
by friction with his knife a piece of flint
which he always carried and some of the
dry sticks which littered the place he soon
had a good fire in the old stove

  soon the water was boiling and eating
away the rust baker supplied more water
and as it came to the boiling-point he scraped
the sides of the pan with a stick applying
the power that lay back of his muscles

  in a short time the pot was in a present-
able shape though battered and worn it
was clean and would do for cooking he
placed it in the sun for a few minutes while
he gathered more wood and it was not long
before the pot was again on the stove serving
as a bath-tub for the smaller utensils which
were boiled and scraped until baker had
quite a respectable dining-layout

  the stove needed four lids but two would
suffice for the present baker went on an-
other foraging trip this time he found
a lid that was much too large for the stove
in his kitchen but which would answer
every purpose a few feet further he found
the tin cover of a miners dinner-bucket
this would also serve as a stove-lid with
the aid of a stone to keep it in place

  he filled his large pot with clean water
and put it on to boil the sun was begin-
ning to dip low toward the west and the 
cool breeze that ushers in evening was com-
ing up from the lowlands it was nearly
time for his dinner

  he went into the vegetable garden and
pulled up three large well-formed potatoes
a beet and two parsnips these would be
sufficient perhaps it would be best to go
sparingly with the viands-they would have
to last him for months

  he washed them and scraped them and
put them on to boil he stood ovaf them
with the air of a chef as the water bubbled
and foamed now and then he prodded
the vegetables with his knife they taxed
his patience a bit when they did not soften
as quickly as he anticipated and he won-
dered if all things took so long to prepare
for the table

  finally the meal was before him on a

tin platter on the rough table with the an-
cient spoon to aid he sat him down and in
all his life nothing ever tasted quite so good

  as he ate he lacked but one thing he
thought-that ever necessary staple salt it
is wonderful what the palate demands for
a while baker thought that if he had to
dwell in that place without salt he would
go mad but then he remembered the stories
he had heard of the men who crossed the
rockies with fremont who put gunpowder
on their food in lieu of salt and found it
pretty good at that

  he also remembered having read another
article by a famous chinese diplomat who
held that eating salt was only a habit and
a very bad habit at that the air we
breathe the food itself the water in which
it is cooked all contain a sufficient amount
of salt to satisfy the wants of any man and
the promiscuous application of it to ones
food is dangerous

      chapter iv
      his house in order

tphe meal finished baker cleaned up
his pots and pans brushed off the
table and began the task of putting his
house in order that it needed yellow soap
water and elbow grease was more than evi-
dent

  baker could easily supply the water and
the elbow grease and in place of soap he
used the fine sand that lie scraped up from
the dilapidated  streets and a piece of
soft sand-stone filling his largest pail
with water this modern crusoe got down on
all fours rolled up his sleeves and went
at it

  the baker mansion was quickly trans-
formed into a spick and span frontier cabin

  early the next morning like the crusoe
of renown baker strolled about to get better
acquainted with his circumjacence he
climbed to a high knoll which commanded
a good view of the deserted camp and the
surrounding country

  baker took it all in keenly from his in-
timate knowledge of that part of the world
he realized that he was at the outer edge
of the bad lands and that it would be safer
to remain where he was than move in any
direction

  to the east and north of him lay die im-
passable and inhospitable bad lands to
the west and south the open country
baker of the bad lands



  he could see the flaming posters now be-
ing nailed to every available tree and fence-
post and country store offering perhaps
five thousand dollars for the return of his
body-dead or alive he could see the
mounted sheriffs and their daring men dash-
ing hither and yon on foam-flecked steeds
at every little breath of a rumor think-
ing a hanged sight more of the reward than
of him how easily he had fooled them

  they would not think of following him
into the bad lands they would surmise
that no train robber no matter how clever
or daring with twenty thousand dollars in
his kit would risk his life in those unin-
viting wastes thats the way they would
look at it-so baker surmised

  he stretched himself at length on a rock
and watched the sun glint to silver the spires
of the lime-stone peaks crowning the vast
region to his right he pulled his hat down
to shadow his eyes gave the bag containing
his fortune a hitch so that it would not jab
into his side-and the whole world was his

  a lizard darted from its home in the
rocks-close by scrambled up to the side of
a boulder some six feet away and began to
blink in the delight of its morning sun-
bath

  baker watched it closely and began to
scheme the vegetable diet might pall and
lie wondered if a bit of roast lizard woidd
not vary his menu

  he had read in that same wonderful nar-
rative of fremont how the indians that ac-
costed his party when he was crossing from
california to the east would drag lizards
from their holes with crooked sticks roast
them alive over a fire and eat them with
marvelous relish

   well whats good enough for a fine
indian is good enough for me said baker
and he realized that when men are hungry
it matters little what they eat so long as
something edible heaves in sight

  he glanced down over the irregular rows
of cabins and was surprised to observe a
green patch behind a projecting ledge about
three hundred feet from his own front door
rising to his feet he circled the neighbor-
hood with his eyes

  he had involuntarily formed this habit
before moving from one point to another
if the change of base were only a few feet
baker took that precaution just why he
did not know he thought it the safest
thing to do

  the lizard surprised at the presence of

so queer a living thing disappeared as if by
magic and baker with light and agile step
darted down the rock walked glibly past
his own door and turned the ledge of rock
that disclosed to his view the green patch
he had noticed a little while before

   before his eyes were half an acre of oasis
-some dwarfed pepper-trees a scant wil-
low a stretch of tall tough grass queer
hardy plants with scentless flowers of a dull
yellow hue and-best of all-several gush-
ing springs that poured forth a volume of
cool clear water and sent it down into a
canon to find its way to some river or back
into the earth again

   baker stooped over one of the springs and
drank deep of its flowing coolness

   luck and still more luck  he ex-
claimed aloud

  here was water in abundance not only
would he have sufficient-with the spring
behind his house-for cooking and washing
and drinking but here he would hollow out
a natural tub so to speak and every morn-
ing have a plunge that any man might envy

  he walked around the outer edge of his
new-found paradise under the most spread--
ing of the willows he was surprised to see
a rough pine board which the hand of man
had thrust into the ground

  it was a piece of fence-board gray and
weather-worn and rough-but it marked the
only grave in that wild stretch of desolation

  baker approached it querulously he
knew that it had been put there to mark
some passing event in the former life of the
town and a queer little lump came into his
throat as he read this epitaph which had
been rudely carved with a knife

  emily age 

  that was all baker looked appealingly
at the grave and wondered what sort of a
story that piece of board could tell if it
could only speak

   poor little emily left alone in that speck
of a paradise in the most lonesome region of
the west who was her father and who
her mother what dread disease took her
away where were her parents now did
they ever think of that little grave which
the cruel winds of winter had leveled to tae
ground leaving only the modest memorial
that such miscreants as he might not dese-
crate a grave

  baker was not without sentiment though
a desperate man who held life cheap and
knew no fear-this resting-place of a child
went dee into his heart


the railroad mans magazine

  he would not be so lonesome with little
emily to think of now and then he
would come often to the willow-tree and
as time wore on he would build a head-
stone of rock with his own hands-a head-
stone that would last and defy the elements

  and he would carve her name thereon
-aye he had the chisel and the mallet with
which to do it and the time even if
it took the long summer through he would
see that emilys grave was marked by a
massive and endurable monument

  he returned to his home now that
things were beginning to shape themselves
he would have little trouble in living there
until the winter set in then as he had
planned he would emerge from his hiding-
place drift slowly and cautiously back to
civilization and in some great city enjoy
the money he had stolen

  when that was gone the villain mused
he would start forth again there were
other trains that he could hold up and it
would not be unpleasant to again think of
the world being startled by the daring esca-
pades of baker of the bad lands and
having held up another train he would re-
turn to this spot-which he quaintly chris-
tened bakerville

  that night he slept more peacefully than
he had slept for many moons

  when he retired he felt secure in his
hiding-place he had started a comfortable
home which he would improve from day to
day-yes he would even have plant-vines
and train them over his porch and windows
he would set stones in front to form a yard
he would gather a sufficient number of old

to be co

 stove-lengths to pipe the water to his back
 door he would contrive to make a quilt to
 cover him at night he would try a roast
 lizard some day and he would wander into
 the wilderness in search of a bird

   oh he would be a king a lord of the
manor a prince who was the master of
possessions that were fertile and flowery
and he would plant trees anj flowers in his
front yard and he wouldmake himself a
comfortable chair and sit there and watch
the sun turn the sky to crimson and hear
the night birds pour forth their melody to
the moon-

   baker had fallen into a deep sleep and
was dreaming

   the next morning he peeled a few pota-
 toes and went to the spring to get the water
 in which to boil them when -he had filled
 the pot he arose and turned completely
 around-his old habit

   the pan dropped from his hand with a
crash his heart which had become at-
tuned to the silence of the wilderness seemed
to pound his ribs and his breath came in
short gasps

   over the trail by which he had found
his way to die deserted camp a man was
tramping

   this man saw baker and he quickened
his steps he was a big grizzled man of
middle age and he walked with a gingery
alertness that baker did not like

   as he came closer it was evident that he
 was armed-two hefty six-guns hung from
 either hip

   baker felt for his weapon in his sense
 of security he had left it in his cabin

on his way home from new york he left his

in which he made the rest of the journey being

he discovered that the locomotive was not doing
its best work this was no fault of the man in
charge on reaching baltimore he had the engine
turned over to test experts the fault in the
locomotive was soon discovered and rectified but
this did not suit the chief and he gave orders-for

-musings of the master mechanic
on the immigrant special

by george e mayo

what becomes of the army of immigrants which this country receives
from year to year after they have been passed by the government and
ticketed to their destinations by the trunk lines associations clear-
ing-house at ellis island

    here is the answer to this momentous question which many of our readers
probably have asked since reading mr mulligans article in last months issue
of the railroad mans magazine about the wonderful organization that
segregates the bewildered newcomers places them aboard train and starts them
on their journey into the new world

    the immigrant service is a branch of railroad work peculiar to itself it
is recognized in the organization of every big railroad in the country having-
eastern seaboard connections it is replete with incidents that amuse as well
as touch the heart	

travel in the immigrant coaches often furnishes some odd bits of comedy
and tragedy that rarely reach the notice of those who
ride in the pullmans up ahead

broadly speaking the traffic of
railroads is of two kinds
w freight and passenger it is
 the unofficial opinion of a good
many railroad men however
that there should be a third
class namely immigrant traffic certainly
the handling of this business on the roads
which carry the bulk of it is an undertaking
entirely separate and distinct from that of
handling the regular passenger business

  it is a service that has its own coaches
in which the ordinary traveler never rides
-never at least after they have been used
once or twice by the immigrants it is
handled through its own stations which
the ordinary traveler over the road never
enters

  its conditions are unlike the conditions
under which any other kind of passenger
traffic is carried on in comparison with
the task of chaperoning a dozen or so coach-
es filled with the raw material of ameri-
can citizenship taking a sunday excur-

sion crowd out of south chicago or west
hoboken is an easy matter

  the obliging official of fiction who fixes
up a special at  am for the hero or
heroine to catch the crack  through thun-
derbolt that left thirty-seven minutes be-
fore on a schedule with no stops can take
no medals for celerity from the men who
have to shove along the immigrant trains
when half a dozen big liners come into
port and ellis island begins to pass them
along to the operating department

ellis island the nucleus

  as ellis island is where about eighty per
cent of the incomers first set foot on ameri-
can soil-said soil being in this case a
wooden gangway-it is the trunk lines
running out of new york that get most
of the immigrant business sixty per cent
of all those who land at that port are tick-
eted out without stop-over by one or an-
other of these roads


the railroad mans magazine

  ports other than new york get only an
occasional slice of this business boston
received about  immigrants last year
baltimore  philadelphia 
while over  came in at various
other points most of these newcomers are
bound either for the cities where they land
or points not far away and cut practi-
cally no figure in railroad traffic

  it is only at the big terminals over on
the jersey shore of the hudson and in
the traffic offices on the manhattan side
that they roll up their sleeves and get
ready for quick action when the liners
come in it wont do to keep the american
citizen-in-the-raw waiting all night in a
jersey railroad station unless the road is
ready to foot the lodging bill and when
there are two or three thousand of him to
lie taken care of in the course of an after-
noon action has to be prompt

   it is one of the peculiarities of the immi-
grant business that it comes spasmodically
depending as it does upon the schedules of
the transatlantic steamship lines one
day not a ticket may be given out by the
immigrant clearing-house of the trunk
lines association at ellis island the
next may see the arrival in port of half a
dozen boats from as many european ports
and the clearing-house may be filled and
emptied many times in the course of the
days work

easy prey for swindlers

   nor is it only celerity that is required
these throngs of bewildered strangers
helpless as so many children under the un-
accustomed conditions which surround them
must not only be set down at their destina-
tions as expeditiously as possible but care
must also be taken to see that they are set
down at the right destinations

  they must also be protected en route
from the extortions and wiles of tricksters
who consider the ignorant and credulous
stranger but fair game it may seem that
there can be little opportunity for the faker
to swindle the occupants of the immigrant
coaches since ordinary passengers are not
admitted to these and the presence of in-
truders is certain to be discovered by the
trainmen	

   in spite of all precautions the resource-
fulness of the modern crook often finds a
way if of foreign origin he can pass him-
self off as a worldly-wise countryman of the

newcomer and in this role he has the choice
of an unlimited variety of schemes for
separating the victim from his savings
the commonest trick is to represent himself
as being able to procure the immigrant a
job the preliminary thereto being of course
the payment of a fee ranging from  to
 according to the immigrants means
and the operators nerve

variety of bunco games

  there are plenty of other games how-
ever ranging in originality and daring from
selling to the bedazed wanderer the very
coach in which he is riding to plain bare-
faced robbery

  it is true that opportunities for perpe-
trating frauds of this kind are pretty strict-
ly limited while the immigrant is actually
under the wing of the road for among
their duties the officials and employees
charged with his safe transportation num-
ber that of discouraging such ingenious
games

  that they are successfully carried out
from time to time is due as much to the
victims inability to tell when he is being
fleeced and his fear of complaining of the
acts of persons having in his eyes an ap-
pearance of authority as to the superior
skill of the crooks

  it is not often however that one hears
of such a daring piece of work as that
which two men pulled off one night in
july last year on a train between jersey
city and paterson this was a case of
plain robbery the startling feature of
it was the nerve of the robbers in attempt-
ing to do what they did and the fact that
they succeeded

  the train was a limited and on the
night in question a couple of immigrant
coaches carrying some sixty or more re-
cently landed passengers bound for western
points had been hitched on the rear

bedlam on wheels

  immigrant cars are likely to be put on
any of the trains that run out of jersey city
at any time and while they are not ex-
actly popular with the crews it is all a
part of the days work the trainmen on
the limited werent worrying about their
two loads of  greenies  trailing along be-
hind and it was not until the train slowed
down at paterson that the veils and screams
ox the immigrant special



from the rear coaches attracted any notice
then the conductor went back with a
couple of husky trainmen to suppress what
he supposed was an incipient race riot

  he opened the door upon a scene a great
deal more startling than a riot the aisle
was strewn with bundles empty valises
and their contents over these scattered
belongings frightened frantic men and
women were shrieking and running about
in confusion while others equally excited
were holding up empty  pocketbooks and
shaking fingers stripped of rings before
the faces of the astonished trainmen

  after a lot of time and a good deal of
questioning the cause of the disturbance
was discovered it appeared that immedi-
ately after the train pulled out of the sta-
tion at jersey city two masked men en-
tered the first of the immigrant cars one
stopped at the front door of the first car
and displayed a revolver ready for business
while the other went through the passengers
in a deft and nimble manner not only re-
quiring each to turn his pockets inside out
but also making them open their valises
and bundles the contents of which he
searched

held up in cars

  in the next car the highwaymen repeat-
ed their work with equal thoroughness
threatening to shoot any of their victims
who made a noise the threat and the
sight of the pistol was enough

  not a man iruthe coaches showed fight
and the silence which prevailed until the
robbers jumped as the train began to slow
down was perfect the vocal efforts which
followed their departure and which alarmed
the train crew however more than made
up for the previous stillness

  as none of the immigrants could speak
more than a few words of english the
officials of the road to whom the case was
promptly reported had a hard time getting
anything like an adequate description of
the robbers consequently they have not
up to date been disturbed in the enjoy-
ment of their boot which amounted to
about  in money besides a quart or so
of rings and other cheap jewelry

  as an illuminating comment on the aver-
age immigrants understanding of the new
conditions by which lie finds himself sur-
rounded the fact may be mentioned that
some of the victims did not know that they

had been robbed until they were told by the
trainmen they had thought they ex-
plained that it was a new kind of tax
they were being made to pay and they re-
garded the somewhat abrupt methods used
as the ordinary manner of the tax-collector

just does as he is told

  this however is an unusual incident in
immigrant traffic ordinarily the worst
extortion encountered is at the hands of
some vender of refreshments-dining-cars
are not run on immigrant trains nor is the
immigrant admitted to the station restau-
rant under ordinary conditions-while the
immigrants chief discomforts are those he
brings on himself or suffers through his
ignorance of common hygienic and sani-
tary principles

  he has not even to worry about his safe
arrival at his destination-a question which
harasses the nerves of a good many trav-
eling americans especially women who
ought to know better his responsibility in
that connection was settled when he ar-
ranged his passage probably before ever
departing from the fatherland

  he has only to do as lie is told the road
does the rest and sees that he is not lost
mislaid or stolen until the time when he
is gently shoved out of the car upon the
platform of the station designated on his
ticket and into the arms of his waiting
friends and relatives

  a better understanding of what this
means in the way of organized effort may-
be arrived at by following the course of
one individual of the hundreds of thou
sands who are annually transported over
thousands of miles and set down safely at
the end of their journey at a destination
the name of which they may not be even
able to pronounce

how casimir came

  there is for instance the case of casimir
podolsky casimir hails from a little
village somewhere in the polish prussian
provinces where the government has been
attempting to germanize the native polish
population with a resulting encouragement
to emigration

  casimir dislikes the idea of serving in
the kaisers army or perhaps it is his ex-
periences in that service that instil in him
the feeling of unrest anyhow he decides


the railroad mans magazine

that tlie time is ripe to transfer his allegi-
ance and his husky muscular equipment
to the land of the free and the home of the
dollar

  there is a brother henryk who has al-
ready been in america two years and who
writes to casimir that he can get him a
job in a place called cleveland if lie will
come at once casimir goes to the nearest
agent of one of the transatlantic lines if
henryk has not already made arrangements
for his passage in cleveland and pays
down his money for the through trip so
many marks for the steerage to new york
and so many more for a railroad ticket at
immigrant rates from new york to cleve-
land the agent gives him a mysterious
looking pale green document stamped and
inscribed with german writing which casi-
mir cannot read

through the clearing-house

   nevertheless his faith in it is great and
rightly placed for the document is an or-
der uion the immigrant clearing-house of
the trunk lines association at ellis is-
land for rail passage thence to cleveland
already casimir becomes an object of in-
terest to the traffic branch he is now
immigrant business in its first stage

  the second stage is ellis island when
the immigration bureau has taken casi-
mirs declaration and pedigree has duly
thumped him on the chest looked at his
eyes for trachoma and at his scalp for skin
diseases made him turn his pockets out and
show his money and decided that he is
qualified for admission it ties a large
numbered label in his buttonhole and pass-
es him along to the end of the long low
red-brick wing where the immigrant clear-
ing-house has its offices

  here uncle sams concern with him ends
and that of the railroad begins for the
immigrant clearing-house is the institution
jointly maintained by the trunk lines run-
ning out of new york to the west through
which all their immigrant business is
handled

  if you have ever bought a ticket to the
annual outing of the united lime-pickers
association at paradise park and then tried
to get on the train of three coaches and a
baggage-car filled principally with re-
freshments simultaneously with your
 fellow-excursionists if you have ever
attemnted to storm vour way to a satur-

day double-header at the west side grounds
ten minutes before playing time when the
cubs were lighting the giants if you
have ever been a brooklyn commuter you
may be able to form some faint idea of
what the immigrant clearing-house is like
on a busy afternoon

   lo fully realize however you must see
and hear it on such an occasion the
packed mass of alien humanity which
had just passed the bewildering process of
inspection by the immigration officers flows
along babbling all the tongues and dia-
lects of europe submitting sheep-like to
an authority which it does not understand
and creating apparently hopeless confusion
as it packs into the big main receiving-
room where the various bureaus of the
clearing-house are

  the confusion is only apparent how-
ever as a matter of fact there is a ready
hand and a voice speaking his own lan-
guage to guide the immigrant at every turn
until he finally lands in the proper compart-
ment ticketed relabeled and ready for the
next stage

no chance to go wrong

  there is never a chance for casimir to
lose his way or make a mistake authority
in a uniform meets him at the entrance
and steers him straight every time-first
to the ticket-window where he surren-
ders his pea-green document and gets in
return a much less imposing looking slip of
pasteboard which reads jersey city to
cleveland

   thence he goes to the money desk where
lie turns his marks into good american coin
at the prevailing rate of exchange may-
be he goes to the telegraph office where he
sends word to cleveland when and by what
train he may be expected

  if instead of having his passage pre-
paid casimir is one of the twenty-five per
cent who wait until arriving at ellis is-
land before buying their railroad tickets
the process is the same except that he gets
his money changed before going to the
ticket window

   after all this is over he is shunted off
into another room divided by wire par-
titions into several compartments each one
of which is plainly marked  erie  d
l  w b   west shore and
so on through the list of roads belonging
to the trunk lines association
on the immigrant special



  into the right compartment they steer
casimir where he stays until it is time to
go on board the boat it isnt always the
same road to the same destination for the
attempt is made to concentrate each days
business as much as possible upon one or
two lines

making up the trains-

  thus one day it will be the lackawanna
the next the west shore the next the erie
the baggage is similarly sorted out in an-
other series of compartments

  meanwhile the various railroad operating
departments are getting ready as the clear-
ing-house sends word  six hundred com-
ing up at  to one four hundred
at  oclock to another and so on through
the list

  sometimes the days grist can be handled
in one instalment sometimes the clearing-
house is emptied and filled again several
times in an afternoon however fast they
come and however short the notice it is the
operating departments business to be ready

  once uncle sam has passed them the im-
migrants cannot leave ellis island too
promptly to suit him as all his spare space
is needed for the next arriving batch the
clearing-house has even scantier accom-
modations than the government its re-
sponsibility is ended when it has delivered
casimir and his companions at hoboken
weehawken or jersey city as the case
may be it is then up to the various rail-
road operating departments to make the
next move or provide lodging for the crowd

  consequently these move in double-quick
time from the moment that word is re-
ceived from the island the special sta-
tions maintained by the principal lines at
their jersey terminals for the exclusive ac-
commodation of immigrant traffic are quite
able to hold five or six hundred persons
at once

ready to start

  their appointments if not so elaborate
as those of the regular passenger stations
are adequate and are superior to anything
those who use them have been accus-
tomed to heretofore the resources of a
separate immigrant lunch-counter are avail-
able to those who have not bought one of
the regulation box lunches sold at ellis is-
land it isnt such a tedious wait there-
fore until a string of immigrant coaches
 r r	

which are simply standard passenger coach-
es assigned to immigrant service can be
coupled up and backed into die station

  if coaches enough are filled they will be
made up into a special train if not they
are attached to the rear of one of the regu-
lar trains forty to a coach is the stand-
ard allotment of immigrant passengers al-
though the ordinary coach has seating-
room for sixty

  packing them to capacity however is
not regarded as good policy on the tedious
day-and-night runs with frequent lay-overs
which the immigrant train has to make to
avoid interfering with the regular schedules

  even with the coaches filled to only two-
thirds of their normal capacity the at-
mosphere is apt to be rather stuffy but
casimir and his traveling companions dont
mind that ventilation is an art with which
they have never concerned themselves

  nor do they miss the absent sleeper
but indulge in refreshing slumber sitting
bold upright or curled up on the seats
food and drink they can buy plentifully
at the stations along the road

  altogether it is far from an unpleasant
experience to casimirs mind it is bet-
ter than the steerage for even if the space
for movement is a trifle more cramped
there is at least always something new to
see from the windows of the train and
there is no strict discipline of the ship to
be submitted to

in the immigrant coaches

  here is something of the atmosphere of
the land of freedom one can talk and
smoke and sing and generally do as one
pleases even to the extent of taking part
in a friendly row when the bottle which
some one is pretty sure to produce has cir-
culated a sufficient number of times to
stimulate the spirit of argument

  said indulgence however is found speed-
ily to result in the appearance of members
of the train crew with a display of hard
fists and brief courtesy which often ends
in knocking the participants into opposite
corners and compelling them to stay there

  milder social amenities proceed un-
checked however acquaintances of the
steerage are sure to be numbered among
the party and new friendships are soon
made in the enforced companionship of
the journey the first few hours sees the
formation of many congenial little groups


the railroad mans magazine

  those of the same nationality draw
naturally together particularly those who
have known each other in the previous
stages of the passage or who hail from the
same town or district again there is a
mutual bond of interest among those bound
to the same destination new sympathies
are discovered too in the bashful exchange
of glances of admiration and curiosity be-
tween young man and maid who meet thus
strangely so far from their native land

  it would be no unprecedented thing
should casimir introduce to his cleveland
relatives a blushing betrothed whom his
enamored eyes beheld for the first time
across the aisle of the immigrant coach
romance can and does have its beginning
there as well as anywhere else

  speaking of romance here is a story in
point it concerns a railroad man whom
for purposes of identification well call
 bill  atterbury it happened a couple
of years ago before bill was put on the
through run he now has

  on this particular occasion he was run-
ning up to the mines with a rough crowd
of slavs bohemians and italians in
one of the coaches though there was a lit-
tle party of a different sort a welsh family
of father mother and grown-up daughter
going up to scranton

  the girl was quite pretty and not badly
dressed a fact which bill had noticed at
first sight as he was a bachelor then he
managed to keep pretty close to that car
most of the time after that it happened
that there was a particularly ugly bunch
of foreigners in there and bill was in-
clined to fear that there would be trouble

  it came unfortunately when bill was
somewhere else some of the other occu-
pants of the car had noticed the girl also
and although the little party of welsh
folks kept strictly to themselves the men
began staring at her and saying things
among themselves by and by one fel-
low who had had a few drinks too many
stepped over and started to sit down by
the girl

  her father jumped up and struck him
and then three or four more of the gang
piled on top of the old man and tried to

punch holes in him with their boot-heels
while the girl and her mother yelled for
help

  bill heard the yells in the next car in
less than a minute he was in the middle
of the mix-up with both fists flying and
with a -pound pennsylvania dutch
brakeman to help him out

  in less than two minutes bill and the
brakey were in undisputed possession of
the floor except such portions of it as were
occupied by prostrate members of the gang

  naturally the welsh folks made a great
fuss over bill they told him all about
themselves and how they were going to
stay with a son who had succeeded with a
small business in scranton after starting
in the mines bill took another look at
the girl and told them that he often laid
over in scranton that brought an invi-
tation which of course bill accepted

  as previously mentioned- bill was a
bachelor then he isnt now he married
in less than a year afterward and mrs bill
was born in wales

  there is pathos on the immigrant train
as well not more than a year or two ago
there was a russian family on its way to
chicago among the children was a lit-
tle twelve-year-old girl pretty clever and
full of curiosity about everything that was
going on

  it is a longer ride to chicago on an im-
migrant train than on one of the eighteen-
hour fliers and before the trip was over
the child had become a general favorite
in chicago while friends were greeting the
father and mother the little girl was over-
looked for a moment

  when they missed her there was an aw-
ful howl but it was too late she had dis-
appeared in the crowd the station force
and the police did all they could but in
spite of their search she was never found

  the only reasonable explanation of her
disappearance was that she had been kid-
naped not only- the immigrant children
get lost around the stations the grown-
ups often get into trouble when they take
to roaming around by themselves but they
are -usually found and brought back be-
fore twenty-four hours have passed 

we know politeness dont cost nothin but some folks is so proud

how gracie mcphersons blue eyes
saved floyd wilson and his train

racie mcpherson saved
the royal red limited and
no  fast freight and she
wasnt within fifty miles of
either train its not a spook
story you couldnt imagine
anything less like a spook than gracie mc-
pherson she was as plump and as ruddy
as the scotch lassie her father had courted
among the heather thirty years before and
she was as sweet and gentle as the white-
crowned woman who had rested from the
burden of living a year ago the previous
th of august-before father and daughter
came to america

  the date is mentioned because that was
the day that tom mcpherson began to be
 queer and it was die day that lloyd
wilson her fathers fireman had taken
gracies hands in his own and stammered
awkward words of comfort about god and
heaven and the sorrow of her father that
needed her strength

 tom mcpherson had always been a
deliberate man-authoritative but never
tyrannical stern but always just

  that th of august had brought to tom
two things-the inexorable sense of loss and
the equally inexorable knowledge that he
was suffering from an ailment that no en-
gineer has a right to suffer from and work
it was on the very evening of that day that
he had fallen ghastly pale and sucking in
great gasps of breath into his big arm-
chair in a moment gracie was at his side

  reviving just in time to prevent his

daughter from giving an alarm he had cau-
tioned her harshly against ever breadiing a
word about the incident for he saw in the
long idle days of retirement a terror that
his lonely soul could not face

  gracie looking into his eyes saw the
change and the terror without knowing
what either meant and her heart sought
comfort in the memory of two strong hands
that had enfolded hers and two serious
gray eyes that had spoken of tenderer things
than the lips had dared to frame

  next day on the run the old man was
morose and irritable the following day
he was the same and each succeeding day
seemed to add sourness to his disposition
lloyd met his changed mood with a patience
built upon years of loyal friendship and
a pity that never forgot the old mans loss

  no friendship nor pity could withstand
the gradual undermining of confidence that
was bound to result from diese strained re-
lations the reason for which lloyd could
not always fathom

  for years they had worked togedier with
the efficiency of mutual confidence-the
splendid cooperation that builds friendship
now a mutual distrust crept stealthily into
the spirit of the days work-a distrust laden
with possibilities of wreck and death and
lifelong tragedy

  if lloyd was at first in doubt about the
underlying cause of his engineers new-
born dislike he was soon to have it hurled
upon him with die staggering pain of an un-
expected blow




the railroad mans magazine

  on the second sunday gracie for the
sake of her father bore her blushes and sent
a little note to him appealing to him to come
and try to cheer her father out of his gloom
and because there was creeping into his own
life something new and alluring and win-
some he went

  gracie busied herself preparing dinner
while the two men made shift to be as un-
comfortable as possible lloyd made one
or two awkward attempts at conversation
drawing from the old man a surly mono-
syllable or two and then mcpherson got up
and went into the garden carefully closing
the door after him as a hint that the garden
would hold only one man at a time

    is anything the matter between father
and you asked gracie coming in a min-
ute later and finding lloyd alone

  not that i know of answered lloyd
 i think hes just brooding over his trouble
hell be all right in a week or two

  she began to set the table just as her
father came in he stood for a moment and
watched her and as she placed a knife and
fork in the place always occupied by the
fireman a dull flush crept over his neck and
ears and face he turned slowly on his
visitor

  lloyd wilson he said dont you
know when youre not welcome 

   gracie looked up in wild-eyed astonish-
ment and lloyd flushed scarlet

  why tom he said i didnt think
i was unwelcome

  no well let me tell you you are
ive been watching you for a long time ive
seen the way you look at my girl and the
soapy manner you talk and act to her and
let me tell you there isnt any mooning lout
of a tallow-pot going to take my lassie away
from me while ive strength to order him out
of the house you can go and he added
with sour sarcasm dont you come again
until you get a written invitation from me
shamed and humiliated the girl fled be-
fore the tirade was finished and lloyd not
daring to trust the anger that flared up with-
in him and consumed the affection of years
picked up his hat and went

   then the old man bitter without cause
began a systematic persecution of his fireman
that was as senseless as it was cruel only a
fireman can understand the thousand ways
in which an engineer can make life unbear-
able for the second man in the cab

   the running position of the reverse-lever
was changed and the engine used ten or fif-

teen per cent more steam than she had ever
done and did her work less easily the skil-
fully built fire would be whirled into bare
spots and deadening heaps and coughed
through the exhaust with disheartening per-
sistence when it was most needed

  the result was that the engine with its
forty loads went dead twice within a month
at the barden grade laying out the limited
once for ten minutes while the teutonic
patience that lloyd wilson inherited from
his mother began giving way before the hot
passion of his fathers celtic blood

  he had been humiliated in the eyes of
his workmates and superiors and belittled
in his own esteem but he had kept his
tongue under guard through the memory of
an appealing troubled face that had been
turned to him for a second in its grief

  he had seen her once or twice but there
had been no opportunity for more than a
few words since that memorable sunday at
length they met in the post-office nearly a
mile from mcphersons house as they went
out lloyd walked up the road with her

   gracie he said  i cant stand this any
longer

  what she asked faintly

   the way your father treats me hes
making life a misery to me hes disgracing
me as a fireman and hes keeping me from
you though he knows i love you with all the
strength of my life

   you ought not to talk like that to me
lloyd when you know how my father feels
about it murmured gracie the pink of her
cheeks hiding itself in her throbbing heart

   im not going to discuss the rights and
wrongs of it he blurted roughly  ive
suffered wrongs enough to balance his
rights and a man has no rights that injure
other peoples lives anyhow

   ive treated him like a son and ive
earned his respect but what has he given
me insult and shame i love you dear
he went on softening  but i wouldnt
stand in the way of anybodys duty to-
day i shall apply to be transferred and if
im refused ill quit but im going to
work and wait and im going to make a
home for you if youll come to it when-
when you can

   i cant talk about that now lloyd im
too upset and miserable youll have to
speak to my father

   your father- he began hotly then
stopped  ive made my last run with
your father hefinished doggedly
two men

in a cab



  the memory of the three mysterious
courage-shattering attacks stabbed the girls
heart with anxiety for her father

   oh lloyd she pleaded dont leave
him im so worried and frightened hes
an old man and nearly crazy with grief
and-and- her courage failed and she
dared not tell  dont leave him go to-
night anyhow lloyd promise me youll

exhaust told of the mighty power that wa
moving a mighty weight

  as the train gained momentum she
picked up speed and soon was making
thirty miles on a gentle down grade then
came a slight up grade from the usual
running position mcpherson pulled the
reverse down three notches and the ex-
haust sighed great wet sobs into the night

in a moment gracie was at his side

go and look out for him im so miser-
able she finished moaningly

  lloyd caught her hand in an impulsive
tenderness poor little girl he soothed
 its been with the memory of you that
ive borne all his insults and abuse without
a word and for your sake ill go to-night
but i cannot promise more for theres an
awful temper pulling at myiwill and im
at the far end

  he pressed her hand a moment then
dropped it and was gone

  the run began eventfully in the gather-
ing dusk that evening the fire-box send-
ing out a soft gentle glow that grew bright-
er as the black background of night crept
on the men read the orders and the en-
gineer signed them and then after a slip
or two of the drivers the slow rhythmic

   lloyd swung his arms with increased
 energy to carry her up the grade without
 losing pressure but with the persistence of
 fate the gage fell back two hundred and
 ten two hundred and five two hundred
 one hundred and ninety-five one hundred
 and ninety and then the grade was topped
 and the heart-breaking pull on the gage
 ceased though the exhaust waste w-ent on
  with painful slowness the needle climbed
  back

   whats the matter growled mcpher-
 son hoarsely  i havent heard that pop-
 valve for the age of a duck

   lloyd did not reply though his nerves
 tingled and his brain was hotter than the
 fire-box

    i reckon the pop-valve must be bro-
 ken shouted the old man tauntingly


the railroad mans magazine

 dont you know when youre not welcome  

 ill put a requisition in if you say so
well be blowing the gage to pieces first
thing you know

  well never blow any gage to pieces
while you keep a cut-off that carries ten
pounds of pressure up the stack every time
she exhausts what did you want to drop
the reverse for shouted the fireman and
then he choked off before his anger could
overpower him

   bah  you ought to fire a donkey-en-
gine retorted the engineer disgustedly

  they were on the single track section
between cedarville and barden brixton
lies between the two with the cedarville
grade dipping through it and the barden
up grade beginning about a mile beyond

  previously the  was scheduled to get
onto the double track at barden before
meeting the flier but that day had seen
the making of a new schedule for the flier
and the fast freight was ordered  get into
clear at brixton and wait for the flier to
pass the new orders had nettled the
engineer and as it proved it was this that
brought tragedy into the nights run

   i suppose you noticed we have to take
the siding at brixton for the flier he
yelled above the crash of the exhaust
reckon they got tired of us dying half
way up the barden grade and laying the
limited out

   i reckon so said lloyd mopping his
forehead and refusing the bait they were
topping the summit for the cedarville dip
and she had a full head and little work for
the next five miles

   i understand you were going to quit
me to-day if it hadnt been for gracie
lloyd nodded surlily

   well i dont care a darn and gracie
only wants to save me breaking in a new
man i told her that wouldnt hurt me
and she dont care now whether you go or
stay she says youre a quitter and a cow-
ard anyhow

  then the iron restraint of over a year
broke down lloyd leaped across the cab
and grasped the old man roughly by the
arm as his hand was about to close the
throttle he swung him half around and
glared up demoniacally into his face

   youre a liar he screamed

  half surprised and half frightened mc-
pherson grasped a heavy wrench and
swung it downward the blow was partly-
blocked by the others arm but it dazed
the fireman and forced him reeling back-
ward mad with rage the old man sprang
down from his seat

  a second blow struck wilson on the
shoulder but before mcpherson could strike
again an agony of pain and terror flashed
into his eyes and overspread his face and
       - m w- s -

two men

with heart-piercing yell he crumpled to the
iron floor his limbs working and his lungs
sucking in great sobs of breath

   my pocket lloyd  look in my pock-
et   he gasped with a mighty effort point-
ing to where his coat hung above the re-
verse lever then he straightened out con-
vulsively dead

  the light of madness was still in wil-
sons eyes the revulsion the breaking
down of the iron will that had dammed
his rage for so long and the message from
the girl combined to produce an obsession
of rage that the death of his enemy would
be the last thing that could stem

  for a second his dazed eyes took in
the scene then comprehending with a weird
laugh of triumph he sprang to the engi-
neers seat he would be engineer now
through five miles of a ripping ride to
death he was boss in the cab at last

  he looked back the last load had
topped the summit and they were gather-
ing headway for the wild plunge down the
mountain with the limited in their path

in a cab	

near the end if they kept the rails he
would keep them on the rails

  he twitched the handle of the westing-
house a little to steady them so as not
to end the ride too soon the steam still
hissed through a wide open throttle it
should be a glorious ride

  he looked around joyfully and touched
the engineers coat as he turned somehow
that coat wove itself into his insane dream
what was there about it the old mans
body caught his eye and he laughed medi-
cine in the pocket probably

  well he was beyond medicine now or
soon would be and lloyd peered grimly
into the flying night a coward and a
quitter eh maybe but here was some-
thing he would see the end of and nobody
could call him a quitter then

  the coat still obtruded itself on his
consciousness its presence seemed to mock
and insult him he was no longer the
boss he had been when he first leaped into
that seat well he would soon make short
work of the intruder


the railroad mans magazine

  he would throw die coat out he turned
and seized it something protruded from
the pocket stiff and large it was a piece
of cardboard on it was some writing in
a hand curiously familiar he read

to my dear old friend lloyd wilson

by courtesy of father

  the date at the corner was that very
day he turned the cardboard over and
into his bright mad eyes looked the half-
wondering wistful eyes of gracie mc-
pherson appealing and innocent they
gazed into his and once more a voice
tinged with the presage of a great trouble
sounded in his ears  promise me 

  like the awakening from stifling ether
his brain slowly cleared and sane he found
himself looking into pictured eyes that mir-
rored life and duty and again the memory
of a voice pleading with the agony of
helplessness came to his unfettered mind
 promise me  

  he glanced around the cab and into the
night and with a cry as pitiful and prayer-
ful as her own he sprang to the engineers
box and snapped the throttle-valve shut
then gently but as quickly as he dared-
for with the long train and the steep in-
cline he dared not risk a derail-he pulled
the air lever around to the emergency notch
and there was a shrill screeching of shoes
on wheels

  the check was hardly perceptible but she
ceased to gain he would have to plug
her and for one man at such a speed
there is danger as well as hard work in the
feat

  he straddled the quadrant released the
catch and put his whole soul into a mighty
pull she came until she was almost up-
right and then began the struggle

  with sickening jerks she bucked against
him but still he strained and then with
a snap the lever went over and he locked
her two notches to the good in the reverse
position the horror of the approaching
limited began to obsess him but he put it
from him and held his nerves with a will
of steel

gently slowly he leaked steam into the

cylinders and then he felt the shove of
the steam on the pistons gently he opened
her farther the momentum was being
checked and everything was holding so far
but they were nearing brixton and he must
have her under control for the siding

  the dread that he might fail gripped
him for a second but he shook it off he
gave her more steam and the speed slack-
ened perceptibly still he kept up the back-
ward drive until he felt her answering to
his touch then he released the brakes a
little and when he tightened them again
he knew he had her under control

  he pulled down the cord and whistled tri-
umphantly for the siding then he closed
the throttle and eased the reverse-lever in-
to running position with the air at the serv-
ice hole and the train making a normal
gait for the switch

  when they found him he -was leaning
over the body of the man he had loved and
in his hand was the letter-found in the
same pocket as the photograph that had
restored his reason it was in the old mans
writing

  my dear lloyd 

    this is the written invitation from me
  though t have a feeling i shall not be there
  to meet you when you accept it ever since
  the wife went i have known my doom was
  sealed and it has made a coward and a tyrant
  of me every time i step into the cab i am
  crazy with fear and when i saw you at the
  house i was crazy with fear and jealousy
  for i knew i had not long to be with my little
  girl so the result for you has been such as
  only the bravest and truest man in the world
  could have stood in a way i am glad you
  have gone through it though god knows i
  have not put you through it purposely but
  it lets me know before i go that my little
  gracie will have a man for a husband i
  feel as if this will be my last run though i
  hope i am wrong and i have left a note for
  gracie telling her what a true man and a
  true friend you are though i know the girl
  knows it better than i do take care of her
  lloyd if it should take me on this run for-
  give me for everything boy and god bless
  you

             your old friend

first fight for a railway

by felix g prentice

history proves that every great invention or discovery no matter how-
many blessings it promised to mankind at some stage of its develop-
ment has been met by a wave of popular opposition often emanating
from the very persons it was designed to benefit

    the railroad has been no exception to this rule in great britain and
america the first proposals to build road-beds and lay rails were blocked and
hindered through ignorance prejudice and fear ignorance on the part of those
who would not believe what their own eyes told them was true prejudice among
the narrow - minded who on general principles opposed everything that was
new and unknown fear among those who believed that their means of liveli-
hood would be threatened by the new method of transportation

    these were the popular impressions which the builders of englands pio-
neer line from liverpool to manchester had to contend with in their legal
fight to gain the governments consent to their plan many of the questions
asked and the answers given during the famous proceedings before the com-
mittee of the house of commons in this day of progress are as funny as honk
and horace trying to break into society

     this article and the concluding one next month will present the ridiculous
ideas the people of eighty odd years ago had in regard to railroads and they
throw a great light on the almost hopeless array of fallacies and misconcep-
tions which george stephenson and his associates had to overcome before they
were permitted to turn a wheel

determined effort of british lawyers to prove that stephensons locomo-
tive would either blow up stand still or
slide down hill

iie first legal battle for the
construction of a railroad was
fought in  in england
when the proposal to construct
a line between liverpool and
manchester was considered by
a committee of the house of commons
the sanction of parliament had been pre-
viously given to other lines but they were
chiefly unimportant in extent and did not
encounter much opposition but in 
the great struggle was between the railroad
and the canal as modes of transit and

the interest at stake was the continued
progress of the great towns of liverpool
and manchester

  the anticipation of the men and the
actual results will show the ignorance of
mankind-eighty-six years ago-regarding
the powers of natural forces

  the committee of the house of commons
to whom the bill was referred met for the
first time on monday march  
the chair was occupied by general gas-
coigne who was then member for liver-
pool the other extremity of the line the




the railroad mans magazine

city of manchester was neither represented
on the committee nor in parliament for
manchester was then neither a borough nor
a city

  the railroad company appeared by coun-
sel the chief of which was sergeant span-
kie and mr adam arrayed against the
bill was a formidable phalanx of canal-
owners road trustees and landed proprie-
tors among whom were the trustees of the
duke of bridgewater the proprietors of the
mersey and irwell navigation company
the proprietors of the leeds and liverpool
canal the trustees of barton road near
manchester sir william gerrard charles
orrell and other landed proprietors
through whose property the line was in-
tended to pass the legal talent engaged
on their side appeared overwhelming mr
alderson mr harrison mr rose mr
earle and mr cullen being eminent law-
yers of their day

pleas of the promoters

  the first day was entirely occupied by
the opening statement of mr adam on
behalf of the promoters of the line

  he began by saying that he proposed to
discuss the subject from two points of view
-first-with reference to the state of com-
mercial interests and secondly as con-
nected with a more expeditious mode of
conveyance

  railroads are a more convenient safer
more economical and a more certain mode
of conveyance than any others which now
exist said mr adam  unless something
isydone to increase the facility of communi-
cation between liverpool and manchester
the advances now being made in commercial
prosperity must cease economy is one of
the principal things on which to found the
success of our commercial interests if the
committee find that by the mode suggested
parties will be able to convey goods from
the place of manufacture to the place of
exportation at a very reduced rate and in
much less time than at present the present
measure ought to receive the sanction of
the legislature

  the promoters of the bill ask permis-
sion to make a railroad for the purpose of
procuring a more expeditious mode of con-
veyance between the towns of liverpool and
manchester they allege that  the ma-
king and maintaining of a railway or tram-
road with proper works and conveniences

  adjoining thereto or connected therewith
for the passage of wagons and other car-
riages from or near the town of liverpool
in the county of lancaster in and through
the several parishes or places hereinafter
mentioned to the town of manchester in
the same county will be of great advantage
to the inhabitants of the said county towns
and places by opening an easy and expe-
ditious communication between the two
large trading towns of liverpool and man-
chester and by affording an additional
mode of transit for merchandise between
those places and also to and from the
neighboring county and will in various
other respects be of public utility

   need of greater transit facilities

   the present means of transit are not
sufficient in themselves they are uncer-
tain attended with great risk and with
great expense the promoters of the bill
do not desire to supersede any of the ex-
isting establishments on the contrary they
are desirous to go hand-in-hand with them
the new railroad shall be as speedy as
cheap and as certain as the canal in all
respects

   manchester and the country of which
it is the center includes a manufacturing
population of over half a million the
population of manchester alone amounts
to one hundred and sixty-five thousand
within the last three years it has increased
thirty thousand and that perhaps is carry-
ing it further back than the great commer-
cial increase of the country requires man-
chester is the channel of communication
through which the clothiers of yorkshire
export tiieir commodities and the manu-
facturers of sheffield send much of their
hardwares as well as a variety of other
commodities they all make use of man-
chester as the center and require the same
means of transit as the goods manufac-
tured in the immediate vicinity of that large
and populous town

   there are a great quantity of manu-
factured articles the transit of which is
to be provided for at manchester to liver-
pool they require extensive mean of
transit and- if diat be so with the articles
exported it must be exceeded by the im-
ported articles for the greater part of the
articles manufactured in yorkshire and in
the neighborhood of manchester are far
more bulky and require much more space
first fight for a railway



in their raw state than when manufac-
tured

  mr adam added that the increasing con-
sumption of coal and the output of cotton
added much to the necessity of the road

to help move the cotton

  what is the condition of the cotton
trade from america   he continued  the
whole of the cotton imported into liverpool
with very little exception finds its way to
manchester and at present is imperfectly
supplied by means of the existing canals
the amount of cotton imported in the year
 into liverpool was  bags but
from america alone the quantity exceeded

	bags

   in the year  the canal of the duke
of bridgewater and the mersey and irwell
navigation company were in progress
the population of manchester at that time
did not amount to quite  it is a
most curious fact that in the year 
there did not exist one steam engine in
manchester though in  there were
above two hundred

   so slowly did those advantages find
their way among the manufacturing popu-
lation of manchester that though at pres-
ent there are  looms worked by
steam in  there was not one worked
in that way this circumstance is men-
tioned for the purpose of contending that
if it is found that the articles sent from
manchester to liverpool and the raw ar-
ticles from liverpool to manchester are
so greatly increased and that the facilities
of conveying those articles are not greater
in point of capacity than at that time the
promoters of this bill are entitled to a de-
cision in their favor

   some idea of the demand for the
means of conveyance may be formed when
in addition to these facts attention is called
to the quantity of articles that must be
supplied for the daily consumption of the
inhabitants exclusive of that of the manu-
factories

canal routes unsatisfactory

   the transit between liverpool and
manchester does not fall short of twelve
hundred tons every day and there has
been in the last year an increase of one
thousand tons a week therefore if twelve
hundred tons be the quantity that now

passes every day between those two places
we have reason to believe that an enormous
increase of facility of transit will be re-
quired

   for the passage of bulky articles there
exist three means the mersey and irwell
navigation company the duke of bridge-
waters canal and the leeds and liver-
pool canal the original object of the
last was to communicate between liver-
pool and leeds and it is only a few years
ago that it was made the means of com-
munication between liverpool and man-
chester but the expenses and the circum-
stances under which it is carried on render
it hardly possible that any persons can
avail themselves of that medium of com-
munication those are the only means by
which goods may be sent from liverpool
to manchester

   it will be shown that both the manu-
facturer and the man who sells direct to
the people suffer a great loss and incon-
venience through lack of means to send
their goods to manchester and bring them
back again it will be shown that goods
are materially delayed the carriers say
to the shipper  you had your turn last
week you must wait your time

   if it shall be shown that large manu-
facturers have actually suspended their op-
erations because they have not had the
means of carrying them on if it is shown
that large sums have been lost in conse-
quence of the non-arrival of those goods
will you say for the sake of any person
however meritorious or however respect-
able that you will allow things to remain
in that situation

shipments delayed six weeks

   it will be shown that it has taken
longer time to pass goods from liverpool
to manchester than to bring them over
from america to liverpool it will be
shown that goods have taken twenty-one
days in coming from america to liver-
pool and that they have remained on the
wharves before they could get the means of
conveyance to manchester for more than six
weeks

   persons who have had goods to send
have preferred to send them by common
carts on the turnpike roads rather than
suffer the delay -to which they would be
exposed by the other existing means of
conveyance


the railrqad mans magazine

   during one whole week they passed
but thirty bags for four or five days they
passed none-although the person to whom
it was addressed required one hundred
bags a week to carry on his manufacturing
operations it will be shown that it took
six weeks before this shipment found its
way to manchester to be worked out

   another person you will find was ac-
tually obliged to buy cotton in manchester
in consequence of the delay not intention-
ally but on account of the present inade-
quate means of shipping spinners have
been obliged to stop their employment and
merchants have lost advantageous bargains

   timber has been obliged to be de-
posited on the shores until the ow-ners
have been fined by the corporation of
liverpool for leaving it there beyond the
time which is allowed by act of parlia-
ment because means could not be fur-
nished to carry it into the interior of the
country instances and repeated instances
witl be shown in which corn has been
landed and warehoused because it could
not be sent on

dangers of ocean travel

   liverpool is in an open estuary liable
to the operation of strong tides and most
violent winds in point of fact its navi-
gation is a sea voyage and a sea voyage
under the most serious and inconvenient
circumstances the course of the river
mersey is so shallow and the channel of
the river so narrow that it is navigable only
three hours out of twelve

   you have to thread the mazes of its 
sands and shallows and at all times it
requires great skill to navigate it it will
be proved to you that the vessels must ar-
rive at runcorn where the duke of bridge-
waters canal and the other canal enter
the mersey at high water and that they
must therefore leave liverpool some three
hours before the rise of the tide and on
the other hand in order to get over the
shoals that would obstruct their passage
they must go off at high tide and if they
miss that they lose their voyage

   this navigation is attended with dan-
ger no longer ago than the month of
november last two vessels with all their
crews were lost in their passage from run-
corn to liverpool and three were stranded
that is by no means an infrequent oc-
currence

   with respect to canals sometimes they
have to struggle with frosts so long ago
only as  or  this took place and
twice within a still later period of course
they are liable to drought you cannot
possibly ship goods by those canals where
the boats must pass through a vast number
of locks without a large percentage of
delay or with the same celerity as by the
mode proposed-railroads

  eighteen miles saved by a railroad

  the shortest line by the canals is fifty
miles at least it will be shown that the
average time in performing the voyage
from liverpool to manchester is thirty-one
hours the distance between liverpool
and manchester by the railroad is thirty-
two miles and a half instead of fifty

  since  railroads have been known
to a certain extent but within the last ten
years they have been in use under circum-
stances not to be compared with those un-
der which we stand with great and con-
siderable success

   you will find in the neighborhood of
newcastle an instance of a collier- at het-
ton in which a railroad has been in exist-
ence long enough to show the application
and safety of steam to the conveyance of
heavy articles

   the distance from the colliery of hetton
to the river wear is about seven miles and
the quantity of weight carried is about
sixty tons the route that the railroad is
traveled upon is about four and a half
miles

   it is a railroad under most unfavorable
circumstances in the first place the rail-
road itself is not very perfect but the
machinery of the vehicles in which the
coals are carried is still less perfect than
the road and yet you find that they work
it to the extent of sixty tons

success ot other lines

   it was declared that the steam engine
would be the result of countless disasters
-but nothing has happened the horses
have not started nor the cows ceased to
give their milk at the sight of these things
going forward at the rate of four and a
half miles an hour

   besides the hetton railroad there is
another the killingworth railroad which
has existed for ten or eleven years and
first fight for a railway



which is in the neighborhood of newcastle
this railroad has existed without any doubt
as to its efficacy without any objection and
with the greatest possible advantage

   that railroad runs over an undulating
surface but the proposed liverpool and
manchester railroad will have scarcely any
rise-so little that it is hardly worth no-
ticing it is so far from sudden rises that
it will not be necessary to have one fixed
steam-engine on the whole line

   locomotive engines we shall have and
horses we may employ if we think fit but
we shall not have to employ one single fixed
steam-engine from one end of the line to
the other

   with regard to the liability to accidents
by locomotive steam-engines it is said that
inasmuch as it must be a high - pressure
engine it is not a safe means of employing
the force of steam the answer is that the
assertion is not founded in fact it is true
that we shall be obliged to employ high-
pressure engines-that is engines where the
steam will not be condensed but so far from
their being engines which will increase the
quantity of danger you will find that the
pressure is so very little greater than that of
low-pressure engines that it is scarcely to be
noticed

   you will find that accidents to steam-
engines have arisen from one of two causes
-either from gross negligence which would
have produced the same accident even with
other engines or that the -boilers have been
made of improper materials they have
been made of cast iron if a wrought-iron
boiler bursts the opening is gradual and the
steam gradually escapes and thus it does
away with all danger

six miles an hour hoped for

  parliament has recently passed an act
in which locomotive engines of the kind i
am speaking have been adopted i believe
in the county of durham there is one for
the extent of twenty or twenty-three miles

i	am fully satisfied that locomotive engines
could supply the force to drive a carriage at
the rate of five or six miles an hour i say
that those labored petitions and the oppo-
sition that is to be made plainly show that
those opposed to railroads know that if
steam was applied to the transit of goods
between liverpool and manchester it will
produce the most beneficial results

  referring to opposition mr adam said

    no doubt the complainants on the other
 side are as much entitled to respect as any
 persons in the dominion what is the case
 of lord wilton lord derby and lord
 sefton  they state that they are large pro-
 prietors of lands do they state that
 those smoking engines which are said to
 be nuisances according to law affect their
 dwellings-as if the promoters of the bill
 were going to bring a railroad under their
 parlor windows and deprive them of the
 enjoyment of their own firesides

    this railroad will not pass within two
 miles of lord derbys house nor near the
 residence of lord wilton nor near to lord
 sefton their houses are not within sight
 or within smell or within hearing it must
 be imagination that could induce those noble
 persons to make any opposition so far as
 they are personally concerned

    it may be said in some parts the cut-
 ting culverts or cuts will be deep and will
 impede the passage from one part of those
 noble lords estates to another but you may
 walk across a railroad though you cannot
 walk across the canals

a boon to irish farmers

   america and russia are beginning to
 form railroads and to make use of locomo-
 tive engines in the transit of goods and it
 behooves england to resort to the same
 means of communication think of the ad-
 vantage that would arise from the proposed
 railroad of enabling ireland to bring her
 produce into the british market on as good
 terms as the dutch and some other foreign
 nations

   the whole of the first da- was occupied
 with mr adams speech and during eleven
 days immediately succeeding witnesses were
 examined they were chiefly persons en-
 gaged in trade in liverpool and manchester
 to show that the means of transit by the
 canal were inefficient and slow the state-
 ments made more than bore out all the asser-
 tions on this head in the opening speech of
 the counsel for the railroad proprietors

   sir john gladstone an eminent merchant
 of his day thetather of the late william
 ewart gladstone the greatest british states-
 man of his day was one of the members
 of the committee he was examined as a
 liverpool merchant and gave his evidence
 so decidedly in favor of the scheme that the
 following question and answer passed be-
 tween him and one of the opposing counsel


the railroad mans magazine

  counsel -  you are perfectly satisfied
with the general information you have re-
ceived on the subject you are perfectly
satisfied it will be expeditious and econom-
ical though the question is to be decided by
the committee upon the evidence  

  the witness- i am satisfied but have
changed my opinions before and i may be
induced to change them again

examining witnesses

  the witnesses next examined were the
engineers the first being j u rastrick
he stated that he was a civil engineer at
stourbridge during the eighteen years he
had been so employed he had made a large
number of both condensing and high-pres-
sure steam-engines in his opinion high-
pressure engines were not more liable to
accidents than others and they were pref-
erable because they could be applied in
many situations such as during a scarcity
of water when condensing engines could not
be used he testified that he had made a
locomotive engine ten or twelve years pre-
vious and had made several observations
on the working of locomotives on railroads
in the north of england

  he then gave a description of the parts
and the construction of a locomotive engine
and proceeded to state the results of ex-
periments which in conjunction with mr
george stephenson and others he had made
on locomotives in the north of england

  during january of that year the first
engine they tried was one at killingworth
which they met coming down the line with
a train of wagons it had been at work
since five oclock in the morning and had
not been prepared in any way for experi-
mental purposes

  the length of the road on which the
engine was working was about a mile and a
quarter the ground was undulating the
total rise being from five to six feet the
rails were partly of cast and partly of
wrought iron and in some places had been
laid down for horses

engineer gives his experiences

  the road was in bad order so was the
engine besides there was a very sharp
curve in the road the wheels of the en-
gine were four feet in diameter and the
entire weight of it including tender and
coals was  tons  cwt

  the train consisted of twelve newcastle
caldron-wagons all loaded and weighing
altogether  tons  cwt the eagiiie being
started drew this train along the road a
mile and a quarter in twenty-four minutes
but in returning owing to-the difference in
the gradients it only occupied eighteen min-
utes tiiat is to say the speed going up was
at the rate of  miles per hour and com-
ing down  - the quantity of coal con-
sumed on both journeys was  pounds
other experiments were made showing the
following results	

weight	rate of speed per hour

                                     in miles

   tons  cwtup  down 

         

         

  this third experiment was with another
engine whose wheels were only three feet in
diameter but the four-foot wheels of the
other were put on this and the result was
as follows

  with the engine alone a speed of ten
miles an hour was obtained and with a
load including the engine of about sixty
tons an average speed of  - miles was
gained in these latter experiments it re-
quired a consumption of about  - pounds
of coal and half a gallon of water to take
one ton of goods one mile

  mr rastrick further testified that the
engine might be so improved as to require
only one pound of coal and be able to carry
forty tons at the rate of twelve miles an
hour such engines could be made per-
fectly safe

steam-engine better than horses

                                         i

  mr rastrick then gave the results of
some other experiments made on a line about

	- miles long at hetton colliery near
sunderland on this line there were three
locomotives working the dart tally-
ho and  star these engines had wheels
three feet in diameter

  the first engine taken was the dart
the road on which it ran formed an inclined
plane but the engine pulled up a weight of
about thirty tons at a speed of   miles
an hour in going down die incline steam
was not used at all as the train descended
by its own gravity at the rate of about five
miles an hour

   the steam-engine can be advantageously
applied to the railroad said mr rastrick
first fight for a railway



because in the first place you can obtain
a greater speed than you could conveniently
do by horses your engine is not tired at
the end of the journey it can keep up its
speed during the entire way provided you
supply it with the necessary fuel and water
so that you may go on all day or work a
whole day or a week merely stopping at
such times as is necessary to take in the
coal and water

   it is superior to a water conveyance
because a greater speed is obtained with an
equal power the speed on a canal could
not be increased beyond three or four miles
an hour whether it is produced by horses or
other power the advantages of a railroad
are that there is never any delay upon it
while a canal is closed ten days during the
summer for repairs on a railroad the re-
pairs may be done without any hindrance to
business

  this curious question was then asked
mr rastrick by a lawyer for the opposition

   i have only one question more to ask
you i wish to know if you have made any
observations with respect to the effect of
engines with a train of wagons after it in
motion upon horses  or upon horses in
wagons going along the road  

  mr rastrick replied yes i had a
very good opportunity of making an obser-
vation we were taking the level of the
road at hetton where the railroad crosses the
turnpike-road from sunderland to durham

   made him look a little wildly

  when we had fixed our station-staff
upon the center of the road to take our
levels the wagons came up at that very in-
stant the first wagon was covered and
the driver was inside i called out to him
to stop his horses he did not get out of
the wagon to stop his horses but being a
covered wagon he merely lifted up the
cioth looked out and stopped the horses

    before we had finished our observations
one of the locomotive engines with a train
of wagons behind it came up at the speed
of about five miles an hour the leader-
horse in the wagon was within five or six
yards of the road where the carriages passed

   he was a young horse and did not
seem to be frightened at the train of car-
riages running past him at that velocity
however it made him certainly look a little
wildly

    at the same instant a gentlemanmounted

on a very young horse rode up till his horse
came almost in contact with the train he
checked his horse for about a moment and
let the train pass his horse was no more
frightened than he would have been at the
passing of a stage-coach i called the at-
tention of others to this fact in order that
they might recollect die circumstance

  mr rastrick was subjected to a severe
cross-examination by mr alderson in
which however his evidence was not shaken
what the lawyer made of it may be gathered
from the following extract from his own
speech in summing up

why the engine couldnt move

    i think he said  they have given us
a theory against the practise a contro-
versy arose between mr rastrick and me
affecting the rate of traveling with those
machines he admitted that in the case of
an engine standing still and kept from mov-
ing by the weight sufficient to prevent it
from moving forward and operating over
a single fixed pulley though the wheels of
the engine should by an increase of the
power of the steam turn round more rap-
idly it would produce no increase of moving
force and the engine would continue to
stand still

   but he says and says truly that when
the engine is in motion if there be a moving
force sufficient to overcome the resistance
behind it if there be no slipping of the
wheels the engine will then move forward
more rapidly in direct proportion to the
rapidity with which the wheels turn round

   i agree to that if the fact be so but
it may happen that the machine is not per-
fectly steady upon its wheels these may
slip back the weight may perhaps overcome
the moving force in question produced by
the friction thtf slipping back may increase
as the weight to be drawn increases and
die question is will there not be slipping
which has a tendency to counteract the
power of the machine to go forward

how to prove that she slips

  mr rastrick admits to me that if on
an inclined plane you get to a certain ele-
vation the machine may turn its wheels
round but will not go forward or back-
ward  because in that instance the resolved
part of the force of gravity on that plane is
exactly sufficient to counterbalance the fric-


the railroad mans magazine

tion by which the machine is intended to
be propelled and the one counterbalancing
the other the whole will remain stationary

  now if we have an engine moving at
a certain rate not indeed upon a level plane
but upon another and less inclined plane
than the one on which it will stop i say it
must of a certainty slip back in the first
case put it must slip back altogether on
the inclined plane-when it arrives at such
an inclination as to stop the machine alto-
gether-it is palpable that the progressive
motion is equal to the slipping back there
is a progressive motion arising from the
turning of the wheels and- a slipping back
arising from the inclined plane

   in this extreme case it slips back al-
together now in the other case i say
the slipping back will be in proportion
greater or less according to the weight to be
dragged up and the inclination of the plane
if my position be true-and i am not con-
scious of any fallacy in it-is there no mode
of ascertaining it i say there is

    the number of the strokes of the piston
compared with the progressive motion will
prove that an engine has slipped back if
the entire distance traveled by the engine
does not equal the distance as shown by
the multiplication of the circumference of
the wheels by the number of strokes of the
piston it is clear the engine must have
slipped back do not they know this

  why i did but ask mr stephenson

 do you go up an inclined planep  oh
said he  i know what you are after-there
is no slipping back then i say why do
you not count the strokes of the piston and
give us the means of ascertaining whether
you are right or wrong  

  but what must the committee think of
a witness who says  it cannot be so and
yet will not make a decisive experiment to
prove whether he be right or wrong i
will however show by the evidence now
given by one of our witnesses that mr
stephenson is sadly mistaken

bound hed make her slip

    the committee will recollect that these
experimentalists did count the strokes in the
first experiment and they say that they did
not cpunt the strokes of the second this
gentleman did so and if i am right the
second experiment will confirm my view of
the case  if i am wrong it will not

  let us try they say there were 

strokes of the piston in going up the first
time which will cause a certain progressive
motion every person knows that the pro-
portion of the diameter to the circumference
of a circle is about  the wheels
were four feet in diameter if so 
strokes of the piston which would pro-
duce  turnings of these wheels would
give j feet according to that the
machine would have gone the distance of
j feet but inasmuch as the distance
was a mile and a quarter the actual pro-
gressive motion was only  feet

    it follows that diere was a slipping back
in ascending  feet the engine must
have slipped back to that extent it had
thirteen wagons behind it now observe
what it did during the second experiment
with only eight wagons behind it this
would produce a less retardation and this
young gentleman has shown that when there
were only eight wagons behind it the same
distance was accomplished in  strokes of
the piston and consequently there was then
only a slipping back of k

  would have her slide both ways

  now to what is it that the committee
can attribute the additional slipping except
to the greater weight behind the engine
this is the state of facts in ascending in
descending it is different when die weight
is behind then the whole weight slides
forward together it is palpable then that
the weight behind neither accelerates nor
retards the engine the consequence is that
the engine runs as it were alone down the
plane but it has the whole weight attached
to it and acting upon it when it goes up
does not this again confirm and is con-
firmed by what this young gentleman has
stated viz that in descending in bodi ex-
periments the strokes of the piston are
equal

  where the same circumstances occur
they are equal but where there is a weight
dragging behind there is a slipping propor-
tionate to that weight and i put this fact
against all their theory there are none
so blind as those who will npt see none so
foolish as those who will not make experi-
ments to show that their hypothesis is
wrong

    they say all this is due to a slip arising
from a turn in the railroad but is not the
turn there equal whether there are eight
wagons or twelve even admitting that any
first fight for a railway



turn does exist thereabout respecting which
there are contradictory statements i say
also that the turn will equally apply to the
ascent as to the descent but in point of
fact the engine slips backward in going
up and forward in going down

some legal hair-splitting

   does not that show the nature of the
adhesion of the engine to the railroad and
that mr rastrick is not correct in his view
of the case it is palpable upon the face
of this transaction that a great deal of jock-
eyship has been used to make those ex-
periments

    mr rastrick said tiiat he casually met
an engiije with four-foot wheels whereas
when that respectable gentleman mr wood
was called he said that it had been pre-
pared and the railroad had been prepared
and the experiment had been prepared and
now it appears diat not only had they pre-
pared what experiments they would make
but also those which they would not make
a more uncandid mode of making experi-
ments i think could not be especially
when they do not examine mr cubitt the
only disinterested person

   so much then for these experiments
which i cannot help thinking very falla-
cious but i agree that these engines have
been in use some time at an average speed
of three and a half to four and a half miles
an hour that is a fact which no one can
dispute

   i do not mean to say upon a better
investigation of the matter that these en-
gines might not be made to go at the rate
of five or six miles an hour which only now
go from three and a half to four miles an
hour but i am satisfied the committee will
not act upon mere surmise and conjecture
in the case of an experiment the fire is
properly kept up and to show how material
that is i appeal to mr palmers experi-
ment he proved that the strokes of the
piston varied from thirty-six to fifty-seven
in the course of thirteen minutes

    afraid engine would catch cold

  what does this show it shows that it
is necessary to keep up the fire very care-
fully and that the various accidental causes
to which it is exposed may reduce its speed
in thirteen minutes to one-half therefore
when my learned friends are talking of the

   	rr

experiments being a criterion of the average
speed at which these engines can go i say
it is not a fair criterion and i say there is
no evidence upon which the committee can
safely rely that upon an average more
than three and a half or four and a half
miles an hour can be made

   consider the nature of an engine it
consists in part of a large iron boiler and
the elastic force of steam is the moving
force and that depends upon the quantity
of heat the water is enclosed in a boiler of
iron a most rapid conductor of heat and
which must move in storms of snow in
storms of rain and during the times of
frost at all these times it will be ex-
tremely difficult to keep up the elastic force
of the steam i do not say it is impossible
but extremely difficult

   the common engine is different there
the weight of the atmosphere is brought into
play but then it would be too cumbersome
for the purposes to which these engines are
appropriated

   now sir i say there will be great diffi-
culty in keeping up the elastic force-and
the circumstances brought out in examina-
tion confirm it-for it appears that those
engines have coverings for the purpose of
preventing the heat escaping they are
obliged in the short distance they go on the
collieries to carry either wooden or woolen
coverings this shows the rapidity of the
escape of the heat and perhaps that does
not wholly prevent it

dangers of too much coal

  why one shovelful of coal put on the
fire at an improper time would reduce the
number of strokes of the piston from fifty to
thirty these are circumstances which can-
not occur at the time of the experiment
but they will occur when you have careless
men to deal with it is just as certain that
you will not have always careful men as
it is certain that you will not have perfect
railways-in spite of what mr stephenson
has stated

  then as to-the danger oh says the
maker of these engines they are perfectly
safe why did you ever know a manu-
facturer to declare his engines dangerous
or a gunpowder-maker to say that his pow-

client for the more complete accommodation
of the public and the greater security of
persons passing along said railway as well
as for the better management of the under-
taking that all locomotive and other move-
able engines employed on the same railway
or tram-road should be constructed on the
most improved principles and in the most
substantial manner

    it is not my opinion alone but thus out
of their own mouths i judge them but we
have been told they are safe what is the
meaning of safety it depends upon cir-
cumstances a loaded gun is a safe thing
in the hands of a gamekeeper but who
would say it was a safe thing to leave in a
house with children

   anything may be safe in the hands of a
careful man but in the hands of careless
and obstinate and self-willed people noth-
ing is safe but the question is will an
accident if it happens produce great mis-
chief that is really the criterion by which
to judge safety but say my learned friends
we have got a lock-up safety-valve the
only thing that was wanted to give perfect
security

  now what is the danger from the ordi-
nary safety-valve why this when a
man is anxious to get on more rapidly than
he should he loads the safety-valve and
wilfully exposes himself to danger

   then i ask if it is not true that the
lock-up valve is in his power no says
my learned friend the rivets are fastened
on the inside who cleans the machine
why this careless man by a hole at the
end he can enter through that hole and
when he is in what is to prevent him from
undoing the rivets and enable him to load
the valve

   in a stationary engine it may be dif-
ferent there the master of the place is
about the engine and he may adopt means
of proving that the machine is safe at any
precise period of time but what is true of
a machine which is under perpetual in-
spection of a master is not applicable to an
engine under different circumstances this

is a specimen of the real care which engine-
makers have for their clients

   i say then there is nothing proved that
any practical advantage can be attained by
the railroad in point of speed over the
canal it is clear that up to four and a
quarter miles the advantage is equal but
there is no distinct evidence to show that
steam-engines will make a greater speed

  george stephenson the perfecter of the
steam-engine was next examined after
telling who he was and how he had been
employed he said that since he commenced
business he had constructed fifty-five steam-
engines of which sixteen were locomotives
he knew of a locomotive engine in leeds
which was worked by a cogged wheel fitting
into ratches in the rail he considered this
method useless and accordingly all his en-
gines were constructed to run without such
a device he thought locomotive engines a
better means of conveyance than canals be-
cause they were cheaper and safer

  mr stephenson testified

  a locomotive engine may be as safe as
a condensing engine by making the boiler
proportionably strong to the pressure it has
to bear it may also be kept in order as
easily as a common engine and the safety-
valve may be kept from derangement by the
engineer

   my experience has taught me that such
engines can be built with safety and that
the boiler may be constructed stout enough
to resist atmospheric pressure and that of
the steam such engines can be driven with
perfect safety at a speed of from five to six
miles an hour

   on such a road as the liverpool and
manchester i have recommended eight miles
an hour with twenty tons and four miles an
hour with ferty tons i am quite confident
that much more might be done those en-
gines when in motion are very easily man-
aged-much easier than a horse

   they can be stopped in a quarter of a
minute and even less than that they can
be stopped as quickly as you could stop a
stage-coach

   oh come off  i re-

of a catch about me work-

the same is found in beds or sheet-like

   generally speaking coal beds were

  ill take your word for it i inter-

  very well he said but this-is
what im trying to get at on the train i
had a talk with a professor magillicuddy
we had a session from the colorado line
to kansas city hes a geologist from
rocky ford stone county missouri we
classified and stratified this whole western
country as we came through and ive got
a scheme to make you and me live happy
ever after ever study up any on port-
land cement never mind youd have it
all hopelessly mixed if you had

  portland cement is so-called from its
color which resembles portland stone a
famous oolitic limestone quarried at west-
cliff england portland cement is com-
posed of carbonate of lime in conjunction
with a certain chalky clay found in differ-
ent places the only thing requisite is to
find your deposit of the necessary ingredi-
ents build a mill to grind mix and burn
your cement and then you can sit back and
stamp  paid  on the bills of your custom-
ers when they mail you the checks

  portland cement sells like flour and
tobacco and creamery butter its a staple
commodity magillicuddy and i figured
and measured and puzzled over the geo-
logical formations of oklahoma pretty
severely we finally located a deposit of
the before-mentioned materials for making
cement somewhere within twenty or thirty
miles of this place wakickewa where
youre slaving your life away for a mere
pittance

   the truck is here somewhere horace
we traced the stratums and the general
layout of the geographical aspect until
we can almost lav our hands on the stuff

   thats some science i said admir-
ingly to figure it out that fine and never
even see the locality but it seems to me
id have rather located a gold-field or a
diamond mine while i was at it a clay
bank is sort of-er-tame dont you
think

  theres anint of money in it though
he maintained stoutly well organize a
company and build a plant thatll employ
thousands of men and think of the work
it will provide all over the country for
men to mix and lay concrete buildings
walks walls pavements monuments-its
a great benevolent enterprise providing
work for your fellow men horace dyou
know where i can hire a pony to ride ill
get busy prospecting

  i referred him to the entire village of
wakickewa and its adjacent rural en-
virons and told him to hire any pony that
he thought would fill the bill there were
several to pick from no doubt if hed take
the trouble to look em up

  pleased with my masterly insight my
quick perception and presence of mind et-
cetera honk started out to secure a steed
an hour or so later he returned in the 
company of a rattv-looking lop-eared plug
of a dull mauve color and of a thinness bor-
dering on transparency

  you wouldnt exactly call this horse
pretty he said marking my mild amuse-
ment  but i got him reasonable im to
feed him for the use of him

   something on the order of a mine i
said you have to develop the property
before you can realize anything on it id
be careful of him if i were you i advised
he has a mean eye

  honk laid in a supply of oats corn hay
bran and condition powders and quartered
his palfrey in the tumbledown stock-pen
some roods to the southard of the depot
daily thereafter he jogged promiscuously
over the surrounding landscape of hills and
hollows in the quest for his cement-mine

  sometimes he left at daybreak and did
not return until after dark he seemed to
get a great deal of enjoyment out of the
thing his horse being regularly fed and
watered-a state of affairs that had that
half-starved animal guessing no doubt-
began to pick up in flesh and moult his coat
of unkempt wool

  a day came when dobbin bloomed out
in a sleek summer suit of dappled gray
he was as capery and proud as if hed sud-
honk and horace



denly fallen heir to a pedigree and he
simply neighed by honk-which proves
that the equine heart is reached via the
stomach same as a mans

  dobbin never had much use for me
though he had a way of rolling his eyes
and cocking one ear at me like hed just
as lief as not slip me a couple of hoof-
prints to remember him by

  soon after honks arrival we fitted up
the freight-room of the wakickewa depot
for light housekeeping we put in a cook-
ing-stove table two chairs and a line of
skillets and pans bought at a farm sale for
about one bar of a popular song -then we
built a pullman section to sleep in from
odds and ends of boxes and lumber and
with a borrowed saw and hammer

  it was far more homelike than boarding
and not nearly so expensive by purchas-
ing eggs butter milk etc from the tim-
othy-chewing denizens of the neighboring
hills we saved the middlemans profit my

forty-five dollars a month was the sole
resource of the concern at that particular
time and as honks equine protege was
eating eighty cents worth of feed a day it
didnt take a graduate of a business college
to determine the end of the horn from which
we were going to emerge in the course of
time if we had good luck

   of course i have a considerable stake
-about six hundred plunks-salted away
on a time certificate of deposit drawing four
per cent honk reassured me  but when
we find our cement-mine site well need
that so for the present you can handle
the running expenses horace thatll be
our part of the undertaking

  all right i said but i hate to
work hard day in and day out foregoing
my champagne and cigars and other little
luxuries of-life just to fatten up a glass-
eyed horse that doesnt even look at me
with respectful civility

  day after day honk rode forth blithe-

honk had captured a without visible means
of support of the first magnitude


the railroad mans magazine

house to-night id sigh drearily and
then honk would gaze grimly out of the
window and say no more

  wed been slopping along in this manner
nearly a month when the family in the
wakickewa station was augmented by one
one more mouth to feed-and i was still
getting forty-five a month it happened
suddenly as the man said when lightning
struck him

ive noticed that most things of any con-
sequence do happen all in the twinkling of
an eye head-on collisions earthquakes
elopements panics-even fame and fortune

someiy and night after night he reviewed
the progress made he was ever on the
verge of nailing the great discovery that
was to make wakickewa famous and us
rich but somehow he never actually lit
on the exact spot

occasionally the conversation reverted to

i fed him chicken

broth with a

spoon

valhalla-a subject on which honk was
particularly vindictive

   the transcontinental played you a low-
down scurvy trick hed growl but i
got even with em i quit em cold i left
em in the soup plenty and proper they
sent out a high-schooled kid to take charge
when i quit you know some chump with
a brain like a chocolate eclair but kin to
the directorate i presume no doubt hes
got valhalla on the greased slide that leads
to oblivion ere this at least i hope he has
why horace-

   id like to be back in the old medicine

or disgrace and bankruptcy as the case may
be may overtake and smother you in a
single night

  honk set out that morning with his re-
sponsibilities burdening him but lightly
he whistled a ragtime tune and said he
was intending to ride some twenty miles
or so that day

   i feel it in my bones that to-days the
day we strike pay - dirt he remarked
 watch for us coming over the hill and
have a good supper ready horace and
say-by jinks let me have what chew-
ing youve got in your pocket will you
honk and horace



i forgot to get any and youre here handy
you can run across to the store any time

  i surrendered what i had but i made
him ride alongside the platform to get it
i also had a feeling in my bones-about
being kicked in the face by a gray horse

  somewhere near four oclock my glance
rested on the distant road winding to the
top of the hill i saw honk returning-
on foot he was plodding beside his goodly
charger on whose back was perched an un-
couth figure the progress of the caval-
cadc was slow i had plenty of time for
speculation as to what had happened be-
fore they came up whatever conclusion
i arrived at before they did howeter fell
considerably short of the actuality

  honk to all intents and purposes had
captured a  without visible means of sup-
port of the first magnitude a weary
willie of the purest ray serene the man
was about my size and hed had a shave
within the week but his general appearance
was desultory not to say helter-skelter

  he had no hat his coat was rent and
torn his trousers dirt-caked and speckled
with clinging weed-seeds and-most no-
ticeable of all-his clothing from the waist
down was soaked with dark stains that
looked like blood

  the pallor of his face and hands seemed
to indicate that the blood had come out of
his own supply and the man was clinging
to the saddle only by good luck so far
as any tenacity or dogged purpose was con-
cerned he might just as well have fallen
off a time or two coming down the hill
there wasnt anything to prevent him

  i took his shoulders and honk the lower
half of him and we lugged him into our
drawing-room where he promptly fainted
and forgot his troubles

  well i said surveying the exhibit
what is it and whered you get it is
that the pay-dirt you spoke about

  found him about ten miles from here
honk said he was bleeding to death
from a gunshot wound in the left leg an
artery clipped-maybe the femural i
couldnt tell i tied it with a twine string
hes badly hurt all right hed have forded
the dark river in a little while longer if i
hadnt found him when i did it was a
lucky-

  who is he i asked who shot
him 

 since you mention it i dont believe
he gave me his name and address i be-

lieve he said lie was out deer-hunting and
his horse threw him off in a thicket and
broke away from him and a tree-limb got
tangled up with his rifle which went off
and did the rest now- you know all i
know

  i was engaged in heating water and
preparing bandages by the time honk con-
cluded i afterward found that id torn
up one of honks best shirts in my hurry

   he looks like an undesirable citizen
to me i said  but of course well do what
we can for him is the bullet in his leg

  nope said honk it went on over
in the next count must have been a 
from the looks of the hole it made i won-
der if willie has croaked lie added stoop-
ing to examine the still form on the floor
 if he has   call it ungrateful of him
after me bringing him ten miles to save
him

  i knocked off bandage-making until he
determined whether or not the man had
slipped off his mortal coil and ducked
across the river while wed been parleying
he hadnt he was still  our side of the
creek and hadnt double-crossed honk so
we set about red-crossing him according
to the best authorities on backwoods
surgery

  this process being neither thrilling
amusing nor heart-interesting theres no
use trying to work it off as literature pass
it up

  by sundown we had willie the waif bol-
stered and bandaged up in lower  with
his breath smelling of  bitters and a wan
smile enlivening his waxen facial expres-
sion as i fed him chicken broth with a
spoon he had fallen in the hands of the
samaritans

  that night as well as several succeed-
ing ones honk and i flipped nickels to see
whod occupy the upper berth and whod
sleep on the baggage-truck

  our patient recovered his health and
strength without any serious complications
or delay within a week he was able to
hobble around  the crutches honk made
for him out of a couple of pitchfork han-
dles he was able to hold down his end
of the eating long before that

  between willie and dobbin i could see
the poorhouse staring me in the face the
man didnt seem in any hurry when lie
attained the convalescent stage his com-
plete recovery seemed to hang fire at that
point he just sat around with his whole


the railroad mans magazine

vital energy and being focused on eating
it was like trying to fill the proverbial
barrel with both ends knocked out to satisfy
that mans craving for food

  at no time during this period did willie
disturb himself about volunteering any in-
formation regarding his former life or his
ambitions and plans for the future

  he appeared to like the place my cook-
ing pleased him and nothing seemed to be
crowding to the man up the tree it
looked very much like willie had fallen
into what is commonly termed a pud-
ding i mentioned this phase of the sit-
uation to honk one evening when i had
come away from a cleaned supper - table
still hungry

   you and your horse and your anony-
mous friend from nowhere seem to think
im santa claus i said you three are
having the time of your lives-at my ex-
pense what do you take me for anyhow
lady bountiful or what

   my dear horace said honk with a
pained look  are you tired of seeing me
around if so ill go horace ill pull
out to-morrow

   you neednt commence to cry about it
i continued unmoved  because your tears
wont affect me in the least and if the
three of you think you can blandy me into
feeding you on and on here forever with-
out a word of protest youd better consult
a specialist thats all youve got some-
thing the matter with you that needs look-
ing after im not running no foundlings
home

  we wrangled about it for quite a while
honk said hed taken a liking to the fel-
low whose life hed saved although he
didnt know much about the mans history

  he said he thought it was no more than
common humanity for us to get the fellow
on his feet again before we turned him out
as for dobbin the horse-he declared that
a few days at most would settle the ques-
tion of the clay-deposit he was bound to
find it now most any time-and then dob-
bins services would be  longer required

   possess your soul in patience my boy
he said just for a few days longer and
then well have the world by the tail well
look back in days to come and laugh about
this period of depression itll be a great
joke

   ha ha  i barked mirthlessly
 ill look back and see what a gump i was
when im drumming at back doors for

handouts but all right ive got a dol-
lar or two left and next thursdays pay-
day ill see you all through

  willie the waif was getting able to walk
pretty well on his game leg he took a
marked interest in honk- and his multitu-
dinous schemes and theories they got as
chummy as two old soldiers on the same
park-bench

  honk explained and enlarged and ex-
pounded telling what he and i could and
would do if we had half a chance and
vowing that wed scare up a chance or
leave it in such a fix that nobody else would
-while willie listened he was the best
listener i ever saw

  i think it was this happy faculty in the
man of evincing a breathless interest in
everything id tell him that finally en-
deared him to me hed sit by the hour
without saying a word and let me tell him
what a crackerjack i was i taught him
how to play several new games of single-
handed cards or solitaire and in return
hed mind the station for me while i went
fishing

  life doesnt trickle along in a certain
gutter forever though and one day a letter
came for honk that upset the routine it
was from his scientific traveling-compan-
ion professor magillicuddy and it put a
sudden and summary quietus on honks
search for the chalky-clay deposit that was
to lift us out of our morass

   i have gone over our joint calculations
and conclusions said the professor  and
i find that a serious fault exists in- so
and so and so forth and so on

  there were three or four pages of tire-
some details to sum up he said that the
cement-mine wasnt in the vicinity of wa-
kickewa-at all instead it would be found
somewhere in the township range and sec-
tion adjoining the town of websters cross-
roads in central kansas

  honk fumed and swore and tore his
thatch for upward of an hour later he re-
lapsed into a melancholy silence that ex-
tended through the orgy of supper he ate
little or nothing

  even willie lacked something if his usual
gusto and enthusiasm for food these
alarming symptoms in my two best board-
ers so affected me that i made a sneak
across to the store and bought a can of
salmon some sweet - mixed pickles and
crackers to accompany em with the idea of
tempting their wavering appetites
honk and horace



  they perked up enough to devour these
tidbits but the same did not dispel honks
gloom

  well he growled finally i guess ill
dig out of this one-horse burg theres noth-
ing here for me i believe ill hit for
panama or the philippines or alaska-

   or bombay or bloemfontein i sug-
gested

  at this point willie broke a three-days
silence he swallowed the last bite of the
only remaining pickle reached for a cracker
and remarked

  what do you want to go away for
aint we living easy here  

  -honk gawked at him for a minute with-
out speaking when he  did speak i
thought i detected a- tinge of irony in his
tone

  hear that horace he sneered
aint we living easy wouldnt that
spoof you sitting around here mooching
our grub and then brag about living easy
thats too much thats rubbing it in
aint we living easy  waugh   and honk
clapped his hat on and flung himself out
the door toward the stock-pen where we

heard him jerking and kicking the sur-
prised dobbin to an accompaniment of
brutal  whoas  and  standaroundtheres 
and finally we heard him leading the
horse away

  willie pondered the matter over in his
mind for a considerable spell without au-
dible comment he seemed reluctant about
coming to any definite conclusion but the
fact had apparently penetrated his skull
at length that wakickewa wasnt a home
for little wanderers

  he too reached for his hat-one honk

had given him-and after thinking the
matter over moved toward the door

   so-long friend he said  i guess
ive wore out my welcome here so ill be
hitting the grit

  which way you think youll go wil-
lie i asked unconcernedly

  north he returned briefly ill
walk to cotton junction six miles and
catch a freight on the katy maybe
nonsense i said you neednt be
in such a hurry you can get a train out
of here about daylight ill square it for
you with the con

my own experience drill-
ing along a forlorn
stretch of weed-grown
track moved me to a
feeling of pity


the railroad mans magazine

for the first time in the history
of wakickewa the flier
stopped there

  but no not a minute would lie wait
he was one of these guys that hang fire
on a decision a long time but when they
do cut loose they go all at once

  i followed him along the platform to
the mail-stand there we shook hands and
murmured our sad farewells he limped
off up the track the cinders crunching un-
der his worn-out shoes it was dark and
lonely something of my own experience
drilling along a forlorn stretch of weed-
grown track moved me to a feeling of pity

  wait a minute willie i called and
trotted after him

  works hard to find i said kind of
embarrassedly  even when a fellows hunt-
ing for it and the world is a cold un-
feeling place to be in when youre up
against it take this i said pressing
something in his hand  itll come handy
maybe before you get where youre going
it was a ten-dollar bill i had plenty
of other uses for it but i figured tljat if
he should hang around wakickewa another
month hed get its value anyhow so i might
as well fork it over

  he displayed some emotion for once ill
say diat it got away with him first i
thought he was going to refuse to take it
but he kind of grinned foolishly and choked
up and said hed pay it back and all the
sort of stuff people say on the spur of the
moment-and then he tucked it away in
his ragged raiment like anybody would
and philandered on his weary way

  honk slouched in during the next hour
and said hed returned the good steed dob-
bin to its legal owner thereby ridding us
of one needless expense i thanked him
kindly later i mentioned that willie had
gone off in a huff at his thoughtless remarks
after supper

   im glad of it honk said cheerfully
we couldnt have him around here for-
ever hed eat us out of house and home
the monumental nerve of the guy any-
how huh youre too easy-going hor-
ace youd have let him stay here till
christmas if i hadnt taken the initiative
to-morrow im going to see about starting
a shingle-mill here in wakickewa

  honks buoyant spirits had returned i
honk and horace



was glad of that for i do like to be around
a sorehead-not

  at four-thirty the following afternoon a
startling thing happened

  for the first time in the history of wa-
kickewa the flier stopped there-actually
paused in her headlong dash for the south
and let us see what she looked like she
frequently whistled for our town but fifty
miles an hour was as near as shed ever
come to slowing down during my reign

  on this momentous occasion she actually
came to a dead standstill not only that
but a gold-braided brakeman swung off
opened the rusty switch and without  by
your leave  or anything gave em two
fingers daintily and they backed a pala-
tial private car into our siding

  leaving the same they scooted out on
the main line again his grace relocked
the switch and away they went in a shower
of cinders and a flutter of pink ribbons

  the car was the  ourmaline -parlor
library boudoir buffet etc her shades
were drawn but we noticed the gentleman
of color in white who had charge of the
sub-cellars peeking out of the diamond-
shaped window in his department

  another chromatic gentleman the porter
showed himself on the brass piazza and
undid the portcullis and then-honk and
i were all a twitter with excitement dye
mind a natty personage in a correct busi-
ness suit dropped off and limping slightly
came over to where we watched and waited

  it was our late boarder willie

  willie but oh my all haberdashed
and groomed up like the fairy prince he
was the fairy prince in fact for hed-
come to propose to us a proposition to
square up his hospital and board bills as
it were

   honk and horace he said shaking
hands and slapping us on our backs  my
two good friends-listen to me i owe you
boys more than ill ever be able to pay
you saved my life you nursed me boarded
and lodged me and loaned me money
neither knowing nor caring who i was

   but i was studying you fellows all the
time i found out a lot of things besides
having the time of my life i found two
men that i can tie to i do not regret my
accident nor how near it came to getting me
nor anything else since it was the means of
my finding the two men i want im not
paying my debt very well-its more like
the other way around-but well- i hap-

pen to be the president of a big trunk line-
one of the biggest in the country

  he read my thoughts at that moment for
he looked at me grinned and said

  oh i got word to my friends all right
the second day after you boys cobbled me
up i used your wire horace while you
went to the store i told them to keep
away and let me alone i was on a lark

  but heres what im trying to say
there chances to be on our line a growing
little city it is lively and up-to-date and
in the midst of a prosperous section we
have large interests there and we need a
couple of wide-awake young fellows like
you two to handle the companys end of
everything

   the salaries for such work would be-
he named a sum for each of us that sounded
like there was something to it after all
it was more money than i could spend at
a moments notice

  i looked at honk honk looked at me

        little red shack built close to the
                 track

with a window in either end

a little red door and ten feet of floor
and plenty of switches to tend

           a little old mn with only one hand
 and a little old pipe made of clay

       little old smile trom old erins isle--
       a happy old fellow all day

and a

  in that little shack built close to the track

  there are memories of bygone years

  when youth and its prime was all summer-time
  now gone amid sorrow and tears

  when this little man with only one hand

  in the days of the old link and pin

  while coupling up cars was caught in the bars
  and the iron hand of fate  turned him in

  in that little shack turn lifes pages back

  when youth to success looked ahead

  since those balmy days the futures bright rays
  have changed like the hair on his head

  as he sits there to-night in the glare of the light
  that shines through the little stove-door

  you can easily trace by the lines on his face
  the sadness and gladness of yore

  when you come along and the switches are wrong
  and the lights all around you are red

  dont curse and abuse and shout and misuse
  have respect for that weary gray head

  for that little man with only one hand
  may soon pass away from your view

  and the iron hand of fate may not hesitate
  to make a switch-tender of you

keeping house for the railroads

by tom jackson

 what do you suppose a housewife would do who finds the cares and
 responsibilities of a nine-room cottage a burden if she were asked to
 keep house for a railroad  think of the thousands of trains con-
 stantly on the move each a sort of a home in a way requiring many of the
 duties of the ordinary housekeeper to maintain order and comfort keeping
 track of grocery bills and pantry shelves probably ceases to be a feminine occu-
 pation when the bills foot up into the millions and when the greater part of
 the housekeeping is done by well-clrilled clerks clever buyers and shrewd men
 who know how to drive bargains

 facts and figures which show how a railroads household expenses
 compare with those of the average family and which reflect
 credit on mans knowledge of domestic economy

  so much has been said about womans
success in usurping mans occupations it is
no more than fair that attention should be
called to the signal success which railroad
men have achieved in nousekeeping that
housework is extremely well done on any
first-class railroad can be proved upon the
testimony of any traveler thereon

  to begin with that branch of housekeep-
ing of liveliest interest to the traveler name-
ly cooking we find that in one year the
rock island railway served meals to -
 persons in dining-cars and to 
persons in hotels and restaurants operated
by the company that would be equivalent
to cooking for a family of  persons who
not only never missed a meal in the whole
year but which had friends in to dinner on
four hundred and ninety-five occasions



railroad has a great many
other things to do besides
seeing that each traveler
gets a lower berth in a
sleeping-car and testifying
before the inter-state com-
merce commission one of these duties is
the humble but highly important one of
keeping house

  this is not to be taken in a pickwickian
sense but accepted literally every detail
of the round of duties which any good
housekeeper performs daily for her house-
hold is carried out on a railroad system
only on an infinitely greater scale the
work is interesting not merely because of
its magnitude but also because it is car-
ried on not by the sex especially endowed
by nature in that direction but by men


the railroad mans magazine

  the canadian pacific railway has a
much larger family for in addition to its
great mileage and more than usually large
number of hotels it operates fleets of steam-
ships on the atlantic the pacific and the
great lakes and steamboats on the lakes
and rivers of the far west the hotels
serve on an average fifteen thousand meals
daily while the steamship department serves
sixty thousand and the dining-car depart-
ment 

  including shop employees who are sup-
plied with excellent hot lunches at nominal
prices the company serves on an average

	a day in-a year the grand total
foots up  meals to put it an-
other way this would be equivalent to cook-
ing for a family of  persons such
a family would require a city the size of
springfield illinois topeka kansas or
sioux city iowa to house it properly

  it is no sinecure to provide for the great
family of travelers which looks to the rail-
road housekeeper for its sustenance if all
appetites continued at home on the same
scale to which they develop when travel-
ing many a hard-wprking head of a family
would be driven into bankruptcy or a pre-
mature grave to supply the hungry hosts
on one of the big eastern lines one year re-
quired  barrels of flour  beeves

	chickens and  carloads of other
provisions

  no growing cliildever developed a great-
er propensity for a  bite  between meals
than the average railroad passenger the
railroad housekeeper has just as much
trouble providing  bites  for his charges
as any harassed mother even the prodig-
ious quantity of provisions mentioned did
not satisfy the passengers on the road in
question for they also consumed a million
sandwiches a million pounds of fruit and
half a million pounds of candy between
meals

  a hundred thousand meals a day

  this it must be remembered refers only
to what was sold in cars and at railroad
eating-houses and lunch-counters it does
not include the prodigious quantities of
provisions consumed at independent hotels
and lunch-counters on die journeys

  nor is even this all for the railroad
when the average passenger cannot pos-
sibly eat another mouthful he chews gum
just like the troublesome little boy at home

in one year the santa fe gathered -

	pennies from its own slot machines for
vending gum

  two housekeepers out of three are wont
to declare that they dont mind cooking
but that they do hate to wash dishes per-
haps all such persons may be more recon-
ciled to the task of washing their few dozen
dishes daily if they will reflect that the
serving of the canadian pacifics hundred
thousand meals a day entails the washing
in the course of a year of 
pieces of china glass and silverware to say
nothing of the usual proportion of pots nd
pans which are the particular bete ioire
of most housekeepers

  the housework on the canadian pacific
is divided among  employees in hotels
the same number on steamships and  in
the dining-car department which operates
 dining-cars making a total of 
men this however provides for only a
part of the stupendous task tliere still
remain the sleeping-car porters who make
up beds and keep the cars in order on the
road and the army of car-cleaners who per-
form every day what is analogous to the an-
nual house-cleaning of the private home
finally there are the offices to be cared for

driving away the dirt

  some idea of the magnitude of this great
task may be gathered from the fact that in
the fiscal year ending june   -

	cakes of ordinary soap were consumed
in the effort to keep the new york central
clean that same laudable endeavor also
required  common corn brooms -
 rattan-filled brooms  hair floor-
brooms  hair window-brushes and -
 mops

  the santa fe housekeeper uses 
common corn brooms  scrubbing-
brushes and  cases of soap in a year

  in purchasing supplies for such exten-
sive operations the railroad housekeeper
must exercise the most rigid economy this
means that life is one long bargain-day for
the purchasing-agent whose sole duty it is
to buy the articles required for keeping a
railroad in order for ordinary supplies
under normal condition no bids are asked
the purchasing-agent is obliged to know
to the fraction of a cent how much thecur-
rent prices on standard articles can be
shaved

sometimes the supply dealers get togedier
keeping house for the railroads



in secret conclave and sign an iron-clad
agreement with dire penalties for violations
thereof to keep prices up but that does not
worry the purchasing-agent for he knows
from long experience that before the ink is
dry on the agreement each of the parties
thereto will be making surreptitious calls
by way of the back entrance to quote him
inside prices several notches lower than
those named by the combine

work that is never done

  as soon as the supplies are paid for the
purchasing-agents responsibilities end the
supplies are shipped to the general store-
keeper who distributes them among the di-
vision storekeepers who in their turn dole
them out to members of the army of help
which does the housework not so much as
a cake of soap can be issued without a
requisition signed by the constituted author-
ity who may be almost any one connected
with the road according to the circum-
stances of the case

  when supplies run out at division stores
the storekeeper himself makes out a requi-
sition which he then starts on its travels by
easy stages up to headquarters by the time
it reaches the purchasing-agent it bears sig-
natures enough to stock an autograph al-
bum and has been checked and altered and
had notations entered upon it until it looks
like a war map at the end of a hard cam-
paign in the course of time though the
storekeeper will get his supplies and the
housekeepers work which is never done
on a railroa-d any more than it is anywhere
else continues on its weary round

regulation car cleaning

  as an example of the cost of railroad
housework it may be said that the rock
island system in the fiscal year ending
june   spent  on pas-
senger-cars alone that the thoroughness
of the work may be properly appreciated
it may be well to give some details the
housework is uniform all over the system
car-cleaners are not permitted to exercise
discretion but are required to work up to
a uniform and exacting standard this
applies to all first-class railroads

  when a rock island car comes from a
run it is sent to the cleaning tracks where
all the windows doors and ventilators are
opened and all matting carpets upholstered

seats and back-rests are taken out for me-
chanical cleaning

  the car is then very thoroughly swept
or if it be at any of the more important
places it is blown out with compressed air
next the floor is scrubbed with soap and
water to which lye or some other cleaning
agent has been added after this the floor
is mopped with a one per cent solution of
formalin which is the ordinary thirty-five
per cent solution of formaldehyde to des-
troy all lurking disease germs the job is
finished by wiping all arm-rests window-
ledges the panels between windows and the
walls of the car with a damp cloth

  head-linings which are the interior sur-
faces of the car roofs and other inside fin-
ish are cleaned every three months or often-
er if necessary with asponge and a weak
solution of soap and distilled water they
are then dried with chamois skin and
rubbed down with renovating oil and white
waste cuspidors and other sanitary con-
veniences are rigidly disinfected with for-
malin after a thorough scrubbing

with the day-coaches

  water-coolers are washed out after every
trip-a rule which might advantageously be
copied in many an office platforms not
covered with rubber and floors of coaches
not carpeted by aisle-stripsare painted with
floor composition at least once in six
months and as much oftener as may be
necessary steam-pipes are bronzed or
painted as often as may be necessary and
iron hand-rails are painted black at least
once every three months all brasswork is
cleaned with oxalic acid whiting and wa-
ter and polished with putz pomade as often
as necessary to keep it in good order

  besides the cars there are on the rock
island system upward of two thousand
buildings consisting of office shop and
station buildings hotels and eating sta-
tions and interlocking plants to be kept
clean and in order by a force of janitors
employed for that purpose and entirely in-
dependent of the car-cleaners to say noth-
ing of about  section-houses in which
section-men employed in track-work live
and which are kept in order by their fam-
ilies altogether it takes  worth of
soap to keep the rock island clean for a
year

  the good housekeeper whether in a pri-
vate home or on a great railroad system


the railroad mans magazine 

must keep refrigerators properly cleaned
and filled with ice and a supply of drink-
ing-water always on hand on the rock
island this requires  tons of ice a
year which costs on an average  a ton

   then there is the coal bill a serious mat-
ter anywhere the rock island uses for
heating purposes some  tons of an-
thracite a year at an approximate cost of
 this however by no means cov-
ers the entire consumption of fuel for heat-
ing cars and stations as at some points bi-
tuminous coal is used the account for which
is not kept separate from the fuel bill for
locomotives at some stations heat is sup-
plied by a steam plant which uses bitu-
minous coal

  railroad wash-days a week long

  wash-day is just as important and just
as troublesome for the railroad housekeeper
as any other housekeeper only on the
railroad there is so much washing to do it
can never be finished on mondays but must
be continued through every da of the week
and every week in the year and the rail-
road housekeeper cannot mitigate the
drudgery of wash-day by serving a boiled
dinner the hungry travelers who consti-
tute his family will not tolerate boiled din-
ners they insist on having just as good
meals on wash-day as on any other day

  a railroads washing includes a long list
of articles to meet the requirements of sleep-
ing dining and official cars hotels and
offices household linen is used more free-
ly than is necessary in the case of a small

family for instance a sleeping-car takes
out for a run of a single night a suit of
linen consisting of a hundred each of sheets
pillow-cases and towels

  on most american railroads the laundry
bills for the sleeping-cars are paid by the
pullman company which operates the cars
but even with this important reduction
any one of the larger standard systems
would be glad to get off with a laundry bill
of  a year it costs the canadian
pacific which operates its own sleeping-
cars and a fleet of fifty-four steamships and
steamboats and a long list of hotels five
times that amount

a valuable junk-pile

  like his cottage prototype die railroad
housekeeper drives many a sharp bargain
with the ragman on the railroad how-
ever the ragman does not arrive with horse
and wagon in the last stages of senility
heralded by a string of discordant cow-
bells no indeed he comes with a full
train of flat cars and even at that he has
to make many trips to gather up all the old
rails old wire old pipe broken castings
worn-out locomotives and other macliinerv
and discarded ties

  when he took his last train load away
from the new york central lines last year
he left that company richer by the tidy sum
of ss which it must be admit-
ted would furnish a generous allowance of
pin money for a good many housekeepers
the santa fes junk swells the receipts of
the company  a year

importing railroad ties

railways are face to face with the rather
dismal fact that ties are beginning to be
imported to this country forest-fires the prodi-
gal waste of forest timber is in a large measure
responsible and the recent announcement from
washington is very significant that the first con-
signment of railroad ties from australia- to the
united states is on its way to rodondo cali-
fornia the ties being  in number

  owing to the extension of railways in the los
angeles section and the constant rehabilitation
of established lines a large percentage of the ties
used there are from the california redwood-trees

  at one time quantities of oak-ties were re-
ceived from japan one steamer alone bringing
over  these were bought at a time when
they were obtainable at an unusually low figure
but when prices arc normal they cost much more

thajv the redwood ties freight included and are
no better

  the redwood ties cost from fifty to eighty
cents each the prices being subject to wide fluctu-
ation the life of this tie is from ten to thirty
years according to the character of the soil in
which it is placed an untreated pine tie lasts
from five to six years

  last year there was an increase of ten per cent
in the number of ties laid laf this country as
compared with the preceding year the total being
 which cost 

  it is significant that in   ties
were bought for new track as against 
in  and  in  during the first-
named year oak continued to lead by a wide
margin all other kinds of wood used for cross-ties

we meet  level larry

ow the newly appointed po-
lice commissioner wishing to
give excuse for his official
existence caused a general
and totally unnecessary shake-
up in the department one
of its consequences was the transfer of ser-
geant lawrence phelan-known to his ac-
quaintances of the upper- and underworld
from the financial district at headquarters
as level larry

 when the news was announced the
street lifted up its voice and dictated
to its typewriters and sent multitudes of ex-
postulating and protesting letters to mul-
berry street where the power behind the
shake-up was then located sergeant phe-
lan had served well and truly for seven
years below the dead line during that
period he had done much to keep the dis-
trict clean of crooks he was the unceas-
ing enemy of those who rented offices and
those who didnt there were not wanting
occasions when his bank - account might
have increased had his sense of duty di-
minished but the ingrained integrity of the

	rr	t

 man militated against even the slightest
 consideration of such opportunities level
 larry came as honestly by his sobriquet as
 he did by his dollars

   a good many of those dollars-in fact
 the bulk of them-were the result of the
 tips and advice that were given him by
 people on the inside with whom he came in
 daily and professional contact indeed
 when the shake-up arrived phelan was the
 owner of a competency the size of which
 would have warranted him in obeying his
 first impulse-to tender his resignation after
 telling the commissioner that he was a
 brass-bound assorted sort of fool or some-
 thing to that effect after talking things
 over with mrs phelan however he did
 not he reflected that in five years time
 he would retire on a pension and that no
 cod-headed superior was worth the sacrifice
 of such a reward

   larry said colonel amos nugent sev-
 eral days before the shake-up went into
 effect what are you going to do with the
 money that youve made down here

   the colonel was a big red-faced man
 from arizona his specialty was mines
 and his delight was trotting horses-the
 former genuine and the latter fast he had
 a peculiar dislike for motor-cars


the railroad-mans magazine

  phelan had earned colonel nugents
gratitude several years before by running
out of the wall street district a gang of
crooks which operated with bogus proper-
ties that were allegedly located in the colo-
nels state the little conversation here
quoted took place in the colonels broad
street office

   upon my soul sir replied the detect-
ive ive given no thought to it tis
safe in the bank at four per cent and there
twill lie till the need comes for using it
 good but a word with you as youve
made the money by the street dont lose it
by the street keep away from us larry
theres much difference between playing a
friendly tip and playing your own judg-
ment the tips that have come your way
have been in return for your professional
favors when youre out of the street
youll be treated just like the every-day
lamb if you come bleating back to these
pastures sure boy so if i were you
id make up my mind to never come below
fulton street with more than the price of
the cigars with me ive given you one or
two good pointers in the past-the best im
giving you now

  larry phelan nodded understandlv

  i believe you sir and whats more
ill abide by what you say

   if ever the time comes that you want
to make an investment went on the colo-
nel  and i know what i am talking about
theres one thing you can put your whole
outfit into-blanket burro and grub-bag-
and feel rock certain that the ball will fall
on your number

  in his youth the colonel had lived in an
atmosphere in which faro and roulette guns
and sudden demises prospects and fortunes
unearthed by the blow of a pickax were
ordinary features

   it sounds good colonel it must be
united states bonds or - or - something
you have in the southwest

  a gleam of humor twinkled in the de-
tectives eye as he spoke

  nope sir neither one nor the other
what i speak of is right here-new york
real estate in localities where business de-
mands the use of what now are private
residences property of this kind yields a
satisfactory return jit the present and will
prove to be an ophir-mount in the future
and the colonel banged his fist on the table
as if to drive home his assertion

  the ophir-mount was the name of the

 colonels favorite and best - paying mine
he put it on the same plane with the eter-
nal verities

   phelans face expressed his entire accord
with the colonels views

   thats the very thought that ive had
these many years he said  in fact the
wife and myself have talked it over and
over but-well we dont want to put
our property-if we had any-into some-
body elses hands and let agents fees and
repairs and fly-by-night tenants and all the
rest of it eat up the profits and perhaps
some of the principal and we dont quite
see how we are to run a house while were
waiting for somebody to come along and
buy it for a store and-

  look here larry interrupted the
colonel you have another talk with mrs
p then if you still think favorably of
the idea from an investment view - point
come to me and ill post you about details
it isnt generally known perhaps  - the
colonel grinned expansively-but ive a
stake in new york properties as well as in
these farther west so im not shooting off
blanks

   sergeant phelan acted on the financiers
advice and three months later he took title
to a four-story-and-basement brownstone
house in the upper forties of manhattan
the house which was a few doors east of
sixth avenue was patterned like unto
-every one of its neighbors on the block the
architecture dating back to the time when
stages ran on lroadway when crinolines
were worn by one sex and dundreary
whiskers by the other

  the phelans furnished the house com-
fortably retaining the basement and sec-
ond floor for their own uses they let the
first floor to a dentist and the rest of the
rooms to men almost all of whom were
friends of the sergeant mrs phelan
who was a thorough housewife and capital
manager made the place pay and her pa-
trons comfortable in spite of the fact that
the first floor seemed to have a hoodoo within
its walls

  the dentist couldnt draw customers-
or rather enough teeth to make a living
there followed him in quick succession a
dressmaker a milliner a health culturist
a teacher of languages a ladies tailor a
dealer in stamps and coins and a profes-
sor of elocution

   after the going of the elocutionist the
floor remained vacant for several weeks
dr jourdans mystery



one day richard robert jourdan md
became its tenant the doctor was young
tall gaunt and homely yet having withal
a pleasant resolute face his chin and
eyes were dominant-the former by reason
of its breadth the latter on the score of
their eagerness somehow or other when
you met dr jourdan you felt that he was
a man of unattained purpose but that at-
tainment surely awaited him

   dr jourdan sat down to build a practise
tedious enough is this process even when
one starts with a nucleus of friends and
relatives soul-trying even heart-breaking
when attempted by a stranger in a strange
land dr jourdan was that so far as new
york was concerned

  however men of his kind make ac-
quaintances  and retain friendships with
equal facility the phelans took to him
from the first mrs phelans motherly
heart went out to him when she found that
there wasnt a soul in the metropolis whom
he knew

  the sergeant liked the plucky cheer-
fulness of the young man and larrys
profession had taught him to pretty accu-
rately estimate those with whom he came
in contact like a majority of big men
his good-will took a practical form it
wasnt long before he began to send stray
patients to his tenant most of whom were
on the force and didnt care for the
ministrations of the departments doctors
luck ch skill or maybe the atmosphere of
wholesomeness that surrounded the young
md caused these initial patients to swear
by him professionally and in other ways

   being benefited they told their story to
other sick ones the practise grew slowly
and steadily mrs phelan finally ex-
pressed her belief to her husband that the
jioodoo had been scared from the first floor
once and for all

   you speak the truth mary said
larry

  now a goodly number of dr jourdans
patients came to his office to be treated so
that his outside practise was corresponding-
ly small the medical profession agrees
i believe that where the sick folk are
mainly men they prefer to go to the doc-
tor whenever possible instead of having the
doctor come to them by reason of the
detectives introductions it was his own
sex to which the doctor chiefly adminis-
tered that is why he was within during
many hours of the day when his shingle

proclaimed him as being without dr jour-
dan usually spent these leisure hours
poring over scientific medical journals
filled with all manner of literature that is
but greek to the layman-

  he is a learned man is dr jour-
dan said the sergeant to his wife  for
the books he gets are in all kinds of lan-
guages and he seems to read em just as
easy as i do orders at headquarters it
must be fine to be able to get away with
italian and dutch and several other kinds
of speech at that one of these days when
we get better acquainted ill mind me to
ask him about his travels abroad that i
know hes took but hes the quiet boy
so he is he never opens his mouth about
himself and his doings maybe that is
the reason i like him most men you meet
are four-flushers that try to fill with a
capital i

  larry got the habit of dropping into the
office during off hours when he and the
doctor talked over the events of the day
the happenings of the past or the promises
of the present during these talks larry
learned that his tenant came from a west-
ern family that he had spent some time
studying in germany and italy and that
he had ideas of his own regarding certain
phases of his profession larry couldnt
understand it all but it impressed him as
being mighty clever

  well sergeant what has taken place
to-day asked the doctor one november
afternoon

  it was larrys relief both men had
taken seats in the little room at the rear
of the office which in the residential days
of the house had been its conservatory but
now served as a den and smoking-room

  nothing at all twas one of the off
days in the business replied the detective
 barring a shooting scrap at the point
and an incendiary in spring street twas
as quiet as fan-tan when the tongs are at
peace

   so   there was a pause

  yep nothing doing young halli-
well was pinched again by a greenhorn
dry-goods man but that doesnt count

  and who is young halliwell asked
the doctor as he refilled his pipe

  for a moment thelan looked at the
other man in amazement then his face
gave token of understanding

   i forgot that you were a newcomer in
these parts he replied  if youd been


the railroad mans magazine

a new yorker you wouldnt have asked
that question the kid and his queerness
is as well known to people hereabouts as
-as-mulberry street itself

  well im hereabouts and i never heard
of halii we  before declared the other
with a laugh tell me all about him
the detective shot a quick glance at his
companion as if to assure himself that he
wasnt being jollied seeing nothing in
the face of the doctor to suggest as much
he settled himself in his chair took a long
puff at his cigar and began

  if youll read the society items of the
newspapers youll get wise to the fact tiiat
the halliwells are among the bigbugs of
the swirl old man halliwell ever since
the war has had em coming his way-
railroad properties mines real estate in-
vestments-oh a bunch of things that
made money for him in heaps married
one of the marryats of boston and so
busted into society then his son george
hitched up to miss knollys of london-
relatives of big nobs on the other side

   that made em more solid than ever
with the swell crowd at newport and bar
harbor and the avenue george also fol-
lowed in papas footsteps on the street and
the family fortunes swelled in consequence
he had a son and a daughter the daugh-
ter is engaged so folk say to some titled
gent in france the son harold now
twenty years old is the chap who was ar-
rested to-day

 why

   he is a nice lad good-looking pleas-
ant manners college-bred and all the rest
of it but hes dippy on one subject he
steals things whenever he can get his hooks
upon them said the detective with pro-
fessional sang-froid

  dr jourdan laid down his pipe and
drew his chair closer to the other while
his eyes gleamed with interest yes he
said  go on a cleptomaniac

  thats the word doc ive heard lots
of people of your business use it when the
party who did the pinching happened to
have a bank account plain stealing in
other cases he laughed grimly

   go on please the young physician
spoke commandingly rather than plead-
ingly

  my but this seems to have made a hit
with you doctor phelan answered ban-
teringly well i need hardly say that
the lad has been the cause of no end of

trouble to his people his way of borrow-
ing what nobody lent him didnt break out
until about four years ago when he had
just entered college

  the matter was hushed up but the
faculty hinted to his people that it would
be well to take him away and get a private
tutor for him this was done but the
crook end of him stuck out all the same
whenever he could get his hooks on any-
thing portable there was something doing

  finally his fathers lawyers got busy
with the dry-goods and jewelry stores-
for it was these places that harold chiefly
fancied-and it was arranged that if he
were caught with the goods on the family
was to make good and mum was to be the
word the newspapers were also silenced
so too was our department its only when
a green cop or a new dry - goods sherlock
nabs the boy that lie is hauled ui is he
was to-day of course hes set tree as
soon as a motor-car can reach the station
house

   but havent they tried to treat him-
to cure him

  doc if we had one-twentieth of what
his people have spent on specialists sana-
toriums trips abroad and medical stunts
of all sorts and sizes wed own mansions
on easy street they have plenty of rea-
sons for wanting to cure the lad hes
the only son and his mothers health is
very poor his granddad and his dad so
they say had built their hope on harold
continuing the business and passing it on
to his son in turn he doesnt seem to
care to marry naturally he is shut out
of society for his people dont like the
idea of his partner at a dance or recep-
tion being shy a bracelet or a necklace
when the band stops

  dr jourdan was absently drumming his
fingers on the table plielan continued

  ive learned lately that they have de-
cided to put him away-not in an asylum
you understand-but some place where lie
cant get into trouble sorry i am too
for as ive said lies as lovable a lad as
youd ever meet with

  then youve met him have you

  manys the time that ive done that
said larry as he smiled when i was
 the street i knew his dad and old man
halliwell as well as i know you the
boy used to be around the offices a good
bit he had his fathers love for business
to see him sit there and talk voud never
dr jourdans mystery



believe hed bats in his belfry but they
had to keep their eye on him every moment
or hed be swipinghats and umbrellas or
pens or even ink-wells more than once
on the days that old nick was especially
strong in him i took him home at the re-
quest of his dad like all of his kind he
had his good and his bad days you know

  dr jourdan nodded

  yes recurrent periods are character-
istics of the malady 

  phelan nodded

   are you still in touch with the halli-
wells   asked the doctor

   yes and no was the answer  of
course they would remember me but thats
all ive learned doctor that rich people
aint likely to bear you in mind unless
they have use for you

chapter ii

against the lamp-post

hp he voice of mrs phelan was heard
summoning her husband to supper
the meal was served early because larry
had to report to his chief at six in the
evening

  well good day to you doc saicl the
detective as he arose to go  ill have to
bring you some of the coarse cut that the
chief smokes for your pipe has been going
out all the afternoon sure the fault must
be with the tobacco

  as the door closed behind him dr jour-
dan thrust his hands in his pockets and
strode up and down the den his lips pursed
as if he were about to -whistle this was
his habit when his mind was focused on
a subject of interest then he walked
from the den to the office and into the
front room

  through the lace curtains he surveyed
the crowd of people and vehicles that
swept through the street matinee day
and the fashionable theaters in the next
street were responsible for the line of
automobiles and carriages that lined the
sidewalks in front of his office special
policemen and the carriage-men of the
theater kept the vehicles moving in a slow
and steady fashion

  the performance was just over and
them was a flitting to and fro of pretty
and charmingly garbed girls and their com-
fortable-looking chaperons flunkies gor-
geous in silk smalls and plush coats

were moving hither and yon in dignified
haste the undercurrent of outsiders and
nobodies surged amid the main tide of
fashion

  right opposite the office leaning against
a lamp-post was a young man who eyed
the butterfly throng with the casual inter-
est of the city dvveller he didnt look ex-
actly  broke yet it was easy to see by
his dress and his linen that he wasnt
rampantly prosperous

  what attracted the doctors attention was
the expression on the young mans face
he looked tired out-not physically tired
but mentally as if hope had failed him
and he had thankfully accepted the numb
rest that failure brought

  youre a lucky beggar and you dont
know it said dr jourdan as he looked
 got to that stage when you are willing
to watch the procession go by and yet not
want to get into it lucky beggar i say
those of us who are eating our hearts out
because we see the parade and cant join
it would love to change places with you
no ill be hanged if i would this wait-
ing waiting is bad enough but it has a
promise in it for all that ill wait until
i see a break in the ranks thatll give me
my chance-if i have to wait until-

  at that moment some one tapped die
weary one on the shoulder he turned
and his broad grin made it evident that
the newcomer was welcome there was
an interchange of something green and
the pair strolled away in the direction of
a cafe

   if the helping hand doesnt turn up in
my case ill make my own hands help
me quoth dr jourdan smilingly then
his chin seemed to take on additional
aggressiveness he had hopes which he
intended to make realities

  a big man drove past wearing a tan-
clotli driving coat a broad-brimmed felt
hat his light road-wagon was spick and
span and the young horse hitched to it
was one of blood and spirit the doctor
who knew a good animal when he saw
one was admiring the set of its head the
play of the muscles beneath its satiny coat
and its fine ears and nostrils when an auto
on the opposite side of die street tooted
suddenly anch noisily

  at the sound the horse turned sharply
in toward the pavement locked the front
wheel on a lamp-post wrenched around
and in a flash upset the wagon throwing


the railroad mans magazine

the driver heavily on the asphalt of the
street

  as the animal reared the doctor with-
out waiting for further developments made
for the street shouting loudly to phelan
as he sped through the hall the detect-
ive answered the call in the manner of
a man accustomed to meet emergencies
both were by the side of the victim of the
accident before any of the other spectators
had their wits about them

  the man was lying on his face with his
arms stretched out in front of him a
little trickle of blood was beginning to steal
from under his forehead assisted by the
detective the doctor turned the injured one
over

  my god  cried phelan as he looked
 tis colonel nugent back you hose-
necks and give air back i say or
-

  thus he spoke to the curious crowd that
had gathered

   some of you look after the horse and
rig and if any of you take as much as a
hair from the blanket ill give you a free
trip up the river  larry flashed his shield
on the throng

   he always hated autos so he did and
now hes been killed by one of em con-
tinued larry to the doctor

   not quite that said the doctor coolly
as he made a cursory examination of the
wound but his condition is such that it
would be well if he were removed to his
home immediately where does he live

   somewhere down on long island

   that will never do we must take
him into the house phelan until we know
just how badly he is hurt

  at this moment the officer on post put
in an appearance phelan explained the
situation the colonel was carried into
the house placed in a spare room and dr
jourdan made careful diagnosis of his
hurt he had a bad scalp wound was
suffering from shock and there were pos-
sible internal injuries clearly he was in
no condition to be removed until develop-
ments one way or the other manifested
themselves

  so his friends were notified and also
his housekeeper-the colonel being a
bachelor arrangements were made at the
phelan home for his stay there until such
time as he could be safely taken elsewhere
dr jourdan was installed as his attend-
ant physician

  the texas constitution of the patient
vindicated itself there were no complica-
tions and he recovered rapidly he took
a great fancy to the young doctor and
when convalescence began the colonel de-
clared that he found his surroundings so
congenial that he really didnt want to
be removed to long island unless his stay
at the phelans was inconveniencing those
good people

  one day when the colonel was able to
sit up and read the wall street editions
of the afternoon papers dr jourdan made
his usual call the conversation drifted
into personal channels the bluff frank-
ness of the mining man invited confidence
almost before he knew it the physician
was telling the story of his professional
hopes and ambitions the majority of
which were centered around a theory of his
which he had subjected to partial tests

  you see colonel- he said there are
a good many mental states-perhaps i had
better call them maladies-that can be re-
ferred to causes of a purely physical -na-
ture for instance your liver is sluggish-
to use a lay term-or in other words it
fails to secrete to a sufficient quantity the
liquids that play an important part in the
process of digestion therefore your food
is not properly assimilated the system be-
comes charged with toxic matter and you
suffer from depression-the  blues  in
short

    in extreme cases of this sort there is a
tendency to suicidal mania in others we
have melancholia gloomy forebodings fear
of the future doubt of the present the
physical condition is reflected in mental
and moral conditions this is but one
instance in point

   the medical world is rapidly recogni-
zing the principle in question advanced
methods of treating the insane are for the
most part to the end of inducing that nor-
mal bodily condition that is invariably as-
sociated with a normal mentality un-
healthy body sheltering a healthy mind i
believe that nine-tenths of our criminals
are the victims not of kinks in their nor-
mal nature but of some unrecognized mal-
adies in their physical systems that if
eradicated would make them useful citi-
zens

  sounds good said the colonel but
it seems to me that there is a big  if 
tangled up in the proposition

    youre right and that is what im com-
dr jourdans mystery



ing to now i need not tell you tiiat the
germ theory of disease is accepted by med-
ical schools the world over it follows that
if ray theories just stated are correct men-
tal maladies-so called-may be cured by
the methods that are now used in the case
of physical maladies

    i dont quite get that  so-called  end
of the game- suggested the colonel

  for the reason given you-that all dis-
eases of brain or body can be referred to
something wrong with the latter so that
there are no mental troubles per se

  the colonel nodded understanding and
the doctor continued

  now nature has so ordered it that
practically every disease breeds its own
remedy thus from the blood of a pa-
tient suffering from diphtheria we can ob-
tain a serum that injected into the veins
of another person infected with the same
disease will palliate or cure the latter

    ordinary vaccination is a further illus-
tration of the great principle alluded to
the total trend of medical science is in
the direction of this prevention or cure
by means of inoculation and there is no
reason why mental or moral disorders of
all kinds should not be treated in the like
manner

   this is certainly a new one remarked
the colonel as he eyed the enthusiastic
face of the young man with attention not
unmixed with humor and if you put
it through a good many bug-houses will
sure go out of business

    yes and a whole lot of people now in
business will also put the shutters up
added the doctor

  meaning what

  my dear colonel said the medical
man  i know little about the street in a
practical way but if public opinion re-
garding it is to be accepted you have
among you a colony-perhaps i had better
say colonies-of those who are mentally
afflicted their predatory instinct is ab-
normally developed-diseased in fact if
they could be treated in the manner at
which i have hinted there would be a
good many offices to let in the financial
district for a restoration- to normality
would include the promptings of common
honesty what stands good of the street
is equally true of the business world at
large

  may be as you say admitted the
other  but i dont see how in thunder you

are going to test your theories or what
good it would do to put them to the test

    as to the latter retorted the doctor
i beg leave to differ with you if it were
possible to employ a remedy for dishonesty
in exactly the same way as we do for any
odier disease surely the world would be
better for our so doing the test of the
theory will in the first instance have to
be a matter of the consent on the part of
an individual or of that individuals
friends

   i believe that you have such an indi-
vidual in your minds eye declared the
colonel eying the doctor keenly you
talk as if you had diought about die whole
affair

  youre right replied dr jourdan
 i dont see a ghost of a chance of making
the test that i desire the person and the
persons people arent likely to lend them-
selves to the experiment

   and why 

   the doctor related the story of the halli-
well family skeleton as told him by phelan
adding that it was hardly likely that die
individuals mostly concerned would give
ear to an obscure physician when famous
specialists had failed to do aught for the
boy

  that depends  die credentials with
which the  obscure physician  approached
the family said the colonel somewhat
bluffly  but tell me how would you go
about the business  

  dr jourdan gave a rapid resume of his
ideas and plans he would prepare a
serum from the blood of some notorious
thief-preferably one who had been re-
peatedly arrested for his  specialty  this
serum he would inject into the tissues of
the patient having in mind his moral and
physical condition it would of course
be necessary to see that the crook who fur-
nished the vital fluid was in good health

  you talk as if you were mighty
familiar with this business queried the
colonel

  ive been working on the theory since
the day that i believed i knew something
about medicine said the doctor simply
 in germany i was privileged to study
under one of the most famous bacteriolo-
gists in italy likewise i took a course
in london to the same end in certain
hospitals in the west i experimented with
what i believe was approximate success

   evidently youre no theorist com-


the railroad mans magazine

merited the financier tell me is there
no possibility of harm coming to the pa-
tient 

    provided that proper precautions are
taken to insure the serum being prepared
from the blood of an absolutely healthy
person there would not be the slightest
chance that the patient would suffer from
the experiment

   the colonel reflected  i know george
h alii well quite well he said at length

 we have been in two or three deals to-
gether and things turned out exactly as
i told him they would hes got faith in
my business advice but i doubt if hed
accept my judgment when it came to an
affair like this

  the doctor caught the note of half-
promise in the speakers voice  then
colonel he said eagerly you believe in
what i have told you anyway

  my boy replied the mining man
the party who has lived in the west and
in wall street-and survived-can size up
his fellow humans ive sized you up and
your lode runs true-that is as far as your
beliefs are concerned whether you will
pan out when it comes to washing i cant
say not knowing enough of the medicine
vein but judging from what youve told
me i dont see why she shouldnt show
color-and good color at that

  thank you colonel the doctors
tone was eloquent of his feelings

   now went on the other ill tell
you what ill do ill give you a note of
introduction to halliwell that will any-
how insure your getting a friendly recep-
tion from him that which will follow
will rest with you personally of course
you chaps who work for professional glory
dont care a slag for the dollars but if you
should happen to make out all right with
harold youll have to buck-cinch your
bank-account lest she bust herself

chapter iii
in the halliwell home

in the matter of the introductory letter
the coloilel was as good as his word
having made a phone appointment with
mr halliwell the doctor called on that
gentleman one evening at his residence on
fifth avenue

   the wealth of the halliwells was made
manifest by the appointments of the man-

sion also by the gorgeously appareled
butler who opened the door to the visitor

  the head of the house received the phy-
sician with the cordiality that the colonel
had guaranteed and plunged into the sub-
ject of the call without muchparley he was
a small lean man with a keen kindly eye
a white mustache a thick crop of hair of
the same hue and a direct incisive meth-
od of speech that went to the conversational
core with a single thrust

  they talked for an hour or more mr
halliwell shooting question after question
at dr jourdan which showed that he
pretty well understood the doctors theories
and the medical principles on which they
were based nor was this to be wondered
at as the affliction of the son had been the
chief concern of his life for several years

  you are aware of course dr jour-
dan he said at length  that i have con-
sulted recognized authorities in regard to
harold and that these have failed to afford
the desired relief

   so i have been informed mr halli-
well replied the doctor

  and yet you believe you will succeed
where they have failed  

  there was a note of challenge in the
query

   i have faith in the teachings-the mod-
ern teachings-of medical science re-
plied the physician gently you must
remember sir that  am not voicing im-
personal or unsupported beliefs progress
in any science usually comes from quarters
in which attainment is desirable rather
than from those where attainment has been
achieved

  mr halliwell looked at the other with
renewed interest  in other words he
said  people with reputations are willing
to draw dividends on those reputations in-
stead of trying to increase their capital
doctor

  dr jourdan signified his acquiescence
by a gesture

  doctor i am going to ask you a ques-
tion to which i trust you will not take of-
fense said mr halliwell after a few mo-
ments of silence  you can i am sure
understand that where much is involved as
in this instance a close scrutiny of men
and motives is not only permissible but
necessary he paused for a reply

   i understand perfectly i shall be glad
to answer any question

  nugents letter as you know was
dr jourdans mystery



couched in terms that insured you this in-
terview if it had not been for that let-
ter i could hardly have received you in
view of the many attempts that are made
to waste my time on the score of my un-
fortunate son nevertheless i am inform-
ed that your acquaintance with him is of
a recent nature how i was so informed
does not matter for the present

  yes

    so that he really knows little of you
he is given to intuition so he claims
this with a smile  and usually his intui-
tions are to be relied on in this instance
they are decidedly in your favor but- for
all that his personal knowledge of you is
small-very small because of this i am
going to ask you is your alleged desire to
serve my son-and me-the outcome of
your natural wish to obtain professional
advertisement from so doing or for the
sake of the fee that will follow on my con-
sent or are you actuated by honest and
honorable motives  

  dr jourdan turned livid at the impli-
cation of the first part of the question
instantly however his good sense assert-
ed itself his sympathetic nature put him
in touch with mr halliwell as an afflicted
father and a rich man hounded and har-
assed by charlatans who preyed on his
parental affection for the sake of plunder

  he answered with a dignity that did not
escape the observent ken of the other

   i can give you documentary proofs
mr halliwell that the phase of my pro-
fession that i have had the privilege of
discussing with you to-night has engaged
my attention almost from the time that
i began my studies i have been obsessed
with the belief that medicine properly un-
derstood will not only cure the human
body but mans morality also if the lat-
ter happens to be diseased in time this
its nobler function will be made emphatic-
ally manifest

   it was this belief that prompted me
to seek an introduction to you for i felt
that if i could demonstrate the truth of my
theories through the medium of so prom-
inent a man as yourself the good to hu-
manity would be vast it is the privilege
of great wealth to set examples that may
be followed with benefit by those less for-
tunately placed as to any fee that might
accrue i pledge you my word of honor
that i never gave it the slightest considera-
tion are you answered

  the financier held out his hand which
the other took in silence  fully and sat-
isfactorily answered he said  but ive
been so badgered by cranks and quacks
and self-seeking members of your profes-
sion that i find it necessary to be brutally
frank-even where the credentials are of the
nugent order now-

       chapter iv
       enter miss mildred

hphere was a tap at the library door
followed by its opening there stood
a girl whose expression even more than her
beauty made dr jourdan stare in a way
that was by no means in accord with good
manners she was tall  imperially
molded as he told himself later and
held herself with a grace that was in en-
tire accord with the keynote of her love-
liness

  her face was a perfect oval her com-
plexion that of old ivory her eyes large
dark and having a virginal directness that
was delightfully embarrassing to any one
she looked at her mouth was small the
upper lip short and proudly tender the
nose straight and with finely curved nostrils

  but it was the soul behind the face that
held one there was the glory of high
hope in the things that were to be of the
possibilities that life held for her and hers
no wonder that the doctor caught his
breath and unmindful of all else looked
and looked until his good breeding assert-
ed itself and he very properly flushed for
shame at his awkwardness

  i beg pardon father said the girl
 but i thought you were alone the car-
riage is outside

  mr halliwell rose as the doctor had
already done this is dr jourdan mil-
dred he said

  miss halliwell inclined her head slight-
ly dr jourdans bow in response had
in it more of reverence than deference to
social usage

  well daughter asked mr halliwell
and what can i do for you

   i did not know that you were engaged
mother wishes me to remind you that it is
nearly eight oclock

  her voice was low and velvety and it
set the visitor to wishing that she would
talk some more by reason of the delight
that lav in listening to her

  j	 


the railroad mans magazine

  the financier glanced at his watch
tell her that ill be with her in a few
moments if you please he said rising

  the doctor rose also and being nearest
the door opened it for the young woman
she acknowledged the attention with an-
other inclination of her head while her
proud little mouth relaxed into the sem-
blance of a smile

  the doctor did not resume his seat in
spite of mr halliwells request that he do
so the girl had spoiled him for the eve-
ning he felt that he was out of touch
with his subject that any further attempt
to argue with the financier would prove
futile that he had temporarily lost his
power of concentration on the questions in-
volved in his professional beliefs

  while he felt angry with himself and
miss halliwell that this was so yet he
was compelled to admit the fact that the
experience bred within him an exhilara-
tion to which he had been a stranger dr
jourdan was not given to sentiment-
neither his temperament nor his professional
work being of a kind that made for its
growth

  yet in this instance and in the space
of a few minutes it seemed to him that
a flood of emotion had swept through
the dam of reserve that he had tried to rear
between him and the other sex even as
he knew this to be so he was conscious
of the utter folly of permitting himself
to even think of love in connection with
a girl who was to exchange her wealth and
beauty for a title

   since you insist then said mr hal-
liwell  i will leave you the truth is
we are going to the opera i had forgot-
ten the fact in the interest of our conver-
sation however we will meet again very
soon and have a further talk on the mat-
ter have you any engagements for fri-
day next

  the doctor consulted his engagement
book none that i cannot defer if you
so desire he replied

  mr halliwell thought for a moment
suppose you dine with me at the inter-
state club then on friday at 
oclock  

  the men parted

  dr jourdan as he journeyed down-town
was conscious of feelings that he did not
attempt to analyze but which he felt nev-
theless were due less to the professional

to be

  possibilities that lay before him than to
  his meeting with the girl being a young
  man of sound sense he did not allow him-
  self to indulge in profitless dreamings in-
  stead he accepted the inspiration that she
  had brought him and was content

    nevertheless this content did not per-
  mit of his thinking of her bartering her-
  self for a title without protest the
  psychology of the situation was involved
  on the one hand he felt that the girl was
  as near perfection as woman might hope
  to be on the other the idea that she was
  to marry  beneath  her-as he put it-
  did not lower her one whit in the ideal
  estimation in which he held her

    on his office desk he found a note from
  the colonel in which he expressed hope that
  the interview with mr halliwell had been
  satisfactory after reading it he went up-
  stairs to the convalescents room and found
  the colonel sitting near a window while
  the floor around was littered with evening
  newspapers

      hallo doctor  said the colonel ex-
  tending a welcoming hand  how goes
  it take a chair have a cigar theres
  tarantula extract and a siphon on the side-
  board

    dr jourdan told in close detail of his
  meeting with the financier the colonel
  listening intently slapped his knee enthu-
  siastically at certain phases of the recital

    youve got him doc youve got him
  sure  he roared when the physician came
  to the end of his tale  george halli-
  well isnt the man to want to set eves on
  you a second time unless hed a mighty
  good reason for doing so stick to him
  and hes vours did you see harold  
  no	v

    or any other members of die family
   miss halliwell was in the library for
  a few moments even as he spoke a
  slow flush crept over the doctors cheek
  much to his annoyance luckily it es-
  caped die notice of the colonel

    mildred is a pretty girl and sensible
  in most things said the colonel musingly
  flicking the ashes from his cigar with the
  tip of his little finger  mores the pity
  that she or her people are set on die fool
  idea of swapping their money and her good
  looks for a garlic-scented tide i guess
  tiiat her mother elegant woman though
  she is is the one whos at jhe bottom of
  this brainless business

new passenger engine recently constructed for the van dali a railroad

new locomotives of speed and
      ii- - power

                by john walters

the recent development in locomotive practise recorded from time to time
in the pages of the railroad mans magazine show a steady im-
provement in the building of the  iron horse  which must be evident
to all railroad men who place this marvelous creation above all other inven-
tions it must also disparage those who constantly prate that the locomotive
is doomed-that electricity has come to take its place but this article deals
with high speed in our locomotives and incidentally with the new mallet
engines that are being turned out by the american locomotive company

           -	r

the difference between locomotives that are specially constructed for
speed and those constructed to pull heavy loads
up heavy grades

eeping on the dot on a run-
ning schedule of  miles
an hour the fastest speed
average now maintained in
america may sound easy to
the ordinary individual who
reads only of startling record runs made
over particularly smooth and even stretches
of track but to men in the cab those figures
tell a different story

  an engineer knows that to keep up an
average of  miles an hour including
stops and slow downs necessitated by sta-
tions curves and grades means making

occasionally a good deal better time than a
mile a minute it requires a locomotive
that is as much ahead of the average hog
as a mallet outranks a switcher

 the standard -- atlantic and
-- pacific types are recognized by
american locomotive builders of to-day as
combining the greatest essentials of speed
power and reliability for the fastest
trains the atlantic type is a little more
favored than the pacific though there are
plenty of examples of the somewhat heav-
ier -- type in high-speed service

  taking as representative of these two




the railroad mans magazine

designs the pacific type locomotive that
makes our fastest speed average of 
miles an hour and the atlantic that comes
second on a run averaging  miles an
hour we find that the former has a some-
what greater total tractive effort and is used
on slightly heavier grades than its rival

                                         

details of construction

  both designs require a boiler - pressure
varying from  to  pounds per square
inch the boilers being exclusively of the
fire-tube type and generally with a round
top

  for steam distribution on high - speed
locomotives the stephenson link-motion is
largely used but of late years there has
been quite a tendency toward the wals-
chaert valve-gear recent reports from six
large railroad systems of the united states
show that the latter is more commonly
found on the -- type while the for-
mer is extensively used on the atlantic
locomotives

  in the opinion of some superintendents
of motive power the walschaert gear can
be commended solely from the standpoint
of easy inspection and maintenance but not
for superiority in steam distribution

  the argument is often advanced that as
fast locomotives must be run at varying
piston speeds constant-lead valve-gears are
not adapted to such service

  the shifting-link gear though having its
faults readily adapts itself to changing
piston-speeds and from the point of view
of steam distribution is far more of a suc-
cess as recent statistics show that sev-
enty-five per cent of the american high-
speed engines are fitted with the stephen-
son gear it would seem that in this class
of work it is not soon to be displaced

  super-heated steam has not yet become
common on our present-day speed-burners
while compounding is fast disappearing
there being a marked tendency toward the
simple-expansion engines in districts where
fuel is cheap oi when the added mainte-
nance cost offsets the gain in compounding

  fast trains in this country are ordinarily
composed of from six to eight cars and
taking the average at seven each with a
loaded weight of  tons the average
weight behind the locomotive is  tonsi

  the pacific type locomotive has a tender
capacity of  gallons more than the
atlantic and can handle a train over a
third heavier than its rival

  a study of prevailing conditions makes
it- appear that further developments in
high-speed locomotives are not to be looked
for by compounding more power could
be gained and better time perhaps made
but as compounding has not seen the same
success in this country that it has in eu-
rope owing to our dislike for over-compli-
cated mechanisms it is not apt to be tried
again moreover railroad officials in diis
country have found that the ordinary ex-
press trains earn more money in proportion
to their running expenses than the record-
breaking limiteds a feature that mitigates
considerably against faster schedules

types of european speed-burners

  the high-speed locomotives of europe
are about equally divided between the com-
pound and simple-expansion types of the
compounds the splendid work of the com-
plicated de glehn engines of france op-
erated on runs requiring an average speed
of sixty miles an hour easily places it in
the front rank of foreign locomotives

  england claims the longest no-stop run
in the world engines on the great west-
ern railroad from paddington to plymouth
travel  miles without a single let-up
the midland railway follows with a non-
stop run of  miles on these british
railroads as well as on the french lines
speeds as high as  miles are often made
on regular runs the usual arrangement
of the locomotive attaining high speeds
are the -- -- -- and --
types

  the two-cylinder type predominates in
england but few of these locomotives are
used in belgium germany and france
the four-cylinder engines are not all com-
new locomotives of speed and power



pounds many of them being simple-expansion
with two of the cylinders placed inside and two
outside of the frames

    there are no instances of the cylinders being
placed one over the other or one behind the
other and acting on the same cross-head as in
the vauclain or tandem types

    the average diameter of the driving-wheels
of these foreign locomotives is found to be about
 inches practically the same as that of the
driving-wheels used in america

    high boiler pressure is generally maintained
and the use of super-heaters in europe is becom-
ing popular though the majority of roads still
use wet steam

american articulated compound

    turning for a moment to the new articulated
compound the following description from the
bulletin no  published by the american
locomotive company will show the difference
between that companys locomotive-the ameri-
can articulated compound - and the mallet
the new american locomotive is an adaptation
of the principle of the mallet engine to ameri-
can railroad conditions the basic principle
is the same in both but the construction of the
mallet locomotive has been so modified in the
american articulated compound engine to meet
the requirements as to make it practically an
original design

   the mallet locomotive i understand was
first built in small designs its introduction
was due to the demand for a maximum power
within the limit of light rails and narrow-gage
track the introduction of the articulated
compound on the other hand was due to the
necessity of providing locomotives of greater
weight and power than could be obtained in
existing types- without exceeding the loading
limits of the rail and most of the examples of
this type in america are locomotives of enor-
mous weight and tractive power

   the only point in common which the ameri-
can has with the mallet is that it employs the
articulated principle and compounds the steam
in the system of compounding used in the
american-the distinctive feature of which is
the intercepting valve-is altogether different
from that employed on the mallet the sys-
tem of weight equalization differs in the two
types of engines as likewise the construction
of the flexible steam-pipe joints

     an articulated compound locomotive is one
having two sets of cylinders compounded to-
gether and driving independent groups of
wheels says the american locomotive com-

new -- locomotive built for the chicago and alton for heavy freight service


the railroad mans magazine

panys bulletin the two sets of cylin-
ders are supplied with steam from a single
boiler it is practically two locomotives
combined in one and having one boiler
the rear group of wheels is carried in
frames rigidly attached to the boiler in the
usual manner while the frames which
carry the front group of wheels are not
secured to the boiler but support it by
means of sliding bearings

  there is a hinged connection between
the frames of the front engine and those
of the rear engine about which the former
is permitted a limited swing in relation to
the latter it will be seen that the front
group is a truck which swivels radially
about its articulated connection with the
rear group when the locomotive passes
through a curve it is from this feature
that the articulated type of locomotive de-
rives its name

   because of the fact that only the rear
group of wheels is carried in rigid frames
the articulated type of locomotive provides
a short rigid wheel-base capable of passing
through curves of short radius at the
same time the total number of wheels is
greater than in the ordinary types of loco-
motives and in weight is distributed over
a greater number of axles

   consequently tractive power may be
provided in this type without an excessive
weight per wheel on the rail in an articu-
lated compound locomotive having twice as
many driving-wheels as a given locomotive
of the rigid-frame type double the tractive
power of the latter is available with the
same weight per driving-wheel on the rail
and with no increase in the length of the
rigid wheel - base or vice versa with the
same tractive power in each case the weight
per driving-wheel on the rail of the articu-
lated compound locomotive may by the
use of the proper wheel arrangement be
released to one-half of that of a given loco-
motive of any of the types in ordinary use

  the work being divided between two
sets of pistons crank - pins rods and
driving-axles an enormous tractive power
is obtained in the articulated compound
locomotive with practically no increase in
the weights of the moving parts over those
of a locomotive of the rigid - frame type
having half the tractive power or with
the same tractive power in each case the
moving parts of the articulated locomotive
may be made much lighter than those of
locomotives of other types

   in addition to the advantages due to its
wheel arrangement the articulated com-
pound locomotive possesses all those result-
ing from compounding the steam this
type of compound locomotive is what is
known as a two-stage compound that is
the steam is used successively in two sets
of cylinders steam from the boiler is ad-
mitted to the first set or high-pressure cyl-
inders which ordinarily drive the rear
group of wheels and having done work in
those cylinders is then used over again in
the second set or low - pressure cylinders
which are connected to the front group of
wheels from the low-pressure cylinders
the steam is exhausted to the atmosphere

   between the high and low pressure cyl-
inders and connecting the two is a large
pipe called the receiver into which the
steam from the high-pressure cylinders ex-
hausts when the locomotive is working
compound the receiver is simply a reser-
voir in which the exhaust steam from the
high-pressure cylinders is stored until it
is required by the low-pressure cylinders
from the receiver the steam is admitted
into the low-pressure cylinders by their
valves in the usual manner

   the low - pressure cylinders have a
larger piston area than the high-pressure
cylinders the ratios between the two being
such that at the ordinary working cut-off
the steam at the lower pressure per square
inch acting against the larger piston area
exerts the same force as the higher pressure
steam acting on the -smaller area conse-
quently the high and low pressure cylin-
ders having the same stroke each set of
cylinders ordinarily does practically the
same amount of work

six or seven expansions

  by using the steam successively in two
sets of cylinders a greater range of ex-
pansion is obtained than in a simple or
single expansion locomotive in other
words the difference between the pressure
of the steam entering the high-pressure cyl-
inders and the pressure it has when the
exhaust from the low-pressure cylinders
opens is greater than in the case of a sim-
ple locomotive

   in a simple locomotive the steam is
ordinarily expanded only four times while
in a two-stage compound six or seven ex-
pansions are obtained as a result more
work is performed by the same amount of
new locomotives of speed and power



steam in a compound than in a simple loco-
motive and a considerable saving in coal
and water consumption is thereby effected

   moreover compounding divides the
range of temperature between the two sets
of cylinders so that the condensation in
the cylinders is reduced which effects a

made by which in cases of emergency when
additional hauling capacity is required the
locomotive may be changed from working
compound into simple with an increase in
power

 in the american articulated compound
locomotive these functions are performed

further saving in fuel and water consump-
tion

   in every compound locomotive some
provision must be made for admitting
steam direct from the boiler to the low-
pressure cylinders in starting and until
the exhaust from the high-pressure cylin-
ders supplies the low-pressure cylinders
with steam also provision is usually

by a special mechanism called the inter-
cepting valve which is located between the
receiver and the exhaust passages from the
high-pressure cylinders

  another device used by other locomo-
tive builders in place of the intercepting
valve employed by the american locomo-
tive company is an arrangement by which
on opening a valve operated from the cab


the railroad mans magazine

communication sis established between the
two ends of the high - pressure cylinder
through a by-pass pipe and live steam re-
duced in pressure by passing through this
pipe is admitted to the receiver and so to
the low-pressure cylinders

  with the by-pass arrangement when
the locomotive is working simple live steam
is necessarily admitted to both sides of
the high - pressure pistons consequently
these pistons are very nearly balanced at
the same time the live steam which is ad-
mitted to the low-pressure cylinders is re-
duced in pressure the result is that un-
der these conditions when the locomotive is
starting or working simple all of the work
is done by the low-pressure cylinders and
little increase in power is secured

   in the american locomotive com-
panys system of compounding the inter-
cepting valve is so designed that when the
engine is working simple the exhaust from

the high - pressure cylinder passe directly
to die atmosphere and the valve cuts off
communication between the receiver and the
exhaust side of the high-pressure pistons
thus relieving diem of back pressure except
that of the steam exhausting

   moreover the live steam from the boiler
reduced to a pressure of somewhat above
the ordinary pressure in the receiver is ad-
mitted to the low-pressure cylinder hence
the low-pressure pistons are exerting more
power than when working compound this
additional power added to that secured in
the high-pressure cylinders gives a total in-
crease in power when working simple of
about  per cent

   the intercepting valve also automatical-
ly regulates the pressure of the live steam
entering thefeceiver when starting and when
working simple keeping it at such a pres-
sure that each of the four cylinders does
practically the same amount of work

                   the mystery of a money-order for
                    is solved after many years

he garrulous man in the cor-
ner of the smoking compart-
ment kept up his incessant
uninteresting chatter the
porter was making up the
berths whenever his swarthy
head appeared at the entrance and nodded
to one of the unwilling listeners that man
promptly retired thus the audience dwin-
dled to but one man who remained so
stubbornly silent and heedless of all re-
marks directed at him that conversation
soon waned

  the conductor entered taking a seat
he began to arrange ids- tickets it was
a heavy run and this was his only op-
portunity to get a line on his cargo

  the talking-machine watched him a mo-
ment evidently somewhat impressed with
the dexterity with which he handled the
pasteboards and then blurted out

   been with the road long  

  twenty-two years replied the con-
ductor

   ever been in a wreck  

  the conductor pausing in his count
made a pencil notation on a slip of paper

  yes several he responded pleasantly
for he was a patient man then he re-
sumed his task

	r r	

companys busi-
iurment after a

  ever been hurt

 intent upon his work te conductor pre-
 tended not to hear but the relief was only
 temporary

keeping tab on the
ness eh   persisted the
moment of silence

  yes to some extent

  got things pretty well systematized i
 see they dont give you a chance to get
 away with anything

as this did net seem to demand an an-
swer none was given

  it was different in the old days wasnt
 it

  yes very much

yes i know a man who was a con-
ductor about twenty years ago he has
not done any work for ten years and seems
to be very well fixed he says that in his
day it was easy to make double salary and
that the company didnt kick if the men
didnt dig any deeper than that is that
a fact

the conductor had finished but had no
inclination to continue the discussion

  i dont know sir he said as he rose
  in all my experience i never turned in
 but one false report that one was enough
 for me


the railroad maxs magazine

  he left immediately and did not return
until he had made the round of the train
the voluble passenger was then peacefully
snoring in his berth but the silent man
remained quietly smoking

  have you a few minutes leisure he
asked as the conductor entered

  yes sir

  well take a seat and a cigar and bear
with me as patiently as you can

  the conductor accepted and made him-
self comfortable

    i couldnt help hearing what that idiot
had to say to you which didnt amount
to much except that it was tiresome but
your remark when you left interested me
very much would you mind telling me
about it

  what do you mean the short re-
port

  yes

  oh that was a long time ago id
rather forget it

  thats all right pardon me you
know i dont mean to be impudent

  the conductor gazed thoughtfully out
into the darkness

  you know he said at length it was
an odd impulse that prompted the remark
in the first place i wondered at it and
was thinking about it when you asked me
i dont object to telling you though i dont
know if it will interest you very much it
was on the old c and g

  you dont say so in tom byrnes
time  

  yes he was the big chief then did
you know him  

  not so well as i did later though i
wfas with him a great deal during the old
c and g days

  well in that ca-e you know one of
the biggest and best men who ever lived
and-

   yes i come to feel that more and
more now that hes gone

  that waswhat i was trying to say i
dont believe there was a detail of the roads
affairs that he did not look into person-
ally and get tothe very core i remember
once after switching in the yards a few
months i got a freight run twisting
brakes was no snajs in the days before they
put on air

   i was a mere kid in the service byrne
had some business up the road and as
there was no passenger out at night he
took our train he was in the caboose when

i came in and as soon as i got within
range of the one dingy hnging-lamp in
the car he said c hallo sparks how do
you like your new run 

    i thought of course that the conductor
had told him he had a green hand aboard
but later he said he hadnt it was just
byrnes way

  your name is sparks

  yes why

  oh nothing i remember some of the
old c and g men and a mention of
byrne calls up so many memories it takes
some time to straighten them all out

   yes thinking about him makes me lose
track of my story before long i was trans-
ferred to no  that was a combina-
tion passenger and freight that ran to mell-
worth every morning and back at night
it carried five or six cars a combination
baggage and smoker and one dingy coach
but it did a good business for it stopped
everywhere i have seen it fill and empty
itself three times on the trip

-	 it was a most accommodating accom-
modation i remember one family that
lived half-way between stations some
member of it was going to town or coming
out nearly every day and we stopped even-
time we saw a handkerchief or white rag
hanging on the gate-post

   by and by we saved them a great deal
of trouble by letting them change the signal
so that they hung it out only as a warning
for us not to stop maybe you think im
joking but its a fact on such a run of
course a good part of the fares and freight
charges were paid in cash

  no is was the same kind of a train
only it arrived in the morning and went
out in the afternoon we passed it at
rutler on both trips gresham was con-
ductor of no  and thompson had
charge of no  while joe brown some-
times substituted for both of them

  joes brother fred braked tor
thompson and i was with gresham blit
as all of the men lived in town we switched
about a good deal to give the s crew a
chance to spend more time at home

   gresham and thompson were both old-
timers and stood so well with the main
office that i used to wonder why younger
fellows were passed right along to some of
the best runs on the road but none of our
crew ever complained

  well one day gresham was sick and
the- sent for joe brown fred appeared


not on the books



 in his stead and explained that he had
 induced joe to work for him for a couple
 of days he seemed to take it for granted
 that he would be just the man to fill the
 place and with an air of importance went
 to the telephone

     i heard him call the main office and
  could tell that byrne was at the other end
  he explained the situation glibly when it
  was evident that he was interrupted by the
  sudden manner in which he called me to
  the phone byrne was brief and to the
  point

    sparks he said you take out that
 train and bring it back and if you put
 it through all right ill try to give you a
 regular one before long

     i felt sorry for fred his countenance
  dropped when i told him but there was no
  help for it at the depot a messenger
  brought me die old leather pocketbook full
  of slips which gresham took out every
  morning and turned in every night fred
  eyed me enviously as i tucked it away

     at the first stop we took on an old
 friend of gresham who had made the trip
 a hundred times i had noticed that
 on former occasions he  always handed
 gresham a xoin and got back change he
 was reading a paper when i came through
 and without looking up he handed me a
 half-dollar

       its fifty-five cents to wares station
  i said holding out my hand for another
  nickel

     he looked up in a kind of daze but
 seeing a strange face under the cap mut-
 tered something and hurriedly produced the
 money later i saw fred stop and talk
 to him he looked at me and nodded his
 head wisely

     fred seemed eager to help-more so
 than i had ever seen him he was the first
 man off at every station and willingly
 helped in handling and checking up the
 lighter freight as i was new to the work
 and got confused at times i was thankful
 for his help and thought i had made a
 mistake when i counted eleven barrels
 rolled off at rislings when his report and
 return in cash was for eight

    he greeted every passenger especially
  the regulars and once as one of them was
  climbing up the platform steps he leaned
  over and whispered something the man
  hesitated and then turned around and
  dropped off just as the train started

l these things impressed me as slightly

queer but the real surprise awaited me at
rutler thompsons jaw dropped when he
saw me in charge he called joe brown
and after a hurried consultation they
walked over to me with the evident inten-
tion of being very friendly thompson
announced that he would take fred back
with him and that joe would go along and
help me out

  now this somewhat reversed things
for i had often made the trip with joe
in charge but he was graciousness itself
and did not seem to resent being for die
time subordinate to a youngster he soon
tipped his hand however when slapping
me on the back he said  well old man
youd better let me take the book ill look
out for it and you can sign the report
no i said  byrne told me to take
it out and bring it back and im here to
obey orders

    oh all right he replied snappishly

 i only wanted to help

    i felt mean about this but did not see
how i could do anything else we didnt
refer to the matter again till we unloaded
and pulled onto the siding at mellworth

    then he insisted that i go over to ho-
gartys for a glass of beer i laid the book
 the table as we sat down he took it
up and looked it all over carefully then
he sized me up for a full minute

    now see here george he said

 theres no use beating about the bush
you simply cant let this go in this- way
it would be a dead give-away for all of
us you ought to know that gresham and
thompson have been making a good thing
out of this run for a long time when i
first subbed for them i got wise and
dropped into line

     you dont want to hurt them but if
you turn in this report its discharge for
them and for me too theyre pretty pop-
ular fellows and have friends thatll make
it hot for you if anything happens

   i told him i didnt see how i could
help but he kept on arguing and threaten-
ing until i left him to get my dinner
about half past twelve i saw him enter
the local telegraph office and knew of
course that it was to get word to thomp-
son who would soon pass it on to his friend
gresham

  that trip back was a torture i kept
the strictest tab on everything while brown
sulked and pouted on the platform at
rutler he and thompson came to me


the railroad mans magazine

they kept me busy during die whole stop
arguing over the matter brown angry and
vehement thompson calm persuasive but
no less earnest

     well what about it  they demanded
after eight minutes wrangling

   i shook my head

    boys i said  i am sorry but i
didnt start this game and i wont have
anything to do with it im sorry but i
cant help you

  with that i left them muttering bit-
terly under his breath brown followed me
to the train i got a peep at thompson as
we pulled out but from the expression of
his face you could not have guessed that
anything unusual was in the air after
his first surprise in the morning he seemed
prepared for anything and never lost his
temper

   as soon as we got under way desiring
to be alone i went into the baggage-car
then it was my turn to be surprised
propped up in a chair pale and agitated
was gresham sick as he was thompson
had got him out and brought him up on
 he was a pitiable object

   he recognized me and tried to smile
it made my heart ache to see him

    george he said and his voice was
weak and husky  havent i always treated
you right 

   i certainly had to admit that he had
for he was a considerate man to work un-
der and i always liked him

    well george he went on as soon as
he had strength  you have it in your power
to ruin me i am sick-really sick-and
though i cant deny that i have made pretty
free with the companys money it has
done me very little good

    there is very little of it left and
more than once i have regretted that i
ever fell into the habit now if youll
stand by us this time ill see that thomp-
son and i let up youll be doing a favor
to the company as well as us

  well i hate to go over it all i
wouldnt give in so long as they had threat-
ened and blustered but when this sick man

whom i had known and liked for years
sat there begging me not to ruin him-well
i couldnt stand the combination i weak-
ened and called brown

   we made out a new trip-sheet repre-
senting about one-half of the actual cash
business i signed this and turned it in
then i went up to byrnes office and asked
him to put brown on the run

  why dont you like the work he
asked

   i told him i did but that the respon-
sibility was heavy and i was afraid of
losing my head and getting things badly
mixed

   he smiled rather strangely and said he
would humor me i never understood why
a month later he gave me one of the best
runs on the road

   maybe i can tell you replied the pas-
senger whose interest had increased as the
narrative progressed  what did you do
with the rake-off

   oh why-that doesnt matter

  how much was it

   twenty-eight dollars and seventy-five
cents

  well maybe i can tell you what be-
came of it

  it was the conductors turn to be curious

  yes i was byrnes-secretary at the
time he knew gresham and thompson
were holding out but said that their suc-
cessors would do the same as they were
good trainmen he let them stay he said
it was the fault of the system so gradually
he changed the system

   i dont remember your report but i do
remember a money-order for twenty-eight
dollars and seventy-five cents purporting to
have been sent by one wesley james for
freight charges of which we could find no
record

   the old man puzzled over it for sev-
eral hours a few days later he said to
me  well ive found out about it sparks
is a good fellow and didnt want to give
his friends away so he made his report in-
instalments put him on the preferred list
for promotion

that so and which direction is it goin to

the engineer thinking to have a little fun with
the old fellow by getting him into an argument

 famous freak railroads

by jack silverton

that peculiar trait of humanity which prompts one to do something out
of the ordinary lies at the bottom of most of the improvements that
have been made in the material things of life at the same time it is
responsible for many queer and freakish inventions-some of which have been
so ludicrous as to make one marvel that a dollar could be raised to exploit
them as a rule the more important an invention or device the more it is made
a target for cranks the railroad furnishes a number of illustrations of this
statement no other creation perhaps has been beset with so many queer and
unworkable ideas

queer railroad conceptions that baffled common sense and dissipated
fortunes and others that worked smoothly and made
money for their owners

  horse-power of the locomotive or motor can
  be greatly reduced that the speed can be
  increased it is said that the germans in-
  tend using the device for conveying ammu-
  nition and supplies to the front in case
  of war

    some years ago a genius in south da-
  kota gave to a wondering world what he
  called the gravity-flume railroad here
  again it was a case of a prophet or rather
  an inventor not having honor in his own
  country the inventor after trying to in-
  terest his countrymen went to england
  where he managed to get a working model
  built after that there is silence

     the gravity-flume line was built on a se-
  ries of pillars that were moved up and
  down by steam power as they so moved
  they elevated or depressed the track in ac-
  cordance with the position of the train

     the main idea of the device was to al-
  ways have the track behind the cars rising
  upward by means of the pillars so that the
  former were sent forward by gravity inas-
  much as they were perpetually running
  down-hill

     after the cars had passed a given point
the track by an operation of the pillars


 german government in
 purchased of a new
york professor albert c al-
bertson the world patents of
a magneto-railway pro-
fessor albertson was also
required to give bonds that he would not
invent or attempt to invent anything that
infringed on the main principle of the rail-
way this principle was a curious one
the track is somewhat elevated from the
coaches and motor arms of wood and metal
descend and curve under the rails the
lower parts of these arms are faced with
electromagnets that turn upward toward the
under sides of the rails

    these magnets can be charged either from
 a small dynamo carried on the train or
 from the driving current itself if an elec-
 tro-motor is used now when the magnets
 -are in action they naturally pull upward to
 the rails at the same time lifting the cars
 with them by regulating the pull of the
 magnets in accordance with the load car-
 ried the weight of the cars can be reduced
 to a minimum

 this means that there is a nominal wear
 and tear on the right-of-way that the


the railroad mans magazine

became motionless again until the coming
of the next train the pillar mostly con-
cerned for the moment was set in motion
by a device actuated by the train itself

  but this was by no means all the track
was flume-shaped and made of sheet-iron
so riveted that it was flexible to a certain
degree

  the cars were without wheels and had
flat bottoms that fitted into the flume a
shallow current of water ran through the
flume at irregular intervals on which the
cars floated given the water and the
moving pillars the cars shot ahead smooth-
ly and swiftly-in theory at least but
alas after the building of the model noth-
ing more seems to have been heard of the
invention

  a freak railroad of a totally different
type is owned by perceval heywood a
wealthy englishman the line runs
through his estate at duffield hall south
derbyshire it is about a mile long and
includes every kind of difficulty or problem
that a railroad engineer is called upon to
face such difficulties are of course made
to order and they are in miniature also
but they are none the less faithful to the
facts for all that

  there are curves in plenty embankments
cuttings bridges a viaduct twenty-five feet
in height a tunnel hewn out of the solid
rock points crossings clear stretches and
many tiny stations the gage of the road
is fifteen inches mr heywood runs the
road for fun

lilliputian roads

  there is a real carrying line in east
frisia germany which is five miles long
two and a half feet in breadth and has a
weekly pay-roll of about  the roll-
ing-stock consists of two engines three
coaches four trucks and two vans the
staff all told is made up of one driver one
fireman one guard and one plate-layer
the engines weigh seven tons each seven
cents is the fare for a ride from one end of
the road to the other there is passenger
and produce traffic and the financial con-
dition of the line is said to be satisfactory

   still another lilliputian railroad is the
terraced line that runs between bala and
festiniog wales it has a gage of one
foot eleven and one-half inches covers about
two miles and does a paying passenger
business

  the railroad that exists within the
boundaries of woolwich arsenal england
furnishes a curious example of the con-
servative nature of the british it is nine-
teen miles long and fills an important place
in the economy of the great establishment
but the driver and the fireman of every
engine still have to alight to set the points
and sometimes to apply the breaks it was
so in the old times and none of the officials
seem to have thought it advisable to bring
about a change of methods

coney islands bicycle road

  probably one of the freak roads best
known to the public is the bicycle railroad
by reason of its having been seen in action
in two or three places in this country it
was not so long ago that the last remnants
of the boynton bicycle railroad were re-
moved from the stretch of land that lies
between the western part of gravesend and
coney island the invention was precisely
what its name implied a locomotive and
cars fitted with wheels a la bicycle

   the length of the coney island road was
over a mile and on one occasion the writer
with some friends covered the distance in
what was alleged to be half a minute but
the idea didnt seem to strike the traveling
public or the angels and  it flickered
out the gyroscope-train it is true runs
on a monorail but its underlying principle
is vastly different to that of the boynton
invention

   people in search of thrills can be accom-
modated by several roads now running
take the pikes peak line for example
the engine and car with the assistance of
a cog-wheel arrangement crawl up the side
of the mountain that assumes a shivery an-
gle in a good many places there is abso-
lutely no danger however and the ride is
wonderful

   on the other side of the atlantic these
thrillers are pretty numerous the line over
mont cenis includes a good many startling
inclines the lickey incline on the bir-
mingham and gloucester branch of the
midland railway is the steepest in eng-
land with one exception the guide-books
describe it as  safe but nerve-trying

  mont pilatus near lucerne switzer-
land is ascended by a road that is about as
steep as can be well imagined here again
the cog-wheel principle has made good
much to the comfort of thousands of tour-
famous freak railroads



ists that prefer to do their mountaineering
in a comfortable car

  but for real sensation the line up the
side of vesuvius is unapproachable it is
decidedly steep in the first place and the
region through which it passes suggests that
you are running over the top of an uneasy
and boiling caldron there is steam and
sulfurous odors and very likely sounds of
a disturbing sort in certain parts of the
line a thick wall has been built  to protect
the tourists from sudden advents of lava
as the guide-books have it

  last of all where the road ends abruptly
there are pillars of smoke perhaps tongues
of flame and subterranean mutterings and
grumblings what more could die sensa-
tion-loving visitor desire

this is the shortest road

  the late sir george newnes the pub-
lisher was the proprietor of the steepest
and shortest road in the world it connects
lynton and lynmouth devonshire eng-
land and cuts through a cliff for the great-
er part of length which is only nine hun-
dred feet the rails which are bolted into
the solid rock have an incline of one foot
in one three-quarter feet the cog-wheel
system is used in connection with its oper-
ation

  in west somerset england about twelve
miles back from the sea is a range of high
land known as the brendon hills just
fifty years ago rich iron ore was discovered
on the tops of these hills and a line was
constructed from their base to the little port
of watchet for the purpose of conveying the
ore to small schooners and thence to car-
diff wales there to be smelted

  from the foot to the top of the hills an
incline about a mile-in length was con-
structed that in point of length and steep-
ness was a rival to the lickey incline flat
cars were drawn up the slope by a steel
rope and it was considered a fairly plucky
feat to squat in the bottom of one of these
cars and be speeded to the top

  one day it was discovered that the same
kind of ore could be bought much cheaper
in spain so the mines and the line were
abandoned so too was the village of
brendon near the mines and one or two
hamlets at the foot of the hill to-day
the right-of-way is rusting and the rolling-
stock has either been removed or is lying
around the sport of the elements

  fifty years ago the great southern and
western railroad of ireland undertook to
operate a road from birr to parsonstown
part of the needed funds were supplied by
the parent road part by local subscribers
and still another portion by the parsonstown
board of works the new line was a fail-
ure and when the lease of the g s and
w expired in  it was not renewed

  the board of works then stepped in with
claims against the property so did the
local tax-gatherers so did some of the pri-
vate subscribers a legal tangle ensued
and nobody seemed to quite know to whom
the remnants of the road belonged the
population roundabout realized the situa-
tion and began to make the best of it

  a system of plunder was begun and so
thoroughly carried out that by the year s
practically nothing of the road remained
except its memory

  everybody who lived in the neighborhood
appears to have taken a hand in assisting
the road to disappear points signals rails
signal-cabins turn-tables gates bridges
station buildings sleepers in fact every-
thing vanished

the after-dinner  limited

  there is a road that is given to con-
viviality it is known as the wine and
cigars transportation service and was
built for its present owner by the firm of
w g armstrong whitworth  co

  the line is sixty-six inches in length or
rather oval it has an engine tender and
four coaches the first of these is a correct
model of the locomotives used by the great
western railroad of england it is made
of silver-plated sheet brass

  the coaches are of wood with brass
mounting and the wheels and axles of
brass the track has silver-plated rails
resting on mahogany sleepers the rails
fish-plates etc are accurate models of the
real things the gage is three and one-
half inches the right-of-way can be laid
in fifteen minutes the train can cover the
full distance in a few seconds

  this interesting little road is used on the
dining table of the owner when the time
comes for coffee and cigars the last
coach which is open at the top is loaded
with fifty cigars the other three carry
each a cut-glass decanter the train is
operated by an electric current that is con-
trolled by a switch handled by the host
blanchard the boomer

by h m lome

            the camera may not have unlocked
            the trouble but it got all the blame

ben blanchard was
a small chubby man with
baby-stare eyes and an in-
fantile smile he called
himself a community-pro-
moter this as must be
admitted was a more taking title than that
of land-boomer especially when much of
the land so boomed was productive of little
else than sand - burrs sage-brush cacti
jack-rabbits and a fair sprinkling of
rattlesnakes

  that is by the way however if you
make inquiries among his eastern friends
-especially in montague street brooklyn
--you will gather some picturesque esti-
mates of mr blanchards business abili-
ties financial persons of brooklyn pride
themselves -on being possessed of a certain
yankee shrewdness which steers them clear
of the wiles of the average schemer

  apart from that no man is considered
reliable until he has been properly intro-
duced by an old brooklynite this once
done he is established in their confidence

  now ben blanchard managed to make
his entry into montague street under the
auspices of a certain brooklynite of ancient
and honorable lineage through the in-
troduction thus afforded him the commu-
nity-promoter made a number of acquaint-
ances of a highly beneficial sort

  among the communities which blanchard
had brought into being were a couple in
western kansas at various points farther
west he was in touch with other promoters
to whom he introduced  good things  from
the east receiving in return a percentage
of the ensuing plunder

  once a year he was accustomed to issue
invitations for a western trip to a dozen
or twenty of the rich and easy people

whom he met in the east the junket was
done in fine style a special car with at-
tendants was provided the food was excel-
lent at topeka and the stopping-places
beyond the local boards of trade did honor
to the distinguished visitors and so did
the local newspapers to the extent of many
columns

  during the very last trip engineered by
blanchard i acted as historian-to use
the blanchardian term in reality i was his
press-agent thus it was that he happened
to have a certain experience with railroad
superstition

  the party after visiting denver and
manitou was on its way east at pueblo
one afternoon there was a change of en-
gines and as it subsequently turned out
the engineer had orders to let her lick
across the prairie so as to show the eastern
gentry that there was nothing slow about
that particular section

  an old-time dobe house not far from the
depot had excited the interest of some of
the party and while awaiting their return
the writer walked up the platform carrying
a kodak of goodly proportions jim dell
the engineer-tall lank and sunburnt to
the hue of an indian with oil-can in hand
-was just getting into the cab his fire-
man followed wiping his fingers in a clout
of greasy  waste the camera was made
ready for action

  dell wheeled sharply as the bellows-
catch of the camera clicked then he
frowned at the instrument and its owner

  youre sure thinkin of gettin a picture
of this here machine  

  i said that was my plan

   and of me and my pardner  

  i nodded

  well im saying this i am the ma-
blanchard the boomer



chine cant get away from you i spose
but ill be durned if you get my face or
bills inside that contraption why for
reasons-good reasons ive never had my
picture took yet by one of them black boxes
that was owned by a passenger but what
trouble of several sorts followed aint that
the truth bill

  bill grunted assent

  then the pair clambered hastily into the
cab and even as they did so the bulb was
pressed and a good negative of two greasy
rear-fagades was secured

  dell followed instructions in the matter
of speed as a roaring swirling wake of
dust and dried cactus attested but the
going was too good to last

  whether the hoodoo in the  black box 
bestirred itself or whether bill got too busy
with the fire-shovel the narrator knoweth
not the fact remains however that less
than fifty miles from the starting-point the
engine and the car came to a jagged halt

  as the camera registered a record of the
wreck jim and his helper cursed eastern

dudes whose hoodoos worked mischief with
western locomotives

  it was three hours before pueblo fur-
nished another engine that even to the lay
eye looked grouchy and superannuated

   its that confounded old highbinder
no  jim was heard to mutter as the
fresh engine wheezed into sight over a roll
of the prairie  hear the durned bron-i-cal
lungs of her

  anyhow no  was coupled up and jim
and his helper proceeded to throw it into
her for all that they were worth and a trifle
more than she was thirty miles had not
been covered when the car seemed to turn
itself into an aeroplane for a sickening sec-
ond or so came back down on the rails with
a spine-jarring thud and then stopped with
a suddenness that threw people and things
in unstudied heaps throughout its length
luckily the camera was unhurt

  naturally everybody made for the doors
a few left by the windows the cause of
the unscheduled stop was plain no  had
snapped her driving-rod near the middle

ill be durned if you get my face or bills inside that contraption


the railroad mans magazine

and it had smashed the cab to fragments
bill and jim had apparently vanished into
thin air the wreck was striking and even
picturesque so the camera was made ready

  then we were all made conscious of
a gaunt black and blood-covered appari-
tion arising from a near-by clump of sage-
brush swearing horribly and picking burrs
from out its cheeks and hands it was jim
disguised in his gore and the grime of the
accident he lifted up his voice and yelled

  what did i tell you about that black
box i tell ye all went on jim address-
ing the tourists collectively in a roar  if

jolery and entreaty before jim gave consent
for the camera to travel behind him and
when heleft us at south hutchinson kan-
sas he wore an evident look of relief

  but that was not the whole or the end
of the hoodoo on the way to kansas city
one of the party let a valuable gold watch
slide out of an open window at st louis
it was discovered that a flange of the car-
wheel had suddenly worn as thin as card-
board and that a bad accident had been
narrowly averted

  before this when on the home-stretch
between buffalo and new york blanchard

arose and addressing the party expressed
his gratification at meeting so many men of
congenial disposition and sterling worth
and in order to commemorate the occasion
he was going to do his good his ever dear
friends a small service etc etc he was
going to let them in on a little deal which
he had intended to keep all to himself but
which on second thoughts he had deter-
mined to share with those whose friendship
he had learned to etc etc every man bit

  six months later i met a member of the
party on broadway

   say said he  have you still got that
camera of yours  

 yes why

   oh nothing but i begin to believe in
jim and his superstitions maybe if the
camera hadnt brought bad luck on board
myself and the other idiots wouldnt have
lost large sums to blanchard

what did i tell
you about that
black box 

that there box has a berth on the car agin

i	dont drive no engine in front of it
you hear him snortingly supplement-
ed bill who now appeared from the other
side of the engine he had evidently fallen
face downward into a clump of cacti and
the spines in his nose and lips made him
speak snuffingly

  and added bill shooting a malevo-
lent glance at the camera-owner  if i had
my way thered lie a certain fool party left
behind on the prairie in company with his
fool machine

 bills yellow-fever run

by sam henry

the true story series a mail train has to make a run
a across the state border to a town seventy-two miles distant and return
before midnight at which time owing to a yellow-fever quarantine
the draw over a certain river would be turned and no traffic allowed to enter
the county the train left on its trip at  pm having before it the stu-
pendous task of crossing two trestles blocking six grades unloading mail
taking on oil and water and returning over the same ground all by twelve
oclock it arrived at its destination at  and started upon the return trip
at  traveling part of the time at the rate of more than a mile a minute

true story number fifty-five

the boys back in the mail car were wondering most of the time if
no  would make the trip without leaving
the rails

   there is  limit to the authority of the
county and village health boards and at
the rate they tie and untie traffic they seem
to be panic-stricken

   it was six years ago when i was up
against the real thing it was almost im-
possible to move a train because the com-
pany could not get men who had been in
a given place long enough to be allowed to
enter or pass through another county

   between new orleans and the texas
state line the southern pacific had cut die
service from four daily trains to one each
way and it was not an easy matter to
maintain even this service operated merely
to deliver mail and to give quick relief in
expressing food

series began in the october  railroad mana magazine single copies  cents

         you talk to the boys of the
         southern pacific you will be
         told of some remarkably fast
         runs which were made on that
         line and he who tells the story
         will start his narrative by say-
         ing  it equaled bills yellow-fever run

  if there is anything that gives railroad
men a nightmare it is trying to operate
trains during yellow-fever epidemics one
county quarantines against another one
village against another others will have
no quarantine restrictions at all the com-
pany will receive instructions from a coun-
ty that no trains will be allowed to stop
there then in a day or so the restrictions
will be removed


the railroad mans magazine

  there were few passengers because it
was difficult to tell when quarantine offi-
cers would board the train with restrictions
against the locality from which the trav-
elers might come

  all the passenger crews between lafay-
ette and houston had been caught on the
texas side except one and this crew dou-
bled the road daily from lafayette to the
texas state line

  bill the engineer was what we call a
 goer whenever he was late or received
his train late he did not use the whole
division to make up the lost time but
pounded his engine until the time was
gained he didnt believe in wasting steam
making long whistles for blind sidings
but gave a little startling puff and kept
going

  to bill all track was first-class unless
there were special orders or signals out
on the date that this particular run of which

i	am writing was made we arrived at mer-
mentau the county line of calcasieu coun-
ty which flew quarantine signals no one
was allowed to get off in this county and
any one coming east of lafayette could
not so much as pass through

hie draw would be turned

  we arrived at mermentau at  pm
the health board had just passed new re-
strictions that the draw over mermentau
river would be turned and no traffic al-
lowed in the county after twelve oclock but
the railroad company was trying to get an
extension of time so as to allow our train
and crew to return the next morning

  we had about thirty thousand pounds
of mail aboard which we were scheduled
to deliver at the texas state line there
was time in which to make the required
trip but in order to maintain the service
between lafayette and mermentau our crew
would have to be at the latter place

  bill suggested that our train be cut down
to a coach for the crew and the mail-car
and he assured his listeners that he would
have us there and back before twelve oclock
the time set for the enforcement of the new
restrictions

  no one thought it could be done as it
was then about nine oclock and we would
have to cover a distance of a fraction over
one hundred and forty miles flag six rail-
road crossings take oil and water cross
four trestles of two miles eachjrith slow

signals over them allow time to unload
our mail go round the wye at the state
line and return

  however we made ready for the trip
as quickly as possible just before start-
ing i heard bill tell one of the express
messengers who was left behind to have
a bottle of nervine ready for the four
mail-clerks upon their return we will
be back by  not later than 
he said

maintaining high speed

  by a quick mental calculation we knew
that to make this run we would have to
maintain a speed of seventy miles an hour
our engine was a very large one with -
inch drivers we got our signal at 
pm on the start we could scarcely keep
our feet it seemed as if die car was pull-
ing right from under us

  we stopped at jennings threw off eight
hundred pounds of mail slowed down at
welsh louisiana flagged watkins cross-
ing stopped five minutes at lake charles
water-tank for oil and water three minutes
at lake charles threw off two thousand
pounds mail flagged kcs crossing were
three minutes crossing calcasieu trestle and
flagged lock-moore crossing

  at edgerlv where there is a slight curve
-so slight that a speed of fort or fifty
miles an hour is not noticeable-one of
the boys was getting a drink holding to
the cooler which was tightly fastened
the swing wrfs so sudden that he jerked
the cooler loose and with it struck the
opposite side of the car breaking out a
window light

  we passed sulphur so fast that the opera-
tor there had called up his old friend at
vinton the station beyond edgerlv and
told him to look out for no  saying
 shes going like a meteor

  vinton-replied  i see her headlight now
coming round the curve at edgerlv five
miles away theres an awful cloud of
dust and a sudden roar outside like a storm
coming up no i dont see no s head-
light any more

the operator convinced

  about tiiat time he heard the operator
at the state line reporting no  in sight
he went outside and found the night clear
and still the mail-sacks we had dropped
bills yellow-fever run



and a yearling thrown up on a five-foot
platform and mashed flat against the de-
pot all this convinced him that no 
had passed

  he jestingly called up the operator at
the state line and asked to be told when we
started back that he might go out in the
prairie and view us from a distance then
perhaps he would be able to report us when
we passed

  we arrived at the state line at 
pm while we were unloading bill went
round the wye and coupled on we were
ready to start back at  pm with
seventy-two minutes left in which to make
the seventy miles there were two long
trestles to cross going over them we
could not make over eighteen miles an hour
there were also three railroad crossings to
flag

  before we started on the return trip i
heard the conductor tell bill that the post-
office people at lake charles wanted us to
stop there one minute so they could clean
out  that office as there was no telling how
long the tie-up would last

  the conductor said  i have told them
we cannot do it and they are trying now
to get a five-minutes respite on the turn of
that draw so that we can stop

  bill replied tell em to have their mail
at the depot in about twenty-five minutes
well stop we dont need the respite

 minutes for  miles

  we left the state line at  pm and
stopped at lake charles at  pm
having flagged the two railroad crossings
and gone slowly across- the two trestles
leaving lake charles we had thirty-two
minutes in which to make thirty-seven miles
and to flag one railroad crossing

  in the mail-car we did not believe this
could be done so after leaving one of the
boys went ahead to the coach where the

train crew was to see if diey were going
to allow us the extra five minutes he was
told that it was impossible and that we
had just as well prepare for a long camp
on this side

  by this time everything outside seemed
to be a solid mass-we were going so fast
our car was fairly dancing and some of
us were walking the floor looking rather
wild

  we covered lake charles to watkins
crossing twelve miles in ten minutes
welsh ten miles seven minutes roan-
oke four miles and one half three minutes
and a half jennings five miles and a half
four minutes

like the whip-crack game

  before reaching a very sharp curve at
jennings we were certain bill would hold
them a little but so far as we could tell
he did not make a check i have heard of
trains going around curves with only the
outside wheel on the rail and i am ready
to believe that that was the case with us
at any rate i was reminded of the old
 whip-crack  game i used to play at
school when i was on the tail end

  we covered the distance from jennings
to mermentau five miles in a few seconds
less than four minutes and thundered across
the draw at wslyz oclock

  every man in the mail-car was ready to
thank heaven it was over

  we found bill as cool as could be smo-
king his old pipe and looking over his en-
gine when i congratulated him he said

   the old girl did rock a little on those
curves while i knew we had plenty of
time to get across she was doing such pret-
ty work i did not have the heart to shut
her off

   thats good track along there and if
it had been necessary she could have done
it one minute and a half sooner
jonas and his convictions

by mac duffie martin

            he was brought face to face with outlaws
            before he learned the value of relenting

fonas okeman had been a crea-
ture of convictions from child-
hood up to gray hairs usually
such as he are not content with
pampering pet ideas or cherish-
ing chosen practises instead
they want the universal adoption of their
whim-whams to everything in life

  jonas was otherwise all he asked was
that he be allowed to gnaw his bone of un-
dictated beliefs undisturbed by the yelps of
the orthodox or the cold noses of the dis-
approving and the meddlesome such im-
munity was not always his however for the
conventional insistently consider a depart-
ure from conventionality as a rebuke and
a challenge but jonas refused to purchase
peace at the sacrifice of free speech or ac-
tion he had about him a touch of the
porcupine

  he never looked for trouble yet he de-
clined to get out of the way of it when he
saw it bearing down upon him

  jonass name was placed on the scholars
roll of the little school in the tiny new
hampshire village where he first opened a
pair of blinky eyes in this old school he
discovered that the governmental rules
among his fellows were as simple as they
were effective-up to the time they clashed
with his convictions

  for instance if ike smith could whip
billy jones and billy jones could whip
joe robinson and joe robinson could
thrash you you were supposed to unmur-
muringly accept the dictum that smith and
jones could not only do you-but do
you good whenever the fancy seized them
the arrangement was satisfactory to the big
boys and fraught with much unhappiness
to the smaller ones

  but to jonas came a conviction of a revo-

lutionary sort he couldnt see why he
should be walloped by the twenty just be-
cause he had failed to wallop the one and
he said as much then  red  flanagen
who could thump  tode  allen who best-
ed jonas on his first day at school twisted
the latters nose until its tip assumed the
hue of a frosted beet jonas urged by pain
and a sense of the righteousness of his be-
liefs flew at red like a small catamount

  he bit scratched kicked hit and yelled
at one and the same time and ever and
anon butted his antagonist in the stomach

  red the astonished tripped and fell
whereupon i regret to say jonas jumped
on him and tried to fill his eyes and mouth
with new hampshire soil then the school-
bell rang but red being unpresentable
played hookey

  after school pindy milliken the
next warrior in succession undertook to lift
jonas off the ground by his ears jonas
in whose veins the joy of battle was still
tingling repeated his whirlwind tactics
although pindy came out the victor he
did so at the expense of a tooth and a galaxy
of bruises	

  been fighting boy asked jonass
father the village hamess-maker

   yes dad replied die youngster whose
conviction was that his appearance ren-
dered the confession necessary

  what for

  jonas recited the facts of the case-and
he always told the trutli

  mr okeman reflected then he gave
jonas five cents

  its wrong to fight he said but its
wrong to run awav when you know you be

 o			j

in die right

  so jonas with the parental approval
backing his convictions lived for a week
jonas and his convictions



  amid combat then his father meeting
  some of the larger boys remarked casually
  that if any one of them laid fhrther hands
  on his son hed take a hand in the matter
  himself the larger boys secretly glad to
  secure peace with jonas humbly yielded to
  a show of superior force

    so the old order of things departed and
  from thence on each boy stood on his in-
  dividual pugilistic ground

    another time the teacher a bumptious
  young man forbade the boys going fishing
  or swimming during recess in the willow-
  shaded stream that ran through a field -not
  far from the schoolhouse 

    reasons for the ukase were not given
  jonas had a conviction that the teachers
  jurisdiction over him began and ended with
  the school-hours

    so at noon that day he caught  shiners 
  and swam across crosbys hole the
  teacher saw him and the teacher thrashed
  him jonas hurled a ruler and several
  books at the teacher then he made a
  dash for the door and sped to his fathers
  shop he told the story to his father who
  cuffed him thrice for throwing things at
  the teacher and then patted him on the
  head for being a brave lad

    slipping a short but stout dog-whip into
  his pocket the elder okeman rose and bade
  his son follow

    the interview with the teacher that fol-
  lowed was brief

     youve punished this here boy of mine
  for something he done when he wasnt in
  school who gave you the -right to do
  that asked the elder okeman

    he disobeyed orders

    orders that youd no right to give
  now see here young man youve either
  got to say youre sorry and mighty sorry
  for this or you can take a licking from me
  or ill have you arrested for sault and
  battery which is it to be come

    the teacher apologized and jonas his
  convictions vindicated neither fished nor
  swam again during recess

    jonass mother died a few days after his
  birth a maiden aunt kept house for the
   widower and his son the latter learned
  his fathers trade and had just attained his
  majority when his father died and he came
  into possession of the business

    jonas grew to mans estate and became
  the real thing in the old-line country
  merchant

    his financial standing wgs pretty fair

      	r r

the stock of the business was worth about
one hundred and fifty dollars the weekly
income averaged ten dollars and there was
about three thousand dollars lying to his
credit in the guernsey bank sandston
twenty miles away

  besides he owned the cottage that he and
the aunt lived in and had an equity in a
small stony farm altogether he was
looked upon as one of the solid young men
of the community for in those days people
had not that contempt for hundreds that
even hearsay contact with millions inspires
now

  jonas had his full share of the thrift-
iness that is begotten of life amid grudging
ground and bleak breezes and many were
the talks that he had with his one-time boy-
ish foe but now closest friend tode other-
wise theodore allen in regard to ways and
means of expanding the currency

  allen was the son of a well-to-do farmer
cows and plows and chilblains however
were not to his liking so after much pa-
rental opposition he secured a place in the
guernsey bank first as office-boy and later
as clerk as a side issue he took the local
agency of a boston life insurance company

  on several occasions theodore attempted
to persuade jonas to take out a modest policy
on his life but one of jonass rock-ribbed
convictions was that such companies ex-
isted for the purpose of making rich their
officers and making poor their policy-
holders all the talk in the world would
not move him

   i have my convictions said jonas

  the days came and went with jonas in
peaceful prosperous fashion the maiden
aunt died and in her place he installed a
wife she being the daughter of the village
carpenter goodly was she to look upon
and good tempered withal for jonas had
a profound conviction that nearly all mar-
ried unhappiness arose from acid dispo-
sitions on the part of one or both of the
contracting parties

  the stony farm had been sold at a good
round profit to a company who wanted a
portion of it for factory purposes jonas
acting on a hint given him by a boston
friend made several other investments which
turned out well he was being looked upon
by his neighbors as an unusually fortunate
man

  one day the good childless wife died
jonas remained but not many of the things
or people of his schoolboy days were left


the railroad mans magazine

factories were springing up in and about
the viljage and strange faces were many

  his trade had dwindled to a mere noth-
ing-a fact that gave him but little con-
cern financially the guernsey bank had
passed into the hands of strangers-a hap-
pening that worried him greatly many of
his friends had gone elsewhere-for a rail-
road is destructive to the instinct of lo-
cality

  tode allen had long ago emigrated to
the west jonas felt a stranger in his own
land he was fifty-nine years old in
good health comfortable circumstances and
yet poor in the things that make life worth
living

  fate had given to him and taken from
him unsparingly and now he was harbor-
ing a growing conviction that congenial hu-
man companionship would be infinitely
preferable to his present state of loneliness

  so he wrote to allen with whom he had
kept up a desultory correspondence for
years allen had had his fill of fun and
danger in the west and at length had lo-
cated in a permanently prosperous mining
region in colorado-a region of frame
houses a brick church and holes in the
mountainsides that cost millions to make
and maintain

  he had struck the place at the inception
of its prosperity opened a general store
gave credit liberally and won confidence
and respect by his fair dealing and fearless-
ness in the course of his upward progress
he started a bank he was its manager
cashier teller and janitor

  the bank flourished amazingly be-
sides the local business which was not in-
considerable it had a savings department
that grew with the months and the amount
of money that it sent each week to europe
and the eastern states to relatives of the
miners ran into thousands

  tode allen partly through his expe-
riences with western conditions and partly
through his early absorption of new eng-
land conservatism made investments that
would have met with the approval of even
jonas

  incidentally allen had married his
son who was now bordering on early man-
hood was one of the bank-tellers

  allen had never forgotten that his cur-
rent good fortune was more or less directly
due to jonas the financial end of the
obligation had been discharged years be-
fore but tode wanted to do more for hi

old friend among other things he had
on several occasions written him begging
him to visit the dunstans level region as
the mining center was called

  finally jonas made up his mind to go

  on the day -that he arrived tode and his
son were at the depot to greet him

  ive come out here to stay said jonas
that night after a jolly dinner

  bully uncle jonas chimed in
young allen between whom and the visitor
a great friendship had arisen

  mrs allen smiled approvingly and
asked now mr okeman you are going
to make your home with us we can make
you quite comfortable

  thanks maam but id rather not
id better live elsewhere answered jonas

  the allens looked puzzled  fact is y
see went on jonas  im getting old and
a bit fidgety and have my fads and fan-
cies on me sometimes and im not going
to upset this household with any such fool-
ishness so with your help mrs allen
im going to find a place of my own near
by where i can growl and go to sleep with
my boots on and behave scandalous with
the dinner and nobody to say peppermint
to me

  persuasion was useless and the end of
the week saw him comfortably installed in
a four-room cottage about a hundred yards
from the allen house the ancient but act-
ive widow of a miner acted as housekeeper
for him he saw as much of the allens as
ever theodore jr and jonas became the
greater friends with the passing of the
weeks

  one day jonas dropped in at the bank

    tode said he  i want to have a chat
with vou the manager led the wav to

 	sd	j

the private office the interview was brief
jonas had a conviction that it would be a
good thing for him to realize on his eastern
investments and open a deposit account with
the proceeds in the first bank of dun-
stans level this conviction was followed
by the action and two months later jonas
okeman was credited on the books of the
bank with 

and mind you tode said he as he
received his bank-book  much as i like
you i wouldnt have put a penny with you
if you hadnt assured me that you hadnt
any dealings whatsoever with any darned
insurance company in the way of taking
their stock or paper for collateral if you
ever should be tempted to fall from grace
jonas and his convictions



in the way of loaning any of those chaps
money youll please notify me before you
do so so that i can get out right away
its an agreement i promise replied
the other  but jonas you are prejudiced
beyond reason some of the financially
strongest corporations in this country are
insurance companies

   mebbe mebbe but i hold to my con-
victions

   as you always did chuckled allen
as i always did and this-waving
his bank-book-is what i made by em
the miners provident and insurance
association of dunstans level was that
which its name implied the level was
only  unionized  to a small degree the
associatipn in a fashion took the place of
the unions among the unorganized men by
guaranteeing weekly sums in case of death
sickness and in some instances destitution
each payment being in kind and proportion
to the amount of the members fee

   it was a small but sound institution that
was well patronized by the miners eastern
men were behind it and it had the approval
of the majority of jnine-owners its funds
were almost entirely invested in safe prop-
erties owned by its backers

  erasmus whopple the manager of the
association prior to becoming connected
with it had been successful in insurance
circles which means that he ate drank
slept and talked insurance affairs and
things appertaining thereto from morn till
night such is the essential and the pen-
alty of achievement in that profession which
looks upon mankind only from the view-
point of a  risk

   for the rest mr whopple was large
heavy-voiced and somewhat self-important
he wore a massiye gold watch-chain and
his white vest was in evidence at all sea-
sons of the year he had a profound be-
lief in the infallibility of his judgment

   mr whopple was the one fly in the oth-
erwise unpolluted ointment of jonass con-
tent being a friend of the allens the
associations manager was not infrequently
at their home where to jonass intense dis-
gust he would pour forth a flood of insu-
rance talk from the time of his entrance to
the hour of his exit

   occasionally jonas would cause a mo-
ments check of the turgid torrent by sar-
castic comment or dry retort after which
erasmus would boom and thunder along
with added volume

  queries on die part of jonas as to
whether mr whopple had ever insured a
man against being talked to death by an
agent or whether any policy issued by him
contained a restrictive clause against kill-
ing a jibbering jackass will sufficiently
indicate his feeling regarding the manager
in course of time jonas passed from pas-
sive distaste to active dislike of mr whop-
ple and mr whopple regarded jonas with
emotions much die reverse to friendly

  in the following spring ripples of
trouble began to fleck the usually placid
surface of life at dunstans level there
was a strike among the miners-a bitter
penetrating hot-blooded strike

  the inevitable followed there was a
rush of outside men who were only too
glad to get a foothold these men were
met and threatened by the strikers and the
elements of trouble were in evidence on
every hand

  by may dunstans level was in per-
petual turmoil many of the mines were
closed because of the inability of the local
authorities to protect their employees
there had been bloodshed and trade was
at a standstill

  theodore allen was diplomatic and re-
fused to be drawn into any active partizan-
sliip or even discussion all he would say
was that he hoped for everybodys sake
that the trouble would be settled to every-
bodys satisfaction very quickly

  mr whopple however used his fatal
gift of words in unstinted denunciation of
strikes and strikers he had not lived in
the west long enough to know the value of
silence in times of trouble

  jonas okeman had an outspoken convic-
tion that things were going to be a sight
worse before they got better

  theodore jr rather enjoyed the situa-
tion having the love of a  scrap  common
to red-blooded youth

   then came a series of sympathetic strikes
thugs and thieves smelling prospective
plunder began to rendezvous at the place
violence increased and pretty nearly every
citizen went armed by day and slept with
his gun within reach by night

  in the interval there had been a steady
withdrawal of funds from the bank and a
coincident demand on the resources of the
association

  one afternoon jonas okeman was vis-
ited by theodore jr who seemed to be out
of breath


the railroad mans magazine

   dad wants to see you right away un-
cle he said

  why

    dont know but clad isnt given to hur-
ry tilings unless lies got a reason for it
he wants to know when you can come to
the bank  

   tell him ill be there in live minutes
   theodore jr departed

   jonas said allen in the sanctum of
the bank  whopple has got himself into
trouble by shooting off his mouth
naturally chuckled jonas

   but thats not all hes likely to get
me-or the bank-into serious trouble
also

  jonas said something under his breath
you see went on allen in the east
a man may fail for a million or so half a
dozen times during his business career and
bob up serenely after cash arrangements
with his creditors here in the west-at
least in the mining districts and so far as
regards a business like mine-its totally
different

  if i should happen to once go down
id never get up again a man who has
the reputation of being off the square among
these men may as well- get out and never
come back

  well well said jonas what of it-
what of it

  this much replied his friend
 whopple by his fool talk has got a black
mark against him in the miners books
yesterday the finance committee of the as-
sociation waited on him and asked him for
a subscription the committee knew well
enough that hed refuse

naturally chuckled jonas again
well the committee left and a little
later i received a tip from one of my friends
that to-morrow afternoon a run will begin
on the association that will close its doors
jonas grinned broadly

  thats all very well cried allen as
he eyed jonas sharply  but such a run may
mean shutting up the bank also

  jonas sobered instantly how he
asked

  just this way these fellows here are
like sheep if one takes alarm so do the
others you cant reason with them the
association and our bank both have their
money if suspicion attacks one institu-
tion the other is bound to be more or less
affected and in the same disastrous way
both of our doors will be besieged

   well said jonas impatiently

   well replied allen ive told whop-
ple what ive heard he in his self-satis-
fied manner refuses to believe it two
days hence hell learn the truth of it to his
cost and sorrow

  well asked jonas again

  we must save him retorted allen
 from the consequences of his folly for our
own sakes-if you consent

  whatn thunder dye mean cried
jonas

    simply this if theres a run on the
association whopple so ive ascertained
will need about thirty thousand to meet it
and restore confidence i know absolutely
that the association is sound and that he
can get all the money he wants from the
east twenty-four hours after his eyes have
been opened but his eyes have got to be
opened

  now if he does make good during the
first hours of the run the bank will not be
jeopardized because the panic will be
checked and the confidence of the miners
restored if he isnt helped out you know
what the consequences will be

    we are perfectly solvent but owing to
the current condition of affairs it would be
several days before we could borrow money
or realize on our securities the question
isnt one of days but of hours

  well asked jonas once more

   it amounts to this we must if we can
help whopple by letting him have all the
cash he wants on the security of the associa-
tion-notes or stock-or take chances of
going down in the crash that will follow
the associations temporary suspension
then you want- began jonas

    i dont want you to run counter to your
convictions said allen with a ghost of a
smile but ive put the situation before
you i am keeping my promise to you in
regard to a prospective fall from grace as
you once put it im contemplating a tem-
porary alliance with an insurance concern
not from choice but from necessity

   now jonas im not going to disguise
the fact that if you withdraw your deposit
at this juncture it will add immensely to
my difficulties in fact it may prevent my
helping whopple altogether and so bring
about that which im trying to avert but
ill stand by my agreement nevertheless
and give you your cash right on the spot
weve got nearly twenty-six thousand in
the safe in currency
jonas and his convictions



  why do they start the trouble to-raor-
rovv afternoon instead of the morning

   to prevent whopple from wiring to his
eastern people for help in time to stall off
the continuance of the run the result will
be that the morning after next the associa-
tion will be surrounded by a howling mob
theyll want blood or money nothing
short of one or the other will save whopple
and if he goes down so do i

  whopple is a consarned polecat said
jonas slowly if it hadnt been for him
you wouldnt be in this peck of worry see
here tode you know im not a young man
and if i lose my pile i cant hope to make
it again and i dont exactly like whopple

   i want you to give me till to-morrow
morning to think this thing over its kind
o sudden you know my convictions are
that youre somehow or other doin a fool-
ish thing-but im a bit fogged on this
point anyhow ill let you know early to-
morrow	

  that night as jonas sat in his cottage
struggling with his convictions and his in-
clinations-the first prompting him to with-
draw his money from the bank and the last
to allow it to remain-there came a knock
at the door	

  jonas answered it outside stood a tall
bearded man he declined to enter

  young allens got into a fight up at
wide slide said the visitor  and got
pretty badly done up he wants you to
come to him cause he wants you to tell
his people

  jonas felt his knees tremble wide
slide was the aristocratic suburb of the
level

  is he badly hurt jonas queried
top of die head and arm busted said
the miner nothing terrible but he
wants to see you bad

  jonas did not hesitate in a few minutes
he was trudging by the side of his guide
wide slide was a natural sort of terrace on
the side of the mountain that overlooked the
level-a street of spacious distances and
pleasant phonies three streets ran to the
slide from the business portion of the level
up one of which the two men climbed

  where is he- gasped jonas as they
reached the terrace which was dimly lit
and shaded by trees

   down here a bit answered the other
turning to the south

  jonas followed then he felt something
like a sack thrown over his head his feet

were kicked from under him ropes were
deftly fastened round his arms and legs

  he was raised on the shoulders of his
captors hurried first over smooth and then
rough ground and at length half suffo-
cated shaken by his fall and suffering from
the shock of his abduction he lost con-
sciousness

  when jonas recovered his senses he
found himself lying on a heap of sacks in
what was evidently the deserted working of
a mine from certain indications and in
spite of his half-dazed condition he came
to the conclusion that the mine itself was
abandoned

  a few yards away a fire blazed merrily
fed by chunky pieces of what once had been
roof supporters on the other side of the
lire and on more sacks lounged more men
one of them being the black-bearded man

  jonas blinked hazily at the blaze for a
few moments and then asked weakly
where be i

  at the national hotel denver
laughed black beard excuse the looks
of things but were having our fall round-
up of the furniture and the pictures for
cleaning purposes an theyll be back to-
morrow

  quit it jake said a slim light-
haired man surlily weve no time to
waste in foolin here you he added to
jonas take a swallow youll need it
fore we get through with you

   jonas refused

   ive got a conviction he said that i
aint exactly in the hands of my friends

   that depends said the slim man

    you do as youre told and youll find us
friendly enough if you dont well-
here he gave a picturesque and sufficiently
blood-curdling description of what would
befall the captive

   all of which highly improving lan-
guage leads up to what asked jonas

  were appointed a committee to collect
money to help along the cause from them as
wont give up willing jedging by the way
youve been shooting off yer mouth since the
strike begun you aint too-much prejudiced
for the likes of us

   consequent it was felt that it was no
good as gentlemen to ask you to give up
like a gendeman consequent this here
committee with powers fully pinted has
brought you here to-night to make you do
the square thing

  go on said jonas

    so this here committee asks you to hand
over that four-story pile of yours which is
rusting for want of using in allens bank
how much of it did you say you was
convinced you wanted said jonas po-
litely

   all of it-every greasy dollar

  not having my books handy i cant
say whats my balance said jonas

  dont let that loco you interrupted
another of the men well just assess
you fifteen thousand dollars and let you
off easy

  but how can i put up when im shut
up here and aint got my check-book
complained jonas

  you just write an order for the cash
to bearer sign another order and well do
the rest declared the slim man

  and if i refuse drawled jonas

  black beard smiled grimly  i wouldnt
shoot down a poor stubborn mule of a crit-
ter in cold blood not for nothing he said
 id only wall him up out of the way where
people couldnt find him and let him have
a few rattlers for company

but interrupted one of the others
not afore wed toasted his feet a bit-
these here holes being sure chilly at nights
thats right assented black beard
 and my horse dont object-

  a growl and a warning glance at the
speaker from the slim man cut the sentence
short but the incident was not lost on
jonas

  miners as a rule do not own horses he
had already noted the fact that when a bit
of rock fell from the rocking every mans
right hand flashed to where his holster
should have been

   jonas had a conviction that he was in the
hands not of striking miners but of one of
the bands of desperadoes that had been at-
tracted to the level by the prevailing law-
lessness it was also evident that his cap-
ture had been carefully planned-the ruse
by which he had been lured from his home
proved that

   where is young allen   he asked the
slim man after a brief silence

   dont know and dont give a hang
was the reply

  black beard gave a howl of laughter
you for certain was roped easy by that
there tale of mine i thought it would
fetch you seeing how frightful fond you is
of the kid

  jonas muttered an inward prayer of

thankfulness the expression on his face
caught the eye of the slim man who smiled
cruelly

  why you infernal brood of horse-
thieves and rustlers howled jonas do
you think anybody would take you for
honest miners look at each others faces
you gallows dogs 

  one of the men struck him knocking
him down

    i wont say as you havent guessed near
right pard he said  but anyhow since
you give us the name well have the game
so being as we be horse-thieves we give
you notice that your time for rounding-up
your ideas about that cash is cut out at five
oclock in the morning

  then if that cash aint to be ours it
wont be yours no more in the same way
pard if we couldnt make use of your car-
cass while you was alive we call it cer-
tain unfair to let you use it alive either
after all the trouble we have took about
you

  jonas lay and watched the fire in a
numbed fashion his mouth and eyes were
burning his legs faint from fatigue and
sore from bruises a request for a drink
of water had been refused his mind
wouldnt respond to his attempts to arrange
his thoughts in coherent order he doubted
the happenings of the night and lay for a
time patiently expecting himself to wake
in his bed in his cottage

  gradually however his nerves grew
steady at length he was able to sanely
ponder on his situation it was clear then
that if he acceded to the demands of the
gang he would ruin his friend allen and
allen was a year older than himself with
a wife and family dependent on him

  allen had said that if the bank once
closed his financial career would be end-
ed and he was too far advanced in years
to begin a new career then again young
allens prospects would be badly blighted
-and he loved the lad

  if he refused to comply with the de-
mands allen and the boy and unluckily
whopple would prosper be happy and
wonder at the mysterious disappearance of
the old man whom the allens had loved
and who had loved them so much in turn
jonas almost wished that he had insured
his life as allen had suggested for then
he wouldnt be in such a fix

  however he extracted a grain of com-
fort from the fact that if he still refused
jonas and his convections



to do the gangs bidding and they carried
out their threats the boy would be none
the worse for that for he had within the
month made a will in favor of theodore
allen jr naming him as sole beneficiary

  by the time that the fatal hour had al-
most arrived jonas had lost all sense of
fear spurred by the conviction that he
was about to be deprived not only of all
that makes life worth living but of life
itself by a band of outlaws the blind rage
of the thwarted fell upon him

  the men were sleeping about him one
having been ordered to stay awake and
watch the prisoner

  ere the sentry could arm himself jonas
grabbed a chunk of smoldering wood from
the fire and felled hint

  there was an outer- in an instant all
was uproar and the flashing of hitherto con-
cealed knives and pistols

  black beard dexterously smote jonass
wrist with the butt of a revolver and his
fiery weapon fell to the ground jonas fell
too under the pressure of the revolver-butt

  jonas eyed the battered sentry with fero-
cious satisfaction there was plenty of
fight in the old man and he struggled to
his feet and struck a blow at the closest of
his captors he paid for his trouble by
being bound with ropes while the slim man
sat astride his chest

  now said the leader drawing his
knife  im going to ask you twice if your
going to do as we wants about the coin
if you say  no then therell be a burying
in this here working afore breakfast once
will you pard

  jonas while feeling that either his life
or his fortune would be disposed of within
the next few seconds could not help noticing
that the garments of the gang were shabby
and dilapidated and that each man looked
hollow-eyed and hungry	v

  twice will you pard

  a magnificent conviction seized jonas
the eyes of the slim man glittered

   let me upy you consarned lunatic 
shouted jonas suddenly  i want to talk
business to you

  what for did you say pard queried
the slim man still astride jonass chest

  he said what for retorted one of the
others irritatedly let him up

  look here you chaps blurted jonas
 i guess youre doing this because you had
to or thought you had to times being hard
and stomachs empty

  well heres my first last and final
proposition to you you poor miserable un-
washed starving no-accounts as couldnt get
into a measly ten-cent limit game ill give
you twenty-five hundred dollars in cash to
divvy-cash mind you without your ta-
king die risk of going to the bank-and ill
put it so as the law cant touch you make
it a sort of business deal you understand

   so there you are six hundred dollars
eacl and a hundred thrown in to buy
sticking-plaster for this poor gentlemans
face

  black beard with a rock-rifting oath
swore that the proposition was good enough
for him so did the others the slim man
hesitated

   wheres this liete cash you talk about 
he asked

  its in a desk in my bedroom ive
got the key in my pocket i can send the
key and a note to my housekeeper asking
her to give the money to the bearer ill
invent some excuse to explain my being
away all night you can also have an
agreement signed by me that i paid you the
money for putting me onto a valuable piece
of mining property and jonas took a rue-
ful glance at his surroundings

   hang me  declared the black-bearded
uian  if i aint half sorry that i had a
hand in this-youre such a real old hoss

  after some objections on the part of the
slim one it was so arranged

  two of the men took the letter and the
key and started for dunstans level while
black beard remained guard over jonas
a fourth man was sent down the trail to
watch developments

  jonass housekeeper had overheard the
conversation between him and black beard
at the cottage door at midnight she went
to the allen home to ascertain the coridi
tion of young allen and to find out if her
employer intended to remain away from
home all night

  the story resulted in the authorities be-
ing notified and a posse of citizens formed
within the hour at five oclock in the
morning the warden of the states prison
arrived with a leash of bloodhounds

  the scent was quickly found by the dogs
and was being easily carried when round
a sharp turn of the trail came the two mem-
bers of the gang who were on their way to
jonass house

  they turned and ran revolvers and
rifles began to spit and crack the slim


the railroad mans magazine

man went down with a shattered elbow
the other threw up his hands

  the dogs took up the scent with renewed
enthusiasm the third of the gang hav-
ing had a previous experience with man-
hunting dogs simply chucked away his
gun climbed a handy boulder and awaited
the approach of the party

  then the chase led on to the deserted
mine black beard heard the dogs ap-
proaching bestowed a hasty kick on the
nearest shin of jonas and departed into the
devious ways of the workings and escaped

  tode said jonas feebly as he was
half carried half led down the trail  you
can use that money of mine as you see fit
ive a conviction that things will turn out
all right for all of us

 mr okeman sir boomed whopple
who had been much in evidence with a
large belt and a small revolver  i desire
to tender you my profound congratulations
on your escape from dangers and-difficulties
such as we often peruse in the pages of
fiction but seldom meet in the volumes of
real life i do assure you sir that when
i heard of your predicament i did not hesi-
tate to forthwith arm myself and join the
gallant body of my fellow citizens who set
forth to rescue or revenge you

  thank you whopple whispered jo-
nas  ive a conviction that youre not a
bad sort-for an insurance man

the passen

stoggs is a very sociable man he likes to
talk with any person with whom lie happens
to be traveling he made a trip up the little
miami railroad the other day and found a seat
alongside of a solemn-looking man who kept his
gaze out of the window stoggs tried to catch
his eye so as to open a conversation with him
but he didnt succeed

  stoggs offered the man his paper the man
shook his head without looking around the con-
ductor came along and stoggs said to himself
 surely he must look around now but he didnt

  a man in front handed out two tickets and
pointed silently to stoggss companion stoggs
began to grow uneasy it was the longest time
he had ever been in a strangers company without
finding out something about him-where lie was
pointing for at least

  at length the brakeman came with some water
and thejnan turned around to get some stoggs
availed himself of the opportunity to say

   going far east as new york 

   no growled the man

    then he turned to his favorite speaking
  with considerable softness

    theodore boy ive a growing belief
  that youll be president if you escape being
  a general or one of them napoleons down
  wall street way

   that night jonas okeman deliberately
  called on erasmus whopple after a long
  and convincing conversation with his land-
  lady whopple was nearly dumfounded
  he actually trembled as he led the old man
  into his little sitting-room

   whopple said okeman without any
  preliminary sparring-  ive a conviction
  that id better have my life insured after
  all seems to me as if its a pretty good
  way to hold your money them highway-
  men wouldnt have much use for a policy
  would they im a pretty old man but i
  guess you can fix me up something in the
  association for about ten thousand make
  it out to tode allens kid hes all i
  care for

   fix you out thundered the voluble
  whopple why sir i can fix you out
  easy with our special bond policy greatest
  thing in the land greatest and most
  effective method ever devised under the stars
  and stripes to aid humanity and build up-
  and on rolled the wordy whopple paint-
  ing picture after picture of glories greater
  than dreams while jonas sat listening for-
  getting that he had any convictions

gers reply

     stoggs waited until the stranger had quaffed a
  pretty liberal quaff when he remarked

      new york is a dull place at this time of year
  anyhow mebbe youre striking for philadelphia
  to see whether the old towns changed any since
  the exposition

    the surly man gave an impatient shake of his
  head

     perhaps clevelands your destination   put in
  stoggs not at all disconcerted

     no the man growled

      cant be youre going this roundabout way to
  chicago 

     to this the stranger didnt offer a reply of any
  kind then stoggs rose up and twisted around
  a little fronting the stranger and said

      i spose youve no objection to telling where
  you are going 

      hang it  cried the man  im going up for
  seven years 

     then the deputy sheriff in front told stoggs that
  hed rather not have folks talking to his prisoners
  and stoggs hadnt anything further to sa

ten thousand miles by rail

by gilson willets

special traveling correspondent of the railroad mans magazine 

no -in the sunflower state

how a kansas bad man was put out of commission-what the law
demands-the breckenridge family-the bronco buster-

a mad race with a cyclone

es son the first time i out
  my lamps on  double-l
  eck  turner was about
  third - drink time pm
  while he was pasturin on
  the bod-walk in front of
  a nose-paint wickeyup in dodge city the
  speaker was an old ranchman from texas

	whom i had met at the station in kansas
 city while waiting for the rock islands
 golden state limited to pull out for the
 southwestern country

  the aged  rough - neck as he called
himself had delivered a train-load of cat-
tle in kansas city and was now waiting
for a santa fe train to take him to dodge
city having spoken of dodge city he
began telling of the deeds of bad men in
that town in the old days finally mention-
ing  double-l eck  turner

   i knew that eck got the sign and signal
smoke of his name he continued  from
the  double-l  which was the brand of the
leonard and loughrain ranch for which

series began in june  railroad mans magazine single cooics  cents




the railroad mans magazine

eck turner was a rider and i had lis-
tened when it was said that eck was one of
the worst men in kansas

   but thats whatever

   when i first put my lamps on eck on
said bod-walk on the main street of dodge
he was some dangerous to look at-special-
ly when looked at by them tourists that wte
then infestin dodge owin to the persistence
of santa fe trains in bringin em into
dodges midst

  ecks dislike for tourists was mortal in
general and when he saw one ridin a
hoss he just nacherally yearned for blood-
spillin

  well son in a minute or prior there-
to eck spies a party on a hoss coinin down
main street it was a party that eck mis-
took for another of them tourists the hoss-
man im aloodin to werent no tourist at
all though he was branded like one his

clothes looked like the effete east and he
wore a cap in lieu of the proper sombrero
of the west

   and over and above all he rode his
hoss at a trot

   yes son he trotted and whenever
eck turner saw a man trot in that country
where the pervadin fashion was nothin but
the lope he choked with wrath

   so now when that hossman that had
the look of a tourist trotted into ecks
sight risin in his stirrups with the motion
of said hoss eck cries to the parties stand-
in nigh on the bod-walk incloodin me
and my pardner alec michlin

   dye see the daylight between that fel-
ler and his saddle seein daylight that-a-
way always does make me wish the rider
was injin or hostile-so that i might use
him as t target

    that there aint no tourist one of the
parties on the bod-walk allowed  hes
the santa fes new engineer of construction
who has recent pitched camp in our midst
while executin orders as to buildin these
yere new bridges both sides of dodge

  all the same sons eck says after the

its a great pity were obleeged to

tolerate a brand like yours
-on this yere range
ten thousand miles by rail



hossman had rode past us  if ever i see
him trottin through this yere main street
again i allow ill send a bullet between him
and his saddle just for to pass the time

   well son i might as well let you savvy
right now that it was that said santa fe
construction engineer that was destinated to
put eck turner out of commission though
deeds miscellaneous was to be performed
by said eck prior thereto which the same
ill recite sos youll learn that ecks pun-
ishment was deserved good and plenty

   early that evenin me and my pardner
alec michlin entered the nose-paint wick-
eyup havin its front on the bod-walk
and there we again met this yere double-l
eck turner he was now in the act of
chewing his mane and tryin evident to
stampede the barkeep which the same jaw-
fest was all of and concernin pay for the
drinks

   says i then to my pardner alec mich-
lin whisperin

    theres going to be a slam-up spread-
eagle of a time round in yere in a minute or
prior thereto ease up both your guns

   eck was sure enough blood - hungry
which he showed by the way he was pes-
terin that barkeep and pervadin round
general on the premises

   it looked like the big ready was due
when sudden my pardner alec michlin
steps up to eck and says

     pardner im just in from the round-
up myself and with the dough whereas
therefore i beg permission for to ask all
the men here present to make it unanimous
in our midst that i be allowed to make this
occasion well and frisky by settlin the bar-
keeps claim against you

  whatever did eck answer well son
eck was old enough to know better-seein
that there was some thirty wrinkles on his
horns-yet he reneges sayin

    eck turner stranger aint feedin
and beddin down in your pasture a whole
lot and hed like to know therefore why-all
he should let you scratch his nose-paint ac-
count off the slate 

  heres why-all says michlin plenty
prompt shoving one of his guns under ecks
nose with one hand and passing the barkeep
the yellow coin with the other

  well son eck was for continuing his
renege even so he began to rap his horns
around a whole lot and was for makin the
big noise when michlin says furthermore

    if you feel that youve pitched camp

in my society by mistake and dont love the
outfit you better just vamose cause this
reservation is likely to get some malarious
for you if youre hankerin for anything that
aint peaceful a whole lot otherwise how-
somever youve got the invite from me to
front up at this yere bar and observe fourth
drink-time proper

  now son eck bein a bad man was
some coward the sudden bushwhackin on
the nigh side of him by my pardner mich-
lin made eck clear his valves and upspeak
without further frills sayin

    the drops  me stranger thats some
gauzy i allow i aint got no objection to
frontin up at this yere bar with you a whole
lot instanter

    the bridles clean plum off to you
pardner now says michlin to eck puttin
his gun back in the front of his chaps
 riot right along up yere to the bar he
continued  barkeep shove over the nose-
paint to the double-l outfit and let him
wet his valves till hes roped by the treemers
-all on me

   eck plenty prompt got free with the
nose-paint finished the bottle and then al-
lowed hed go get his chaps under a table
in the restaurant across the street the said
restaurant was kept by an opium slave
named china jim eck allowed hed go
over and order a suey with chopsticks and
forthwith he evacuates our society

   he hadnt cut us out moren a few min-
utes when sudden we heard shots out in
main street naturally we stampeded out
onto the bod-walk to see what-all the pistol
practise was for

   and what we saw was double-l eck
goin down main street shootin out all the
electric lights

    what-all is he mussin round that-a-
way for 

  my pardner michlin asks that of the
parties from the saloon that had been enjoy-
in his entertainment a whole lot

  reckon the parties answered that
its another of ecks demonstrates of his dis-
like for things i bet the drinks that hes
took a dislike to the sputterin noise made
by those lights bet thats why hes now
shootin the carbons like you see him

   alec michlin and the parties from the
saloon then stepped over to china jims to
ask questions the opium slave told em
that eck had come in and ordered suey and
while waiting cried sudden

    whatever do you allow them lights is
-

the railroad mans magazine

makin them war - cries about  reckon
there aint no safety in their midst ill just
go out and put a stop to those war-cries
china boy while you put the big ready onto
the table

  yes son thats how three whole pas-
ture-lots in dodge got put into darkness
that night by pistol practise performed by
double-l eck

  next mornin eck with the bridle still
plum off was again riotin round on main
street he was cavortin along the bod-
walk with michlin and the parties from the
drink-house when sudden a minister rises
up out of the earth wearin a plug hat
eck puts his lamps on that fellow plenty
prompt and then announces his dislike of
the ministers head-piece

   says he mussin with his gun

    that man is wearin a plug thats a
inch higher than the pervadin fashion ac-
cordin to fifth avenoo i reckon ill take
that inch off that plug just to put the sky-
pilot into fashion

  forthwith eck fired the plug fell
from the divines head onto the bod-walk
of main street dodge

   say whatever do you think the divine
did think he turned thp other cheek
no son he walked right up to eck and
says to him in words to this effect

     its a great pity that we are obleeged
to tolerate a brand like yours on this jere
range its gauzy that you framed it up
sure to get a hoss on me if you dont take
your brand off this range instanter youll
remain illegal and the city marshal will be
ropin at you till youre herded in the corral
with hobbles onto all four of your legs
and after upspeakin thus the divine
-son he was a brave or im a mexican-
kicks his shot-up plug to the very feet of
the stonished eck turner then he turns
his back fearless and proceeds down street
like he was paradin to music of the dead
march

  and that son is the way bad man eck
turner got cowed twice in twenty-four
hours he knowed very well that for him
to make a move of his hand toward his gun
in the presence of us-all as that warlike
divine marched down street would have
meant sure the shinin gates of pearl and
gold for eck turner

   and now lemme tell you what happened
to eck on that memorial day when he
chanced to cast his lamps on a party on a
hoss

   it was that same party that had passed
on the afternoon previous-the santa fe
engineer he was again passin on the trot
which made the whites of ecks eyes go
bloodshot eck pulls one of his guns and
cries to the parties standin nigh

     i said id do it just for to pass the
time well sons i allow i can put a bullet
through that streak of daylight between the
man and the saddle at about his third rise
in the saddle from now

   as he spoke eck took aim careful-and
fired the bullet miraculous sped true
through the streak of daylight and smither-
eened the sign readin  china jim over
the opium slaves place down street diag-
onal

   eck was now lookin for to be rubbed
down with admiration but he changed his
mind somewhat sudden he saw the hoss-
man turn leisurely and come ridin at a
walk toward where he and the witnesses
were standin

   the hossman got so near that eck and
his parties could see the whites of his eyes
then sudden the hossman in a move like
one streak of greased lightning drew and
fired at eck putting a bullet through the
shoulder of his gun-arm

   the hossmans next shot bored a tunnel
through ecks other shoulder then he put
away his gun and addressed the crowd
most of whom was bending over eck where
he had fallen

    gents says the hossman  if im
wanted for this the city marshal will find
me in a tent beside the santa fe tracks just
outside the city

    with that he wheeled his hoss and start-
ed away-at a trot and he trotted out of
sight too before one of them witnesses up-
spoke to say

   if that mans a tenderfoot im one
myself

   who-all is he  asked another of the

witnesses

  and say son after they had carried
eck into the saloon one of the witnesses
went to fetch the doctor while the rest of
the witnesses went skirmishin and bush-
whackin round dodge garnerin knowledge
of and concernin the trotter finally they
were again herded in the saloon whisperin
among themselves which the same whisper-
ins were inclusive of this to wit

    and hes some recent out of harvard
and hes a relationship of general dodge
and he has fronted up against injins and
ten thousand miles by rail

hostiles by whom hes called  wind-in-
the-face cause he never turned his back
on nothin not even a cyclone and his fa-
thers some honorable in the big teepee in
washington and hes a civil engineer in
charge of the work of puttin up all the
santa fes new bridges in kansas and his
names samyule dodge

  eck soons he could move off the sa-
loon reservation without utterin  ouch 
every second moved out of kansas all the
way to frisco where he
opened a sailors bodin-
house and was garnered into
the life everlastin while in
in the act of makin his usual
monotonous win at poker

taking a legal rest

  the rock islands golden
state limited was running
into topeka kansas when
a gray-haired knight of the
grip said

    ever travel local in kan-
sas  

 yes on the limited

oh thats too easy

travel on these line through
trains is all right because
they attend strictly to the
business of going through
kansas to another state but
to meander round kansas on
a local - say thats going
some

   let me tell you of an
experience of mine

   the witching hour was
approaching as my train
crawled up through eastern
kansas toward the nebraska
line and marysville was
still thirteen miles away i
prayed-yes i really offered up fervid
prayer-that the train would reach marys-
ville before the hands of my watch met at
twelve should midnight find the train still
on the prairie outside of marysville i
would find myself in a predicament in
which i had often been before and which
i dreaded

    gan we make it  i asked conductor
bainton my voice full of deep anxiety

     looks pretty blue he answered  its
eleven thirty-five now and between here and
marysville weve got a lot of way freight
to unload

   the train was a mixed passenger and
freight on the lincoln branch of the union
pacific-with one day coach for the passen-
gers of which there were six including my-
self and a rosy-cheeked girl who told us she
was tired of working as  hired girl  on a
farm and was on her way to town to go
take a job in a store the common destina-
tion of all six of us was marysville as
the minutes passed each of us prayed in
his own way that some miracle would hap-

only to find the tail-lights of the west-bound
freight disappearing round a- curve

pen to enable the train to reach town before
midnight

   we stopped put off some freight then
crawled on again till conductor bainton
came into our car with his watch in his
hand and looking mighty serious

  twelve oclock he said its all
over make yourselves as comfortable as
you can the rest of the night if a train
happens to come along any time before
eight to-morrow morning it will pick us up
and carry us into marysville if not we
will lay on the siding onto which we are
now pulling for the rest of the night 


the railroad mans magazine

here i
story-teller

interrupted
to ask why
train stopjjed

  wait a moment he
answered let me tell you
what happened i turned
to the conductor and asked

  hovv far are we now
from marysville 

twelve miles

    you mean to say weve
traveled only one mile in the
last twenty-five minutes 

yes

     if we can find a farm-
house i said  perhaps we
can get -a team into marys-
ville

  come outside said the
conductor

   we all piled out on the prairie and
then the conductor said

     do you see anything that looks like
a human habitation 

   we looked in every direction in search
of a light advertising the presence of a
farmhouse-all in vain

   again i interrupted the old traveler to
ask why the train did not go on

   just a moment my boy he replied
let me tell you what we did then we
six passengers returned to the day coach
and made a bluff at sleeping each of us
stretching out on two seats the sir wal-
ter raleigh aboard threw his overcoat over
the shivering form of the rosy-cheeked girl
of the sunflower state

   meantime the train-crew-every man
from engineer to rear brakeman-went
regularly and comfortably to bed in the ca-
boose and doubtless all slept like babes

  until eight oclock the next
  morning

   for the third time i in-
  terrupted with the query as to
  why the train stood still

   wait a minute the old
  traveler answered let me
  tell you the story at day-
  light - about five oclock-x
  awoke the passengers saying
  friends i see a big
  smoke over yonder that
  means a human habitation
  and perhaps a horse and
  wagon we all want to do a
  long days work in marys-
  ville if you wish to get there
  before noon come with me

     out of the train we filed
  and trudged across the
  prairie toward the big smoke
  and found a farmhouse we
  chipped in then-all save the 
  girl - and raised sufficient
  money to pay the farmer for
  driving us into marysville
  we arrived there before eight
  oclock or in other words
  while our train was still
  standing on the siding twelve
  miles away and to tell you
  the sequel die train did not
  pull into marysville till
  noon

    well thats local rail-
  roading in kansas what do
  you think of it

   im still waiting i answered for you
to tell me why the train did not proceed to
marysville

  the law my boy trainmen in this
state are protected by law against having
to work more than sixteen hours at a stretch
now that train-crew had been on duty since
eight oclock in the morning when mid-
night came they had been working sixteen
hours and die law says that a train-crew
after working sixteen hours must rest at
least eight hours thats why the train
dared not move off that siding till eight in
the morning

presence of mind

  the breckenridge family consisting of
the  grand old man  and two clever daugh-
ters held the distinction of being the only
family in kansas having all of its members

is this engine as easy to
master as a wild cayuse  
ten thousand

miles by rail



employed simultaneously by one railroad a
telegraphers

  this is how the two girls were shifted
from night duty to day duty

  when nora breckenridge night oper-
ator came on duty one evening at the rock
island station at arlington kansas a
howling north wind shook the frail build-
ing the first thing nora did was to call
up her father who was day operator at
langdon the next station west

   you better go home at once father
were the words nora sent over the wire
theres going to be a gale to-night

  just then one of the rock islands night
operators at kansas city cut in to ask

   hows father  

  it was noras sister kate

  father hasnt slept well for several
nights nora answered  he worries
about our being on night-work imagines
it impairs our health and says the railroad
must give us day jobs

  tell him to go to bed and forget it
was the advice of the elder daughter flashed
over the wire from kansas city

  nora immediately called up her father
and told him what her sister had said-
 forget it

   i will go to bed now answered mr
breckenridge but all the same i mean
to make the rock island give my two girls
day turns

  on the night in question three hours
after her chat with her sister in kansas
city and with her father at langdon the
wind sweeping past noras station at ar-
lington had increased to a gale it was now
eleven oclock shrieking and whistling
and traveling at almost cyclonic pace gusts
from the north threatened to tear the sta-
tion building from its foundation nora
quite unafraid peered through her rattling
window and watched a west-bound freight
roll by

  just then too her sounder began click-
ing and to her consternation nora heard
the despatcher order her to flag the west-
bound freight and hold it at her station un-
til the east-bound freight which had just
cleared from turon two stations away
had passed

  nora leaped to the door and out into the
gale of wind-only to find the tail-lights of
the west-bound freight disappearing round
a curve

  then back to her key she bounded and
called up langdon between her own depot

and turon langdon was not a night of-
fice but nora called frantically in the hope
that after all her father had not gone home
to forget it

  no answer came nora abandoned hope
of having the freight flagged and sent back
from there

  the excited girl then turned to the tele-
phone and called up her fathers house in
langdon persistent ringing however
failed to arouse mr breckenridge it was
only too plain that he had gone to bed and
 forgotten it

  nora hung up and began pacing the floor
in anguish bringing her fist down into
the palm of her hand she murmured
those trains must not meet yet how
can i avert it  

  after a moments thought the resourceful
operator hit upon a plan out into the gale
and up the road she rushed toward the cen-
tral telephone office as she had not
stopped for hat or wrap the wind tore the
hairpins from her hair and as she said
afterward the wind nearly blew my hair
off too

  rounding into the presence of the night
hello girl nora hurriedly explained the
situation then asked

  who can we call up between here and
langdon it must be some one living close
to the railrodd track

  the  hello girl  ran her finger down the
list of subscribers

  mr spence she cried- theres the
man hes a farmer living four miles
down close to the track

  she began calling farmer spence per-
sisting till some one answered

  nora herself then cried into the hello
girls mouthpiece

   hallo mr spence get a lantern
wrap a red cloth around it go out to the
railroad track and wait there till a west-
bound freight pulls into sight then wave
your lantern when the train stops tell
the engineer to back to arlington at full
speed dont waste a second mr spence
fifteen minutes later nora standin on
her station platform braving the gale gave
a shout of joy as she beheld the tail-lights
of the west-bound freight as the train backed
round the curve when the caboose reached
the station nora shouted to conductor
booth who stood on the rear platform
onto the siding quick the east-
bound freight is due here now

  a few minutes later the east-bound


the railroad mans magazine

freight rumbled past arlington station
conductor booth of the west-bound en-
tered that station and said to nora

  so you let us get by without flagging
us did you

  im not saying who let you get by but
it was not i nora answered

  ah i see somebody in the des-
patchers office at hutchinson sent you the
order too late was that it

   yes

  well miss breckenridge some one will
get demoted and some one promoted for this
and the one to be demoted wont be you
one evening in the following week when
nora came on duty her sister in kansas
city called her up saying

   i hear you are to be given a day turn
i suppose it is your reward for saving the
freights from meeting on the night of the
gale tell father

  nora called up langdon station and told
her father what she had just heard from
her sister

   revvard  clicked mr breckenridge
 reward has nothing to do with it youve
been given a day job because i informed
the rock island that the whole brecken-
ridge family would walk out unless you girls
were given daylight work theyve fixed
you up first nora kate will get a day
turn too this week the railkiad cant do
without the b reckon ridge family and so
theyre making peace with us at any price

tried to  bust  a locomotive

  when engineer cy crosman brought his
freight-train to a standstill in the santa
fe yard at wichita kansas he saw a tall
young man looking up into the cab wist-
fully

  the tall man wore cow-punchers boots
and spurs also a cow-punchers sombrero

   i say friend the wistful-eyed said
addressing the engineer  is this here engine
as easy to master as a wild cayuse 

   surest thing you know replied cros-
man who having received a brakemans
signal now opened the throttle and pulled
the engine away from the train and over to
another track when he again stopped
there stood the tall one peering wistfully
into the cab as before for the tall one
had run along beside the engine after the
uncoupling from the train

  what you going to do now the tall
one asked

  load chuck at the hashery answered
the engineer

  my names herb west said the wist-
ful-eyed man  imfrom texas occupa-
tion bronco-buster

   come over to the hash-joint and tell
me all about it said crosman

  ive already loaded thanks ill stay
here you say a big engine like this is as
easy to bust as a cayuse do you well
id like to try it just once

  join the brothechood get a card and
then try it all you like said crosman

  the engineer and his fireman hurried
over to the hashery where they found the
other members of the crew two brakemen
and a conductor

  while all five were consuming the pie
that concluded the supper one of the brake-
men suddenly jumped up and sprang to the
door crying

   some ones moving your engine cy
why he added its that chap wearing
the boots and spurs

   surest thing you know responded cy
crosman who had also left the table and
was now looking out of the window  hes
running away with my engine the nerve
of him come on you fellows lets take
old doc shermans engine and chase this
locomotive stealer

  men were running excitedly through the
freight-vard now shouting the news that
some one was running off with cy cros-
mans engine like wildfire the news
spread till the operators at the passen-
ger-station heard it and at once wired all
stations within ten miles northward-the
direction in which the cow-puncher was
running the stolen engine

  five miles to the north the wichita ope-
rator found a passenger-train he ordered
it side-tracked ten miles north at center
valley he found a freight-train he or--
dered it side-tracked

  meantime cy crosman and his fireman
with the two brakemen and the conductor
boarded doc shermans engine and started
in pursuit as he flew through the yard
crosman leaned out of his cab window and
yelled to a yardman

   go tell the operator at the station to
wire up to center valley for the operator
there to open the derail-switch there
he added turning to the four men in the
cab  if we dont catch him this side of
center valley hell be ditched when he hits
that derail
ten thousand miles by rail



  out of the yard the pursuing engine sped
and soon came within sight of the stolen
engine a mile ahead

   he said hed like to try to bust an en-
gine just once grosman shouted but
hang it i dont want him to bust my en-
gine and he will bust it all right if he
hits that derail-switch weve simply got to

  leaping like cats onto the tender of the
fugitive engine the two brakemen then
clambered over the coal and out of gros-
mans sight next second the whistle of
the forward engine signaled to come to a
stop

  an hour later both engines backed into
the freight-yard at wichita-with herb

and a few other things besides i guess

overtake him before he gets to center
valley

   but how you going to stop him   shout-
ed the conductor as the locomotive tore on

  watch me answered crosman ill
stop him surest thing you know

  mile after mile the chase continued the
pursuing engine gradually drawing nearer
and nearer the fugitive when nine miles
had been run crosmans engine was within
a hundred feet of the runaway

   now he yelled  you fellows get
read- to climb over the tender of that en-
gine the moment i overtake him

  two minutes later the two engines came
together crosmans machine now literally
pushing the fugitive ahead just as they tore
into center valley

  now shouted the engineer you
two brakemen climb over that tender like
you were hold-up men and jump down into
the cab and overpower that cow-puncher
hurry the derail-switch is just ahead
 rr

west bronco-buster of texas a prisoner

  what ailed you anyhow asked cros-
man as he handed the prisoner to a con-
stable  drunk  

  sober as a judge replied the texan
all the worse for you retorted cros-
man  youll spend a few months in jail
for stealing my engine

  its worth it said the tall one i
wanted to bust a locomotive-just for the
fun of telling the boys at home all about it
simply couldnt resist the chance gee
but i sure have got a hoss on the boys down
on the ranch

train vs cyclone 

  a burlington passenger-train with nat
joyce at the throttle was rolling westward
on the run between lincoln and platts-
mouth nebraska at the particular mo-
ment when engineer joyce happened to
look backward at the sky his train was


the railroad mans magazine

sauntering at the rate of about fifteen miles
an hour

   we must hump ourselves  he cried

  he spoke somewhat excitedly and
pushed over the throttle so that the train
gave a sudden leap forward

   whats ailin you   asked the fireman

   how fast do you suppose that cyclone
is traveling the engineer asked nodding
his head backward and indicating that the
fireman was to take a look

   it sure enough is a cyclone said the
fireman after a hasty glance at the black
sky

  the train leaped on gradually attaining
a speed of thirty miles then forty then
fifty

  taint enough shouted engineer
looking backward its gaining on us
give her more fuel 

  the fireman thrust coal into the fire-hox
at the rate of almost sixty shovelfuls a
minute the train rocked and careened
like a ship on a stormy sea five miles
were covered across the nebraska prairie-
five miles from the point at which the race
with the cyclone had begun

   and weve five miles more to go before
we reach that sharp curve to the southward
just this side of plattsmouth  cried joyce
 unless we make that curve in time were
goners

  faster and faster the fireman heaved
coal greater and greater grew the speed of
the train till now in the sixth mile of the
race the were speeding at the rate of near-
ly sixty an hour

  taint enough still insisted joyce
 remember that the curve is the only thing
that can save us look the tornado is
gaining on us

  by the time the seventh mile had been
covered the train was going at a pace a lit-
tle in excess of sixty miles and the cyclone
had drawn so close that one of the advance
heralds of wind snatched joyces cap and
carried it away the day had become al-
most as dark as night

   weve got to make that curve within
two minutes yelled joyce fire up
some more 

  the fireman working like a trojan and

sweating like a turkish-bath rubber yelled
in answer

   if you want her to have more coal come
feed her yourself cause im doing my
limit

   in the eighth mile of the race the cyclone
seemed to be less than two miles behind the
train in the ninth mile engineer joyce
looked back and saw a farmhouse collapse
like a thing of cards

   in the tenth mile the train was flying at
the rate of seventy miles an hour then
came the curve joyce wondered whether
he dared sweep around that curve at such
speed

    its the curve at this pace or get blown
from the track he told himself

   for now the pursuing cyclone was all
but upon them

  round the curve the train swung as
joyce said afterward on its side then
on down the track southward all this in
the nick of time

   joyce and the fireman glancing back
saw something sail through the air over the
curve it was the roof of the near-by sec-
tion-house

   a number of the terror-stricken passen-
gers in the coaches behind had been kneel-
ing in prayer led by a minister from lin-
coln all during the last half of the ten-
mile race they knelt thus some of them be-
lieving that death was upon them

   then the train stopped

   joyce seeing that the danger was over
pulled up to discover just what tendons and
muscles had been strained in the mad race

   while nat joyce thus critically examined
the iron horse of which he was now so
proud the minister from lincoln came to
the engineers side and with beaming face
said it was a most wondrous example of
the efficacy of prayer

   efficacy answered nat joyce with
a very respectful grunt  and a few other
tilings besides i guess

    bill he suddenly added turning to
the panting fireman who had thrown him-
self on a bed of dandelions beside the track
 i thought you was a human derrick but
youre not our friend the parson says
youre an efficacy

      the thousand-and-one nights tales of the early days
      of railroading when many queer things happened

chapter xi

        the stranger in the cab

jsfjpt is ten years ago since that little

   ii affair happened near know-
  lings bridge i was running

i l no  the road was in splen-

        	did condition my engine had
just come out of the shop
thoroughly repaired and altogether every-
thing looked pleasant

   it was on a sunday morning i had
backed- down from the roundhouse to the
station at valley junction coupled on to
my train and was waiting for the passen-
gers to finish their breakfast

   my wife had brought the children down
to the depot as was her custom every sun-
day morning and i was playing with them
on the platform while the passengers came
hurrying out one by one i was just giving
one of my youngsters a parting hug when
all of a sudden i saw a strange man jump
stealthily but quickly on the engine and pull
the throttle

   my fireman was not on the engine at
the time

  the wheels creaked the train moved
and the loiterers on the platform jumped
hurriedly on board quick as a flash i
placed the child in its mothers arms in
another instant i was face to face with the
intruder

   a single look told me that he meant
mischief he was a man of herculean
stature bareheaded and scantily attired
with glaring eyes and long hair his sleeves
were rolled up above his elbows displaying
brawny muscular arms

with a wild excited laugh he pulled

began in the february railroad mans



the bell-rope violently apparently taking
but little notice of my presence

    what are you doing are you crazy 
i cried as i grappled with him

   he looked at me witli that same leer
pushing qie back as if i were a feather he
said abstractedly

  dont annoy me now i beg of you
im busy

   i summoned all my strength and rushed
at him again bv this time the train was
well in motion its speed was momentarily
increasing

    he let go of the bell-rope as i seized
him by the arms he grasped mine in turn
holding me in a viselike grip he looked
me full in thp face

    didnt i tell you that i didnt wish
to be annoyed 

   i glanced keenly into his face as he
spoke for the first time the horrible trutli
broke in upon me-the man was crazy

  a shudder ran through my veins i
realized the dreadful danger before me i
thought of my little children whose kisses
were yet warm upon my face and of that
long train behind us full of passengers so
little suspecting their peril

   quietly seating me  the firemans
seat he loosened his hold and returned to
his post saying

  there now i dont want to be
bothered 

   by this time we were dashing along at
a pretty rapid rate and i could see that he
knew how to handle an engine

   i jumped to my feet a third time he
leaned forward to reach the throttle-lever

  stop her i exclaimed who are
you  

  me he answered with a quiet

magazine single copies  ccnts


the railroad mans magazine

laugh  im a practical engineer working
in the interests of science ive studied for
years and now i want to makean experi-
ment dont interrupt me 

   he gave me another look full of wild
determination and then burst into hilarious
laughter

     good  he cried  but shell do bet-
ter by and by now-she flies 

   he gave the throttle-lever another jerk
the engine shot ahead

   for a moment i sank in utter despair
to measure strength with such a man was
suicidal a struggle would only result in
my destruction and the probable destruc-
tion of the train and all on board

  one possible chance of regaining con-
trol of the engine presented itself i must
draw him into conversation and watch for
my opportunity to gain advantage either
of his credulity or his vanity sufficiently to
induce him to give me his place

   i scanned him closer than ever he
seemed to have entirely forgotten my pres-
ence now jumping up laughing and clap-
ping his hands now letting more steam
on now looking eagerly out ahead and
murmuring  better better better still 

   my heart was thumping against my
chest as i said

     you seem to understand your business
pretty well been long at it 

   he looked at me looked away again
but did not answer

     i see you are a good practical engi-
neer as you say i continued  how long
have you been at the business 

     years i tell you  he answered  it
was i who fitted out pegasus the winged
steed 

     i wish i had your experience i said

 what a team wed make in the cause of
science eh  

   an expression of unspeakable delight
illumined his face he turned toward me
and said

    are you for science too 

     science every inch of me  i replied
  give me your hand  he shook mine
with a fervor which sent a tingle to my
very collar-bone  hurrah for science
youre the man ive been searching for
with a lantern these thousand years you
can help me but and he leaned over and
whispered in my ear so distinctly that i
could hear every word above the racket

 can you keep a secret 

     certainly i replied

    a creeping horror stole over me i felt
his hot breath upon my face

     you swear you can   he continued
looking inquiringly at me

      i swear  i said desperately

     because he hissed  if i thought you
meant to betray me id tear your tongue
out 

     never fear one man of science betray-
ing another i answered with a sickly at-
tempt at bravery  im your man 

     well then mind what i say he con-
tinued apparently reassured

   he took from his pocket a bunch of
soiled papers scrawled all over with lead-
pencil marks

     heres my secret the result of five
hundred years hard studv to you as a
friend of science i will tell it but remem-
ber your promise

     now you see he went on to say  a
tangent from a parabolic curve goes on to
infinity and he held up one of the soiled
scrawls before me pointing out the marks
upon it with his long crawlike forefinger 
and infinity is what do you know
no but you shall do i know yes
and in the cause of science i am going to
show you speed in locomotion tends to-
ward infinity infinity is unknown the
higher the speed consequently the greater
proximity to the unknown

    down where ive been studying they
wouldnt let me build my engine to make
this experiment so and here his voice fell
to a horrid whisper again  i came away
secretly the other night and now-ha ha
ha-ive an engine of my own speed
speed speed is what we want by and by
well be ready for the tangent then infin-
ity and then our fortune is made forever 
 i saw that hope was fast disappearing
his intention plainly was to put the engine
to her highest speed and send us whizzing
over an embankment at the first short curve
we had gone nine miles already although
only thirteen minutes had elapsed since we
left valley junction i nerved myself for a
final effort

      come said i  your secret is wonder-
ful now that i know it i will give you
all my help to carry out youj-plan but
you have overlooked one important point
the tangent which will quickest bring us
to what we are after must be directed from
a point as near as possible to the base of
the cone that point we cannot discern
unless you with your superior insight into
vanishing railroaders



the principle will take a position on the
outside of the engine and give me the sig-
nal when to send her off 

   the idea seemed to strike him
good he exclaimed shaking my
hand  dont take your eyes off me 

     that i shant i said fervently as he
opened the window and made a movement
as if to step on the running-board

  my heart beat with anticipation once
outside he would be at- my mercy long
enough for me to whistle down brakes shut
off steam and reverse the engine

  suddenly he turned slamming the win-
dow glaring at me like a demon he
hissed

     youve betrayed me what did i tell
you 

     come come i said  i havent go
ahead see theres the curve just ahead
hurry be quick or the chance is gone 
i say youve betrayed me and im
going to kill you i heard you whisper
my secret a moment ago 

   he came toward me with frenzy and
savage cruelty

    now i thought  one last struggle for
life or death 

  mustering all my force i struck him
with my clenched fist

   he came at me viciously i felt his
long bony hands in my hair i staggered
and fell backward my head struck against
something hard my eyes grew dim and i
lay insensible

   it was possibly half an hour before i
regained consciousness the first object
that met my view in the distant landscape
was the white steeple of a church i was
lying on my side between the engine and
tender with my head half over the edge

   weak and exhausted from loss of blood
my eyes wandered to where the madman
was still standing i saw him with height-
ened wildness on his countenance his long
hair floating in the wind glancing eagerly
out ahead his lips muttering incoherent and
meaningless words now and then he would
clap his hands in fiendish joy then settle
quietly down again to his sullen mutterings

   the rate of speed at which we were
moving did not seem to have abated it
was evident that he had replenished the fire
while i was lying unconscious i feared
every instant the crash that would send me
madman engine everything whirling to
perdition

   as my faculties grew stronger i began

to realize the horror of my situation what
if he should discover my signs of returning
life he would throw me from the train

or dash my brains out

  where was the conductor perhaps he
had been left behind the brakeman-

could not some of them come to rescue me
had not our wild speed our neglect of the
usual stoppages told those on the train that
something was certainly wrong

   suddenly i remembered that we were
rapidly approaching knowlings bridge
which spanned the awful chasm through
which the arrow river leaps and plunges

   in my pocket was a telegraphic order
from the division superintendent stating
that the west-bound track on the bridge
would that morning le taken up for re-
pairs and directing all trains to stop for
the switch on approaching and cross on the
east-bound track

  the horror of the impending disaster
welled before me should this maniac per-
sist in his mad purpose only ten minutes
longer-it would be the end

   i heard a cry of wild joy from my com-
panion gliding like lightning around a
curve the valley and the massive bridge
were first disclosed to his view

  now now he shouted here we
are at last science and infinity and all
the unknown are mine forever 

   i tried to move a pang of agony shot
through every nerve and muscle in my body
i sunk again in utter despair closed my
eyes and waited for death

  crack crack a scream a shout

   i opened my eyes once more the mad-
man had fallen upon his knees with the
expression of a demon his bared arms
stretched above his head his powerful form
writhing his eyes protruding from their
sockets and foam on his lips he began to
mutter something i could not understand
then i noticed blood trickling down his
breast

   i saw the monster weak and wounded
as he was turn and crawl upon his knees
toward me

   come come  i screamed bv that
time his clutches were upon my throat i
looked upward to the clear blue morning
sky above us to feel my breath coming
slower and slower

  the coarse talonlike grip relaxed of a
sudden the din grew less and less and the
welcome shriek of the whistle for down
brakes sounded in my ears


the railroad mans magazine

   i felt myself lifted like a child in two
pairs of friendly arms  heard sobs and
shouts of joy and the movement of many
feet around me

  a voice whispered lovingly in my ear

the man in the front seat

the woman who sat by me was elderly

      with a sharp but somewhat handsome
face worn and marked with time and
trouble	v

  a man followed her into the car he
found a seat before us in a short while
he turned to my seat-mate

  he is really your husband you know
mrs eve ns he said in a low voice

  he is not she replied with emphasis
 i beg you not to be hasty continued
the man persuasively  i do not pretend
he did right in leaving you and his child
for so many years without a word his
second marriage is more inexcusable yet
but this second mrs evans has been worse
treated than you have if she will over-
look her wrongs and permit him to leave
her for you without making any trouble
it seems to me you may find it possible to
forgive him for the sake of your boy
for the sake of my boy mrs evans
said passionately  a great gift such a
father would be i tell you mr mayne
every drop of blood in my body flies into
motion thinking of such cowardly mean-
ness and terrible wrong you may be per-
fectly sure that i will never even see him
this is my final answer

  the woman seemed to be doubly deter-
mined i wondered at the mans hardihood
in persisting further finally he turned
still more in his seat as if he had not de-
cided to accept her words as final

  all thi time the man who occupied the
seat before me with mr mayne was sitting
close to the window with his hat over his
eyes apparently asleep however i clearly
detected that he was listening

  mr mayne and mrs evans were both
too absorbed to notice him

   but mrs evans began mr mayne
again your husband is very penitent
ready to make any promises you may re-
quire and willing to submit to any condi-
tions if you will only acknowledge him as
vour husband

   although he has showed lamentable
weakness in neglecting to send for you i
believe he was never really base at heart or
intentionally a scoundrel he kept hoping
his business affairs would brighten and he
was ashamed and discouraged about letting
you know of his failures

  mr mayne i have no husband he
was lost to me twenty-one years ago i
have no intention of seeing or hearing any-
thing more about the creature who bears
his name said mrs evans coldly

  we halted a moment as we neared the
next station and she passed into the next
car i never saw her again

  she was scarcely gone when a voice came
from the silent man

  mayne are you going to let her go
it said in wo and despair

   i can do nothing with her evans i
told you so before you have heard her
talk for herself arent you satisfied
you wont desert me now mayne i
dont care so much for her but i want my
boy said the voice pathetically

   i can do nothing more for you you
hear what she says he added

   then why did you tell me at the start
she had left new york with my boy and
say you would intercede for me i paid
you because you declared that you knew
my wife would return to me and that any-
how i could get my boy

   business is business returned mr
mayne  i must live as well as the next
man and you cannot say but the bargain
was fairly made and the money fairly
earned

   i bought off my second wife to return
to my first-as you suggested you said it
could easily be accomplished 

   it is a pity about you but i can do
nothing more i have fulfilled my promise
the man seemed already too wretched to
mind this cold-hlooded thrust he only
crushed his hat lower on his forehead and
settled back in his seat the image of for-
saken and hopeless desolation so we
whirled along past sleeping villages and
over long reaches of open country

  suddenly he jumped to his feet and grap-
pled mr mayne by the neck before that
person was aware of what was happening
two powerful thumbs were being forced into
his throat

  before the other passengers were able to
tear his antagonist from him mr mavnes
life had ebbed away
vanishing railroaders



  the train was stopped at the next sta-
tion and the murderer was turned over to
the police all of the passengers were lined
up in the station and asked if there were
any in the number who could identify him

  a woman paled and pressed her hand to
her heart before she fell in a faint she
managed to shout

   my husband 

  the woman was mrs evans

chapter xiii
the mystery of the key

ont fret mag for the short time i
shall be away i said to my wife
as i put on my gloves and coat

   couldnt you stay at homejust this one
night jim do you know i felt so lonely
and strange last night when you were away
and to-night i can scarcely bear the thought
of your being absent so long 	

  she looked up to my face with an anxious
gaze tears glistened in the corners of her
sweet blue eyes

  why you little goose said i kissing
away the bright tokens of her earnestness
why should you feel alarmed i must
go every night to see that everything is
ok on the line i shall be at home by
seven at the latest if you are really afraid
to stay in the house alone i will send my
brother tom to keep you company

  no dont do that it would look fool-
ish and tom would only laugh at me when
he came he does not understand me i
think no one understands me-except you
dear

   thank you mag i think i under-
stand you there is nothing to fear the
whole village is ready to come at your call
good-by-and dont fret

  i was off but my wife lingered by the
porch so long as the house wras in sight
i could look back and see her white dress
shimmering ghostlike in the light which
streamed through the open door

  i was telegraph superintendent of the
x y and z the trains were run en-
tirely by telegraph our despatcher having
been taken suddenly ill we had put a skil-
ful operator in his place who sometimes
yielded to a desire for drink

i thought it best therefore to be near
at hand in case anything should go wrong

i had been married but a few months and
was by no means reconciled to the neces-

sity of leaving my wife home to pass the
night in that nasty old box as mag
sometimes called my office

  a short ride brought me to my post
there was nothing extraordinary in the
duty to which i had been called away nor
was it a new experience to me but  that
night my mind was filled with vague fears
for which i tried in vain to account

  the night was clear there was a strange
light in die northern sky on entering the
office the night operator whom i had come
to relieve was ready to depart

   no use for two of us to-night he said
 a foreign current has possession of the
instruments and not an office has  called 
for the last hour good night 

  when i was left alone i found it was
as he had said the electric currents which
are developed in the atmosphere during
most meteorological changes had rendered
the wires quite useless for the time seeing
that my office was likely to be a sinecure i
drew my chair to the stove and picking up
a magazine tried to interest myself in the
story suddenly i was startled by the sharp
quick click of one of my sounders as if
some one was attempting to call me with
a shiver of alarm i turned quickly to the
adjustment but soon perceived that the dot
and dash had been sounded by current of
atmospheric electricity

  smiling at the nervousness which caused
me to start at so ordinary an occurrence i
turned from my desk and again sat down
by the stove but smile as i would and
reason as i might i felt that i was fast
succumbing to vague fears thinking that
the atmosphere of the room which seemed
close and hot might have something to do
with my peculiar condition of mind i tlung
open the door and stepped outside into the
cool air

  as i crossed the threshold the midnight
express dashed by with a speed that shook
every timber of the building and disap-
peared into the tunnel at the summit

  i could hear it rumbling on then all
was quiet again save for the peculiar sigh-
ing of the air through the telegraph wires

   i stood and listened to the strange mel-
ancholy sound now so faint as to be almost
inaudible then swelling like a wail

  as a general rule i had a most profound
disbelief in superstition tfcit notwithstand-
ing i felt that i would have given a good
deal to be transported just for one moment
to my home to see if all was well there


the railroad mans magazine

  the express had passed and it was not
probable that any orders would be sent or
received i might telephone to connors
my assistant who lodged near by but as 
could give no good reason for going away

i resolved to stay there and get through
the night as best i could

  j went inside again and poked up the
coals with rather more noise and vigor than
was necessary i lit my pipe as the
wreaths curled upward i saw my wifes
face looking at me as tearfully as when
i had left her

  again one of the instruments clicked
sharply but as before with no intelligible
sound i leaned my elbows on the desk
and with head between my hands watched
the armature as a cat watches a mouse

  again i was startled by the instruments
nervous clicking this time it was louder
and more urgent in short it seemed to be
calling me home i am utterly unable to
tell in what manner the impression was
produced but it seemed as if there mingled
with the metallic click the voice of one i
knew

  the armature began to move more regu-
larly now and to make sounds that my
practised ear understood

  slowly came two dots a space and a
dot as if some novice were working the
instrument and then the word  c-o-m-e 
was signaled

  no sooner had i read off the final e
than to my amazement and terror i saw
the key move as if touched by some invisi-
ble hand and the signal  ok  was made

  a cold thrill ran through me could i
have been the subject of an optical delu-
sion i know that such was not the case
for i had plainly heard the sounder and
saw the armature move in obedience to the
current that made the sound

  i could perceive now that another word
was being slowly spelled

  i was so bewildered and terrified that
i failed to catch the- sounds i watched
the lever intently this time i read
 h-o-m-e

  i stood petrified with fear and amaze-
ment half believing that i was in a dream
could that be a message for me if so
what hand had sent it

  the instrument sounded again after a
few uncertain movements  come home
come home reached my practised ear with
unerring distinctness

  i could remain at my post no longer

come what might i felt that i had no
alternative but to obey

  i ran to the house where my assistant
lived roused the inmates and told him that
he must take my place immediately as i
had been called away suddenly

  connors seemed somewhat surprised at
my excited and startled manner what he
said or did i cannot recollect

  i rushed to thebarn where a horse was
stalled and noticing a saddle hanging on
the wall threw it on his back

  in another moment i was dashing along
the road in the direction of home al-
though i urged my horse lustily his pace
was far too slow for my excited mind

  at length breathless and panting we
clattered up the main street of the village
in which i lived

  suddenly a horse and rider appeared at
the other end of the street a hoarse voice
uttered a loud cry of fire

   at the same instant the church bell was
rung violently as if by magic the village
started into life lights appeared in the
houses and a hundred windows were
opened i heard nervous voices cry from
the windows where

   checking my horse with a jerk i listened
for the reply

chapter jxiv

in a dream

vty worst fears were realized it was
       my own home

  i choked down my agony and pressing
onward with redoubled speed soon arrived
at the scene of the fire

  when i reached home smoke was issuing
in thick murky volumes from the windows
while fierce tongues of flame were leaping
along the roof

   a crowd of men were hurrying confusedly
hither and yon trying to extinguish the
flames

  my wife i exclaimed as i rushed
forward where is she

  heaven knows sir said one of the
men  we have tried twice to reach her
room each time we were driven back by
the smoke and fire 

  i dashed into the house and ran along
the hall the stairs fortunately were built
of stone but the woodwork on each side was
blazing

before i had taken three steps i fell


vanishing railroaders



back blinded fainting and half suffo-
cated with smoke two men who had fol-
lowed me caught me and tried to restrain
me-from endeavoring to ascend again

  dont attempt it they said you
will only lose your own life 

   let go you cowards  i cried

  with the strength of madness i dashed
them aside i rushed up-stairs and suc-
ceeding in reaching the first landing in
safety the bedroom was at the rear on
this floor groping my way through the
smoke i found the door

  to my horror it was locked

  i dashed myself against it again and
again but it resisted all my efforts

  to return as i had come was impossible
the only hope of saving even my own life
was to go forward i kicked the door des-
perately until one of the panels gave in
i crept through the opening but the smoke
was so thick that i could distinguish
nothing

   maggie maggie  i shrieked

  she did not answer

  i groped around in the darkness until
my foot struck something stretched on
the floor i found the apparently lifeless
form of my wife

  i bent over her she was still breathing
i carried her to the window which i broke
open men raised a ladder and stronger
arms than mine bore my wife to safety

  on the evening of the next day i was
thinking over these strange events mag-
gie drew a little stool close beside me i
had not mentioned a word to anybody about
the warning which i had so mysteriously
received when asked what caused me to
return so opportunely i made an evasive
answer

  who would believe such a story
thought i

   jim said the soft low voice of my
wife  if you had not come home-

  hush dont talk like that i cant
bear even to think of it i replied

  she paused for a moment then said

  jim i had such a strange dream last

night you remember the evening you took
me into the telegraph office and told me all
about the batteries and magnets and elec-
tricity  

    perfectly

   and do you remember how i wanted
to send a message with my own hands and
you threw the instruments into what you
called short circuit

  yes

   you made me take hold of the key
and then you guided it while i sent a mes-
sage to your brother who was in the office
at stoughton and the end of it was  come
home come home  which i repeated over
and over until i could do it without your
help

  i turned quickly around she v azing
intently at the fire and did not perceive
the startled look i gave her

  well she continued last night i
could not sleep when i first went to bed
when i did sleep i dreamed i was in your
office again i had hurried there because
i was afraid of something like a demon that
was chasing me i thought nobody could
save me but you and you were not there
i seized the key and wrote the words come
home come home  as you had taught me

  when you did not come i felt the de-
mons hot breath on my cheek as if it were
just going to clutch me in its dreadful
arms and i screamed so loud that i awoke

   the room was dark and filled with
smoke when i jumped up i fainted

  just what made me-rush to her that
night i cannot tell just what made the
instrument click  come home will al-
ways be a mystery

  as i have said boys i do not believe in
superstition or spooks or anything super-
natural railroad men are too practical 
am sure to believe in such things i be-
lieve that the instrument as clicking be-
cause it was affected by an electrical storm
and i only imagined it was sounding  come
home at least i will always say so and
claim nothing more imagination does some
wonderful things at times

       fresh water from our readers keeps the feed
       water in our think tank from getting too hot

if by any chance you should have missed j e
smiths  observations of a country station
agent  in this number-and we dont think we
have a reader so foolish as to let any one of mr
smiths contributions go by-turn back and read
it if you have read it perhaps a second perusal
will not be amiss we have had some experiences
with cats in our wild career but we think this
is about the best cat story that ever came our
way it is the best because the cat figures so
intimately with the railroad in the may num-
ber mr smith has a story just as funny about-a
dog and we want to say right here that it isnt
all easy running when the freight department tries
to put an ordinary canine on the way-bill

  this april number also contains the first half
of an extremely interesting article  the first
fight for a railway the attempt of the lawyer
who tried to prove that an engine could not help
slipping back by multiplying the revolutions of
the driving-wheel by the strokes of the piston
reminds us of the old story but one that will
stand repeating

  in a michigan town a saw-mill hand tried to
run a locomotive into the roundhouse he got it
in too far then reversed and backed outside
then he ran her inside again and again backed
out he kept this up so many times that the
foreman finally said 

   when you get her in why dont you keep
her there

   i will replied the gent of the saw-mill
 if you will only close the door

  the second instalment of  the first fight for
a railway shows further the ludicrous efforts
that were made to prevent the establishment of
the railroad it does not seem possible that
human beings could have lived and worked so
hard putting obstacles in the way of what has
since proved to be the most remarkable innova-
tion of the century these articles show how
active man has been in thwarting the worlds
greatest possibilities that some one else might be
benefited

  in the may number we will have another paper
by john c thomson on  the a b c of freight
rates several graphic and thrilling narratives
of trains that have raced against death and
another article dealing with some of the queerest
happenings ever known to railroad men also
walter gardner seaver whose roundhouse tales
have brought us so much merriment will begin

the first of three papers  the railroad builders
these are intimate stories of the first men who
built our western roads and in them we expect
many an old-timer will recognize friends of for-
mer days men who worked with them sharing
some of the hardest as well as the jolliest days
of their lives

  r m west will contribute another frontier
story it is a graphic account of one of the sol-
diers of old troop m which saw so much duty
forty years ago who was captured by the chey-
ennes

  the recent hold-up of the overland limited
in utah has been thoroughly investigated and
will be added to our well-known series  great
american train robberies

  the fiction is up to the highest point in the
gage there will a bunch of stories of the sort that
you are accustomed to look for in the railroad
mans magazine some of the stories are the
strong gripping narratives of real men others
are instilled with deep human emotion and others
contain that rarest of all fiction elements-humor

  our old friends honk and horace will tell of
their triumphal return to valhalla j r staf-
ford will contribute a new story entitled  comp-
tons train robbery e w cooleys when
grimm got busy and macduffie martins  mo-
raneys mule are on the schedule

  we are printing in this number of the carpet
a few of the letters that have come to us since
the last issue went to press we wish that it were
possible to give space to every letter that comes
to his office because nearly every one contains
something of interest to railroaders the space
is limited however and we can only select a few
but we wish all our readers to know that nothing
pleases us so much as to hear from them
whether it is a brickbat or a bouquet a rose or
a thorn-let us hear from you

  we are still looking for some good active true
stories of the rail between two and three thou-
sand words in length if you can write one
send it to us for examination but remember the
principal force of such a story is either action
or the record of some unusual happening

  we wish to say a word about the old-time rail-
road poems which have become so popular in
their regular corner in the the carpet those of
our readers who send these old treasures will
confer a great favor on us if whenever it is pos-
sible they will also send the name of the author




the ratlroad mans magazine

and the publication from which the poem was
taken then the proper recognition may be made
and all will be happy

 phone vs telegraph

the following is taken from the records of a
meeting of one of the divisions of the order
of railroad telegraphers of the canadian patific
railway as reported in the railroad telegrapher

  our regular monthly meeting was held yester-
day in the new lodge-room in the empire at bran-
don manitoba with local chairman bro m h
simpson presiding and a large number present
considerable business was transacted and our
chairman so well and favorably known was so
strongly urged upon to continue for another term
that he finally consented to serve

  he called attention to an article in the decem-
ber issue of the railroad mans magazine of
new york headed  despatching trains by tele-
phone and what the western electric company
say about telegraphers their scarcity and the
telegraphers organization and advised them to
read it he contended that it is not only neces-
sary to elect the best element as officers of the
order but we must get them in the legislature
in the senate and in other positions where laws
are made

  as the demand regulates prices on articles of
purchase it should do the same in regard to salary
when there was a scarcity of telegraphers the
new schedule which went into effect last july is
one of the best and most carefully prepared i
ever saw although it does give the agent a decided
ruling over the telegrapher



editor the railroad mass magazine

in john c thomsons article  despatching
trains by telephone you state that  if the
telegraphers fear that the telephone will
eventually obliterate them they alone hold this
view also that it will no more displace the
telegraph than  the u s mail would go out of
existence

  i am a telegrapher of eight years experience and
fully agree with your latter statement for i have
worked as telephone operator handling train-
orders and other matter pertaining to the des-
patching of trains and ask your permission to
take a few exceptions to air thomsons article

  if any of my brother telegraphers fear the tele-
phone has the advantage over the telegraph in the
movement of trains it is because they have not
been unfortunate enough to have had the practi-
cal experience of working with the telephone for
the despatching of trains

  in regard to mr thomsons article you state
editorially that you sincerely believe in the im-
partiality of his presentation of the subject i
beg to differ with you

  mr thomson says the phone is faster of
course an operator can talk much faster than he
can telegraph but can he write down conversa-
tion any faster than he could receiving from the

telegraph no because any telegrapher with a
very few exceptions can keep a fast penman on
the jump or  under the table

  the following conversation took place a short
time ago between a despatcher and an operator to
whom he was trying to give a slow order on
the phone

  despatcher- copy a slow order no 
-two five spelt out to c and e all west
paris period lookout spelt out

  operator- wait a minute now whats that
go ahead  period 

  despatcher-period -o-o-k-o-u-t lookout
f-o-r for cattle c-a-

  operator- whats that after lookout
despatcher-lookout f-o-r for cattle
c-a-t-t-l-e

  operator- i cant get you whats that word
after  for   

  despatcher-its cattle c-a-t-t-l-e cattle
operator- break i dont get you what is
that word after  lookout for

  despatcher- his patience about all in
 c-a-t-t-l-e cattle do you get that
operator- hallo despatcher i lost you
whats that after lookout for

  despatcher- didnt you ever see a cow stoe
bulls yearlings steers cows-c-a-t-t-l-e cattle-
do you know what that is

  operator- oh  all right go ahead  cattle 
the despatcher managed to get through the rest
of the order which was  look out for cattle on
the track between paris and blank

  in sending this order by telegraph one spelling
would have been sufficient and the order would
have been repeated and  o kd  in one-tenth
the time

  in stormy weather the telephone is unsafe and
when in the best of weather figures are hard to
distinguish even with the additional spelling
which is a great time lost you cant make much
distinction between  twenty  and  forty  or
 thirty even when they are spelled out-the
letters sound so much alike

   it opens a channel to railroad employees in-
jured in other lines of work mr thomson says
he should have said that it opens a channel where
a disabled employee gets a chance to operate a
telephone to receive orders thereby risking his
liberty for a few years should he make a mistake
in copying an order w jich is very easy with the
telephone

  i will not gainsay that the telephone is a great
invention but it will never do for despatching
trains under the standard train-order system
where so many figures and letters are used and in
such a way that confusion on the telephone can
never be overcoifie

  in probably twenty or thirty years of experi-
menting we will eventually be able to use the
telephone for despatching trains provided some
plan other than the train-order system is estab-
lished- z oakesdale washington

spme lantern rays

editor the railroad mans magazine

in replying to  i e garber missouri ques-
tion  in your february number you appear
to misunderstand the question  is it safe
for an operator to recopy train-orders

  i shall consider it a favor to reply to this very
important question there are two ways of re-
copying train-orders

  	the inexperienced man or beginner in re-
ceiving train orders from the despatcher is liable
to take a poor copy by reason of nervousness or
through his inability to receive and write down
fast sending hence he may be tempted after re-
peating the order and receiving the despatchers
 o k to make a new copy to display his best
handwriting this procedure consigns the copy
received from the despatcher to the waste-basket
this plan is dangerous and must not only be dis-
couraged but positively forbidden the writer
knows of an instance where two passenger-trains
running at high speed collided owing to an opera-
tor recopying the train-order his despatcher had

sent him and inadvertently inserting the wrong
meeting-point in so doing several persons were
killed or injured in the wreck and the property
loss was very heavy the better plan is for the
operator to issue the original copy to trainmen
even if it is not written as neatly as he is capable
of writing remembering that the inexperienced
of to-day who is careful is the old-timer of to-
morrow whose accurate work and neat penman-
ship arc known all over the division

  	an operator having received a train-order
may find that he has insufficient copies for all con-
cerned this may occur when trains are tied up
by floods washouts or wrecks in this instance
he should set up the required number of extra
copies place his original  correct copy  thereon
and with stylus or hard pencil trace each and
every letter and figure this will avoid any errors
and his extra copies so taken will be a facsimile
of the original

  in further reply to l e  relative to whistle-
signals on the bessemer and lake erie rail-
road the passenger engineers reply to the con-
ductors or brakemans signal for a flag-stop is
three short blasts of the whistle -c m grace
pittsburgh pennsylvania

  the number of letters received corresponding
to mr graces version of the three short blasts
of the whistle leads us to acknowledge our error
and to state that this customary reply is in use
on a good many railroads

what we dont know

editor the railroad mans magazine

i have before me your february number and
note with contempt the extreme ignorance
you are forcing on the public who are in-
veigled irto buying your book by the deceptively
attractive red cover

  now you may be pretty wise as far as maga-
zines go but there is whole lot of things you
dont know about a railroad and i am discharg-
ing a self-imposed duty in telling you


the railroad maxs magazine

  now when you started oul in this magazine
business you should have endeavored to get a
general education as i did i know all about
railroading and you may think i dont know
anything aboui hooks but ill fool you some be-
fore i get through with this i have never had
any actual experience in running a magazine but
i have laken a correspondence course and i know
my business why dont you take one on rail-
roading it would be a great benefit to you in
your present vocation

  you state in your magazine that there is no
such whistle-signal as three short loots of the
whistle there most certainly is do you un-
derstand  there is

  if you want positive convincing proof of this
get aboard of the q t trier  the d m q
and t where they employ orators the badge
says porter after you are located in a seat
get comfortably settled for a couple of hours and
 shut-eye  between the place where you got on
and the blind siding where you want- to gel off
and the said orator will declaim in a loud camp-
meeting voice that the next stop is-some place
where nobody gets off-and continues to iterate
and reiterate the fact until everybody wakes up
to find out that it isnt his station

  when the train gels near your blind siding-
now listen-gets near your blind siding the  ora-
tor  silently reaches for the bell-cord or air-
whistle cord and pulls lustily three times and
the engineer says toot tool toot

  theres a lot more of things i want to tell you
but i just cant spare the time such as how many
trains can a train-despatcher despatch also
the kinzua bridge how about the pecos high
bridge in texas on the ess pee i helped to
build that bridge it is  feet high and over
 feet long

  my letter is meant as a gentle reminder of your
weakness and i will hereby mollify your injured
pride by stating that i enjoy reading your maga-
zine sometimes because of the really good stories
and sometimes because of the humorous explana-
tions and misapplied railroad terms

slip bill alias rough neck

two letters

editor the railroad mans magazine

the railroad mans magazine is
my favorite because of the true to nature
railroad stories written by people who know
what they are talking about but i wish to take a
 fall  out of mr sumner lucas author of the
story  scales that weighed not in the decem-
ber number as mr cal stewart says   have
the goods on him sure

  the story states that a cool million dollars
cash needed by a bank to pay off a run was
placed in a suit-case taken directly into an ex-
press car and locked in the safe by the messenger
who was ignorant of the contents of the suit-case
and who was given a ten-dollar bill by the par-
lies for his trouble as if it were his safe and his
express car

  the story goes on an italian party who was
secreted in a coffin in the car came forth while
the messenger was in the wash-room extracted

                                                  

the suit-case also a package of money from the
safe which the author plainly states was locked
and jumped from the car the messenger re-
turned took a squint at the safe arid the coffin
contracted several kinds of tremens and shakes
and jumped from the car the italian person
was rounded up by a clever detective the money
recovered and everyone made happy-but-

  i would like to be shown the suit-case in
which a million dollars worth of cash could be
packed in the denominations which a bank would
need to pay off a run also the express messenger
who would accept such an apparently valuable
shipment from strangers ignorant of the contents
-minus way-bill and the usual routine of the
express company etc etc

  also how this italian secured the suit-case
from the locked safe taking it for granted that
he could get oul of that coffin put in three suit-
cases and replace the wax mask without attract-
ing the messengers attention

  and i would like to see the messenger who
would become so afflicted through missing a
package containing  and a look at a cof-
fin-box that he would desert his run without a
chirp to any one

  mr lucass idea of an express messenger must
be radically different from the brand we have in
montana the plot of the story is good but the
details cannot  make the grade hoping mr
lucas will give us a real live one next time i
beg to remain-w c erther baker montana

  immediately after reading mr erthers letter
we forwarded it to mr lucas and received the
following reply

editor the railroad mans magazine

never having had  spot cash in
my pocket at any one time i cannot tell
mr erther just how much room it takes
up for fiction writers like railroaders have plenty
of room in a hollow looth for all their surplus
cash but many a time i have carried 
in bills in a side-pocket of my coat and with
my good old sawed-off  in the other for i
lived nearly thirty years west of the big muddy

  this was when i was a bank-clerk some years
ago and as i remember what real money looks
like i dont think i would have much trouble
in packing even  in this old suit-case
of mine

  let mr erther figure it out for himself s-

	in bills that a bank would use to stop a run
takes up about as much room as a common brick-
bat and the inside measurements of my suit-case
are  x  x  inches i think i could get twenty
such bricks into it-if some one gave me a
reasonable chance

  during a run little accounts that are paid in
five-dollar bills do not trouble a bank much
ils the big  explosive  accounts that must be
met with   and -bills that are
dangerous speaking of such bills i have carried
 to  in my vest-pocket going from
bank to bank

  even in gold it might interest mr erther to
know that my suit-case if run full of gold cast
solid would weigh about  pounds and be
worth about  just how many five-
dollar gold pieces it would take to fill it is more
than i am prepared to estimate at a rough guess
on the editorial carpet



i should say over  worth so when it
comes down to mere  or -bills the mat-
ter is easy

  mr erther must remember that fiction by the
way is neither mathematics nor history to
follow his rule in writing fiction would rob us
first jump of hugo dickens scott cooper kip-
ling shakespeare and-myself xo rifle ever
shot like old leather stockings no ghost ever
made disorderly remarks in denmark no naked
boy ever held council on a moonlit rock with
wolves and tigers in indias jungles-fact are
there any wolves in india-so when i had my
express messenger do certain things i was smok-
ing only one pill in my pipe where the bigger
chaps just mentioned evidently inhaled a piece
of dream-dope about the size of a barrel

  actual facts are seldom dramatic they have
to be colored a bit to make good reading there
is nothing more exciting in the world than a
newspaper mans life for instance and nothing
duller to read about facts are to fiction mr
erther will find if he looks into the subject
about what lumber is to furniture or coal iron
and water to an engine if he will glance at the
first picture at hand he will see that practically
nothing in it is drawn according to the right
comparative size one man  near- is ten times
as large as another  farther away

  the rails never come together in actual rail-
road life although they are always shown so in
a picture tis much the same in a story for
a story is only a picture painted with words

  as for the coffin and corpse game that has
been done many times in actual life usually in
getting out of prisons

  if any man wants straight facts and wants
to see how uninteresting exciting events can be
in print when glued to what actually did and
did not happen let him send for a copy of the
official records for a year of the northwest ca-
nadian police or drop into any convenient mon-
tana police headquarters or fire department and
read the official accounts for an hour he will
yawn in ten minutes and take up the rail-
road mans magazine to find something in-
teresting even if it is about so dull a matter as

editorthe railroad mans magazine

having been a constant reader of your
magazine for a long time i will endeavor
to write you a few words and thank you
for myself and in behalf of the other boys here
with me for the enjoyment we have derived from
its pages i do not believe that there is a place
where your magazine is appreciated any more than-
on this dot on the worlds map the evenings
drag mighty slow for us on account of our being
alone the majority of the time this letter has
a long division to run over and it will be in luck
if it doesnt hit an open switch or a storage-spar
before it gets to you

  i followed the iron trail for fifteen years have
seen a good many ups and downs and have had
my time on the up-track for repairs but one of
the happiest moments i know of was when i re-
ceived my first copy of your magazine i had
been in this wilderness nearly five years then

and reading your book seemed to revive the jolly
times i had while on railroads in the states-a

old-time poems

papas late train

by mrs gertie jones

 copyrisht iy by charlie d tillman atlanta ga

a little one tossed on a bed of pain

at the close of a sadrsad day

      the angel of death was hovering near
      to bear her sweet spirit away

but with dim eyes fixed on the old clock nigh
she counted the moments as they went by

and with plaintive moaning anil trembling cry
said papa will be too late

oh papa will be too late oh papa will be too
 late

 his train was due at seven mama

and now it is nearly eight

i wanted to kiss my papa good-by

 im afraid he will be too late

of deaths icy touch she had no fear

her kind loving savior seemed so near

her thoughts were all for her papa dear

oh would he be too late

 oh would he be too late oh would he be too
       late

 swift over the rails through the gloom of the
       night

an engine came thundring down

an hour behind as the wheels stood still

mid the glimmering lights of the town

the engineer rushed home with a trouble deep
and knelt by the cot but too stricken to weep
he had missed the kiss of his darlings last sleep
for papa had come too late

 for papa had come too late for papa had come
       too late

deaths train swiftly bore her sweet spirit away
ere her papas late train moved in

no union now of that heavenly land
with this one of trouble and sin

connection lost by an hours delay

the accepted time had passed away

 ah sad the one who is left to say

  i came too late too late

 i came too late too kite i came too late too
       late

oh fathers have you in that beautiful land
some treasured and innocent one

who safe from the sorrows and cares of life

is waiting for papa to come

 can it be that this earth is all your goal

that youll trifle with god and your own soul
and be as years of eternity roll

forever and ever too late

 forever and ever too late forevei and ever too
       late

ax  engineers story in form regulation

i aint going ter tell-i am not cruel-
            hearted

this story in kind is the first since creation
upon its long journey o mysteries started


the railroad mans magazine

 i loved sallie jenkins-a name thats not takin

 with people what hanker for poetry names
 twas the gal not er name sir that first did
 awaken

 affection in me an enkindled loves flames

 we met an as soon as her purty eyes hit me

 i felt my heart jump like a feller in a doze

 i says  thars a gal whatll jes zackly fit me

 ill hev er no matter what troubles oppose

 i found she was willin but then her ole daddy
 he took down his gun from the garret an said
 if ever i tempted to take her he had me-

 hed draw back the hammer so i would go
     dead

 i knowed he would do it yes cause the old party
 hed won much renown fer sich innocent capers
 his appetite allers fer fightin was hearty

 n much he hed done i hed read in the papers

 but fortune it always smiles out on two lovers

 i rested fer things ter develop themselves
 good luck in the cloud that affrights us oft hovers
 success in calamitys house often dwells

 one evenin at dusk when the moon was up
     creepin

 my train near her home was a chargin with
     might

 ahead near the track there was sumthin a
     leapin

 then a form of a woman grew quick on my
     sight

 she seemed all unconscious of what she was doin
 she heeded no whistle - stepped right on the
 track

 her form to the rails soon the wheels would be
     gluin

 unless by a miracle she was jerked back

 one chance in a thousand reversing the lever
 an makin a leap an a grab at one time

 i landed her over the bank in a quiver

 of terror and gladness-that sweet gal o mine

 next day all the papers was full of the story

  the brave engineer was the idol of all

 her old dad was on me-his eyes no more gory-
 he hugged me while tears from his whiskers
 did fall -

 and now for pure fact in this awful narration-
 fer since we are married the public may scoff-
 that job was put up at that sharp gals dictation
 when i leaped to save her she was twenty feet

   i want to go to morrow

  started on a journey just about a week
 ago

      for the little town of morrow in the state
         of ohio

 i never was a traveler and really didnt know
 that morrow had been ridiculed a century or so
 i went down to the depot for my ticket and
 applied

 for the tips regarding morrow not expecting to
     be guyed

 said i  sly friend i want to go to morrow and
      return

 not later than to-morrow for i havent time to
     burn

said he to me now let me see if i have heayi
    you right

you want to go to morrow and come back to-
    morrow night

you should have gone to morrow yesterday and
    back to-day

for if you started yesterday to morrow dont you

     see

you could have got to morrow and return torday
    at three

the train that started yesterday-now understand
    me right-

to-day it gets to morrow and returns to-morrow
    night

said i  my boy it seems to me youre talking
    through your hat

is there a town named morrow on your line
    now tell me that

 there fa said he  and take from me a quiet
    little tip-

to go from here to morrow is a fourteen-hour
    trip

the train that goes to morrow leaves to-day
    eight-thirty-five

half after ten to-morrow is the time it should
    arrive

now if from here to morrow is a fourteen-hour
    jump

can you go to-day to morrow and come back to-
    day you chump  

said i  i want to go to morrow can i go to-
    day

and get to morrow by to-night if there is no
    delay 

 well well said he  explain to me and ive
    no more to say

can you go anywhere to-morrow and come back
    to-day 

for if to-day youd get to morrow surely vou
    agree

you should have started not to-day but yesterday
    you see	r

so if you start to morrow leaving here to-day
    youre flat

you wont get in to morrow till the day that fol-
    lows that

 now if you start to-day to morrow its a cinch
    youll land

to-morrow into morrow not to-day you un-
    derstand

for the train to-day to morrow if the schedule
    is right

will get you into morrow by about to-morrow
    night

said i  i guess you know it all but kindly let

    me say

how can i go to morrow if i leave the town to-
    day  

said he  you cannot go to morrow any more to- -
    day

for the train that goes to morrow is a mile upon
    its way

 finale

t was so disappointed i was mad enough to
   swear

the train had gone to morrow and had left me
    standing there

the man was right in telling me i was a howling
    jay

i	didnt go to morrow so i guess ill go to-
    day

a mediaeval condition

telephone service-
universal or limited

telephone users make more
local than long distance calls
yet to each user comes the vital
demand for distant communication

  no individual can escape this
necessity it comes to all and can-
not be foreseen

  no community can afford to
surround itself with a sound-proof
chinese wall and risk telephone
isolation

  no american state would be
willing to make its boundary line

an impenetrable barrier to prevent
telephone communication with the
world outside

  each telephone subscriber each
community each state demands to
be the center of a talking circle
which shall be large enough to
include all possible needs of
inter-communication

  in response to this universal
demand the bell telephone system
is clearing the way for universal
service

every belt telephone is the center of the system
