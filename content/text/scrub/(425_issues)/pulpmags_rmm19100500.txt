cleanly habits to produce a
healthy skin

the use of pears soap
prevents the irritability redness
and blotchy appearance from which
many children suffer and prevents
unsightly disease which so baffles
dermatologists and hinders the proper physical
and moral development of the child

pears soap produces a matchless complexion which
not only gives natural beauty but a matchless comfort
to the body

    health beauty and happiness follow the use of
pears soap the mothers of today can well follow
the example of the last six generations and have their
memory revered by teaching their children to use

pears soap

       mothers day is to be observed all over the united states the second sunday in may to
       honor and uplift motherhood and to give comfort and happiness to the best mother who
       ever lived-your mother in loving remembrance of your mother do some distinct act of

hold-ups that missed fire

by frank marshall white

getting away with it is the chief and most hazardous part of the hold-
up mans game almost anybody can stop a train by hook or by crook
and even getting to the goods is comparatively simple but when the
robbers back is turned when the threatening danger of his gun is removed
when every move he is making is laying a clue-there is the almost insur-
mountable difficulty if the big swede had kept his head he might have got
away with it so might the other desperadoes mentioned in this story but
they were doomed before they started by their own inefficiency

men who have embraced the dangers of opposing the law and
have lacked in nerve or brains to see
it through

  now then you engineer turn
round and go through the firemans pock-
ets be quick about it because your
engine is likely to need attention
fischer turned at once and did as he
was bidden taking everything out of his
fellow employees raiment including a
 revolver which he handed butt first
to a man of gigantic-stature who was
standing within two feet of him and
covering him with another 

   back up here now said the giant
hurling the captured weapon from the
engine over his shoulder

  fischer promptly turned and hacked
and his captor went through the engi-
neers pockets with his left hand reliev-
ing him of their contents which also
included a revolver that might have been
a brother of the other two nicoll mean-
while standing with his hands still above

he helena express on the
northern pacific railroad
in montana was just cross-
ing the little green river
bridge after leaving gal-
latin on a moonlight night
caspar fischer the engineer with his
fireman john nicoll were standing to-
gether at the cab window when a stern
voice behind them suddenly commanded
 hands up-both of you-quick 
fischer and nicoll had their hand-
above their heads before the man at their
backs had fully issued the mandate

  neither turned his head it being eti-
quette in montana under such conditions
to await directions before moving since
a desperado with a pistol is ver-y likely
to mistake any action for a hostile one

  in another second came this sharp sec-
ond command


the railroad mans magazine

his head and his back to the other occu-
pants of the engine realizing that an
unwary motion was likely to prove fatal

  the giant threw the engineers pistol
into the ditch beside the track as he had
that of the fireman and issued further
instructions

  engine need any attention he in-
quired briskly of fischer  if she dont
take this rope and tie up the fireman
and he handed him a piece of strong
cord about five feet in length again
using his left handand still keeping the
engineer covered with the pistol fischer
barely felt the throttle of the big ma-
chine that was -whirling the express along
the tracks and finding everything all
right with her took the cord and pro-
ceeded to bind his firemans arms

   make a good job of that warned
the giant calmly but in a tone calcu-
lated to compel close attention  if he
comes unbound ill shoot you and let
aim run the engine 

the big swede

  fischer took pains and did make a
good job of it then nicoll was ordered
to go back to the tender and lie down on
the coal the engineer was compelled
to bind the others feet with another piece
of cord furnished by their captor

  both the fireman and the engineer by
this time had recognized their new and
summary acquaintance from descriptions
they had heard and read of his great
stature flat nose and fair hair as her
man young a hold-up man with a repu-
tation known in that part of the coun-
try as the  big swede

  the big swede turned his attention
to fischer pistol in hand

   neither of you fellows is a tender-
foot he said to the engineer  and
you know perfectly well that if you obey
orders nothing is going to happen to
you  and that if you dont obey orders
something will happen mighty sudden
when we get to the siding at the foot of
the incline four miles along stop the
train and uncouple the express-car
well take that car along with us a
ways

  there was nothing for it but to obey
as fischer knew perfectly well

  it was about ten-thirty oclock when

the express reached the siding at the foot
of the incline designated by the big
swede and obeying his orders fischer
stopped the train still following in-
structions the engineer jumped from the
engine to the ground followed by his
captor with finger on the trigger of his
pistol

train-crew kept dark

  the-cnductor and the train-crew had
surmised the reason for the stopping of
the train and they did not venture to
show themselves any nearer to the engine
than the rear platform of the last car
they would have been fools if they had
for they did not know how many were
in the attacking party nor from what
point along the track a shot might come

  at the point of the big swedes pistol
fischer uncoupled the express-car from
the passenger - coaches behind it and
from the baggage-car in front then he
returned to the engine and hauled the
baggage-car out on the siding coming
back on the main track and closing up
to the express-car

  he got down from the engine to turn
the switch at each end of the siding and
again to couple the express-car to the
engine on each occasion escorted by the
desperado with the pistol cocked and
ready

  during all this period the train-crew
and the passengers remained inside the
car indeed few of the passengers knew
that any unusual occurrence had stopped
the train

had dynamite ready

  under youngs direction fischer took
the express-car up the incline and ran
it some two miles away from the rest of
the train where he brought it to a stand-
still there was no other train due
along the line for several hours so that
there was no immediate danger of a
collision and now the engineer and his
captor approached the baggage-car where
the latter called upon the express mes-
senger ike perkins there being no
response the big swede produced a stick
of dynamite from his boot-leg and made
fischer blow the door open the explosion
tearing out one end of the car
hold-ups that missed fire



  approaching this aperture forcing
fischer to walk before him as a shield
the desperado discovered perkins with
cocked revolver standing guard over the
property committed to his care and
called upon him to throw his weapon out
of the car and empty his pockets the
express messenger obeyed orders he
could not shoot at the robber without
endangering the life of fischer on the

explosion a mass of loose yellow coin
rolled out on the floor-seventeen thou-
sand dollars in gold double-eagles the
sight temporarily unbalanced the big
swedes mind and with a roar of de-
light he dropped both of his pistols and
fell head forward into the golden flood
attempting to pick up an armful in a
fraction of a second perkins seized a
piece of the wreckage of the car and

other hand perkins afforded a fair mark
for young

  once inside the express car the big
swede cool and masterful produced an-
other revolver and more dynamite and
covering both of the other men with his
battery he ordered them to blow open
the safe which he knew to contain many
thousands of dollars in actual cash

the big swedes mistake

  and now a surprising thing happened
as the safe fell apart at the sound of the

struck the desperado a terrible blow over
the back of his head

  the big swede did not recover con-
sciousness until noon the following day
when he found himself under guard in
the hospital at montana pie is at pres-
ent serving a term of fifty years in state
prison for the hold-up men get long sen-
tences in montana

  it is the circumstance that by reason
of the enormous productiveness of the
soil over vast but under-populated areas
in montana it is difficult always to safe-
guard the overflow of wealth that has

his captor went through the engineers pocket


the railroad mans magazine

brought lawless and desperate men into
the state it is because of these condi-
tions that the shrievalty in these prosper-
ous agricultural districts goes to that man
whose integrity is not only beyond chance
of reproach but whose physical strength
and courage are one with his public spirit
it is not a case of setting a thief to catch
a thief in that part of the country for
the holder of the office of sheriff not only
must be as quick on the trigger and seem-
ingly as reckless of life as the prowling
marauder it is his duty to suppress but
he must possess the highest confidence of
the community he binds himself to pro-
tect and be prepared to sacrifice his own
interests at all times for the pubic wel-
fare

a sheriffs duty

  milton w potter former sheriff of
carbon county montana who has a
record of riding live days and nights with
only one square meal and not more than
an hour or two of sleep at a time in
pursuit of two outlaws who had com-
mitted murder said to the writer re-
cently 

   a sheriff out there must be always
ready to jump on a horse at a moments
notice prepared to ride like a crow in-
dian without food or water

  the duties of the office are arduous
but to hold it is an honor sought by good
citizens

  the activity of the montana sheriffs
has rid the state of most of the more
dangerous of the hold-up men but the
chance of making a fortune in one job
by the looting of a money-laden express-
car continues to lure desperadoes

  indeed even boys have tried their hand
at the game last april three young
ruffians all under twenty-one years of
age attempted a hold-up at home stake
where the northern pacific trains stop
just before coming into butte the boys
who had evidently read about the meth-
ods of train-robbers had concealed them-
selves behind the water-tank at home-
stake as the train came in and then
climbed aboard the engine tender and
hid in the coal as it pulled out

  when the train was well under way the
trio each with a revolver appeared be-
fore frank clow the engineer and de-

manded that he stop the train clow
reached down probably to operate the
air-brake it is supposed but the boys be-
lieving that he was reaching for a weapon
fired at him all together killing him in-
stantly

  they were caught and are serving
sentences of eighty years each which
with commutation for good behavior will
bring their terms down to something like
thirty years

  another desperado named kinnicutt
who was a novice in the use of dynamite
wrecked a train at bear mouth on the
northern pacific last may for the sake
of the contents of the safe in the express-
car and though he effected the deaths
of three better men was himself captured
and hanged the train on this occasion
was running at the rate of some twenty
miles an hour five miles from the station
about eleven oclock one night when the
engine exploded a tremendous charge of
dynamite on the track and was blown to
the top of an embankment thirty feet
high killing the engineer fireman and
a brakeman who happened to be on the
front platform of the baggage-car the
other cars were thrown from the track
but the passengers suffered only minor
cuts and bruises

hoist with own petard

  during the confusion attendant on the
catastrophe a man was found lying
unconscious one hundred feet from the
wreck he proved to be kinnicutt him-
self who not being aware of the force
of the explosive he had used had re-
mained too close to the track before
he was hanged in august he was shot
through the hips while attempting to
break jail at butte

  another montana bandit was equally
unfortunate with the others whose mis-
adventures have been related this fel-
low who has not been identified had
developed a scheme with another who
escaped without being recognized on
this occasion the eastern express from
billings which was carrying a big ship-
ment of gold was to have been held-up
ten miles out of the town one of the
would-be robbers took a seat in the pas-
senger-car at billings and the other got
aboard the rear platform of the baggage-
hold-ups that missed fire



perkins seized a piece of th
struck the

car whence he crawled over the top to
the engine tender

  now it so happened that conductor
jackman for some reason or other be-
came suspicious of the man in the pas-
senger-car and when that person fol-
lowed him out to the platform a quarter
of an hour after leaving billings he was
prepared for him the result was that 
each drew a revolver and that jackman
got his out first and shot the other man
through the heart

  meantime the confederate had reached
the tender of the engine but before he
had attempted to hold up the engineer

wreckage of the car and
desperado

the conductor had pulled the communi-
cation cord as a signal to stop the train
upon the shooting of rascal no 

  rascal no  evidently surmised that
the scheme to rob the express was not
working smoothly for the engineer saw
him jump from the engine as the- train
began to slow down

  the incident that was most talked
about in montana in  wherein was
shown the kind of sheriffs out there and
also the perils to which they are sub-
jected had its real beginning some eight
years before

  on that occasion a western desperado


the railroad mans magazine

vjt ti-

ll proved to be
kinnicutt

hnrry roche with a companion whose
identity was not established planned to
rob the northern pacific express at
logan

  both sneaked to the rear platform of
the baggage-car as the train was leaving
this point and roche sent the other man
over the top of the car to deal with the
engineer he had some doubts as to his
confederates nerve and hence he watched
him closely just as the fellow was drop-
ping from the front platform of the car
roche who was a pretty shot with a re-
volver put a bullet through his brain
from the rear-platform steps

the sheriff shot

  the desperado was recognized as he
leaped from the train and although the
death of a hold-up man was no loss to
the community sheriff george t young
of logan county determined to capture
roche and put him out of the way

  with his deputy frank beller the
sheriff started in pursuit of the desperado
overtaking him at the station at spring-
ville just after dark on the evening after
the killing of his partner

  roche saw the two men coming from
a window of the station and went out
into the darkness of the platform and
with drawn pistol watched the station
door

  as the sheriff came out with the light
behind him roche shot him through the
heart and when he fell and beller
stooped to pick him up he sent a bullet
into the deputys lungs from which the
deputy recovered after a long illness

  the double murder-as it was at first
supposed to be-of the sheriff and his
deputy roused montana and wyoming as
no similar occurrence had ever done
roches description with the news of his
crime was immediately telegraphed and
telephoned to the remotest points

  the police all over the west were
hold-ups that missed fire



notified and every railway station in
montana and wyoming was watched
young had been a leading citizen of
logan he was personally popular and
his friends swore that his death should
be avenged

  no trace of roche was ever found and
nothing ever heard of him it was gen-
erally believed that he had either com-
mitted suicide or had died of exposure

  among the personal friends of sheriff
young who took an active part in the
search for roche was the prosecuting
attorney of yellowstone county a lead-
ing resident lawyer and property owner
of billings john brooke herford by
name herford who had come to the
west some twenty years before is of
english birth a son of the rev dr
brooke herford before his death a cele-
brated unitarian clergyman in london

  he is also a brother of beatrice her-
ford the monologist and of oliver
herford famous as playwright and wit
herford was one of the first men to
volunteer in the search for roche and
among the last to give up

didnt know his capture

  sheriff john t webb of yellowstone
county traced a man who was wanted
for grand larceny at basin in big horn
county to james richardsons sheep-
ranch fifty miles from billings and ar-
rested him the arrest was made early
in the afternoon out on the ranch five
miles from the house whither richard-
son had driven the sheriff on a buckboard
his horse having been left in the stable

  the prisoner had been working on the
ranch for several weeks under the name
of buck jones when he was informed
that he was under arrest he asked the
sheriff if he might go into a covered
wagon close by that contained such
primitive toilet accessories as are in use
on sheep-ranches and clean himself up
a bit before being taken away

  the man who called himself buck
jones was none other than harry roche
who since the murder of sheriff young
eight years before had been working as
a ranch-hand having in some manner
avoided identification sheriff webb be-
lieving him to be an ordinarily harmless
criminal good-naturedly allowed him to

visit the wagon which was only a few
feet away

  roche was well aware that if he were
taken into a court of justice anywhere
in montana he would be sure to be rec-
ognized by some one there when his
shrift would be short there was a
winchester rifle in the wagon and a sec-
ond after the presumed buck jones had
climbed in sheriff webb who was talk-
ing to richardson heard the stern com-
mand hold up your hands turn-
ing he saw his prisoner covering him
with a rifle not ten feet away

no quarter

  now while it is considered no dis-
grace for the ordinary citizen in the
troublous parts of the west to put up
his hands when another man has the drop
on him it is not- etiquette on the part of
a sheriff consequently webb only
reached for his revolver whereupon
roche shot him through the heart as he
had sheriff young

  richardson who was a very ill man at
the time - in fact he died under an
operation for appendicitis a week later-
had no weapon with him but his former
employee offered him no injury he mere-
ly took the dead mans revolver and cart-
ridge-belt and started away across the
ranch carrying the winchester rifle also

  richardson drove -fhe buckboard back
to his house the horse at a gallop and
telephoned the news of the murder of
webb to deputy sheriff taylor at bil-
lings the news threw the town into an
uproar for webb was a prominent citi-
zen a silent kindly man and aside from
that he represented the majesty of the
law

  as had been the case when sheriff
young was murdered the news of 
killing of webb was telegraphed and tele-
phoned all over montana and wyoming
there was a general uprising to hunt
down the murderer armed men closing
in upon richardsons ranch from east
west north and south

  special trains to carry the man-hunters
were run to billings the nearest railroad-
point to the sheep - ranch from miles
city and from forsyth in wyoming
while mounted deputies from the nearer
towns and citizens carrying rifles from

bozeman big timber red lodge co-
lumbus laurel round up lewiston
basin and a score of other places hur-
ried to the scene of the tragedy as fast as
horses and steam could take them

as it happened one of the first men

the sleeping-quarters of the men who
cared for the stock

  the fugitive was not likely to let them
get too close and they had no means of
knowing how clever a marksman he was
as he had killed webb at short range

deputy sheriff taylor met when he ran
out of his office to spread the news of
webbs murder was john b herford
one of the victims best friends herford
had just come into town from bear creek
in his touring-car and only waiting long
enough to go to his house for his rifle and
revolvers and taking taylor into his car
he put on all speed for richardsons
ranch fifty miles away which was
reached in an hour and a half

they were good targets

  the departure of the two men had
been telephoned to richardson who had
horses waiting and getting directions as
to the course the murderer had taken
they galloped out over the ranch with
weapons ready herford and the deputy
sheriff were exposed on horseback and
made excellent targets for the desperado
who might be in any one of the covered
sheep-wagons which placed at varying
distances apart over the big ranch were

they did know that a good shot might
pick both riders at long range

  however the men rode from one
wagon to another inquiring for traces of
the sheriffs murderer and finally located
him -in one of the sheep-wagons about
seven miles from the spot where he had
shot webb he hadmade holes in the
canvas cover on both sides of the vehicle
through which he could put the end of
his rifle and he made his presence known
by a shot that whistled by herfords
head following it up by -another that
was intended for taylor  fortunately
for them lie did not prove to be an ex-
pert with the rifle

  the horsemen waited until the man in
the wagon fired again and instantaneous-
ly returned his fire aiming just below
the point where the flash of his rifle was
seen he responded promptly and thir-
ty or forty shots were exchanged during
the next half-hour

  it had been a fine spring day but now
about four oclock in the afternoon it
hold-ups that missed fire



suddenly turned cold and began to grow
dark while the wind rose and snow be-
gan to fall creating exactly the condi-
tions favorable for an escape if the
hunted man were able to hold off his pur-
suers for only a few minutes more they

felt that he might easily slip out of
their sight in the darkness and snow

the inevitable end

  then herford took a desperate chance
he was a dead-shot with a pistol and
handing his rifle to the deputy sheriff he
suddenly rode down on the sheep-wagon
at full speed pistol in hand four bul-
lets flew by his head as he approached
the last one taking off his hat at trine
moment that aiming in at the rear of
the wagon as he dashed by he shot the
murderer through the brain

  the men found then that others of
their shots had broken one of his legs in
two places so that his escape would have
been impossible

  that was the end of  buck jones
hut it was not until several days later that
it was learned that it had been the end
also of harry roche train-robber and
triple murderer

his end was the well-nigh inevitable

one the law of a life for a life exacted
by human justice has its root deeper than
the human will it is inborn in circum-
stance and after all the chief charac-
teristic of train-robbers and of all other
robbers for the matter of that has al-
ways been futility

   a grim visage a desperate de-
termination and a gun are poor
substitutes for the particular ef-
ficiency which is really a prod-
uct of moral directness many
of our  stick-up  friends often
for a time have seemed to defy
the law of the community and the
law that works for ultimate jus-
tice but always in the end they
have been caught up with

   sometimes the  catching up 
has resulted in the end of a rope
or a long residence in prison at
other times the  catching up 
has been more secret but not less
terrible always it seems that
the deficiency that causes men
to attempt the achievement of
wealth without taking a legiti-
mate part in the worlds indus-
tries is a symptom of failure
even in the violent profession of
their own choosing

   at any rate train robbery as a means
of getting a living seems to be rapidly
falling into disfavor for the simple rea-
son that it has become more and more un-
profitable now and then there are spas-
modic and isolated attempts to revive the
industry as in the case of the pennsyl-
vania hold-up of recent history but as
in that case the game has usually proved
to be worth something less than the
grease of the candle

   patrolled tracks do not lend them-
selves readily to the exploits of hold-up
men neither do steel cars mighty safes
and splendidly organized railway pri-
vate and city detective systems the par-
ticular brand of incompetent who once
turned his gun upon the engineer has been
compelled to choose some less heroic out-
let for his villainy and aside from this
the legal punishment for train-robbery in
some states is too severe to lure the high-
wayman to take chances in a game that
may or may not be profitable even if he
is not eventually caught

four bullets flew by his head as he approached
the last one taking off his hat
a hero for hazelle

by frank condon

        when you steal an engineers girl dont
        wear a swiss hat with a sassy green feather

here was a train on the
n y e known as the can-
non-ball limited mail it
was more than a mere thing
of wheels wood and glass
it was a sacred institution
they had photographs of it in the wait-
ing-rooms all along the road and when-
ever the line advertised it used a cut of
the cannon-ball tearing ovej- the trestle
at washington span with wisps of steam
shooting out of her cylinders officials
spoke of the train with respect the presi-
dent invariably rode over the line on her
once a year and it was the ambition of
every engineer and fireman to land in the
cab of the big mogul that dragged the
cannon - ball daily from cincinnati to
philadelphia

  the cannon-ball was an -mail af-
fair- six heavy coaches the govern-
ment kept an eye on her like old mr
thomas cat at a rat-hole in a moment
of aberration at some distant date the
n v e had contracted to carry mail
to tidewater and as the government
seemed a trifle peevish about past service
the n v e flipped its fingers and an-
nounced to the government that while
somebodys railroad might bring mail in
late the n v e was doing business on a
different line

  to show the government what a real
railroad could do in the way of being
prompt the n y e guaranteed to de-
liver six coaches loaded with mail every
day at philadelphia from the west and
for every minute the cannon - ball was
late in pulling in the n v e woidd pay
the government the sum of ten dollars

  it sounded like an earnest proposition
to washington and before the n y e

realized it the road was bound up by a
contract that couldnt be broken by harsh
words dynamite or legal prestidigita-
tors

  ten dollars a minute amounts to con-
siderable money when a train is a few
hours late when the n y e got down
to business the general superintendent had
a long serious talk with the men who were
to run the cannon-ball

  he impressed them one and all that
the n y e regarded ten - dollar bills
with distinct reverence and if they were
singly or collectively guilty of bringing
the train in late they woidd be taken out
and hanged to the beams in the round-
house immediately after arrival there
was one loophole the government ad-
mitted that human man could not over-
come certain acts of providence when
providence happened to tip a cloudburst
over the n y e system and wash away
its rails the government would not insist
upon its pound of flesh other than this
there was no escape the cannon-ball
must be on time

  railroads are railroads and govern-
ments are governments and mail is mail

  but what are these to love

  no far-seeing railroad would ever at-
tach to the throttle of the cannon-ball
mail a young engineer who was hopeless-
ly in love provided the railroad knew he
was in love

  if the railroads could have their way
about it they would not permit falling in
love they would prefer married men
but in this instance the n y e knew
nothing about the state of jerry skel-
dons heart it knew that he had a steady
hand and a keen eye that he had nerve
and courage that he could tear the old
a hero for hazelle



cannon-ball along at anywhere from
seven to seventy miles and that he rarely
was five seconds late at any point on the
line

  jerry skeldon was particularly young
to be the engineer of the important train
over which the government was watching
and if he had not been in love for some
time and therefore was totally unable
to do anything about it he would have
refrained from getting into such a state
as a matter of duty to his railroad

  two years before young skeldon was
a fireman one sunny afternoon while
his train was running through the red-
clay cut six miles east of northampton
he had carelessly waved a begrimed hand-
kerchief at a girl on the lip of the cut

  all he could tell about the girl was
that she seemed young and slender and
that her gown was one of those fluffy
apple-blossom affairs that men like to see

  on that trifling and accidental salute de-
pended grave things and weighty matters
the fluffy girl was on the top of the red-
clay cut two days later when jerrys train
banged along toward winchester nat-
urally he waved again this time with a
perfectly clean white - handkerchief to
his surprise the vision waved back at
him

  thus for two months fireman and girl
greeted each other every second day and
when the girl missed a week without once
appearing jerry skeldon took a leave of
absence and chased himself out to north-
ampton where he found after careful
sleuthing that a girl named hazelle
hoisington was ill with typhoid

  he wired for extended leave put up at
the lone hotel in northampton bought
flowers fruit and books and when the
girl was able to sit up in bed he came in
one day and shook hands with her

to his surprise the vision waved
back at him


the railroad mans magazine

     glad youre getting better said jer-
  ry skeleton  im the fireman on the
  cannon-ball ive been waiting here for
  two weeks till you got better

    the girl smiled at him wanly and he
 became a member of the household ha-
 zelles father and mother may have been
 surprised but they could not deny jer-
 rys solicitude nor his flowers

   in a few weeks he returned to the
 world of fire-boxes signal-lamps and
 switches and he did so with a sort of un-
 derstanding with miss hoisington they
 were to be married eventually every
 week jerry came to northampton rented
 a livery-rig and then drove abroad among
 the trees and fields

    jerry had been accustomed to parting
 company with his income as rapidly as
 possible and before marrying it was
 necessary that he should accumulate a
 working capital

    he started about it within a week after
  reaching the agreement in northampton
  two weeks following that he was made
  an engineer in appreciation of service
  well done

   later on when the n y e landed
 the government mail contract he took the
 throttle of the big atlantic at the head of
 that stately train

    for a time life was roses and honey

    every second day the cannon-ball shot
  through northampton and six miles to
  the east jerry leaned from his cab and
   waved to his sweetheart it was a brief
  signal but it was the sort of wireless that
  really amounts to something

    then they had a quarrel-a bitter vio-
  lent quarrel every lover knows these
  quarrels they begin over a trifle and
  pick up speed with amazing rapidity

    this one ended as they all do

    hazelle told jerry to leave her home
  and never darken the doorway again she
  had long suspected him now she was
  sure he was a selfish brute no girl
  in her right mind would ever think of as-
  sociating with him

    jerry indulged in a few brilliant re-
  marks which he would have given a
  million dollars a syllable to retract when
  it was too late to retract slammed the
  door and departed from northampton
  with murder in his heart

  thereafter no slim figure waved at him
  from the top of the red-clay cut he

rounded the long curve every second day
doing his regular sixty-five miles and
hoping against hope that she would ap-
pear

  she did not appear neither did she
send him letters he wrote her a chas-
tened and subdued apology after which
ensued a deep silence

  in the meantime jerry nearly lost his
job twice he pulled into philadelphia
thirty seconds late the superintendent
called him on the carpet his fireman
snickered at him unfeelingly

  the final blow came one wednesday
morning it was the bright sunny kind
of weather that makes a man feel glad
he lives and jerry had almost come back
to normal he was urging the big at-
lantic to her best pace and northampton
slipped away into the distance like a
shadow

  the cannon-ball approached the fa-
miliar red-clay cut at some seventy miles
and jerry cast an involuntary glance up
ward

  then he felt his heart bob violently
twice in a horizontal line twice in a ver-
tical direction and once in a complete
circle after which it fell out his anatomy
altogether-as it seemed to him

  hazelle was again part of the scenery
she was sitting on the top of a broad
fence swinging a pair of dainty ankles
and staring at the oncoming cannon-
ball in a most insulting manner-much
as she might have regarded the course of
an offensive cockroach across the kitchen-
floor

   beside her shoulder to shoulder sat a
tall young man wearing a swiss hat from
which protruded a  sassy  greei feather

  he probably wore other garments at
the moment but it is difficult to take in
a multitude of sartorial details from the
cab-window of a government mail-train
that is making speed

  jerry smothered a large piece of pro-
fanity then he loosened the throttle
another notch and tore through water-
vliet at an awful speed

   i wonder jerry mused- i wonder
who that guy is 

   for sixty miles he repeated this mystic
phrase and when in the roundhouse
coogan his fireman spoke to him respect-
fully about the leaky state of the injector
he poured a torrent of wrath upon that
a hero for hazelle



surprised individual and drove him from
the cab with harsh words

coogan had not noticed the man and
the girl consequently he could not ex-
plain to himself the mental state of his
engineer

but he spoke about it in the philadel-

  it was a blasphemous thought the
cannon-ball stopped four times between
cincinnati and philadelphia-and four
times only she took on water for the
cavernous cylinders to suck up there
was absolutely no other reason for stop-
ping unless a glacier came down from

phia yards to morgan the turntable man
he also promised himself the pleasure of
taking a careful poke at jerry skeldon
the next time that engineer insulted him
without reason

  on friday jerry saw them again sit-
ting on the top rail of the fence swing-
ing their feet and looking down at him as
one examines a flea beneath a microscope

  he choked with rage again and
fought off a wild impulse to push the
throttle-valve home throw on the air
leap from the cab and reach that fellow
with the swiss cap and the green feather
without delay

the north pole and removed the road from
the map

  for another week engineer skeldon
came through northampton on time and
every trip brought him the vision of two
happy souls on the top of the red-clav
cut

  on the following saturday as he
climbed into his cab at crotonia his lips
were firm he spoke no word to coo-
gan and that gentleman respected his si-
lence

  if the n y e and the government
could have known what was in engineer
skeldons mind another engineer would


the railroad mans magazine

have pulled the cannon-ball out of cro-
tonia

  it was a crisp breezy morning he
could see miles down the track as the
heavy train sang into northampton and
out jerry leaned a bit farther from the
cab and glued his eyes to the clump of
trees behind which lay the red-clay cut

  they were there sitting on the fence
as usual

  then something absolutely unprece-
dented happened to the cannon-ball lim-
ited mail

  jerry skeldon threw on the air with a
violence that jerked the mail-clerks off
their feet jaunched the conductor out of
a peaceful doze in the last coach and
horrified fireman coogan into a state of
open-mouthed amazement

  the cannon-ball grunted and screamed
as the brake - shoes clutched the flying
wheels in thirty seconds she had stopped
then she began to back up slowly and
coogan heard jerry yell

   take the throttle coogan stop her
in the cut

  the fireman had a brief vision of his
respected engineer leaping from the steps
of the cab jerry disappeared instantly
and the numbed coogan stepped into his
seat and brought the cannon-ball slowly
to a halt

  so this was the cannon-ball limited
mail was it coogan communed stopped
in a cut while its engineer went picking
daisies and huckleberries coogan was
no man of imagination he didnt know
what to do under the circumstances so he
didnt do anything he sat on jerrys
cushions gaping about the mail-clerks
threw open their iron-barred doors and
jumped to the ground

  the conductor rushed up from the last
coach panting and demanded to know
by the name of the great san wack what
it meant

  where was skeldon the cannon-ball
was behind time

  down in coogans soul the spirit of
loyalty stirred they could curse and
revile jerry skeldon but jerry skeldon
was not the man to leave his train without
reason they must wait for him coogan
announced

  he would return presently and the
cannon-ball would make up the lost time
fifteen minutes were used up in a jaw-

ing-match in which every clerk on the
mail participated and in which the con-
ductor lost his power of speech complete-
ly and took to meaningless sounds

  finally the general offices of the n y
e were in a tumult watervliet had
wired the pleasing information that the
cannon-ball was fifteen minutes late and
had not yet whistled

   shes wrecked   lamented the gen-
eral offices

  the cannon-ball was not wrecked she
was standing placidly in the red-clay cut
six miles east of northampton like a do-
mesticated cow the smoke oozed peace-
fully from the mouth of her blunt stack
and the steam whispered in the cocks all
was calm

  and in the meantime her trusted en-
gineer was making history when he
jumped from his cab and hopped across
the culvert he turned toward the low
ground that led up to the crest of the cut
and in a few minutes reached the top of
the embankment

  two persons were disturbed immediate-
ly the girl saw jerry coming before her
comrade was aware of the overalled gri-
my-handed oil-stained engineer she slid
down from the fence jerry kept his eyes
fastened upon the insulting green feather
in the swiss hat and as he approached on
the dead run the feather became more
 sassy

  its wearer was a tall healthy specimen
of manhood he turned in time to meet
jerrys onrush so that there was nothing
unfair in the attack

  hazelle emitted one piercing shriek and
then stood wide-eyed with her knuckles
buried in her white cheeks

  jerry weighed perhaps a hundred and
sixty and his antagonist was twenty
pounds heavier but the engineer was
wire and muscle and it was an even
match-and a good fight to see if ha-
zelle could only have appreciated it

  now fight hissed jerry into the
strangers ear and fight your best be-
cause i am going to do you within an inch
of your life  

  for fifteen minutes the two circled on
the top of the cut swaying in each others
grasp at times and again falling back
under a rain of blows

  jerry landed a scorching right to swiss
hats jaw and swiss hat smeared jerry
a hero for hazelle



with a curling sweep that peeled away two  where is your train  she asked
inches of outer skin and filled the erigi-  its waiting for me in the cut and
neers eyes with water	ive got to go im an hour late he

jerry smashed in a straight punch to looked at his watch it was smashed and
the nose and followed with a left to the useless
ribs swiss hat doubled

jerry with a right to the 	---

stomach and j erry closed	

his foes right eye with a

in twenty minutes
both gladiators had be-
gun to weaken they

were drawing in their	

breath in great sobs
and the perspiration and

blood mingled and ran	   -  - jf	 mn	

down their faces in thin
streams

twenty feet away ha-
zelle hoisington stood
speechless

jerry finished the fight
suddenly with two crash-
ing blows and a right-
hander to swiss hats
face that toppled him
forward as he lurched
into jerrys arms he was
met with a terrific left-
hand swing to the jaw
that sent him to the
ground

he lay still

jerry turned to the
girl pulling at his hand-

v rjpj s

he gasped you made

cause its the only place that wont hurt soaked handkerchief

she hesitated for an instant but his arm she waved back at him briefly then
was around her 	he disappeared

then she picked out the uninjured eye ten frantic trainmen grabbed him and
and kissed it lightly	hurled him into his cab


the railroad mans magazine

hes a pippin on the upper cut

   this groaned the conductor  is the
end of you and me and the ruination of
the cannon-ball were an hour late

   shut up  said jerry

  he pulled the throttle open and the
cannon - ball moved forward coogan
was staring at his battered face but asked
no questions

  there was no possibility of bringing
the train into philadelphia on time

  the lost hour would cost the n y e
 if there were no more delays and
jerry would bfe discharged in disgrace

  there was no excuse to be offered he
realized it as he sat in the cab with his
handkerchief pressed to his swollen nose

   hes a pippin on the upper cut
mused jerry

  four miles beyond watervliet lies the
kingston river it is not a dignified
sensible river running guardedly be-
tween its banks but rather it is a sense-

less body of water aimless fu-
tile seven inches deep and two
miles wide the n y e had
built a trestle across this two-
mile stretch of swamp and had
guarded the railway approach
with four kinds of safety sig-
nals

  all of them were working as
the cannon-ball thundered up
the long incline the trestle
was burning grandly and ef-
fectively 

  four of the central spans had
disappeared into the swamp in
fiery cinders and jerry skeldon
stopped his tram fifty yards
away and breathed a long deep
breath

  a burning trestle is not
technically speaking an act of provi-
dence but it is almost that no train
in the world can pass over a burning
trestle especially when four of the spans
have disappeared the government could
not collect from the n y e

  in three hours a relief-train had been
rushed forward under special orders the
mail - train was ordered back to white-
house where the n y e connected with
the western pennsylvania and a train-
load of mail arrived in philadelphia later
on twelve hours late skeldon was saved

  the government read the n y e re-
port and growled but it said nothing

  in the superintendents office that stern
official looked at jerrys bruised face

   get that mug at the kingston trestle
fire  he asked sharply

  no replied skeldon truthfully  i
got it somewhere else along the line how
would you like one toanatch it

first florida conductor

captain j r tucker who got his
final clearance papers in this world
a few months ago at st petersburg florida
is said to have been the first conductor to
run in that state he was born in south
carolina in  but his parents went to
florida when he was a child

  his first railroad experience was as con-
ductor on the first train of what is reported
to have been the first railroad in florida
it ran from st marks on the gulf to a

point near the georgia line at the begin-
ning of the civil war mr tucker resigned
as conductor to raise a company of cavalry
and he served throughout the war on the
side of the confederacy

  after the war he returned to railroading
and was still in the service when he reached
his seventieth year when he was pensioned
by the atlantic coast line the captains
death was unexpected as in spite of his
seventy-four years he was hale and active
  told in the smoker

by olin crawford

the things that happen to the captains of the grip in the days run
are as varied as the lines of goods they sell and as
exciting as some of the stories they tell

by bat with a bow in the back sporty
suit in checks red waistcoat and a fine
outfit of neckties and fancy shirts youd
know somebody was coming to see the
 doc  headed your way

   at the grand central he got on a
train for buffalo which was to be his
first stop tucked himself away in a low-
er berth and slept like a log till they
rolled into the buffalo yards as he
groped around for his clothes he couldnt
find his trousers into which he had
stuffed his watch and all his money

   he rang the bell for the porter and
asked him to help in the search to-
gether they groped around under the
seats through the bedclothes and all
over the car but there wasnt a sign of
trousers money or watch

  of course  doc got mad wouldnt
anybody he broke into some fiery talk
and swore hed have justice if he had to
carry the case to the united states su-
preme court and tore around until the
conductor came and tried to pacify him
 by the time they got into the sta-
rr	

                                   

  doc  pants for pants

          f all the tough experiences
in sleeping-cars i ever
heard of the case of doc
hough was about the
worst i guess some of you
fellows have heard of the  doc who
got his title selling patent medicines be-
fore he climbed up into the shirt trade
he blows in here now and then big fat
man with chin whiskers and glasses
frank pomeroy was the story-teller
frank travels after the wholesalers for
a brooklyn woolen factory he was the
center of a group of loungers in the
story - tellers corner in the lobby of
the broadway central that oasis in the
wholesale district where the traveling
salesmen gather by hundreds when the
ending of the road season brings them
trooping back into new york

   the  doc  had only just blossomed
out as a shirt seller and hed fogged him-
self up regardless for his first trip new
clothes from dome to ground-gray der-


the railroad mans magazine

tion the whole train had been searched
for a pair of trousers and the only pair
that could be found that werent in use
belonged to the chef in the diner and
were so small the  doc  couldnt get
into them at all if he had theyd have
fitted him like a pair of tights

   the conductor was for putting him
off considering he didnt have a ticket
any farther that made him madder
than ever

  without any pants on he yelled
not in a thousand years ill stay
where i am till the railroad buys me a
pair think im going to walk up main
street buffalo without em what do
you think i am

     i stay right here till i get a pair of
pants and that goes 

   well the conductor thought it over
and as it was about starting time con-
cluded to carry him on free for a while
for he didnt quite like the idea of
leaving a man with so little clothing on
a platform

   the train rolled on westward and
the  doc  stayed cooped up in his berth
with his knees drawn up to his chin
thinking hard along comes the con-
ductor peeks in at him and says  i
dont want to interrupt your train of
thought but the farther on you go the
farther back you may have to walk and
if i were you id get out

   that was too much for the  doc
he stuck his head out through the cur-
tains with fire in his eye and hissed
through his teeth some language so red
hot that he wasnt bothered any more
with suggestions he hadnt had any
breakfast and he was ready for anything
next to murder

   after a while he began to hunt
through his vest and coat to see if he
couldnt scare up some loose money and
he came across a two-dollar bill that
he had tucked away in a pocket and for-
gotten

   that made him feel better and he
called ithe porter and asked him if he
couldnt get him something to wrap
around his legs so he could get off at
dunkirk the next stop without being ar-
rested

    whats the matter with letting me
have your pants says the doc if
vou will ill send you ten dollars

  what and me go pantless roun
this heah car wif ladies abod not foh
me boss but ill get yo an ole
blanket

   so when they got into dunkirk the
 doc  picked up his grips and with
the blanket wrapped round his legs got
out and headed for the nearest clothing-
store with a crowd of kids at his heels
on the way he did some lightning cal-
culating he felt that he couldnt hold
out any longer without something to eat
and saving out the price of a ticket to
buffalo he would have only seventy-five
cents left for trousers

   if he could get a pair for that price
he could get back to buffalo in time to
hunt up a friend who lived there who
would lend him money and to see his
customers but the best he could get for
his money was a pair of blue overalls
that fitted skin-tight and didnt comc-
down to his shoe tops

   with his gray derby red waistcoat
checked coat and skin-tight short over-
alls he blew into buffalo with a grim
and determined expression on his face
and looking as if hed just stepped off
a vaudeville stage and there he got
another shock his friend was away and
wouldnt be back till night and he didnt
have any time to spare before getting
after customers

   what did he do why he went
around to see the trade just as he was
and he made a big hit too he couldnt
help getting a hearing everywhere togged
out like that and his tale of what hed
been up against put everybody into such
good humor that they gave him good fat
orders

frank gets his man

a nother sleeping  car misfortune
that had a less profitable ending
though it deserved a better one consider-
ing the ready wit displayed was that of
frank peebles a traveling salesman for
a chicago shoe-house

  he had hoped to get a large order
from a retail house in philadelphia but
was disappointed the head of the con-
cern who himself looked after the re-
plenishing of stock was out of the city
and wouldnt be back for several days
w 

told in the smoker	

   the following night peebles was a
 passenger on the pennsylvania special
  that jumped the track and tumbled into
 the river near conemaugh a few years
 ago at the time of the accident he was
 sound asleep in a lower berth he was
 awakened by a crash and the violent
 plunging of the car 

   they were rolling down the steep em-
 bankment into the river and it seemed
 to peebles as he was battered against
 the walls of his berth that the car was
 turning over and over a man was
 pitched out of the berth overhead and
 breaking his fall by clutching the cur-
 tains on the way landed in a heap in the
 aisle directly on top of peebles who at
 the same moment had been tossed out of
 his own berth

    they both lay there for a moment too
 much startled and bewildered to stir
 the salesman was the first to pull his
 wits together glancing up into the
 face of the passenger who lay sprawl-
 ing over him he made a discovery

   why exclaimed peebles youre
 the man i was trying to find in phila-
 delphia i want to show you the finest
 samples in the shoe line you ever saw
 did he get a fine big order he did
 not that was one of the times when a
 brilliant display of business genius went
 unrewarded the man on top of him
 was a serious-minded sanctimonious old
 fellow who didnt believe in talking busi-
 ness in such a crisis

    the young man who will attempt to
 sell shoes in a tragedy of this kind he
 said  does not deserve to be encouraged
 you ought to be thinking about helping
 the wounded instead of your own selfish
 interests

the girl who loved diamonds

 tewelry salesmen more than any
  others are likely to have some stir-
 ring adventures in their travels the men
 who go out from maiden lane are al-
 ways worrying on the road over the dan-
 ger of thieves and a live and pressing
 danger it is one of them charles
 bellinger started out from new york
 to chicago on a new york central train
 a few years ago with diamonds worth
  in his wallet

  at dinner as the train rolled along the
hudson he was seated at a table in com-
pany with a distinguished-looking elder-
ly woman and her extremely pretty
daughter he fell into conversation with
them and it came out that the two were
on their way back from europe to their
home in the west

  then it developed that the girl had
been a classmate in college with bellin-
gers niece during the conversation bel-
linger chanced to bring out the fact
which he didnt often do with strangers
that he was a salesman for a jewel firm
and they began to talk about diamonds
a topic in which the girl showed the live-
liest interest

   they have such an uncanny fascina-
tion over me that i hardly dare look at
them she said  i think theres witch-
ery in such stones

  on his return to the sleeper he ob-
served that the mother and daughter had
berths in the same car as his own

  when it came bedtime he pulled out
his wallet of stones and put it under his
pillow as was his custom that is
where nine diamond men out of ten stow
their gems at night then he crept in
and was soon sound asleep

  long afterward he was awakened by
a movement of the curtains he lay
perfectly still with his eyes half open
watching from between the curtains
something was stealing in upon him
very slowly and cautiously

  bellinger waited for a moment then
grabbed for it and caught it it was a
girls arm

  there was a little stifled scream of
fright a pleading whisper and bellinger
looked into the face of the pretty girl
who had told him diamonds had such a
wonderful fascination over her

  the pitiful look of fear in her eyes
and the thought that perhaps after all
she had been a college friend of his
niece decided him he let the arm go
and the next morning at breakfast she
met him with a bow and a smile as if
nothing had happened

  a few weeks later bellinger got back
to new york and looked up his niece
he described the girl he had met on the
train and gave her name

   why yes exclaimed the niece  she
was in my class in college she had an


the railroad mans magazine

unpleasant experience there too some-
body accused her of stealing some jewel-
ry from a room in the dormitory then
it turned out that her father had em-
bezzled some money out west a few
years before and people were mean
enough to hint that she had inherited
his thieving instincts they couldnt
prove anything against her and she
couldnt have been guilty

  her uncle dropped the subject a
year or two later there was a scandal in
high life over the disappearance during
a house-party in chicago of a diamond
pendant it was found in possession
of a wealthy young woman who had
been a guest at the affair the theft was
attributed to kleptomania and she was
not prosecuted it was the same girl

ludwigs thief

iudwig nissen one of the largest
wholesale jewel dealers in new
york used to travel for a diamond-house
one night just as in the case of bellin-
ger he was awakened in his berth in a
sleeping-car by a hand stealing under the
curtains

  under his pillow was a large for-
tune in jewels and he was wide-awake
in an instant the hand disappeared
he pulled aside the curtains and sprang
out into the aisle but nobody was in
sight

   id like to warn everybody in this
car that there is a thief on board shout-
ed mr nissen

  then he crept back into his berth and
went to sleep he knew there would
be no more danger with the thief scared
and all the other passengers nervous and
on the watch

an inspiration in hats

tt takes a good big inspiration to get
around the stubbornness of some
customers when they make up their
minds they dont want to buy said
charles schaeffer who sells mens hats
to the wholesale trade

   there was old schwartz out in st
louis for instance he was as hard
to budge as a stone wall once hed made

up his mind he didnt want anything
but i did change his mind once id
blown into his city with a pretty fine
line of goods and big expectations and
it made me sore when he turned me
down

    you might just as well not waste
your time with me says he  im not
buying a thing

   at last i managed to induce liun to
come around to my hotel to look at my
samples though all the way there he kept
telling me that i was wasting my time
for he wasnt going to buy when we
got there i pulled out some swell javas
that i thought might fetch him but he
kept curling up his lips and saying
 pooh pooh   at everything i had to
show

   he was glad to stay to dinner with
me though and it was while i was or-
dering the eats that i got my inspiration
a comic-opera company was spending
the week in that hotel and one of the
members of it was a man named cramp
a school-day friend of mine

   catching sight of crsunp out in the
lobby i got after him leaving schwartz
sipping a cocktail it took me about
live minutes to fix up the scheme and i
got back to schwartz just as the steak
was coming on

   pretty soon i noticed that something
out in the lobby had caught the old
mans eye then in came cramp wear-
ing one of my java hats he was a
swell-looking boy cramp was and the
hat was particularly becoming to him
i could see that the old man was im-
pressed

   another minute another handsome
natty comic-opera man passed by with
the same kind of headgear and after a
while two more with my java hats-as
fine-looking young fellows as you could
find and all the time we were eating
they kept hovering around where
schwartz could catch a glimpse of them
now and then

   hed never seen any hats just like
them before for they were a brand-new
line and while he ate his dinner the idea
began to soak into his mind that they
were a fad that was coming in with a
rush

  	 i dont know but id like to take
another look at those javas  he said
told in the smoker



when wed finished and he wound up
by giving me a ten-thousand-dollar or-
der i guess he was sorry afterward
that he did for he had hard work getting
rid of that lot

   next time i- meet him he looks at
me out of the corners of his eyes and
says  charlie its a funny thing to me
that everybody seemed to be wearing
those blamed javas the night i bought
em and that i never saw another before
or after

    well you know fashions change
quickly i told him

torys misplaced gallantry

r i o turn to a more romantic subject a
story told by max kaufman the
road man for a bond street clothing-
house goes to show that a man is wiser
not to force iiis way into other peoples
troubles  that was what tom hen-
nessey was convinced of anyway said
kaufman

   tom had as much of an eye for the
ladies as any man on the road and it
was always getting him into trouble
one time he and i were on the same
train on the michigan central bound
for detroit there was a dapper young
frenchman in our car a few seats ahead

of us and just across the aisle from him
was a good-looking girl with yellow hair

   pretty soon tom got the notion that
the frenchman was annoying the girl by
trying to flirt with her and he got mad-
der and madder about it till at last he
got hold of frenchie in the smoker and
told him what he thought of him

   ive been told frenchmen couldnt
fight but say you ought ito have seen
that one most peculiar scrap i ever
saw i dont know whether he was car-
rying out the methods of his country or
not

   i understand most of em use their
feet over there but he didnt he used
his teeth and his finger-nails and may-
be he didnt do some damage why torn
looked as if hed been tangled up in a
mowing-machine when that frenchie got
through with him tooth and finger-
nail marks all over him

   he pretty near choked the life out
of frenchie to even things up hut there
wasnt much satisfaction in that consid-
ering it would take him six weeks to look
respectable again

  but the worst of it was that frenchie
got the girl after all and you ought
to have seen tom squirm when he caught
one of the disgusted looks she kept
throwing at him being chivalrous to
ladies didnt appeal to him for months

how haight won his medal

it is  trite observation that work on a
railroad nourishes courage grit and
daring is a characteristic of railroad men
charles w haight of utica new york
is a good illustration of the cool-headed
engineer who stepped out of his cab to the
pilot and picked from the rails a three-year-
old child who was about to be run down

  for doing this haight got a medal from
president roosevelt under an act approved
by congress february  

  haight is of stocky build about live feet
eight inches in height and weighs 
pounds he is about forty years old he
talks with a snarl but that  is just his way
haight distinguished himself near west
winfield on april   not far from
the railroad near that village stands an old
house where a family of people lived they

had a large family of children and the
railroad men who traveled that road were
familiar with the place for the children
were often seen at play about the house
and near the crossing such a place en-
ginemen and firemen watch pretty keenly

  haight saw three of the little ones on
the track his train was going at a good
rate he put  the emergency but there
was no hope that the train would stop be-
fore the children were reached

  he leaped through the cab window slid
along the boiler to the pilot and reaching
forward gathered into his arm the three-
year-old youngster who stood bewildered
upon i he track two older children in the
meantime had run from the track haight
was not injured nor was the child hurt-

no -the brief chronicles touching on the ups and downs the
ins and outs and the rise and fall of a con who
rejoiced in the name of jackdaw

his brief chronicle touches a
  few of the high points in
  the career of one j d
  williams

   j d had raven hair
  and more than human

friendliness so we abridged his given
name to the more euphonious and appro-
priate appellation of jackdaw

  he will answer to that convenient call
all the days he remains on the railroad
for no man ever draws a nickname on a
railroad and lives long enough to part
with it

  once upon a time a great many years
ago i worked in a railroad office with
j ackdaw

  heaven bequeathed to jackdaw a play-
ful kittenish disposition the office was
to him what the spring-morning meadow
is to the lambkin or the barnyard is to
the month-old calf

  existence to jackdaw was a constant
round of frolicsome gambols foolish
quips jumbled songs and hodgepodge
whistling until all of us grew weary of
his presence and longed for him to be re-
moved either quietly to some other de-
partment or from the face of the earth
-we did-not care which

   it is a painful and disturbing thing to

ban in tht july  railroad hant aagaiinc

                                              

 be constantly associated with a man who
 is chronically funny

   not a real humorist understand for a
 humorist is often the saddest and most
 silent of men but one who bubbles over
 all the time who finds every trivial inci-
 dent the source of explosive  ha-has 

   one who profanes everything sacred
 with his hilarity and whose rude jollity
 has no respect for the feelings of others

   one who butts in with witless and ir-
 relevant observations who holds you
 long who inflicts you with pointless
 jokes and tells you stories that have no
 beginning no end and no substance

   you find this type everywhere and
 it is no surprise that one of a number
 belonged to the working force of our
 station

   jackdaw had a sort of foolish cheer-
 fulness a certain irrational impromptu
 ill-governed gaiety that irritated the rest
 of us for like all clerks we were se-
 rious-minded and solemnly impressed
 with our duties

   disease death and disaster had no
 terrors for jackdaw he attended a
 wake or funeral with liveliest zest with
 a breezy disregard he bumped into all
 the misfortunes that befell he knew
 neither sorrow sigh nor a regret

                     single copies  cents
observations of a country station-agent 

  he was so persistently and boisterously
funny so inappropriately good-natured
all the time that he maf us weary and
sick of him

  we dissected the fellow in this wise
that he had a good digestion and there-
fore felt physically fit and fine fur-
thermore we put it down and by unan-
imous consent that in the haphazard
chances of birth jackdaw had been
short-changed on brains therefore he
did not know and could not know and
never will know what a nuisance he is to
others constantly running his joy ma-
chine high-gear and without governors

  one summer afternoon jackdaw had
an old car loaded with bone- fertilizer
placed in the material-room of the can-
ning factory and all the girls walked
out

  there was no engine to takb the car
out until the following morning and in
the meantime the idiot actually laughed
his head off over the joke

  this is figurative speech his head
did not actually come off until the fol-
lowing week then it came off neatly
and effectually and that made the whole

affair such a capital joke that all the
rest of us let out an exultant laugh in a
long loud raucous chorus

  the routine of the work settled down
to a decent calm and- we had less ex-
hilaration but better results

  in the office we forgot jackdaw as
speedily as possible his landlady made
numerous inquiries about him likewise
a tailor likewise a laundryman likewise
a florist likewise a-but whats the use

  let all that pass jackdaw was but a
memory which faded fike the crimson
bosom of a fifty-cent shirt

  one hot day in the following summer
we were digging away at our desks bur-
ied in a rush of wdrk when a head
thrust in at the open window and a
mocking jarring voice saluted us

   bend to it grind away you slaves
mush on 

  it was jackdaw

  he had run down to the station from
a freight-train on the siding

   i didnt know any better for a long
time either lean over there hollow
your chests a little more strain your
eyes come back after supper be here


the railroad mans magazine

sunday stay with it heave to al-
together now 

  this deriding taunt drew the duster
and a cake of soap from the interior but
jackdaw ducked and slid back to the
engine he had become a brakeman

  we never knew how he got on or how
he remained after he got on but in time
he became a conductor

  then we all paused long enough to
again recall memories of jackdaw and
to speak the wonderment that possessed
us of how it was possible for any one
with a thought ganglion no larger than
a walnut to be trusted with the respon-
sible duties of handling a train

  in reality we should not have mar-
veled at this for when the personnel of
an organization either railroad or indus-
trial is well known at close range the
same wonderment intrudes itself that
there are so many featherweights all the
way up and now and then capping the
top how they got there and why they
remain puzzle the underling

  but back to jackdaw

  we knew he would be fired soon

  we knew exactly how foolish and
light-headed he was the most generous
estimate of our office gave him but six
months

  jackdaw got into trouble a number of
times and was on the carpet with some
regularity but it is the caprice of the
fates to protect a certain brand of man-
kind known as the fool jackdaw got
through his first year with some scares
and a few scars then we kindly ex-
tended his limit to another year

  that was before the days of tonnage
and freight classification in the yards
trains not so many as now came in with
mixed loads and went out much the same
way

  all that was asked of a conductor was
to have his bills in rotation to corre-
spond with the cars from the engine-to
the caboose

  jackdaw had a green brakeman - a
dutch boy

  by and by they took the siding out in
the country to meet another freight-
train

  when they were in the clear the dutch
boy picked up the bills and accidentally
dropped them on the caboose floor bad-
ly disarranging them

  jackdaw came down with a furious
explosion

  look what youve done he cried
 got them bills all mixed now weve
got to git out and switch this train all
over again to git em in order you got
to be careful when you handle bills
look at the trouble youve made us itll
take over an hour-

  jackdaw actually sent the dutch boy
over to see the engineer and explain that
the train would have to be made up again

  in a little while the new brakeman
came marching back to the caboose

  what did he say demanded jack-
daw fiercely

   he ses you switch dem bills 

  did he yelled jackdaw wait
til i git up there ill tell him a few
things

  at the office we could not decide if
jackdaw was playing a joke on the
dutch boy or if it hadnt occurred to
him to switch  dem bills  until the en-
gineer mentioned it judgment sus-
pended

  anyway jackdaw went overhead and
engaged the engineer in talk

  the engineer was making some repairs
to the engine he- had crawled underwit
when the dutch boy impelled by a lin-
gering curiosity over the affair came up

   go back to the caboose said jack-
daw hurriedly  and get that iron frog
under the seat weve got to have it to
fix the engine its a little heavy but
you can tote it all right hurry now 

  the dutch boy trotted off and in time
came lumbering back with one of those
old-fashioned iron frogs

  just as he reached the tender the en-
gineer came crawling out from under the
engine

   never mind now said jackdaw
 hes got it fixed so you can take it back
to the caboose hurry were going to
git out of here in a little bit

  the dutch boy struggled slowly back
past twenty cars staggering and exhaust-
ed under the heavy load

  that was merely jackdaws playful-
ness they did not need the frog at the
engine but in those rollicksome old days
all green brakemen were put to stunts of
that kind

  old heads recall in their early days
of fruitless quests from yard-office to
observations of a country station-agent 

roundhouse and storeroom for the elu-
sive  left - hand monkey - wrench
 square circles and other legendary
bric-a-brac

  after a day or two by the dutch
process of percolation a thought en-
tered the head of the new brakeman

   what for asked he  i carry dat
frog back why didnt you wait till the
caboose come oop and den put it on
eh

   by george thats so  exclaimed
jackdaw  we could have done that
well remember that next time
germany

  the dutch boy was not as-
sured he thought it over with
native persistence  by lim-
ine he exclaimed at length

you make a monkey of me mitt
a frog 

  with this conclusion the in-
cident closed

  some time later jackdaw
took a passenger on at a way
station bound for chicago with
a car of cattle

  shipments of cattle are usual-
ly accompanied by an attend-
ant who rides in the caboose

  to this one the caboose the
train and the scenery were all
objects of open-eyed wonder-
ment he was fired with the
liveliest interest and asked
jackdaw a string of questions
about each village side-track
and water-tank he was so
verdantly innocent and curious
that jackdaw began to spin
arabian nights yarns

   see that house over there
explained jackdaw- that log
hut by the woods the jesse
james gang surrounded that
one night and robbed an old
miser that lived there of a million dol-
lars see this little town were passing
through aint much here any more but
the sawmill and a few shacks abe lin-
coln was brought up here and worked on
the section right where youre riding un-
til they elected him president

   see that derrick over there thought
it was a windmill didnt you thats
where you git another guess thats the
first oil-well john d rockerfeller ever

dug right theres where he got his
start dug this un with his own hands
too and begged his tobacco while he
done it of that old man that lives in
that shanty there

   see them thickets and that creek
winding around down there thats
where roosevelt comes every year to hunt
rabbits he ort to be there now this is
his time

   by george thats him see that fel-
low over there by the underbrush  
jackdaw pointed excitedly thats him

surer than thunder bill bryan taught
school in this town were passing through
until the year sixteen-hundred-to-one i
think they say then he went to ne-
braska

  the passenger seemed so blissfully ig-
norant and was so importuning in his
curiosity that jackdaw finally grew
weary and decided on another venture

  say germany he said on the side
to the brakeman  lets have some fun

got them bills all mixed now weve got to get

out and switch this train all over again
to git em in order


the railroad mans magazine

the passenger was curious

with this fellow you tell him to watch
me tell him i have fits tell him i
fall over and have crazy spells and for
him to keep his eye on me as i might do
an awful lot of damage

  tell him if he happens to be alone
when one comes  me to get outside
quick and hold the door shut and keep
yelling as loud as he can till some one
comes you clear out and ill have one
of them convulsions ill scare him out
of his boots  

  soon jackdaw went overhead to give
the dutch brakeman a chance to caution
the passenger

  somehow the memory of how jack-
daw had him carry that iron frog from
the caboose to the engine and back came
to him so he told the passenger this

   that conductors a fool he gits
fits sometimes if i dont bin here you
want to watch out for him maybe he
lay you out with a poker you watch
him huh-purty close

   say dont you go away protested
the passenger

    but i got to be out
 some the brakeman ex-
 plained  but i tell you
 what you do if he start
 to have a fit you haul off
 and hit him between the
 eyes - hard as you can
 drive thats what i do
 thats what he wants
 done it jars up his
 nerves then he comes
 out of it and quick too
 dont be afraid shust
 hand him a good one
 hes ust to it if you
 dont he might kill you
 and himself too the
 quicker you land on him
 the better

  when jackdaw re-
 turned the dutch brake-
 man passed him the
 wink then went out on
 top a few cars away and
 sat down on the running-
 board to await develop-
 ments

   the passenger was cu-
rious but sat in silence
he watched jackdaw
nervously

 all at once jackdaw stiffened out with
a sort of paroxysm he fixed his eyes
with a strange hard stare on the passen-
ger he clutched at his hair with both
hands and let out a series of blood-curd- 
ling yells like a hostile chief he fol-
lowed with a few rigid convulsions then
commenced kicking and striking in a
blind frenzy and edging over toward
the passenger

 at this moment all calculations went
wrong jackdaws lights went out
there was a sound in his ears like the
ringing of a blacksmiths anvil the cir-
oumjacence was filled with dancing
moonlets and haileys comet passed so
close that he heard the swish of its tail

 they poured a gallon of water on his
head and let it trickle down his spinal
column

 how many was killed he asked
faintly as he began emerging from the
tunnel

 youre the only one thats hurt an-
swered the dutch brakeman who ap-
peared immediately after the catastrophe
observations of a country st at  n-agent 

   seventy-eight hit us didnt they
how many cars did they smash up has
the wreck-train been called   j ackdaw
was growing stronger  they hit us an
awful smash he must a been turnin
em some i remember it now i went
up through the caboose and come down
in that sheep-pasture didnt i my-
skulls-crushed in-aint-it 

   you been all right purty quick now
assured the dutch brakeman  dev
aint been noting wrong you shust had
one of dem fits youbetter lay down on
de seat a little while and den you be all
hunky 

  jackdaw stretched out as directed and
emitted a series of groans  unsympa-
thetic ears

  the dutch brakeman handed over his
tobacco to the passenger it was the
only token of appreciation he could think
of

  the passenger grinned and rubbed his
 village-blacksmith  knuckles

  it worked bully aint it eh said
he  one biff and i bring him out of
it dats quick medicine by jacks i
never hears of that before

  in course of time the walnut lump be-
tween jackdaws eyes diminished in size
until it disappeared
altogether and so
far as i know the
antidote supplied
by the simple-mind-
ed stockman cured
him for all time of
those sudden vio-
lent spells

  in the office we
continued to won-
der how j ackdaw
held on we had
graciously allowed
him five months
then a year then
two  but he seemed
to come to no bad
end our force
scattered new men
came the old ones
were transferred
dismissed or died
-but jackdaw was
still running a train

  it had been the
unanimous verdict

of our office that jackdaw was a fool and
a failure it hurt our pride and reflected
on our judgment that he kept right on
every month drawing a better salary than
any of us

  by consulting the blue-print of jack-
daws career which went into the future
only a short distance and which reflected
largely on his past performance with us
and was drawn by the master minds of
our office jackdaw should be off-bearing
in a sawmill or responding to some brick-
layers sharp call for  mort

  soon we heard from jackdaw again in
another role

  very early one morning he received a
message from the superintendent to stop
at san piere a way station and pick up
three lady passengers for monticello
which point they wanted to reach for an
early morning connection  another
road

  jackdaw stopped and politely helped
them aboard the caboose

  they were visiting delegates jo some
sort of womans club or association that
had held a district meeting and  high
doings  at san piere the day and night
before

  years ago it was a common thing for

how many was killed he asked faintly


the railroad mans magazine

a freight-train to receive orders to carry
passengers between local stations the
superintendent was appealed to daily by
stranded or belated passengers and he
usually  came across  with the desired
permit

  the practise was greatly abused and
ofteia led to serious complications so that
now it has been almost entirely discon-
tinued

   in functions of this kind jackdaw was
obsequiously polite and with it-being a
fool-he injected his brand of ceaseless
and pointless conversation which like
the woodland brook never stops

  the ladies were hardly seated in his
caboose whenjackdaw began entertain-
ing them with side-lights on the life of
a railroad man

  he told them of its hardships and
privations how for six months he had
not sat down at the table with the  dear
ones at home how every minute he
expected to be killed and taken back to
them mangled and unrecognizable

   the ladies were ignorant of railroad-
ing and being impressionable and tender-
hearted they let out many ejaculations
of surprise and sympathy

   the brakeman was visibly affected too
he fidgeted uncomfortably in his seat
for a while then let out a half-smothered
something that sounded like  well ill
be hanged  can you beat that 

   then he slid out went four cars ahead
and sat down on top to form a picture
of jackdaw at home with the  dear
ones he knew that when jackdaw had
that opportunity he could be found up
to the last minute at caseys pool-room
resort and as for any accident befall-
ing him-they would have to invent some
new processes in railroading first

  one of the ladies noted in a little
memoranda-book the salient points of
jackdaws experiences and they agreed
among themselves that this had suggest-
ed to them a broad field of endeavor for
the womans club for ameliorating the
working conditions of the pour abused
trainmen

  when jackdaw had expended himself
in this direction to the fullest and had
drawn the last tear and the last expres-
sion of surprise he took another turn

    you ladies will excuse me he said
 but im going to prepare a little break-

fast i might ask you to take a bire
with us but i wouldnt offer no lady
what we have to live on i wouldnt
mum  i wouldnt indeed

  yes mum the railroad supplies the
provisions they call em specially pre-
pared rations but i think its only to
dope us so we wont fall over on duty
with exhaustion

    im telling you true mum were fed
worse than the siberian exiles of africa
the stuff the railroad furnishes us aint
fit for eny human bein for food

  but what can we do jackdaw
straightened up in fierce appeal  sup-
pose we quit somebody else would run
these trains it might as well be me go
to my doom as eny one else  jackdaw
uttered this with dramatic self-sacrifice

  he poked up the fire in the cabin
stove then he put on a pan of water
and near it an empty can then he fum-
bled around and brought out the dope-
bucket he jabbed the fork deep into it
and held up the oily ravelings

    yes mum its true said he curling
his lip with disgust  its the main item
of our food supply its furnished by the
company in buckets its the mexican
shredded macaroni in native oils its
made by eyetalians in chenoa mexico
i want you to taste it then youll have
some idea what it is to be a railroad con-
ductor

  jackdaw transferred a pound or two
of packing from the dope-bucket to an
empty can on the stove and set it well
back so that it would not overheat but
simmer gently

   while it was slowly filling the cabin
with a nauseating stench jackdaw got
out a loaf of bread and placed it on a
chair he next brought out the cabin
band-saw and placing his knee on the
loaf deliberately sawed off half a dozen
slices of bread he did this with a la-
bored ripping sound caused by impli-
cating the chair-leg with the bread

    this is not like the bread my mother
used to make he said with a sorrowful
catch-in-the-back grimace then rueful-
ly i never expect to eat anything like
that again they furnish us macedonian
bread made by pneumatic compression
out of soey beans and cactus-fiber

  jackdaw stirred the dope and added
a little salt
observations of a country station-agent 

  then the engine let out a long whistle
and he looked at his watch in quick sur-
prise

   goodness me  he exclaimed
 were there this is monticello im
sorry youre not going farther the ca-
boose will stop right at the platform
yes well come to a dead stop cant
be too careful

  if the lady delegates had looked as
the train pulled out they would- have
seen jackdaw part with his morning re-
past he grabbed his can of mexican
shredded macaroni before it got any hot-
ter and shied it at a scampering cat tres-
passing on the right-of-way near the
depot

  but in time the superintendent received
a long and serious communication from
a certain ladies club it called attention
to the companys barbaric treatment of
its trainmen the road was denounced

for its reckless disregard of human life
reproved for not permitting the men to
see the- dear ones at home and bitterly
denounced for forcing a food supply
upon their men wholly unfit for human
consumption and  inferior to that which
we supply to our domestic animals

 we assure you sir the communica-
tion continued  this fight for better con-

t like the bread my mother
used to make

ditions for trainmen which is hereby un-
dertaken by this club will be carried to
the national body of the continental as-
sociation of womans clubs

  this started something

  there was a neat bunch of correspond-
ence and it all passed to jackdaw for
full explanation

  it came to jackdaw under register so
that he gave his receipt for it and could
not come back with the claim that papers
did not reach him

  jackdaw looked the papers over care-


the railroad mans magazine

fully and a certain ominous tone of the
memoranda from the superintendent to
the train-master led him to the hasty con-
clusion that he was up against some-
thing

  so jackdaw with a ceremony of mock
seriousness touched a match to the pa-
pers and the caboose stove did the rest

 the wind was blowing a gale that
day and a little farther along jackdaw
deliberately fed his way-bills and other
papers to it

  at the next station he sent the follow-
ing telegram to the train-master

    high winds blowed my bills and some
  valuable papers out of caboose near
  mile post  between raub and wa-
  dena north side of track have section
  men recover them and send them in
  on 

  the section-men got instructions and
sure enough they found the bills and
some papers but the correspondence
with the womans club was not among
them strange to say it was never found
although diligent search was made
stranger still there was no resurrection
file numbers and carbon copies were not
used so extensively then as now

  jackdaw congratulated himself on his
cleverness in  putting one over   the

officials by means of a blaze a high wind
and telegram that explained all

  long long afterward i met in the of-
fice the clerk who threw the cake of soap
at jackdaw when he bellowed at us
through the window to  grind away

   spose jackdaws working in the
brickyard by this time eh

   believe me or not i answered
 but that fellows running the package-
local right now

   what   yelled the clerk

  and another long time afterward i had
gone away and had forgotten the-road
and all its associations when one day i
was a passenger on one of its through
trains-nine coaches and five of- them
pullmans

  i handed my pasteboard to a good-
looking conductor in a spick span gold-
braided uniform and as dignified and
correct and courtly as a first lieutenant
in a west point parade he gave me a
look through his gold glasses and a
smile overspread his face

   mush on  he said in an undertone
 grind away you slave 

  it was jackdaw

pennsys steel equipment

what is probably the largest steel pas-
senger-car equipment owned by any
railroad in the world is that of the penn-
sylvania railroad which with the cars
just completed and those in course of con-
struction has six hundred and thirty all-
steel passenger-cars with this large num-
ber of steel cars the pennsylvania railroad
is now to start the operation of all-steel pas-
senger-trains  some of its lines

  on august th  the pennsylvania
railroad announced that all future passen-
ger equipment would be built of steel not
only steel frame but steel and non-collapsi-
ble in every particular in planning the cars
and establishing the standards which are
now copied in all pennsylvania passenger-
cars no expense has been spared to build
a coach which shall provide the greatest pos-
sible strength a steel framing which can not
be affected by fire an inside lining which is
absolutely unburnable

  the pennsylvania railroad in november

 ordered  all-steel passenger-cars
since that time additional orders have been
placed and there are now in service on the
companys lines  coaches  dining-cars
 combination passenger and baggage cars
 baggage-cars  postal cars and one
company car a total of  cars

  in course of construction there are 
coaches  dining-cars  combination pas-
senger and baggage cars  baggage-cars 
postal cars  mail storage cars and ir
baggage and mail cars

  the pullman company at the instance of
the pennsylvania railroad for the past four
years has been at work designing all-steel
parlor and sleeping cars some  such
cars are shortly to be completed

  with the all-steel passenger equipment
now in service or  order and some 
steel cars to be ordered on the  passen-
ger equipment program this railroad in
a short time will have in service about 
of its own steel passenger-cars

         while he was getting his beauty sleep

grsar br  v clicked the train-
           despatchers wire sam ford
           the night-operator at bryan
           lay snugly wrapped in a
           blanket with his head near
           the sounder fast asleep or
           as he would have expressed it  pounding
           his ear

  his call had only sounded twice he
awoke hastily threw the blanket into the
stationary cabinet glanced first at the
clock then at a memorandum on his table

  ford although but nineteen years old
fully realized the importance of handling
train orders being a light sleeper he
had never hesitated to take advantage of
the dulness of the  wee sma hours  to
get some sleep but to prevent mistakes
that might endanger innocent lives he
always kept an  os -a notation of re-
ports of trains passing way stations on
his division

  in his hasty glance at the clock and
the scratch-pad he rapidly calculated
no  wont be here before 
cattle extra  north should be be-
tween navasota and millican excur-
sion extra  should be just ready to
leave hempstead

  ford before giving ok and repeat-

signal-lamp however had become dam-
aged so that even a light breeze extin-
guished it and ordinary lanterns were
being temporarily substituted a white
one stood on the signal-lamp platform
which extended from the telegraph-office
on the second floor to within plain view
of the track when a train was to be
stopped this was taken in and replaced by
a red one

  ford now made this change repeated
the order glanced out of the window to
be sure the danger-signal was properly
placed and burning noted the reports of
these trains on his list and got out his
blanket for another nap

  going to the window he was just in
time to catch a glimpse of the conductor
waving him a kindly greeting as the ca-
boose whizzed by

  horror-stricken for a moment he mut-
tered 

   what is the matter with old collins
on  is he blind


the railroad mans magazine

  more from force of habit than any
hope of enlightenment he turned to look
at his signal-board

   great scott i went to sleep with
that red lantern to stop em now in the
daylight they can only see the board and
thats set clear	

  no  and that cattle will meet on
that curve south of college then that ex-
cursion will smash into that- what
can i do to save those people 

   br br br v commenced the des-
patches

  ford paid no attention to the insistent
calling of the wire but thought rapidly

   they can only run fifteen miles an
hour through the city limits and have two
and a half miles to go before opening up
a horse to catch em at the crossing 

  a searching view of the streets from
the front gallery revealed nothing but the
usual  am deathlike quietude of a coun-
try town not a sign of life of any
kind

   br br br v now rang the train-
wire with an unmistakable tone of impa-
tience

  the operator at  d a wire-testing
office thinking fords instrument on the
train-wire out of adjustment switched
all four wires that ran into  br  togeth-
er so now all four sounded  br br v
in unison

  ford almost fell into a chair and his
head pillowed on his arms he seemed ut-
terly paralyzed

  the phone to college- no chance
i tried that last night on that death-mes-
sage to the principal wire broken

  college station the ordered meeting-
place was a blind-aiding eight miles
south of bryan and three hundred yards
from the a and m college of texas

   br br v rattled the four sounders
simultaneously with a note of genuine
alarm as the despatcher knew no 
should have passed fords station

  id better answer him maybe hes
got more sense than i and can keep em
apart said ford opening his key he
poised his arm for flashing intelligence of
the impending disastrous result of his
carelessness

   br br co came in weak and
hesitating morse from a table in the cor-
ner the only instrument working since
ford had broken the current on the train-

wire until now its weak sound was un-
heard

   the girl she might stop em
without bothering to close the des-
patchers circuit ford ran to the pony
wire built from bryan to the college dor-
mitory by a former enterprising operator-
stenographer employed by the college
president now only used by the operators
in their leisure moments to talk to the new
girl stenographer who was doing her best
to master the language of tire  little brass
noisy as she called it

   if i get her excited she wont be
able to read a word and there is only
about fourteen minutes left said ford
again as he slowly answered

   i i br g m miss nellie are
you up and dressed already 

   sure been out watching the sur-
veyors laying drains she started pleas-
antly

  ford had been racking his mind for a
plan whereby she could stop that train
her words gave him an inspiration

   say ne copy this and dont break
me

   please rush down- to the railroad
pick up that red flag the surveyors use
to lay the drains that is standing near the
gate and wave it beside the track until
you stop that south-bound freight tell
them to get in that siding quick and let
two trains pass north got past orders
show them this message

   ok she started

  ford now fairly snapped out the char-
acters 

   for heavens sake hurry

  she had about ten minutes in which to
make it

  turning to the train-wire he answered 
  i i br v u there

   i i v where you b- the deg-
patcher started angrily

  with forced deliberation ford broke
in

   using lanterns didnt turn board-
couldnt see lantern in daylight got by at
 trying catch em college know in
ten or fifteen minutes if need wrecker
and he closed the wire

  the despatcher made a few dots in an
excited aimless way then evidently
thinking  theres no use bawling that
dub out also closed his key

  ford spent the worst quarter of an hour
ford quits  us ing	

of his life-walking back and forth in the
small telegraph-office at every turn look-
ing at the clock whose hands seemed to
have quit moving	v

   br started the pony wire

  ford was beside it before half the call
had sounded

    i i br

   south-bound train on the siding en-
gineer and conductor both outside my
door wouldnt let em come in their
language is something awful

  ford was so relieved at knowing of the
safety of the trains that he laughed aloud
at this naive description of old collinss
proverbial grouch now accentuated by
the insinuation that lie had run over a sig-
nal

   fine fine little girl please stay by
the wire and let me know when those two
trains north pass

he now called up the despatcher and
reported the safety of the trains adding
heres the day-man  youand he can
get  out of that blind-siding  have
gone to pack my grip

  when the girl told of the passing of
the trains north a message from the train-
master relayed from bryan to the girl at
college notified no  to proceed

  ford returned to the office some two
hours later and calling up the chief des-
patcher asked

   when will i be relieved

   you have already been relieved was
the reply

   ok will you pass me into hous-
ton  

  no walk

   ok g m  replied ford sar-
castically and speaking to the day-man
 losing my job is such a small thing
compared to what so nearly happened
and he shivered at the thought of the aw-
ful scene his imagination so vividly de-
picted  that it seems merely an incident
in the days work hereafter its  five on
a line for me 

  ford went south from bryan

  he did not walk-not exactly he rode
his bicycle for eight miles then it was
abandoned as it was not a tandem

a deaf telegrapher

peter afoley the  lightning taker 
of portland maine is said to be the
most wonderful telegrapher in the world
foley is totally deaf an affliction which
ordinarily would be supposed to make tele-
graphy an utter impossibility but since he
became deaf foley has developed what may
be called a sixth sense and by touch and
sight he can detect the finest movements of
the instrument and correctly interpret them

  his nervous system is a part and parcel of
telegraphy and by the sense of touch in his
linger-tips he takes messages transmitted
from the ends of the continent

  he can also read a message by watching
the sounder with his left forefinger
placed lightly on the sounder he can by his
wonderful sense of touch take a message as
accurately as any man in the office his
feat is said to be the most wonderful thing
any telegraph operator has ever accom-
plished

  mr foley insists that he needs no more
consideration than any operator for he can
read the fastest transmitting without the
slightest difficulty and his record of mis-
takes in ayear is said to be smaller than that
of any other operator in the office

  mr foleys hearing began to fail rapidly
      rr

eight years ago he was then considered
the best operator in the portland office and
every effort was made to help him the
manager of the office arranged the receiver
so it would make a louder tick but in a
short time he was unable to hear even this

  there appeared no alternative but failure
nd operator in the world had been able
to work after he had lost his hearing
the rhanager didnt wish to send a good
man away so he was set to doing common
work at the same salary he had received as
an operator

  one day he announced that he would soon
be able to go back to his old position the
manager was dum founded that a deaf
man could be a telegraph operator was too
much to credit but mr foley was able to
prove that he could do it

 he was soon able to read a message
merely by watching the sounder this was
not the full extent of his achievement

  by many days and nights of practise he
developed such an accurate touch to his
finger-tips that he was able to read and re-
ceive a message in a short time his sense
of touch and sight restored him to the pro-
fession which it had seemed inevitable that
he must abandon

this engine runs backward

latest type of locomotive built for the southern
pacific company which are run cab
first so as to give a better
view of the track

e baldwinlocomotive works have com-
pleted twenty-one consolidation mallet type
locomotives for the associated lines these
are part of an order for  engines placed
with these works by the associated lines in
the spring of 

   the heavy mallet engines have been assigned as fol-
lows three coal-burners for the union pacific railroad
three for the oregon railroad and navigation company
and fifteen oil-burners for tha southern pacific company

   apart from modifications necessary because of the
change of fuel the six coal-burnersare practically dupli-
cates of southern pacific locomotives nos  and 
which were built by the baldwin locomotive works early
in 

   experience gained in operating these engines through
tunnels and snow-sheds says railway and locomotive
engineering has proved the desirability of placing the
engine-crew where a better view of the track can be ob-
tained

    accordingly the new southern pacific locomotives are
designed to run with the fire-box end first and the tender
back of the smoke-box

oil is used as fuel

   with a coal-burning locomotive such a plan would of
course be impracticable but no difficulty need be antici-
pated when using oil as fuel

   in the new design the cab is entered through side
doorways reached by suitable ladders an unobstructed
view of the track is obtained through the front windows

    the cab fittings are conveniently located within easy
reach of the engineman who occupies the right-hand side
when looking ahead the ragonnet power-gear is em-
ployed and its cylinder is located as on the previous loco-
motives it has therefore been necessary to run a shaft
across the boiler back-head in order to make connection
with the operating lever

   this arrangement however in no way interferes with
the convenience of the cab fittings

   the main frames are securely braced under the cab
by a steel casting to which the bumper is bolted the
latter supports a stub-pilot

   the bumper is placed well forward to protect the

               cio
this engine runs backward

occupants of the	cab from buffing and
collision shocks

the deck-plate at the smoke-box end
of the locomotive is of cast-steel and is



the smoke-box for reheating steam be-
tween high and low pressure cylinders
the superheating surface being  square
feet

a better view of the
track can be obtained

 the following are some of the general
 dimensions

locomotive engineering

provided with a chafing-block and a suit-
able pocket for the tender draw-bar the
tender is of the associated lines standard
design with rectangular tank this is
the customary pattern for oil-burning
locomotives

a number being built

  so far as the boiler cylinders ma-
chinery and running-gear of this locomo- 
tive are concerned the design practically
duplicates that of southern pacific en-
gine no  the latter engine has
now been in service a sufficient length of
time to demonstrate its value and the
fact that twenty-one additional locomo-
tives of the same type have been built for
the associated lines proves that the per-
formance of these great engines has been
fully up to expectatipns

chapter i

meeting the boss

incent wilson was
 telling harvey jones
 what he had heard
 something like the sum
 of twenty million dol-
 lars were to be ex-
 pended for improvements

  and said wilson they are to be
paid for out of the earnings of the road
i understand

   what of that said jones

   its a bad idea

   do you dare to criticize the action of
the board as the president of the
mainland system i countenance every-
thing it does

  jones the big burly man of finance
looked at the young mechanical super-
intendent as if he could have killed him
for his impertinence

  but vincent wilson was ever ready
with an answer he had not spent ten
years in the shops without learning some-
thing just entering his thirtieth year
he was one of that great and growing
band of clever americans-the younger
element who see in the future bigger
things to handle both industrially and
financially than their fathers ever
dreamed of

  wilson had studied railroading in all
its branches from school he had gone
to the mainland system apprentice-shops
from which he had been graduated with
all the honors that can come to a young-
ster in such a trying place

  he had worked his way up in every
sense of the word through minor jobs

of grime and grease until he had reached
finally the rung of mechanical superin-
tendent he had saved his money and
he had managed to buy twenty shares of
the stock of the road when the panic
drove it down to 

   this gave him the privilege of a stock-
holder-the privilege of knowing some-
thing of the inside of the great system

  it also gave him ambition the bea-
con of that ambition was that he would
be president of the road some day may-
be it avas a foolish ambition

  but vincent wilson was a man who
had the courage of his convictions-even
when he lost

  he had the courage to speak to presi-
dent jones as he did

  conditions had improved on the main-
land system the panic had subsided
business was coming back to its normal
state the stock of the road was going
up it was now near  any young
man who buys good railroad stock at 
and soon finds it thirty-four points higher
than the purchase price and without any
chance to diminish-certainly feels the
blood of progress in his veins

   in view of the better times the direc-
tors of the mainland system had voted
to spend twenty millions for improve-
ments

  that is what vincent wilson and
president harvey jones were debating
about

    do you dare to criticize the action of
the board  president jones asked again

    it isnt a matter of criticism said
wilson  its a matter of facts twen-
ty millions is too much to spend on the
work we have to do i figure out that it
is not necessary to spend five millions on
president of the line



construction and as for the new rolling-
stock i can cover that with much less
sixty new passenger locomotives will not
cost us more than twelve thousand dol-
lars apiece

  how do you know

    ive been getting figures

   then you mean to infer-

   that theres a leak somewhere  re-
plied wilson with unusual directness

    a leak  echoed the president

   some might call it graft said wil-
son  but  prefer the more polite word
-just now

  harvey jones looked steadily at the
young mechanical superintendent his
jaws slowly set and it was a moment be-
fore he said

   you are making a charge against
some one connected with this railroad
 have it that way if you want to
replied wilson  im pretty well con-
vinced that something is wrong some-
where and when something is wrong
somebody is to blame

  i will talk with you further about
this said the president  i must go to
luncheon at the lawyers club ill be
back at three oclock ill see you in my
office half an hour later

   i shall be there-promptly an-
swered wilson

  the two men parted wilson hurried
over to the roundhouse to inspect a new
mallet compound which the mainland
had purchased for work on its heavy
grade in northern tennessee he had
intended to take her out on the main line
and give her a try that afternoon but the
appointment with the president at 
oclock prevented

   it would be a big feather in his cap if
he could find the leak and he was sure
that one existed it would perhaps be-
come known all over the united states
that vincent wilson had unearthed the
fraud underlying a gigantic trunk line
and his stock would soar-soar so high
that he would be recognized as one of
the brightest young railroad men in the
land a new harriman with greater
things to conquer

  that was what he wanted to happen
as the thought struck him new ambi-
tions filled his being

  he was as one who has hunted long
for gold and finally struck a lead

  and he was sure-so sure that as he
crossed the tracks to the roundhouse he
exclaimed aloud to himself

   i am sure i am sure 

  the headquarters of the mainland
system were in louisville kentucky and
its lines ran down into the rich south-
land through the cotton belt of texas
and on to the west 

  it covered a territory rich in promise
-a territory blessed by nature

  it had employed many men in its va-
rious departments one very unique
character had been for years the head of
its medical department he was dr fer-
guson

  for several years lie had not been in
the employ of the -mainland he had
been retired on a pension

  vincent wilson wanted to see him-
he wanted to see him that day - par-
ticularly before the meeting with jones

  he knew that dr ferguson or doc
as he was commonly called knew about
meriel planquette he wanted to find
meriel planquette

    ill make that crafty old medico tell
me he said to himself

  the doctor had a little office not far
from the mainland systems offices and
a scant practise he was best known now
to medical students whom he coached for
their  exams when he wasnt at his
other occupation-spinning yarns in his
dusty smoke-filled rooms

  vincent knew no time but the present
when he acted he acted quickly-but
with decision

  he hastened to  doc  fergusons
rooms and found him alone he was a
little gray-haired gray-bearded man
with snappy green eyes his tightly
drawn skin over his bony face and hands
bespoke his age he seemed to be a
nervous man-but calmness and coolness
in all tilings held hiirj in check and gave
him what he called  perpetual youth
vincent greeted the old man with cus-
tomary formality and after sparring for
an opening he began to learn the where-
abouts of meriel plaikuette in a some-
what roundabout manner for which he
had a well-developed reason

   i say doc whats become of old
kaintuck he hasnt been around for
ages said wilson

  at the question the doctor grew sud-


the railroad mans magazine

denly grave pulled at his pipe in a medi-
tative fashion and so to speak retreat-
ed behind his eye-glasses

chapter ii
where is the gill

oy he said  you will never see
little kaintuck again

  dead said wilson

  the doctor shook his head slowly
 no not dead lie answered and again
lapsed into silence

   tell me about it doc said the voice
that had first spoken he was such a
good sort in his quiet way

  a picture sprang up before the eyes of
wilson of the vivid eyes and reserved
manner of the young painter whom all
had called  kaintuck because in a
vague way it was known that he be-
longed in kentucky but this fact was
about all that was known of him  for
while being neither ungracious nor un-
popular he preserved around him a cer-
tain delicate atmosphere of reservejnto
which one felt it a kind of violation to
intrude

  no one knew how or where he lived
but that bare existence was a fight for
him it w-as easy to perceive from his fre-
quently worn and almost starved look

  days and even weeks would go by
without his even being seen or heard of
then suddenly he would blow in some
evening with his ivory face the great
black unearthly eyes and the straight
elf-lock that would persist in falling over
his forehead however often he tossed it
back with his frail exquisite hand

  when he was in the mood he could
talk with a vividness that was almost
painfully intense and imaginative and
at such times his great black eyes seemed
like mirrors in which you could see all
he was seeing and telling but his talk
was always impersonal-it told you noth-
ing of himself and when the time came
for breaking up he would suddenly be
gone no one knew whither it was some
such figure as this that wilson saw in his
minds eye as he said  tell us about it
doc

  the doctor took a long time to an-
swer

  well boy he said  ill tell you-

but it is one of the saddest stories ever
told in this sad world

   it was about six months ago the
doctor began  and i hadnt seen him for
days when suddenly one night when i
was quite alone working on some papers
in comes kaintuck-but a kaintuck so
different from his usual self that  hard-
ly knew him

   we all remember how shy he used
to be how quiet-but this night he came
in like a breeze all lit up and laughing
and even boisterous

   my very papers rustled as if the
window had suddenly been thrown open
and the north wind had run its fingers
through them he seemed almost twice
his usual size and his eyes were like coals
of joy in fact to tell the truth i
thought he was drunk - kaintuck
drunk  think of it

  the doctor took one or two draws at
his pipe and presently continued

    kaintuck i said  you seem to be
feeling good whats the matter

    good   he answered  i should
think so doc i am so lonely and i
must tell somebody-so i thought of you
doc ive won the prize and im going
to marry the most beautiful girl in the
world  

  the prize i said what prize
  i know i never told you fellows
anything about myself-but all these
months ive been working on a portrait
of meriel for the competition at the
beaux arts the prize was quite a lot of
money-and doc ive won it shake 
 after i had congratulated him with
all my heart though i was still somewhat
in the dark  said

  but who is meriel you havent
told me that

    meriel he answered is the girl i
have loved since i was a boy would you
like to see her portrait and he drew a
photograph of his own picture from his
pocket it was a lovely face he gave
me a copy of it it stands yonder and
then he opened out and told me all about
himself and his early days

   it seemed as though the flood of his
complete joy had loosened his restraint
and lie talked full and long as i had
never heard him talk before he told
me of his home in kentucky of his
mother of his sister he told me of the
president of the line



privations he had gone through of his
tramping to the district school after do-
ing the chores around the house

   and then he spoke of meriel-how
he had loved her while she was still a
little girl and how even then they had
vowed a childhoods love for each other
i tell you boy it is a wonderful thing
to see a man so happy in the love of a
true woman kept pure by it and sus-
tained in his ideals like poor kaintuck

   as he told me all about it from the
fulness of his heart it took me back ten
years and i tell you it did me a world
of good

  the doctor took a rest for a while and
smoked his pipe in silence while wilson
handed the portrait of meriel  to the
other with murmured remarks on her
beauty touched with a certain wonder-
ing awe anticipatory of the coming sad-
ness at which the doctor had hinted

   come on doc said wilson at
length  brace up and tell us the rest

   well responded the doctor taking
the pipe out of his mouth and proceed-
ing in his deliberate way  he went on
talking of his meriel and the future with
her in a way to break your heart i have
never seen nor ever hope to see again so
happy a man in all this world he al-
most made you afraid-he looked so
happy

   and i may say the doctor added
after a brief consultation with his pipe
 speaking merely as a scientist that
there is nothing to me so marvelous as
the spectacle of pure and absolute joy
it is the only miracle left us-for in-
deed there is nothing to account for it
we fellows of the laboratory who know
what a world we are in cannot but stand
in amazement before the confident hap-
piness of two people in love

   we are all in love in our own par-
ticular ways i grant but there are not
many of us in love like kaintuck i
neednt tell you about it you know the
difference meriel was the only woman
kaintuck had ever loved-you dont need
me to make the distinction

  then smiling he made one of his boy-
ish puns  have you ever thought that
the more you love-the less you love

   go on about kaintuck said wil-
son

   well continued the doctor  i sat

  and listened in envy-listened to every
  word of the transports of his new-found
  happiness  felt i could have listened
  to him forever his joy was like some
  magnetic natural phenomenon-a water-
  fall- a thunder-storm of joy an apple-
  tree in blossom it was so passionately
  elemental  watched it almost as i
  would watch some picturesque experi-
  ment

    then when he had almost worn
 himself out with his enthusiasm i said
  i know you dont often drink kain-
 tuck but this is an occasion  which
 you shall not refuse me  have here an
 old bottle of madeira which it would al-
 most seem  have saved for this occa-
 sion let us drink it together to me-
 riel and your happiness the bottle
 opened we drank the toast and lighting
 cigars continued to talk of the future

    the doctor made another pause then
  proceeded in a still graver tone

     the bottle and the evening were both
  nearly ended lie said  when kaintuck
  rose and taking a cigarette held it over
  the flame of my student-lamp and turn-
  ing toward me said that he must be go-
  ing

  one more drink to meriel-and the
journey to kentucky  i exclaimed rais-
ing my glass he raised his glass too all
the time absent-mindedly holding his
cigarette over the flame

      mind your finger kaintuck  said
  as we drained our glasses youll burn
  it man -and involuntarily i jerked it
  out of the flame-for a terrible thought-
  had occurred to me

      are you a salamander  i said try-
  ing to laugh  are you accustomed to
  hold your fingers in the flames like
  that

   like what i never noticed he
 answ-ered carelessly

      but surely you must have burned
  your finger i said   saw it right in
  the flame

      not at all he said - what do you
  mean  

      do you mean to say it didnt burn
  you   i said

      not in the least he answered

   here it is 

      do you mind holding it in the flame
  again kaintuck i said with ghastly
  misgiving at my heart


the railroad mans magazine

    of course not he answered  but
why should i  

  never mind - it is a whim of
mine

  and then he held his finger-in the
midflame till the flesh shrunk but ap-
parently the fire gave him no pain

    what is the matter   he said
 thats easy i have often done that

    kaintuck  said  do you mind
opening your shirt i want to look at
your chest

    of course he answered  but what
is the matter with you do you want to
scare me tell me whats the matter

   meanwhile he was undoing his shirt
and holding it wide open i looked in

   there were two reds spots upon his
chest

   i feared that i might faint and had
all i could do to steady myself

    you seem to be troubled about those
red spots he said  they are nothing
i have had them for quite a while

   then noticing that i did not speak
and seemed perturbed he too grew sud-
denly anxious

    what do you mean   he said  the
spots are nothing or are they 

   my nerves were so gone that i stag-
gered away from him and sank into a
chair but he stood over me insistent for
an explanation

    tell me he said  what is it-for
heavens sake tell me

    i cannot tell you kaintuck i said
 i havent the courage ask some one
else i dare not tell you

    you shall he said  i am a man
you must be a man too as your friend
i beseech you to tell me

    do you really want to know kain-
tuck i said are you really strong
enough to hear 

    go on he said his face like a
sheet of paper

    kaintuck i answered  god help
you-but you are a-leper 

   great scott  shouted wilson

   the way he took it the doctor con-
tinued  was the bravest thing i ever
saw he stood for a long time quite si-
lent leaning against the mantel then
presently he said  i suppose it is in-
curable doc  

   quite kaintuck i had to force
myself to say

  no hope

    no hope

    and if  were to have children -
and for a moment his voice wavered-
it would descend to them

    indeed it would

   then again lie was silent white and
tense straining every nerve to master his
agony

    think of it doc  he said after a
moment -  think of it doc 

   and at this i confess that i broke
down and cried like a baby for when
he said  think of it it all swept over me
-how he had come into the room buoy-
ant and bright-eyed with the future he
had won the prize he had won his
love i had never seen such a picture of
pure happiness and then to think how
different the world-was to be for him as
he left the room think of it doc
i believe my breaking down helped him
to pull himself together presently he
laid his hand on my shoulder

     dont fear doc he said  ill play
the man but i must be by myself i
need a little time to think it over but
ill see you once more before i do-what-
ever there is to do and then in a flash
he was gone and heaven only knows
what the poor fellow went through as he
walked back to his lonely lodging

  after another pause the doctor re-
sumed

  a week afterhe came back to me
looking about ten years older but cu-
riously calm  doc he said  i have
fought it out i have decided what to
do at first of course there seemed only
one way you know

    but the more i thought of it the
more it seemed the cowards way then
there was meriel and the old folks

    doc do you know anything about
love he said

    not much i answered

     do you think girls get over things
i mean suppose i go away with no par-
ticular explanation dont you think
that might be better than telling meriel
the truth her pride would help her
dont you think if she only thought that
i had deserted her whereas if she knew
the truth her pity might break her
heart

    i believe you are right kaintuck
i said
president of the line



    i think so too he said  but oh
to have to let her think that of me it
is a million times more to me than those
two red spots think of it doc

   after a while he continued  i am
glad you agree with me - for i have
made up my mind i shall give out that
i have suddenly become religious and
that my particular form of religious
mania is to go out to one of the leper
settlements in the south seas-do you
see-to help the poor devils

    they will no doubt think me crazy
-but after all doc he said with a sad
smile  no one can deny that it is a noble
motive and perhaps seriously speaking

i may be able to bring some comfort to
the other poor devils like myself my
fingers can still hold the brush-and did
you ever hear me play the banjo that
will be easy to believe kaintuck sud-
denly developed a loose screw in his head
and went away to entertain the lepers in
molokai tell me-do you think that
will go  

    i guess it is the only way i said
somewhat doubtfully

  but meriel meriel he cried
suddenly throwing his face upon his
arms  i trust this is the best to do-
for heaven knows i do it for her sake 
the doctor paused again to relight his
pipe and then concluded

   kaintuck is now in molokai-he has
been there six months here is a letter

i received from him only yesterday
and meriel asked vincent

   do you want to know very badly
asked the old doctor

   i do i must know

  ferguson hesitated suspiciously then

to be c 

he said   i really dont know in fact
im positive i dont

  quick as a flash vincent wilson
caught the double meaning of those
words

   you do know dr ferguson i hear
that she is a rich woman now and lives
in style theres a reason for it

 is it worth money to you to know 
 that is a matter for my mind alone
i cannot discuss it with you but you
know where meriel planquette is-and
you are going to tell me

  how do you know that i know
asked the old man as he rolled a fresh
pipeful between his hands and smiled
cynically

    your demeanor proves it

   grant that it is so is it worth
something to you-the information
you mean you mean-that you-
have- vincent wilson was getting-
excited he could hardly control his
words

   that i have a price replied old
ferguson without turning a hair

   you scoundrel  shouted wilson

    s-s-h  said the old doctor raising
his finger to his lips  dont get ex-
cited we all have our price in these
days you will have yours sooner or
later

  but for his age vincent wilson
would have floored the doctor

  he calmed himself and then asked

    what is your price 

   five thousand dollars answered
ferguson

   out of the question  replied the
younger man  that is common extor-

jerrit fort the present general pas-
senger-agent of the new york central
lines has made this long hard and creditable
journey mr fort was born in cedar rap-
ids iowa in  he went to work after
leaving school in the offices of the b c r
and n and to quote his own words

   i soon cultivated the idea that my job
was only intended to furnish me with spend-
ing-money and i regarded my monthly sal-
ary somewhat as a rich mans son at college
does his monthly allowance shortly after
my twenty-first birthday i was rudely
awakened by the application of the superin-
tendents shoe to my posterior in other
words i was ignominiously fired

  being a bright young man mr fort fig-
ured that this fact would be known all over
town inside of twenty-four hours and that
he would be permanently disgraced so he
struck out for chicago and obtained a posi-
tion in a railroad office there at fifty dollars
a month the people of his home town evi-
dently had not much faith in him for when-

climbed from the bottom to one
of the most important passen-
ger positions in america

ever he visited home he would be greeted
with such remarks as well i suppose
you have come home to stay now
 thought youd be back before long
 hard to make a living in a big town eh 

  this as xew yorkers would say  got his
goat and he resolved to show these old
cedar rapids folks that cedar rapicls was
not the only place where his brand of indus-
try could be used

  pretty soon he got a position in an audit-
ors office on the wabash railway the
lines east of the mississippi river were at
that time in the united states courts

  the wabash railway had an account with
the wabash western in which the western
owed the wabash railway a large sum of
money the western was not particularly
anxious to settle this account and claimed
that the wabash railway had not furnished
the proper data from which to check the
bills

  by this time young fort had attracted con-
siderable attention from the auditor and the
auditor sent him to st louis to ferret out
the necessary information on which to col-
lect the account at that time freight was
billed only to the coast bank of the missis-
sippi river was rebilled from east st louis
to st louis and therefore lost its identity

  young forts work was to reestablish the
identity of this freight he did it this
was the real foundation of his career be-
fore returning to chicago he was promoted
to the chief clerkship and remained with
the wabash until the receivership was closed
he then came to new york and entered the
employ of the new york central in the
office of the late george h daniells he
was there for eight years and was then of-
fered the secretaryship of the general pas-
senger association this position he held
until  when he was made assistant gen-
eral passenger-agent of the union pacific
at omaha

he held this position until in june 
vice-president daly of the new york cen-
tral asked him to come back to that system

  it is said that men may be known by the
enemies they make of mr fort it must
be said that he can be judged from the
friends he has made-and kept
 tragic train orders

by arno dosch

the block-signal and its attendant devices has removed to a great extent
the nerve-racking responsibilities of operators nevertheless there are
still sections where the fact that trains do not come together and that
year in and year out no lives are lost there is accounted for by the superhuman
vigilance and efficiency of the unappreciated knights of the key

     but there are times when the most efficient of them will have a moments
aberration-in fact it is usually to the most efficient that fortune is most
unkind in their few mistakes-and the result is too terrible to contemplate
we read of men women and children mutilated or killed lying forever beyond
pain or torn in spasms of fearful agony but do we think of the mutilated
agonized soul of the young fellow who has the tragedy of a score of deaths
thrust instantly upon his immature shoulders which are all unprepared to
meet it surely he is the chief of the mourners

one small figure wrongly transcribed may hurl a dozen souls into
the unknown or a minutes forgetfulness may fill a
whole town with mourners

an you stop   

  the wire seemed to
await the answer while
the night operator at
canaan leaned forward
and saw the caboose-
lights on the fast freight disappear
around a curve

  gone anything wrong

  the strained faces in the despatchers
office at concord grew old and haggard
as they listened james bromley their
chief opened his mouth to speak but his
voice caught in the hundredth of a sec-



ond a terrible picture had been flashed
 the camera of his mind

   the whole of his division every switch
every curve the cuts the bridges the
grades spread out before him in a pano-
rama and in the center of it he saw the
quebec express loaded down with happy
excursionists rushing into collision with
the fast freight just north of canaan
the freight making for a siding was
tearing a hole in the night with a string
of heavy cars and when the two trains
met it would mount the passenger and
smash through car after car


the railroad mans magazine

  he turned painfully to the clock and
realized the collision was due

  anything wrong repeated the
night operator at canaan

  bromley spoke in a dull voice

   order out wrecking-crew doctors
and nurses ready to start at a moments
notice

an unanswered query

  anything wrong came the ques-
tion again over the passionless wire

  then the operator at canaan remem-
bered something and he reached up to a
hook as one prepared to take death by
the hand scribbled in his own writing
was a message which had formed part of
a train-order he had given to the con-
ductor of the fast freight    no 
an hour and ten minutes late

  number  he had read it no 
and rewritten it  what lapse in his
mind had caused him to see a four where
he had written a cipher he could not ex-
plain no  was the quebec express
due at his station in seven minutes but
it would never arrive the fast freight
would see to that in-he glanced at the
clock-half a minute

  he seized his head in his hands and
crouched down over the desk shutting
out the clock and the deadly silence of
the night but there crashed through his
head the certain impact of the two trains
the buckling of the coaches the smoth-
ered cries as the heavy freight-cars were
hurled through the broken seats people
he knew were on that train already
their bodies must be jammed and lifeless

awaiting the death crash

  he looked up at the clock again and
it seemed to have stopped but he lis-
tened and could hear the tick the
trains were even then meeting and he
could only wait

  if only it had not been he there was
absolutely no one else to blame he
had made the mistake and he had or-
dered  to go ahead the error had
been discovered when a comparison of
train-orders in the concord office showed
that they had lapped and then-too late
-the question had come over the wire
 can you stop 

  concord knew it was too late when the
message was sent but it was the one
chance

   in anything else a little error such as
the substitution of a four for a cipher
could be corrected but a train-order once
gone is beyond recall the canaan
operator had made the first mistake in his
career but it had snuffed out he knew
not how many lives

  and it was well he did not know by
the time the truth came over the wire he
had a fresh grip on his reason and held
to it while the hst of dead mounted to
twenty-five then to forty-three and the
seriously injured reached first forty
then more than fifty

  while they waited inconcordstunned
it flashed on bromley-the montreal ex-
press it had no knowledge of the dis-
aster and was- burning the rails south-
ward frantically one of the men threw
open the key and called station after sta-
tion but from each came back the an-
swer   gone and in each sat an
operator realizing that there was an ini-
pending catastrophe but knowing only
vaguely where or how

steel cut like cardboard

  the operator at canaan heard the
calls and the answers and he knew what
it meant added to the collision with
the freight which must have already
strewn the track with the dead was to
come the rear-end collision with the
montreal express killing those who had
escaped the freight

  when the crash came between the
quebec express and the freight the en-
gine-crews had just enough time to throw
on the brakes and jump as they leaped
the huge locomotives broke each other
like cardboard boxes leaving the track
clear for the solid freight-cars to hurtle
through the coaches the smoker was
completely demolished  and in the sec-
ond car where all faces were turned to-
ward a man who was singing the seats
were ripped out from end to end leaving
a trail of dead and unconscious excursion-
ists

  the buckling of the third and fourth
cars threw frank ryan a brakeman as
from a springboard and he fell bruised
and stunned beside the track in the
tragic train orders	

dark some one stumbled against him
bringing him back to consciousness and
he seized the leg as it passed over him
but he could only lift one arm and all
the lower part of his body was useless
as he fell back a head bent over him
and he gasped faintly

   montreal express-right behind-
fast train-no signalman for heavens
sake stop it 

  he fell back unconscious again while
the passenger whom he had seized in the
dark ran up the track not knowing how
he was to stop the train intent only on
going as far as possible while he ran
the dawn broke and the engineer of the
montreal express peering ahead saw the
stumbling reeling figure down a piece of
straight track and heeded the wildly wa-
ving arms

the anguish of suspense

  when this the canaan new hamp
shire wreck of september   hap-
pened every operator on the division was
suffering agonies of apprehension before

the crash came the fact that it had
not yet occurred but was inevitable only
made the pain more keen

  no wonder their faces habitually wear
a serious concentrated look vigilance
and wakefulness are the watchwards of
the profession and yet most operators
are at small stations where particularly
at night they have little to do when all
the world is asleep they must remain
alert through the length and breadth of
the land keeping trains out of trouble
and preventing delay

  as a train rushes past a forlorn little
house by the side of the track all the
passenger thinks is that he is glad he does
not live there but it is to the faithful
performance of duty on the part of men
who are willing to live in such places
that he is able to pass over two or three
states while he sleeps

  during the night his safety has been
in the keeping of dozens of these men
but he wakes in the morning without
appreciating the fact that if a single one
of them had failed in his responsibility
his journey would have ended in tragedy

 montreal express-right behind-fast train-

the railroad mans magazine

  one of the most efficient trainmasters
on a splendid system of railroads ex-
plained how he was given a sense of his
responsibility at seventeen he was night
operator at a small station in ohio and
everything had always gone well his
job seemed more monotonous than any-
thing else and it never occurred to him
that the passengers in all the trains which
passed by his office were placing an un-
expressed faith in him and expected him
to watch while they slept

  late each night two trains passed
down the second meeting an up train
at the station below one night in hot
summer when he had not been able to
sleep well for a week he received an or-
der to hold the second train at his sta-
tion he stepped out to set the signal
just as the first train was passing and
leaned his head against the door to enjoy
the cool breeze it created

the knife of responsibility

  the train pounded along then there
was quiet and again it began to pound
along when it became quiet a second
time he awoke-too late while he had
been asleep standing up the second train
had passed and somewhere between his
station and the next there would be a
collision he jumped to the key and
rapped excitedly-

   hold no 

 gone replied the operator below

  the two trains were headed toward
each other each making time for the
connection at the next station the boy
pictured the wreck as vividly as the oper-
ator at canaan and he wanted to run
and hide but he only got as far as the
station platform where he stopped and
strained his ear against the silence of the
night as if to hear the impact miles
away

  he waited fifteen of the longest min-
utes that ever dragged their weary sec-
onds and then he saw a light coming
down the track at first he thought it
was a survivor hobbling in with a lan-
tern  but it was steady and advanced
rapidly it was the down train coming
back the engineers had each seen the
other train and come to a stop

   thats my nightmare the train-
master said it was thirty years ago

but whenever i am tired those trains
rush at each other all night through my
sleep

blameless man who fled

  he did not run but it took nerve to
stay and face the expected horror more
than one operator has found it too much
foi him john lynes a boy working as
night operator at volland kansas on
the rock island was one of them

  the wreck was no fault of his but the
horror of it alone was enough to drive
him out in the country as far from the
railroad as he could get in a night of
running hoping that the sight of man-
gled bodies would cease dancing before
his eyes and the shrieks of the injured
would die out of his ears

  the horror pursued him he could
not run far enough to escape he did
not know it but he was fleeing from the
terrified cries of men pinned into their
seats and burned there

  this tragic order was properly re-
ceived and executed but the engineer dis-
regarded a part of it for a reason he never
had a chance to explain as he died first
a south-bound passenger which ordi-
narily waited at alta vista the station
beyond for the passing of two trains was
ordered to wait at volland on this night
of june  

  lynes received the order stopped the
train and gave the order to the engineer
after he had returned to his office one
north-bound train passed and imme-
diately after it he heard another sur-
prised that the second train was so close
he glanced up and saw that it was going
the other way the south-bound had
waited for only one train

  at one leap he was on the platform
with his lantern but although he swung
it as hard as he could the train went on
so he swung it again even more violent-
ly and then he saw that the light was
out

lyness desperate efforts

  twenty yards down the track the
pumper was walking away his lantern
on his arm lynes made a dash for him
racing beside the speeding passenger
which was already going too fast for him
to climb aboard the last car was

whirling past when he caught the	sengers in one car as they lay helpless

pumper and wildly waved his lantern	but conscious jammed between the seats
but no one saw as a last chance he

hurled the lantern itself at the rear door	pursued by a horror
of the train but it broke on the coup-

he knew what would happen half-	otherwise he might have lived the life

   youll have to catch me before you

way to alta vista there was a long deep
cut on a curve where the trains were cer-
tain to meet in it the engines would
pile up and be thrown back on the crum-
pled cars as the tragedy was borne in
on him he fled running stumbling over
fences through brush across fields in a
mad rush to get as- far away as possible

of terror through which will thurston
went after he had caused a fatal wreck
on the fitchburg

  thurston was night operator at ayer
junction and was a very careful man
an amputated leg and several fingers
missing after freight-wrecks when he was
a brakeman had made him so he knew
what it meant for a train-order to go
astray

  one night in  when there had


the railroad mans magazine

been a tie-up he was ordered to stop a
freight to make close connections with a
belated passenger but other messages
following he did not have time to set
the signal immediately in those days a
lantern alongside the track served the
purpose of a semaphore at danger and
when there was a train to stop thurston
had to pick up the lantern and carry it
out

  on this night a few minutes after he
received the order and had straightened
out a number of tangled matters he
heard the freight coming and uncon-
sciously was listening to hear it stop
instead it pounded right along through
rushing out to see if the lantern was
still lighted he was surprised not to find
it at all

  the train had passed  the wreck was
certain unless he could stop the passen-
ger running back to his office to call
up the next station he seized the key
only to find his worst fear realized

  nerveless and stunned he turned

around and there stood the lantern in
the corner he had not put it-out on the
track

  after the crash when they were open-
ing the track for the relief-train ayer
junction failed to reply to all messages

  years afterward leonard johnson of
west pollock new hampshire-who in
bills day had been sheriff but was at
this time on a pleasure trip to texas-
recognized a familiar back on the streets
of el paso

on the shoulder only to see him jump
with marvelous agility for a one-legged

man landing in the middle of the street
gun in hand johnson stopped surprised
and looked on the worn frightened face
of bill thurston

  whats the matter bijl he asked

   dont make a move replied bill
 youll have to catch me before you can
take me back  

  when johnson explained that he was
not wanted for any crime that the wreck
itself had been almost forgotten bill
drew an easy breath for the first time in
years he told johnson that he had been
living in dread of arrest ever since that
night a footstep in the hall would
waken him in a chill and any one brush-
ing by his shoulder  the street turned
him cold

  many an operator who would have
liked to run away and forget everything
has stayed by his post and ended with
nervous prostration one of the living
tragedies which remains after a wreck has
been cleared away and the victim either
dead or recovered is the despatcher who
has been so badly shaken by the horror
of it that he has never had the courage
to send out another train

  it may not have been his fault but the
fact alone that he issued the order which
ended so disastrously is enough to take
away his nerve to many despatches
a big wreck means the end of their rail-
road careers all the notable wrecks
have victims of this kind one which
has left the staff of operators intact is a
subject for comment

disaster beyond conception

  the most remarkable case of this kind
occurred in the middle west following
what was probably one of the worst head-
on collisions that ever happened it was
a dozen years ago but it is fresh and
green in the memories of the men who
lived through it their names or even
the road and the state would recall it
all too vividly to those who would like
to forget and even the number of the
dead if printed would point too definite-
ly to the occurrence

  there was a west-bound passenger-
train which was ordinarily on time but
on this tragic night had been increased
by eight cars to carry a party of excur
sionists consequently it was late al-

though it had an extra engine and the
despatcher anxious to put through an
east-bound on time gave orders for it to
wait at a station just east of the division-
point

  in giving the order he did not take
into consideration the fact that the west-
bound had had the right of track for a
good many years and was not accus-
tomed to be stopped except at important
points and sent the east-bound out be-
fore he had heard from the west-bound

clearing the operator

  the operator at the point of delivery
was a new man who had just been sta-
tioned there that day but he carried out
his instructions to the letter that the
signal was properly displayed there was
no doubt as the section crew returning
from work took a little more time than
they otherwise would have getting off the
track seeing that the train had to stop
the comments among the gang regard-
ing the signal stood the operator in good
stead later when the dead were being
counted by the score

  why the train passed there is no tell-
ing there were several theories at the
time the most persistent of them being
that each of the engineers was busy and
each was relying on the other to keep a
lookout but neither of them had a chance
to explain afterward

  when the double-header rushed by the
station the new operator realized the dan-
ger  the instant and was able to get
to the door of the tower before the sec-
ond engine passed it was just at dusk
when his lantern barely showed and he
saw immediately he was not noticed
without a moments hesitation he threw
the lantern at the stooping figure of the
fireman but it went directly over his
back out the other side and crashed on
the ground it was all over then

the torment of purgatory

  the operator stepped inside his tower
again to watch it go he knew how long
the east-bound had left and strained his
ears to hear the impact but first he
went to the wire and told the despatcher
what had happened

   as i am sending this he rapped


the railroad mans magazine

 i expect any second to hear- the
sudden break was eloquent of what he
had heard

  those who were in the office of the
despatcher saw him spring to his feet
and stand like a frightened animal nos-
trils dilated head high and attentive
he was listening too all stopped work
and watched him

  far across the prairie-almost five
miles it was-they faintly heard a deto-
nation it might almost have been a box
falling in a distant room but they knew
better to the despatcher there was no
doubt whatever

  such a wreck as he was sure had hap-
pened was enough to wake the country-
side the only reason why the operator
at the point of delivery heard it first was
because he was nearer sound travels
fast but to the mind of the despatcher
it came on leaden wings

  in the moment that the crash was re-
sounding in his ears he realized where
the trams must have met both were on
the down grade going not less than for-
ty-five miles an hour

 the double-header had comparatively
light engines while the east-bound was
being hauled by one of the biggest pas-
senger-engines on the road he could
imagine the heavy engine knocking off
the lighter ones and attacking the passen-
ger-coaches one after another how
many it would smash through it was
spared him to know-then

  the sound died away and the oper-
ators in the office continued to stare at
him as the only point of inquiry to
him their look was  accusing his eyes
suddenly flashed with a mad light his
two fists came down with startling vio-
lence then all at once he wilted as
they continued to stare he looked around
with unseeing eves and walked out of the
office

the thirst for vengeance

  they looked at each other as much as
to say  well never see him alive again
all the time they did not understand
what the trouble was as he had taken
the message himself but they could see
calamity spelled in mighty big letters on
his face

  they wanted to rush out to save him

but immediately there were other things
to do it was not half a minute before
they knew what had happened and with
a wreck on their hands almost unprece-
dented in the history of railroading they
had time only to think of the work in
hand

  the whole town went into mourning
there was not a soul in it who had not
lost a relative or friend feeling ran
high and there was a strong disposition
to place the blame on some one and make
him suffer for it

  the operator at the point of delivery
made his statement and was corroborated
by the section-hands but this rested the
burden on the two engineers of the
double-header and they were both dead
men gathered around street-corners and
talked it over excitedly and gradually a
slow anger arose against the despatcher
for issuing the order at all

  even the railroad officials criticized
him although he had only done his duty
in attempting to get the west-bound away
on time he was the only living person
on whom the mob could wreak vengeance
and it was loudly proclaimed that it
would not be healthy for him to show his
face in that town again

what a man did

  while the excitement was at its highest
he came back went to his office and took
up his duties as if nothing had happened
the coolness of the action and the look
of terrible suffering on his face dis-
armed all criticism and there was not a
hand raised against him he is still des-
patcher at the same division-point and
gradually the resentment against him has
died out leaving in its place a respect for
his courage

  suffering on account of a lapped train-
order for which he was not directly re-
sponsible has fallen to the lot of many a
railroad man the case of charley par-
ker one of the best-known conductors on
thenew york central has attracted
more than the usual amount of attention
as he has lived it down according to
the rules he was responsible for a wreck
equally with billy murray the engineer
but he only did what many a conductor
has done relied on the engineer to follow
out train-orders
tragic train orders



  they were running the fast sleeper to
montreal over the delaware and hud-
son along the picturesque route by the
shores of lake champlain when they
were ordered one night to wait at wills-
borough for a fast freight the order

man he was given a passenger-train
again he keeps his eye on all train-
orders now

  the same train which was wrecked on
this occasion carried signals one night
for a light engine which went to a tragic

all stopped work and
watched him

was delivered several stations down the
line and parker giving it to murray as
usual thought nothing more about it

two men who forgot

  unfortunately murray forgot and
went through willsborough without stop-
ping parker busy collecting tickets did
not notice and the first he knew of the
lapped order was when the trains met

  parker was held responsible and dis-
missed from the service but several years
later he was taken back as brakeman
and after serving eight years in that ca-
pacity and several more as a baggage-

end a freight was waiting on a siding
but neither tom durmody its engineer
nor  chalk  barker the conductor saw
the green light or heeded the customary
whistle as soon as the passenger passed
they pulled out upon the main track and
began to make time around the many
curves with a string of forty-five cars
behind the light engine was on the pas-
sengers schedule

  the operator saw the freight pull out
but knew nothing about the light engine
until he saw it rounding a point three
miles distant at the same time the
freight was rounding the point from the
other direction and neither could see the


the railroad mans magazine

other although both lay in plain view of
the operator helplessly watching them
fascinated by the imminent catastrophe
he stood holding to a lever in his tower
hoping that they might stop in time

  even before they crashed a sick feeling
swept over him and he was afraid he
would faint so he hurried to the wire
and sent out word of the wreck before it
happened as he finished he looked up
and saw the light engines headlight
flash high in the air as both engines
plunged down the mountainside when
the wrecking-train which lie had or-
dered came they found him unconscious
on the floor of the tower

  to deliver an order and after it has
run its tragic course to sit as judge and
fix the responsibility rested as a duty on
a despatcher who now handles two hun-
dred trains a night he was day oper-
ator and station-agent at a little town in
the coal regions of ohio on a portion of
the ohio central

  mining had ruined the water in the
neighborhood for engine use and three
or four strings of cars were kept busy
supplying water for the whole district
from a stream above reacleville the
town was on the grade and the water-
trains used to tear through it the water
chugging about the tanks and sending
the train ahead faster and faster

  it was before the general use o air-
brakes and the operator kept as close
watch on the uncontrollable trains as if
they were mad bulls one day a freight
was due at about the same time as a
water-train so he sent word up the line
for the freight-conductor to keep watch
and if the water-train was behind to
have his rear well guarded

  the freight drew in and the conductor
informed the operator that he had
dropped a flagman a mile up the track
who was to walk half-way and be picked
up by the water-train it sounded safe
but they did not know that the flagman
had decided on his own hook to ride on
the rear platform of the caboose until it
reached reacleville and then walk back
a hundred yards up the track

  almost immediately they heard the
water-train whistling for a crossing just
above then they saw the headlight but
as it was turned directly on them they
could not tell how fast it was approach-
ing they thought it was stopping but
it was in fact bearing down forty miles
an hour

  the flagmans hundred yards was past
in a jiffy and the caboose was struck at
full speed splitting it directly in two
at each particularly stubborn obstruction
in a freight-car the tanks surged forward
and pushed the engine through two or
three more cars until the freight was
eaten to pieces

  the flagman saw there was no use for
him to remain around that railroad lon-
ger so he walked into the split caboose
picked up his clothes-and was just leav-
ing when the operator collared him

   before you go the operator said
 you are summoned to appear before my
court and give your testimony it lies
between you me and the con and youve
got to exonerate us its bad enough to
kill an engine-crew but youre not going
to cost one of us his job

  what remained of the two train-crews
formed a jury found the flagman guilty
and the operator passed sentence order-
ing him to fade away

what a little inside knowledge did when an expert track-builder
received an offer from the railroad magnate

 a man frequently betrays a good deal	cost some years ago that it is expensive to

of bis character by his unconscious	have any individual eccentricities that might

personal peculiarities said sir william c	be noted by casual observers and taken ad-
van horne recently to a group of his vantage of by them if they knew their
friends at dinner  t found out to my meaning
hired by van horne	

  sir william is the overlord of many
thousands of miles of railway some of
them are in the far north-like the great
canadian pacific system which he built
and others in the lands of perpetual sum-
mer-like the roads that gridiron the island
of cuba in between are many other
leagues of track over which he may have
his private car or special train hauled free
by simply signifying his wishes to the opera-
ting department

  in his travels sir william is always on
the lookout for good men-competent and
reliable subordinates-the men who can do
things-and he personally engages a great
many in nothing do his personal peculiari-
ties stand out in greater relief than when
he is negotiating with these that is the
feature of the story that he wept on to
tell about himself

   some years ago said sir william  i
bought a line of railroad in michigan and
as soon as possible went down from canada
to make a tour of inspection of the prop-
erty as i was riding along i saw some
pretty fair cnstruction work on a railroad
that paralleled my line here and there-a
competing road that had just been finished

the ubiquitous smith

  who built that road-bed over there
i asked some of the local gentlemen who
were accompanying me

    why that is some of smiths work
they replied

  forty or fifty miles farther along i
noticed as pretty a piece of bridge building
as i ever saw-just about perfect i asked
who did it and got the same reply

 smith after another stretch we ran
alongside the competing line again and a
long fill with a big culvert in the middle
caught my eye

   it was beautifully shaped up and down
in a first-class workmanlike manner that i
could not but admire again i inquired
who did it  smith was the answer and
so it went

   whenever i would notice anything par-
ticularly good it would always be smith
that had done it smith i learned was
the chief engineer of construction on that
property and was a man who worked tire-
lessly and well

   i made up my mind that we needed
smith on some new work that we were
going to do-work that required the highest
degree of skill so when i got back to my
office i wrote mr smith asking him to
come and see me at his earliest convenience
on a matter of importance

   now smith was a wise young man-so
i learned afterward it seems that lie had

an intimate friend in toronto and this
friend also knew me pretty well-in fact
he knew some things about me as it turned
out afterward that i didnt know myself
so when smith got my letter he came on
to toronto and before seeing me went to
call on his friend and showed him my
letter

    what does sir william want to see me
for he asked his friend

    to offer you a job what else did
you suppose his friend replied

    how much do you think i ought to
strike him for

  what have you been getting

    six thousand

   what would you go to work for him
for 

    i think i ought to get about nine thou-
sand

pointers on sir william

    now ill tell you what to do said
smiths friend confidentially you go over
and see sir william and draw him out
talk along with him and watch him very
closely dont let a single one of his
moves escape you he has some very
marked peculiarities when he is hiring a
man like you and if you observe closely
you may be able to gage just how much he
will stand

   after you have been talking a while if
sir william gets up from his desk and walks
around and sits half-astride the first chair
he comes to keep away from the question
of money until you see what he is going to
do next if he gets up and goes back to
his desk and settles down there nine thou-
sand is the top price he will pay

    if he gets up in a minute or two and
commences walking up and down the floor
make it twelve thousand and youll get it
dont be too hasty about naming your
price even while he is pacing the floor
though for there is still another thing that
he is likely to do if you get him up to the
top notch of enthusiasm

  if he stops and perches on the big
table with one leg tucked under him you
may know that youve got him up to the
limit lie can afford and you can make your
salary fifteen thousand and he will agree
to it 

  sir william paused here and took a sip
of water no one spoke for a moment
then one of his guests who could restrain
his curiosity no longer inquired

   and how much did you hire him for
sir william

  sir william van horne sighed then
smiled

the tragedy of the tower

by james william jackson

      the troubles howard got into through a mania for
      holding up his superiors and how he was cured

half-mile of railroad track
straight away to the left
glistened in a scorching au-
gust sun waves of heat
sucked in filmy curls out
of the steel bands before
the parallel rails disappeared around the
sharp curve

  a way-freight crawled slowly and re-
luctantly up through the blinding glare
to the sweltering little country station
near the signal - tower some sleepy
empties were to be drilled from the siding
and replaced by loaded cars

  howard the boyishly slight young
operator yawned wearily as he glanced
out of the window and observed the en-
gineer of the freight hanging from his cab
and puffing languidly at a corn-cob pipe
while he waited for orders

  it was not a bracing outlook howard
listlessly curled his arm on the table and
laid his head down heavily he remained
so when j oe smaltz the freight conductor
came puffing hard up the steep stairs of
the tower and waddled his pudgy two-by-
four body across the room

   mistake this for a hall-bedroom of a
summer hotel howard  joe quizzed in
a genial voice  or did you just quit
your job and forget to notify us before
you went to sleep 

  howard lifted his head without the
trace of an answering smile

   tuckered out and disgusted joe he
explained  been up i dont know how
many nights

  joe wiped off his tobacco plug care-
fully with the cleanest part of his jmnper
sleeve took a generous bite and patted
down the gashed end of the plug before
he restored it to his back pocket

  hows your boy tom he de-
manded then sympathetically

  howard put his elbow on the table and
twisted his dark-skinned attractive face
out of shape as he leaned his full weight
on the upreaching hand his eyes looked
unseeingly out of the window and he
moved his head in a slight shake

   the doctor doesnt promise any-
thing he said in a despondently low
tone  i-i was up with the kiddie all
last night and the night before his
mother is down sick now no luck at all
joe-and no money whats worse i
wont have any job by to-morrow

  he suddenly flopped his head back into
lils curved arm burying his face from
the sight of the kindly conductor joe
drew close

   prayin boy he inquired fearfully
as he put a grimy hand gently on the
brown head of the young fellow  oh 
he observed in a tone of relief  it
sounds a little like cussin that shows
theres some spunk left but it wont do no
good see here now well all stand by
you after your jobs gone dont lose
your nerve

  joe had been turning over his quid with
nervous concern now he spat through
the open window a distance of a track
and a half  pete wants to get over on
the down track he reminded changing
the subject suddenly

  howard rose obediently and with a
deep-drawn sigh to throw open the proper
switch joe gave him another fatherly
comforting pait and left him he turned
his attention then to the levers while the
clanking puffing engine and the rattling
freight-cars drilled back and forth but
in the momentary intervals between throw-
the tragedy of the tower



ing the rails he leaned his elbow against
the window-frame and stared at the floor

  home matters would have alone justi-
fied his despondency but there was the
further fact that he was momentarily ex-
pecting an order of discharge and a suc-
cessor in the tower-house

   it had all come about through a blunder
in carrying out instructions the strain
of his boys sickness and late hours had
made howard stupid-a little careless no
doubt and unfit for
continuous accuracy

  nothing had hap-
pened to life or prop-
erty because of his
blunder his own
instant correction of
the fault had pre-
vented that but the
finest express on the
line had been held

up

  unfortunately the
president was aboard
with some western
railroad potentates as
his guests the vis-
itors had marveled
for a while at the
skilful handling of
the road and after-
ward had twitted the
chief because the flier
had been stalled by
a cow of a freight
which had  busi-
ness to be where it

was

  ordinarily the
error would have
meant thirty days
suspension but the
president had been
warmly disturbed by the irritating defec-
tion on the prize division howard had
already learned in a roundabout way that
his discharge was seriously contemplated
it might come any minute every click
of the keys startled him into expectation
and every stranger was mistaken for the
new operator

  the superintendent of the division had
come up on the freight finishing an
errand in the station he came into the
tower and busied himself writing while
the drilling went on

  howard attentive to the demands of
the freight was pulling and pushing the
levers to manipulate the cars hither and
thither the train was late the superin-
tendent eager to get up the line  and the
men conscious of his presence hustled
almost recklessly to finish and be gone

    theyll trip a car off the track first
thing they know though howard mut-
tered  the way theyre smashing things
back and forth

the crew had sent the consignment
along the down-grade siding

  the siding ran down from the village
crossing and ended only where the tower
squarely blocked the way the empties
had been withdrawn and four heavily
loaded flat cars of bridge timbers were
making ready for a flying switch from the
main track to the siding while the
engine in obedience to a quick throw of
a lever kept the main way the ponderous
cars would speed down the run of track
toward the tower-house

  if they smash this tower again as-
they did last year howard mused  ill

have company when i start out to look for
another job

  too much haste in just such an opera-
tion the previous spring had carried the
end of a shifting freight right over the
solid barrier built between the track and
the tower howard could recall the
picture as vividly as if it had happened
only yesterday

  he could see in his minds eye the litter
of the demolished tower and the wreck of
the cars spread all over the down track
that track had been out of commission for
nearly a half day

  but the signal-bell was ringing and
with a sigh as his ever-recurring thoughts
reverted once more to speculation concern-
ing his boy and his future prospects how-
ard turned to answer

   it was the block call for an express just
now somewhere up around the curve which
hid the signal-post from view howard
dropped the arm of the semaphore to
show an open way in a minute or two
more the heavy line of cars-all pullmans
-would come thundering with mighty
tread past the tower and with a screeching
whistle for the lower crossing howard
could hear the distant blast of its coming

  at that moment there was a yelling
order or two up at the crossing the com-
mingling racket of hoarse voices bumping
cars and shrieking brakes seemed to jar
on the nerves of the absorbed superin-
tendent

   what are they trying to do with that
old rattletrap of a clink-clanking outfit
anyway the irascible chief demanded
in a far-away voice and with wrinkling
forehead  do they think they are hav-
ing a wake 

  howard turned his glance curiously
toward the freight-engine the man at
the hand lever had let the timber-cars in
on the siding and had quickly thrown
back the arm to keep out the engine just
as howard expeoted the crew had sent
the consignment along the down-grade
siding with a hurry rush

  the haste had irritated joe smaltz it
was his bellowing voice that helped to dis-
turb the superintendent the picture of
smaltz waving striped-jumper arms in
wild rebuke and shouting at the top of
his voice brought a faint smile to how-
ards face

  the brakeman on top of the cars was

falling all over himself in his eagerness to
cut out some of the senseless speed how-
ard turned whimsically to the superin-
tendent

   theyll bump both the tower and the
corporation pretty hard if they dont slow
up soon he observed

  the chief muttered something irritably
but went on with his writing without
turning to look howard continued to
watch interestedly

  the brakeman on the timber-car had
scrambled with stumbling haste at joes
hoarse command toward the end of one
car he jammed his short stick in a brake
wheel and sent it whirling around it
fetched up hard and fast suddenly the
man was a giant of a fellow with unusual
strength

  wow howard ejaculated in spite
of himself the seasoned stick had
snapped oft short the brakeman was
hurled backward by the unexpected acci-
dent the wheel spun itself loose instantly

  with the brakeman lying flat on his
back out of control temporarily the leap-
ing cars ran wild their speed undimin-
ished only a short distance now inter-
vened between them and the tower and
howard knew they were bound to strike
with the annihilating force of a tornado
the tower would be a heap of kindling-
wood in another moment

  big two-by-four-square joe the con-
ductor appreciated the danger also he
could see howard at the window  get
out  he yelled wildly his arms going up
and down like an insane semaphore in
mad gesticulation

  howards ejaculation and the medley
of yells at last brought the superintendent
to his feet but before he had quite turned
to observe for himself howard passed on
joes warning jump quick he
shouted in an excited pitch of tone

  the deep rumble of the oncoming cars
and a half glance at them satisfied the
superintendent the tower door was wide
open a leap from the outside platform
might mean a broken leg but it would
doubtless save from something worse

  howard was close behind the super-
intendent the cars would strike in an
instant the tower must certainly collapse
it was only a question of how completely
either of them would escape going with it

  just then howard heard a sound that
the tragedy of the tower



the sides of the tower
instantly collapsed

not only startled him but also brought to
his mind again sharply the incident of
the previous spring

  it was the whistle of number eight
about to swing around the upper curve
she would come flying by the tower in a
second or two bringing her luxurious
hotel coaches along at a forty-five-mile
clip and as certainly as death the down
track would pile up with wreckage before
she could pass

  the smashing of the tower and the
freight-cars would be as nothing compared
with what threatened after the big tower
toppled over in front of number eight
and a car or two piled up on top to add

engineer would see and with instant sus-
picion diminish speed a second-a half
second more-and it would be too late

  all this did not go through howards
mind in so many separate concepts how-
ever it was all like one flash of a
biograph

  the superintendent was in the very act
of leaping while howard for infinitely

weight to the obstruction the express
would augment the heap of wreckage with
a twisting crashing pile of timber steel
and snuffed-out lives

  the train had not yet passed the signal
when howard heard the whistle he
realized the importance of that fact that
signal told the engineer to come right
along at top speed if the block were
raised at once it might not suffice to stop
the express but there was hope that the

less than a breath of time balanced his
life against the fate of the express

  as the superintendent sprang over the
railing howard turned with a whirl and
jumped back to his levers he struck at
the right one by a blind instinct without
ithe thousandth part of an inch of lost
motion

  the lever went back before his hurtling
weight and with it went a prayer that it
might not be too late

 last he crawled with a littlfe pulling help
 out from his prison to the glaring sun-
 shine in the shade of the storage-house
 he sat caressing an egg-shape bump on
 his head and surveyed the scene

   as he had mentally prophesied the
                   tower and freight-cars were more or less
                   piled up on the down track number
                   eight panting hard
                   stood with her nose
                   pushed into the de-
                   bris like a dog in-

 you seem possessed
with a mania for in-
terfering with the
movements of your
superiors

  he heard the barrier
at the end of the siding
track smash the rumbling
cars leaped the wreck he felt
the tremor of their closeness then
there was a mighty roar and a crash
lurching over on top of the lever which
raised the blocking signal against num-
ber eight he felt the terrific shock
and heard the scream of the tower
when the heavy cars rent its body
apart

  the sides of the tower instantly col-
lapsed the floor sagged in time with the
settling roof sheathing lining and fra-
ming timbers folded up like paper-boxes
or shut up on themselves like jack-knives

  in howards mind however was the
live consciousness of a quicksavage whis-
tle from number eight apparently enraged
that the way should have been closed
against her so unexpectedly then the
broken bones of the stricken tower closed
in around him and made him prisoner

  it seemed to kill him and bury him with
the one action in the general wreck of
the building which had been squeezed
into a shapeless mass much as an orange
might be crushed to pulp in a strong
ruthless hand he was as a mere seed of
the fruit gouged aside

  there was a pandemonium of voices as
freight crew and villagers set to work
digging him out from the maze of
splintered and stabbing timbers howard
grunted his relief and gratitude when at

quisitively searching for a bone the
passengers had thronged out shuddering-
ly for an inspection

  just then howards attention was at-
tracted by the approach of a gray-beard-
ed distinguished looking personage it
was the president of the road to save
his life howard could not refrain from
a broad grin as he struggled respectfully
but painfully to his feet this was the
second time within a week the chief had
been delayed on this division

   young man the president greeted
him with apparent sternness  you seem
possessed with a mania for interfering
with the movements of your superiors

  such defects are usually indicated by
leakage when the engine is in service they
are shown by a little water or steam oozing


the railroad mans magazine

at the point where the defect exists when
the engine is cold a slight collection of in-
crustation or rust on the outside of the
boiler will show that there has been a leak

  a defect in the fire-box will often be
shown by a leak at the mud-ring when a
fire-box plate is cracked it usually opens
suddenly so that the leak shows at once
flues are liable to leak when there is no
other defect excepting that they need calk-
ing but when this is done the flue-sheet
should always be examined to see whether
it is cracked

  internal corrosion or grooving unless it
has become so serious as to cause an ex-
ternal leak cannot be discovered except
through an internal inspection of the boiler
to do this the dom e-cover must be taken
of and a person must go inside of the
boiler and carefully examine every part
which is accessible to make a thorough
internal inspection all of the flues should be
taken out

  when water is of a corrosive character or
contains much solid matter which is de-
posited inside of the boiler such an inspec-
tion should be made frequently but when
the water is pure it is not essential to do
it so often our personal opinion is that even
in the presence of good water conditions
all of the flues should be removed at least
once in two years

  two green flags by day and night and in
addition two green lights by night displayed

the front of an engine denote that the train
is followed by another train running on the
same schedule and entitled to the same time-
table rights as the train carrying the signals

are any roads in the eastern states
l running trains with electric locomo-
tives

  	what is the length in miles of these
roads

  	what are their names and where
located 

  	what is the pay for engineers running
these trains

  	do you believe that electric trains
will shortly be substituted for steam on the
eastern railroads-ii w c brooklyn

    and  the new york new
haven and hartford railroad from new
york to stamford connecticut about 
miles the new york central from new
york to high bridge and to north white
plains about  miles and the baltimore
and ohio from camden station baltimore
through the belt-line tunnel to mount royal
station are the three prominent illustra-
tions where this power is applied to all
classes of train service

  	the pay for engineers is the same
as  the steam roads about  per day
of one hundred miles all over one hundred
miles to be paid for in proportion we
cant say exactly what the rate is on either
of the three roads mentioned but in pas-
senger service it will be found to approx
imate closely to this figure freight-rates
are somewhat higher generally four cents
per mile

  	no we never did think so and
developments of the past few years have
not brought any change in this opinion in
a recent report of the electrical commission
of the state of massachusetts we note the
following from mr c s mellen president
of the new york new haven and hartford
railroad which is of much significance in
view of the fact that this road is more
heavily involved in electric transportation
than any other

  we believe we are warranted in saying
that our electric installation is a success
from the standpoint of handling the busi-
ness in question efficiently and with rea-
sonable satisfaction and we believe we have
arrived at the point where we can truthfully
say that the interruptions to our service are
 greater nor more frequent than was the
case when steam was in use but we are
not prepared to stale that there is any
by the light of the lantern



economy in the substitution of electrical
traction for steam on the contrary we be-
lieve the expense is very much greater

   in a recent editorial comment the rail-
 road age-gasetle says

    it may be accepted as conclusively
demonstrated that the new york central
and the new haven roads are moving trains
by electricity more economically than they
moved them by steam in their suburban dis-
trict to enable this to be brought about
however extremely heavy capital costs had
to be assumed and the charges on these capi-
tal costs make the entire operating cost in-
cluding overhead charge far higher than it
used to be in the days of steam operation

   it is quite apparent after an entirely dis-
 interested study of the general situation that
 the problem of electrification will be ap-
 proached if not with actual timidity at
 least quite gingerly by the large railroads
 electric operation as compared with steam
 shows to greatest advantage in urban and
 suburban passenger service and it is viewed
 with sufficient confidence in that direc-
 tion to warrant its gradual introduction but
 from the present outlook there is little
 likelihood of its supplanting steam for
 trunk lines and especially in freight service

if vision is sufficiently acute for the require-
ments of the service no objection would
likely be made to the use of glasses merely

why can an electric locomotive start
much faster than a steam one 

       	a claims that the engineer of a
steam locomotive can make a quicker start
with hfs train than is usually in evidence b
insists that if started any faster than the
usual practise the engine would be strained
please explain this-v v z kansas city
missouri

  	electric locomotives are generally
built with every axle directly driven by a
motor and thus the total weight is made
available for adhesion this naturally re-
sults in a more effective start and more
prompt acceleration than in the instance of
the steam locomotive where the power is
transmitted through the medium of rods

  	starting a locomotive is much de-
pendent on the weight of the train and the
condition of the track not to mention
schedule requirements it is impossible to
strain the engine in the sense which b views
it if too much steam is admitted the wheels
will simply slip without doing any harm in
particular except that the fire may be torn
you can safely depend  it that all locomo-
tives you have seen started were properly
put to work under the conditions present at
the time and which of course were duly
weighed by the engineer

  would advise you to ask at the informa-
tion window in the union depot at kansas
city in regard to your third question which
we did not include above we are of the
opinion that the numl r is nineteen roads
but our record is hazy

when the pennsylvania railroad com-
mences operation with its electric
locomotives where will they be un-
coupled from the train and the steam engine
put on - will they keep the depot which
they now have in jersey city after the
change


the railroad mans magazine

  	how does an oil-burning locomo-
tive operate dp they have burners the
same as an oil stove how many gallons
of oil does the average oil-burner use in an
hour

  	how many gallons of water does
the average compound locomotive consume
in an hour	-

  	will electricity ever take the place
of steam locomotives or the mono-rail the
place of the two-rail track-c f e new
york

  	so far as we can learn the plan
under consideration at present is to cut the
steam locomotive off the train at harrison
new jersey and use the electric engine
thence to sunnyside yards  long island
that is in either direction these points will
mark the limits of the electric zone it is all
conjecture so far in regard to the present
depot in jersey city rumor has identified
the erie railroad with it after the pennsyl-
vania vacates but this is scarcely probable
as the erie is at present spending a great
amount of money in the vicinity of its own
jersey city terminal the lehigh valley
and the new york susquehanna and
western are tenants of the pennsylvania at
jersey city but it is the intention of the
erie to accommodate the latter road in its
jersey city terminal and the lehigh valley
has scarcely sufficient passenger business to
warrant taking over the entire pennsylvania
terminal if any decision has been reached
in this matter nothing has been given out
as yet

   	irrespective of the difference in fire-
box arrangement to burn oil instead of coal
the oil-burning locomotive is in all other
respects similar to the coal-burner there is
some difference in the size and shape of
burners but as a rule only one burner is
employed having a slot in the end about 
inches long and  inch wide to which the
oil flows from the tank

  the oil emerging from the slot is ignited
and comes in contact with an atomizing
steam-jet which spreads the blazing globules
into a roaring fire the latter is rather in-
termittent in action and therefore hard 
flues and fire-box subjecting them to vary-
ing temperatures

  we cannot answer your question relative
to the gallons of oil consumed per hour as
this would be dependent on the size of the
engine and the conditions under which it
was working the tanks carry from 
to  gallons and these sizes are sufficient
for a ten-hour or longer run with a freight-
train

  	would depend upon the size of
engine weight of load and speed there is
no such thing as an average compound
engine they are supposed to be more

economical with water than a simple engine
quantity would vary with conditions

in fitting connecting-rod brasses a con-
tends that the brasses should be fitted
so that when the key was driven the
brasses would meet brass and brass without
pounding b argues that the brasses should
be fitted so that the two halves will be -
of an inch apart when the key is driven

  	a argues that the actual horse-
power of an engine cannot be ascertained
without an indicator test or subjecting the
engine to a brake test bs theory is that if
the stroke and diameter of the cylinder aud
the boiler-pressure is known the horse-power
can be calculated-w m winnipeg

  	a indicates the best practise and the
one generally followed especially in the in-
stance of heavy power in addition to his
correct view care should also be taken to
allow a little clearance where grease is
used as a lubricant instead of oil this is
by the light of the lantern



because the pin must warm up slightly to
start the grease running and all brasses
running  pin grease are always warm in
comparison to those on oil-hot almost

  this clearance in the bore of the brass of
say - of an inch on a large main pin
will take care of the expansion mentioned
and which without it would likely clamp the
brasses  the pin with the usual result
there was a time years ago when power
was light and better work done on engines
when brasses were filed as b suggests but
such a practise in the present day when
engines are run in the chain-gang and de-
prived of the care of regular engineers
would prove most disastrous

   in this instance b has the better of
the argument as with the figures known it
is not necessary to resort to the tests men-
tioned horse-power is the product of the
force multiplied by the distance through
which the force moves in one minute
divided by  in the case of a two-
cylinder simple engine it is to be found by
multiplying together mean effective pres-
sure the length of the strokein feet the
area of the piston in square inches and the
number of strokes per minute dividing the
product by  and squaring the result

 	that time-honored custom puts him
  the right side is about the only answer

   	r r

we can give it would be as difficult to say
just why as to explain why so many british
and foreign engines have the engineer on
the left side and why their general practise
is to run their trains left-handed where-
as ours uniformly run  the right-hand
track when you walk on the strand you
turn to the left while on broadway to the
right

  it appears more to the point to have the
engineer  the right side of the cab in this
country as we run on that track and all
signals and stations are on that side of the
track assuming of course a double-track
road the engineer can make better station
stops and better water-plug stops than if
the reverse was the case it is a matter of
little moment about the levers etc as they
can be handled as rapidly under the present
arrangement as though  the other side
at all events this particular point could
never attain the prominence of being an ob-
jection

   this form of smoke-stack for use
on wood-burning or bituminous coal-engines
was in extensive use before the innovation
of the extended smoke-arch since then
they have fallen into general disuse as the
smoke-arch proper now catches and retains
the sparks which work was formerly done
by the peculiar internal arrangement of the
diamond stack itself

  this smoke-stack consisted of a central
pipe and a conical shaped cast-iron plate
called the cone or spark deflector which
as the latter name implies was intended to
deflect the motion of the sparks and cinders
so as to prevent them from escaping into
the open air while incandescent or  alive
a wire netting was also provided intended
as a sort of sieve to enclose the sparks and
cinders and at the same time allow the
smoke to escape these were removed at
the end of the run through a hand hole at
the base of the stack

  this general arrangement was cumber-
some and unsightly and when it was found
that a simple arrangement of netting within
the smoke-box would serve to accumulate
the sparks within the latter and permit the
use of a straight stack it was generally
adopted

  	this is evidently a form of outside

  cause they absorb so much heat it may be
  said that their use so far has been largely

  rc b pomona california-in view of

  	the fact that freight-cars are inter-
  changed all over the country a lock  the
  v doors would be of little value in protecting
  the contents because of this interchange
  there must necessarily be a multiplicity of
  keys and besides the lock would have to
  be standard the present car seal is better
  if the train is carefully inspected at each
  division point according to rule its condi-
  tion will indicate to within one hundred
  miles or less the territory where the car was

entered on the other hand a lock could be
just as readily locked as unlocked and the
car might go two thousand miles after be-
fore a robbery was discovered

why are engines on fast through trains
changed at the different division
points does the time required to oil
the engine have anything to do with the
changing or is it due to the fact that the
bearings are heated-c e l san jose
california

  they are changed frequently because
after a hundred miles or more the fire be-
comes dirty and there may be an undue ac-
cumulation of sparks in the front end both
of which conditions operate against steam-
making i addition to this if the run was
prolonged additional coal would  doubt
be necessary if not men would have to be
placed at designated points to shovel ahead
the coal remaining  the tender so that the
fireman could reach it without handling it
twice all this requires time and money

  if an engiae is run over two divisions in-
stead of one which your question implies it
places it in the hands of two-crews on the
one run as each crew runs only on its own
division this dividing responsibility for
the engine has not been found to work out
very well in practise

  up to recent date the erie railway
ran the same engine through from jersey
city to susquehanna pennsylvania about
 miles although the crews were changed
at port jervis new york- miles some
years ago the southern railway ran the
same engine from alexandria virginia to
danville virginia  miles the crews being
changed at charlottesville virginia 
miles from alexandria the atchison
topeka and santa fe once ran the same
engine regularly between winslow arizona
and albuquerque new mexico  miles

  all of these however have abandoned the
practise in favor of the shorter division and
to keep the engine in the same hands while
it is  the road the question of oiling
has little or nothing to do with it it is
not a fact that the bearings are hot as your
letter suggests if everything is running all
right there is no more liability of a hot bear-
ing in two hundred miles than in one
hundred

when weary wanderlust writes

the signs and symbols which enable the wandering brotherhood of
boes to size up the inhabitants and railway
chances in a wayside village

a small station in the far west was
once presided over by a young woman
miss ethel waters she was prepared for
the boes that continually floated down the
pike in her direction always meeting them
with a pleasant word and guiding them on
their way with a pleasant smile but one
day her faith in mankind received a severe
shock a weary wanderlust with a romeo-
and-juliet disposition drifted along after
resting and chatting for a while lie began
to pour out a stream of violent love to the
lady-agent at first she laughed but willie
was deadly serious

  his outburst became so violent that she
had to call in a freight-hustler who wasload-
ing a near-by box car in a few minutes
weary wanderlust was doing his familiar
pirouette along the tics his young romance
had died a sudden death

  however the next morning when miss
waters came to open up she w-as surprised
by a sign that had been drawn on the door

   who put that there  she asked an early
operator as she glanced coyly at the marks
she felt were meant for her

   the tramp that we threw out yesterday
was the reply given with exaggerated pity
for the supposed love-sick swain

  miss waters smiled believing the sign to
be the last love-message of her admirer from
hoboland to her the sign seemed to be a
heart pierced by two arrows of course
there is a distinct difference between a real
live unwashed hobo making ardent ad-
vances to one and such romantic long-dis-
tance talk as this therefore miss waters

let the sign remain but what she really be-
held was this

it was not a heart but a circle that was
pierced by the two arrows and among free-
riders that signal means  get out of this
town quick as possible

tramps have many other signs for in-
stance when a man fresh from the rods is
confronted by this

on a sign-post or fence in or near a railroad
yard it means  yardmen here all on the
watch-out

gang in next town get off here

signals that are perfect

by peter mulligan

for nearly three thousand years the semaphore has held a proud place
in the communicating facilities of the human race at the present
time the millions of traveling human beings and the billions of dollars
worth of commerce that it guides and guards give the slender ash-blade a
unique position in the story of our development but in spite of its past
service and present preeminence it would seem as if the day of its decline has
arrived electric signaling has been followed by electropneumatic and this
in turn by cab signaling until one might easily believe that the time is near
when a deaf dumb and blind man can run an engine with perfect safety if
not with speed	

things that have happened and are happening tq make railroads
the safest place in the world and how signaling has pro-
gressed until it is both signaling and controlling

he first semaphore was used
 in greece before the birth
 of christ with the aid of
 its long blade a system of
 optical telegraphing was
 carried on which flashed
 messages from hill to hill and a code de-
 veloped which was used on the mediter-
 ranean down through the middle ages
 at the time of the french revolution
 it had come into common use in northern
  europe and the prussian system of the
 early nineteenth century necessitated the
 use of four blades permitting four thou-
 sand combinations

  but after the invention of the electric
telegraph the semaphore would have
been forgotten if it had not been for its
value in signaling trains many other
forms of signals were tried before the
semaphore was adopted as the standard
for railroading the most common of
which was a disk half solid and half per-
forated giving it the appearance of a
waffle when the disk showed the solid
portion the road was clear when it re-
volved so that the perforated section ap-
peared the traclfc was busy

  sir charles hutton gregory was the
first to think of the use of the semaphore




the railroad mans magazine

in connection with railroads and he
erected one at charing cross in 
the blade was placed at the top of a pole
as at present but it waj not balanced
and normally hung down at  clear un-
less the signalman pulled it up with a
cord which he fastened about the pole
with a slip-knot

the first semaphore

  when the danger had passed he loos-
ened the cord and the semaphore dropped
down since that tune the horizontal po-
sition has always indicated danger and
the vertical clear

  from this crude device has developed
the whole intricate system of modern sig-
naling other forms have been installed
but none have stood the test of compari-
son and the semaphore has long since
come to be recognized as the standard
it has held its position undisputed until
now when the recent developments in
cab signaling threaten eventually to do
away with it altogether

  in the beginning the signal was used
merely to show a time interval there
was no means of knowing how far a train
had progressed until it reached the next
station and then only if there were a tele-
graph operator there the practise was
to show a danger-signal until a train had
left the station five or ten minutes ac-
cording to its speed then indicating
 clear trusting to luck that the train
had kept going rear-end collisions
were common in consequence

birth of block signaling

   the necessity for greater safety caused
the early development of block signal-
ing the idea then as now was to di-
vide the track into sections or blocks
never permitting more than one train on
any one block

  under permissive signaling this rule
is regularly violated  but the principle
involved remains intact although its ap-
plication is not strict men stationed at
switches and irregular intervals were the
original dividing-points at which blocks
ended and began but tuey soon gave way
to definite markings the operator at the
farther end of the block telegraphing
back when the block was clear the

trains waited at the entrance to each block
until the conductor or engineer had re-
ceived a written message giving him per-
mission to proceed

  this system was well enough as long
as the traffic was not heavy but it re-
quired too much track for each train to
be economical on a busy road the first
development with the purpose of secur-
ing speed was the distant signal invent-
ed in the early fifties and erected as an
experiment at meadowbrook near edin-
burgh

 distant  blade arrives

  this proved so successful that it was
soon generally used it was placed down
the track in advance of a station and
gave the engineer information whether it
was safe to enter the block in which the
station was located

  the distant signal was made almost
from the first with a  fishtail or  swal-
lowtail to distinguish it from the home
signal which was square at the end
like the home signal it was operated by
hand a long wire extending down the
track to the semaphore pole connecting
with a crank which lifted the blade as
the distant signal was often out of sight
the signalman was by no means certain
that the blade had fulfilled its function
when pulled the home signal he could
see and correct if it failed

  for many years all signals were worked
by hand the lever came into use in-
stead of the handle on the end of a wire
or rope but no mechanical appliance was
found successful for a third of a century

  electricity was suggested as early as
 and was put into operation on the
eastern counties railway but electrical
appliances were so uncertain in those days
that a disaster arose from its use in 
which caused its abandonment a signal
which should have gone to danger failed
to work something going wrong with the
current and two trains collided with a
loss of more than twenty lives

electricitys bad start

   electricity was at once set down as un-
reliable and the horror of the tragedy
hung over the railroad world so long that
it was not tried again for many years
signals that are perfect



then the plan was revived to some extent
in america

  when the change once came the gap
between manual signaling and automatic
signaling was made at a leap the old
system with a man working both home
and distant signals with a lever con-
tinued in operation with hardly an im-
provement until  when the first
automatic was placed in operation on the
eastern railroad of massachusetts now
part of the new york new haven and
hartford

the science revolutionized

  this brought about a revolution in the
whole science of railroading instead of
having a man with the lever do the work
the train passed over a track instrument
which lay close beside the rail and was
pressed down by the wheels of a passing
train

  as the track instrument was depressed
it operated a bar connecting with a crank
at the base of the signal-post turning it
so the signal went to danger as the
train passed on and out of the block con-
trolled by the signal the track instru-
ment arose the bar shot back and the
blade dropped to  clear

  the track circuit system has since en-
tirely superseded track instruments john
d taylor of chillicothe ohio took out
the first patent on an electrical signal
and tried it at cincinnati in  al-
though it was quite successful from the
beginning it was not taken up extensive-
ly until  when taylor had secured
sufficient capital to manufacture on a
large scale now all automatic systems
are operated in part by electricity

combining two systems

  the principle of the electric automatic
system is simple a current is generated
beside the track at one end of the block
and communicated to one of the rails it
passes from rail to rail through the fish-
plates and special bonds placed there for
the purpose until it reaches the end of
the block where an insulator between the
ends of the rails prevents the current go-
ing farther

  a wire at that point connects it with
a relay in the form of an electromagnet

through which it conveys the current to
the other rail of the track the current
then passes back through the second rail
to the generator

  when there is no train on the block
the electromagnet in the relay is ener-
gized by the passing current and an ar-
mature through which the current passes
is held tight to the magnet the arma-
ture will remain where it is unless some-
thing short-circuits the current and as
long as it remains the home signal which
is operated by the current through an-
other electromagnet in the signal - box
will be at normal

how it works

  as soon as a train strikes the rails the
wheels pick up the current of electricity
in the track and send it from rail to rail
across the axle instead of by the longer
route through the relay-box a portion
of the current continues to pass through
the relay-box however but it is not
strong enough to hold up the armature
which drops

  when this happens an armature in the
signal-box also drops making another
connection and causing a different cur
rent which sets the machinery in the
signal-box in operation

  all systems are not the same but the
principle of breaking the circuit does not
vary in all the dropping of the arma-
ture creates an opposing current which
actuates the machinery enclosed in the
signal-box

  in the case of the home signal which
is at clear the dropping of the armature
sends a current into the signal-box which
energizes various cogs and cranks mov-
ing the blade to danger in some systems
there are two armatures in the signal-
box one a clutch inagnet which pulls up
the signal by the strength of its clutch

cannot go wrong

  when the train passes off the rails and
out of the block the current through the
relay is restored the armature is lifted
and the current in the signal-box is cut
off the whole mechanism is immediate-
ly deenergized and the wheels in the
signal-box are revolved in the opposite
direction by the weight of the blade


the railroad mans magazine

which having nothing to support it falls
back to its original position

  in the normal danger system the blade
rises to vertical and falls to horizontal
in a normal clear system it rises to hori-
zontal and falls to vertical it depends
upon how the blade is fastened to the
post

  the distant signal is operated in the
same way but it receives its current by
the passing of the train on a more dis-
tant portion of the track perhaps in the
fourth block beyond the train entering
the block with which the distant signal is
connected short-circuits the current and
causes the armature to drop simultaneous-
ly with the home signal at that point

  the new current created by the drop-
ping of the armature communicates the
trains approach to the distant signal sev-
eral blocks ahead and it flies to caution

   as the train passes into the next block
it picks up the same current again and
although the train passes out of the first
block the current is maintained by the
corresponding relay in the next block
and so on until the train reaches the block
at which the distant signal is situated

  as each distant signal reaches back
through several blocks a multiplication
of relays is needed these are provided
for all in one relay-box in each block by
adding an electromagnet for each addi-
tional distant signal

would work any distance

   in practise distant signals do not give
notice of a trains approach more than
four blocks distant but it would be pos-
sible to do it over a much greater stretch
of track

   as soon as the train has passed into the
block at which the distant signal is sit-
uated and passes out of the preceding
block the current which operates the dis-
tant signal is shut off and it falls to its
normal position by gravity

  in a double-track road there is much
itss complication of wires and relays than
on single tracks where trains are travel-
ing in both directions if the signals
were communicated only from block to
block on a single track a head-on col-
lision might occur at the entrance to any
block as the distant signal only indicates
caution and the engineer does not bring

his train to a stop until he sees the sema-
phore on the home signal at danger

  to avoid this risk the signals overlap
into the adjoining blocks a trains ap-
proach not being heralded from the time
it enters the block but half-way into the
block ahead at the warning the train
which is in sight of the home signal comes
to an abrupt stop and the other one
which is slowly approaching is brought
to a standstill as soon as it sees the home
signal at danger

one blade for several signs

  the customary arrangement of having
two signals on each post-the top one for
the home signal and the lower for dis-
tant signal has been modified in several
new systems installed one blade doing
the work of two instead of the upper
blade remaining unmoved and the lower
one operating while the train is approach-
ing and the upper operating and the
lower dropping as the train enters the
block the single blade moves to an angle
of forty-five degrees for caution and to
horizontal for danger

  the mechanism is not radically differ-
ent where one blade is used instead of
two there is in fact an economy of
power and where it is being used it has
been found to be more effective than the
double system as it leaves no room for
confusion in the mind of an engineer on
a road where there are several tracks

  in a normal clear system the home sig-
nal remains at vertical at all times when
the track is clear in a normal danger
system it remains at danger all the time
until a train enters the block in advance
and then it goes to clear additional wi-
ring is necessary to communicate the
trains presence in the block ahead but
otherwise the system is not different from
the normal clear in both systems the
semaphore-blades which are made of ash
and are light balance so as to fall to
danger if anything goes wrong

same principle in both systems

  the greatest care in the making and
installing of the semaphore systems is
needed as they are left to operate by
themselves and receive only the occa-
sional attention of the maintainer and
signals that are perfect



batteryman faulty construction must
be avoided  but this is not difficult as
there is only comparatively simple ma-
chinery in the signal-box which alone
could prevent the signal falling to dan-
ger

  if the wiring should be defective or
any accident occur to the batteries or re-
lays the semaphores would all go to- dan-
ger and remain there

elaborate endurance tests

  at the factory of the hall signal
company at garwood new jersey the
first semaphore made by this company is
still standing in the testing-room all
about it are dozens of other semaphores
and signal-boxes of later design just
completed and left there to operate for a
week continuously to give any defects an
opportunity to show themselves

   the original is now operated over -

	tunes and has not yet shown any
signs of wear this gives some idea of
the life of the mechanism if it had
been out on a track over which a hun-
dred trains passed daily it would have
taken twenty years to reach the same
point	v

  after a system is installed the signal
engineers of the railroads give a further
test by operating -it a week without the
semaphore-blades or with orders to the
engineers to ignore the signals if at the
end of that time it has not developed any
failing its future rests with the main-
tainor

  there are  miles of railroads
controlled by the automatic system as
against  operated by the manual
system with the aid of telegraph and
written orders no transcontinental sys-
tem is as yet fully equipped with the auto-
matic system  but under the harriman
regime the union pacific was changed
to the automatic over thirty-five per cent
of its length

the automatic stop

  danger from defective signaling is
practically removed by the automatic sys-
tem but it is still possible for the engi-
neer to run past signals this he could
not do if the automatic stop were in gen-
eral use  but it is installed in this country

now only on the subway systems of new
york and boston

  in the subway systems as soon as a
train runs upon a block occupied by an-
other train a trip lifts up from the side
of the track so placed as to strike the
end of an air-brake coupling which hangs
down at the side of the forward wheel
if the engineer does not see the signal
or is for any reason disabled the trip
strikes the loose coupling as the train
speeds past throwing it open and setting
every brake on the train

  there is no possible way to avoid that
trip there is stands inexorable as long
as there are wheels on the block as
soon as the train leaves the other end of
the block the trip drops and the track is
clear again

eliminating human element

  so far experiments in this country
with the automatic stop have not proved
successful as the trip becomes clogged in
bad weather better results have been
obtained however in england where the
automatic stop and cab signaling have
developed side by side

  two different forms of cab signaling
have been devised the audible and the
visible and in some cases both are used
for additional safety in the morris and
crabtree system as the train passes a
danger signal a track instrument com-
municates the fact through a current to
the wheel which sounds a bell in the cab
each time after passing a signal the en-
gineer must reach up and adjust the ma-
chinery

  the method invented by e a bowden
is if anything more unhandy a steam-
valve operating on the principle of a
safety-valve is placed in the cab the
steam is constantly trying to open it but
cannot on account of a lever which is
held in place by a wooden rod reaching
down close to the track

  when the engineer passes a danger-
signal a trip placed beside the track--
strikes the wooden rod breaking it and
allowing the steam to escape from the
valve after each whistle a new rod
must be fastened in by the engineer

  the most successful of the cab signals
has been installed by the great western
railway in england as a train passes-


the railroad mans magazine

into a block if the track is clear a bell
rings in the cab if there is danger ahead
a whistle blows the whistle taking the
place of the distant signal simulta-
neously with the ringing of the bell a
small semaphore-arm in the cab goes to
clear when the whistle blows it moves
to danger

  the signals are picked up from a ramp
on the track actuated by the same current
which moves the semaphore signals a
clear signal is given if the train connects
with one portion of the ramp and dan-
ger is shown if it strikes another

  in the engine there is a valve kept
closed by an electromagnet on a local
circuit normally closed the circuit
passes through the lower portion of the
locomotive where there is a switch held
in position by a lever which reaches down
low enough to strike the ramp as it passes
as it strikes it lifts breaking the cir-
cuit and if there is danger permitting
the whistle to blow and sending the min-
iature semaphore to horizontal

  if the ramp indicates that the track is
clear another current is sent through the
circuit ringing the bell and moving the
miniature semaphore to clear the whistle
being kept from blowing at the same time
by one of the electromagnets which holds
the valve down when the current is pass-
ing the ramp and the trip which is
connected with the automatic stop are
kept free from ice in winter by artificial
heating

worked without a hitch

  the problem of keeping the automatic
stop free from ice its greatest disadvan-
tage has been successfully solved by the
use of steam-heat this was found nec-
essary in the use of the ramp and the
two have been economically worked to-
gether during the great blizzard in the
spring of  when england was snow-
bound and the semaphore-poles were fro-
zen solid the ramp and the automatic
stop where they were in use worked
without a hitch the steam-heat kept
them free of snow and ice

  both cab signaling and the automatic
stop have proved so reliable on the great
western railway that the board of
trade the most conservative railroad
body in the world has given permission

to dismantle the semaphores over a dis-
tance of several miles

  coincident with the development of
signaling there has been steady progress
in the hardly less important matter of
switching

the magic interlocking

  the concentration of switch levers in
one cabin was found convenient as early
as  it was immediately obvious
that it was almost impossible not to make
a mistake now and then and throw the
wrong switch but eadlmistake meant a
wreck or an engine in the ditch

  there was no help for it however un-
til saxby and farmer invented the inter-
locking method which is in use in all its
essentials to-day by this device each
lever is connected to a slot occupied by
small blocks or  dogs  with pointed
noses capable of slipping into grooves
cut into a rod-the tappet bar-running
vertically hi the machine

  when a set of switches are to be
thrown the first movement of the lever
is to lift the rod which catches the noses
of all the  dogs  representing switches
involved in the movement by the me-
chanical arrangement of the  dogs one
that would cause an open switch or other-
wise break the track cannot be slipped
into a groove but will rest with its nose
against the grooveless portion of the tap-
pet bar

  if the leverman by mistake grasps the
wrong handle he finds it does not work
thus all danger is averted if any of the
switches necessary to form a certain clear
track are in use that fact also shows it-
self by the lever refusing to work

  while the making of a switch is in
progress all the other switches are im-
movable  but the moment it is made and
locked those not conflicting are released
and can be used for other purposes

  n the earlier machines those which
are worked by johnny armstrong
power the pulling of the lever turns a
pipe which parallels the track to the point
of the switch -two levers are necessary
-one to unlock the switch which is nor-
mally held rigid by a plunger and the
other to move the switch itself

  the english board of trade has lim-
ited the distance a switch can be located
signals that are perfect



from a manual plant to  feet but even
at that distance it takes beef to bring over
the levers

  motive power for switching purposes
was introduced in i the first was
hydraulic pressure a piston acting  a
combination of salt and water a leaky
machine which did not always do its duty
there were other faults to the interlock-
ing machines at that time

  there was no way of preventing a
switch from being thrown under a train
and making it do the splits this was
effectively stopped by the detector - bar
which was invented in 

   the detector-bar is a long strip of iron
paralleling the rail at a switch and con-
nected with the switching apparatus so
that it rises an inch above the rail during
the process of throwing the switch
while a train is passing it is impossible
to raise the detector-bar and throw the
switch

  it was not until  twenty years
after the discovery of interlocking that
it was introduced into america the
machinery was made in england and in-
stalled in this country by english me-
chanics who were brought over for the
purpose it was set up on the pennsyl-
vania railroad at east newark and its
advantages were so obvious that its use
spread rapidly especially at grade-cross-
ings and terminals

the electropneumatic

  hydraulic pressure as a motive-power
was superseded by the invention of the
low-pressure pneumatic machines in 
the first of which was placed in operation
at the north end of the  y  entering the
tracks to the centennial exposition

   four years later the high-pressure elec-
tropneuinatic machine took its place and
it is used successfully in many large ter-
minals to-day electricity is used to
operate the valves and compressed air
does the work which used to fall to the
leverman in the tower the machinery is
different but the method is the same the
air first unlocking the switch then throw-
ing and locking it again

  the introduction of the pneumatic ma-
chine greatly facilitated the handling of
traffic at terminals as it can operate over
any distance and there is nothing to wear

out the use of electricity to the exclu-
sion of the pneumatic system as invented
by taylor in  has created a rivalry
between the manufacturers of the two
kinds of plants and the result has been
increased efficiency on the part of both

  the electropneumatic is used in the
largest single switching tower in the
world in the yards of the glasgow cen-
tral depot where there are  levers
but the new tower in the grand central
station new york which will have 
levers will be operated by the all-electric

wonderful combinations

  in the interlocking plant there is a
close relation between switching and sig-
naling and it is not possible to complete
the switch until the signal-lever has been
pulled

  if a towerman had to remember each
time he threw a switch all the other
routes it conflicted with he could not
carry the knowledge in his head  but the
interlocking plant has a perfect memory
if one of the routes for instance passes
from one track to another through double
slips until it has crossed ten tracks the
interlocking plant will have a signal
showing on each of the tracks crossed as
soon as there is danger

  it has all been figured out in advance
and the necessary signal-wires have been
connected so that the moment a certain
route  is opened every signal on every
track affected flies to danger

  the detector-bar is no longer used in
modern plants a track circuit serving the
same purpose and occupying no room
as soon as a train enters a switch it
makes a connection in the relay which
locks the lever in the interlocking plant
making it impossible to throw the switch

the uses of the  make and break

  in the interlocking plant worked by
electricity as in the automatic signal it
is the making and breaking of circuits by
the lifting and falling of armature which
does the work instead of a lever there
is a handle which pulls out interlocking
the several levers which might conflict
and preventing complications

  during this part of the motion there is

	change in the electrical connection or


the railroad mans magazine

in the switch with the second part of
the pull on the handle the brushes which
have been connected with contact-slips 
one end of a controller pass to the con-
tact-slips on the other end breaking the
circuit and causing a new current which
throws the switch

  when the work is done if the switch
works right two parts of the machine
make a true connection and it is then
possible to give the handle a third pull
which releases the other switches and
locks the switch just made

  it takes a long time in the telling but
it happens in a fraction of a second if
the switch is pulled through the first
movement but will go no farther there is
something wrong with it and a repair-
man is hurried out to examine if the
switch is occupied it is altogether locked
and it is impossible to pull the handle
through even the first movement

  nothing has yet been invented to make
it possible to throw a whole set of
switches with one lever but lever-men are
so adept that they can throw half a dozen
switches with a motion that is practically
continuous the most that can be done
with one lever is to move both ends of a
double-slip switch with movable points

 the whole problem of a modern
switching plant must be solved in ad-
vance by the engineer who lays out the
plans on paper there is in it a very
complicated problem and the combina-
tions are gone over by half a dozen ex-
perts before work is commenced there
are sometimes hundreds of different routes
within a plant and there must be a com-
plete set of wires for each so that all con-
flicting switches will be locked and the
signals on all conflicting tracks show at
danger when any one route is open

  the engineers have reduced the tower-
mans duties steadily in this direction
they are now so carefully mapped out
that a greenhorn could go into a tower
and operate the plant he would be slow
but he could not make a mistake

  if he pulled the wrong lever lie would
find it locked if he tried to give a wrong
signal it would not work if he attempt-
ed to throw a switch under a train it
would be impossible

  at his back there would be a chart tell-
ing what levers to pull to open a certain
route in a frame in front of him he
would see an illuminated map of the
track showing the position of each of the
moving trains

  in themain tower in the grand cen-
tral station in new york a buzzer rings
whenever a train enters the terminal at
fifty-sixth street after that its move-
ments are shown  the illuminated map

  the short-circuiting of the automatic
signals by the train as it enters each block
is represented in miniature  the map by
the extinguishing of the tiny electric bulb
behind the glass as it passes to the next
block it in turn becomes dark and the
block out of which it has passed shows a
light again

  as it is impossible to see the trains
themselves more than half the time the
electric map is invaluable it keeps the
towerman accurately informed all the
time and saves him from attempting to
open a route before a train has altogether
cleared a conflicting switch as the trains
pass in and out of the station their shad-
ows appear to be crossing the map

  levermen in practise never refer to
the chart it becomes second nature for
them to throw the right switches for any
given combination but they constantly
watch the illuminated map as if they
were looking out of the window at the
actual trains

  when the terminal at the grand cen-
tral station is completed and the towers
are combined in one the movements of
all the trains within the terminal will
show on one large illuminated map the
tower itself will be remote from the track
and could well be half a mile away the
towermen will be guided solely by the
indications on the map

 is also called kuick-wa-tiao the carca-

 because the carcajou is a foul beast but
 it is a good name for him

    he was the husband of my sister
 and she is dead they were married five
 years ago at lac st jean at the little
 church of the oblate fathers you know
 in the reserve she was a fine strong
 girl and had taken many trips to the
 woods with my father we warned her
 against him for no one likes him  and
 sometimes he drinks hard

    but she had the madness of love and
 they went away together for the winters
 trapping they traveled back with their
 pelts and reached pointe bleue for the
 new year and she was very weary but
 made no complaint and soon they started
 again with big loads of provisions and
 she was carrying more than she ought

 when he was away looking after his traps

    she was all alone and saw no one for
 two days until he came back well she
 had carried the baby and a good load of
 pelts and had done her share with the
 paddle and the pole and was very weak
 we thought she had the disease of the
 chest you know the one that kills so
 many

    but she got better simon had no
 house at pointe bleue only a tent and
 she lived there during the summer while
 he went away he had sold his pelts
 well and was gone most of the time
 guiding gentlemen at the clubs but he
 often got drunk and sometimes was very
 bad when he returned

    that was their life for two years
 during which the baby died it had
 never been strong and the doctor at the
 reserve said that it was because my sis-
 ter was not well and the baby had
 never been well nourished it made her
 very unhappy they trapped in winter
 and simon worked somewhere near lac

 the time he was drinking too much

liquor to the indians on the reservation 
but when a man will drink and pays any-
thing they ask he can often get it for
there are always some who will run risks

   then my brother elias was grown
up and wanted to go trapping and my
father who had not gone for several
years thought he would like to try it
again and felt sure he could stand it
but we had little money and simon ad-
vanced enough for our provisions and
traps

   so we started off all together with
three canoes and big loads and i was
glad to be with my sister and she was
happy too we traveled more than a
month to get to grand lac manouan
and beyond it where simon had his camp
and his cache

   so we all campc-d near one another
and it was then we found out how bad
simon was to my sister for she had never
told he was quarrelsome and always
made her work harder than she ought
and he would tell us to go away if we
did not like it

   my sister then had another little
baby but she had to work like a strong
man skinning and cutting wood setting
snares for rabbits and doing the cooking
-and simon was grumbling and quar-
reling all the time the little one was

ill	and cried much like a white baby
and simon would swear at it

   the trapping was not very good
there were no beaver and the mink were
scarce and there were but few loup-
cerviers and otters my father and
brother worked hard all on one side of
a river while simon had his lines on the
other side they did better than he and
he was angry about that it was a life
of scolding

   then came the day when he had
brought a good otter-skin and it was
frozen and had to be thawed out a little
before scraping and stretching she was
working at it when the baby cried it
must have been in pain so she wept in
the tent and looked after it leaving the
skin on the ground  and a gust of wind
blew sparks and hot ashes over the pelt
and damaged it

   while she was looking at it he came
in she told him how it happened he
swore at her and the child and struck

her the baby was in her arms and the
blow made her fall in some way the
little one was hurt for in a day more it
was dead

   my sister was very strange after
that she never spoke at all and her
head was always bent very low when
we spoke to her she did not answer and
never cried  but looked as if some great
sickness had hold of her and we did not
see her eat

   then one day when simon had
been gone two days and she was resting-
in the tent my old father went to her
with some meat and found that she did
iiot move-for she was dead

   when simon returned next day and
was told he said she had ever been a
weak and sickly thing pie helped us
bury her and went back to his trapping

   yes sir he paid no more heed to
her than if she had been a dead dog but
he began to come always to our tent and
it was not more than a couple of weeks
before he made love to me

  pierre said something strong just then
and the gifl continued it seemed to do
her good to speak of all these things that
had made her heart sore and angry so
long she appreciated the sympathy ex-
pressed in the young mans looks

   yes sir to me her sister with her
poor body and that of the little one lying
frozen a foot or two under the earth near
by where they would not begin to thaw -
and pass away for many many months to
come

   i was angry and reproached him 
and my brother told him to leave me
alone and they quarreled- once i
threatened him with an ax and i think
i would have killed him if my poor old
father had not come between us but the
carcajou he went away laughing

  you know how it is when misfor-
tunes come they do not cease for a long
time elias my brother went away for
two days to attend to a line of traps and
didnot return we went in search of
him there had been no new snow since
he left and we followed him easily and
found him dead beside a dead bear

   the beast had been caught in the
trap and had carried it away far and
elias had followed him he was a big
bear and the drag- og had not hindered
him much but it was caught under
a heart of the north



some fallen logs when my brother
reached him and he had gone very near
to shoot the-bear was badly wounded
yet had made a leap that had broken the
drag-log away from where it was entan-
gled and he had caught elias

   yes sir it was a terrible time my
father became weaker on account of his
age and the misfortune he could do
little at the trapping and simon was
forever scolding because he had lent
money for the outfit and feared he would
not get it back

   he said he would forgive the debt if
i would marry him but i would not

   when spring came we all started
back leaving the little dead baby and the
brother and sister all together under
some big hemlocks when we reached a
place two days journey above the forks
in the manouan river my father was
taken ill but kuick-wa-tiao would not
wait and said we were to follow that
sickness lasted long  it was a pain and a
swelling of the legs and we remained
all summer

   how did you live  asked pierre

   i caught fish and rabbits but we had
no more tea last month when my
father was well we got down to the
forks and i said we would go a few
days journey up the shipshaw

   then i thought after a couple of
weeks that simon would have gone up
the manouan on his return journey and
that we would go down the river and not
meet him but he guessed what we had
done for he is here

  the girl stopped exhausted by her
long tale which she had told hurriedly
and excitedly pierre looked at her pity-
ingly in thorough understanding of the
little drama enacted in the wilderness

 you poor girl he said you
have been through purgatory havent
you just tell me what you want me to
do and ill help you to the best of my
ability

  justthen he saw the indian who came
along the portage staggering under a
huge load he was soon followed by
simon whose great bulk was bending un-
der the weight of several big poches

  after discharging their burdens they
came up to the tent and asked how the
old man was the half-breed peered in
and shook his head

  after lighting his pipe simon looked
at pierre for a moment scratching his
head uncertainly finally he spoke
he will not live - he is done for
you cannot do anything to save him

   im afraid not answered pierre

   well then there is no need of your
staying longer we can remain here and
take care of him as long as he lives and
afterward i will look after the girl

  pierre did not answer he was whit-
tling a stick with his knife and careful-
ly considered his work finally he said
slowly  well 

   well there is nothing to prevent you
from going on with your journey and you
can start as soon as you like

   all right answered the young man
with this non-committal remark he re-
sumed the shaving ofhis bit of spruce
sitting peacefully upon a log simon cast
evil looks at him and finally rose and
went down to the river where the indian
had lighted a little fire of chips and birch-
bark

  in a few moments the two were busy
boiling their spruce-gum and seal-oil in a
little pot and mending a crack in their
canoe at a place that had come in contact
with the sharp edge of a boulder simon
smeared the gum on the crack smoothing
it over with his wetted thumb and sus-
picious of another place applied his lips
to it and sucked hard but his cheeks re-
mained collapsed-no air was coming
through

   the  ousch  is tight now he said
the indian grunted assentingly care-
fully folding up a bit of cotton cloth
from which he had taken the small strip
that had been pasted over the crack with
the gum

   big fellow he said  the monsieur
 ill break his neck snarled simon
upon which the indian shrugged his
shoulders

  pierre went into the tent again for an-
other look at his patient anne marie
weary and ill had closed her eyes for a
moment and was asleep looking at the
old man lying there quietly he observed
a strange fixity in his gaze bending over
him and taking his hand within his own
the young man found that it was very
cold another glance revealed the truth
silently without stirring gently as in a
long deep slumber the end had come


the railroad mans magazine

  just then anne marie opened her eyes
something in pierres face told her the
truth but she made no outcry raising
herself to her knees with great tears
coursing down her cheeks her lips moved
without a sound

  she was taking this blow as she had
borne others-bravely and quietly with
the capacity for long - suffering of her
race with the courage of a strong nature
and with the real deep sorrow of a lov-
ing woman

  simon and his companion coming up
found the two kneeling down in the tent
they took off their caps and knelt also
praying silently mechanically impressed
for the moment but like children ready
to quickly forget

  in a few minutes they arose and began
to search under the trees for a spot fairly
free from rocks with sharpened poles
they pulled away the mossy carpet and
dug up the earth throwing out the heavy
black mold and the stones with their
hands until finally sweating with their
hard toil they decided that the grave was
deep enough and returned to the tent for
the body

   that is your coat said simon to
pierre

   yes answered pierre

    will take it off said the half-
breed

  no leave it alone ordered pierre

  simon shrugged his shoulders and the
three men took up their burden lifting it
carefully while the girl arose painfully
and slowly followed them

  pierre had carpeted the grave with fir-
boughs and anne marie noticed it the
old man was lowered into his last home
with the long tump-lines and simon was
about to begin pushing the earth back into
the cavity when pierre asked him to wait

  with his knife he ripped off some strips
of birch-bark from a tree near by and
covered the grizzled old face while the
girl looked at him gratefully the earth
was then pushed back and a rough cross
made of two sticks was planted at the
head

  pierre replaced the strips of moss with
the tiny leaves of wintergreen and wood-
sorrel peeping out of the velvety covering
until there was left but a rough spot that
would soon again be level with the soil of
the forest and a little perishable cross

to mark the coming and the passing of a
poor old savage

   maskoush get the book ordered si-
mon

  from the depths of one of the packs
maskoush-or little bear the indian-
brought out a prayer-book and handed it
to simon who quietly as if accomplish-
ing some strange rite in which the mum-
bling of unintelligible sentences was the
chief function read the latin words he
went on and on hardly stopping for
breath

  he scattered a handful of earth over
the grave in the form of a cross and
maskoush said  requicscat in pace aft-
er which the two men lighted their pipes
as if nothing unusual had happened

  pierre considered his three companions
simon the half-breed was evil with the
bad traits of two races while little bear
had been in some sort tamed by the white
men who had brought the sheet - iron
stoves the axes of steel the tea and the
wheat

  yet both were brutish-fit descend-
ants of a people that had made its wom-
ankind beasts of burden they carried
with them a prayer-book in a dead tongue
they did not understand it was a fetish
it would take generations for them to un-
derstand its spirit

  but the girl ou-memeou christened
anne marie seemed of a different sort
there was nothing in her of the broken-
spirited chewers of mens frozen mocca-
sins she had done vip her hair in two
long plaits that hung down her back and
her forehead showed intelligence her
eyes were beautiful calm at times yet
capable of showing passion her racial
characteristics were marked but the fine
oval of her face made her a thing of grace
and loveliness it was difficult to tell
how great an influence her religion might
have upon her mind yet pierre knew that
such as it was it must be with her a thing
of the heart-a sweetening and softening
power for good

  she was sitting on a near-by rock no
more tears were coursing down her face
her thoughts were not very complex yet
she realized that an important part in the
drama of her life was ended but the
struggle-the never-ending contest of
those who battle with the wild-was still
going on-and it seemed like a natural
a heart of the north



thing since her brief life had been spent
in a region that insists upon a constant
fight for existence and in which hunger
and cold are the paramount enemies

  the men who stood about her were
silent - thinking of a contest to come
hatred and jealousy were in simons
heart while contempt and the feeling of
enmity developed in men toward ill-
favored and dangerous beasts swayed
pierre

  the indian alone was indifferent he
had gone on this trip with simon be-
cause the latter was a successful trap-
per and because he knew he would re-
turn with a goodly minor share in the
spoils of the voyage but the love-af-
fairs of others were nothing to him but a
hindrance-a thing interfering with the
pursuit of pelts

  if needed he would take his partners
side of course he scented trouble and
disliked it the season was late and it
was high time they were on the trapping-
grounds

  he could not understand why simon
and pierre should want to quarrel
about the girl she was very poor she
had nothing he was looking forward
to marrying another girl for whom he
would have to give guns and blankets
but whose  well-off  father would soon
be leaving behind him a small house on
the reservation with a pony and a cow
two tents and a lot of traps

  a certain respect for the near presence
of the dead for the last words the girl had
uttered kept the men silent they could
still hear her anguished voice they felt
subdued by her presence for while she
was the cause of contention she was hurt
and sorrowing and even the gross nature
of the carcajou was for the time being
kept in bounds by her grief

  thus the men held in leash passions
that might at any moment break forth in
riot so still did they all keep that when
the indian finally tapped his pipe against
the trunk of a birch and began stolidly to
scrape the bowl with his knife all heads
turned toward him expectantly as if this
breaking of the silence portended some-
thing yet no one spoke lor many min-
utes until the half-breed finally began im-
patiently

    let us go back to the tent lie said
 it is time to eat

   	r r

  he went to the girl and took her gen-
tly by the arm she shook herself free
and walked alone slowly with much pain
and difficulty her nether lip pressed by
her white upper teeth the men followed
in silence the indian was evidently
quite unconcerned but the others were
both under tension and ready for trouble
when it should come

  they reached the tent and anne marie
sank down upon the fir-boughs with a
groan placing her hand upon her in-
jured side with a movement that had
become usual to her pierre was con-
cerned to see her looking so distressingly
ill

  the silence was again broken by si-
mon who was crouching by the fire hold-
ing a spiderful of slices of fat pork over
the flames

   you are a doctor  he asked pierre

   i know something of medicine an-
swered the latter

   how long before she will be able to
travel

   i do not know-perhaps many days
pierre replied guardedly he was look-
ing in the tent and saw that the girl
listened eagerly to their conversation

  there was a tense appearance in her
face-such as he had seen on the coun-
tenances of men approaching big game
or going out upon a log jam or making
ready to battle in the ring

  simons lips worked as he sought to
restrain the anger that was possessing
him

   many days maudit-he exclaimed
 never you take her for one of your
fine ladies perhaps she is anne marie
a savage like ourselves isnt she mas-
koush and he turned for confirmation
to the indian standing beside him  she
will be all right in a day or two she
can travel i will not make her carry
she need not touch a paddle do you
think i can waste my time here i must
go north and she goes with me 

  by this time the fat pork was burning
in the spider but the half-breed did not
notice it

   i suppose that is for her to say an-
swered the young man calmly

   it is what she is going to do snarled
simon  her father is dead now and
her brother loo and i am going to look
after her


the railroad mans magazine

   pierre noticed that the girl put one fin-
ger to her lips and nodded affirmatively
he understood at once that he was to in-
ter pose no objection

   oh well-it is nothing to me he
answered

  with that word the dark cloud of an-
ger that had been gathering was dis-
persed simons countenance assumed a
less unpleasant expression and he went
to work to fry more pork while maskoush
was making the tea

  they all had something to eat after
which simon went in search of a suitable
young spruce the blows of his ax rang
near by and he soon returned with a
straight trunk which he had already di-
vested of its branches

   this was split into a couple of rough
planks which were trimmed with the ax
after which he set to work to make a
paddle to replace one that was split in
the meantime the indian took off one of
his high moccasins and began to cobble it
with an awl and a piece of waxed thread
all was peace for the time being

  a short way above the camp a good-
sized brook fell in the river and pierre
wandering there noticed that fish were
rising in the pool above he returned to
the camp and put up one of his rods and
picked out some flies and was about to
start when the girl moaned he leaned
the rod against the tent and entered

    what is the matter he asked  is
the pain very bad 

    they must think it is very bad she
answered  i am not strong enough to
travel yet are they near  

    no they are down by the canoes

    well let them believe i am very ill
it is bad enough anyway but  must
think-oh i must think very hard

    i must think too said pierre

    do not stay here with me said anne
marie  the less you are here the better
pierre recognized the wisdom of this re-
quest there was no advantage in arous-
ing simons ready anger and jealousy any
more than could be helped

    all right ill go and catch some fish
if i can he replied if you think of
any plan let me know what it is and ill
do all i can for you

   he nodded to the girl in a friendly way
and took his rod his way led him near
the place where the two men were at work

they looked at him somewhat curiously
as he passed by them

   i think there are some trout in that
brook he said  im going to try

  the indian grunted something to the
effect that he believed there were some
little ones there but simon shrugged his
shoulders without meaning to pierre
had given the half-breed a favorable im-
pression he was a gentleman and only
cared for his sport he was going to
catch trout with that foolish little shiny
yellow rod he had done what he could
for the girl and her old father and now
only thought of fish

  he had not come into the woods all
alone like a stupid venturesome tender-
foot to get into a fight about a girl

  he probably thought it his duty to stay
another day or two until anne marie
should be better and then would go on
his way as soon as he understood that it
would be safer and healthier for him to
do so

  simon conscious of his own bulging
muscles and limited intellect overrated
his ability to deal with the situation he
hardly considered the girl as of any im-
portance in the crossing of his will
women were the prey of men like the
beavers and the loup-cerviers and be-
longed to the strongest who by right of
their thews and sinews were entitled to
the kisses of the first and the pelts of the
others

  accustomed as he was to lifting huge
loads he did not realize the springs of
steel that were hidden in the long lithe
arms of pierre who after all handled an
ax in a way to make a real woodsman
laugh

  the young man had reached the pool
and began casting a brown hackle and a
montreal over its riffled water at the
second or third attempt he got a rise and
soon landed a small trout in a few min-
utes more he got a second and a third one

  a few more casts were fruitless and
he pulled out some more line to reach an
eddy just back of a large rock that rose
out of the water at the head of the pool
as the hackle descended gently upon the
surface there was a boiling of the water
a glimpse of a broad back a reddish and
silvery flash and then the music of the
reel

  this was no quarter-pounder such as
a heart of the north



he had just landed in a moment the joy
of a big fight was on him everything
else in the world was forgotten there
was the rapid cutting of the water by the
tense line and the tugs that make the
heart beat lest the tackle should prove
weak or the fish be poorly hooked

  down in the deepest part of the pool
and up again along the sides where he
sought to entangle the line upon broken
sunken branches across and back the
game old trout carried on the contest
then pierre realized that he had no land-
ing net there was no sandy place where
he might lead the fish into shallow water
he must have the net or lose the big fel-
low and shouted lustily

  simon came running down and pierre
asked him to go up to his tent and bring
the landing net simon hastened off and
soon returned with it taking a seat upon
the bank and watching the contest

  the big trout was done for several
times it half turned upon its side and
pierre then managed to reel him in close
to the bank where with a triumphant
whoop the half-breed scooped him up in
the net neatly and cleverly

    it is a fine trout  he said grinning

  pierre much pleased with the world in
general answered pleasantly and the two
returned to the tent as if they had been
friends all their lives

   the little spring-scale said four pounds
and a half and simon turned the fish
over to maskoush who went down by the
river to clean it

  pierre entered the tent he had held
up the fish in order to show it to the girl
and she smiled

   that is right-be friends she said
 he must not suspect

  pierres spirits fell he had really
quite forgotten for the time being that
there was any trouble in the camp

   have you thought of anything  he
whispered anne marie shook her head

   not vet she replied  it is very
hard

chapter iv

shooting many rapids

cor the next two days they passed
the time as best they could the
girl remaining in the tent pierre fish-

ing smoking cleaning his gun and talk-
ing to the indian or to simon who over-
hauled mended patched cooked and
played cards with a greasy pack as if
time had been of not the slightest conse-
quence

  on the third day it rained fitfully
and fallen leaves began to fly over the
river there was nothing to do and their
inaction made the men restless they
were all gathered in the large tent where
anne marie was lying down apparently
as ill as ever

  isnt she ever going to get well
simon asked the young man discontent-
edly as if resenting the fact that he was
unable to cure her more quickly

   there are broken ribs answered the
latter  you know as well as i do that
broken bones do not mend quickly

   and are you going to stay here until
they are mended

 well answered pierre  i ought to
think about making a start pretty soon
 we are losing time growled simon
 the cold weather will soon come we
have a long way to go

  there was an interval of silence and
then the half-breed spoke again in a
temper as if his restrained anger was
finding a sudden outlet

   i shall make a start to-morrow

   anne marie cannot travel yet re-
plied pierre

  she can travel if it had not been
for your putting such foolish ideas into
her head she would already have started

i have told you she would do no work
maskoush and i will do all the carrying
all the cutting wood all the cooking all
the paddling i have fourteen hundred
pounds of provisions we have to go
three times over every portage four times
over the hard ones-

   simon interrupted the girl  i
shall not start to-morrow i am not well
enough the day after i will start if
you will promise to take me to antoine
garauds camp  the riviere a la lou-
ire

  antoine garauds wife was related to
the girl and their camp was not over
forty miles from simons place near
grand lac manouan this plan did not
suit simon very well but promises were
easy to make

   you can begin to make your packs


the railroad mans magazine

monsieur said the girl turning to
pierre  you have been very kind i
suppose you will leave to-morrow

   yes of course he replied unhes-
itatingly yet not knowing in the least
how the tide was running  til pack up
to-morrow after breakfast

  simon looked much pleased and after
a few minutes went out with the indian
not heeding the rain and walked down
to where his canoe was turned over on
the sand at the landing-place

   i dont quite understand what youre
driving at said pierre as soon as the
other two were out of hearing

  the girl looked at him for a few min-
utes before answering

   i can take a gun and kill him but
we sauvages of the pointe bleue are
christians now if you and i should
run away they would pursue us we
can only go down the river and with
you alone to paddle they would catch us
at the first portage you would have
to carry all your stuff and they would
only take enough for two or three days
then there would be a fight

   if you were killed or hurt i should
have to go with them you were very
strong and brave when you pulled me
out of the water but you ought to have
let me go over the falls if we tried
to go in the night they would surely
hear us if they did not they would
be after us at daylight

  if he keeps his promise to take me
to antoine all will be well but if he
does not i have a good knife perhaps
god might forgive my own blood hav-
ing seen how much i have suffered

   i wish i could help you exclaimed
the young man  surely there must be
a way

  he was getting more and more excited
and continued

   hes a big chap  but one man with
a gun is as good as another and my gun
is a lot better than his

   there is no bad gun at close range
said the girl quietly

  no of course not but it seems to
me that if you had told him you wouldnt
go and if i had told him to go to the
deuce he might have made up his mind
to keep quiet as to a fight i dont think
im afraid of him big as he is

   you are not afraid  asked the girl

with a strange light in her eyes  pie
is so big and strong 

   i dont think i am anne marie
he answered simply

  she rose to her feet quickly not mind-
ing the pain that stabbed her chest

   go down to the landing quietly and
smoke your pipe and talk to them i
will come soon perhaps there will be a
fight

  he went down to the strand where
simon and maskoush were investigating
a leaky flour - bag and carefully sewing
it up having made a shelter by tilting up
one side of the overturned canoe and
sticking a paddle under it so that the
precious flour should not get wet

  he leaned against a tree cutting to-
bacco and began idly to ask questions
about the value of mink and marten
pelts an absorbing topic which immedi-
ately brought about much discussion

  in the meanwhile anne marie had
quickly raised the wall at the back of her
tent and not without hurting her side a
good deal managed to get at one of the
pegs and pull it out

  then she crawled out and quickly
made her way to simons tent having
seen that its entrance was concealed by
trees and rocks from the place where he
now was on the shore

  there were two guns in the tent a
double - barreled muzzle - loader and an
old single - barreled hudson- bay com-
pany -gage

  she took out the ramrod of the double
gun-one end had a double screw for
pulling out wadding-and in a few min-
utes she had drawn out the charges from
both guns she left the caps in position

  in case of a fight a good deal was
gained she returned stealthily to her
tent after replacing the ramrod and
carefully putting the guns back where
she had found them she then knelt
down and prayed kissing a little brass
medal that hung from her neck

  when she rose she hesitated for a
moment putting her hand this time not
upon the wounded side but upon the
place where her heart was throbbing
then she slowly made her way to where
the three men were talking and working

   ah you can walk now  exclaimed
simon  that is right in a few days
you will be as well as ever
a heart of the north



    yes answered anne marie quiet-
 ly  i can walk but it still hurts much
 never mind replied the half-breed
 cheerfully by to-morrow you will be
 better still and we will make an early
 start

    an early start yes she assented
  buj before i go there is something to
 be done over at the grave i want you
 to come there and you maskoush and
 you monsieur if you will be so kind
 pierre came toward her with well-
 simulated indifference but wondering
 what her plan was simon rose from
 his seat under the canoe quickly and was
 followed in a more leisurely manner by
 the indian

    what is the matter  asked the half-
 breed curiously and casting suspicious
 looks upon the girl

    come with me was all she an-
 swered as she started toward the little
 moss - covered mound only a few yards
 distant from the tents

    she wants us all to pray said si-
 mon to the indian it is but right
 when they reached the grave the girl
 stopped and leaned against the trunk of
 the big birch that had begun to scatter
 its leaves upon the remains of her old
 father there was an expression of pain
 and sadness on her face and with the
 back of her hand she wiped a tear from
 her bronzed cheek

    i am to say good-by to the last of
 my own people she began i have no
 one left but the wife of my fathers older
 brother the one who was caught in his
 nets on lac st jean the day of the great
 storm two years ago there is antoines
 wife also only a cousin of my mother
 now i am willing to go with you si-
 mon because you promise to take me to
 antoine he will be glad of my help
  around his camp you have promised
  yes of course certainly i have
 promised he answered scratching his
 head and avoiding the keen glance the
 girl was directing toward him

    you have promised continued the
 girl  but promises are forgotten i
 am afraid of you simon you have
 broken promises to others but  will go

    you say that you are the proper per-
 son to take care of me now that my fa-
 ther is dead my sisters husband should
 certainly have been the one to protect

 me i will go simon but i think the
 poor old dead man there at our feet
 would not have liked to see me go with
 you but i am willing for there is
 nothing else to do

   now you maskoush and you mon-
sieur have heard the promise but it is
not enough to keep the dead mans spirit
at rest you will put your hand simon
here over the grave and upon the dead
man you will swear to do me no harm
and to take me to antoine garaud on
the rioiere a la loutre and to leave me
there

   there was an impressive silence after
the girl had spoken a dark-red flush
broke out upon the half-breeds cheeks
his left fist was clenching and opening
his right was edging around to his back
where the sheath-knife hung from the
folded sash around his waist

  in another moment he had broken out
in a rage

   what is that  he shouted  i am
a liar am i  a man whose promises
are no good  i am to swear eh  what
are you trying to do

   i suppose you brought the monsieur
to hear this to make him laugh at me
i have promised that is enough i will
take you and if you refuse to come i
ill make you

   i will tie you and put you in the
canoe like a poche and the monsieur if
he does not like it i will slap his face
maudit yes i will and send him crying
to his mother who do you take me for
to laugh at me  at me -yes -me  si-
mon carcajou 

  the mans voice shook with rage yet
a vestige of respect for the dead man
buried at his feet kept him slightly un-
der control he was a handsome big
brute in his fury and angered as pierre
felt at the insult he kept quiet observ-
ing him with a certain strange interest
such as he had experienced in the pres-
ence of maddened animals

   a raging bull a moose stag or a bear
crazed by the torture of a steel trap is
no more faithful picture of fierce anger
than was that shown by the distorted
features of the half-breed

    so you dare not swear   asked the
girl slowly

    i dare everything now  he retorted
furiously  i shall take you with me


the railroad mans magazine

wc are far from where men live no one
shall stop me and as for you mon-
sieur  give you half an hour to pack
up your things and go 

   this thing has gone on far enough
replied pierre  you have heard what
the girl said she will have her own will
if you refuse to swear she goes with
me

   with you maudit  he shrieked
 you have been telling her fine tales i
swear you want her for yourself do
you she is no woman for a monsieur
she is one of us and stays with us and
ill not allow you to make a plaything
of her and to taunt me here in the for-
est where i am a man and you a fool
you are a fine monsieur you think and
have only to look at our women to se-
duce them

   youre a scoundrel  shouted pierre

  like a flash simons hand went back
to his hip for his sheath-knife but with
lightning speed the young man advanced
and his long sinewy arm shot out

  the fist crashed mightily against the
half-breeds jaw the man took a step
backward dazed for he knew nothing
of this sort of fighting and his hands
slowly dropped

  another thunderbolt seemed to strike
him as pierre swung fiercely under his
left ear and the big fellows knees gave
way beneath his weight

  limp collapsed he sank down an in-
ert mass felled like a bullock the blood
all gone from his face a pitiful hulk of
broken humanity and again pierre his
anger all gone looked down upon him
curiously as one looks upon the charging
moose that has been stopped by a bullet

  it had all happened so quickly that
the other two had not moved but sud-
denly anne maries hand shot out behind
the indian and when she pulled it back
she had his knife

   take care maskoush she cried
and the man knew that though she was
wounded she was a wounded panther
lithe quick strong-a fierce thing in a
fight

   it is nothing to me he said  it
is not my quarrel i want to take no
woman to the winter camp the vwn-
sieur he is a magician an anamakqm his
fit is like the horn of moosiua the
moose

   simon thought to find impoose the
rabbit and he has met maheigan the
wolf now do him no further harm and
i will not move he will be well soon
you can give me the knife it is not for
you or for the man with the strong
arm i will harm neither of you you
have my word

  not yet you shall have it when the
time comes we need help now you
monsieur watch simon do not let him
get up come with me maskoush
the girl went to the tent with the in-
dian and came out with pierres rifle and
an old tump-line that had belonged to
her father they returned to the grave
near which simon had been lying he
was now sitting up still dazed and glar-
ing stupidly at pierre

   tie him she said to the young
man  his arms and his feet so that
he may not move take this tump-line
it is long enough simon if you move
i have the monsieurs gun it shoots
many times quick and will be for you
also maskoush if you do not take care
the indian shrugged his shoulders in-
differently and simon made an effort to
get up but desisted as the rifle went up
to the girls shoulder

  pierre brought the half-breeds elbows
as far back as he could and lashed them
securely the long end of the tump-
line was then carried down to the feet
which were well bound by several twists
and some half-hitches

   we will leave you here and take
maskoush with us to help over the port-
age said anne marie  then we will
send him back if you follow us down
the river you will find us watching and
the rifle carries far

   i could kill you now for the things
you have done but i will not but if
you come after us i will say you seek to
injure us and it is war and the mon-
sieur shoots to kill you have heard
the half-breed cursed her but she
paid no attention and spoke again 

   maskoush has to help us because i
will not leave him with you until we are
on our way i will not smash your guns
because you will need them north in the
winters trapping i will fix your canoe
so that you may not use it to-day mon-
sieur take the gun and watch them
both
a heart of the north	

  she handed the gun to the young man
and went down to where the two canoes
had been placed in a short time she
had rgjnoved several of the cedar ribs
from the larger one and then she stabbed
the birch - bark deeply in a number of
places

  it would take some time to repair all
this damage while it would leave the
boat as good as ever when mended the
loosened ribs which she -threw in the
fire would take some time to replace

  she came back panting bending
down over the canoe had given her pain
but she paid little heed to it

   now give me the gun monsieur and
please pack up everything my big bent
you cannot take nor the big traps pack
up all the moose meat and your packs
and all that is yours

  pierre went to work with a will while
the girl rested sitting on a log with the
gun in her hands watching the indian
and the half-breed the latter had a full
use of his tongue by this time and cursed
his companion

   thou will let them go mandit ill
break thy neck when i get loose im
like a fish in a net now but if i were
free like thee i would leap upon the
she-devil and have my knife in her
heart gun or no gun but she shall
pay for it aye even if i only catch her
after she has got back to pointe bleue
and made them all laugh at how i was
tied up like a swine for killing oh
thou shalt pay dear for this

   ill take no chances answered the
indian sulkily  she has the gun and
my knife and the monsieur has picked
up thine i am thy companion for a
winters trapping and for naught else
after they are gone i am with thee and
will do whatever pleases thee

   nearly all the traps are thine and
thou hast paid for most of the food
but now i will do whatever they tell
me for they are the strongest the youth
has the strength of a bear though he is
built like a deer

  these words caused the girl to turn
her head a little and she locked curi-
ously upon the young man as if she had
seen him for the first time his shoul-
ders -were broad enough and he was more
than middling tall there was a certain
grace about his movements and the long

limbs moved beneath the narrow lvips
with a litheness which the men of her
ken never howed accustomed as they
were from boyhood to the packing of
crushing weights

  it took but a short time to make up
all the bundles and pierre soon called
out that he was ready

   i can take but a small load said
the girl

    take the rifle that will be more than
enough replied pierre

  anne marie turned to simon

   we will see thee again soon she
said

  he did not answer and pierre took up
the canoe

   maskoush ordered the girl  take
a load and walk before me

  the indian obeyed without a word
and the three soon disappeared along the
path over the portage

  as soon as they reached the end they
returned for another load but before de-
parting for the last trip the girl spoke
to the half-breed -

   simon i could have destroyed the
canoe and smashed the guns but per-
haps i may find i was wise to leave thee
the means to go quietly up north i shall
watch for thee keenly and if thou triest
to pursue us we will defend our lives
adieu

  so once more they returned along the
carry paddy abandoned the long watch
he had undertaken by simon and ceased
the growling he had kept up every time
simon made the slightest motion he
ecstatically sallied forth along the port-
age in one of his vain hunts for rabbits
and squirrels while the three sturdily
marched in silence

  upon reaching the end pierre put the
canoe in the water and began to load it
while the girl continued to watch the in-
dian

  as soon as everything was ready
pierre held the boat while the girl
stepped in

   the knives said maskoush

   i will throw them answered the
girl

  pierre pushed off and when they were
a few yards away anne marie flung the
knives to the indian who picked them up
and rather to pierres surprise called
out bon voyage 


the railroad mans magazine

   wait  called the young man
searching through his pockets hastily he
found his pipe-a fine brier-nd threw it
to maskoush

    you should have something for car-
rying he said

  the indian caught it deftly and
smiled bon voyage he sang out
again

  have we everything anne marie
asked pierre

   everything she answered and
great tears came in her eyes

  pierre was surprised but decided that
she was thinking of the brother sister
and father whose bodies were scattered
under the black soil of the great forest
along the way from grand lac mano-
uan

  they had expected to see the indian
running back swiftly to free his com-
panion but he stood looking at them
until they disappeared in a bend of the
river and then returned leisurely along
the path

    hes a rather decent chap isnt he 
remarked the young man

   maskoush is a good man last year
he was fined for hunting in the park and
he had to sell everything to pay the fine
simon wanted a companion and has ad-
vanced some of the money but if si-
mon has any whisky he will make him
do anything i fear

  the girl had quickly dried her tears
the way down-stream was easy with a
fair current and the canoe traveled
swiftly anne marie had taken a pad-
dle and was working away quietly but
suddenly she turned around looking very
pale

   i cannot it hurts too much

   put down that paddle he answered
quickly  i should not have allowed
you to try it turn around and keep
a sharp lookout behind us

   there is no danger to-day she re-
plied

  but while he steadied the canoe for
a moment she turned around facing
him and sat down apparently exhaust-
ed one of her hands resting upon the
dog sitting contentedly by her

  will they try to catch us asked
pierre

   i dont know she replied  it may
depend on the drink i should have

hunted through their packs and broken
the bottles but then that would have
made them furious he knows we must
travel very slowly but perhaps bethinks

	was not really hurt much and can
help

   i fear he will try he is revengeful
and no one ever beat him before he
has always beaten all men at the wres-
tling that was a terrible blow you gave
him i did not think that a blow from
a fist could make a great strong man
tumble down like an ox

  pierre put his paddle over his knees
for a moment to light his spare pipe
and looked at the raw knuckles of his
right hand

   it was a good punch he admitted
 but the question is what are we going
to do it is going to be a job traveling
with the idea that at every bend in the
river he may overtake us and begin shoot-
ing what sort of a gun has he by the
way 

   a shotgun she replied  shoots
big round balls for big game

   and maskoush 

   a single - barrel - old hudson bav
-little ball

   neither of them much good beyond
a hundred yards he commented feel-
ing somewhat relieved yet remembering
that once in a while one hears of wonder-
ful shots made with a big round ball in
a smooth bore

  it was yet early in the afternoon and
a gentle breeze was rippling the water
and stirring the leaves of the white-
trunked poplars

  pierre paddled on steadily and strong-
ly and seemed to be traveling fast yet
he knew that his speed was as nothing
compared to what the other two could
accomplish if they cached all their stuff
and came after them as fast as they could
after repairing their canoe

  there was something strange about
this trip the unconventional compan-
ionship disturbed the young mans mind
to some extent the idea had not sug-
gested itself to him before

  yet when he looked at the dusky crea-
ture before him clad in the rags that
were left her after a hard year in the
north and considered that she was but
a poor suffering wild thing upon which
he had taken pity he smiled to think
a heart of the north	

that some mrs grundy back in the civ-
ilization from which he was so distant
might have something to say

  there was also a queer sensation of
helplessness and he realized that in this
expedition she was the leader in her
keen strong young face he read wonder-
ful determination and after all her life
had been of the woods her mind under-
stood the workings of indian brains her
experience was such that under these cir-
cumstances he was a willing but inex-
perienced woodsman and hers was the
craft needed for a voyage that might be
easy or might prove full of difficulties
so he again spoke to her

   anne marie we must decide upon
what we are going to do those two
can catch us if they try i dont know
what is best i am not of the woods
you must decide and i will do whatever
you say you must think and tell me
your plan i leave it all to you

  she looked at him somewhat sur-
prised an instinctive modesty a feel-
ing that her judgment was nothing as
compared to that of an educated mon-
sieur prompted her answer

  you are a monsieur very strong
and i only a girl and weak it is not
for me to say

   but you know a lot more about this
sort of thing than i do he retorted
somewhat impatiently  after all this
is all your affair you know and im giv-
ing up my trip to help you out just
forget all about my being a monsieur
and get it into your head that i expect
you to boss the whole thing now tell
me all about it like a good girl

  he lifted his paddle from the water
and raised the blade high up putting
his lips to the handle and allowing the
water to run down into his mouth the
girl thought for a moment before speak-
ing

   we can only make the next portage
before dark she said  simon cannot
follow very close it would take a good
many hours to mend the canoe and then
he knows we are watching for him it
is pretty late in the year for his long
journey perhaps he will not follow

   but the man loved you he object-
ed  and then he may want revenge
he may have that whisky you know

  	oh he is mad monsieur fie is

furious by this time he wants me and
he wants revenge i should have killed

him

   well that may happen to him yet
said pierre  but i think it would have
been rather high-handed so you think
he is pretty sure to follow us

    he will follow i fear

  all right thats settled now tell
us what to do he answered lightly as
a youth whose sore knuckles spoke of an
easy victory already achieved and who
in consequence was not disposed to at-
tach very great importance to his foe

   we must get beyond the portage and
travel as far as we can even after dark
and then we must hide ourselves some-
where and watch the river they will
not travel at night as they will be afraid
to pass us

   we must go on only in broad day-
light after that and keep on watching
the river then if we should see them
we must go ashore at once and if they
come on you must fire if they are in
deep water hit the canoe low down that
will stop them but if they are in shal-
low water you must shoot at simon

  it did not seem like much of a plan
but pierre could think of nothing better
and decided that after all circumstances
would have to guide them he bent to
his task again and for a monsieur cer-
tainly sent the canoe at a lively gait yet
from further experiences he dimly sus-
pected that even anne marie had she
been in her usual health could have pad-
died it faster and more untiringly than
himself he remembered how he had
seen mere children of the north making
canoes fly

   the girl with the rifle near her right
hand and still resting the left on pad-
dys back kept watch over the river

  her gaze hawklike remained stead-
ily upon the river behind them and even
when pierre addressed her she never
for a moment relaxed her watchfulness

  he began to question her about her-
self and she replied in few words yes
she knew how to read and write-the
oblate fathers had taught her she
could also speak a little english but it
was a very difficult tongue to her

   she had taken her first communion six
years ago-she was eighteen now her
father and all her people were mon-


the railroad mans magazine

tagnais except her fathers sisters hus-
band who was a tete de boule mas-
koush was an algonquin his father and
mother had come from somewhere down
the saint laurent

  now the river was narrowing passing
between cliffs topped with a disheveled
mass of rank and tangled vegetation
the deepening water became very dark
and silently swift a fish-eagle hovered
overhead with great wings nearly mo-
tionless at intervals he uttered a rasp-
ing cry and then the deep silence reigned
again but was soon dispelled by the
booming of tumbling waters

   look out for the rapids cried anne
marie  the saut is to the right

   i had to portage here and right
there near the little sand-spit is where
i camped for the night said pierre

   yes but you can shoot the rapids
easily it is all strong smooth water
on that side stay very near the shore

  the river was narrowing still more
and they swiftly reached a place where
the white water was beginning to boil
a powerful stroke of the paddle sent the
canoe well inshore

  the current seized it and bore it fast
toward an upstanding boulder but an-
other stroke guided it just to one side
and the great rock shot by them like a
living flying thing while they went on
down-down-with the speed that in-
toxicates

  in another moment the frail craft was
bobbing gently up and down in the eddy
at the foot of the rapids they rested
a moment while pierre lit his pipe again
and started once more the paddle ever
dipping dipping until the motion be-
came a monotonous grind and there was
no sound but the drip drip of the paddle
and no motion but the rhythmical short
straight-elbowed sweep of the arms

  once in a while the paddle was
changed to the other side and all along
pierre was conscious of the unending
stare just to one side of his head of the
indian girls dark eyes paddy was ly-
ing still unconcerned only wagging his
tail whenever his master looked at him
or spoke

  the young man was in good training
yet his arms ached with the toil and his
speed had diminished a little-

to be c

  the sun was touching the jagged edge
of the distant woods in the west when
anne marie spoke

   the portage is ten minutes she
said without even turning her head  it
is a short one and the landing is on the
right

  in a few moments the roar of the
cataract could be heard the water
rushed down on both sides of a little
island

   they landed upon a huge flat rock and
anne marie with the gun sat down
still watching the river while pierre
came and went with his loads

  once more they embarked and the
journey was resumed until in half an
hour the girl pointed to a high rocky
island that stood like a sentinel in the
river

   they got out on a bit of shelving rock
and pierre carried the canoe out of sight
from the river the packs followed and
by the time this was done the darkness
was upon them and they stumbled about
in search of a spot level enough to put
up the tent

  they found no place where the white
silk would be out of sight from the river
and decided not to use it fir was plen-
tiful and they soon had a lot of bedding

    what if they go by us in the dark 
asked pierre as he opened one of the
packs for food

    i have said they will not travel in
the dark if they went by us they might
have to go far and waste time they
would make tracks over the portages and
we would know that they are ahead no
they will not go by in the dark

    shall we make a fire 

    yes a small hot fire-there between
the two big rocks

  pierre -got some of his half-smoked
moose meat and started the kettle for the
tea he first fried some of the meat
and then made a couple of big flap-
jacks the whole size of the frying-pan
as soon as this was done he threw water
upon the fire and they began their meal

   pierre was ravenous but the girl ate
little paddy as usual was ready for
all he could get

   as soon as they had finished they took
their blankets and wrapped themselves
up lying down under the fir-trees

ntinued 
ohalloran of section 

by j r stafford

            roberman hired him to be a fool
            but even fools have their privileges

fust as robermans section-gang
was knocking off for the day
ohalloran six feet tall and
every inch of him in a hurry
dashed up along the track like
a man in search of a doctor
opposite the hand-car however he halt-
ed and began abruptly

   me frinds i am but thray wakes in
ameriky aan i kem from thot parrat av
the ould sod which prodhuced willington

nayparthe at waterloo they were both

higher form av learning

phwat i kem rushin fure
to ask wor a job me
frinds

  now robermans sec-
tion-gang consisted of
five worthless ignoram-
uses-and roberman of
what roberman consist-
ed i leave you to judge

his father who was
the president of some
sailroad or another had

tried to start him first in one department
then in another and at last had given
him up

  wherefore roberman whose head was
the shape of a door-knob and only a little
larger had determined to make a great
effort for himself at that time the g
and t belonged to nobody being domi-
nated simultaneously by seventeen sets of
stock and bond holders

  each set dreamed of finding a power-
ful railroad ally somewhere which would
force the other sixteen out of business

  roberman scion of roberman the pres-
ident was the very man for whom the




the railroad mans magazine

g and t was looking he permitted
himself to be found but there his com-
plaisance had ended because when it was
insisted that he accept the post of general
manager he replied that he desired to be

o halloran was doing
all the work

o  

like his father a practical railroad man

  if they would not start him in at the
bottom then he would not start if he
had reached for it then he might have
had the presidency but he had after all
only the ambition of a cart-horse-so he
asked for section 

  he had now been foreman a little over
two weeks but in that two weeks in the
processes of natural selection  he had
gathered around him the most ignorant
white men who ever mauled spikes he
would have been happy but for one thing
there was no one to amuse him

  but now as he stood listening to
ohalloran he was overjoyed the
irishman would help to pass the tune
away he hired him on the spot 

   be me sowl misther roberman but
its the foine thing yiz
have done fure me this
day ohalloran pro-
claimed as he boarded
the hand-car and be-
gan pumping with a
jerk that swept the
three men on the other
bar clear off their feet
 aan savin thot too a
foine thing yiz ha done
fure yersilf fure be
the luk av yiz about the
forrid aan the oies-
meanin no disrespect-
but yiz will be nadin a
powerful frind yerself-
wan av these foine
days aan whin yiz do
beloike it will be tim-
othy ohalloran thot
will rise up aan stand
betune yiz aan the
boss thots higher up
roberman having
taken on ohalloran as
kings take on jesters
forgot that the fool has
his prerogatives it oc-
curred to him that it
would be well to knock
the irishman off the
hand-car and rim over
him but being one of
those who decide on one
thing and then do an-
other he grinned sheep-
ishly and deferred ac-
tion until he could take an hour off and
think it over

  when they came to the section-house
he ordered ohalloran to stow the tools
and commanding the crew to follow he
repaired to the bunk-house and laid the
case before his advisers

   wots the harm in im raddles
who was a genuine hobo demanded
 he might work an if he would hes
big enough to do everthing thats alius
been my idee of a good time to have a
feller along that would do the heavy lift-
in an the sweatin jist as lies a doiti
olialloran of section 



now he turned and pointed to where
ohalloran ignorant of the use of the
rails leading to the shed was simply drag-
ging the hand-car over the ties by main
strength

   thats the system another of the
crew agreed look at him thats the
way to pay him off roby work him to
death an let yer friends take it easy
roberman decided there was wisdom
in the advice not being gifted with the
large patience necessary to follow out the
plan he proceeded to the tool-house for
the pleasure of a little momentary ven-
geance

  being awkward in attack he began
 well i see you have hauled that car in
say you havent any more brains than to
do what youre told you havent any
more sense than a work-horse you clumsy
bog-trotter  and he was very angry as
he said it

   childther ohalloran observed
good-humoredly  are niver quite fit fure
the jobs av men but its no parrt av
moine to be kickin fure i have said i
shall be a powerful frind to yiz on ac-
count av yiz havin givin me me start in
this loife whin yiz become a hobo aan
i be siction-boss yiz will undherstand
roberman forced derision from his
wrath and succeeded in cackling impu-
dently 

   your start in this life 

  he imagined this lead would afford an
opportunity for wittily overthrowing
ohalloran your start in this life
humph you must expect- to amount to
something eh what do you think youll
amount to flow do you imagine you
will ever get on top 

   be doin me work ohalloran an-
swered simply  jist as me fayther who
wor a schoolmaster av the hedges used
always to say to me aan his last word
befure i tuk ship a month ago wor  me
by in ameriky all yiz have to do will be
all thots set fure yiz aan some day the
main boss over thim all will come around
aan see it aan he will take yiz by the

  still roberman had not enough he
persisted   you couldnt fill a high place
if you had it you ignorant chump

  after that roberman contented him-
self with the satisfaction of giving the
irishman three mens work and seeing
that he did it and there was no trouble
in finding work on section  it was the
worst on the division the whole eight
miles traversed a badly broken country
since the g and t had been built by a set
of promoters who merely wanted a profit
on the construction the construction was
of a wonderfully fearful character

  the ties lay unballasted and there were
curves where there should have been
straight stretches the management be-
ing perfunctory had attracted to it in the
natural process of organization the most
worthless and incompetent heads of de-
partments you could imagine

  the roadmaster whose business it was
to see that roberman kept section  in
order merely came around once a month
and after smoking a short pipeful got
on his velocipede pumped on to the next
section and eventually to undisturbed
slumbers in his office at headquarters


the railroad mans magazine

  but section  began to enjoy a differ-
ent reputation no sooner did ohal-
loran realize that he was doing all the
work than he grew vastly interested in
doing the work well it made no differ-
ence to him that roberman and raddles
and the rest sat in the shade of the near-
est tree and played seven-up while he set
spikes and drove them home

  he had seen railroads where trackage
is a first consideration and having ob-
served he knew what constituted a road-
bed ballasting by hand-work is a slow
process but ohalloran studying each
superfluous curve and tossing cobbles
while he studied soon had a bit of found-
ation in those places where a foundation
was most needed

  immediately after he had made these
simple improvements the roadmaster
came along never had that official
dreamed of so much permanent work on
the g and t remembering that ro-
berman was the son of a great railroader
the roadmaster sent in such a fulsome re-
port on the magnificent showing of sec-
tion  that roberman was summoned to
headquarters and tendered the position
of roadmaster

  when it was explained to him that this
was in the way of an earned promotion
he ducked his flat-topped head and ac-
cepted no provision was made for the
man who had lately occupied that post
he was disposed of and that was what
should have been done with the whole
management

  if roberman had only known to let
well enough continue he might have
earned another promotion but in the
nature of his situation he could not do
that he actually believed that he had
won his new post and straightway he
began to win the next one himself

  his plan of campaign would have been
brilliant too but for one defect he
contemplated rebuilding the g and t
but at that very moment the g and t
could not raise enough money for the re-
habilitation of its rolling-stock how-
ever the president listened to him with
attention canceled an order for the con-
struction of a roundhouse on the site
of one burned the month before and put
the funds thereby released at robermans
disposal

  roberman made himself the superin-

tendent of construction and calling for
a work-train went back with it to sec-
tion 

  ohalloran greeting him demanded
 aan shall i be made boss av this sic-
tion now misther roberman be way av
payin me for the rise yiz got be acci-
dint 

  roberman at length freed of the ne-
cessity of a fool to amuse still felt the
necessity of a crutch made ohalloran
his assistant and appointed raddles to
section 

  next day the rebuilding of section 
was begun roberman as chief engineer
and chief everything else-like a boy in
a mans place-had forty separate and
distinct ways of doing everything but
not having the courage to decide on any
one for any length of time whatever he
undertook he did not finish the fill be-
low the trestle on plum creek just after
he had it half finished was altogether too
expensive a piece of work he decided
likewise he quit straightening the pine
hill curve leaving it a sharper elbow
than ever

  ohalloran saw the waste of money
and opportunity and he became unman-
ageable

  among a great number of bad places
in the line the marsh curve was prob-
ably the worst of all the grapevine
canon which sometimes contained a riv-
er flanked the marsh on the west the
marsh-it was nothing but a very low
alkali flat-lay a mile wide between the
canon and the grapevine bluffs be-
cause the promoters had seen fit to come
out of the bluffs at a point across the
canon half a mile above the site for the
trestle they had strung the road across
the marsh in a great curve

  a curve anywhere is hard enough to
hold but on a slippery alkali flat the feat
is well-nigh impossible the slow or-
ders broken rails ditchings and breaks
that were always holding up traffic at that
point had rendered the marsh curve in-
famous

  when ohalloran and roberman came
to this place the new roadmaster labor-
ing under the impression that he was
what his position indicated decided to
do something on his own account any
fool of a freighter even would have
known that the way to abolish a curve
ohalloran of section 



was simply to strike straight from the
cut in the bluff squarely across the marsh
to the trestle

  but roberman knowing nothing of
ways except those already made and hav-
ing great respect for the builders of the
road determined that the marsh curve
only needed a little more ballast

be afther fixin it yiz must have the
backbone to raypudiate itlntoirely
when his recommendation was laughed
at he declared  be me sowl misther
roberman if yiz attimpt this i shall for-
ward me own riccomindations to the man-
ager wid a thrue statement av me worruk
aan the fills av section  yiz shall not

  ballast yer granny ohalloran
snorted  its ballast on the side av the
head av the mon thot laid out the line
thots naded

  and thinking of what the mistake
would cost him he expostulated  now
be plazed to stand be thot notion or yiz
will be afther ruinin me whin yiz be
foindin a misthake the loike av this dont

ruin me aan me records aan me chance be
this fools blunder

  roberman of course sent in his rec-
ommendations and as a matter of course
too ohalloran sent in his but as
ohalloran never got off the section the
only answer that came back from head-
quarters was a work-train carrying a bal-
last-gang ohalloran watched the bal-


the railroad mans magazine

lasting of the curve as another man might
have watched the dissipation of his for-
tunes he knew what would become of
it and he knew that in some way rober-
man would lay the responsibility on him

  on the second day of the work he went
into the box - car office on the temporary
siding where roberman was rolling ciga-
rettes and protested

   misther roberman i wish to praysint

strike only puffed benignantly and calm-
ly said

   i have wired in to the manager that
by six oclock to-morrow afternoon marsh
curve will be in a condition and in
spite of the curve it will be the fastest
track on the division he has wired
back that when i confirm my promise he
will start out with a fast engine and his
car and try it out you had better go
back to the work ohalloran didnt
i tell you that i expect you to see it hur-
ried 

the irishman went back all of that
afternoon he strode back and forth along
the fill watching it become more and
more dangerous every moment by morn-
ing he had arrived at this conclusion
since he had been delegated to see the
work done any  defect in it would be
charged to his neglect he saw his abil-
ity used as a stepping-stone by a fool
who would finally use him as a buffer

as the ballast - gang started out for

this fact for yiz to consider this ballast
thot yiz be so fast a puttin in is not a
goin in as it should yiz will be afther
havin the outside av the thrack the lowest
aan this curve yiz are afther makin a
bad matther worse i know it i have
been watchin

   its the way i designed it rober-
man declared with the sang-froid of an
ignoramus when he really commits him-
self  i have figured out that by hav-
ing the outside rail lowest the strain on
the inside one will be removed and there
will be no more broken rails

   rails  blazed ohalloran  rails
aan whin did it come to be proper prac-
thise to risk a wreck to save tin yarrds
av steel yiz be loony be the powers
i tould yiz wance yiz would be a nadin
a sthrong frind some toime this be
the toime 

  but roberman having gone past the
point where ohallorans shafts might

work after breakfast he once more
climbed up the step to the door of the
car on the temporary siding

  roberman was sound asleep and a
drowsing youth was sitting at the table
whereon the telegraph-key ticked its end-
less- monotony

  me by ohallorans eyes were
blazing at the thought of his opportunity
 yiz will sind a telegraft to the mana-
ger advisin him not to come wid his fast
special the thrack as dangerous
freights aan locals passin on slow
ordthers in the noight have tamped it on
the wrong soide say to him ohalloran
bids him come very slow

  the youth grinned at first but fear-
ing the look that was in the irishmans
eyes turned to the key and rattled off a
message which went nowhere because the
line was not switched in

  aan phwat does the manager say
ohalloran demanded at length


ohalloran of section 



   says hes much obliged an will mind
you to the letter

   flavin thin discharged me duty to
the road the factotum averred  i shall
resign

  going over to robermans bunk he
roused him with a rough shake and these
words  i am done wid yiz aan yer job
mistlier roberman but i shall sthay
ontil the manager comes fure he has jist
now bid me he will come slow aan be
the token av thot i take it he will be
afther wishin to see me whin he comes
i bid yiz a gude-by sor i shall go out
aan wandther along the right av way
ontil he comes along

  fie bowed and went out as majestic-
ally as a wellington

  roberman floundering out of his bunk
in a rage at being awakened for such an
outrageous cause sank back to hilarity
when the wireman told of the message
which did not go

   let the bog - trotter go then he
laughed delightedly  let him go and

i	hope the managers special runs on his
slow order and catches him on the track

  but robermans peace of mind was soon
shattered at  oclock the western
freight a fast through came lumbering
down through the cut and in slowing
for the curve came near to toppling from
the fill

  moreover when it finally reached the
trestle the engineer sent back a big and
profane fireman with a sharp and sul-
furous message the tenor of that oral
deluge was that roberman was a train-
wrecker an idiot a felon and a marked
man

  however the roadmaster knew his
rights and knowing them ordered the
fireman to be off he sent a message to
the manager requesting him to have the
division superintendent discharge the
crew on that run of the western freight
now the g and t management had
expected some outbreak or other as a re-
sult of having hired roberman and be-
ing prepared for it his request was
granted instantly

  even this balm to his feelings could
not put him altogether at his ease for
roberman after the fashion of his kind
was sure of nothing if any one-even an
enemy-doubted him

  he went out and rooked over the fill

    	r r

on marsh curve and marveled how low
the outside rail had sunk

  there is no telling what might have
happened had he run across ohalloran
then instead of meeting the irishman
he fell in with the old roadmastel now
a gang-boss the roadmaster that had
been bowed to the roadmaster who was
and adhering to his sycophancy congrat-
ulated him on his promotion and averred
that this piece of work should make him
a general official

  roberman did not stop to discuss the
matter relief from his doubts was all
he wanted and having secured it he
hurried back to his office in the car

  at two oclock in the afternoon ohal-
loran who had spent the morning on the
trestle came back to the camp for some-
thing to eat fie had expected that the
work would be stopped for he really be-
lieved that he had reached the manager
with that message but when he found
the ballasting just about completed and
the work-train leady to pull out he for-
got his hunger and went again to the
office

   misther roberman he declared
 there be something about this thot i
dont loike at all at all why did the
manager permit av yiz goin in this fool
scheme  

  the roadmaster wanted no more doubts
cast upon him for they were worrisome
since lie knew a controversy would bring
them in untold weight he evaded the
question and lied for an answer while
he was doing this he was also writing a
message to the manager this confirmed
his promise that the work would be com-
pleted he wondered if it wouldnt be
wise to modify his statement about fast
trackage and then being undecided al-
lowed the matter to stand as it was

  presently the answer came back the
manager was just leaving falls two hun-
dred miles to the west and as it was
now  he would be along at about
 roberman was advised that if any
freight should be near the curve at that
time it should be set in on the temporary
siding used by the ballast-gang

the balance of that afternoon was so
dull on the alkali flat that every one but
ohalloran went to sleep he would
have slept but for one annoying thought
why had the ballast-gang been allowed


the railroad mans magazine

to go on and finish he went out and
sat on the right of way hoping that an
extra of some kind might come along and
stop long enough to give him some in-
formation but no extra came

  as night drew near the office force in
the box car roused and began making
preparations at which the irishman mar-
veled he slipped around to the side
door and overheard roberman saying
 theyll be along in forty-five minutes
joe you take a lantern and go down the
track to the ballast-switch for theres
that way-freight to be backed in on it
its going to be close and if they dont
hurry the old man will hit them about
the time he leaves the trestle hell be
cornin onto marsh curve to-night faster
than any train that ever hit it before
ohalloran wasted no time but clam-
bering up the steps out of the dusk he
thrust his head into the door and deliv-
ered  aah  but yiz lyin booby i will
show yiz a thrick thot bates a hundthred
av thot i shall go this minute to build
a fire beyant the trestle to make them
slow down

  there are times when even fools and
cowards rise to the occasion roberman
turned to joe and dictated this message
to the manager

   the crazy irishman who protested
  against my recommendation  this
  work still objects to the work after
  you have sanctioned it and after it is
  completed he is now threatening to
  stop your train with a signal-fire on the
  other side of grapevine trestle dis-
  regard any signals that he may make
  for the track will all be clear

   yiz be afther murderin him
ohalloran shouted fiercely and he
sprang up inside the car but joe
obeying the imperious wave of rober-
mans hand snapped the switches to-
gether opened his key and rattled off the
words

  just as ohallorans heavy hand was
clutching at his wrist there roared down
from the cut the noise of a freight-train

   flag them down  yelled roberman
 flag the devil 

  joe answered they haint  time
now

   be the way they are a hittin av thot
curve there will be no nade av the flag 

ohalloran boomed down upon the two
 be loike thots the noise av it right
now 

  there came a crash like the report of
a heavy gun

  they ran over to that door of the car
which commanded the sweep of the curve
far down in the deep dusk there twinkled
many and strange lights but the silence
of night and the desert was profound it
was as if the heavy freight had been sud-
denly snatched out of existence

    its gone over the fill joe choked

   yis its gan over the fill as aany man
wid the sinse av a pig wad have known 
ohalloran reiterated

  roberman thinking only of his disap-
pointment forgot the manager and his
special it was ohalloran who first
thought of that turning to joe he said 
 tilegraft the manager thot it be toime
he listen to ohalloran sthop him 

  this time joe did not neglect to cut in
the switch but when he called for the
last station at which it was now possible
to catch the special he found the wire was
down

  roberman lolled down on the table
cursing his luck

   luck  stormed the irishman  be
loike it is luck for yiz thot the manager
will niver know phwat happint him but
if yiz wor the tinth parrt av a man yiz
would be afther doin somethin the
wreck yiz have produched has broken aff
the wire yiz must stop thim in some
other way

  he took the advice to himself leaped
to the ground caught up a spike-maul
and a pinch-bar and running off toward
the wreck shouted back to them

   come aan  come aan  nade the
hilp av both av yiz 

  roberman with his helplessness upon
him hesitated after a full ten minutes
he jumped up grabbed a lantern and
yelling at joe to follow him ran down
the track passing the wreck with 
more hesitation than he might have dis-
played had the train been on the siding
he came at length to the end of marsh
curve and grapevine trestle

  there ohalloran gigantie in the
night was wrenching at fish-plates with
his bar and etriking titan blows with his
maul

   come on   shouted roberman  we
ohalloran of section 



 must start a signal-fire on
 the other side 

    hould on  yiz have
 warned him aginst a sig-
 nal-fire  hould  the toime
 be shorn we must ditch
 thim sthraight forrurd
 aan the flat aan pray the
 saints be wid thim for
 nawthing ilse can save  

  but roberman in the
 stampede of his fears ran
 on ohalloran realizing
 that he was alone to do his
 ten-men task cracked fish-
 plates with single sweeps
 of his maul coming to a
 ten-foot rail length he
 broke it out from the grip
 of the spikes and using it
 for a lever pried over rail
 lengths of ties and tracks
 like a child at play

   hardly had robermans
 footsteps died away on the trestle than the
 job was done

   five rail lengths of track had been
 swept off the fill and pointed into the flat

   when the managers special came along
 it would plunge down the rails where
 they bent from the low embankment and
 flounder on into the marsh

   ohalloran with his breath coming in
 gasps and his senses reeling from his ter-
 rific exertions paused thankfully

   that instant a splay of white light
 shimmered and the roar of a high-speed
 engine thrummed on the night

   an instant later the headlight of the
 managers special shone clear and open at
 the top of the long grade illuminating
 it all the way down to the trestle

   in the beam of light ohalloran saw
 roberman lantern in hand half - way
 across the long bridge then he disap-
 peared

   the lantern still burned in the middle
 of the bridge but its bearer was gone
 i he watched breathlessly hoping to see
 roberman rise from some girder
 come running back

   but roberman had vanished

   the special tore across the tottering
 trestle at forty miles an hour

   ohalloran saw the lantern snuffed out
 he groaned beside the disconnected curve

   the flying engine from the west took

      his improvised derail he saw a portly
      old gentleman with white whiskers lean-
      ing far out of the left-hand window of
      the cab and the next moment he saw the
      same old gentleman shoot out of that
      window and disappear in the darkness

        then came a great thump and the hiss
      of steam as the locomotive plumped over
      on its side

         ohalloran set his teeth and strode to
       the wreck as he stood listening in the
       darkness a match was struck he saw a
       very formidable apparition appear just
       where the old gentleman had disappeared
       -formidable because it swore with ap-
       palling fluency

         it called mightily for roberman

        the matter of explaining the wreck
      and the duty of hustling to the trestle for
      the maimed body of roberman and find-
      ing him still hanging by his hands to a
      tie for fear he would fall if he attempted
      to change holds was soon accomplished

         then the president who was a fo-rmer
 mule - driver took ohalloran by the
 and -sshoulder and after the manner of the
 parental prophecy said

         young man youre the very feller
      ive been a lookin for you come with
      me i like your style for by the
      powers of mud any man that can save a
      train by ditchin it has got the business
      down to a mighty fine point

the true story series self - preservation is the first

by proving that it is not the final law f fireman cole had not
shown that courage and ingenuity came before the blind instinct to jump it
is probable that this story would never have been told though the ending
would have been much more exciting panic is one of the few things that the
mind cannot imagine without realizing consequently it is almost impossible

true story number forty-four

ride on a runaway engine
and feel that the next mo-
ment would surely be the
last for me and the crew-
that was my experience on
a prominent southeastern
railroad several years ago

  i was  my way to lynnburg a sta-
tion about one hundred miles from clif-
ton junction where i expected to catch
no  the east-bound passenger-train
as the train oil which i was traveling
from iangham was late the east-bound
train had left on its journey a few mo-
ments before i arrived at the junction

  disappointed because i was expected
to relieve the following day an operator

who was going on his annual vacation i
inquired of the operators in the main
telegraph-office what chance i had to
catch a freight

  i was informed that a light engine
no  would leave immediately fol-
lowing no  for a station near lynn-
burg at which a freight-train had been
wrecked

  hastening to the railroad yards i
sought engineer mcdonald who was to
have charge of the light engine but was
informed by him that  there was noth-
in doin  that it was strictly against
the rules to allow any one to ride on the
engine without a permit from some head
official

a ride on a runaway



  rather disheartened i started back to
the passenger station when the engineer
called me back

   whats your name and whats your
big hurry he demanded

  i modestly informed him that my name
was mccoy and that the telegraph oper-
ator for the road at lynnburg had al-
ready left that city on his vacation un-
der the impression that i would arrive
on no  to relieve him

   well ill wait a minute run up and
see the super said mcdonald

  i rushed up to the office of the super-
intendent and securing the much-need-
ed permit quickly presented myself to
mcdonald shoving the necessary bit of
paper under his nose

  he quickly called  all aboard  land
we were off

  the crew aboard the
engine was composed
of engineer mcdon-
ald fireman cole

conductor j ones

brakemen kane and
hill and myself

  at the invitation of
fireman cole i took
a seat on his box and
as i did so i overheard
a remark by one of the
crew that the  was
the third successive en-
gine to be started out
to the scene of the
wreck i did not think
much of the incident at
the time but afterward
its s i gn if icance
came to me with re-
doubled force

   ever take a ride on
a light engine before

mccoy  inquired mc-
donald

   no sir i said

  on leaving clifton
junction and passing
the bend on the oppo-
site side of the river
the engineer jocularly
remarked that he would
show his passenger a
 touch of high life
and opened wide the
throttle along the

banks of the river the engine went with
rapidly increasing speed

   better look out for no  mac
suggested coie  she might get hung up
before she reaches mount wilson
acting upon this suggestion and fear-
ing that for some reason the passenger-
train ahead might have stopped at some
one of the many curves along the line
the engineer decided to slow up

  to his great surprise the throttle was
immovable alarmed for the safety of
all aboard mcdonald attempted to pull
back  on center  with the reverse-lever
the result was disastrous however the
 dog  snapped off and the reverse-bar
began whisking back arid forth with in-
creasing speed

  the engineer astride the mechanism

 it would be sure death to take the leap


the railroad mans magazine

to break open the doors was but the work
of a moment

tried his best to control the engine but
to no purpose finally his wrestling
with the bar resulted in an injury to one
of his legs

   great scott mccoy i believe macs
leg is broken said cole  help me lift
him off this place

  together we lifted the engineer from
the vicinity of the jerking lever and
placed him upon the coal - pile in the
tender

  meanwhile we were speeding on to
what seemed certain death and destruc-
tion luckily for us all the regular
scheduled trains were few in number and
our only fear aside from a tail-end col-
lision with passenger no  was a head-
ender with no  the west-bound pas-
senger this train was however report-
ed about two hours late previous to our
departure from clifton junction

  during the excitement attending the
accident by which the engineer was in-
jured the engine shot forward with in-
creasing momentum fearing that it
might leave the track at any moment i
grabbed my satchel and started to jump
off on the side next the river but was re-
strained by cole who assured me that it
would be sure death to take the leap

  rocking from pilot to tender and
swaying from side to side the engine
went whizzing by telegraph - poles and
switch-lights with here and there a high
bluff at a speed sometimes exceeding it
seemed ninety miles an hour

  meanwhile the conductor and his two
brakemen had remembered the first law
of nature - self-preservation - and had
clambered over the tender to the brake-
beam in the rear where they at least
hoped to secure an easy fall

  to the brake-beam for me ejacu-
lated jones as he made his way over the
coal-pile of the rocking engine

   me too said kane who was quick-
ly followed by hill

   guess we wont have to fall very far
anyway if we do go remarked hill

   its farther than i want to fall at
that remarked jones as a settlement of
further argument

  while the other members of the crew
were seeking safety on the back end the
fireman began demonstrating his re-
sourcefulness first by turning on  full 
the injectors then taking a hammer
he proceeded to smash the  pop-off the
whistle having previously been tied down
to sound warning notes from the time of
the discovery that the engine was un-
controllable

  cole with my assistance then pulled
the fire from under the boiler after which
the progress of the engine became slower
and slower until finally just at dusk it
came to a dead stop about a mile from
mount wilson station

  every member of the party heaved a
deep sigh of relief as their feet touched
the ground again

  but our troubles were not yet ended
a ride on a runaway



upon learning that mount wilsona tele-
graph station was only a mile away i
suggested that some member of the crew
walk with me to that place rather than
wait to flag some passing train

  it was decided that the conductor
should remain with the engineer each
of the brakemen took up a position the
regulation flagging distance from the now
dead engine while the fireman and my-
self walked to mount wilson which sta-
tion was however only open during the
daylight hours

  arriving there we found that the
agent-operator had left for a neighboring
village to attend a dance and would not
return until late thinking perhaps the
agent might have left behind the keys to
the station we inquired at his boarding-
place but were informed that our only
chance to secure entry to the telegraph-
office lay in our awaiting the return of
the operator from his frolic

  at this juncture the fireman again
showed his cleverness

    heres a rail fence kid  i guess that
will help some he said

  to secure a heavy rail and break open
the intervening doors was but the work
of a moment after our forcible entry
i heard the despatcher calling stations
down the line in an endeavor to find out
what had become of no 

  not waiting to seat myself at the tele-
graph-table i reached over to the key
and attempted to  butt in  upon the
despatcher to inform him of our preca-
rious situation

  i was not familiar with the calls for
the different offices along the road ex-

cept that of the despatchers office and
when i attempted to signal

  to di- he jerked out at me
 get out will you  

  finally the wire became clear for a
time and i had an opportunity to ex-
plain our unfortunate accident to the
despatcher at  di

  requesting me to stay close by he
called bellows falls another junction
point and asked him if engine  could
quickly be gotten ready for a relief run
on being informed that it could the des-
patcher told the operator to call out a
crew in double-quick time and hustle
them to mount wilson at the same time
putting out an order giving them right
over all trains

  meantime the despatcher had notified
all east-bound trains to approach the
scene of the wrecked engine carefully
and to be on the lookout for a flag foh
lowing it with an order to me to hold all
west-bound trains until further orders

  no  had been having troubles of her
own with her steam and with hot boxes
and before she reached mount wilson the
 had arrived and had towed the dead
engine to a side track

  on the arrival of no  at the scene
the coifductor was placed aboard her
while the remainder of the crew followed
on a west-bound freight

  when  a fast east-bound freight
came along i boarded the caboose with-
out waiting to apologize to the agent for
breaking open his office as i landed on
the cushions in the rear of the car i men-

the rogers group no 

the railroad
machinist

by robert h rogers

no man is better able to tell of the wonderfully picturesque time-from
the shopmens point of view-between the very old days and the
present than is mr rogers the attractive period of the shops the
period when romance and picturesqueness were an integral part of the life
was the period of twenty and thirty years ago

    now the machinist is a man trained to take his place in any department
but at last arriving at the time when he must make a definite choice of the one
in which he will make his future to be an all-around man is an impossibility

   when once he has made his choice as an apprentice he becomes a
specialist all his faculties concentrated on mastering a branch of the ma-
chinists trade which in itself is as complicated and demands a wider knowledge
of the inwardness of more mysterious things than did the whole range of the
trade in the days of the skilful picturesque  journeyman

in this age of specialization the young machinist is being educated
for a career of great usefulness why the round-
house attracts men

    ik few years back they always
referred to the railroad
machinist as a  journey-
man and this appella-
tion of endearing memo-
ries dear at least to the
older fellows who may read this article
has not even yet slipped into the appa-
rent oblivion toward which so many tra-
ditions of the past in this stirring busi-
ness seem to be unfortunately tending

the railroad machinist has become a
power in the land and the now unfamiliar

began in the april railroad mans

 journeyman  served a long way toward
this end drop it at any time when in
confab with some power that is of the
road whose experience antedates the past
decade or so and you will make a friend
of him or you will awaken his interest
anyhow and that is a whole lot to which
you will readily testify if you ever had
dealings with a busy motive-power boss

  the old name came up unthinkingly
not so long ago when the writer was in
conversation with a prominent mechan-
ical superintendent

magazine single copies  cents
the railroad machinist



   i wish he said  when on your
travels you would pick me up a few good
journeymen to round out the gang i
have i need them- and then the
same thought seized us and we smiled
reminiscently and happily

  the designation inadvertent of course
was nevertheless a true echo from the
past each of us in days gone by had
been journeymen and the recollection vi-
brated one of the sympathetic chords
which make the world akin

  in the period when a boy who in shop
vernacular  got free or completed his
apprenticeship the established precedent
was to quit shortly afterward and to seek
elsewhere experience which the home
field through possible limitations in size
or scope of work handled could not af-
ford needless to add this was long be-
fore the comprehensive system now in
vogue of educating apprentices for fu-
ture benefit to their own shop was even
dreamed of

  now this errantry has fallen into dis-
repute largely because there is nothing to
be gained by it with the railroads spend-
ing annually vast sums to train their
young men to particular ideas for sub-
sequent exemplification it would be a
poor investment indeed to make the fu-
ture of the apprentice so unattractive
that some other road would get the bene-
fit of this elaborate instruction

moving west to the money

  it was different then primarily the
machinists pay wasnt there instances
are plentiful on many roads not so far
from the atlantic coast where in the
early nineties embryo machinists were
started in as low as one dollar and sev-
enty-five cents per day

  the proper compensation for a grad-
uate apprentice was certainly not in the
east although it was known to be in the
west and furthermore the opportuni-
ties for advancement were lacking be-
cause these favorable considerations were
in the west or elsewhere eight out of
every ten apprentices when  through
their time utilized what was left of their
bounty after a few days of time-honored
and winked-at jollification to get west
or at least out of town

  the two who remained were derisive-

ly scoffed at as  home guards   and no
matter how good they might have been
at their trade were forced to take the
leavings of the good jobs in deference to
possibly less able hands who nevertheless
possessed the inestimable advantage im-
pressive to foreman and master mechanic
alike of having  worked around some

  this is how the term  journeyman 
came to be applied to machinists and
some of these journeymen found the life
of the road so attractive and the knowl-
edge that they had sufficient ability to
make good in any shop between the rising
and the setting sun so consoling that they
never did return to the home shop and
are journeymen still after these many
years

passing of the picturesque

  by easy transition journeymen become
 boomers and to what is known of the
boomers and their wanderings we owe all
that there is of the romantic and pic-
turesque in the railroad machinists call-
ing

  there is an element certainly pathetic
tragic almost to the old railroaders in
the passing of the boomer machinist and
of his brother the boomer boilermaker
no doubt hundreds of a new generation
still roam in desultory fashion the many
iron trails west of the big river but the
familiar names will be recalled only by
the veterans who may read these lines

  they have one by one dropped from
the dilapidated roundhouses and tumble-
down back shops which of yore charac-
terized the desert country the region
of the rio grande replete with stories
of their escapades knows them no more
but they will ever be associated with the
days when machinists must perforce
travel for money and experience

  is there a master mechanic from par-
sons kansas to the golden gate and
from seattle to the southern boundary of
old mexico who has not encountered

gate on the western part of the map at
least

  at el paso or in c p diaz you
might have found only ten years ago
these boomers of a truly remarkable pe-
riod perhaps some of you have been
there and knew these fellows well may-
be worked with them for all the writer
knows and if you are thus intimately
acquainted this story will ring true for
you

some of the lovable characters

  you will remember that mr lawler in
spite of eccentricities was considered by
all the foremen in the great southwest to
be the best machinist in the world and
you know of the things which he has
done certainly you have not forgotten
that  bum  dailey never owned a coat
or if he did he never wore it and does
there not remain a vague impression of
his denim pants inadequately secured
about the waist-line with a trunk or bag-
gage strap

  remember how  bum  blew into al-
buquerque new mexico once upon a
time looking so much on the bum that
george hancock then master mechanic
and a very neat fellow himself by the
way wouldnt give him a job simply on
account of his appearance badly as he
needed good boilermakers

   you dont look right bum he said
 youve got those same old linen pants
on or whatever they are made of that
you had when you worked here six months
ago the sleeve is torn out of your shirt
and i can see your red hair sticking
through your hat

   id be ashamed of myself to disgrace
the business with you trot along to the
colorado midland and come back here
when you get fixed up

   what do you want george han-
cock retorted old bum do you
want a suit of clothes or do you want a
boilermaker  and he went to work as
he had done many times for both george
and billy hancock and continued to do
for the asking until the bell finally rang
for him

  have you forgotten that  windy 
lane was the only itinerant machinist
who carried tools can you think
now what they were half of a be-

grimed two-foot rule a pair of inside and
outside calipers a hook scriber and a
center punch small kit but windy
secured many a roundhouse cupboard on
the old mexican central where cup-
boards were at a premium then as they
are now simply on the argument that he
must have a place where his tools would
be safe

  what could he do with these elemen-
tary implements worth in the aggregate
about fifty cents there was nothing
which he could not do on a locomotive
from the ground up and his ability al-
though he remained in a shop only from
one pay-day to another and often not
that long wtas so conceded that a job
was his in any shop from paducah to
barstow

  bill ritchie was a boomer but he was
a credit to the trade of the boilermaker
he forsook at last the role of a bird of
passage although few of those briefly
mentioned have done so and recently he
passed away while in the responsible po-
sition of general foreman boilermaker on
the erie railroad

  he could narrate incidents connected
with his contemporaries of the past and
refer complacently even to experiences
of his own in a way which the writer
knows has served to convulse with laugh-
ter some of the highest officials of the
railroad during an informal session
when somebodys private car was backed
off along the line somewhere

  there is much amusing of course in
such reminiscences even our personal
adverse experiences become humorous
after time has removed their poignancy
but after all there was hard work and
grief in profusion in following the busi-
ness during the period referred to and
there was little to choose from in this re-
gard between what might be found in the
home shop or elsewhere

no labor-saving devices

  the trade of a journeyman machinist
say twenty years ago was not the trade
of to-day and with which this article
properly has to deal there were few if
any labor-saving devices no traveling-
cranes capable of raising a one-hundred-
ton engine bodily wheels and all to do
with as you list
the railroad machinist



  engines had to be jacked up and with
more or less refractory screw-jacks at
that very few valve-seat planers were
in evidence

  when a seat had to be trued and this
was quite a common operation before the
advent of the balanced slide-valve there
was no alternative but to go after it with
a hammer and chisel until down to where
a file could complete the job

  this chipping a seat was no slouch of
a job either and it is entitled to a little
special mention it is doubtful if one
machinist in fifty of the present day could
do it that is in the time in which such
things were supposed to be done then

the great work of art

  it was necessary to take an even chip
over the entire seat an area of say
twelve by sixteen inches and the least
miscalculation in the angle on which the
chisel was held must inevitably result in
a terrific gouge which might require
hours with a file to get out

  there was no guide whatever but the
steady eye and hand- and yet the writer
has seen this cut so perfectly taken that
less than twenty minutes filing would be
required to have the seat ready for the
valve to be spotted down

  it was a proud day for any ambitious
young man to be entrusted with this job
because if was a concession to his ability
as a mechanic

  if studs or stay-bolts had to be re-
moved from boilers they must be trimmed
off even with the sheet and the portion
then remaining chipped out there was
no air-drill which you can procure from
the tool-room now for the asking and
which will take care of a dozen bolts
while you are cutting out one

  when cylinders had to be reboltedsuch
of the old bolts which would not back
out had to be removed by drilling and
drilled with a hand ratchet the holes
were made ready for the new bolts by
reaming in the same crude way and
when cylinders were rebored the wheel
operating the mechanism of the boring-
bar was turned patiently and laboriously
by hand not to mention that it mustnt
stop when the last cut was going through

  a hammer monkey-wrench and chisel
were the foundation tools of a machinists

kit and the only other implements con-
sidered as really necessary were a two-
foot rule a pair of outside calipers and
a pair of inside calipers these were
sufficient with what you or your helper
could borrow to make a very creditable
showing in the roundhouse end of it for
machine-hands add a thread-gage sur-
face-gage pair of dividers center punch
and a square

  the majority of these fellows made
their own tools generally while passing
through the period of apprenticeship and
some of their creations remain as endu-
ring monuments to patience and inge-
nuity take those solid steel squares for
instance with six or eight inch blade and
heavy butt which were the pride of all
machinists to own and the dream of
every apprentice to make

  they were so cleverly put together
that the eye unaided could not distin-
guish either the joints of the parts or the
heads of the countersunk rivets which
united them it was a mark of distinc-
tion for a man to have made the working
implements of his trade and the majority
did so even to their treasured ball-pein
hammer

hogging  the tools

  one of the most annoying features
with which a boomer had to contend was
the dearth of wrenches etc actually re-
quired for the daily work at hand on
account of no tool-room system in those
days-in fact no tool-rooms except in
polite misnomer-the  home guards 
had the wrenches sledges spring-pull-
ers and blocking and occasionally even
such of the screw-jacks which would
work locked up in cupboards or hid away
somewhere

  this was where the regular hands who
stuck by the shop had the best of the
floating element but the boomers had the
names of shops where a dearth of tools
existed entered in their notes and did not
work in them unless they had to in order
to reach the next place

  there was no such thing as a specialist
during this period when a boy was out
of his time he was known as a machinist
and was presumed to be equally compe-
tent in roundhouse back-shop or ma-
chine-shop


the railroad mans magazine

  a journeyman was familiar with the
air-brake that is he tackled the jobs on
pumps and triples in due course if they
appeared on the roundhouse work-book
-ie was also supposed to possess a smat-
tering at least of what the present-day
pipe-fitter is paid to handle exclusively

  he was a blacksmith in a way be-
cause he would invariably dictate to the
tooldresser the desired color to which
the temper of his chipping-chisels should
be drawn and he was also a bit of a car-
penter as he had to get out the blocks
to put under the engines when the wheels
were removed and to fill the ports in the
valve-seats of the cylinders

could do anything

  they were truly worthy of the title-
 all-around men certainly the pic-
turesque boomers were it wouldnt do
for one of the latter to strike a town
where a dearth of machine-men was in
evidence and take the next freight out
simply because the bulk of his experience
had been in the roundhouse end of it

  these gentlemen passed with equal fa-
cility into any department where an
opening existed and as a rule they de-
livered the goods too while they stayed
there even if the stay was limited

  this is the great contrast between then
and now and is the point where proper-
ly the story of the modern railroad ma-
chinist should begin the business has
of late years become largely if not en-
tirely specialized

the four groups

  the trade so far as the railroad is con-
cerned might be boldly divided into four
great groups machine-hands who trans-
form the rough product of the foundry
or blacksmith-shop into the finished ar-
ticle for repairs or renewals floor-men
who assemble these parts into the com-
plete locomotive whether a new or a thor-
oughly repaired one in the erecting or
back-shop roundhouse-men who make
the repairs necessary to maintain the loco-
motive in service until its mileage runs up
to a total entitling it to a place in the
back-shop for general overhauling and
tool-room and air-brake hands who make
and repair all the tools used in the va-

rious departments repair the parts of the
air-brake in entirety and also the va-
rious auxiliaries of the locomotives such
as injectors pops whistles and gage-
cocks

specialists now the rule

  it is an almost unknown procedure
now for a machinist engaged in any one
of the above departments to be ordered
to do even temporary work in one of the
others mentioned yet the time is not so
far removed when if work became slack
in the machine-shop the men would be
instructed to report to the roundhouse
foreman or if there happened to be a
wreck on the line and the engines were
delayed arriving at the roundhouse for
their daily attention some of the incum-
bents of the latter would run a lathe
planer or boring-mill until normal con-
ditions in their individual line had been
restored

  the division of machinists work into
branches as heretofore indicated and
the coming of the specialists had its
origin coincident with the tremendous de-j
velopment of the locomotive which began
about  previous to that time there
had been a period of say fifty years dur-
ing which no improvements to speak of
were made in either equipment shops or
shop practises

  locomotives of one generation were to
all intent and purpose merely duplica-
tions of what had gone before the way
mechanics had themselves learned to do
the various jobs whether on machines or
at the bench was so taught by them to
the apprentices that is if they had the
inclination to teach them anything at all
as there was no compulsion for them to
do so

  unless in the instance of some par-
ticular shop which may have been pre-
sided over by a young and progressive
master mechanic there was no initiative
in evidence and little attempt at original
research on the part of the men to im-
prove on time-honored procedure

the difference of conditions

  this may afford a reason for the  all-
around  machinist or in other words
the versatility of the journeymen and
boomers of the period a quality which in
the railroad machinist



the degree exhibited then would to-day
be simply impossible of attainment they
could easily be all-around men because
there was little to get around

  outside of the painful lack of labor-
saving devices which necessarily called
for a much superior degree of skill and
judgment than is now requisite to be a
successful machinist there were really
only a few important jobs

  any old-timer if you talk to him about
it will get these down to five viz chip-
ping a valve-seat hanging or lining four-
bar guides setting valves filing or re-
ducing back end of main rod brasses and
patching a broken cylinder and if you
once learned thoroughly these operations
no matter where you went in the country
to work they were exactly the same be-
cause all locomotives were alike

  all were single expansion outside cyl-
inders narrow fire-boxes eight coupled
wheels for freight four coupled for pas-
senger  so very similar in fact to those
you served your time  that barring the
inscriptions on their tanks you might
have imagined yourself back home

  andy mcwilliams a veteran of the
southwest truthfully defined it when the
writer sought advice from this nestor
prior to his first essay into the unknown
as a jour

   dont lose your nerve boy the
only things you will find different from
here are the mens names and the engine
numbers

complications and progress

  now we have both simple and com-
pound engines single articulated and
geared even there are compounds of
the four-cylinder type with a high and
low-pressure cylinder  each side of
the cross-over type with high-pressure
cylinder on one side and the mammoth
low-pressure on the other  tandem com-
pounds with a high and low-pressure
cylinder  each side arranged in tandem
fashion one ahead of the other and still
again of the balanced type with high-
pressure cylinders between the frames
driving a cranked axle and low-pressure
cylinders outside the frames driving the
wheels direct as originally constructed

  then if the complication herein enu-
merated does not suffice to cap the cli-

max might be added articulated com-
pounds-monsters weighing over two
hundred tons for the engine without the
tender two engines in one although sup-
plied by the same boiler

  the comparatively simple stephenson
link motion of which in every detail the
majority of the boomers were masters is
now largely supplanted by the unfamiliar
walschaert valve-gear steam super-
heaters have been introduced within the
suioke-boxes solid brass driving-boxes
which with their finished weight of but
one hundred and fifty pounds were am-
ple twenty-five years ago to support their
load have given way to cast-steel boxes
weighing over four hundred pounds

  passing of the  particular  jobs

  cast-steel frames and wheel centers
have succeeded the wrought iron and cast
iron of yore tender tanks have grown
in water capacity from three thousand
gallons to eight thousand and even ten
thousand gallons

  the five  particular  jobs to which
the old-timer may have referred with
much complacence now number five hun-
dred each requiring the equal and exact-
ing care

   if a boomer were to start now over
the circuit which many of us have worked
again and again he would scarcely find
a similar type of locomotive in two of all
the shops he would strike

  no one man could ever become master
of the wealth of detail which these facts
imply consequently the all-around man
passed as have passed his still loved and
venerated  particular  jobs both vic-
tims of the development of the country
and the increased traffic conditions neces-
sary to meet it

  roughly speaking it requires the ex-
penditure of  per year to take care
of each and every locomotive owned by
any railroad of this  for general
repairs which heavy service usually ren-
ders arbitrary at the expiration of each
twelve months and a like amount to pay
for the attention which it must receive
daily during the intervening period

  on a railroad owning  locomo-
tives this would reach the formidable
sum of nearly half a million dollars for
labor and material incidental to shop and


the railroad mans magazine

roundhouse operations alone not to men-
tion the oil and supplies or the pay of
the engineers and firemen

the most important trade

  although some eight or ten trades are
represented among those who benefit by
this amount in wages it is safe to say
that an even half of it is disbursed to
machinists alone not in anyway de-
rogatory to the importance in the general
scheme of the boilermaker molder or
blacksmith the fact remains that this is
the predominating trade as it has long
been recognized as the most conspicuous

  to combat the problem of prompt
economical and adequate repairs to power
which has assumed so much complication
necessitates resources beyond the concep-
tion of those who fought it out only a
quarter of a century ago

  the philadelphia and reading rail-
way has recently completed shops at
reading pennsylvania which may well
serve to illustrate these requirements
this magnificent plant can turn out over
one hundred locomotives per month of
which twenty might be new ones

  in fact so broad is the conception of
the problem in that quarter that the pol-
icy of the motive-power department of
this company as recently outlined to the
writer by its mechanical superintendent
h d taylor is to be entirely self-sup-
porting they have not for a long time
purchased a single item connected with
the maintenance of cars or locomotives
not even the tubes used in the boilers

shops of the new era

  in a somewhat less degree this innova-
tion of the last decade or so is in evidence
all over the country the baltimore and
ohio has vast possibilities in its mount
clare shops located in baltimore cover-
ing an area of sixty-five acres and the
mammoth establishment of the lehigh
valley at sayre pennsylvania cannot
only take care of the annual repairs to all
of its rolling-stock but has facilities to
add new locomotives should necessity
arise

  the old poorly lighted and tumble-
down machine-shops landmarks and in-
dexes in the past to railroad terminals

with their antiquated lathes and planers
shapers and single-bar boring-mills-all
driven from one line shaft-have been re-
placed by immense structures scientific-
ally illuminated and ventilated and every
machine of maybe one thousand with its
independent motor-drive

  gang-drills capable of drilling a doz-
en holes simultaneously have taken the
place of the venerated drill-press with
its single spindle and wofully battered
drill-table gang-slotters with four and
even six heads plow industriously in
shaping pedestals  half a dozen frames
piled one on top of another and hori-
zontal mills dispose of the bore of a dri-
ving-box in an even eight minutes from
start to finish an operation which on the
face-plate of a lathe formerly required
at least an hour

  where work had to be laid out before
and prick-punched with the utmost care
along the lines where metal had to be re-
moved jigs and templates do it now
with one of these clamped on the job it
only remains to run the drill through its
case-hardened holes thus removing the
human fallibility of the  layer-out  to
err

the apprentices choice

  planers have grown andgrown until
they will handle the machining of fifteen
driving-boxes with the one chucking  and
one ingenious machine when intelligent-
ly operated will even properly locate and
cut the eccentric keyways in an axle long
before the wheels are put under the en-
gine

  specialization on the part of the ma-
chinist must be incidental to this revolu-
tion although it might be inferred from
the broad general training of the appren-
tice outlined in a previous article that
the reverse was intended to result from
his education

  this however is not the idea the
apprentice is given experience in machine-
shop erecting-shop and roundhouse not
with the expectation that he will be
equally competent in all departments
when out of his time but in order that he
may have opportunity to decide on the
one most appealing to him

  very little acumen is required on the
part of the shop supervision after a boy
receives his certificate of apprenticeship
the railroad machinist



to determine whether he is best fitted for
a machine or a floor-hand if this deci-
 sion should be unsatisfactory to the grad-
uate in many shops he is allowed to make
his own selection

  those who are assigned or elect to
follow the machine-shop end of it are
placed on a machine at day wages from
 in the-east to  in the west or
on piece-work at what they can earn
whether day or piecework however it
is known to the shop management from
carefully prepared statistics based on ac-
tual time studies of all the operations
just how much each machine should turn
out in a working day and needless to
add it is insisted that this output be
maintained

  this fs the cleanest and apparently to
the majority of machinists the most at-
tractive subdivision of the trade the
 floor or erecting end is rougher and
certainly requires more physical effort

  although the shops are now equipped
with overhead cranes for raising the en-
gines and portable cranes for handling
cylinder-heads steam-chests and other
heavy parts there is still much lifting to
be done

   previous to  there was not a cylin-
der-head which the writer could not un-
assisted take from the floor and put on
the studs and few main or side rods
which his helper and himself could not
carry on their shoulders to the machine-
shop  but now some of these main rods
weigh over a thousand pounds and the
cylinder heads are so cumbersome and so
buried behind other parts as to be un-
mentionable

the erecting-shop

  the erecting-shop machinist has his
work confined to assembling the parts as
they are delivered whether new or re-
paired by the machine-shop further
specialization is in evidence in this de-
partment for instance one man or a
gang will handle the pistons guides and
cross-heads another the steam-pipes and
still another the springs

  regular men are always assigned to the
exclusive work of setting up engines that
is adjusting the backbone of the ma-
chine the cylinders and frames and
there is always a valve-gang charged

solely with hanging the motion work and
setting the valves these men receive
about similar compensation to the ma-
chine-hands

   the exacting end and likely the most
vital to the general scheme is the work
performed by the roundhouse machinist
it is the hardest branch of the trade
hardest from any viewpoint physically
and mentally

  the machine-men and the fioor-hands
follow a certain routine that is they
can closely estimate at the close of each
day what is ahead for the next but no
living mortal can foretell what an engi-
neer will put down on a roundhouse
work-book what he does indite may be
reality hobby or supposition but be it
as it may the machinist must give equal
effort in repairing the defect if it exists
or demonstrating the fallacy of the writ-
ten report if it does not

the disenchanting roundhouse

   the principal items requiring attention
on locomotives between runs in the ma-
chinists line are the elimination of
 blows whether in cylinders valves or
steam-pipes leaky piston or valve-steam
packing broken springs hot or loose rod
brasses or bushings and injector troubles
none of these are easy jobs on account
of the conditions and the environment
which attends them

   in the first place the majority of the
parts to be worked on in the roundhouse
are hot as naturally might be expected
with the engine fresh off the road ma-
king the handling of them equally iden-
tified with dexterity and profanity the
interior of the roundhouse no matter how
modern it may be is disenchanting

   it is all grease smoke and dirt pools
of water miniature lakes sometimes in-
undate the uneven flooring steam hisses
from innumerable leaks in blower-line
and other piping incidental to the estab-
lishment and pandemonium reigns gen-
erally through the discord created by
open blow-off cocks and a myriad stack-
blowers operating in unison

  these features may not be applicable
to all roundhouses but they may readily
be identified with seventy-five per cent at
least it is a curious fact that in the gen-
eral rehabilitation of repair plants which
	the railroad mans magazine

has been effected that the roundhouse has
always been the last department to re-
ceive attention

  the roundhouses stood still while the
locomotives which they were intended to
house grew and grew without doubt
at this writing half the roundhouses in
this country are so out of date that when
a modern locomotive enters one of them
the doors cannot be closed behind it
you can imagine what this implies in the
dead of winter to the fellows working on
the shoes and wedges in the pits

  these few instances of the general dis-
comfort inseparably connected with
roundhouses may serve to explain why the
lot of the roundhouse machinist is a hard
proposition but it has nevertheless
proved the most attractive to many men
waiving the slight increase in compen-
sation over the machine and back-shop
this is because the work is always new

  no roundhouse man with his heart in
his work ever knew a long day you
never know what is coming in the way of
a job or what difficulties will present
with it it maintains interest all the time

  as a rule roundhouse machinists are
versatile they can handle anything in
the line of that work and it would be
difficult in this department to build up
an adequate organization of specialists
the historic boomers were at the bottom
and in heart roundhouse men

  of course they could tackle a machine
or a vise job but they dug out what they
knew-filing brasses lining wedges and
grinding steam-pipe joints it is a de-
partment which develops resourcefulness

  no two jobs on the same part even
are ever duplicates and each and every

one requires more than the conceded al-
lotment of judgment and good temper if
the engine must go out on its run which
it generally must unless there is a pre-
vailing dearth of extra power

   the machinists trade as a whole is a
good one a bright boy makes no mis-
take in learning it but it is no field for
a  jughead it pays well too and is
improving all the time in this regard

  the two dollars per day which the
writer received twenty years ago for all-
around work has grown to three dollars
and twenty-five cents per day in that
same shop they are paying on the san-
ta fe four dollars and twenty-five cents
in all shops west of albuquerque and
there is a bonus system besides in which
a machinists daily pay is guaranteed and
he can make as much more than that as
his ability will allow

  it is the trade through which the
roundhouse foremen general foremen
master mechanics and mechanical super-
intendents all make their way to the top
it is safeguarded also in these pros-
perous times in a way little short of mar-
velous to an old-timer

   it has its own and powerful organiza-
tion the international association of
machinists which is strong enough to se-
cure working agreements with railroad
companies practically dictating compen-
sation hours of labor and defining what
constitutes machinists work

  just so long as stuff remains to be
transported from one point to another
the steam locomotive will be there to haul
it that locomotive will require the same
old repairs and the railroad machinist
will be there to make them

    in the next article in this series which will appear in our june issue mr rogers will
describe the occupation of a roundhouse foreman

x
when trouble gives the
high-sign

by richard maxwell win an s

when a black cat crosses my right-of-way i back up and take another
track says the old-time news butcher after reviewing the incidents
of a trip in which disaster spiked all the switches and kept a firm
hand on an open throttle fortunately good luck sat on the pilot and did
her best to keep our friend from a derail but the value of live-stock went up
by magic in that section by the time the claim-agent heard of it all but
butchs memories of trouble are sometimes merry especially you will think
so in the case where the trouble was of his own making-for somebody else

butch lays off his run and gets into clear long enough to tell us
how he gave the big hole to an expressmans conceit and
pulled through a remarkable days run

hat was back in  i
 was  butchin  then and i
 aint likely to forget some
 of the rough-and-itumble
 experiences and escapes i
 had while i was holding
 down that job either

   i didnt just exactly run away from
home to take up the job of a newsboy 
the railroad but my parents opposed my
going so much that it almost amounted to
the same thing it resolved itself into a
simple matter of-allowing me to have my
own way with the hope that t would get
some of the starch taken out of me without
serious mishap as my grandfather had
previously -iredicted that i was born to
be hung  suppose they felt that i was
immune from wrecks and such things

   on the third days run my faith in the
old mans prophecy was strengthened con-
siderably we were just entering a stretch
of track that has the lehighs snake trail
looking like a straightaway and i was
just passing from one coach to another
with my arms full of magazines all un-

	r r	osg

aware of the curves ahead some of which
were mighty near angles

    i closed the door behind me and stood
for a moment both arms about the bundle
breathing deeply of the fresh summer air
when a voice called my name so sharply in
my ear above the roar of the train that i
turned to see who it was only to face
space

a ghostly warning

   following my name there came the
words equally distinct hold fast-be
quick

   my fingers had only closed on the
brake wheel when we hit a sharp curve
that pulled me off my feet threw me to
my knees on the step and sent the maga-
zines in a wild flipflap out over the fields
well maybe grandpap was right

     was hooked up with the union news-
company working out of cincinnati and
my runs were over the cincinnati hamil-
ton and dayton to toledo and over the
monon to chicago


the railroad mans magazine

   news  butchering  those days wasnt
any rosy-hued pipe-dream  leastwise not
so that you would recognize the brand
more than a train-length away especially
when a fellow had the hard luck to be
under the devils own kind of a superin-
tendent that i had over me

   sometimes when i get on a double-
headed grouch i think of him and almost
wish he has made his last run and that
ill live to be good enough not to go
where he did the boys had to put up a
deposit of ten plunks and keep that much
up all the time

   well hed manage to steal the deposit
regular about every four weeks on the
check up thats why i can advisedly say
i was  hooked up

little home  touches

   i dont remember his name and im
glad of it we worked on commission
and  know that what was left to me after
he got his mitt on the rake-off was just
about enough to pay for a fifteen-cent bed
at the south end of the line-i slept in a
sided coach at the north end-and buy a
ten-cent table dliotc on state occasions
with a run in at a free-lunch in between

   well i didnt care those days for i
had a good home back on the farm to go
to whenever i felt like sidetracking the
job but like any other kid of fifteen or
so that had been feeding his steam-dome
on high-pressure dime-novels from the
time he could appreciate real classy ro-
mance of that elevating order i was out
for the adventure of the thing and before
i quit i washanded a whole stomach full
it didnt come on a silver platter either

   meantime as a matter of necessity i
was writing very  touching  letters to
pater that always brought real cash money
from home to meet such expenses as my
niggardly commissions on sales failed to
cover

a good-natured kid

   i have iorgotten the names of most of
the different engine and train men  but i
remember that i was such a good-natured
kid always willing to do anything for
them from carrying water and repacking
a hot box to taking tickets or running the
engine that they were all my good friends

   there was one old razor-back ex-
press messenger though that i had a run
in with once that didnt seem to couple up
with me very friendly it was what was
then known as the enquirer paper train
run on sundays up to toledo

the messenger with a grouch

   the messenger who had the run be-
fore they put this old grouch on was a
good fellow and i used to help him make
his running deliveries of the large bundles
of papers from the car-door as we shot
through the smaller towns that train
was out to make time not stops except at
junctions and large cities where great
truck-loads were dumped

   well the first morning that old goat
took the run out i came down to the ex-
press-cars where the papers were being
loaded under the messengers direction
from the big trucks and drays of the
different newspapers after the last of
the line had cleared away i went to the
car-door to ask for my  train  papers as
usual

   it was about three-thirty and still
pretty dark around the sheds so i didnt
notice the change of men when billy
was on and the racket in the yards too
dense to cut by hollerin i just whistled a
couple of times and billvd shove my
bundles which he always set aside out to
the car door

   i tore off a few tettrizzani highs
without getting him on the wireless so i
ripped off a few yards of paint from the
inside of that express-car with a whistle
loud and shrill and piercing enough to
rouse the sleeping community for a block
around

laying the trouble-train

   well say if old whiskers had been
coupled up with one of them electrical
slot-machines when turned up full in the
corner and somebodyd dropped in a
nickle and cut it loose on him he wouldnt
have set up and took notice any more
sudden he just let out two grunts and
in one jump was at the car door his hair
and whiskers all bristled up like the back
of a tomcat ready for a fight

    hey you young devil what do you
think i am-a dog whistle for me will
when trouble gives the high-sign



you ive a good notion to kick that pie-
face of yourn clean into the back o your
neck the next time you do it i will
if you want your papers git em your-
self  

   i did but i resolved hed remember
the occasion he did

   we had hardly cleared the yards out

from me to have time for anything more
strenuous just then so i was extended a
cordial invitation to lend a hand from
the developments that resulted before i
got through mixing things up in that car
ill bet a stack that the old codger was
real glad that  didnt have morn one to
lend

of hamilton when the old boy leaves the
express-car and pokes his head into the
coach-door and passes the distress signal
to the conductor hed got all balled up
in stacking his car of  first-out and he
wanted the brakie to go up with him and
help sort out

   jimmie was too busily engaged in the
pleasant task of reading the death notices
and obituaries in a paper hed swiped

   of course im not on the carpet to
explain how all the tilings happened that
morning but it may have been due to a
little disinterested carelessness on my part
in arranging the bundles near the door for
the running deliveries for the different
towns that led to the sweet-tempered old
gents throwing the miamisburg papers at
carlisle and so on in several instances
hed never made a flying delivery before

my fingers had only closed on
the brake wheel when we
hit a sharp curve


the railroad mans magazine

and so when he let loose the first bundle
at carlisle he took the top clean off some
back-country agents buggy standing near
the track

   he wanted me to throw the bundles
for franklin which is across the river
from the c h and d station but as i
saw prospects of further similar stunts i
pleaded a lame shoulder we were by the
station before he let loose with the first
bundle of about seventy-five pounds

ignorance couples onto bliss

   he wasnt a good second to michael
sheridan on throwing but we were wheel-
ing along at a flat sixty if an inch and
the momentum carried that solidly tied
bundle of papers clean through the side
of a frame-house standing alongside the
track presenting the family a bigger batch
of reading matter than they had probably
ever had before collectively and that
bundle was originally intended for lima
at that

  at johnstons station he again gave
evidence of his extreme amateurishness in
making a flying delivery by sidewiping the
three posts that supported the high station
platform letting it down with a ripping
crash and some just-as-well-unheard re-
marks from the station-agent as he slid
ungracefully down and lit on a bundle of
papers labeled  piqua a town about forty
miles up the road

the messenger wakes up

   but that old goat went calmly on
enjoying the bliss of his ignorance of
errors being checked against him that
morning i was too inconsequential to
look at let alone hold converse with

   when we reached dayton our first
stop an irate official handed him a bunch
of telegrams that had been pouring in
from down the line and from the various
newspaper offices in cincinnati that dis-
pelled his ignorance-also his bliss also
i may add this was his last run on the
sunday paper-train

    i say butch do you believe much
in signs asked charlie matterson suc-
cessor to the old goat afore related of

    that depends mostly on the reading
on em say i-  now i took a run into
a place up in toledo one night last week

where there was a sign that read  hot
free lunch all day all you can eat
help yourself so i slacked ahead a bit
and coupled on and started in to follow
directions when a two-hundred-pound
bouncer got his knee in a rear-end col-
lision with my freight and put me in the
clear

    sincc then i have lost my abiding faith
in signs

     naw kid  say you got a loose brake-
shoe get it fixed what i mean is signs
portents omens forebodings and that
line of dope you know where something
that is going to happen is foretold by
something that you see or hear or that
occurs to you like a black cat following
you and meowing a tune like a funeral
march in  saul or anything like that-
do you see 

signs and counter-signs

    we were perched up on the four-story
stools of the depot lunch-counter taking
our coffee and-before going out to the
yards for the sunday paper run

     well said i thinking i could switch
him off his bad-luck argument  as an-
other instance theres a sign over there
that reads  best coffee in the city and
if some husky guy from up-state gets a
dose of this slop it will sure portend bad
luck to that sign

     oh say back up  youre too derned
facetious that dont answer my ques-
tion

     well then im not very supersti-
tious but why whats got on your
right of way overnight you were as
happy as a boy just out of school coming
in on the run last night now you look
as though if youd smile youd do some
bodily injury to your face

charlies numerous warnings

  just this kid id advise you to
report sick this morning and not go out
on this run somethings goin to tear
loose before we double back an i know
it for why well old jacksons dog
howled for two hours steady last night
i dreamed i was butchering an ox when
i got up i started to put on my left shoe
first my wife told me she dreamed she
saw me surrounded by a flock of sheep-
when trouble gives the high-sign



and sheep are always unlucky when you
see them in dreams

    i forgot my pipe and had to go back
and cross the threshold to get it a big
black tomcat followed me for three blocks
meowing like a steam calliope and when
i came in through the shed i passed one
of the cars theyve set out for the paper
run and theres a   first in its number

the trouble begins

    now kid you couldnt beat that
hand of ill-omen not even if you had the
whole deck to pick it from and he slid
down from his aerial tower carefully
wiped his mustache and gave me a look
which said  and you cant deny that 

   i was just going to pooh-pooh his
 sign  ideas when there was the rattling
clash of a patrol-wagon gong and we
could tell by the sound that they were
driving right into the yards back of the
main-track shed we were ready to
start anyway so we walked hurriedly out

through the station and shed to learn what
the trouble was

   first thing we came to was a pony-
yard engine standing on one of the main
line make-up tracks blowing off and no
one near her it was still quite dark and
charlie held up his lantern to have a look
at her

    great heavens kid look there
look at them drivers and side rods  and
look at them links under there its blood

   well they picked up what was left of
that poor devil in water-buckets he had
been crossing the yards in the dark and
got caught in the wheels of the pony

butch will see the fun

   we went silently back to the car to
wait for the papers to come down and
charlie sat on his box without a word
he had come to the road from the west
where he run in the days when an express
messenger had use for a gun and he didnt
know what it meant to be afraid of a man

took the top clean off some agents buggy


the railroad mans magazine

but i could see by the flare of the lantern
that his face was as pale as ashes

   finally he looked up  kid you keep
off tins run that thing out there is only
a curtain-raiser to whats goin to follow
in to-days play

    you going charlie  said i

  going sure

    then so am i

    but its different with me kid i
got to go like as not though ill come
back in some other fellows car-in a box

taking it out on them

   we had cleared hamilton when a
red flag pulled us down and we ran up to
a gang of section-men having trouble at a
road crossing where a traction-engine had
passed over with the hook end of a log-
chain dragging that had caught on a rail
edge and slewed the track old dan
swung down out of the cab and called em
all the things on his variegated list and
conductor thomas finished up as pictur-
esquely spectacular a line of tongue fire-
works as youd find

   i think that bunch of dagoes took
revenge by holding us there for an hour
and an hour behind the schedule for that
train meant a lot of trouble ahead

   dan climbed into the cab with the
remark that he was going to shove her
nose into dayton on time even if he had
to drag in some of the track and a part
of the road-bed with him and he came
mighty near doing both he just slipped
her up on the links as far as she would
stand and still cut her steam  and well
say when we saw a town in the dim dis-
tance we started to put -off papers but
they mostly landed a couple of miles be-
yond

old dan decides to speed

   dan was dragging her in all right
and first thing we knew we were crossing
the river into the lower yards at dayton
dan didnt ease her up much till we had
covered most of the yards and were in
sight of the union depot when at one and
the same time he cut her off and gave her
the air hard and tight

   but light as we were he couldnt
hold her and we jammed into an open
switch and smashed into a pony-engine on

a spur we had got there before the
sound of our whistle at the bridge had
reached them-so they said

charlie gets his

   i was on the rear platform to drop a
paper for a flagman i knew and had just
opened the coach-door to come in and i
came right on in without waiting to close
the door i bumped slightly against the
back of a seat and my watch broke from
its couplings and started on a trip up the
aisle i think it struck every seat on both
sides and finally landed against the far-
ther end of the car a dismembered and
tangled mess of debris

   the few passengers were mostly
hanging over the backs of the seats in
front and all hollerin for help but my
first thought was of charlie up ahead
with tons of papers piled in the rear of
the car when i opened the door i saw
i had guessed right the bundles had
shot ahead in promiscuous heaps and piles
and charlie nowhere in sight

   we finally pulled the poor cuss out
with a leg and four ribs broken while i
was holding his head on my knee until
the ambulance came he said to me  kid
i told you not to take the run out to-day
better lay over here and go back theres
more coming but i wanted to see the
rest of the show so i went on

the cat gets in again

   i heard months afterward when he
was at work again that he refused to take
out a run because a black cat chased by a
dog had jumped into his car while he was
loading at the platform

   jake lareau coupled on his  to the
 paper and we started on the run to
lima we were still behind the card but
jake had a reputation that left no doubt
as to what he would do with us and he
did it he jerked us tip the line so fast
we couldnt hold our breath long enough
to count the mile-posts

   just above tippecanoe city he swung
around a curve and sighted a farmers
spring-wagon crossing the line about a
mile ahead with the rear wheels in the
middle of the track but jake got there
just in time to tear the hind end clean
off that wagon and was blowing for the
tv

when trouble gives the high-sign



yard in troy before the farmer realized
what hit him

a calf takes to the air

   we left piqua and had rounded the
long curve into the straightaway when a
calf loomed up ahead caught fast in a
cattle guard i was holding onto the
overhead rail looking out the car-door
and just got a glimpse of it when jake
cut her open so quick he nearly broke the
couplings and the next i saw of that calf
it was doing a wright brothers flight
over into a neighboring wheat field

   i was just beginning to wonder if
there really was anything in the black-cat
sign and a bad start after all at lima
a yardman got his hand squeezed in hook-
ing on the new engine we were on time

but the run to toledo was a fast schedule
yet a grizzled old driver by the name of
steve was the man to cut it

   everything rolled smooth until after
we left ottawa jinnnie and i were
handling the papers in charlies place
and we were holding down the box re-
counting the mornings happenings when
steve begun to ride the whistle right after
she cleared the long curve

mutton goes up

  jumping to the door we saw a great
hock of sheep packed tight on the track in
a long string we were running down
grade and making over fifty miles per

   steve saw he was too close to brake
her dead before he could get through and
with all that wool bunching up and roll-

i told you not to
take the run out
to-day


the railroad mans magazine

  we were running
down grade making
over fifty miles per

ing under the drivers at slow speed meant
a derailed engine so he just yanked the
throttle clean back into the coal-bin
opened the sand give her the advantage
of a pulling notch or two on the bar and
ducked back of the boiler until the shower
of sheep subsided and i never saw a
sight like it in my life

 the meat trust has lately turned some

v

another for the run-back we had a regu-
lar passenger south and made a good run
as far as columbus grove where jimmie
remarked that our entertainment seemed

remarkable tricks in raising prices but
there have been mighty few occasions
when meat went up any faster or higher
than it did while stevewas plowing a fifty-
mile gait through that bunch of mutton
the sight that we got of it looked like a
snow-storm-going up

   when we pulled into deshler steves
machine looked like a hillock out west
after a bunch of cattlemen had made a
raid of slaughter on a sheep range they
were piled on the pilot on the running-
board and some on top of the boiler and
the odorous smell of scorched wool and
mutton drove lamb chops and such forever
from steves bill of fare

   at toledo they ran his engine over to
the house for a clean-up and gave him

to be over for the day and neither one
took the precaution to knock wood

   a big red cow had walked onto the
track from a clump of bushes right ahead
so close to the pilot that steve only had
time to open her up wide and dodge before
he struck that cow square in the middle
and a beef was never cut by any butcher
into so many pieces in so short a time

   that night we were nearing the cin-
cinnati terminal when just as we left the
bridge and swung into the yards the front
trucks of the rear coach climbed a switch
point and left the track and we had to
leave it for the wrecking-crew while we
run on in

   when a black cat crosses my right-
of-way nowadays i take another track
watch for willets

 ten thousand miles by rail  is the title of
his new series

first instalment next month

forget your dinner-pail but dont forget this

      mext month we begin the fourth series of gilson willetss
      stories of railroad men and railroad life we do not think
      we shall be accused of exaggeration when we say that the
      name of willets is a household word among railroad men

       not only the active readers of the railroad mans
       magazine are familiar with his cheerful countenance and
       sturdy figure but wherever two or three railroad men are gathered to-
       gether in those regions most of them have met willets and all of them
       have heard of him

           those who have mt him dont need any recommendation from us
       to read his stories there is a healthy vigor about the man an
       attractive good-fellowship a fascinating personality that will compel
       all who know him to follow all the stories by him that they can find

            they know that willets is a man-a man who can tell a mans story
        laugh at a mans jokes sympathize with a mans griefs they will read
        his stories

            to the men who have not met willets we would say that in this new
        series you have a chance to become acquainted with him in the way next
        best to shaking his hand he is at his best in this series

           he has the keenest sense of a story of any man we know he knows
       what to say and he knows what to leave unsaid and these two are the
       prime requirements of a good story-teller

             ten thousand miles by rail is a wonderful lot of new gripping
        human stories

next month in the pages of the railroad mans magazine

             she used to glow as shed swiftly go

             with the glimmering gloss of silk

            shes assistant now to the humble cow

            and hauls the morning milk

              no more she flings as the whistle sings

            her smoke far down the line

 she has gone the pace and run her race-

            old worn-out 

             theres a human side to her fallen pride
             for men are just the same

             for a day or a year they are heroes dear-
             and live in the hall of fame

but they fall behind in the constant grind
and others cross the line

once our pace is hot but were soon forgot
like poor old 
why wister was shot

            by katharine eggleston

a reward of money and the love of a beau-
tiful girl hang tremblingly in the balance

 id

am wister the texas ranger
peered out from under his
snow-covered hat brim at the
whirling maelstrom of smoth-
ering whiteness that appeared
to be scooped up from the
prairie to join the feathery bur-
den of the air and to twist into freezing
spirals that tried to squeeze the last faint
spark of life from his saddle-tired wind-
lashed body

  he glared at the moving whirlwind
of snow he felt as if its terrific breath
must suck away his own then he lift-
ed his heavy hand and clutched at the
packet of papers in his pocket some-
how a new strength that had the effect
of warmth flowed through him it was as
if the papers possessed some mighty gal-
vanic power

  they contained the death-warrant of
a fellow man

  but to sam they meant something
more and different he was struggling
now through the blizzard to a house
about five miles from fort worth where
lily menden lived and-so sam hoped
-loved him

  a big reward had been offered by
relatives in england for the capture of
the man who had killed a young eng-
lishman who had been prospecting in
mexico and texas

  the murder had occurred at san an-
tonio but pete marsh had sent word to
sam that he would deliver the man who

had committed it into his hands at three
oclock of the night which would follow
the storm-mad day but the delivery
must be at fort worth

  sam had started on his long ride in
threatening weather early in the week
then came the blizzard which had driv-
en every live thing to cover or to death
besides himself he had pushed on
buoyed up by the promise of the big re-
ward and the hope it gave him of win-
ning lily menden

  he knew he must be within a few
miles of her now but the wild swirl
of the wind caught and caressed the
suffocating masses of snow into long
arms that rose and reached for him till
he was utterly confused

  fie was on the verge of delirium the
snow-madness was beginning to fire his
brain with its white-hot visions of fan-
tastic disproportions at one moment
the dully gleaming arms that reached
for him were alive the next he knew
them to lie but writhing snow-currents
but he knew too that a time was soon
coming when he should not recognize
them for what they were when he would
fling himself from his stumbling horse
and welcome their embrace

  suddenly the dying beat of his heart
quickened with an excruciating pain

  a demoniac rage seized him at the
racking interruption of the comfortable
numbness of mind and body that had
taken possession of him




the railroad mans magazine

  he writhed in his saddle and stared
revengefully into the white waste about
him after a long interval as it seemed
to him an explaining report came

  he was shot

  his horse stopped and stood trem-
bling then out in front so vague that
neither man nor beast could be sure that
the appearance was more than some ec-
centric evolution of the snow a figure
showed for an instant

  waster gave a hoarse cry his horse
moved on even following a shadow
was better than meekly lying down to
add another to the slowly piling mounds
the storm was building

  wister felt a twinge in his hip he
put his hand on the spot there was
a vfarm dampness he turned suddenly
sick and fell forward

  the reins which were twisted about
the saddle-horn caught him in their loop
the horse paused as the unaccountable
weight dragged heavily to one side he
waited for his rider to adjust himself
then when wister did not move the
animal began again its patient plodding
through the snow

  the fagged creature took heart there
too recent to be obliterated dragging
deeply through the snow was the track
of another of its kind if wister had
been able to notice anything he would
have known that the shadow out in front
was more than a fantasy of the storm

  mrs menden rose tremblingly and
started toward the door when she heard
the sound

  a man entered a mexican to judge
from his speech and complexion

   senora it was useless i could not
get on to fort wort

  fie glanced quickly about the room
as if to see if it had other occupants than
the old lady and himself

   it is all right he continued as if
to answer the frightened questioning in
the worn weak face  i have shot him
with much care in the hip

  mrs menden gasped and tottered to
her chair by the fireplace

   he may get lost  she said seeming
to vibrate between relief and fear

  no no the man assured her his
tones at once deferential and soothing
 i rode ahead i watched till his horse
had found my trail it is slow going

the horse is spent if he does not come
i will go for him do not be anxious
senora it is better-

  the door from the kitchen swung
open and lily menden came into the
room

   sen or it a you see you were right
i mus seek your hospitality yet the
mexican exclaimed with an ease and
grace that savored of contact with a
social world different from border tex-
as or even the one to which most of the
mexicans who came farther north were
used

  lie had scarcely finished speaking
when lilys erect head bent in intent
listening

  what is it mrs menden asked
nervously

  the mexican shot a warning glance
toward her

   you will have other guests he ob-
served quietly

  lily was scraping the rime from the
window

   its a horse a riderless horse  she
exclaimed

  mrs menden seemed to shrivel with
terror as she grasped the meaning of the
words

  the mexican started perceptibly
then he dashed to the door and went out
into the storm a moment later he en-
tered dragging the inert form of a man

  lily had been unable through the cur-
tain of snow to see the figure that hung
motionless on the off side of the horse

  she lent her splendid strength to carry
the victim of the storm to a chair

  its sam she cried seeing the
bloodless face of the ranger

  her quick hands felt over his heart
tt was beating she sent the mexican
for restoratives

  then she saw the great stain of
blood on his clothing

  hes hurt hes wounded she
cried wildly

  the composure of the man who stood
beside her did not change

  mrs menden whose power to feel
seemed to have merged into an apathy
took little account of her daughters ex-
clamation

   wounded sefiorita let me examine
i am somewhat skilled

  lily felt herself pushed gently aside
why wister was shot



as the mexican bent to cut away the
blood-soaked cloth and look at the
wound

  it was a flesh-wound the very kind
that a duelist might give when he wished
merely to incapacitate his opponent

   not bat at all senorita water and
bandages and i will make it right

  he spoke somewhat loudly as if he
wished the half-fainting old woman to
get the meaning of his words

  lily went quickly from the room to
get the dressings

  the mexicans hand slid to sams
pocket

   i will take the papers to make
double-sure he said

  the ranger stirred and opened his
eyes

  the mexicans hand slipped down to
the wound as if that were his only in-
terest

  it does not matter he said to mrs
menden  he cannot get on to the
fort-and i will go in the morning

   i must go  sam said thickly try-
ing to rise

  but his tired body weak from bleed-
ing and exposure failed him he sank
heavily back as lily came into the room

   sam 

  she ran to him her eager arms
closed about him

  sam knew that the question he had
meant to ask was answered

   lily he whispered strengthened
by his joy  im going to get the man
that killed that englishman at san an-
tone to-night at three in fort worth
theres a big reward we can get
married 

  the mexican apparently only casual-
ly interested in sams words was stand-
ing by mrs mendens chair but when
she seemed about to cry out his lingers
pressed her shoulder reminded her of
the need for silence and control

   you cant go to the fort sam 
lily cried  some coward shot you
and-

   ive got to go i tell you  sam
persisted almost roughly  ive got to
get the sheriff and catch that man  

  the mexican spoke his hand rested
heavily on mrs mendens shoulder

   then it is known who killed the
englishman he asked

   no not exactly but pete marsh
has got him and hell turn him over to
me at three thats why ive got to get
there hes hard to catch some one
seems to keep him informed and he slips
right out from under our fingers

  sam was breathing laboredly as he
finished his head sank against lilys
breast

    sefiorita he is too weak   the mexi-
can exclaimed lifting sam to the lounge
 i will dress the wound then-i will
take the paper and ride to the fort so
you can be married you see 

  me was busy making sam comfortable
the eagerness with which his hands
sought the papers struck lily peculiarly

  she had grown up on the prairies
broad-minded and generous but keen
with the intuition that develops among
people who must make quick deductions
that lead to prompt action not know-
ing why but instantly she was in pos-
session of the papers

   when he is better we will ask him
what to do she said quietly

  the mexican went on dressing sams
wound with such an air of complete ab-
sorption in his task that lily was half
inclined to discredit her intuition but
she kept the papers

   i think the man who killed the eng-
lishman will not be caught-to-night
the mexican remarked as he looked from
sam sunk in deep sleep out into the
raging storm

  he took his candle and climbed up
to the bedroom in the half-story above
lily helped her mother to bed noticing
with alarm the added signs of age and
weakness that each day seemed to bring

   berts all right mother she said
consolingly hell turn up before long
dont worry about him

  but the mother would not be com-
forted

  lily returned to her place beside sam
she waited for him to wake filling the
time with pictures of the future that
stretched promisingly before her -
then the full meaning of the reward
began to dawn on her sam had loved
her a long time she knew this with a
womans inner vision but it was only
when he had a definitely good prospect
that he had told her if he lost this re-
ward it would mean at the best a long


the railroad mans magazine

wait and young loving eager to be his
wife she contemplated the prospect with
dread

  she looked long and critically into
sams face deep lines of fatigue the
deadly pallor caused by the bleeding his
uneven breathing told her that he could
not hope to get to the fort

  it was nine oclock the papers must
be there before three she might call
the mexican but even without the sus-
picion that would persist in her mind
she knew he stood little chance of arri-
ving at the fort he was too heavy for
her pony the only horse on the ranch
that was so familiar with the route that
he could keep his way in spite of the
storm

  there was just one way to get the
papers there in time	-

  she must go

  but her mother for weeks she had
seemed to be in a state bordering on
collapse no word came to her from her
boy and with the natural instinct of
such natures she had grown more and
more dependent on her daughter lily
wondered if she dared risk the ride on
her account

  she looked at the man she loved a
great assurance came to her that her
effort to serve him must meet with suc-
cess she kissed him softly and blushed
as if he were conscious of the caress

  she saddled her pony and rode off in-
to the storm

  at one oclock she delivered the pa-
pers to the sheriff at fort worth and
explained sams condition

  no urging would detain her at five
her brave little mustang was back in the
shed and she was shaking the snow from
her clothes before the fireplace at home

   oh sam  she whispered kneeling
beside him  its all right 

  she leaned her head against his shoul-
der and morning found her there-
her body relaxed and resting after its
long trial

  the mexican was looking down at
her with a strange look in his brown eyes
when she suddenly awakened

   senorita you love him he said
gently  i have known another woman
to love-so she die 

  lily nodded she could understand
that

  sam moved and groaned then he
awakened his eyes rested on lily as
if she suggested it he lifted his hand
to feel for his papers

  lily have you my papers he
cried as he discovered their loss

  mrs menden was just coming into the
room she paused at sams question
and the mexican turned quickly from
gazing into the fire

   theyre at fort worth sam the
sheriff has them i took them by
flow the man is caught  lily an-
swered with happy pride thrilling in her
voice

  suddenly her mother darted forward
as if to strike her

  you have killed your brother she
shrieked falling to the floor

  what does she mean lily asked
hoarsely of sam

  but sam could only look from mother
to daughter in complete confusion

   my boy my baby  the stricken
mother sobbed

   was bert the- lily began then
the whole terrible truth seemed to come
to her and with it a poignant realization
of what her night ride meant

  the mexican watched the growing
terror and the agony that looked from
her wide eves then turned away

   my god i have killed bert  she
whispered through stiffening lips

  then sams part in the affair darted
through her mind to add a new misery

  sam you-you were going to cap-
ture my brother to get the reward-

  but sam interrupted her with convinc-
ing earnestness

   i didnt know none of us down
there knew pete marsh just promised
to give us the man he didnt mention
a name

  then perhaps bert didnt do it
lily cried

   lit was a young fellow nobody
knew him down there he just dropped
into a card-room won a lot from the
englishman and they got into a fight
about three hours after they found the
englishman dead in the street they
thought the boy doneit some one knew
where he bunked and as they were all
spoilin for some excitement they got a
rope and went after him but some one
got to him first he had lit out and
why wister was shot

hes been getting away ever since i hope
if its bert hell get out of the country 

  lilys cry of despair made the mexi-
can start and clench his hands till the
knuckles showed whitely in contrast to
the brown skin

   get out of the country the sheriff
has him now i-iell be hung

  the door burst open as some one hurled
himself against it in the blinding
sweep of snow they all turned to see a
mans figure dimly discernible

  the mexican slammed the door shut
mrs menden lifted her head and stared
at the visitor for an instant

   bertie bertie  she cried her weak
voice breaking with the weight of joy it
expressed

   mother 

  the boy lifted the little figure and
hugged her as if nothing could ever tear
his arms away

  bert is it you lily whispered
lifted so suddenly from the depths of
grief that she could not believe in the
joy

   im here at last thank god   the
boy cried fervently  i suspected old
pete hes fond of money and-

  the color that had come into lilys
face left it

  bert be still sams here she
cautioned

  the boy lifted his head from his
mothers shoulder stared for a second at
the ranger then glanced at the door a
hunted look came into his eyes he
crouched as if he meant to make a dash
for freedom

  he straightened up and faced sam
bravely

   i didnt do it sam but i cant
prove it i dont know any more about
that englishman than you do except i
know i never saw him after we had that
fight i didnt even know lie was dead
till some one told me they were coming to
hang me for killing him

   i had to light out they wouldnt
wait to hear me they wouldnt have
believed i guess just like pete wouldnt
he kept asking to see the pearl ring i
killed the englishman for when they
get the man that did it hell have that
ring i havent 

the boys words rang true sam rec-
ognized the duty that confronted him he

must arrest him and take him to san
antonio

  you believe him dont you sam
lily asked as his silence continued

    yes i believe him he said slowly
 but im not the judge

  you-you dont mean that youre go-
ing to take him down there down
among the san antone bad men they
wouldnt wait to find out before they
wont now theyd hang him first-and
find out hes innocent after 

  sam knew that doing his duty meant
one thing he would lose the girl he
loved and not doing it meant expulsion
from the rangers and being branded as
irresponsible and cowardly

   he was silent as the two alternatives
presented themselves to him

   bert eyed him narrowly then appreci-
ating the position in which the ranger
was placed he said firmly

   all right sam i see how youre
fixed ill go with you-and take what
comes

  sam dont take him i cant bear
it 

  mrs menden sank at sams feet it
seemed to him he heard the mother-heart
break as she spoke

   itll kill her lily sobbed lifting
the fainting woman

  what can we do bert asked his
boyish face pale and his eyes wide with
fear that showed he had forgotten his
own extremity in the misery of his moth-
er and sister

   in the accumulating strain of the mo-
ment no one noticed the mexican he
had stood perfectly still only his open-
ing and clenching his hands held behind
him betrayed his share in the excite-
ment -mrs menden moaned as if in
physical torture

   his lips drew into straight thin lines
as if he forcefully suppressed a desire
to speak

  lily turned her pleading agonized
face toward sam

  the mexican caught the look he
shrugged his shoulders slightly and said

  scnor ranger you will take me to
san antone i killed the englishman

  they all looked at him bert studied
his face as if it-were vaguely familiar

   why youre the man who warned
me  he exclaimed


the railroad mans magazine

   yes i warned you i had no thought
that what  did would be fastened on
you i felt i must keep you from suf-
fering for my deed it is to warn you
again that i came from san antone they
wait there for the murderer old pete
sold you out i came to help you escape
but the blizzard caught me

   i am but a small way in advance of
the ranger i come here and tell your
mother to take care for you and i shot
the ranger to make sure the word would
not reach fort wort that you are there
before i can get to warn you but your
sister is brave she take the paper so
i must tell

  they were staring at the calm man al-
most unbelievingly it seemed impos-
sible to associate him with the crime he
confessed

   why did you kill the englishman
sam asked

  the mexican spoke to the ranger with
great formality

   seiior i have in my coat something
that will tell you i will get it

 he crossed the room opened the stair-
 way-door and disappeared

 time passed rapidly as they all ques-
 tioned bert then it occurred to sam
 that his prisoner was a long time gone

  he must be making whatever hes
 going to show me sam said

 bert opened the stairway-door a
 small packet dropped from its place on
 the latch

 bert handed it to the ranger

 fie opened it a ring fell from the
 paper

 its a pearl ring bert cried

  its a womans ring  lily ex-
 claimed

  he killed the englishman-on her
 account sam said

 then he tried to rise

 id like to know where he is he
 went on sinking back helplessly

 but he never did

 the mexican was gone and the re-
 ward

 but the ranger married lily before his
 wound was healed

 for the mail-glerks safety

the missouri pacific-iron mountain system puts on heavy steel cars

of a new pattern

moved by the appeals of the railway
mail-clerks who assert that they are
the most likely to injury on a wrecked train
because the last to demand and receive ade-
quate protection- the missouri pacific-iron
mountain system has put all-steel mail-cars
on its fast passenger trains between st
louis and kansas city and st louis and
little rock and texas statistics show that
one of every eighteen persons killed or in-
jured in railroad wrecks in the united states
last year was a mail-clerk

  the cars are entirely new of a type de-
signed by general manager a w sulli-
van of the missouri pacific and are said to
be the first of their kind inuse west of the
mississippi river

  these new cars were built by the ameri-
can car and foundry company at its st
charles plant they are sixty feet long in-
side the under frame is made of heavy
 i  beams and channel irons with trans-
verse steel-plate diaphragms to which is riv-
eted a steel floor

  on the top of the steel floor is laid a

heavy course of asbestos material for insu-
lation and this in turn is covered with a
standard wood floor for the comfort of the
mail-clerks

  the steel side walls are faced with a hair-
felt and asbestos insulating material which
together with the dead-air spaces between
the outer and the inside walls throughout
the sides and roof of the car affords ample
means for the prevention of radiation

  the car is heated by means of six sets of
steam-pipe coils which are fed with steam
from the locomotive the ends of the car
are built up with heavy channel irons and
 i  beams covered with steel plates pro-
ducing a most excellent type of anti-tele-
scoping construction

  their strength surpasses that of all steel
cars heretofore built it is anticipated that
this style of mail-car will be a source of
safety to the remainder of the train in
case of derailments or accidents wooden
mail-cars are generally the first to catch fire
in a wreck thus destroying the rest of the
train

   what i say about valve-settin goes
pete replied panhandle dan  and
even atthat the  has never had her
valves set right since ive had her

pretty husky valves

   say do you know what you did to
them valves the last time you monkeyed
with them pete ill tell you what you
did you gave her so much lead that the
valves were about three revolutions ahead
of the piston all the time and a heap
more than that goin down-hill

 i certainly did have a fierce time get-

tin over the road at all with the old
mill goin down the oakland hill
with the limited my air-pump gave
out the air all  leaked out and i
couldnt hold em i had to let em
roll by the time we got to the
bottom of that four-mile toboggan-
slide them valves had increased her
lead so much that it would have
taken two men to see us go by one
to say  here she comes  and the
other to say  there she goes 

 just to give you an idea how
fast we were goin i whistled for
the station as usual we ran by
about six train
lengths on ac-
count of havin
to make a hand-
stop backed up
made the station-
stop fixed the air-
pump and pulled
out and had got
as far as the wa-
ter-tank before
the sound of the
w h i s  e got to
oakland

   that reminds
me of old bill
gallaghers ride down cimarron hill
said blue-nosed barry the last sum-
mer old bill was on the denver and rio
grande he was pullin old pop hicken-
looper on a work-train there was a
pair of cranks for you each one was
so darned cranky you couldnt live in the
same state with him

old bill  and old pop

   old bills fireman used to duck his
head every time he stooped over to put
in a fire from force of habit he was so
used to havin old bill kick at him
and whenever the brakemen wanted to
know anything about their work they
used to drop old pop hickenlooper a
postal-card

   old bill was perfectly dotty about
his engine he was eternally fussing
about the old mill he couldnt run her
half a mile without stoppin to oil round
he would steal oil for her from the other
engines besides using about three times
as much as any other man used that he
around the

order-book



got on requisition he wouldnt crowd
her over eight miles an horn for fear of
heating her brasses and he simply
wouldnt pull a full train

   him and the fireman had a regular
kilkenny-cat fight one day because old
bill insisted on the fireman gettin down
and pushin to help the old mill over a
little rise when he was out on the road
with the work-train that man actually-
used to go out every night just before lie
turned in and sing  rock-a-by baby in
the tree-top  to his old mill

   pop hickenloopers principal bug
was a feather bed that he carried in the
caboose he slept nineteen hours of the
twenty-four and left the brakemen to run
the train so you see he was in
a position to appreciate a soft
bed-which he did

   them two old cranks
strange to say were cronies it
must have been because cussed-
ness like misery likes com-
pany old bill would babble
about his engine and pop
hickenlooper would drool
about his feather-bed neither
payin the slightest attention to
what the other was sayin and
so they got along fine they
certainly did flock together a
whole lot up to the time they
came down the cimarron hill

   any of you fellers that
have been over the denver and
rio grande knows that coinin
down the cimarron canon is
like failin down a well pop
hickenlooper was at the sum-
mit one day when he got a
 can have  to gunnison the
orders didnt allow
any time for pickin
flowers so they start-
ed right down the
canon with old bill
grumblin as usrual
because his darling
old mill would have
to turn her wheels so
fast

   he had a string
of a dozen empty j-norman
flats with a hundred
italian shovelers for
passengers old bill

worked steam a little till hed got em a
rollin nicely then he shut oft stretched
himself out on the seat-box and prepared
for a comfortable ride expectin of
course that the brakemen would do the
rest

   this was in the good old days of the
armstrong brake you see he didnt
take much notice until he saw a juniper-
bush on the rocks close beside the track
bend violently over in the direction he
was goin as no bush ever does except in
a violent wind then he yelped for
brakes

   did anybody ever see a flat-car any-
where that ever had a brake in good or-
der i never did the only response to

grabbed pops own particular

 feather-bed in both arms


the railroad mans magazine

bills call for brakes was an extra spurt
as them ornery flats dropped down over
a little pitch old bill let out another
yelp and looked back to see why it wasnt
responded to

   he saw the two brakemen on the
caboose platform both swingin on the
caboose brake the only one on the whole
train that would hold two ounces with
pop hickenlooper standin in the door
watchin em with his eyes stickin out
till you could have used em for hat-pegs

   by this time they were goin so fast
that the wind picked up one of the light-
weight italians and slammed him back
against the two brakemen biff they
all fell off old bill kept yelpin for
brakes and givin her sand while the fire-
man made the greatest effort of his life
with the tank-brake another italian
was picked up by the wind and carried
off followed by another and another un-
til the train was depopulated

   by this time the train was moving so
swift that it cracked like the snapper on
a whip every time it went around a re-
verse curve the wheels were spinning
so fast that the humming they made was
keyed up to a pitch as shrill as the song
of a mosquito in their wake was an
odor of scorching wood caused by the
friction on them old flats

   they probably would have busted
out into a blaze if it hadnt been for the
creek the road followed every bend of
the creek within three feet of the water
just like all mountain roads do that
train was goin so fast that the suction
just picked all the water up bodily and
eddied it around over them fiats keepin
em thoroughly drenched and so prevent-
in a fire

violating rule 

   about this time the fireman gave up
his endeavors with the tank-brake lit a
cigarette fished up his time-card out of
his seat-box read the reverse side till he
found rule  he put his thumb under
the place and held it so bill could read

    work-trains must not exceed fifteen
miles an hour

   that made old bill so mad he
couldnt speak he sputtered but only
got purple ill the face i guess the blood
must have rushed to his head so hard on

account of the passion he was in that the
extra weight kind o threw the machine
off her balance anyway when she
struck the next curve she trembled a bit
then hopped down off the rails and went
bumpety-bump along on the ties

   old bill was frantic he had a
photograph in his minds eye of his pet
toppling over on the cruel rocks and get-
tin all mussed up he jumped down on
the deck clenched his hands and yelled

a bed to fall on

   then he gave the most marvelous ex-
hibition of presence of mind that has been
witnessed since railroads were invented

   quicker than a cat he whirled went
up over the coal in the tank on all fours
sprinted back over them flats bowled
over pop hickenlooper who was stih-
standin in the door with his eyes bulgin
at the scenery tore madly into the ca-
boose grabbed pops own particular
feather-bed in both arms bulged through
the door with it and sprinted ahead to
where he thought the engine was due to
topple over

   there he kicked away the rocks
spread that feather - bed down and
smoothed it off nicely he had barely
time to get things ready when up comes
his pet bumpin over the ties balances
on two wheels a minute and then lays
gently down on that feather-bed like a
chicken goin to roost

   everything would have been lovely if
one of the keys in her side rod hadnt
caught in the bed-tick and tore it so that
about a handful of feathers oozed out
old bill was willing to apologize to pop
hickenlooper about them feathers and
do what he could to square things until
he found that a pin pop had used to
fasten piller-shams to the bed-tick and
had carelessly left stickin in the tick had
scratched the side of the cab

  he never forgave pop for his reck-
lessness about that pin and pop on his
part carried murder in his heart toward
old bill on account of the shameful way
he had used his feather-bed

   now then if you gentsll kindly
disperse a little said panhandle dan
briskly  id like to take my pen in hand
and indite a few choice thoughts in that
there order-book
 dad allen lets em roll

by e e jennings

         force of habit made him forget his old
         teapot didnt carry anything but hand-brakes

he usual crowd had gathered
in the c and st j round-
house at craigville i
should say the usual  jol-
ly  crowd for pay-day
had come round once more
and one and all from wiper to passen-
ger engineer were killing time in various
ways while waiting the arrival of the
band-wagon

  several yarns had been spun and a
few arguments had taken place when
dad allen veteran engineer of the line
suddenly leaned forward in his chair and
knocked the ashes out of his pipe on the
heel of his boot this was always a sure
sign that dad was about due to open up
and invariably caused the same condition
of silence and attention that are seen in
court when the judge raps for order  for
dad was a rare entertainer no engineer
on the system had more close calls

  the old man reached in his pocket
produced his knife and tobacco started
to fill up his corn-cob again and then
began

   listening to you boys kick because
all freight-cars aint equipped with air-
brakes yet reminds me of a little mix-up
i once had on the kilmorna hill it
wasnt because the cars werent all
equipped for air but ill tell you about
it just to show you what force of habit
will do for a man at times

   it was in the fall of  that this
happened and it was in the spring of
 that i got my job back after va-
rious officials had failed to discover the
real reason why the  chicago bullet 
ran away on the kilmorna hill

   all the better class of engines car-
ried westinghouse those days but we had
a few little dinkies that did yard-work
and local business that the company did
not think it worth while fitting up when
i came down to the roundhouse at mel-
ton that morning and found out that my
engine the  had been taken to dou-
ble-head the snow-plow i expressed my
opinion of the locomotive foreman and
other officials in no uncertain language

   some of the boys say there are blue
streaks on the window-glass yet down in
the melton roundhouse where my breath
frosted the pane but that must have oc-
curred when i found out that i had to
take the    out on the  bullet

  i knew the  and so did every
man on the division a little teapot that
was pulled off the main line on account
of poor steaming qualities and i could
see my finish trying to make time with
a mill like that on the head-end of a beef-
train but there was nothing else in the
roundhouse and the superintendents or-
ders read start  out on time with
engine 

   well we got the yard-engine to give


the railroad mans magazine

us a shove out of melton ward and man-
aged to get away on the dot and i was
beginning to hope that we would get a
clear run over the division when as we
were nearing lyndon i saw the order-
board out against me i said a few
tilings that wouldnt look well in print
as  whistled for brakes but i said more
when we pulled up and got orders to
meet extra  at sherwood that little
flag-station at the foot of the kilmorna
hill

   i had figured on letting her go her
own pace on that grade but i knew that
i could never let her out with twenty-
two cars of dressed beef behind her and
stop at sherwood however when we hit
the top of the hill i thought that i would
let her go for half a mile and then give
her the air which would be safe enough
as i had done it dozens of times with the
 and right here is where force of
habit caused me to make the biggest bull
i ever made on an engine

   when i thought it was about time to
slow up i reached for the handle of the
air-controller only to discover that i had
forgotten that there was no air on this
engine there we were splitting the
wind at about fifty per with nothing but
hand-brakes behind us and two green
brakemen in the caboose

   i whistled brakes threw her over
and gave her the sand but it didnt do
much good i looked back over the train
and could see one man crawling over the
running-board of the car ahead of the
dog-house on his hands and knees just
about ready to grab anything with his

the small

tiny tim is the name of the smallest
engine in the world it is made of
gold and steel and is so small that a com-
mon housefly seems large in comparison
it weighs just four grains complete which
is the weight of an ordinary match it
takes over ioo such engines to weigh one
ounce almost  to weigh a pound and
more than  to weigh a ton

  the engine-bed and stand are of gold
the shaft runs in hardened and ground steel
bearings inserted in the gold bed these
bearings are counter-bored from the inside
to form a self-oiling bearing the fly-wheel
has a steel center and arms with a gold rim

 teeth that might help him to hold on
 while the other jasper seemed to be
 afraid the cupola might blow off the ca-
 boose for he was sure holding it on tight

     thinks i to myself were in a deuce
  of a fix if stewart isnt in the clear at
  sherwood for by this time even air
  wouldnt have held us up when we
  rounded the curve near the west sema-
  phore i could see stewart pulling in the
  siding at the east end switch and i knew
  for certain that he wouldnt get in clear
  in time

      whistled as long as i dared stay
 with her and then i yelled to my fire-
 man  come on son  and we both lit
 out for the deep snow which thanks be
 was plentiful

    the  side-wiped the fifth car ahead
  of stewarts caboose but by good luck
  they had heard us whistling and had time
  to hike out of the caboose and over the
  fence clear of the pile-up

     tt took the auxiliary three days to
  clear up the mess but it took the officials
  over three months trying to clear up the
  cause which they didnt or i wouldnt
  be here with you fellows now they put it
  down at last to bad rail small engine and
  heavy train but it cost me three months
  pay to convince them to this effect and
  get reinstated  but boys to this day i
  cant see how in creation i came to for-
  get that i wasnt carrying air right after
  stopping at lyndon with hand-brakes

     it just goes to show what force of-
  say boys theres the band-wagon pull-
  ing in on track  come on and get in
  ahead of murphy and the bridge-gang

est engine

  and the complete wheel weighs one grain
  the cylinder is of steel with octagonal base
  highly polished

    the stroke is - of an inch bore -
  of an inch seventeen pieces are used in
  the construction of this engine

    the speed of the engine is  revolu-
  tions per minute when running  per

  it makes a noise like the noise of a mos-
  quito the horse-power is - of one

  be borne  the eyeball without winking

                synopsis of previous chapters

fred erskine waits upon the general manager of the chicago st louis and west-
ern railroad andrew warrington with a letter of introdiction from his father
who in the old days was engineer on the engine warrington fired it is understood that
when fred has completed his college and altoona course warrington will place him he
now finds that he is unable to do so his own position being in considerable doubt bonds
of the value of half a million dollars have been stolen and suspicion points toward war-
ringtons son though the matter is still kept quiet warrington senior is suspicious of
the motives of an englishman named montresor who has gained the friendship of joe
warrington and apparently of louise warringtons daughter the old man gives the
task of solving the disappearance of the bonds and of returning them secretly to the safe
to erskine he is to work absolutely in the dark receiving no recognition from warring-
ton using any means he wishes he is to take louise to the opera that night but louise
suspecting him has the coachman drive to lincoln park and there fred is assaulted by a
man whom he believes to be montresor erskine is walking  the lake shore thinking
over the situation when he meets a man who proves to be the discharged coachman of
the warringtons he is very loyal to miss warrington and this has resulted in his dis-
charge erskine succeeds in convincing him that he is miss warringtons friend and the
coachman agrees to work with him other men arrive and erskine gathers that it is their
intention to keep a rendezvous with young warrington and then kill him he meets the
young fellow who agrees to confide in him but as erskine leads the way from the shore
he is startled by a piercing shriek

chapter ix

an untold story

or only a moment did fred
erskine hesitate the
shriek that had rung in his
ears scarcely had died away
when the altoona man set
off at full speed in the di-
rection of the sea-wall he had left behind
him less than a minute before

  arriving at the wall he leaned over
and listened from a point on the beach
several paces to his right came the
sounds of sharply spoken words which
were too quietly uttered to be intelligible
to him these were followed by a
shuffling of feet a splashing of water
began in the march railroad mans



and the quick regular clicking of metal
oar-locks

   mcgrane   erskine called

  to this call there was no reply then
erskine cried the coachmans name
again this time therf came to his ears
a low groan closely followed by a stur-
dily muttered curse

  is that you mcgrane demanded
erskine as he prepared to vault over the
wall

  yes - yes in gods name come
quick

  a moment later erskine was  the
beach the sounds of the oar-locks were
growing fainter and as the young man
listened these were the only sounds he
heard

  where are you barney he called

magazine single copies  cents


the railroad mans magazine

after he had vainly attempted to make
out the figure of the coachman in the
darkness

   here sir-here came the voice of
mcgrane and as the coachman spoke
erskine heard the sound of shifting
stones

  what has happened barney de-
manded erskine anxiously

   oh the sneakin murderin devils 
exclaimed the coachman breathlessly
just as i was finishin off the black-
guard with the knife another knocked
me-barney mcgrane-off my pins for
the first time in my life oh when i
get my hands on-oh -sir when-but
mr joseph-whats become of mr
joseph 

  erskine raised his voice  warring-
ton   he called

   in heavens name whats this

  in the darkness the coachman had
stumbled upon the figure of a man who
was lying on the beach

    by all thats holy sir its-its mr
joseph exclaimed mcgrane

  a moment later erskine and the
coachman were kneeling beside the pros-
trate form of young warrington as
erskine groped for the wrist of the
stricken man joe warringtons fingers
closed feebly over his hand the fingers
seemed strangely stiff and chill and er-
skine shuddered

  are you injured mr warrington
erskine asked anxiously

   yes-yes-theyve finished me the
other answered weakly

  erskine started to rise  come mc-
grane lets get him over to the heuse
he said

  the grasp of the prostrate man grew
tighter  no-no-dont go he mur-
mured  theyve knifed me and im
done there is no time to take me any-
where and-

  who assaulted you erskine asked
it was one of montresors crowd i
know but-

   it was too dark to see joe war-
rington replied  but there is no time
now to talk of that you have said that
you are working in my fathers interest
and mine and i believe what you have
said to me you know montresor had the
bonds and you say that he-has he lost
them 

   no he has sent them somewhere
by express-to tacoma i believe i
must get after them to-night they are
said to be in some kind of a machine-
box do you know what is meant by
that

   may god forgive me-yes mut-
tered the dying man  it is a box which
contained an aiixell typewriting machine
-a wooden box marked with the name
of the manufacturer-a box which stood
for several days in the office of the treas-
urer of the company it contained the
missing bonds at the time they were de-
livered to montresor

   do you know to whom the box is
addressed at tacoma 

   i did not know that it was to be
delivered to any one in tacoma

  there was a pause then erskine
asked  and is this all you have to tell
me

  joe coughed weakly and a little groan
escaped his lips

  erskine leaned lower

   what are the names of his confed-
erates he queried

   by stealth-by stealth you said
the dying man whispered and the fin-
gers that held erskines hand tightened
their grasp if you do this-louise-
louise-

  he stopped  yes yes but- er-
skine began

  a faint choking sound came from
joes throat

  if you do this- he repeated but
could get no further

  shall i get miss warrington
asked mcgrane

   she is not at home erskine remind-
ed him  but perhaps-

  stop whispered young warring-
ton  i must tell-you must remem-
ber-twenty-six eighty-nine-fifth pro-
verbs- twenty-two-twenty-three-nine-
teen thousand and forty-seven

  for a moment erskine fancied that
the whispering man was speaking inco-
herently then a new thought struck him
and starting violently he said

  again 

  deliberately but more faintly than be-
fore joseph warrington whispered
 twenty-six eighty-nine-last two of
the fifth-nineteen thousand and forty-
seven
without lights



   slowly and distinctly erskine repeated
the words

   yes-yes-remember sighed the
stricken man

  perspiration now was standing in
beads on frskines forehead as he asked 
but your-montresors confederate
tell me  

  he paused for an answer but war-
rington was silent  your sister is
not- erskine began but stopped

   ah louise-poor louise 

   you do not mean that your sister-
warrington tightened his grip on
erskines hand

   she must not know the dying man
murmured hoarsely  you have said
that by stealth-by stealth-my honor
and my fathers-

  he stiffened suddenly and the hand
that was holding erskines relaxed its
grasp and fell to the stony beach on
which he lay

  shall i get a doctor sir barney
asked

    its too late now erskine answered
like a man in a dream

   he isnt dead   exclaimed mc-
grane in horrified accents

    hes dead said erskine rising

  then sir we must take him to the
house

   no the body must lie here until
it is viewed by the coroner

   but his father-we must tell mr
warrington what has happened

   no the body will be identified
easily enough and his father will be in-
formed it is best that we do nothing
further in regard to this matter to-
night

  an exclamation of amazement es-
caped the coachmans lips

   and youd let him-him as was mr
andrew warringtons son-lie for hours
like a dead dog out here beside the lake 
mcgrane said angrily

   no further harm can come to him
now erskine answered gravely

  and montresor-montresor who
murdered him demanded the coach-
man  are you going to let montresor
get a better start on the police than hes
got already 

   the police must not get montresor
until after we get something montresor
has had in his possession you have heard

 

me make a promise to the man who came
to his death at montresors hands

   that promise must be kept but it
cannot be kept if montresor is arrested
or if you and i are compelled to remain in
chicago to-morrow to appear as witnesses
in this case in the dead mans interest
and in his fathers as well we have an-
other account to square with montresor
in order to do this we must take a train
for the west to-night

   we are going after montresor
if it is possible we must go before
him to the place at which we are to call
him to account for injuries which mem-
bers of the warrington family have suf-
fered at his hands

   but i dont understand sir how-
 it is unnecessary that you should un-
derstand anything more than that mon-
tresor is planning to obtain possession of
something which we must get-something
which was responsible for the death of
joseph warrington to-night i will lead
the way but you must remember that
when you entered my employ a few min-
utes ago you promised that you would
ask no questions

    i too have given a similar promise
to some one else there is a hard fight
ahead of us barney and some of it is
going to be in the dark but we must stand
together and be able to trust each other
absolutely

   weve got to fight then without
knowin what it is were fightin for

   yes barney botli of us are under
sealed orders

  the coachman hesitated well sir
if its a fight were goin into and the fel-
ler we have to fight is montresor barney
mcgrane is the man for the work and he
wont be pesterin you with questions he
said

    come then erskine directed with a
ring of impatience in his voice

   just as the two men were in the act of
crossing lake shore drive a coupe swift-
ly rounding a corner below them headed
northward and as it did so the driver
reined in his horse in a manner that caused
it to proceed at a slow canter erskine
and his companion were in the middle of
the roadway when the vehicle passed them

   erskine drew back suddenly and a low
incoherent expression fell from the lips
of mcgrane the occupant of the coupe
	the railroad mans magazine

had been recognized by both it was
louise warrington	

chapter x
a crossing of trails

 vyapiti falls the next stop--
    next stop wapiti falls 

  as this call rang- through the train
barney mcgrane saw a faintly percep-
tible expression of grimness settle in the
eyes and around the lips of his new em-
ployer who for the last two hours had
appeared to be absorbed in the perusal of
a paper novel

  a moment later the glances of the two
men met erskine smiled slightly laid
his book aside thrust his hands into his
pockets stretched himself and looked out
of the window

  barney mcgrane never had deluded
himself with the idea that he was adept
at mind-reading and if he had his lack
of success in studying the features of er-
skine with whom he had been traveling
for the greater part of two days might
well have discouraged him the face of
the altoona man had been like a mask
but in the eyes of this dogged enemy of
montresors there was a glint that never
died away and it pleased the irishman
to see it there

  during the greater part of this long
journey erskine had had little to say
when he did speak however his words
and manner were cheerful enough but
not once had he spoken of the quest in
which he wasengaged or of the death of
joseph warrington

  to the speculative mcgrane only one
thing was clear the ticket he carried
had given him to understand that their
destination was wapiti falls and he re-
membered that while he and erskine had
stood together beside lake michigan just
prior to the appearance of joseph war-
rington he had heard montresor say to
the man he called slevin something of
this town which the train was now ap-
proaching he had failed however to
grasp the significance of the speech

  as erskine looked out of the window
a feeling of apprehension suddenly began
to steal over him was it not possible
after all that he had been following a
false trail  in the darkness on the beach

he had heard montresor say to slevin that
the inter-state had  the paper and that
it transferred  to the dale  at wapiti
falls he knew that the inter-state and
the dale were express companies but
was  the paper  that had been mentioned
something else than the missing bonds

  this doubt was sufficiently disquieting
of itself but there was another that har-
assed him if the paper should con-
sist of the bonds he sought would it be
possible for him to obtain possession of
them by means of the desperate plan that
he had formulated

  of the one thousand dollars which he
had received from andrew warrington
he had spent less than one hundred and
fifty and the remainder was now in a
wallet in an inside pocket of his vest
large as this sum would have seemed to
him only a few days before he wondered
whether it would suffice for the work that
had been cut out for him

  the altoona mans thoughts were not
altogether occupied with the task that
confronted him however after leaving
chicago he had been haunted by a fear
that he had done wrong in failing to re-
port to andrew warrington concerning
the manner in which his son had met his
death despite warringtons injunction
to refrain from offering any report on the
progress he was making in his quest er-
skine felt that he had taken the general
manager a little too literally

  it was plain that warrington was con-
vinced that his son was indeed guilty of
the act with which he had been charged
and that though harboring this suspicion
he was determined that no evidence of his
sons complicity in the affair should be
submitted to him by the man to whom he
had assigned the task of recovering the
bonds it was also clear that the elder
warrington suspected that his son had
been in some sort of a conspiracy with
montresor

  but did he know enough of the nature
of this conspiracy to lead him to suspect
that montresor had designs on josephs
life by this time the general manager
knew that his son had been slain and it
was only natural that he should do all in
his power to aid the police in their search
for his murderer

  oftentimes as erskine asked himself
these questions he would become con-
without lights



scious of a sudden sinking feeling that
brought with it some of the sensations of
a nightmare and at these times his
thoughts were of louise warrington
was andrew warringtons daughter also
in league with montresor did she now
suspect that the man into whose hands she
had delivered erskine in lincoln park
was no other than the slayer of her
brother the very thought was mon-
strous and yet the fingers of accusing
circumstances pointed directly to her

  hour after hour the memory of this
extraordinary young woman haunted him
beautiful as she had been when she had
first appeared to him in her fathers house
it was not in this aspect that she kept re-
appearing to his fancy

  he remembered best the dark profile
beside him in the carriage and the white
face he had seen peering out at him from
the coupe window while he and mcgrane
had been crossing the lake shore drive
together near the warrington house a
few minutes after the death of her brother
j oseph

  erskine looked with unseeing eyes to-
ward the changing mountain scenes by
which the swiftly moving train was pass-
ing then he turned to mcgrane who
still sat facing him

   come over here barney he said
quietly

  the irishman seated himself at er-
skines side

   barney erskine went on  in three-
quarters of an hour we shall leave the
train at wapiti falls how soon we shall
get away from there i dont know but
while we are at the place we must keep
as well out of sight as possible it is not
unlikely that we shall see there some one
whom both of us have seen before

  if we do so keep your head and pre-
vent him from seeing you if he sees you
or me it is probable that our long jour-
ney out here will have been made in vain
is this clear to you 

   yes sir replied the irishman mov-
ing uneasily as he spoke  but suppose
the blackguard gets away

   dont let the thought of that trouble
you barney said erskine reassuringly
 he will get away from there without
any hindrance from us but if all goes
well we will be off ahead of him

  it is not at wapiti falls that i ex-

pect to land him but it will be at wapiti
falls that we must shape ourselves for
the fight which we will have to put up
within the next twenty-four hours-a
fight which unless we play our cards
pretty carefully is likely to have far more
serious consequences for both of us than
you can possibly imagine

   i aint thinkin of no consequences
mr erskine so long as we can get our
hooks into the sneakin whelp we are
after answered mcgrane with a shrug
of his broad shoulders  but what kind
of a fight is it like to be sir 

   well we might be so hard put to it
that we will be compelled to use almost
anything that we may find handy for our
purpose said the altoona man thought-
fully

   theres guns in your suit-case sug-
gested mcgrane now venturing to speak
for the first time of a subject which here-
tofore he thought it desirable to avoid

  true erskine assented you are
familiar with the use of a revolver i be-
lieve

   ive served with the british army in
india responded mcgrane

   so youve told me but the revolver

i	am going to give to you is loaded only
with blank cartridges

   with blanks  exclaimed the irish-
man disappointed

   thats all and when the time comes
for you to use them i think you will find
that they are the only sort that you will
require i scarcely think that you will
have an opportunity to get a shot at mon-
tresor

   then there aint goin to be no real
fight after all   muttered mcgrane in
an aggrieved tone

   oh yes im afraid that well have
about fifty-seven varieties of fight before
we finish the business we have ahead of
us but in the end you will admit that we
will have done well to begin with blank
cartridges

  the irishman looking open-mouthed
through the window nodded perfuncto-
rily it was plain that the prospect was
not sufficiently sanguinary to conform
with his idea of the fitness of things

  wapiti falls was reached at last and
as the train slowed down erskine and
mcgrane reached for their suit-cases and
sauntered out to the platform of the car


the railroad mans magazine

they were the first to alight and with
his hat drawn well down over his eyes
erskine glancing sharply about him led
the way to the baggage-room

   just outside this he paused and setting
down his suit-case looked toward one of
the forward cars of the train from which
he had just alighted on the side of the
car was painted the name  inter-state
express company

  despite the composure of his features
erskines heart was beating wildly as he
saw the big door on the side of the car
slowly open and a large truck draw up
beneath it

  package after package was transferred
from the car to the truck which being
filled at last was drawn in the direction
of the baggage-room a moment later
however a second truck was wheeled into
place and the hopes of erskine revived
only to die away again when a long green
canoe was thrust toward it from the car

   look sir-for gods sake look 
exclaimed mcgrane as with a trembling
hand he clutched erskines sleeve

   startled by the horrified accents of his
companion erskine followed the direc-
tion of his glance looking at him from
a window of one of the pullmans was the
face of the young woman he had seen peer-
ing out of the coupe on the lake shore
drive shortly after joseph warrington
had breathed his last-the face of the
dead mans sister a strange hunted
look was in her eyes and her face was as
gray as ashes

  that the young woman had seen and
recognized him there could be no doubt
why was she here where was mon-
tresor 

chapter xi
caught in the whirlpool

completely bewildered by the
sudden appearance of louise war-
rington whom until only a moment ago
he had believed to be still in chicago
erskine stared at her with dilated eyes
for a moment the young woman returned
his gaze then with a quick movement
she disappeared from the window

  slowly erskines scattered wits came
back to him again and as they did so he
suddenly became conscious of the danger

of his situation having seen and recog-
nized him louise now would take advan-
tage of the first opportunity that presented
itself to communicate with montresor and
thus put him on his guard

  picking up the suit-case which he had
set down on the platform of the station
erskine turned to mcgrane  come
barney we must get out of this he said
quietly

  the irishman nodded and was follow-
ing erskine into the baggage-room when
the altoona man turned abruptly and
glanced in the direction of the truck to
which the green canoe had been trans-
ferred from the express-car as he did
so he saw that two of the truckmen were
placing in the bottom of the canoe a
square box that had rope handles at the
ends

  again mcgrane clutched erskines
arm  thats her sir-gettin out-with
the veil  the coachman whispered

  the eyes of the altoona man did not
shift their gaze from the box in the canoe

   and-oh lord love us sir-her
mothers with her  the astonished irish-
man went on

  the truck containing the canoe and box
was now being rolled in the direction of
the baggage-room near the door of which
erskine and his companion were standing

   dont let them get out of your sight
barney directed erskine in a low husky
voice

   theyre goin to the waitin-room
said mcgrane

  into the baggage-room now rolled the
truck which erskine had been watching
the searching gaze of the altoona man
was riveted on the box that lay in the
canoe at one end of the box he read the
words  anxell typewriter

  erskines heart was beating wildly and
perspiration broke out in large drops on
his forehead fie was standing within six
feet of the object of his quest in one
corner of the baggage-room was an office
of the dale express company and to-
ward this the truck was being drawn by
two sturdy porters

  in a low voice erskine addressed mc-
grane

   take a good look at that box in the
canoe barney he said  when we land
that we shall be ready for montresor

  the irishman turning quickly gazed
without lights



at the mysterious box with wondering
eyes

    will you recognize itwhen you see it
again   erskine asked

  mcgrane nodded  i think i will
sir he answered dubiously

   then get to the waiting-room and
keep an eye on the women directed
erskine  keep out of their sight if
you can and above all dont let yourself
be seen by montresor

  in another moment the irishman was
gone erskine slowly sauntered after the
truck which finally came to a standstill
near the dale companys office

   leaning over the canoe with an affecta-
tion of carelessness erskine read the ad-
dress 

   charles falquist heath house ta-
   coma wash

  having learned this the young man
continued on until he came to the desk of
the office there he spoke to a clerk

    on what train do you make your next
shipment to tacoma  he asked

    on the seven-forty sir answered the
clerk

    but that is not the first train from
here to tacoma said erskine in a tone
of surprise

   the west coast express leaves here
at four-thirty but the cascade limited
passes it at tyrcone fifty miles the other
side of the dumb-bell and arrives in
tacoma more than an hour earlier ex-
plained the clerk

   erskine nodded and as he turned away
he looked at his watch it was twenty
minutes after four the west coast ex- -
press would leave in ten minutes

  as carelessly as he appeared to have
entered it erskine made his way out of
the baggage-room on the station plat-
form he paused and looked around  then
assured that montresor or the warring-
ton ladies were not in sight he directed
his steps toward the waiting-room just
as he entered the door of this mcgrane
touched him on the arm

    theyre sittin over yonder in the
corner lie explained

   have you seen montresor erskine
asked

    no sir replied the irishman

  in the corner that mcgrane had indi-
cated erskine saw a veiled woman sitting

beside a portly woman with white hair
he perceived also that from where the
two women were sitting they were unable
to command a view of one of the ticket
windows

  to this window he accordingly made
his way and there purchased two tickets
for tacoma by the west coast express
this done he returned to the station plat-
form and took a position just outside the
waiting-room door

    did you get the box sir  whispered
the irishman innocently

    not yet barney replied the other
smiling grimly

   then we aint ready yet for mon-
tresor mcgrane muttered with a sigh

    nearly ready barney said erskine

   from the east came a long shrill whis-
tle of an approaching locomotive  this
is our train i guess erskine murmured

  the irishman started and darted a
sharp glance toward the face of his com-
panion  were leavin wapiti falls
he asked abruptly

    yes

  mcgrane scowled  the sight of miss
warrington has changed your mind then
he growled

   no erskine replied  we go with
the box i pointed out to you i have told
you that not until we get possession of
that box can we fight it out with mon-
tresor

   but miss warrington-what is miss
warrington doing here 

   erskine shrugged his shoulders  that
is her secret-and montresors he an-
swered gloomily

   the irishman started and looked at his
companion quizzically

    you aint goin to make any trouble
for miss warrington   he said doggedly

  not if we can convince her that it
is in her interest to break away from mon-
tresor

   a grayish pallor overspread the face of
mcgrane  you-you dont think sir
that miss warrington has come all the
yay out here to meet that murderin eng-
lishman he faltered

    it looks like it barney

    after what hes done to her brother 

    it is probable that she does not know
that montresor is responsible for her
brothers death

   hut she knows that mr joseph is


the railroad mans magazine

dead and knowin that why wouldnt
she wait over in chicago until after the
funeral  asked the bewildered irishman

   the fact that she is here and accom-
panied by her mother indicates that they
left chicago before the body of young
warrington was found it is apparent
that they came on the same train that
brought us here this as you will remem-
ber left chicago shortly after daylight

  mcgrane nodded gloomily then after
a pause he said  that looks likely
enough sir but if we was to tell them
that mr joseph is dead and how it all
happened dont you suppose that would
be enough to make miss warrington
break away from montresor 

   they would insist on some corrobora-
tion of our story and an hour or more
might elapse before they would succeed in
obtaining this we cannot afford to wait
of one thing however we may be sure
miss warrington and her mother are
going the way of the box which within
the next twenty-four hours must be in our
possession that way is ours and it is not
improbable that we shall have the two
ladies as fellow passengers

  as erskine finished speaking the west
coast express slowed down at the station
platform with his ticket and berth
checks in one hand and his suit-case in
the other erskine hurried toward the
train with mcgrane at his heels a
porter conducted them to the section which
erskine had engaged

  as they seated themselves both men
glanced out of a window that commanded
a view of the station platform a mo-
ment later they saw miss warrington and
her mother leave the waiting-room and
move quickly toward the train miss war-
rington who still wore her veil glanced
from right to left but whether she was
looking for erskine and his companion
or for montresor was a matter of conjec-
ture so far as the altoona man was con-
cerned

  in less than half a minute the young
woman had again disappeared from er-
skines view and he doubted not that she
was ascending the steps to the platform
of the car rising abruptly he made his
way to the rear of the car in which he had
been seated

  he had taken only a few paces how-
ever when he saw her just before she dis-

appeared in the stateroom at the end of
the car satisfied that she was indeed on
the train erskine returned to his seat

  as he sat down the irishman looked at
him interrogatively erskine nodded but
did not speak mcgrane compressed his
lips and looked out of the window with
the exceptions of erskine mcgrane and
the two women who had entered the state-
room all the other occupants of the car
had been on the train at the time it arrived
at wapiti falls

  five minutes after erskine returned to
his seat the train drew out of the station
as it did so mcgrane who occupied the
front seat leaned forward and addressed
erskine who sat facing him

  aint seen him yet- the irishman
asked in a hoarse whisper

  erskine shook his head mcgrane sank
back dejectedly the younger man then
took from his pocket a time-table which
he had been studying at various times
while he was riding between chicago and
wapiti falls after looking this over for
several minutes he glanced out of the
window then rose abruptly

   ill be back in a few minutes bar-
ney he said shortly

  a moment later he was standing before
the closed door of the stateroom which he
had seen miss warrington enter after a
brief period of hesitation he set his lips
firmly and knocked

       chapter xii
       a sinister shadow

yxith a rapidly beating heart er-
skine waited for an answer to his
knock this was so long in coming that
he was about to knock again when the
door opened and louise warrington with
her veil thrown back stood before him
the young womans face was very pale
her eyes were red and there were dark
circles under her eyes

  erskine had expected that the young
woman would receive him with some mani-
festation of surprise on the contrary
however he found her singularly self-
possessed for several seconds she re-
garded him gravely then in a low quiet
voice she said

   come in

  erskine bowed entered and closed the
without lights



door behind him louise seated herself
beside her mother who surveyed erskine
coldly the young woman looked out of
the window

  as erskine stood awkwardly just inside
the closed door the train rounded a curve
so quickly that the young man almost lost
his footing he quickly recovered his
equilibrium and addressing mrs war-
rington he asked

   may i sit down 

  ignoring the question mrs warring-
ton turned toward the window as her
daughter had done erskine flushed pain-
fully it was plain that both ladies re-
sented his intrusion and were not disposed
to converse with him doubtless louise
believed him to be nothing more than an
ordinary detective who had been assigned
by her father to watch her movements

   if this were so he scarcely could charge
her with lack of courtesy it was mani-
festly impossible for him to carry on con-
versation while trying to maintain his
balance in a swaying car so reluctantly
enough he dropped his hat in the vacant
seat opposite mrs warrington and her
daughter and sat down beside it for
more than a minute the silence was un-
broken erskine was the first to speak

    i am sorry to intrude upon you in this
manner miss warrington but circum-
stances compel me to do so-in the inter-
est of both of us he said

   i am not aware sir that we have any
interest in common the young woman
answered frigidly and without turning
her head

   i think that when you come to know
me better that you will recognize the fact
that in some respects at least we have
several interests in common said er-
skine gravely

   i have no desire to know you better
sir retorted the young woman now flash-
ing toward him a glance in which resent-
ment and contempt were blended

  	it will be well however for you to
hear something which i have come here to
tell you

  louise shrugged her shoulders  only
a matter of considerable importance would
justify your presence here she answered
shortly

   i am quite aware of that said er-
skine flushing  but in speaking of it

i should like to feel that i am not mis-

understood it will be better therefore
for me to put you in the way of learning
from others something which you prob-
ably would not credit were you to hear it
from me

   louise looked at him quizzically  to
what  others  do you refer 

   to your father or any of your inti-
mate friends who are not under the influ-
ence of mr montresor

  the young woman flushed angrily and
looked at erskine steadfastly saying

    your meaning is so obscure that im
afraid i cannot grasp it what is it that
you are so disposed to put me in the way
to hear 

    the report of a misfortune that has
befallen your brother

  the young woman started violently
and a stricken look came into her eyes
her mother gave utterance to a little cry
and facing erskine impulsively grasped
her daughters hand

   what misfortune has befallen my
son mrs warrington demanded

  and now erskine suddenly realized
that he had blundered he knew that
this revelation should not have been made
until after he should have attempted to
win the confidence of the two women by
other means

  well sir why do you not speak
the elder woman asked impatiently

    i should advise you to telegraph to
mr warrington asking him if anything
has happened to your son said erskine

   i have not asked you for advice
mrs warrington retorted  you pro-
fess to know that something has happened
to him tell me what it is

  again erskine hesitated louise laid
a hand on her mothers shoulder

   do not let this man alarm you
mother the younger woman said reas-
suringly  he has been paid to spy upon
us and thus far he has succeeded now
in order to compel us to turn back to chi-
cago he is trying to make us believe that
something serious has happened to joe

    he is only a detective mother and it
is the practise of detectives to lie whenever
they think a lie will aid them in attaining
their ends this man has planned the
thing with father who if we telegraph to
him will reply of course that joe is in
trouble and that we must return at once

    you have said enough miss warring-


the railroad mans magazine

ton and i will leave you he answered
in a voice that shook a little  before i
go however it is only fair to explain that
the man who was introduced to you by
your father as you were preparing to go
to the opera was not a professional detec-
tive nor was he one who willingly under-
took the task on which he is now engaged
-a task which he little thought would
expose him to your enmity

   these explanations are quite unneces-
sary louise answered coldly

   nevertheless i am determined to
make this one said erskine doggedly
 you are right when you infer that my
introduction to you by your father was
for the purpose of affording me an oppor-
tunity to meet mr montresor

   you found that opportunity i be-
lieve retorted louise

   erskine colored slightly but as grave-
ly as before he answered  yes and had
it not been for that meeting i should not
be here to-day so despite the assault that
was made upon me on that evening i have
much to thank you for you are wrong
however in assuming that it is part of my
duty to keep you and your mother under
surveillance

   our meeting at the station which we
have just left was quite accidental

   accidental  louise exclaimed in-
credulously  do you ask me to believe
that you did not follow me to the train
which brought me to wapiti falls 

   whether i followed or preceded you
to that train i do not know i certainly
had no suspicion that you were on it until
i saw you at wapiti falls

   then why are you here  

  steadily returning the half-mocking
half-defiant gaze of the young woman
who confronted him erskine hesitated
then his white face grew more tense as in
a low deliberate voice he answered her

   i am here to save from disgrace every
member of the family whose name you
bear and to bring to the bar of justice the
man who robbed then murdered your
brother 

  with a cry of horror mrs warring-
ton half rose from her seat louise
scarcely less agitated than her mother
seized her arm and drew her back

  murdered the elder woman whis-
pered hoarsely

to be

     when demanded louise in whose
  eyes was an expression of incredulity

     just before you saw me crossing the
  drive in front of your house-while you
  were returning from-the opera

     you-you were with mcgrane  the
  young woman faltered

    yes at the time that your brother
  was assaulted mcgrane was with him
  both were overpowered and your brother
  received a wound from which he died a
  few minutes afterward

    a strange calmness came over louise
   where did the assault take place  she
  asked with trembling lips

      on the lake front below the sea-wall
  in front of your house

     how did you happen to be there 

     mcgrane told me that montresor
 sometimes went to that spot-to talk with
 your brother or to receive messages from
 his friends

    overcome by the manifestations of the
  pain which necessity had compelled him
  to inflict on these two women the young
  man allowed his gaze to fall louise con-
  tinued to regard him searchingly then
  in a cold quiet voice she spoke

     my father told me that mcgrane had
  been drinking and that for this reason he
  had been discharged she said  it is
  only natural therefore to infer that he
  was angry at our family as well as in-
  toxicated while you were with him are
  you sure that in the darkness you did not
  mistake my brother for the man who had
  assaulted you in lincoln park

    the altoona man grew livid

     you-you mean- he stammered

    as he hesitated louise with an arm
  around her sobbing mother straightened
  herself slowly then leaning toward er-
  skine she said

      i mean that i shall communicate at
  once with chicago and if i find that any
  calamity has befallen my brother i shall
  cause you to be followed to the very ends
  of the earth  

    with flashing eyes the young woman
  rose and pointed to the door

     go  she commanded sternly

    too dumfounded to reply or move
 erskine stood staring helplessly at his
 beautiful accuser was she only acting
 a part or did she really harbor the sus-
 picion which her lips had just expressed

surveying the bad lands

by bertram adler

the boys who started out to  win the west  by laying two strips of steel
over a right of way and especially those intrepid heroes-the surveyors
-encountered romance and adventure in the truest sense of those
much-abused words breaking into an unknown wilderness without guides
hunting the wild beasts for food dodging indians that hovered in ambush-
these were but a few of the obstacles that stood in the way of the men who
broke through our frontier to open new lands of wealth and wonder

those days have gone their men and the achievements of those men
are history we live in the great era of commerce that their work produced

desperate encounters with indians and other hardships of the men
who made the preliminary survey for the northern pacifics
route from the great lakes to puget sound

h cotter messenger for the
northern pacific express
company at spokane wash-
ington where he has been
employed for the last twenty-
five years was with the stan-
ley party in  when the northern pa-
cific railroad made its preliminary survey
through what is now north dakota

   in the spring of  said mr cot-
ter  i was employed by the northern
pacific railroad at brainerd minnesota
the company was just starting its over-
land road from the great lakes to puget
sound the road was built only as far
as brainerd at that time and in opera-
tion while west of brainerd the graders
were at work between the mississippi and
the red river

   e c winne was purchasing-agent
for the company furnishing all supplies
stores horses and wagons needed in the
engineering department for the construc-
tion of the road

   having several parties out on the
line it was necessary to have horses to
transport their camps and supplies mr
winhe went to st paul to purchase
horses i received a telegram from him
to report to him at st paul and to take
a car-load of horses to fargo north da-
kota we had to ship the horses by way
of the st paul and breckenridge which
was the only road running at that time

   when i arrived at breckenridge i
had to go sixty miles overland to fargo
west of fargo there were engineering-
camps strung along which had to be sup-
plied with provisions and outfits and the
graders camps between the red river
on the north and the missouri river

   i was instructed to take a telegraph
outfit through to jim town one hundred
miles west of fargo arriving there with
an operator i reported by wire to mr
winne this was the first message over
the line

   i received instructions from him by

the railroad mans magazine

wire to proceed to bismarck on the mis-
souri river to accompany an expedition
for laying out the preliminary line of the
northern pacific through to yellowstone
bismarck being the starting-point of the
expedition

   camp was fixed at bismarck and the
expedition was to start about the middle
of july supplies and everything being
brought up the missouri river by steam-
boat

the sioux hunting-grounds

   we crossed the river on the steam-
boat the middle of july the engineer-
ing forces were under the immediate
command of general rosser a noted cav-
alry officer of the southern forces in the
civil war

   the country west of the missouri
river was wild and the route through the
sioux hunting - grounds was dangerous
it was necessary to have an escort of sol-
diers and government troops general
stanley was in command at fort stand-
ing rock with six hundred troops under
his immediate command and equipped
with forty re-scouts with louis agard
one of the most notable guides of the
west in charge

   the engineering-party started from
fort abraham lincoln while the com-
mand under general stanley started from
fort standing rock two days march
brought the columns together fort lin-
coln was being built at that time

   there were sixty-five government
wagons one hundred two-mule wagons
and the engineering department had twen-
ty four-horse wagons which hauled sup-
plies camp and baggage there were
two surveying-parties of twenty men each
surveying two preliminary lines and a
guard of soldiers with each

striking the bad lands

   in our line of march the re-scouts
were in the lead scouring the country
watching for the sioux tribe we pro-
ceeded west till we struck the bad lands
which was once a vast coal-field and had
been burning for years fires were burn-
ing when we reached the bad lands
which are twenty miles wide and extend
from the black hills on the southwest

to the missouri river on the northeast
the little missouri river traversed the
whole length of the bad lands

   the first night in the bad lands one
of our hunters killed a bear and we had
meat for supper and breakfast these
hunters went ahead with the re - scouts
killed the game marked the meat for
each company and left it lying where we
would pick it up as we came along we
had two hunters for each party

   arriving at the little missouri river
we had to camp there a week on account
of high water in going through the bad
lands we had a skirmish-line out on each
side of the train to protect us and from
that time on we kept a skirmish-line out
as the indians were beginning to be trou-
blesome

a narrow escape

   one night we made a dry camp we
had to go out and hunt for water the
scouts reported water a mile and a half
from us down in the gulch where we
could not get a place to camp we had
orders to go there for water with guards
for protection

  john bear and i took the lead we
got within twenty rods of the water but
the indians were in ambush and if it had
not been for the soldiers coming up at
the time i would not be here to tell the
story 

   we were attacked one night and had
to call out the troops shots were fired
back and forth but no damage was done
no one was killed

  arriving at the head of ofallon
creek in a valley three-quarters of a mile
wide with bluffs on each side the in-
dians attacked us again riding up on top
of the ridges and shooting down at the
party

   the skirmish-line  each side of the
train climbed the mountains and drove off
the indians there were one hundred
and fifty reds in the party as near as we
could learn louis agard our guide was
known to many of the indians and he
rode out to the camp and talked to them

   they notified him that they were go-
ing to kill us as we were going through
their hunting-grounds and that was what
they did not like

 the night of the attack on ofallon
surveying the bad lands



  creek five of the
  re-scouts were
  missing the next
  morning at dawn
  they came into
  camp their horses -
  reeking with sweat

    the indians had
  been chasing them
  all night but they
  managed to keep
  out of their way

     while camped
  on our backward
  - journey thirty
  miles from t h e
  yellowstone
  river general
  rosser  with one
  guide and an es-
  cort of two had to
  make a trip back
  to the mouth of
  powder river he
  made the trip in-
  side of twenty-
  four hours luckily
  not seeing an in-
  dian although
  there were plenty
  of them around
  watching

   the indians
 in those days used
 looking- glass-
 es to make signals

  we could see them
  giving signs nearly every day reflecting
  with the sunlight across the prairies for
  miles

     every man was furnished with a
  needle-gun and a belt of cartridges sup-
  plied by the government the guns to be
  returned to the government when we ar-
  rived back at fort lincoln

      at that time it was thought that gold
  would be found in plenty in the yellow-
  stone river

     we had in our party many gold pros-
  pectors and hunters who took the trip
  to seek for gold at nearly every creek
  we would come to we would see them out
  with their pans washing for color these
  prospectors and hunters would drive the
  horses for us and do work about the
  camp just to be along with the party

     while we were camped at bismarck

before we crossed
the river we could
see through our
telescopes the re-
scouts and the
sioux fighting six
miles away one
night the indians
came to the camp
and shot through
the wagons but
hurt no one

    the next sun-
rise we broke camp
but before the last
wagon left the in-
dians attacked us
again general
stanley ordered us
into corral imme-
diately on the run
the indians fought
us for three hours
but were finally
chased off by the
scouts and the
skirmish-lines

   we proceeded
down the creek un-
til we struck the
the yellow-
stone river fol-
lowing the yellow-
stone up to the
powder river
where we expected
to meet a survey-
ing-party which had started from hele-
na montana at the same time that we
started from fort lincoln

    we camped at the mouth of powder
river with no signs of the other party
while at this camp the engineering de-
partment was running a line a few miles
farther they were attacked by the in-
dians and one of the party became sep-
arated but the re-scouts came to his as-
sistance and saved his life

    while at that camp on the yellow-
stone river the men decided to go in
bathing there were about two hundred
of us in swimming when the indians ap-
 proached from the opposite side of the
river and began firing on us

    the men did not have time to dress

who was with the northern pacifics
surveying-party in s


the railroad mans magazine

general stanley ordered the cannon un-
limbered and fired a few shells across the
river driving the indians away we lay
in camp two weeks waiting for the other
party from helena but could hear noth-
ing from them we started on the return
and camped again on ofallon creek

provisions getting low

   as our provisions were getting low
it was thought necessary to start part of
the train back to bismarck after pro-
visions while the rest of the department
was surveying we had orders to leave the
camp at twelve oclock night so that the
indians would not know that the party
had separated

   we left camp in two columns with a
skirmish-line  each side for protection
and traveled until sunrise

   while at breakfast our scouts on the
lead reported a courier advancing this
courier had left bismarck three days be-
fore traveling day and night with des-
patches stating that the surveying-party
from helena which was to meet us at
powder river had been compelled to
turn back on account of the indians

   these despatches had to go by courier
from the engineering-camp to helena
montana then by wire to omaha from
omaha to st paul by wire and from st
paul to fort abraham lincoln by wire
and thence by courier to our camp

   the indians had driven the other
party back and general stanley was ad-
vised to be  his guard as the redskins
were coming to drive him back also the
courier took breakfast with us and pro-
ceeded on his way

a running fight

   we traveled as fast as we could to
fort lincoln for our supplies loading
up as soon as possible we started back
again not knowing where we would meet
the other party but expecting them in the
bad lands of the little missouri

   arriving at that river on our second

trip we could find no trace of the expe-
dition we sent the two scouts out to hunt
for the engineers they were driven in by
the indians one of the horses was shot
through the head but able to bring its
rider in the other scout returned with
a bullet-hole through his coat

   next day we sent out ten scouts who
had a running fight with the indians but
they located the surveying-party we
stayed in camp on the little missouri un-
til the other party came the indians
sent word that they would kill us all

   one day as we were on the inarch
the lieutenant was outside of the skirmish-
line hunting antelopes the indians shot
and killed him several indians rode up
to scalp him one dismounted and just
as he was about to put his hand on our
comrades hair general rosser shot him

wouldnt scalp a negro

   a short time after that on the same
day a colored cook was hunting antelope
with a white bulldog the indians killed
the cook and the dog too but would not
scalp the negro  account of his curly
hair

   they stripped him and left him and
the dog side by side the lieutenant and
the cook were both buried by the troops

   we returned to the missouri river
october  this being the first prelimi-
nary line surveyed for the northern pa-
cific west of the missouri river an-
other expedition was sent out in 
and ran a preliminary line several miles
from the one we made but it was not
until after general terrys command
which was out in  at the time that
general custer and his gallant troops of
the seventh cavalry of three hundred
were massacred on the little big horn
that the northern pacific could start gra-
ding on the west of the missouri the
engineers and graders had to be protected
by troops during their work at that time
it was a wild unbroken country to-
day it is covered by farms and prosperity
reigns supreme

bill daidys chapter

       by robert fulkerson hoffman

          a sharp-tongued engineer wins recognition
          kicking everything in sight and then some

t is a feature of the glad free
  life of this republic that every
  man is entitled to an opinion
  on everything under the sun
  and within wide limits is en-
  titled to the unrestricted ex-
  pression of that opinion

  bill daidy is one of those who believe
there is good in the large exercise of that
privilege although of late years he has
added caution to candor

  in the old days he came in off his en-
gine loaded with the usual accumulation
of griefs over the shortcomings of the
roundhouse which are apt to loom large
in the long watches of the night-run

  fie gradually grew the habit of closing
his regular harangue to the roundhouse
foreman with a sort of peroration which

you a chapter when my boy gets fit with
his machine

  so daidy in his evenings at home took
to rehearsing his daily griefs to the boy
who laboriously hammered them out of
the typewriter into grotesques of composi-
tion and the printers art

  meanwhile the boy grew rapidly in the
skill of the machine while bills ideas of
his wrongs and tribulations went farther
and farther afield but became more clean-
cut and pointed as he put them to the cold
test of reading

  daidy dictated and revised killed
copy  and  edited although he did not
know it in those terms and after many
days what he had grown to call  the
chapter  was finished decked out with
border-lines that fairly exhausted the re-

summed up the real or imaginary derelic- sources of the boy and the eighty-odd
tions of everybody connected with the characters of the machine

road from call-boy to president

  in an effort to break the flow of bills
rough eloquence the roundhouse foreman
unwittingly set bills feet upon the path
that led upward-downward bill laugh-
ingly insists sometimes

   bill why in thunder dont you write
a book  said the long-suffering foreman
when bill had become more than usually
aggressive in his none too gentle impeach-
ments  you are sure wasting your tal-
ent on an engine

  bill glared for a moment before he was
able to let down the pressure of road
management which he had mentally as-
sumed and then as the recollection of a
purchase he had recently made for his
growing son flashed across his mind he
gave way to a slow grin and said 

   blamed if i dont believe thats a
good idea ballard maybe ill just go

   bill gloated over it for a week of nights
and then liked it so well that he decided
to have it all done over again in order
that he might not only supply ballard
but also send carbon copies of it surrep-
titiously to the superintendent of motive
power the division superintendent and-
holy of holies-the general manager

  fie shrank somehow from including
the master mechanic who had a convin-
cing and abrupt way of puncturing bub-
bles therefore that able gentleman was
for the time being blissfully unaware that
the seeds of a great accomplishment were
germinating within his bailiwick

  the superintendent of motive power
duly received his copy threw it in the
waste-basket and remarked casually
 bill 

  fie liked bill but not bills too free
excoriations




the railroad mans magazine

  the division superintendent read his
copy and laughing pigeonholed it for
future use in letting down the pressure of
the superintendent of motive power when
next they should lock horns over engine-
failures

  the general manager took up his copy
from its personal cover and read it from
start to finish as follows

chapter one

if this dont fit your case you get a clear-
ance card right here the board is out
for others

  when you build an engine and want the
most results and dont care what kind fix
yourself with a lot of discouraged drafts-
men and for chief get a good wrangler that
talks into his whiskers and dont decide
much

  tell them fellows at the start that you
put them into that cheese-box office to stay
and they cant break out onto the road to see
an engine do business noways

  dont pay any of them too much they
are working on paper and you can easily fix
the engine after we get it

  hire a lot of master mechanics that know
all about sawmills there aint none around
here but you can see them running in the
woods if you take a ride with me they will
be ready to lay up your new engine when
it comes out

  fix up boiler steel specifications that you
know are o k and then let the purchasing
agent bluff you into taking something better
but cheaper he can prove it that will sure
give a lift once in a while to some of us
fellows thats a little slow about circulating
in the scenery and it will make things brisk
in the boiler-shop them fellows need work
they are too strong to rest nights

  use hammered engine-frames if i was
a track-man id like to be able to put my
hand on a busted weld and say  thems it
after the engine jumped the track and got
pulled out of a borrow-pit the despatcher
wont care if she dont block the track
it makes work for the blacksmiths

  fix your spring-rigging so when it breaks
the equalizer will hit point down in the
track gives the engine a better start when
she jumps she will go farther and every-
thing had ought to be made go as far as it
can

  truck - pedestal binder - bolts should set
low enough to rip up a frosty plank cross-
ing it gives the engines a good name
as goers one nuts enough two stay on
too well

  put your driving-box wedge-bolts in a
safe-deposit box behind the driving-wheels

somebody might get at them with a wrench
on the road wedge-bolts had ought tp be
smelled or heard from when the journals
screech not seen

  if anybody thinks he wants to slack a
wedge-bolt let that man shoot the jamb-nuts
off with a gun thats what guns is for
and theyd ought to be carried in the tool-
kit

  the roundhouse gangs too good for the
job new engines dont run hot soon enough
to suit yours truly put a crew of hoboes in
there and tell them they got to save oil and
ram the cellar-packing down in with a pinch-
bar they will do it the babbitt and stuff
you drop over the division makes good bal-
last

  wall in your cellar-bolts so if a fellow
gets them out digging babbitt out of the cel-
lar on a fast run he cant get them in again
inside of fifteen minutes apiece the des-
patcher wont care-ask him-and the en-
gineer daresnt its all he can do to talk
his way out of a lay-off

  dont you worry about front-ends if
the engine looks good to you but dont steam
no more than a teakettle with the bottom out
let the trainmaster put on a helper once in
a while three or five years from now
somebody else will have your job anyhow
and hell set most of your front-end furni-
ture out on the scrap-pile while he cleans
house and forget to put it back again that
will help some

  when some fellow offers you one of them
superheaters or feed-water heaters with his
name stamped onto it tell him to go over
to the y m c a library and read an-
cient history on how them tilings was let
rust off of every sacred-ox cart in egypt
six thousand years before george stephen-
son-and why dont he go get a patent on
an incubator or something useful

  put the biggest smoke-stack onto her that
your money will buy without passing
dividends it makes what my old school-
master used to call  quiet dignity  like
big ears onto a jackass

  you can easily choke down the exhaust-
nozzle to suit and the general manager
aint ashamed to say that he dont know
back-pressure from lumbago hes a healthy
man or was the last time i pulled him and
cant bother about little fleas like them on
the railroad dog

  run out a long extension on the front
end its no good but it gives a bejolly look
that makes newspaper men gape at her and
say shes a wonder for speed thatll do
-the general passenger-agent good but he
knows it aint so

if you find theres rooms to rent in
the front end after you get it done and the
bill daidys chapter



heater men show up again without the incu-
bator fill her up with their stuff its hang
for us fellows but it helps hold the front
trucks down when youre going some

  bend your feed and air pipes as sharp and
as often as you can it shows that nobody
was looking and they freeze up quicker

  look out for your engine-cab fix it so
that if a fellow goes to the front door he
cant get back again to the throttle without
getting orders from the despatcher showing
that the main-line of the cab is clear

  put the injector the levers and brake-
valve where he cant get at them too soon
he will find them with a torch stand the
reverse-lever where it will corner him hard
against the cab in back-motion and throw
him out of the front door when he lets it
down to drift make it short and a hard
kicker dont put in a foot-rest he might
pull up the rails

  set the engineers brake-valve where the
handle will connect with a fellows brceches
when he climbs up or down and make a full
application or release it will make business
for the claim department and the man that
runs her will get a gift of gab that aint
found in  almanac-same as the rest of
s

  any man that says the valves rub the bal-
ance-plates is most generally mistaken if
the reverse-lever kicks clear of the quad-
rant and deals him a solar plexy-never
mind he cant swear until he comes to
and the passengers will blame it onto him
anyhow hes got to get there or get off
you know it

  when he wants the fit of cross-head keys
and spiders examined tell him it was the
main rod he heard its rich to let a cylinder-
head go out once in a while sounds patri-
otic and makes them fellows in the machine-
shop feel they are worth while

  the boy allows we are working too many
nights at this he wants a change we are
so dont you bother about fire-boxes and
ash-pans when the president sends word
that he couldnt see the right of way 
his last trip for smoke send him to me and
ill tell him he was  the wrong end of the
train it was all clear ahead of the engine

  thatll make him know that we are men
of some parts part wood anu part leather
with brass trimmings-which i am
yours truly

william daidy engineer

  it has been a number of years since
daidy handed his chapter duly sealed to
ballard in the roundhouse and ballard
pocketed it unopened as daidy went out
upon his run but ballard still has the
first page of it framed above his desk

in its what-not border composed of all
the claw-marks and constellations that
daidys invincible typewriter could pro-
duce

  ballard is not fortunately for him a
roundhouse foreman now and daidys
modest title of engineer has also under-
gone some changes for better

  it was with the general manager how-
ever that the seed of daidys rough-shod
sowing first took root although no intima-
tion of that reached daidy at the time
except in the master mechanics peremp-
tory challenge when bill arrived back
after a lay-over of two days at the farther
end of the division

   say demanded the master mechanic

 do you carry that cussed typewriter of
yours on the engine with you 

   naw bill answered promptly

   well said the master mechanic with
the absorbed air of hearing other things
than bills reply  you want to quit it

  daidy seeing farther than across the
right of way said no more but departed

  when a man has enough strength of
character to get his head above the level
of railroad waters however grotesquely
he may at first appear there is usually
something in him worth observing if he
has balance and staying powers he may
get his feet upon the solid and a leader
has been discovered

  somewhat in this fashion the general
manager reasoned as he read bills chap-
ter pie called his secretary and by
careful question and reply it was soon
established that neither of them knew
who william daidy was nor what of
williams chapter was fact and what
fancy

  therefore the general manager made
a brief investigation put some pointed
questions to the superintendent of motive-
power who fumed at little but electrified
the master mechanic as witness his short
and simple inquiry of bill and thus
bills little seeds began to grow apace

  changes were made plans were de-
vised and revised until new engines bore
signs of improvement these things were 
discussed on the home road and the news
of them went broadcast over many roads

   bills ideas bore the test of service and
flourished like the proverbial green bay
tree until finally they came before the
 first intelligence the  great area-


the railroad mans magazine

num or  court of last resort  of the
railroad mechanical world and were
called good no longer bearing the name
of  william daidy engineer it is true
but labeled with the names of many men
for that is the way of the world and the
destiny of all things that are good enough
to prove good

  but the  court of last resort  called
them good under whatever sponsorship
they then appeared and for those who

long ago read the lines of daidys chapter
and read between those lines as well there
is written large upon the modern loco-
motive the story that is written here

  bill never got beyond  chapter one 
of ballards  book there was no need
but having demonstrated that he was  a
man of parts it was thought advanta-
geous to transpose him to the ranks of
those he had smitten thus bill became
a road foreman of engines-and more

the brevity of railroad orders

british railroader thinks that those issued in america should contain
more information

the following interesting comment on
american methods appeared in a re-
cent issue of a london contemporary

   one feature that strikes a british railway
officer when visiting america is the frugal-
ity of the notices given to trainmen as to
signal changes as compared with those is-
sued in this country

   our practise is as a rule to have a
block showing the shape of the signal to
give its name distance from the signal-box
and position whether on the up or down
side of the line all new signal-boxes and
new or altered junctions cross-over roads
and other connections are described in great
detail these details to an american no
doubt appear unnecessary and possibly
they are so but they have contributed to
the great safety of british railways

   the brevity of the notice issued by the
lake shore and michigan southern rail-
road when the working of the lines between
chicago and elkhart was changed from
left-hand to right-hand running in july last
will point our remarks

  although the length of railway affected
is ninety miles the notice of the changes
and of the essential alteration to roads and
signals is contained in eighty lines from
which e extract the following

  rule d-ios will be modified as follows
where two main tracks are in service trains
will use the right-liand track unless other-
wise instructed when more than two main
tracks are in service instructions as to their
use will be given in the time-table

    the following new sidings will go into
service at the same time here follows
reference to seven sidings all the details of
which are given in fifteen lines

  at various stations track changes have
been made especially in cross-overs all
concerned should familiarize themselves
with the changes

    interlocking train order and automatic
block signals will be located either over or
upon the right of and adjoining the track
to which they refer 

  the change notwithstanding the lack of
information as to its extent was made with-
out any mishap or delay

  might it not be that the writer of the
above comment saw an apparent brevity in
the notice mentioned and failed to appre-
ciate that a vast amount of work had been
expended upon this notice to bring it down
to a form in which it could be most readily
and effectively comprehended by the engine-
man says the signal engineer

  the fact that the change-over was made
without any mishap or delay seems to prove
conclusively enough that the notice in its
final form was not too brief any implica-
tion in this comment that the prevailing prac-
tise of giving as little as is required in no-
tices of this character in america is a
contributory cause of unsafe operation is
entirely unwarranted

  operating officials in this country know
their roads and know their men if there
appears to be a seeming meagerness of de-
tail in the instructions that they give to en-
gine-men in cases of this kind it is because
they regard brevity a virtue so long as it
is not inconsistent with the full understand-
ing of the situation on the part of the engine-
man

  results prove that though the instructions
are brief they are not lacking in essential
information
letters of an old railroad
man and his son

by herman da costa

no -why the knocker always loses

jim suddenly discovers that a haughty gent has been placed over
him and he writes papa that hell resign
at once

jim to the old man

ear dad  for the last week
ive been as mad as a hor-
net bigby had to quit on
account of illness and
naturally i was right in
line for his job i held it
too for over three months while he was
away and got along first-rate-accord-
ing to what connolly said

 last monday morning connolly
brought a new man up to me and intro-
duced him as t fs new secretary

  for a moment i was flabbergasted
then i stood up shook hands and said
something and went back to work but
all day i felt as mean as a cat thats been
given a bath

  it didnt seem right and doesnt even
now that a fellow should come in and be
put over my head that way i remember
telling you that if a man deserved it he
ought to get promoted no matter who
was in the way butthe fact is that this
fellow doesnt know the next thing about
railroading and is as much able to do
the work as a salted mackerel

  for instance he wrote the general
manager of the b and d s w asking
him to explain how no  happened to
lose two hours on the illinois division
when even the office-boy knows that we
havent got anything- to do with the

series began id december  railroad man

                                            

 southwestern and have no business ask-
 ing them to explain delays unless we
 write them through the president

   we got a hot letter from burnsides of
 the southwestern he wrote direct to
 the president asking him if t f had so
 little to do that he wanted to butt in 
 another division the president sent for
 t f and mr private secretary got a
 grilling

   later i found out that some fat-head
 director had asked the president to ap-
 point this man as private secretary to
 some official and as this director was an
 influential man he was given the place
 that bigby left vacant

   its a shame i wouldnt mind it so
much but grand the new man is a
haughty cuss whose father and mother
are in society and he wont speak to you
like a decent fellow just a couple of
days ago he sent for me when  entered
the office he wheeled round in his chair

    take this letter britt he ordered

   take it yourself  i fired back

   he got red  youre insoleru will
you take this letter or wont you

    i wont i answered

   then i left him and went back to my
work in a minute or so he came out to
connolly and marched up to his desk
 i instructed that young man to receive
this dictation mr connolly he said
 and he refused to do so

        m a e a  n c single coplm  ceat


the railroad mans magazine

  he handed connolly die letter con-
nolly was pinning some correspondence
together and he forced a big pin through
it before he answered  thats all
right he replied  ill give it to him
mr britt lie called out  would you
mind taking this letter for me

  i took my book and hustled over to
connollys desk grand stood there for
a second frowning then went back in
the office when connolly got through
dictating he stopped me as i was going

  if you havent got much  hand and
he asks you to do work for him he said
 go ahead and do it i know you arent
supposed to do it but givell man enough
rope and hell hang himself

  of course connolly is right in what
he says but it makes me hot to have to
work for this man ive taken dictation
from him a couple times since but never
speak to him except  business

  he writes the worst fool stuff i ever
read but its not my duty to correct it
and i send it out just the way he gives
it to me as a result weve been called
down several times by the freight traffic
department it made t f mad as blazes
when burnsides pitched into him and
grand got a beautiful calling down

  im not feeling very much satisfied
about things if they can put in a man
ahead of me on account of pull im like-
ly to stay in one position forever i know
enough now about railroad work to fill
a position in almost any department and
ive been thinking about loolpng around
for something else

  still i hate leaving t f and the of-
fice theyve treated me all right and it
feels like home now but this  four-
flusher coming in with his aristocratic
airs is enough to upset anybody the
whole office has got it in for him he had
an argument with lynes and lynes al-
most punched his head

  t f has been out on the line twice
since the new man came and each time
he took him out with him i noticed
that both times he brought in a lot of
letters and gave them to me to answer
fie never did that with bigby so evi-
dently the new man isnt making any
great hit with t f

  i think ill look up a new place if i
cant locate anything i guess i will re-
sign and come back home to visit you for

a week or so but there are lots of places
around town and if i cant get suited
right away ill keep on moving around
until i get something good

    the b and d isnt such a great road
anyhow and its mighty mean to work a
game like this on me a road that will
give a man a good job on account of a
big pull isnt worth much anyhow

  the old man to jim

dear jim  some time before you were
born there were two men working for the

b	and d one was named lynes and
one connolly both worked as clerks in
the superintendents office both were
good men knew their business and stuck
to it

one day a fellow was brought in from
the outside and put over their heads at a
salary twenty-five dollars more than they
were getting lynes went right up in the
air about it he kicked and stormed and
knocked the road connolly took it quiet-
ly obeyed orders and when the other
fellow told him to do anything he did it

in about a months time lynes was
completely changed from being a
steady worker he grumbled continually
and disobeyed the new man and knocked
him to every one

at first people agreed with him tt
looked tough to have a job like that put
up on him and they told him so that
made him worse than ever but after
a while people got tired of listening to
letters of an old railroad man and his son 

lynes they had their own affairs to
attend to they set lynes down as a
chronic kicker and began to knock him

  gradually he dropped out of things
and took to criticizing the road and the
office in public

  in the meantime connolly had gone
on sticking steadily to business and obey-
ing orders when they were given regard-
less of who gave them the new man
made bad breaks but connolly always
was on hand to help him out and the
two got along pretty smoothly

  one day a better position fell vacant
and the chief clerk looking around for a
competent man thought of connolly
he was loyal to his employers

  lynes went up in the air he had a
grievance before but it was an insult
now he was as well able to take the
job as connolly indeed he thought he
could hold it down better in addition
the new man had got settled and was be-
ginning to be sharp with lynes lynes
refused to do what the new man told him
he was reported to the c c and the

c	c got him up  the carpet 

  after that lynes didnt have any use
for the road he drew his salary and
only did what he absolutely had to do

  one night he had gone off a little be-
fore closing time and was standing 
the corner waiting for a car when a
stranger asked him the way to the b and

d	building

  lynes told him how to get there and
added that it was the worst road in the
country the stranger naturally wanted
to know why and lynes began to tell
him about the awful delays on the line
the wrecks and the rotten service

  he painted such an awful picture that
he got the stranger interested inci-
dentally he let drop the fact to show
that he knew what he was talking about
that he was in the superintendents office
that settled the stranger

  an employee of the road certainly
ought to know if it was dangerous to
travel on he thanked lynes and struck
out for another route

  about a week after that a letter came
down from the general managers office
through the general superintendent to the
superintendent it created a good deal
of excitement around connollys desk
about quitting time connolly called

lynes over and handed him the letter it
read 

  about four days ago i met a mr frisbie
in new york a member of frisbie  co
big cotton exporters mr frisbie had sent
a very large shipment of cotton over the
p f r r and i asked him if he could not
give us a share of this business

  he told me that he had considered doing
so on this shipment but that he had learned
from an authoritative source that the delays
were so many  the b and d that he could
not afford to risk it on his shipments as they
invariably called for connection with steam-
ers sailing on set days

  i asked him what this source was he was
reluctant about answering but i finally got
him to state that seven days ago he had been
in baltimore on business and accidentally
met a man in the superintendents office who
gave him this information

  i challenged his statement and he said it
could be readily confirmed as the man who
had told him this was on the train reports
and thoroughly familiar with our traffic

  i suggest that action be taken to remove
so disloyal an employee in this instance his
lying statements if mr frisbie was truthful
have lost us thousands of dollars in business

  the letter was signed by the freight
traffic manager at the bottom was writ-
ten in savage strokes of a pen

  discharge this man at once notifying us
of his name-j d general manager

  for an instant everything swam before
lyness eyes he had to grip hold of the
desk to remain standing the chief clerk
looked up at him he gulped once or
twice and tried to speak but his voice
was lost it was only too evident that he
was guilty and the chief clerk knew it

  lynes got his discharge  the spot

  there wasnt a railroad man in town
who didnt hear of his disloyalty and
when he applied for work he was prompt-
ly turned down he had a wife and child
to support and things must have gone
hard with him for the year after that
there was one of depression and work
was as hard to get as green corn in winter

  it was just about ten years ago that he
came back to the b and d his hair
was gray and he was dressed like a
tramp the chief clerk had been pro-
moted right along and at the same time
connolly had gone along with him until
one was general superintendent and the
other his chief clerk

  lynes put up such a hard-luck story


the railroad mans magazine

to his old friend connolly now c c
that connolly finally managed to give
him a little odd work around the office
his wife had died of starvation and his
child-the less said of the girl the better

  then the general superintendent was
promoted to be general manager and he
took connolly along with him as chief
clerk you know them well the g
m is t f and connolly is one of your
bosses

  some fellow with pull is always being

put ahead of some fellow who thinks he
has merit

  what good is it going to do the second
man if he goes off the handle and quits
hes out of a job then and practically
has to begin all over again if hed stick
the day would come when hed be the one
man to fit in a pinch and you bet your
flues that there isnt a railroad that will
pass him up

  keep cool-and keep busy

your affectionate father

 he got his through car

although an immigration agents contract wasnt good the ohio
railroad commission helped him out

jp taft is a canadian immigration-

	agent and if he doesnt get all that
belongs to it for any party of immigrants
he happens to be conducting he wants to
know why recently he was convoying a
party from wheeling west virginia to al-
berta canada he bought through tickets
to detroit-twenty-two of them-via the
baltimore and ohio to columbus thence
on the hocking valley to detroit

  the baltimore and ohio train arrived at
columbus at  am and according to a
definite understanding mr taft had with
the company its car with the immigration
party was to be attached to the regular 
hocking valley train out of columbus but
even immigration-agents have their troubles
and this nice little program was not to be

  the hocking valley officials were very
sorry but there was a trilling consideration
in the shape of the interstate commerce
commission between their insistent patron
and their really obliging selves mr taft
had twenty-two through tickets but to get
a through car he must have twenty-five
otherwise both he and the hocking valley
would be in trouble

  that sounded formidable but it didnt
feeze mr taft he said his verbal contract
called for a through car he had in his care
several babies whose innocent young lives
should not be endangered by changing cars
at such an unearthly hour as well as an old
man whose gray hair he would not bring
down in sorrow to another car

  he would either have his car taken out on
the -s or he would rouse from their beds
the railway commissioners of the state of
ohio to give him his rights better that four
mere-railway commissioners should lose

sleep catch cold and die than that one im-
migrant a prospective citizen of canada and
the british empire should change cars

  at this the hocking valley officials bright-
ened perceptibly they told mr taft to
go ahead and do his worst to the railway
commissioners they wouldnt hinder him
so down the street went mr taft and re-
ceived the shock of his life when he found
that the railroad commissioners were al-
ready about and in fact were just prepar-
ing to take a train for dayton to transact
some official business

  the sight of such devotion to duty gave
him hope especially when he learned that
one of the commissioners mr sullivan was
newly appointed he knew that mr sulli-
van would be zealous mr sullivan was
also he proved himself to be very diplo-
matic soothing- and efficient

  he went with mr taft and in a remark-
ably short time a deputation of hocking
valley officials was on its way with money
in its pocket and charity in its heart to buy
coffee and other things for the waiting im-
migrants another deputation with mr
tafts cheerful approval was cleaning out
and preparing for their use a nice car more
comfortable than the one they had which
was to be backed up to their own car so
that they would not even have to step down
the steps to make the transfer

 it was as simple as losing money and
soon mr sullivan was departing leaving
gratitude in the hearts of mr taft the im-
migrants and the hocking valley officials
the gratitude of the latter however was
as nothing to their relief when they saw
the coach of those departing immigrants
disappear  the next train out

                fatty takes her out with bill at the
                shovel and-well let bill tell it

kill i hear you are a sure-
  enough dyed - iii - the - wool
  hero remarked the engineer
  as lie climbed into the cab a
  clean suit of overalls under
  his arm v
   i dunno about th hero end of it but
  tlieys one thing i can tell you without any-
  stutterin

   and what is that bill 

   that ive had all th excitement im
hankerin for an i dont want no more
go-rounds with train-robbers now here-
after an forevermore 

   tell me all about it old man said
the engineer seating himself comfortably
to listen  from what ive heard it was
a pretty hot-proposition all right

   say youre on th main line sure
enough hot it was so hot that i
wont need a fire t keep me warm for
some considable spell im thinkin

   y see it was this wav when you
said you was a goin to lay off las trip i
doped it out that id take a rest too  but
the hoodoo that rides straddle of my
shoulders when im awake an sits on th
bed-post while im sleepin got busy an
set me figgerin how youd only be off
one trip an how much i needed th coin
t keep up my end with sue

   of course after id rolled that dope
aroun in th sawdust up in th top of my
head for a spell i concluded t stay with
it anybody but me ud a had sense
enough to a layed off  but you can bet
your next months pay-check that if
theys any trouble closer than th moon
ill be iii th exact geographical center
of it with my hair in a braid

   when you layed off fatty burns be-

in first out on th extra-board drew th
trip for his particular prize but ill bet
forty-seven dollars against a plug of kill-
me-quick that hes busy right now wishin
it ud a been th night shift on th leaki-
est ornerest old switch-engine in the chi-
cago yards

   fattys a good enough throttle-push-
er all right an i aint got no kick on
him only he aint got no sense an hes
always buttin into trouble jus like me
two hoodoos on one measly old tub of an
engine at one time is too much its send-
in out a special invitation to trouble an
sendin it by telegraph at that

   they wasnt much happened on th
down trip excep a little fairy tried t
make a mash on me when we stopped at
gainsboro an i was so busy preventin
her that i didnt see th signal t pull out
an got a callin down from ole fuzzy
whiskers th con

   lie come trottin up th platform
puffed up like one of them bladder bal-
loons an handed me a bunch of com-
pliments that made th fairy hop up th
street with both hands over her purtv lit-
tle ears ole fuzzy can sure hand out a
bundle of red-hot language when he gets
real mad but i got even with im-be-
lieve me

  how did you do that bill in-
quired the engineer

   easy when we pulled out i leaned
out of th gangway an yelled at im to
go back an knock down a couple more
dollars an hed feel better say he
tried t bite a chunk out of th baggage-
car as it went by an he was so busy sha-
kin his fist at me that he near forgot t

get on th train

 fatty an me rubbers aroun
gazes into th muzzles of
couple of infant cannons

   well coinin back we was flirtin with
th landscape at th rate of about fifty-
five per just this side of oakley every-
thing was runnin as smooth as a new air-
pump an th trouble-train peared t be
backed clean off th map when things be-
gan to happen  an they kep on a happen-
in some more swift than this particular
coal-pusher wants t see em agin

   sue an me hadnt had a scrap for
moren a week an things was gettin so
calm an slow that i was jus sayin to
fatty i wished they would something bust
loose an stir em up an sorter make life
worth livin

   say talk about answers to your
prayers i hadnt moren got th words
out of my grub-trap when somebody yells
 hands up  an fatty an me rubbers
aroun an gazes into th muzzles of a
couple of infant cannons backed by two
plug-uglies who was roostin on th coal
back in th tank

   they didnt apear t be no absolute
necessity of havin a pencil an a pad of

paper t figure out what sort of a game
we was up against neither me or fatty
had th least idea they was a couple of
members of th salvation army or even
friends droppin in for a quiet talk

   ill swear though bad scared as i
was i nearly had to laugh when i looked
across at fatty he turned his head when
th gentle request t elevate our fingers
come an started t say  what th- 
but jus as he got half of th second word
out he caught sight of the artillery an
his face sorter froze up an there he sat
for about half a minute

   say you could a hung a couple of
towels up on his face just as easy usin
his eyes for nails

   th missionaries of peace climbed
down over th coal-gate an made their
debut into th cab pokin their armament
right up under our noses just show they
was nice civil well-disposed chaps that
wouldnt hurt nobody except by mistake

   say did you ever examine th busi-
ness end of a gun real close when it was
on the excitement special



in th hands of th enemy th hammer
drawed back an the finger of a real live
eighteen-caret dyed - in - the - wool train-
robber toyin with th trigger

    no bill i cannot say that i have
replied the engineer  did you enjoy
the experience 

   huh not sos you could notice it
that big blunderbuss kep grovvin an
swellin up till it filled th whole back end
of th cab th hole in th end of it
looked as big as a spike-keg an i could
almost see th bullet coinin out t bat me
one

    well one of em continues his dele-
cate attentions t me while th other
makes fatty shut her off an put on th
air persuadin him gentle-like by rub-
bin th business end of th howitzer agin
his neck just under his west ear

    i could see fatty didnt like th feel
of th thing any too well for he kep edg-
in away an jerkin his head forward a
little at a time like he was bowin t some
one real polite

     say says fatty pretty soon jerkin
out his watch  number eight is due at
carbondale in twenty-six minutes an we
meet her there she has right of track an
if we aint there  time shell come-

  you shut up yer talk-trap an get
this train stopped snarls-mr robber
 if you aint hankerin t be a candidate
for wings real sudden we dont care a
wormy-apple core about number eight or
anything else but th coin in that express-
car an were goin t have that-see if
number eight comes along an butts you
off th right of way after were through
thats their lookout an yours 

  gee when that blasted bulldog-
faced disgrace t th human race said that
id a been willin t a took a durn good
lickin t a pastedhim one right square
 th end of his ugly nose but th trou-
ble was hed most likely have blowed th
top of my dome off before i could a
landed  him an what good ud i be
with a tunnel through my thinkin ar-
rangements

   well when fatty got her stopped
some more of th gang that we hadnt been
favored with a call from yet uncoupled
th express-car an then they made us
pull ahead about half a mile emphasizin
th request by playfully pokin fatty in
th ribs with a baby cannon

   fatty spent his time between edgin
away from th artillery as far as he could
an swearin under his breath i couldnt
hear him but  know by th look on his
face he want reciting poetry or prac-
tisin baby-talk even if there is a new
kid jus come to his house

   when we got stopped again one of
th amateur coin-collectors lit th engine-
torch an got down  th ground his
pardner herdin fatty an me after ma-
kin me take th coal-pick along

   th express-car didnt have no door
in its front end an when we arrives at
th hind end they was two more get-rich-
quick financiers waitin for us one of
em makes th fact known real quick that
lies president of th robbin steel com-
pany

    get a move on you fellers says he
like a bulldog growlin  whatcl you
think this is anyhow-a funeral or a
pink tea

    hev you inside th car  he yells
 th engineers goin t bust in th door of
your old cracker-box you can shoot all
y want to but y wont hit -nobody but
him all of which must a been mighty
interestin news t burns an th man in-
side th car im thinkin

  well th feller grabs th coal-pick
an gives it t fatty an he steps up real
prompt as if he was goin t obey orders
like a little lamb

   they aint no platform  them cars
you know an a man could stan right on
th ties an paste the lock of th door

   fatty raises th pick t hand th door
one but instead of doin it he whirls
an aims at th chief of th financiers

   th feller dodged an he missed im
slick an clean an durn near busted th
head of th pick off th handle when it
come down on th rail it was a fool
thing t do for even if hed a laid out
th one he aimed at they was three more
of em with guns in their fists an him
with a coal-pick an me with nothin but
my finger-nails t fight with

  say they was three pistol-butts
made connection with fattys dome be-
fore th pick hit th ground an he
dropped like a ten-wlieeler fell on him
i sure thought they had put out his head-
light for good

   it took em jus three-fifths of a sec-
ond t present me with th coal-pick an


the railroad mans magazine

my runnin orders an you bet your pilot
i got busy every one of them had a
gatlin gun in each hand ah they was all 
pointed right square at your humble fire-
man

  say id a looked like a colander
if theyd a gone off i was scared mad
an feelin bad about fatty an between
th three i was earryin abouj all th pres-
sure im guaranteed for

  it took jus three licks t bust th
lock of th door an with th last one
the head of th pick broke off leavin
most of th handle in my hands i
jumped back as th door swung open
thinkin th messenger might accidentally
send a few bunches of lead through an

i didnt make no mistake he sure lost
no time in openin up with his heavy ar-
tillery

   it didnt do him no good though for

one of th robbers pitched something in at
th door an they was a flash an a explo
sion like th boiler of th engine had let
loose an then things was all calm an
peaceful inside th car

 three of th bandits climbed in leav-
in one with me so i wouldnt get lone-
some they hadnt no more than got
in when one of em lets a yell outof
him an my man rubbers in th
door to see whats doin

    say i had th
  handle of that pick
  in my fist yet an
  i jus handed th
  gentleman a tap on
  th dome with th
  butt-end of it an
  sprinted for th en-
  gine ill bet th
  dirt from my shoes
  went clear over th
  express-car an i
  guess i hit th
  ground three times
  between th back
  end of th car and
  the gangway

      she hacl a big
fire in when fatty
shut her off at th
request of our
friends an she
was still pippint
beat th band i
chucked th lever
down in th corner
opened th sand
an pulled her wide
open she never slipped a turn an th
way she yanked that express-car ahead
was a sight

    i hustled a fire into her an by that
time she was sendin th skyrockets a
hundred feet above th stack an things
was beginnin t hum

   as near as i could guess we was
nine miles from carbondale an i had
jus seven minutes to make it an you
bet i was doin some tall guessin long
about that time of th nighf

   ill bet there was a surprised lot of
men back in the- express-car remarked
the engineer

   yep they sure was the messenger
told me all about it when i went out to
tli hospital to see him to-day it was a
on the excitement special



dynamite cartridge th whelps threw in
th door an it knocked him silly besides
breaking one of his wings

  wings bill

  arm mr innocence a-r-m arm
its a wonder you dont have t have a
map t get over th road with

   as i was savin it knocked im out
for a minute an broke an arm an when
he got back  th track th three captains
o finance was in th car all ready for
business an had impounded his gun for
a starter

   when i got t th engine an yanked
er open he says it jerked th whole outfit
off their feet an rolled em in a heap
by th time they got up an made up their
minds what had hit em we was goin so
fast they couldnt get off

   they was jus wild he said an one
of em leaned out of each side door an
begun t bombard th engine while th
other one-th chief-chopped a hole in
th front end of th car they was a lot
of iron rods though an he couldnt make
it big enough t crawl through but by
gettin up close t th top he could see over
th tank into th cab an pump bullets
into it

   i had her hooked up in six inches an
th throttle wide open an whats more

she stayed that way until we sighted ar-
bondale

   run say a streak o lightning with
a tin can tied t its tail wouldnt a been
in it with us

   i was leanin out of your window
wonderin whether id be a fireman or an
angel in five minutes more when bing
something took a chunk out of th cab
an lookin back i saw one of th ex-
press-car passengers leanin out of th side
door aimin his cannon right at me an
swearin like a pirate

   i jumped over t th other side an th
same identical performance was bein
pulled off there too i didnt lean out of
 more windows you hear me willie
kep right in th exact mathematical cen-
ter of th deck you bet

   why didnt you stop and go ahead
and flag number eight asked the engi-
neer

   huh how long d you reckon id
a lasted if id a stopped this old tub
an a give them gents a chance t get at
me they want puttin in any of their
time lovin me jus then mind you
properly abashed the engineer sub-
sided  you are right bill go ahead
with the story

   betcher life im right an whats

  more im alive an thats a durn sight
  moren id a been if-id a pulled off
  any fool stunts like that th old girl was
  beginnin t take th curves runnin most-
  ly on one side an i could see th roof of
  th express-car wabblin aroun like it was
  crazy i was jus goin t ease her off a
  little when bingf something hit th boiler-
  head beside me an lookin aroun i saw
  a hole in th front end of th car near th
  roof an one of them blunderbusses
  spoutin fire an lead like a volcano gone
  crazy

   willie took one look an dropped
 down behind th coal-gate out o range
 i didnt dast to raise up after that an
 had t put in th fires on my hands an
 knees

    getting pretty warm wasnt it bill

     well they did pear t be some set on
  gettin willies goat an thats a fact
  cheer up though th worst is yet t come

    th infernal chump kept pumpin
 lead into tli cab an pretty soon one of
 his bullets broke th water-glass an then
 vou bet i said my  now i lay me she
 was a jumpin around th curves like a
 circus-horse in a ring th coal rattlin
 down through th coal-gate until it was
 clear out on th deck th cab full of
  steam an boilin water an th landscape
 what little i could see of it through th
 gangway goin by in a solid streak an
 th bullets pingin th boilerhead an cab

     oh it was a red-lemonade picnic all
  right all right but willie aint lookin
  for any more of em real soon

      id got her goin all right an she was
  sure goin some too  but supposin she
  stuck to th rails until we got to carbon-
  dale hocc in thunder was i goint get her
  stopped

     th apostle of peace was keepin th
  air full of bullets an if i raised up t
  shut er off an put  th air id stan a
  fine large fat juicy chance of stoppin a
  pound or so of lead which might upset
  my digestive machinery

      then to add to th pleasure of th
  occasion th steam from th busted wa-
  ter-glass filled th cab so i couldnt see a
  thing or even see enough outside t tell
  where we was though judgin by th
  speed i was calculatin we ought t be at
  least half-way across th united states

     i couldnt even see my watch an
 was jus beginnint hold my breath wait-

 in for th smash when we met number
 eight an was wonderin how it ud feel
 t be ground up into sausage when one of
 the blitherin robbers did th only decent
 stunt they pulled off all through th mess
 he busted out th glass in the front cab-
 window on your side with one of his lead
 pills th steam blowed out of that side
 of th cab of course an give me a chance
 t do something they was a piece of
 bell-corcl behind your seat-box an keep-
 in down low out o range of th bom-
 bardment i got it out an made a slip-
 noose on one end

   then i took a chance an raised up
an slipped it on th whistle-lever an
pulled th thing wide open i tied th
other end of ith rope t th coal-gate

    say th net results was sure a peach
as th tank ud bob up an down it ud
wabble th whistle-lever along with it
th durnd thing sounded like a steam
calliope gone plum ravin crazy

  just as i got that done i seen th
carbondale mile-board go by like a ball
out of a cannon it was then sure up t
me t do something real sudden unless
i wanted t introduce myself an a lot of
other folks t th hereafter in a minute

   th bullets was still a plumpin in
i guess that robber chap ud gone clean
batty an didnt know a thing but trigger-
pullin reachin up with th coal-pick
handle i managed t get th throtttle
shoved in  an after pluggin at th air-
handle with lumps o coal i hit it a smash
an knocked it clear round to emergency

   pretty soon they was a slappity bang
smash-an  she rolled over t one side
like she was goint turn over at least half
a dozen times afore i knowed what had
happened she was standin still as a pet
lamb an folks was crowdin into th cab
an askin questions at th rate of fifty-
two to th second

   y see number eight happened t
have a passenger for carbondale an for
th first time in a month stopped at that
town just as they was pullin out th
eagle eye caught a glimpse of my head-
light an heard th tune th tank was
playin on th whistle

   he spicioned they was something
unusual cornin off an had sense enough
t stop again an have his fireman skip
down an throw th switch for th side-
track-an he didnt do it a second too
on the excitement special



i managed t get th
throttle shoved in

soon either we stopped right opposite
th last car of number eight

   th express - car passengers after
pausin t say a short prayer for th re-
pose of my soul skipped of course but

 fatty want hurt much only three
dents in his dome that th sawbones saysll
get well all right th feller i paid my
compliments to with th pick-handle was
still peacefully sleepin when we got back
t th train an th sheriff gathered him
in an-there you are

    its time we was gettin this old mill
ready for some slower runnin than that
she done last trip im thinkin

th sheriff got em afore daylight an th
coin was safe all right all right mebby
th express companyll come in with a
check for ten dollars after a while

in the smoking compartment while
his wife had been permitted to sit alone at

sauntered back and sat down beside the lady
saying that he wished the first call for lunch
might soon be given

  then he noticed that his wife was con-
cealing something between herself and the
side of the car

   what have you got there   he asked

   sh-sh she replied looking around to
assure herself that she would not be over-
heard its a book the news-agent came
through a little while ago and he had this
hidden under a lot of other things i dont
know why he thought he could trust his
secret with me but he did we must not
betray him

 let me see it

 no we mustnt show it here somebody
 might notice it and the boy would get into
 trouble

  he told you the railroad company had
 given orders that no more copies of it were
 to be sold on the train didnt he

  yes

  and said it was terribly sensational  
 yes its a story we must be careful not
 to leave around where the children can get
 hold of it

  it was the last copy of the book he had
 too wasnt it

 yes how do you happen to know so
much about it

  well in sprinkling these cinders along
the right of way one work-train was
needed filling cars at the pit three crews
were used in hauling the loads to the
stretch of track being improved and the
fifth crew operated the cinder-plow and
the unloading

  of course after having had six
months of nerve-twisting excitement in
hulbrook i was highly elated when
one night about four in the morning
the call-boy informed me that i was
 it  for an extra west

  he cheerfully volunteered the pleas-
ant information that we were going
outto relieve the crew which had been
serving a two-weeks sentence unload-
ing cinders

  at that particular time the unload-
ing was going on along a stretch
of track where a man was once
seen standing by the right-of-
way  but that was a long time
ago and you couldnt bank on

  there wasnt even an operator for the
unloading crew always carried an oper-

made me feel a little better when i came

and then he would go out and flirt with
the switch-stand

joe learned his over
on the denver and
rio grande and when
it c a m e to shuffling
the cars tying them
down by hand put-
ting in a bras s or
chaining them together joe was there like
a whistle he had worked as an operator
for several years been a conductor several
times and i think he was trainmaster
once on the squedunk central or some
other jerk-water pike

  he was sure an old head best-natured
fellow you ever saw and  guess almost

the cliff-dwellers must have had
a big flat on bill williamss
mountain


the railroad mans magazine

couldnt have found a better fellow to put
him next

  almost was jubilant but eighteen hours
later it was different

when grit meets grit

  plowing cinders off a string of flats all
day with the heat registering  in the
shade-minus the shade-switching the
empties in on a siding and the loads out
comes as near being a picnic as an arizona
cactus does a mattress just the same it
was the makin of the pup and after the
first day out almost knew the difference
between a go-ahead and a stop-sign

  in railroading every day is just like
every other day with something different
we put in a week unloading cinders until
the whole crew looked like cinders before
we were finally ordered over to the cinder
pit

  at the cinder pit a fellow could get a
real meal and something which resembled
a bath the next week we went to haul-
ing to and from the pit and for almost
at least things began to grow exciting

  the first evening we were making a late
haul so that the unloading crew would
have something to do the first thing in the
morning we were dropping down a
mountain grade a few minutes ahead of a
passenger-train and if everything had
gone all right we would have been all to
the good

almosts assignment

  they hadnt more than started to roll
well when one of those mountain showers
set in and about the same time the bog-
head began to bellow for brakes that
grade is forty-one miles long and going
down there is but one place where a car
-wont start of its own weight

  of course magirl got awful busy with
a club and knowing that climbing from
one cinder flat to another was no work for
a student i left almost in the caboose
with instructions to look out for the head-
light of the passenger-train following us
and if they showed up to drop a fusee

  then i went out to see what i could do
at twisting a few they had a good start
and our only hope was to tie them down
when they hit the one hog-back about
ten miles on

  we hadnt gone a mile before the re-
flection of the headlight from the pas-
senger-engine began to show behind us
and when i looked back there were at
least three fusees lying back along the
track sputtering merrily

  we had dropped down another mile
and the passenger was showing up ten
miles back at the bead of the grade and
if there were any more red lights in the
caboose it was because almost couldnt
find them a string of red-fire that would
have been a winning feature in a fourth
of j uly celebration in any city was staked
out behind us

private fireworks

  its an even bet that when the eagle eye
tipped over the grade and saw that string
of red-fire staring him in the face he put
the trunks in the front end of the baggage-
car i couldnt go back over a dozen cars
of cinders and tell the boy to quit dishing
out the celebration for i was mighty busy
right where i was

  when we hit the hog-back it was as
plain as the nose on your face that the
cars were not going to stop i knew that
we would be some more busy before we
got to falstuf at the bottom of the grade

  they were all tied down as tight as one
man could tie them in fact i had begun
to fear that a wheel would heat and break
and we would save any one the trouble of
unloading that bunch of cinders

  i climbed over to a side stake and
leaned out just as we hit the hog-back and
looked back toward the caboose i saw
the prettiest exhibition of fireworks i ever
witnessed first i saw a white and red
light in the caboose door then they shot
out toward the ground and then they shot
up again in a beautiful semicircle and all
was darkness

devotion to duty

  almosts idea was fine but his exe-
cution was poor that headlight behind
him kept getting bigger and bigger until
he decided that it was time to drop off
an flag he dropped

  he not only dropped but he rolled-
about twenty feet down a cinder-bank
and into the only mud-hole along the
whole system he told me afterward that
the evolution of almost

he couldnt find his lanterns after he made
the slide but before severing his connec-
tions with the caboose he had loaded him-
self down with fusees and torpedoes

  old jim evans was pulling the pas-
senger regular no  that night loafing
along right on the schedule until he
caught up with that crop of fusees we
made falstuf all rigkt except that there
wasnt a wheel on the train byf
what would have fried eggs and
were in the clear a good ten min-
utes before evans brought no

	to a stop with the engine op-
posite my caboose and rost jen
minutes telling ine about it

  jim was one of those fellows
who took living as a part of life

nothing ever upset his good-
nature

  of course i fully expected
him to hand almost down
from the cab a total wreck but
instead almost climbed down
from the deck alone while jim
looked down with his perpetual
grin at first i didnt realize
that it was almost

  he had all of the southwest
quarter of the northeast half of
the east section of range ten of
the state of arizona wrapped
about him he had enough cin-
ders mixed in to ballast the new
york central from end to end
and beginning at his revolver-
pocket and ending just above
his hock-joint there was a great
deal of nothing in the way of
clothing

   he looked as if hed gone to a
finish eatch-as-catch-can with a
buzz-saw i held my lantern up so
that the light revealed the details the grin
was about the only thing i recognized

   he almost got into us remarked al-
most by way of breaking the silence

scaring the passengers

   almost  echoed jim with a chuckle
  was five miles behind you when i
tipped the grade and your tail lights were
the biggest thing this side the grand
canon if id been blind and deaf and
dumb i couldnt a got by the fireworks
and the dynamite

   when we hit deweys fleet back there
ill bet every passenger on the train hid
his money reckon everybody in the
sleeps in an upper berth wonder the
whole train wasnt blowed to kingdom
come

   i guess there haint no danger of any
one hitting that dog-house of yourn as
long as youve got that lookin out for it

well so long fellows glad no ones
hurt

    all in a lifetime have to drag them
along a bit now or the old manll want
to know if the s got the rheumatics
when we went over the train we found
that the air had not been cut in behind
the engine almost learned right there
one lesson that i know of

  about midnight we tied up cold and
tired and i guess almost more than that
after i had turned in i heard almost and
magirl talking out in their end of the
caboose

if there were any more red lights it was because
almost couldnt find them


the railroad mans magazine

into the only mud-hole
along the whole
system

  hurt you any asked magirl
-have i hurt you any

  not a bit answered almost and
then after a pause say joe ill have
to go back there to-morrow

  what for from joe who showed
signs of a lack of interest

   i lost my badge and the rule-book
say-

   oh fergit it  replied joe and the
next noise sounded like a snore

  but every trip did not prove so strenu-
ous for almost of course there were
those little times of pleasure when he had
to drag a chain or put in a few brasses
there were times when cars took to the
country and we had to carry the frogs
from the engine

almosts little jaunt

  and then there was the time that al-
most and three loads drifted down the
far side of the mountain down through
the tunnel four miles of canon track
over the big trestle through fairfield so
fast that the operator reported that  one
car just went by here clear down to the
forks where the flight was suddenly
stopped by an open switch and when they

picked him out from the cinders he was
still insisting that he  almost had em
stopped when they left the rail but such
trivial matters didnt touch him

in fact we had only been off the work-
train a couple of months doing our lap
in chain-gang with nothing more exci-
ting than fighting an occasional fire un-
til i noticed that almost was
growing pensive he looked
sick and i suggested that he
lay off for a few days and run
down to hulbrook

   fie did and when he came
   back he cornered me in the
   caboose and asked

    do you reckon ill ever
   earn the right to sign the or-
   ders 

    you sure will i replied
    if you hang around long
   enough	

   well i tell you mr
thomas and that grin came
into view again  mag-miss
mahorney-says as how she
thinks id be better satisfied
if i was an engineer with wheels to work
with and i guess ill try to get on a
firin the goat until theyll let me out on
the road

  now almost never debated matters
much andwhen he  guessed  he gen-
erally made the guess good and he never
went back to my dog-house after that
lay-off naturally he went out of my
line of vision somewhat but i saw him
every now and then leaning out of the
cab-window of the switch-engine and if
the way he was ringing the bell was an
indication he was perfectly happy

   business got good for yours truly and
with enough seniority behind me i saw
some pretty soft jobs on the division so
i scratched my feet when they itched
and kept making the mileage and pulling
down the pay-check  it seemed like the
longer i worked the better i liked it and
every now and then when i walked over
to the engine i would find almost swing-
ing the scoop

a coming man

   gradually i began to take notice of the
gossip at the terminal they said that if
there was one guy on the pike who could
the evolution of almost



keep the needle on the mark it was that
freckle-faced narrow-gaged grinnin and
a few other things almost

  they said he could calk a flue or set
up a wedge or put in a lubricating glass
or anything else around one of those junk
piles just as good as any hog-head on the
pike and of course i didnt say much
but i took a lot of credit for it

  if columbus hadnt discovered am-
erica of course we would all be living
some place-else and if i hadnt discovered
almost he would still have been holding
up the corner of the box-car station at
hutbrook

  its funny how time--flies you drift
intoa town and go to work sleep a lit-
tle eat a little and work a lot and wake
up to find that youve  been hanging
around f-our or five years

  i had bucked the extra board played
the chain-gang and finally drew a blue
suit of clothes and a string of band wag-
ons before i realized i had been riding
up and down that pike for five years

  i dont know how the time seemed to
almost but as ive been forced to re-
mark several times when he started

the

something he generally was in at the fin-
ish one night the call-boy tried to knock
the door off the hinges calling me for
special east soon as possible

   after i had decided that it would be
impolite to break the wash-bowl over the
kids head after i had signed the finger-
marked book and noted that there was no
engine marked up after i had yelled to
him and asked who the engineer was and
he replied

    dont know yet first fellow i can
git maybe almost benson i say after
that i realized that almost had set out
about five years before to earn the right
to sign orders and i made a mental note
of the fact that he had  almost  arrived

   since that night ive had him on the
head-end a good many times and im in-
clined to believe that maggie mahorneys
advice was good although there is a
chance that there was an element in it
which almost did not recognize at the
time for since almost has a regular
engine uncle sam has a new postmaster
at hulbrook and maggie told me her-
self that one night the new engineer al-
most proposed and she did the rest
end

and yet our railroads grow

in  the railways of the united states
had a capital of  which is
almost equal in-value to the countrys entire
property at the time of lincolns election

  their gross earnings for a single year
 are nearly three times as great
as the whole of the interest-bearing debt of
the national government

  the  persons  the pay-rolls of
the railways of the united states represent
a larger force than were under grant lee
and the rest of the union and confederate
commanders at appomattox they are a
bigger army than japan and russia com-
bined had in manchuria when in 
president roosevelt brought about the peace
at portsmouth

  the wealth of american railroads equals

the total wealth of all the southern states
or belgium holland and switzerland com-
bined

  more money will be spent in  in this
country on cross-ties than england and ger-
many will spend on war-ships

  more wealth in coal will be consumed in
locomotives than the worlds naval powers
will spend on war-ships-england france
germany russia japan and the united
states

  the locomotives will cost more than the
maintenance of the english army

  the material-mostly from the steel mills
-will cost the railroads more than all eu-
rope will spend on armies and navies

chapter ix
landing a good one

   she situation was more pleas-
ant fro  the combines
millm standpoint in view of the
ffp i  very excellent report which
 -ltijv the two rival newspapers
had of the proceedings at
the franchise club after a long and
heated discussion at the combine it was
concluded that both leigh and allen had
emissaries whose identity was unknown
but who nevertheless knew what news
really is

  burke was furious and very broadly
hinted to the reporters that if that kind
of thing was to continue he personally
failed to see the use of a combine at all
the reporters knowing that mr burke
was not in the habit of hinting use-
lessly in regard to his intentions felt
correspondingly uncomfortable not only

	account of the possible loss of the
 snap  that they were enjoying but
knowing too that the  boss  was quite
capable of blacklisting them in the event
of his believing that they had not done
their alleged duty by him

   early that evening allen called at the
fifth precinct station-house maloney was
again at the desk the reporter being a
man of direct methods said

    and so sergeant ou did your best
last night to have me  scooped  

   what dye mean  growled the man
behind the railings

 exactly what i say you kept the
matter about the church riot from me
 twarnt on the blotter snarled the
sergeant  and im only supposed to give
you fellers whats on the blotter

began in the march railroad man

     then why did you give it to halstead
 and some other of that crowd 

    look here said the sergeant  i
 aint responsible to you for what i do
 and what i dont do you do your busi-
 ness and then get out see but dont
 you come cross-examining me cause i
 wont stand for it who are you any-
 how 

   allen smiled sweetly and in a manner
 that would have made a less obtuse per-
 son than the sergeant feel uncomfortable

    who am i  he said  well- you
 know who i am but sergeant nobody
 would ever dream who you were when
 they see you on the speedway behind that
 mare of yours

   with a nod he departed

   two days later there appeared in the
 clarion an article headed  a thrifty
 police sergeant it told of malofreys
 life his real-estate holdings the approxi-
 mate value of his personal property a
 description of his two horses and a de-
 tailed account of the sixteen charges upon
 which he had been tried during his pro-
 fessional career

    the article furthermore laid stress on
 the fact that the sergeants luxuries and
 holdings were all due to his extreme econ-
 omy inasmuch as there were no tangible
 proofs of his having earned a penny out-
 side of his income as a member of the
 uniformed force

    there was also a figured estimate of the
 value of his estate in general by which
 it was proven that he must have saved
 at the rate of about four thousand dol-
 lars a year out of an average yearly in-
 come of one thousand two hundred dol-
 lars

   then there were pictures of maloney
maloneys houses maloneys horses and
s magazine single copies  cents
breaking the combine	

rigs maloney in uniform maloney as
seen at the race-track and maloney in his
driving costume

  leigh laughed when he read the article
 you are setting the pace for me are you
jimmie said he well ill see if i
cant go you one better

  he followed up the attack on maloney
with more details of that unhappy officers
career

  the next two days passed in a some-
what uneventful fashion on the morn-
ing of the third day while leigh was in
court ahearne quietly slipped a note in
his hand it was to the effect that he
would be at the office over the drug-store
at about seven oclock

  the big irishman was on time and this
is what he told the reporter

  that before court had opened three
of the parishioners of father podinski
had called in order to obtain a warrant
for the latters arrest on charges of fe-
lonjous assault scott the warrant-clerk
and a protege of burke had taken them
into a corner and as ahearne had over-
heard told them to come back at four
oclock when he would see that the war-
rants were ready

  he also warned them not to talk to the
newspaper men ahearne smelling a rat
had subsequently watched scott and saw
him despatch a note to the municipal aft-
er the court had adjourned at one oclock
from this he inferred that another at-
tempt was being made to freeze leigh
out

   but when did the judge sign the war-
rants  asked leigh

  ahearne replied that not infrequently
a number of warrants were signed in
blank it being left to the discretion of
the clerk to fill them up in the event of
their being needed

  if that is so said leigh  when do
you think that the warrants will be
served  

   some time this evening replied
ahearne

   do you know any of the complain-
ants pat  

  wan he keep a shoe - store on
saunders street his name i dont know
because i cant pronounce it but i know
him by sight anyhow

   i tell you what pat can you spare
the time to go with me to-night to the

priests house and if he is out well hunt
up your friend the shoemaker the rea-
son that i ask you to go is that perhaps
the shoemaker might suspect that im a
newspaper man and wouldnt talk where-
as he would certainly respect such a fine-
looking cop

  ahearne chuckled

   so the couple set out that evening and
found that the priest was away from
home from the shoemaker they learned
that he had been arrested and taken to a
magistrates house and bailed

  where is he now asked ahearne
quickly

   the little pole looked at his questioner
with twinkling eyes and replied that he
 did not know

   then said ahearne tapping his
shield  youll come along with me and
find him and he scowled ferociously

  at this the shoemaker weakened and
confessed that the priest had been bailed
out by the proud author of a couple of
tiny new additions to the polack settle-
ment who had counted on a christening
that night and that he was even then en-
gaged in assisting in the celebration

   so he was found and being in a jovial
humor gave leigh a capital story with
 frills as ahearne remarked in fact
it practically  scooped  the combine

chapter x

buckling on armor

teigh was leaving court the next day
when halstead stopped him

    leigh said he  can i come and see
you at your office this evening 

   why certainly anything of a spe-
cial nature

    yes but ill talk to you when i see
you

   leigh felt that somehow or other hal-
steads request was connected with the
podinski matter but he was hardly pre-
pared for the actual event

  halstead kept the engagement and he
talked briefly but to the point he had
in regard to the franchise club story
been practically accused by jennison and
the others of  peaching and when the
podinski story appeared in the clarion
and the sentinel he was told in emphat-
ic language that lie was the leak
	 the railroad mans magazine

   at this he lost liis temper and declared
his intention of quitting the combine

  would leigh let him join forces with
him and allen

  is this straight halstead said
leigh looking at him searchingly

    i may liave my little vices billy but
i dont think that lyingis one of them
was the reply

   settled responded leigh  glad
to have you but we dont play poker re-
member

  and the two men shook hands

  allen laughed uproariously when he
heard the news and prophesied more de-
fections from the ranks of the combine
within the week

   i think said leigh that evening
 that well nexf attend to our friend the
clerk of the seventeenth court theres
nothing like nipping these little conspira-
cies in the bud

   but how  asked allen

  leigh explained that the presiding
magistrate was a very close friend of the
lieutenant-governor of the state the
lieutenant-governor was literally an old
college chum of mr bevins for from
alma mater days they had been more or
less intimately connected socially and po-
litically

  if mr bevins would suggest to the
lieutenant-governor the advisability of
calling the magistrates attention to the
misuse actual and possible on the part
of the court clerk of warrants signed in
blank and explain why the issuance of
such instruments would be stopped

   and added leigh  mr clerk will
be duly informed by me of the why and
wherefore of his calling down

  leigh kept his word and things hap-
ened as he had prognosticated but that
did not prevent him and his associates
from making caustic references to the
clerks action when the priest was ar-
raigned

  the judge dismissed the priest on his
own recognizances and it went abroad in
the court that it wasnt well to try to
scoop billy leigh and his friends

  this was hitting the combine another
blow

  there was a disposition on the part of
certain of the highburg hospitals to dis-
criminate in the matter of news in favor
of the combine

  leigh remembered that a man in the
press-room of the record who had met
with an accident had been treated at one
of these institutions

  on his return to work he had com-
plained of the food sanitary arrange-
ments and methods of some of the doc-
tors and nurses in the hospital leigh
got the man to make a sworn statement
embodying his grievances the next time
that the hospital showed a disposition to
hold back information the reporter
 sprung  the ex-patients statement on
the superintendent intimating that on the
basis of it and similar documents he pro-
posed to call for a searching investiga-
tion

  the superintendent a pompous pan-
icky little man was badly frightened

  you see said leigh artlessly you
wont give us any of the news of this
place so were going to make some news
about it

  the superintendent took the hint ea-
gerly from thence on the trio were
kept very well informed about hospital
doings in highburg

    i dont like this business of flourish-
ing a club over the heads of people said
leigh when discussing the affair with
staynes  but public news belongs to
the public and when a man or institution
tries to keep it back from the public there
is only one thing to do-crack him on the
knuckles

  the combine began to settle back into
its old ways its spasm of energy was
followed by a reaction the attitude of
the combine was this

  leigh seemed to be getting the news in
spite of its unwonted activity so what
was the use of working anyhow the
election was coming on and in the face
of it and the recent action of the  big
man the newspapers of the combine
would hardly dare to discharge its mem-
bers

  besides that the indications were that
burke and his following would surely suc-
ceed themselves hence the combine
would continue to let leigh and the others
sweat	

  the combine would remain the com-
bine with its game its rum its free quar-
ters and its  bit  when it dutifully held
its tongue or opened its mouth

  the one exception to the prevailing or-
breaking the combine



der of things was found in the seventh
precinct in which captain hendrix held
sway one of the sergeants being his son-
in-law

  hendrix was an old-time policeman
retaining many of the unpleasant features
of the days when the man in uniform
was usually a bully armed with a curse
and a club

  he was in the station-house when leigh
and allen visited it that evening and re-
turned their salutation with something
that might be either a response a snarl
or a growl

  there was a rumor of an elopement in
the precinct allen turned to the cap-
tain and asked him if he knew anything
about it

   its none of your business if i do
said the commander  i aint here to
earn your salary for you by sneaking on
other people

   quite right captain said allen
cheerfully  of course not what goes
on in your precinct is your business and
nobody elses-not even the publics-
unless the newspapers make it so

  what dye mean said the captain

  allen turned to leigh leigh shook
his head and the pair departed leaving
hendrix looking uncomfortable and mys-
tified

   why those words  said leigh when
they were outside

   dunno replied allen  i simply
wanted to throw a little  con  into the
cap

    from small events these huge events
arise  quoted leigh after some medita-
tion  youve laid the train for an ex-
plosion jimmie you have induced
thoughts dont ask me what it is just
now ill tell you to-morrow

  to-morrow came and leigh spent what
hours he could spare in certain municipal
offices fie held earnest conversations with
certain officials of his acquaintance he
took copious notes from official tomes and
that evening he addressed allen thus

   im going to visit harrow street ca-
sino to-night will you come along jim-
mie 

  anything in the wind asked the
other

   very much was the reply  and
im going to take this along so say-
ing he opened a drawer in his desk pro-

duced a revolver and slipped it into his
hip-pocket

  allen looked on with anticipation

   guess id better carry a gun too
said allen

    it xjpuld be wise replied leigh

chapter xj

leigh and allen cornered

nr he harrow street casino was situ-
ated in the heart of highburg on
a short side - street the termination of
which connected two of the busiest thor-
oughfares in the borough

  the casino itself was a four-story
brick structure of somewhat shabby exte-
rior but roomy within on the ground
floor was a barroom at the rear of which
were a number of billiard-tables on
the second floor was yet another barroom
and a big apartment for dancing on the
third floor was a small theater and yet an-
other bar

  here the auditorium was so arranged
that the seats could be removed in short
order-as they were every night after the
stage performance-a dance following

  on the fourth floor were a dozen or so
of small rooms in each of which so ru-
mor had it were continuous card-games
of all sorts and descriptions

  the casino had a most unsavory repu-
tation robberies without number and
two or three fatal stabbing and shooting
affrays were recorded against it since
burke obtained power in highburg how-
ever the casino had been left severely
alone by the authorities and was running
in full blast a disgrace to the community
its manager was a man named neil-a
big burly fellow who had graduated from
the tenderloin of new york as a keeper
and manager of dives

  a corps of bouncers trained by him-
self was a feature of the casino

  on their way to the place leigh ex-
plained that the object of his current visit
was to look the place over in order to ob-
tain preliminary data for an expose he
said that allens little bout with captain
hendrix had reminded him that some
months before it had been rumored that-
the captain was the virtual owner of the
building

  leighs investigation in certain of the


the railroad mans magazine

municipal departments and private infor-
mation which had reached him had prov-
en that hendrix had tried to cover his
connection with the place by a series of
first and second mortgages and transfers
but that nevertheless he leigh had es-
tablished the fact of ownership

  but why the guns asked allen
tapping his hip-pocket as he neared the
place

   well said leigh  neil knows me
-to his sorrow when he first came over
here-perhaps you have forgotten the
story-i showed him up in good shape

   his record was not exactly of the na-
ture that a man cares to see in cold type
and he swore to do all kinds of things to
me

   on two or three occasions when i
ran up against him he has shown an ugly
disposition he and his bouncers are a
pretty tough lot

   while i do not believe in guns yet
guns have their uses they are like ton-
ics-they act as preventatives sometimes

   neil will know that i have got an ob-
ject in coming to his place and should he
cut up about it it is possible that we will
get a story that will be outside the hen-
drix question

  the two reporters passed unnoticed
and unrecognized into the auditorium of
the theater the floor space was taken
up by seats arranged around little tables
there being a quartet of chairs at each

  two of the chairs facing the stage were
taken possession of by the visitors
they ordered cigars and apparently fixed
their attention on the  artists while in
reality they were taking in their sur-
roundings

  the place was fairly well crowded and
the waiters were busy the reporters had
to wait some little time for their orders
to be filled and in the interval a young
rather pretty blonde sitting at the table
immediately in front of them tried to call
their attention to the fact that she was
thirsty

  suddenly her smiles disappeared and
in their place came a sudden look of
alarm

  as she was looking directly at them
leigh knew that some one just behind
must have been responsible for the change
in her demeanor

  in a moment he turned carelessly and

saw at another table neil and alderman
schmidt the former scowled and spat
as the reporter looked at him

  leigh quietly reported the matter to
allen whose face brightened

  jolly place for a scrap jimmie he
murmured  these chairs will come in
mighty handy

  the reporters order was not filled
and leigh knew full well what that meant
-a remonstrance was thereby invited
which by means thoroughly understood
by dive-keepers could be easily developed
into a fight

  leigh suggested to allen that they take
their departure outside of the theater
floor somebody tapped leigh from be-
hind

  it was alderman schmidt

  what are you doing here he said
insolently

  leigh replied that it was none of his
business whereupon schmidt expressed
his opinion of newspaper men in gen-
eral and of leigh in particular in a tone
that brought a number of persons to the
landing including several whom leigh
recognized as neils rough-and-ready
bouncers

   get your back against the wall bil-
ly whispered allen  dont let them get
behind us and get as near the stairs as
you can

  have you anything more to say
said leigh as schmidt paused for breath
 because if you havent we would be glad
to know it i am busy and want to get
away

  neil thrust himself forward

   well you wont go away as you came
in said he

  and why replied leigh

   because im going to smash-

  allen interrupted

   i would like to remark friend neil
that youre not in your sixtli avenue dive
just now and so if you put a hand on
my friend or myself-you or any of your
heelers-ill make a hole in you that you
wont mend with a needle and thread in
six months 

  he whipped the revolver from his pock-
et neil checked himself suddenly

  why you- he began but before
he could go further leighs revolver had
been produced and was handed to his
companion
breaking the combine



  jimmie said he keep that crowd
covered and now mr neil and mr
schmidt here is my note-book and here is
my pencil talk away as hard as you
please im going to report you at length
the battle-fire was in allens eyes and
there was no movement forward the
manager and the alderman stung by the
laughter of the crowd availed themselves
of the invitation issued by leigh and for
ten minutes poured forth a turbulent flood
of picturesque language in which they
said everything possible that could be said
in a profane way about the press

   iliank you said leigh cordially
 im greatly obliged to you but you
really must excuse us-we have other en-
gagements

  he and allen backed down-stairs the
little wicked black noses of the revolvers
pointing upward as they did so

    well said allen as they got outside
 we got our story and it was hotter stuff
than we had looked for but it wont spoil
your future story will it 

   no said leigh reflectively  it
wont but in my story to-morrow morn-
ing i shall tell of hendrixs connection
with the place and of course shall give
you and halstead all that which i have
learned in that connection

  so the word went round highburg
that the trio had knives in store for those
who sought to bring confusion to their
faces hendrix and maloney and their
associates wondered what would happen
next

  they did not have to wonder long
for the very next day there appeared in
the three papers more about the harrow
street resort and the day following the
sentinel put on foot a petition to the
mayor of martport to close the casino

  burke was more wrought up over the
matter than he cared to confess astute
and unscrupulous as he was he knew the
power and product of aroused public opin-
ion

  criticism he looked for in the news-
papers but between that and specific and
organized attacks on institutions with
-which he was identified was a totally dif-
ferent matter

  he knew too that men of his caliber
were only possible and safe so long as the
average citizen wasnt aroused he was
 sore  with the men responsible for the

rumpus and hendrix and maloney got a
picturesque calling down

   some of you stiffs in uniform said
the  boss  to the sergeant  dont know
enough to swallow after youve chewed
if you must scrap with something ill
have you chased up among the goats
where you can scrap all day long i
guess a little sidewalk-poundingd take
some of the fat offn your brains as well
as where your belt hits you the next
time you feel that you must try to queer
a reporter you come to me first and ill
tell you what to do understand 

  the sergeant understood-perfectly 
and captain hendrix got practically the
same rebuke from burke who added-
 and youre in a  good-night-to-you
scrape cap at that that fellow leigh
is a bulldog when he once gets his teeth
in

   you may just as well close the joint
or chuck up your job unless you make
peace with him and his crowd as for
neil and schmidt ill attend to them
dubs later

   meanwhile if i were you id detail
about half a dozen of the huskiest cops
in my command to lay for that brace of
mutts and give em locust pie for supper
toa man of hendrixs type making
peace was merely a matter of purchasing
the silence of another

chapter xii

the meeting with burke

durke yielding to that grim humor
that was one of his saving graces
sent his name into the sentinel as a citi-
zen who desired to further the movement
to clean up the dives one evening
he walked into the reportorial room at
the municipal all of the members of
the combine were there with the excep-
tion of griggs

  no game was in progress jennison
was gloomily puffing a pipe  bronson was
stabbing his desk-lid with an ink-eraser
the others were doing nothing in particu-
lar

   evening boys said burke  regu-
lar hive of industry this i spose leighs
got away with all the news again and left
none for you 

  the men smiled rather sheepishly


the railroad mans magazine

   well went on the  boss  what
y going to do about it seems to -me
that hes got this crowd cinched hes
not only held his own but hes licked you
to a standstill

   hes just been lucky growled jen-
nison  and then too those curs allen
and halstead have been putting him on
to things

   humph muttered burke  hal-
stead and allen dont account for that
and he threw on the table the sentinel
with a denunciatory editorial marked
with a blue pencil

   no replied jennison  that must
be charged up against hendrixs fool
tongue

   burke reflected

   look here he said at length  as
the matter stands leigh has got the best
of you-

   of all of us interrupted ely a
glint of mutiny coming in his eyes

   i said of you replied burke with
an ugly emphasis he gets the news in
spite of you and he publishes it too
well what are you going to do about it  
ely shrugged his shoulders but did not
reply neither did the others burke
gave a grunt of impatience

   how is it you managed to work your
freeze - out game before and yet dont
seem able to do the same to him   he
asked

   leighs a star man you must remem-
ber replied jennison he isnt like
those other chumps that we had to do
with he knows the district-

   you bet he does said the  boss
with a short laugh  and for that rea-
son im sorry that you didnt have sense
enough to keep him in the combine thats
where ive got it in for this crowd you
let leigh go

   in fact you forced him out from
all i hear you were so cussed sure that
you could drive him from the district that
you didnt take the trouble to be even
civil to him

   you had to get his dander up right
away like the fools that you are and
its getting on for election too

  there was a rap on the door jennison
opened it

   mr leigh would like to see mr
burke said a waiter

   show him into my private room and

tell him ill be there in a minute said
the  boss

   then he turned to the others

    leighs as gritty as hes clever you
see it is a pity that you aint the same
and if there aint less chair-warming here
this room will be to let

   he stalked out slamming the door

   leigh returned burkes rather effusive
greeting in a businesslike way and after
listening to some jollying in regard to his
recent newspaper work and declining an
invitation to drink said abruptly

    i wish that you would shut down on
your games up-stairs burke if you dont
ill have to do what im really unwilling
to do

   burke looked at leigh for a full half
minute

  then he said pausing between each
word

    billy - leigh -r- you - have-cer-
tainly-got-a-magnificent-gall 

    not a bit of it asserted the reporter
 its a plain proposition everybody
whos in the know and a good many who
are not are on to what goes on over-
head incidentally ive two or three
sworn statements of ex-patrons of yours
who have squealed to me thought it
well to get em before i called on you in
case-

  case of what said burke cu-
riously

    case you didnt know what was good
for you or in other words if- you re-
fuse to close down-and we neednt waste
many words over it-the record is go-
ing for certain people and things-in high-
burg as you know the municipal is on
the list-at present but burke youve
been good to the boys whatever your mo-
tives were also allen and halstead feel
pretty bally over the idea of my ripping
you up considering that they have been
your guests and are now working with
me

    i want to say right here that they
havent given me a word about the games

i didnt ask them anything regarding
them i dont think that they would have
told me anything if i had so taking it
all round i would very much prefer not
to write up the municipal  and i hope
that you wont force me to do so of
course all this is in confidence

   burke looked at the speaker curious-
breaking the combine



ly if he had been given to emotional
relapses one might have been forgiven
for thinking that judging the expression
on his big rubicund face he was now
thinking deep

   youre a fair fighter leigh and  be-
lieve what youve told me about allen and
halstead its a pity-oh its a pity that
youre not on our side id have you
managing editor- well never mind
that but if ever youre out of a job come
to me

  leigh laughed lightly

   all right he said  and much
obliged  dont think though that ill
have to trouble you for some time yet but
what about the municipal 

   outside of your story what will your
people do if i dont shut down  

   im not in the habit of giving away
the intentions of my employers replied
the reporter

   of course not billy said the
 boss  hastily  of course not i for-
got myself when do you want my answer
about this 

   now

  burke whistled  i guess theres no
chance of a compromise or diplomatic de-
lay where you are concerned but ill let
you know my decision to-morrow still
whats the hurry for a day or two 

  the reporter hesitated  make it to-
morrow then at two oclock im sorry
that i cant give you any longer but the
fact is that my arrangements wont allow
of my so doing

   by the big potato but youre a cool
one billy  said burke as he held out
his hand leigh stopped at the door

   ive had a hint given me he said
quietly  that somebody may or may not
try to stop my mouth with a bunch of
greenbacks in regard to the harrow
street casino i know that youre not the
father of the idea because you have never
been reputed to be an idiot

   i just want to say this went on
leigh  that if you know and are the
friend of the man who thinks of attempt-
ing this thing-call him off because if
he tries it i shallcertainly run him out
of business and out of town if  can and
id like to add that hendrix isnt a young
man besides hes got a family

   you told me not so many weeks ago
said burke  that you were going to re-

    	r r

ply in your own way to my offer to be-
your friend and youve certainly done
so now if i could make a mistake about
you you mustnt be hard on another who
happens to do likewise people have got to
find out what kind of a fellow you are
dont be too rough on them for trying to
do so

   good night replied leigh  but
dont forget to pass the word to-you
know who

  burke looked after him as he left the
room pursed his lips shook his head re-
gretfully and calling for pen and ink
wrote a short sharp note to hendrix

  after some thought he sent short notes
to other police captains by special mes-
senger

  before this happened and while leigh
was on his way to the municipal he had
met and was stopped by alderman
schmidt who looked seedv and unhappy
-totally unlike the-aggressive individual
of a few nights before

   mr leiglv- he began

  leigh stepped aside if you have
anything to say to me come to my office
and say it i dont care to talk to you in
the street

   just a word mr leigh just a word
persisted the other  let up on us a little
why not you havent shut the place up
-but youve done just as bad youve
scared all our customers away theyre
afraid well be pulled

   youve changed your tone since the
last time i saw you- replied leigh con-
temptuously

   ach what a fool i was-a thousand
fools in one fool and mr leigh theres
people wholl not forget you if you let
up theyll thank you one hundred times
-yes  he leered at the reporter mean-
ingly  yes more as a hundred and
send them to you the thanks in an en-
velope maybe ha ha  think  
leigh glared at the alderman for a mo-
ment and passed on without a word

chapter xiii
busted

t t was nearly midnight when leigh re-
    turned to the office that night

   lots of news eh  said leigh as he
eyed the busy writers


the railroad mans magazine

   heaps  replied allen

   and the funny thing about it is said
halstead  that most of the stuff is  sta-
tion-house a fellow lost a pet white
crow that speaks seven languages dutch-
man appeals to the cap of the eleventh to
make his wife rush the growler more fre-
quently male and female weary willies
ask sergeants of the fifth to marry them
 um mused leigh  seems to be a
change of heart among the cops

   yep said allen jerkily  and
more than that doc onslow of st
marys hospital-little beast that he is
-rung us up about an hour ago to say
that a kid sumpter street way had swal-
lowed a pair of shoes

   what  cried leigh

   pair of shoe-laces explained hal-
stead

  it looks to me boys as if there was
something doing declared allen

   i think said leigh quietly- 
think that weve busted the combine 

   mr leigh to the phone  said an of-
fice-boy

   its me-burke came over the wire
 i just want to say that im closing
down-up-stairs you know-to-morrow
and billy im getting tired of having
this combine crowd around here so im
telling em to get out spose you havent
got room for em up at your place 
leigh held a conference with his col-
leagues then he said to burke

   i can make room for all of them ex-
cept ely and jennison if they care to
work with us

   good for you the boys will be thank-
ful im sure so long

  as i toldyou remarked leigh as
he replaced the receiver  the combine is
busted

  jennison had called earlier in the eve-
ning at the eleventh precinct station-house
-where in response to his query as to
whetlwr there was any news captain
gregory commanding spake thus

 yes weve got one or two good sto-
ries but they are not for you exclusively
leigh and the others will get them too
what in thunder do you mean
jennison demanded

  just this leigh and his crowd get
nearly all they want whether we give it
to them or not how they do it i dont

the

 know and i dont care but i do know
 that the people who refuse to give up to
 them get it in the neck sooner or later

    now i aint going to queer myself
 with leigh by shutting down on him just
 to make things good and easy for your
 lot see

    and judging by whats happening in
 the newspapers it is much safer and cer-
 tainly more pleasant to be a friend of
 leigh than otherwise

    all right replied jennison threaten-
 ingly  ill see what the  boss  has to
 say about this

    if i were you answered the cap-
 tain with a smile that meant many things
  id keep out of burkes way as much
 as possible until after election and then
 perhaps youll find it better to make your-
 self scarce altogether

   later he tore up a personal letter from
 burke in which he was requested to see
 that  all reporters got the news of his
 precinct the other police captains did
 likewise

   and they knew quite well why they
 were so instructed burke and burkes
 men had had quite a sufficient taste of
 leigh in view of the election

   how burke again got control in high-
 burg is another story and one that is il-
 lustrative of the fickleness of the public
 in its affection for municipal reform

   how leigh was made secretary of the
 citizens league the body that was main-
 ly responsible for burkes overthrow-is
 not that local history too

   in later years he having fulfilled many
 of his legal ambitions was slated for an
 assistant district attorneyship on the inde-
 pendent ticket burke threw the weight
 of his influence in his favor and leighs
 election was the result for the  boss 
 was like unto a windfall having some
 rotten spots with intervals of soundness
 he had a high regard for official integrity
 even if he did not himself possess it

    to his followers he said 

    leighs a safe man for the place if
 we put one of our own fellows up hed
 know too much and could work us if he
 wanted but with leigh theres no chance
 of our getting the double-cross even if he
 wont show favors

   and there is a mrs leigh who was a

 recent railroad patents

by forrest g smith

some of the details which help to form the evolution and prog-
ress of railroading in the united
states and canada

a no conductor car-

with no intention of dealing exclusively
with the inventions made by mr rowntree
one of whose inventions is referred to far-
ther  in this article we feel compelled to
refer briefly at least to a new departure in
the line of the pay-as-you-enter type of car
devised and patented no  febru-
ary   by him

  it is generally recognized that on com-
paratively short lines such as branch lines
and  suburban lines passing through terri-
tory which is but sparsely settled the em-
ployment of a conductor on each car is a
source of expense which yields but little re-
turn although it has heretofore been neces-
sary

  the type of car shown in this latter pat-
ent is so constructed that the motorman may
conveniently perform his usual duties and
at the same time attend to the collection of
fares from the entering passengers to his
controller-box are added a couple of levers
by the manipulation of which he may control
with ease any and all of the doors of the car
and the cash or ticket box is also supported
upon the controller so that he may attend to
the collection of fares

  his station is within the car as there is
 defined platform and passengers both en-
tering and leaving the car pass to either side
of him but not in front so that his vision
is at  time obscured

distributing car heat-

passengers on railroads no matter how
comfortable they may be made in other
ways have noticed that the air in the vicin-
ity of the seats is stuffy even in the severest
weather this is due almost solely to the
fact that the heated air-currents are allowed
to pass to the forward part of the seal and
most naturally become confined and render
the occupant of the scat uncomfortable

  also as is well known car-seats are re-
versible and when so moved the inclination
of the seat changes mr frederic w butt
of brooklyn new york has taken advan-
tage of this fact and has provided an auto-
matic means whereby the seat of a passen-
ger-coach will at all times be heated to the
perfect comfort of the passenger

  the device invented by mr butt and
shown iii patent no  february  
consists merely in a deflector or baffle-plate
which is mounted beneath the seat and is so
connected with the seat-reversing mechan-
ism as to direct the heated air-currents to-
ward the back of the seat whether it be in
one position or the other

j

to prevent rail creep-
ing-the ordinary tie-plate now in use
while effectual in preventing spreading of
the rails does not even assist in preventing
creeping of the rails and in fact after it
has been in place for a considerable time
will only loosely engage the rail

  numerous attempts have been made to
devise a tie-plate which would frictionally
clamp the rail which it was intended to hold
but usually such devices embody wedges or
clamping-bolts both of which are undesira-
ble in many ways

  g	a hassel of mckeesport pennsylva-
nia has disclosed in a patent no 
february   issued to him a tie-plate
construction which while slightly more ex-
pensive probably than the ordinary plate
serves not only its primary function but
will also prevent creeping of the rails

  this tie-plate is in two parts-one of which
is disposed upon the other and each of
which is formed with rail base engaging-
flanges similar to those of the ordinary
plate each part is further formed with
spike openings and these openings in the
two parts of each plate are so located that




the railroad mans magazine

when the parts are assembled the openings
do not exactly register

  as a result when the spikes are driven
through the parts and into the tie the parts
will be drawn together so to speak and
consequently their rail-engaging flanges will
frictionally clamp the base-flange of the
rail the flanges of one part engaging the
base-flange of the rail at one side and those
of the other part at the other side

 the plate has been adopted by a large
rail-manufacturing concern of pittsburgh

j

guairding the guard-
rail -it is at present customary to
either merely spike down guard-rails or to
secure them by means of tie-plates but
neither method insures the proper spacing
of the rail from the main or track rail it
is true that it has been proposed to utilize
spacing-blocks but as these blocks are not
rigidly secured in place they are liable to
lose their efficiency for this purpose

  tt has also been proposed to connect the
main and guard rails by bolts of sufficient
length but even with this expedient the em-
ployment of spacing-blocks in addition is
necessary

  to combine the efficiency of the connect-
ing-bolts and the spacing-blocks in a single
device which possesses the advantages of
both charles a allen of steelton penn-
sylvania has secured a patent no 
february  

  it consists merely of a u-shaped member
which is placed between the main and the
guard rails and is held in place by the bolts
which are sometimes employed in securing
these two rails together

new p a y e car-now that

pay-as-you-enter cars have come into gen-
eral use efforts are being made to economize
in platform space and yet retain all the ad-
vantages of such a car in the ordinary
constructions of such cars now in use the
employment of two doors instead of one
at each end of the car adds considerably to
the length of the car platforms

  in a patent no  february  igro
issued to harold rowntree of chicago
illinois there is shown a structure in which
this disadvantage is overcome and the seat-
ing capacity of the car is materially in-
creased in the car of this patent a railed
enclosure for the motorman is provided up-
on each platform or rather at each end of
the car for there is  defined platform
space unless indeed it be this small enclo-
sure

  rearwardly of the enclosure and with-
in the body of the car is arranged a swing-
ing-guard which when in one position co-
operates with the enclosure-rails in such
manner as to prevent the entrance of pas-
sengers at the front end of the car although
when in the other position at the rear of the
car it permits of such entrance

  this guard which extends only about
half-way across the car takes the place of
the usual doorway of such cars and that
side of the car opposite the entrance side
at each end is entirely closed and affords a
seating space which in the ordinary car is
wasted the exit doors for the car are
located one inwardly or in other words
rearwardly of each guard

  another feature of the invention resides
in the fact that the opening and closing of
the entrance and exit doors is simultaneous-
ly controlled by the conductor through the
turning of a switch-handle upon the guard
resulting in the supply of current to a suit-
able motor operatively connected with the
two doors at each end of the car



a locking journal-box

-the theft of journal-box brasses is al-
most encouraged in the present construc-
tions owing to the fact that the lids may be
opened by any one it is not desirable to
have locks for the lids for it requires too
much time to open them when so provided
and yet it is desirable that some means be
provided whereby the opening of the box
may be rendered practically impossible ex-
cept by the employment of a suitably de-
signed opener

  a box which will secure the desired re-
sults in this direction and will further pre-
sent the advantage of having its lid held
firmly in place in such manner as to exclude
dust is shown in patent no  febru-
ary   issued to samuel t bole of
philadelphia pennsylvania and assigned to
and adopted by the j g brill company of
that city

  the box is extremely simple in construc-
tion and the lid is entirely removable it be-
ing seated between a flange at the upper side
of the opening of the box and a latch at the
lower side this latch is held in place by
a strong spring and is depressable to dis-
engage from the lower edge of the lid
whereby to permit of its removal

  there is little or  possibility of remov-
ing the lid of this box except by the use of
a special tool which has a portion adapted to
engage beneath the flange at the upper edge
of the opening of the box and a portion to
engage with the upper end of the latch and
depress the same out of engagement with
recent railroad patents



the lid when the tool is swung down the
upward pressure of the latch as well as its
inward pressure both of which it exerts
serves to hold the lid firmly in place and
prevent the entrance of dust



a safety coupler-

while numerous devices have been offered
to permit of the coupling and uncoupling of
freight - cars without the necessity of the
trainmen going between the cars they have
usually embodied rock or winding shafts
which are not only liable to become clogged
with ice but are seldom so constructed as to
be operated by the foot of a trainman on
the car while the train is in motion

  mr james r carmer of wilmington
delaware has patented no  feb-
ruary   a device for this purpose
which apparently answers all requirements
instead of employing shafts and the like he
makes use of direct levers of which there
are two at each end of the car they being
pivoted between their inner and outer ends
and having their inner ends connected to the
coupling-pin at the respective ends of the car

  the outer ends of these levers project to
the sides of the car and are within easy reach
of a trainman upon the car so far as foot-
manipulation is concerned a they are as
easily accessible by hand from either side
of the car

a spike with teeth-this

months search for new devices discloses a
spike which must be mentioned as it em-
bodies features which arc not to be found
in the ordinary spike nor in others which
have been proposed for adoption the spike
mentioned has been patented no 
february   by john dellwo of
grantsburg wisconsin

  in its structure it does not differ from the
ordinary spike now in use except that upon-
its rail-engaging face it is provided with
sharp ribs which are adapted to bite into the
edge of the base-flanges of the rails which
it holds by doing this the spike serves not
only its original purpose but it also serves
as a means whereby the rails are prevented
from creeping

  in other words it not only holds the rails
to the ties but also prevents creeping to any
appreciable extent

economical trolley-

hanger-necessarily the wheel-bars
of trolley wires receive the greatest wear
owing to the impact given them by the

trolley-wheel it is now customary when a
trolley-hanger becomes worn to replace the
entire devise with an attending expense
robert s mcfeely of scalp level penn-
sylvania has devised a trolley-hanger so
constructed that when the wheel-contacting
part becomes worn it may be readily re-
placed

  in the patent no  february 
 issued to mr mcfeely it is proposed
to provide the trolley-hanger with a wheel-
contacting portion which may be readily re-
moved and a new portion substituted when
the original one becomes worn

  this portion is held in place by a spring-
latch which is not affected by the passage
of the trolley-wheel but which may be read-
ily manipulated by a lineman for the purpose
of substituting a new one

answers to patent prob-
      lems

w m monroe louisiana-are there
 any patented devices for raising the
journal-boxes of cars through the
medium of the steam or air lines of a train

  a number of such devices have been
patented and some are in use as far as the
assignment department of the patent office
indicates there is no apparent reason why
such devices should not be practicable -

wm l atianta georgia-is the gyro-
 scope car an entirely new inven-
tion 

  no it is merely the carrying out so to

all foreign countries after a patent
has been secured in this country

  by  means a patentee should consider
first of all whetfier the industries and need
of each country foreign to this will demand

  a careful study of the needs of each

brain teasers

here is one right out of the shops boys
how many of you gan solve it

 from h a nichols of butte montana we have received the follow-
 ing teaser

      in a building with eleven floors there are four elevators in use for
 the sake of convenience they are designated as nos i   and  they
 all start from the first or ground floor in the morning beginning with
 elevator no  at  am sharp no  starts at  am no  at 
 am  and no  at  am the running-time is such that no  passes
 a floor every minute no  every i minutes no  every  minutes and
 no  passes a floor every  minutes

      for instance elevator no  starts at  am and reaches the second
 floor at  am the third floor at  am and the eleventh or top
 floor at  am from where it immediately descends on the same
 schedule or no  starts from the first floor at  a m and passes the
 second floor at  am and reaches the eleventh floor at  am
 and immediately descends on the same schedule reaching the first floor at
  am and then immediately ascends and so on

     the problem is when does the first chance occur after starting in
 the morning that all the elevators are at the same floor at the same time
 and what time of day which floor is it and what direction are the
 elevators going-up or down

     the answer will be published in our june issue

      it can be done in nine moves

      distance north-bound train  miles time  hours 
 minutes speed  miles per hour

      west-bound train-distance  miles plus  feet equals  -
 miles time  hours  minutes or  - hours hence we convert the
 time and distance of the west-bound train into twelfths which in the time is
  twelfths and in the distance  twelfths dividing the latter by the
 former we obtain a speed of  - miles per hour of the west-bound
 train so -u of a mile is gained each hour by the west-bound train
 and in  - hours the gain will be the product of  hours multiplied
 by - feet which gives  feet or approximating the length of
 the train  feet two and one-twelfth hours decimally is  and
 - of a mile is  feet

answers to april puzzles

on the editorial carpet

    this is where we gather in the hut boys tell our
    troubles listen to yours and sing a few old songs

in spite of the pleasure that we naturally
take every month in talking about what
we are going to do the following month it
sometimes becomes quite a difficulty to do it
in what we feel to be an adequate manner
it is all very well for us to sit here and de-
scribe month by month how we are going
to put on a record-breaker for the next
month but at the same time it is mighty
hard to convey a true impression of the care
we have taken in testing every cylinder
bolt crank and gage in order to be sure
that our engine will pull up every grade
without blowing itself to pieces

  we might tell you that we are going to
give you such and such a good story or
such and such a good article until we have
blown every bit of our steam - pressure
through the whistle but beyond making a
certain amount of noise this would be the
only result achieved if we did not convey
to you the fact that there is not any other
line where you can come across rolling-
stock at all like that which we are at con-
siderable pains to gather together

 what we want to convey to our readers
is that we are trying to create for them an
absolutely new class of stories and articles
now we want to know if our friends be-
lieve we are doing this

  so when we come out and specifically tell
you that a certain story has everything else
scared off the right-of-way we would like
you to just switch in and couple on to a
pen and a bottle of ink or even a stub of
pencil and the back of a requisition form
and tell us what you think about that story

  dont be afraid that we will put a derail
under your front trucks and ditch your lit-
tle effort into the waste-basket we wont
we are always mighty glad to be jn per-
sonal communication with our readers and
we dont fuss to ourselves like a leaky cyl-
inder every time somebody comes along and
tells us to jack up our boiler and put new
gears under her

  now for instance we are going to tell
you what we think of our june number
when you have read the stories we men-
tion just break in on- our wire and let us

know how much you think we dont know
about it

  there is one feature that we are abso-
lutely confident you will welcome it is the
opening story of another series of  honk-
and-horace  yarns by emmet f harte

  you will remember that the genius of
honk and the industry of horace had cre-
ated an ideal little town called valhalla of
the hills you will now learn how honk
administered and regulated this utopia and
how horace played the part of his grand
vizier and pooh bah in keeping undesira-
ble citizens from bursting in upon their chaste
atmosphere

  besides this story we have two other
fiction stories which we consider among the
most powerful we have ever published
one of them is a story by nevil g hen-
shaw a writer who is in our pages for the
first time and the other is by edward c
fellowes

  mr henshaws story is a cowboy yarn of
unusual type while mr fellowess story is
a tale of railroad construction in which a
steam-shovel plays a prominent and tragic
part it will probably be called  bucepha-
lus avenger we particularly want to
know what you think of these stories

  perhaps the most important feature of
our june number however will be gilson
willetss first collection of stories sent in
from his new tour they will be published
under the title of ten thousand miles by
rail we only need promise you that they
are in every way equal to all the other
stories that mr willets has gathered from
railroad men and given back to railroad
men through this magazine

  and incidentally we thank those of the
boys who gave mr willets such splendid
yarns youre a lot of bully fellows-and
may your sand-domes never grow gray

  another unique feature will be the true
story of a man whose passion for excite-
ment has been more than satisfied through
vivid experiences in twenty-six wrecks

  our old friend robert h rogers will
be along with a mighty fine article on  the
roundhouse foreman
	the railroad mans magazine

 besides this we are going to do some-
 tliing which has never been done in amer-
 ica before and we are not sure it has ever
 been done anywhere that is we are going
 to give a sketch of anatole mallet the in-
 ventor of the mallet articulated compound
 engine nobody should miss this

 now please try to bear in mind what we
 said about switching in  us remember
 we really want to hear from you lets

 jint ahead for june

   tribute to the shacks

 one of our readers sends us the ap-
 pended poem-a worthy tribute to the
 freight - brakeman - and certainly he de-
 serves to be immortalized in verse the
 poem was taken from the mauch chunk
 times and was printed some time in 
 listen brother shacks

a brakemans life

by m a murphy

 tis  oclock and the midnight freight
    is ready for to start

 they are waiting for their orders

    and the signal to depart

 the night is cold and cheerless

     no star bedecks the sky

 and shivering stands the brakeman

while moments slowly fly

 how little do ye people know
 the struggles and the strife

 the hardships and the dangers

 that beset a brakemans life

 when lightnings flash and thunders peal
 midst storms of snow or rain

 youll see these fearless brakemen
     at their post upon the train

 i wonder whats the reason

    why some people shun them so

 and cast reflections on them

no matter where they go

 they little know the anguish
    that their cruel words impart

 and how they wound the feelings
 of a noble brakemans heart

 before he leaves hell kiss his wife
     and little ones good-by

 and kneeling ask a blessing
 of our  father up on high

 and though the night is fierce and wild
     he falters not nor fears

 and the fierceness of the storm seems but
     as music to his ears

 onward over hill and vale
    he goes with lightning speed

 he seems but as a specter

     behind that fiery steed

   though snowflakes gather round him

  the wind may sigh and moan

   he sits upon his freight-car

   like a king upon his throne

   tool he hears the whistles blast
   call loudly for  down brakes 

   how quick responds the brakeman

   from his reverie he wakes

   but hark a noise a frightful crash 

   a grinding hissing sound

   and far beneath the wreckage soon
   a mangled form is found

   a shattered home an orphans tears

   a widow in despair

   and brothers of the b r t

   in goodly numbers there

   though sad and lonely she may be

   no want nor dire distress

   shall enter through that cottage door

   a widow to oppress

   for like a ministering angel

   our brotherhood is there

   within this lowly cottage
   alike their sorrow share

   no bigots there shall slight him

   nor scoffers cause him pain

   he has gone to help his brothers brake
   on gods own heavenly train

we didnt say it wouldnt work

several letters have reached us from
evidently well - informed friends ob-
jecting to the answer given  j w leav-
enworth washington in the march  by
the light of the lantern this reader
wanted to know whether the injector pre-
sumably on a locomotive would work with
the injector-check placed on top of the boil-
er we replied in the affirmative as the
pressure  opposing the instrument would be
the same in that case as in the usual prac-
tise

   this  doubt was satisfying to the cor-
respondent and we should have stopped
there but we didnt in a moment of en-
thusiasm we allowed a little personal preju-
dice to intrude and declaimed with some
bitterness against the innovation which par-
donable zeal for a cause has resulted in a
slight scorching in the frying-pan

  our friends hasten to assure us that
many examples of recent locomotive con-
struction have the checks as located and
that our objection to discharging the rela-
tively cold water into the live steam space
is easily taken care of by piping it from the
check to any point in the interior of the
boiler where it is considered good practise
to deliver it

   it thus appears that a nightmare as it
first appealed to s can be resolved into a
on the editorial carpet

feasible scheme after all and that we were
a little behind the procession-in this par-
ticular instance at least-in not keeping up
with new departures

  we are admitting all this with cheerful
candor in spite of the fact that we were all
right in our answer it was first feared in
reading these kind criticisms that we had
been heavily scored on but we are scarcely
even mussed up

  we never said that the altitudinous boil-
er-check wouldnt work in fact our ver-
dict was just the reverse but we didnt like
it and proclaimed our disregard with its
whys and wherefores now that vve have
gone on record we are going to stand by
our guns in this personal opinion some of
us not so far from this office have pounded
checks and tinkered with injectors for over
twenty years both on and off the road and
the chance in  j ws  question was too
good to miss our little say although of
course not until after a direct reply had
been made

  we believe that less than one-half of one
per cent of all engines in the country at
this writing embody this questionable im-
provement and are equally confident that it
will never be received with general favor
by motive-power management we are now
going to fortify ourselves with some inter-
views to support the latter assertion and
will probably have more to offer on the sub-
ject next month

one more

one more wanderlust classic  and of
the many that we have printed in this
department of our magazine this is one of
the very best the author sent it from
oakland california he states that he is
a reader of this magazine and a railroad
man at any rate he is some poet as well

the hobo lineman

by a m s

under the spreading jungle tree
three lazy hoboes slept
while oer their prostrate bodies
the red ants gaily crept

the sun poured down from heaven

  a flood of golden light

but they heeded not for they slept by day
  and rode the freights at night

their adventurous dispositions
deserve a better cause
than trying to beat the railroad

  and break the countrys laws

  but still they keep on going

 content what comes their way

  as they eat with untold relish
  their one poor meal a day

  they have no trials no worries

  they take life as it comes

  this bunch of social outcasts

 this horde of lazy bums

   but each one has a story
  of how it came to be

  and im going to tell the stories
  that some have told to me

  the first was the son of a preacher
  whos took to hobo life

 because some other fellow
 departed with his wife

  another missed his calling
  and blamed it all to fate

  then realized his error
  when he found it was too late

  the third well his is the story
  that takes a while to tell-

 a story of zigzag coursing-

  the tale of a man who fell

 back in old new england

  in the shade of the granite hills

 my boyhood home and ambition

  there i went the pace that kills

   my dad had a paying store there

  but he died a bit too soon 

  for when he left it to me

  i changed the place to a saloon

  my wife was a lovely woman

 whom i schooled with when a boy
 did she love with a love as pure
 as gold without alloy

   but i learned to love the booze boys
  as i drank it i thought it fine

  until  was never myself but had
  a skinful all the time

  my wife soon died of grieving

  and i planted her neath the pine

 and ever since that occasion
 its been hard lines for mine

   ive tramped the states all over
  from maine to mexico

  and  guess ill keep on tramping

 till im landed down below

   im a tramp and you ask me why boys
  why for greatest curse on earth
  the stuff that kills ambition
  and shatters the family hearth

   and so boys thats the reason

 im headed now for the east

 im going to old new hampshire
 to have my annual feast


the railroad mans magazine

 i always get the spring fever

  and have to hit the road

with a pair of hooks upon my back

  for thats my daily load

ive hiked for the western union

  the postal too as well

have shinned poles all over the union

  and worked for the rocky mountain bell

 but my days will soon be over

  and things will then be bright

ill end my stately poem

  and i wish you all  good-night

grades you can climb

we dont know who was the man who
first made use of the expression
 god helps those who help themselves but
he was a man with keen insight into human
nature and he must have had a fine healthy
working knowledge of the lord in our
humble opinion this man ought to be found
out and be placed along with shakespeare
josh billings and other master minds who
could put the wisdom of a thousand essays
into one sentence

  all this has to do with the query that oc-
curs to us sometimes why does a man who
wants a job as a brakeman in tuskaloo
minnesota write to new york to the inno-
cent and unoffending editor of the rail-
road mans magazine to find out how to
get it he probably lives next door to the
man who would hire him if he just got out
of his slippers and put on his shoes and
rang his neighbors front-door bell

  understand we like to have you write
and when we can help you we like to do it
also if ou feel that you want to write to
us before you go and ask the man across
the street for a job do it but bless your
life for all the good it does you in helping
you to get the job you might as well write
to a fortune-teller

  we think our reputation for wanting to
help people is a pretty good one and its be-
cause we really do want to help you that
occasionally we turn round and tell you
how to help yourselves sometimes its just
a matter of stopping to think

  for instance most of the men who write
to us for advice as to how to get positions
know what road they want to work on
they know what the division point is that
they want to hire from then its a matter of
knowing what official hires that particular
class of men

  you dont have to know the name of the
official you know that the train-master
hires brakemen the master-mechanic prob-
ably hires firemen and engineers

  tlie roundhouse foreman hires most of
the grades of roundhouse men the shop
foremau or superintendent of shops hires
machinists and the chief clerk of the freight
or passenger departments hires his staff the
chief despatcher usually hires the operators

  of course there are some slight differ-
ences of practise on various roads but if
you are in doubt you can always get exact
information by writing to the division super-
intendent if you want a position as a pull-
man porter or conductor you will find out
the district headquarters for your section
and write to the district superintendent of
the pullman company and if you dont
know it write to the headquarters at chi-
cago and theyll tell you

  there are we know conditions where a
little advice from us might be useful and
valuable such as employment in foreign
countries or in different localities from the
one the writer lives in and we are very
glad to give you the best of our information
what we are trying to do is to save you
time

  incidentally before writing remember
that although the editors heart is large his
mail-bag is apt to be pretty nearly as bulky

  above all things dont misunderstand us
we like to have you write we like to hear
about your troubles and about your success
and we like to get you on the road to saving
you the one and getting you the other with
as little waste of time as possible

kind words and a correction

editor the railroad mans magazine

permit me to thank you for the many
pleasant moments which i have spent
reading that most excellent magazine
the railroad mans it is certainlv full of
good interesting reading the kind that rail-
roaders and the reading public in general
like

  your  by the light of the lantern
department has been a great benefit to me

i found many questions answered there that
i needed in my examination for engineer -

  i have been a locomotive fireman now for
five years and three months and have just
succeeded in passing part of my examina-
tion for engineer we have to pass on train
rules machinery and the westinghouse air-
brakes so you see it requires consider-
able study to pass successfully

  we are rather well paid here in compari-
son to other places

  we make  for our division of 
miles for engines weighing  pounds
or over under thatweight  and 

  passenger firing pays  per hundred
miles engineers get   freight and
 on passenger trains per hundred miles

m b wheeling west virginia was slightly
wrong

   the woman was never employed to run
an engine on the laurel fork and sand hill
as the road from volcano junction to
volcano was known  but was the wife of
the regular engineer and ran merely for the
pleasure of it

   a woman named hewit used to handle the
engine on the c and k v a narrow-gage
road from cairo to macfarlan west
virginia some years ago but was not
regularly employed

   the old road to volcano had long dis-
appeared and the road abandoned as there
is no business there now the oil being
pumped out except for a few wells

   the road i am employed on-baltimore
and-ohio monongah or fifth division is
certainly very rough it contains twenty-
three tunnels and fifty-two - bridges the
tunnels are from seven-eighths of a mile to
two hundred yards in length so you know
what a job the engine crews have passing
through them

a travelers tribute

editor the railroad mans magazine

i have been a constant reader of the
railroad mans magazine  since its
birth it is the only diversion i care to indulge
in the snow-storms in wisconsin have been
disastrously frequent and while waiting
this evening for a prodigal north western
this poem drizzled through my head

the day is cold and dark and
dreary

with apologies to longfelloiv

the day is cold and dark and dreary

the trains are late and the people weary
the crowd still clings to the depot wall

and at every gust their thoughts all fall
on the day so dark and dreary

our life gets cold and dark and dreary
when trains are late and weather weary
our minds still cling to the smoldering past
the rest of the year- time-running fast
and the day is cold and dreary

be still my friend and cease repining

for here she comes with headlight shining
thy fate is the common fate of all

through each snow-storm some train must
     crawl

some days must be cold and dreary

two letters

editor the railroad mans magazine

for fifteen years i have been railroading
most of it in mexico the place to
quote you in the article in your february

magazine entitled  being a boomer brake-
man  its better to keep on this side of the
gringo belt

  i have also read other pieces in your
magazine taking a slap at mexico and her
railroad laws and can quote you them if
you wish for i have the magazine from no
 to date	

  this is not a bouquet so i hardly expect
to see it in print but it would be a good
idea for you to do a little investigating as
you claim to do before printing as truth
articles of this nature you are talking to
a good many thousand railroad men and we
all like the magazine but-let us have the
truth about that country

  mr herr says if ever a train-a freight
train at least-made running-time in
mexico it is not recorded  the books of
national history and he draws his con-
clusions from the only place in mexico
where all trains are not almost invariably on
time-the only division in the republic where
conditions are so bad on account of poor
water and long desert stretches that it takes
a first-class railroad man to get over the
road on time and where hoboes and boomers
are the rule-and who expects them to make
any time anywhere except a meal-ticket
stake 

 he gives s the impression that he
worked for a full month and drew down
eighty dollars mexican the pay-schedule
will show  the mexican central that that
could hardly be unless he classed himself
as a mexican they dont pay by the
month they pay by the kilometer and a
good rate of overtime is paid for all that
is made

  and the judge said  not guilty and
imposed a fine upon them of sixty-four
dollars eh rats

   worked as timekeeper  that chihuahua
division and i broke and ran train there
i worked at jimulco and out of there and a
finer set of mexicans composing the official
element there i never hope to see any-
where

  just the same when a hobo goes against the
mexican booze he gets slapped into the jail
and kept there till sober and why shouldnt
he

  in the second place there is no one in
jimulco with authority to try a case of that
seriousness ie throwing a woman from
a running train they would be taken to
torreon furthermore if they could show
the woman was beating her way they could
have her arrested whether she was hurt or
not

  and those salt mines i heard about them
for months till one day when i was running
train on the national out of san luis
pntosi i went to the office and took a lay-
off for ten days i put in that time en-
deavoring to locate those salt mines in
which prisoners suffered such pain  never
found them you prove every tale you
print where are they please

  i ran trains down there on three roads
and had several accidents yet i never
	the railroad mans magazine

spent a day in jail and was only called upon
to give my evidence in court three times
each time being courteously treated by each
mexican official with whom  came in con-
tact

  the day of  high-ball  is past the rail-
road man now is too well educated and too
quiet a family ajul home respecting man to
believe these tales  mexican law made
for the gringo booh

l knightson los angeles cal

editor the railroad mans magazine

  after reading mr knightsons criticism
on my remarks concerning mexico and
reviewing the article to which he takes
exception i am convinced that even
mexican law would concede that i am
guilty as indicted only on a technicality
and that there is no evidence of malice afore-
thought or intent to criminally misrepresent
the conditions

  it may be that mr knightson formed his
impressions of mexico under more favorable
circumstances than i and he certainly must
have had more time in fifteen years to ac-
quaint himself with conditions and sur-
roundings than would any man in the brief
span of a year

  i simply made a brief mention of events
which came to my personal notice and must
insist that they have not been distorted or
sensationalized

  the statement if ever a train-a freight-
train at least-made running-time in mexico
it is not recorded on the books of national
history appears especially obnoxious that
any one should read such a sentence and
take it seriously reflects an amazing dense-
ness on the part of the reader or a very
lamentable crudeness in the authors ef-
forts at humor

  however since i am on the defensive i
must insist that the statement as it stands
is absolutely correct as the  books of
national history  make no record of freight-
train performances

  as a matter of fact the wonder is that
freight-trains are able to cross certain sec-
tions of mexico at all bad water poor coal
and a hundred other things handicap them
and i found it to be a fact that even first-
class railroad men not infrequently had a
few hours overtime marked down on their
trip-slip

  regarding the pay for brakemen let me
say that to my personal knowledge one
young man whom i have known from his
youth up worked on the mexican central
for one month and when he cashed in at
the pay-car he drew down eighty dollars
mexican money

 he did not exactly class himself as a
mexican but he had a braking partner by
the name of juan martinez juan is neither
a german name nor a shamrock trade-marlc
and this youth has always believed that juan
was a mexican indian juan and this ac-
quaintance of mine used to sleep under the

same blanket and juan owned the blanket
too

  we both frequently sought the by-ways
and hedges for passengers who were asked
to contribute to the general fund and in
such hunts they often found women riding
in the coal cars and box cars sometimes
they were put off the train but no one ever
thought of having them arrested which
brings us down to the questions of mexican
law

  jimulco a few years back had a magis-
trate it also tiad an adobe jail any one
desiring further information on this point
might communicate with mr charles wil-
son of frcdonia kansas he was in
jimulco at the time of the trial referred to
in the article under discussion and he will
undoubtedly tell you that the two americans
were tried on a charge of throwing a
woman from a train that the evidence justi-
fied an acquittal and that among other
punishments ordered by the magistrate was
the provision that the americans should pay
the woman a dollar a day until she had
recovered her injuries

 the mexican statutes are above my
criticism hut there are hundreds of cases
to show that in isolated villages and dis-
tricts law plays less than prejudice in the
trial of americans

  	believe that mr knightson must admit
that the average mexican cherishes little
affection for the gringo as education and
civilization advances in the mexican repub-
lic these conditions will change they are
less noticeable now than they were fivelyears
ago

  mexico city to-day is one of the most
beautiful most romantic and most cosmo-
politan cities of the world the rights of
the foreigner are respected and he is a wel-
come guest but mexico city is only a small
part of mexico

  the isolated mexican hamlet may appeal
to some but pardon me if i refuse to grow
enthusiastic over it

  i	agree that the truth about mexico
would be interesting reading and when the
whole truth comes to fight there will be
pages of it which will make a balzac novel
look somewhat like a sunday-school paper
along side of it

 advantage  the phenomenal success of ideal boilers is also largely due to the fact that they
 are made in sections so that even their largest parts can be carried through an ordinary size doorway
 for this reason they can be quickly put in old buildings without disturbing the occupants in fact
 in unmodernized or old types of houses they can be erected including the necessary
 piping and radiators without the necessity of removing the stoves or hot-air furnace
