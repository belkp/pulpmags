 the wonders of knowledge

  an editorial by hugo gernsback

	it is surprising that we who pride ourselves on our ac-
 quired knowledge have to admit that in the end there
is really nothing that is known to any degree

  it is really amazing how little knowledge we actually
have on any subject and how little man can hope to know
of his surroundings whether we go up to the heavens or
down into sub-microscopical worlds the story is always the
same we find that there is nothing knowable and if we
were to draw a scale we would have to admit that our
knowledge on any subject compared to a mile measuring
stick would probably not go further than the thousandths
of an inch on this scale

  the trouble of course is the limitation of our senses
we can hear only over a comparatively minute range of
sound we can see only over an infinitesimally small section
of the spectrum we can feel only the surface of some of
the objects and these most imperfectly we can smell prac-
tically nothing and our sense of taste is woefully deficient

  it seems that only the effects of certain things are per-
ceptible to us and even those to no large extent take
such a simple thing as sound we have not the slightest
idea of what sound actually is the same of light noth-
ing at all is known about the actual nature of light today
and we certainly do not know much more about it than
was known in newtons time possibly less we know
of a number of light phenomena and we know
what happens when light strikes certain objects but of
the nature of light itself how it is propagated into space
we know next to nothing

  the same is true of course of such instrumentalities as
for instance radio waves-although it is still an open
question that they are waves they might be something
entirely different that we know nothing about what hap-
pens after these so-called waves leave the transmitting

aerial until they strike the receiving aerial nothing at
all is known

  when we come down to material objects the case grows
even more hopeless no matter what you touch -or feel
nothing at all is known about the ultimate constitution of
such matter every year scientists change their definitions
of molecules atoms electrons and protons all of which are
theoretical because man has never seen or felt one and it
would seem that for thousands of years to come nothing
can possibly be known about the ultimate constitution of
matter

  on the other end of the scale nothing much is known
either we talk glibly about our planetary system and the
stars beyond-island universes and nebulas-but nothing is
actually known of these one theory is as good as another
and even the origin of our own planet and the solar system
is subject to a great deal of controversy in truth no one
knows anything about it and here again one theory is as
good as another

  how can we have any knowledge of the world around
us when we have not the slightest knowledge of ourselves
we do not know what makes us think what makes us rea-
son and we have no proof that our reasoning such as it
is is correct the interpretations which we place upon
most things are simply the result of following someone else
who thinks he had the right idea about it but probably
fifty years or a thousand years hence it will be found that
our entire reasoning was wrong from beginning to end

  our senses by no means guide us aright thus for in-
stance the ancients thought the sun was actually rising
while the earth stood still it took thousands of years to
find out that this reasoning was wrong and that it was
not the sun that rose but the earth that turned

  most human logic is erroneous and the sum total of our
knowledge therefore is dangerously close to nil

 for an hour or more we experimented with the creatures discovering that light blinded them
 but they were conscious of our presence


tyrant of the red world

by richard tooker

	the passing of the meteoric sphere was the greatest

  hazard experienced by the arthanes famous crew dur-
ing the first flight beyond the earths atmosphere in 
words fail me when i attempt to describe the grinding
roar of countless tiny bodies against the adamant walls
of the aldane space ship the suspense each one of us felt
as to our fate the flush of triumph when the great ship
plunged through the last of the meteoric clouds to shoot
onward toward the moon like the thunderbolt of an im-
mortal

  my post from beginning to end of that fateful voyage
was at the intricate keyboard of the cosmograph or space
radio which employed light impulses in the cosmic rays
instead of electricity for communication over vast dis-
tances i was in an excellent position to judge the re-
actions of the crew of nine and as soon as we recovered
from the terrific shock of propulsion through the strat-
osphere i began sending our impressions to earth by
means of the cosmograph

  we had previously agreed to communicate by numbers
aboard ship each having his numeral displayed on his
space suit which was worn inside the ship continually
owing to fear of sudden disaster which might force us to
parachutes or arthane hand-guns at any moment not
long after projection which had been made from a huge
steel tower near the experimental plant in the arizona
desert it became evident that all thinking and acting
mast be almost as mechanically perfect as our name-
numbers if we were to circumnavigate the moon success-
fully as planned by frank aldane no  commander
and inventor of the space ship

  absolute zero was reported by no  in his thermal
soundings directly after we cleared the meteors no 
in the heating compartment had turned on the sun-heated
boilers to full blast yet we felt no discomfort in the space
suits owing to the extreme cold of the stellar void never-
theless i thankfully obeyed no ls command to open
helmets and remove airtight gauntlets which were un-
comfortably restrictive to vision and movement

  no  had turned on the air generator in the compart-
ment just below mine and the interior of the ship was
charged to breathing density when  drew in my first
breath of correctly diluted oxygen shutting off the tube
from my private tank we must all have been antici-
pating franks next command to open sun-shutters on
all lookout ports on the dark side of ship

  sign off a moment i transmitted hastily to aldane
hangars where franks brother herbert was receiving
our messages and broadcasting them to the world we

a liquefied gas with molecules highly electrolyzed the suc-
cess of the aldane expedition largely depended on this super-
fuel for which the aldanes had named the first space ship

      	many of the early stories of science about ad-
      ventures on other worlds were called utop-
      ian because the author used the interplanetary
      adventure as a means of picturing another civil-
      ization better and finer than our own

        and just as men dissatisfied with tbeir pre-
      sent conditions have gone venturing into new
      parts of the earth so men in the future may set-
      tle upon other worlds

        but suppose that a group of explorers who
      had hoped to return to earth after their inter-
      planetary journey found they were stranded
      upon an alien planet and hope of rescue was
      slight faced with the prospect of remaining
      for the rest of their lives what would be their
      reactions what kind of a world would they
      try to construct for themselves and what would
      be their adventures in fighting for the necessi-
      ties of life upon a hostile planet these ques-
      tions our author answers in this striking and
      unusual tale

are about to look for first time on the universe at 
miles altitude

  all interest in my immediate surroundings had van-
ished by the time the eyes of my periscope-like lookout
were opened at first  could hardly believe that what
 saw was not an illusion that it was the same sky which
had greeted my eyes for thirty-odd years of life on earth

  in a field as devoid of color as an ocean of lamp-black
gleamed millions of stars literally millions we had
long since passed the point where the reflection of sun-
rays on earths atmosphere could tinge the firmament
with faintest azure even more startling was the fact that
the legion stars of lesser magnitude and many even of
first magnitude were of an intense sapphire blue though
i had foreseen in theory how the heavens would look at
that altitude actual observation was quite something else

  before us the moon stood out like molten silver against
the blue-spangled walls of darkness it had grown to
nearly five times its size as seen from earth which ap-
peared behind us as an illimitable grayish haze beyond
the pall that enshrouded the earths face were the stygian
coal sacks and the magellan clouds now revealed to
be millions of distant stars in nebulous aggregations the
sun when i focussed briefly upon it safe from injurious
rays behind the lens filter was a lurid mountain of fire
bearded and crested with a vaporous corona

  the voice vibration of no  recalled me suddenly to
the pressing duties of my post and with clumsy fingers
and inadequate vocabulary i began the stupendous task
of reporting to earth the appearance of outer space

  by that time our speed had gained to  feet per
second and a number of unpleasant physical disturbances




wonder stories for august 

had combined to make rational thinking somewhat diffi-
cult however the explosions of the occasional rocket
blasts by which the arlhane was propelled were scarcely
noticeable to some extent we were becoming adjusted
to extremes of sound temperature and velocity

  i had at last completed an abbreviated description of
the stellar skies when i chanced to look down into the
air generating chamber to rest my eyes for another ob-
servation it was altogether disinterestedly that my gaze
became focussed on no s bands now bare of gauntlets
and fixed on a delicate instrument of the air generator
dials the hands were long and white in the pale glow
of the electric bulb strong yet somehow too soft looking
for a mans hands surely luther cuthbertson the chem-
ist supposed to be in no  space suit did not have hands
like that i looked again and in cold stunning compre-
hension i knew that those hands belong to a woman to
barbara weyden chief chemist for the aldancs

  for an instant i was completely dumbfounded hours
before i had fought out a silent battle between love and
ambition and ambition had won i never had expected
to see barbara weyden again and the knowledge that she
accompanied us to what we all believed to be certain death
somewhere in space was unnerving

  my next message to herbert aldane was not what no 
relayed from the control room

  barbara weyden is in space suit of no  i flashed
over the invisible wires of the cosmic rays what hap-
pened to cuthbertson

  hoped you wouldnt find out came the reply in the
crackle of the electrons cuthertson is either crazy or
yellow or both he started to run away came back
broke down here in receiving room and confessed to let-
ting barbara go in his place disguised by space suit
hes raving dont tell frank

	my reactions after the discovery that barbara wey-
don was one of the crew may be surmised mingled
joy and despair possessed me if we were doomed to
die then she would be with me to the end and there
was  something exalting about meeting  death in space
with the woman one loved but what if frank aldane
discovered her what if the morale of the crew was
shaken by the discovery that a woman dispensed the
precious vapors in the air generating room

  but i gradually calmed myself by assembling the
facts in the matter barbara was more capable of hand-
ling the air generator than cuthbertson since she had in-
vented a large part of it moreover she had passed thq
preliminary examinations and physical tests with higher
honors than two of the crew though women had been
disqualified for actual membership in the crew

  more and more optimistic as we tore on through the
black silence i reassured myself that none would be the
worse for barbaras ruse and turned back to the peri-
scope i was now able to locate several planets and
major constellations in the bewildering riot of stars sat-
urn glowed bright yellow on the left the dull red mars
not far to the right neptune and mercury smaller and
less fiery were outshone by the streaked blood-red face
of jupiter king of the solar bodies softly green and
tinged with violet venus hung directly west of us above
the sun

  owing to my position i could not see directly under

the ship but my view of the nadir was sufficiently acute
to give me that queer feeling of instability caused by
seeing stars beneath one spiral and crab nebulae
thronged the clouds of darkness galaxies suns binaries
trillions of light years from the solar system forcibly
impressed me with the minuteness of all that earthman
could see even through his most powerful telescopes

  at a distance of several tnousand miles from earth our
planet began slowly to take shape behind and a little be-
low out of the mist-like curtain that at first had ob-
scured it the great globe loomed up in greenish moon-
fire covering the whole heavens in that direction against
the pale background of the oceans the american contin-
ents stood out in silhouette the polar ice-cap buried in
vapor

  all this i transmitted to earth via the cosmograph
while we rocketed on through immemorial silence

  we had been in the ether for more than six hours be-
fore there was any change in the arthanes course then
no  in the pilot-room reported electrical phenomena
somewhere to the left not lightning but vast areas of
dormant voltage which we did not understand serge
bjornsen or mad bjornsen as we had come to call the
strange man in no  space suit was seldom in error his
genius had been largely responsible for the arthanes
navigation instruments and frank aldane promptly fired
a steering salvo as suggested throwing us in a vast arc
away from the unknown disturbances of the void

  directly after the change of course i caught myself on
the verge of sleep starting up all atremble to hear no ls
voice in my ear through the tube

  if drowsiness is noticed as a result of sluggish circu-
lation take two of the red food tablets with the digitaline
content

  i fumbled in my space suit for the case of concentrated
food and stimulants which we all carried and glanced
anxiously below to see how the stowaway was faring she
also was reaching for her case of foodtablets

  at five oclock earth-time we began to fall into the
moon at that time with a mere touch of hand or finger-
tips on either side of the cosmograph i could move from
wall to wall of my compartment yet the tendency was
to adhere to the front wall because of the slight moon
gravitation then drawing our virtually weightless bodies
forward

  it is impossible adequately to convey the gradual in-
crease in size and visibility of the moon as we rushed to-
ward it like a beam of light within  miles of the
stupendous sphere the whole northern heavens were hid-
den as by a world in the molten stages of evolution only
the lower right edge of ihe moon was in the shadow of the
lunar night whose inky tentacles spread over into the fiery
deserts and mountains where a sunset was in progess

  by nine oclock the moons gravity had become so strong
as to be distinctly noticeable i began to have trouble
keeping my place before the cosmograph at no ls sug-
gestion we strapped ourselves in within  miles
of the moon a brilliant white light shone into the ship
from the conning windows no  visible through the
circular passageway ahead -of me was illuminated by a
halo almost like limelight in that unearthly radiance
we dived into the moon like some phantom express train

  at an altitude of about  miles the moon began
tyrant of the red world



to lose its spherical contour and become a tremendous
circular landscape the eastern quarter in deep shadow
through the blinding white light that enveloped us the
mountain ranges loomed up like the jagged spines of
prehistoric saurians some of those twisted bluffs were
 feet high and never had known the erosive effects
of humid atmosphere around the pitch-black crater
maws the sharp edged ridges seemed to bubble and throb
under the sunlight temperature of  degrees c

  no ls sharp command to prepare for deceleration
salvos caught me off my guard but i
was not the last one to climb into the
waiting shock absorbers which had en-
abled us to withstand the shock of pro-
jection and would now serve the same
purpose in descending and slowing
down but so slight was the moons
attraction that we scarcely noticed the
tremendous back-thrust of the forward
batteries

  eight hundred miles per hour

twelve hundred miles off luna
called no  as we returned to our
posts from the shock absorbers

  when i looked again through the
periscope an awesome change had
come over the lunar terrain no longer
did the haze of distance obscure those
mighty mountain ranges divides like
titanic axe blades thrust up at us seem-
ing to sway and teeter as we plunged
nearer badlands mountains devils garden nothing on
earth could compare with that sun-weltered landscape of
the moon as wre leveled off on our circumnavigating
course the altitude-maintaining rockets and drift adjusters
detonating steadily along the arthanes great keel

  we crossed hundreds of miles of saw-toothed mountains
and tundras of lava before we reached the edge of the
lunar night then earth disappeared behind us the sun
glaring balefully over the stark horizons

  prepare for altitude salvo came no ls warning
through the speaking tubes train cameras for record-
ing peak contour of moon

 the roar of the altitude batteries broke in on my specu-
lation as to the maneuver about to ensue glued to
my recoil chair especially constructed for j ust such shocks
i strained forward to the periscope mirror wtatching the
dead world take shape below as we soared higher i
made out the diminishing horizons indicating the pear-
like elongation on the side away from earth then
leveling off at a tremendous altitude we reached the mas-
sive knob behind the moon and again dived down
nauseated by the swift change of course as i transmit-
ted the observations to earth no  droned the news
that electrified every one

  under the moon-going back to terra

  the knowledge that we were homeward bound at last
revived me like a shower of ice water i wanted to leap
down into no s compartment seize her in clumsy em-
brace and dance a mad ring-around-the-roses but i did
no such foolish stunt i remained stolidly before the cos-
mograph sending monotonously

  coming back west of moon starboard shutters

closed against sun port windows unveiled cameras
working at eight hundred miles altitude alls well

  we were nearly  miles from the moon on the re-
turn to earth when no  informed us through the speak-
ing tubes that mad bjornsen was to try out our safety
devices by leaving the ship in the void at the time the
anticipation of such an intrepid feat was a nerve tonic
that i at least fully appreciated for the hours of unre-
mitting strain had begun to tell heavily in spite of the
digitaline stimulant

through the circular passage to the
control room still brightly lighted by
the moon i saw no  in his space suit
flounder into view feet scarcely touch-
ing the floor as he pulled himself
along as he dived into a lower pas-
sage leading to the exit air-lock i
turned to the cosmograph flashing the
news of bjornsens venture to earth

when i looked down again no 
was helping bjornsen into the air-lock
he carried a coil of light steel cable
with a hook on either end to attach
him to the ship when he dropped off
ready at his belt was an arthane pro-
pulsion gun the bloated space suit
with its human core was finally forced
down into the air-lock and the inner
door closed and screwed down by no 

  with some anxiety as to whether ma
bjornsen had penetrated barbaras dis-
guise which was dispersed by her cool resumption of
duties i at length turned to the periscope and adjusted it
for observation on both sides the ship no ls tolling off
for deceleration salvos followed but we were not required
to get into the shock absorbers

  eyes glued to the periscope mirror i resumed trans-
mission on the cosmograph as i waited for no  to ap-
pear in the dense darkness hemming us i knew what
bjornsen was doing in the air-lock adjusting private oxy-
gen duct igniting heat-cartridges in the lining of his
space suit for resisting stellar temperature setting the
charging valve on the arthane hand-gun by which he would
shoot himself this way and that

  suddenly an odd figure floated up from under the port
side of the ship it was bjornsen but he did not ap-
pear as a human being the sunward side of his bal-
loon-like space suit was vividly lighted the dark side
invisible save for a faint glow from the rapidly receding
moon he seemed as helpless as an infant and was for
a fact at the mercy of the lunar gravitation save for the
arthane gun and the tow cable attached to the ship at
the outer door of the air-lock two streams of vapor
exuded from his heels where relief cocks permitted the
gases from the burning heat-cartridges to escape

  i was almost convinced that he had become uncon-
scious from some unexpected strain when he suddenly
came to life pointing the arthane gun toward the moon
there came a flash of blue flame and bjornsen soared
swiftly backward as far as the cable would permit him

  so absorbed was i in the startling performance of no
 that i was hardly conscious of my steady manipulation
of the ray-key all speaking tubes were silent through-
out the ship i sensed that every eye was bent through

lookout ports upon those perilous acrobatics in the void

  again and again bjornsen shot himself through the
vacuum defying all hitherto unbroken laws of gravita-
tion and human limitation and to cap the climax he
became so confident that he unhooked the cable and
horrified all of us by darting about loose in space

  it was while the crew was most absorbed in no s
nerve-racking exploits that the hand of doom stole over
us i shall always believe that if no  had not left the
navigation dials it would never have happened at the
instaht mad bjornsen was descending from one of his
upward plunges i heard no s sharp outcry from the
pilot-room

  magnetic vortex-eighty miles at ten degrees sw star-
board batteries for gods sake

  the last i saw of bjornsen was his puffed figure alight-
ing behind the arthane s sun-reflector then the steering
broadside flung against me the right wall of the cosmo-
graph room i had no sooner recovered from the shock
of the exploding rockets when the whole ship heaved up
under me like inflated rubber a strange tingling and
numbness seized me as if i had encountered a charged
wire and above the thunderclap of exploding rocket-
tubes i heard the bellow of no  in the pilot room

  give her everything astern-its got us

  it was no ls voice in the main speaking tube com-
municating with all members of the crew that prevented
panic as we awakened to the reality of disaster

  caught in magnetic vortex he reported mechanically
calm all power shut off for the present to conserve
fuel vortex may throw us free or break up of itself
stick to your posts and dont worry notify me im-
mediately if no  is sighted in void

chapter ii

ill land you or bury you

	as i rallied to the inspiring call of our captain there
was but one phase of our misfortune that persisted in
depressing me-barbara weyden was hurtling with us
to certain death we had been prepared to die but not
with a woman among us with heavy heart i looked
down into the oxygen chamber wondering when and how
it would happen and if it would be possible for me to
tell her i knew

  while i gazed down in despair at the ungainly shoul-
ders of no  space suit i was suddenly galvanized by an
unexpected movement the pressure lugs on the inner
door of the air-lock were slowly revolving as some one
operated them from the outside i could hardly believe
my eyes when the heavy round door swung upward and
a huge helmet pushed through mad bj ornsen had sur-
vived 

  a cheer was raised throughout the ship when it was
discovered that our capable if eccentric pilot had man-
aged to get back into the ship with bjornsen back at
the navigation dials new hope sprang up in our breasts
and frank aldane ordered me to inform earth of our
misfortune describing as best i could the nature of the
space storm in which we had been caught before i had
well begun no s energetic reports were exploding in

in  the magnetic vortex or space storm was discovered
to be caused by the friction of billions of molecular meteorites
revolving in small orbits between worlds

my ears as mad bjornsen got back to work in the pilot
room

  i scarcely know how to begin in recounting those first
hours in the grip of the invisible space storm the sheer
immensity of our helpless whirling in the colossal elec-
trical cyclone staggers me it soon became evident that
even with mad bjornsens piloting frank aldane could
do nothing with the ship and with the gradual deaden-
ing of overstrained nerves we gave up the last hope of
reaching earth alive

  in two hours of bodily and mental agony we were car-
ried hundreds of thousands of miles off our course into
the sun at last foreseeing the danger of drifting so far
from earths attraction that we would be drawn into an
alien body or worse into the sun frank aldane began
repeated efforts to blow us free broadside after broad-
side of reserve tubes were fired without perceptible effect
wre could not tell whether the gas explosions were neu-
tralized by outer voltage or the magnetic forces simply
too strong for us to overcome after half an hour of
terrific bombardment the rocket tubes again were silent
the only outer sound being a low hissing or whispering
which we now know to be caused by the meteoric dust
which generates the magnetism

  no ls report following the futile expenditure of fuel
was anticipated the reserve tanks of arthane were al-
most empty we had only enough fuel left to break our
fall upon an alien body if we were fortunate enough to
reach its gravitational influence before being drawn into
the sun

  notify aldane hangars begin work on relief ship
immediately frank concluded his report

  a little later i watched concernedly the answer of her-
bert aldane as it crackled and sputtered in the micro-
spectrtiscope the cosmograph was being slightly af-
fected by the electrical disturbances but not enough to
hinder the interpretation of the messages its immunity
i ascribed to its utilization of the cosmic rays as an im-
pulse medium instead of electrical or radio waves

  not long after we had become resigned to our fate
frank gave orders for pairing off into watches to permit
sleep as i anticipated it fell to no  and me to take
care of the cosmograph and air generator i must at
last make known to barbara my knowledge of her iden-
tity

	one look into the open face of no s huge space hel-
met was enough to inform barbara weyden that i had
discovered her that look was also sufficient to convey
my sentiments for an expression of relief softened the
lines of her strained face

  youre the only one who knows she whispered when
we had unhooked our speaking tubes to prevent the rest
of the crewr overhearing our secret you wont hold it
against me will you

  go to sleep i managed to utter in a voice strange to
my ears

  as no  sank to the deck without another word i
heard frank aldane calling my number through the tube

  send message earth he relayed with an intensity
unusual in him -invisible body somewhat larger than
moon located q miles nw vortex now show-
ing irregularity in rotation and is heading away from
sun if vortex breaks up arthane will be drawn into in-
tyrant of the red world



visible planetoid crew all alive and seem well expect
to report visibility of unknown body within next hour
with the eagerness of revived hope i transmitted the
message to earth and turned to the lookout reflector
there was little change in the size of the sun but earth
had dwindled to a small disc of pale green the moon a
dim brighl point near by more than a million miles we
had drifted since our plunge into the space storm

  i had climbed down to the air generator to increase the
hydrogen content when i heard sharp voices in the con-
trol room scrambling back to the cosmograph i looked
down the passage leading to the prow waiting tensely
certain that something was amiss i saw no  lurch into
view moving at a lubberly run by means of his tiptoes
and the hand-rings attached to all the walls a moment
later franks voice reached me

  transmit earth-jacques artois french inventor and
metallurgist dies shortly after resuming watch in service
department apparently congestion blood stream then
through the main tube to all the crew no  just passed
on any member of crew noticing numbness in hands or
feet hang head down for several seconds to redistribute
blood no more digitaline

         	 

  were loose heigh-ho wake up were loose
the screaming of a man gone temporarily mad with
joy brought me out of deep sleep on the deck of the air
generating chamber i did not need to seek further for
the cause of the commotion i felt as one recovering from
a long siege of virulent fever no longer was there any
centrifugal attraction pulling me down to the beams of the
space ships keel with a mere flirt of my wrist i set
myself afloat drifting gently into a corner conscious of
an all-pervading quietude

  throughout the ship the crew was rousing up with croaks
of triumph that were meant for cheers frank aldane
and mad bjornsen were talking then order was re-
stored and no  began broadcasting to us

  vortex has flung arthane into gravitational field of
unknown planetoid we are more than ten million miles
from earth hanging almost motionless in space but be-
ginning to drift gradually toward point northwest of sun
speed steadily increasing as suns gravitation is overcome
by closer planetoid we will continue to fall into un-
known world now faintly visible to the naked eye

  i	had started up the steel ladder leading to the cosmo-
graph chamber where no  was on watch when no  s
next command dashed my spirits

  all hands remove space suits and assemble in main
cabin for conference

  after that nothing could avert barbaras discovery and
after the first shock of anticipation i decided that nothing
unpleasant would come of it barbara had carried on like
a true soldier of science she deserved only praise from
frank aldane or any other

  with a push of one hand i drifted back from the ladder
as no  came down hand over hand like an acrobat on
exhibition in a moment we had unhooked our speaking
tubes and were staring silently at each other out of the
cavernous maws of the space helmets

  you are in for it now i finally said

  i know but whats the difference she rejoined a little
wearily cuthbertson was afraid if i hadnt found

him out you might have had a maniac on your hands and
a useless air generator

  while we got out of the space suits in obedience to or-
ders barbara told me how she had found out the yellow
streak in cuthbertson and had arranged secretly to sub-
stitute for him when the individual oxygen tanks were
charged in the chemistry department just before the pro-
jection of the ship she had been afraid that she could
not pass inspection but the deep space helmets had per-
mitted her to as well as her size and build which were
rather masculine

  but we forgot about the past when we faced each other
in the coveralls which served as light uniforms aboard
the arthane we were as drawn and pallid as a couple
of resurrected corpses it seemed impossible that a few
days strain could have wrought such changes

  mad bjornsens heavy voice was booming down the
passage from the control room before we had quite fin-
ished stripping off our harness thus urged to haste we
dived into the connecting tube like two inflated ruhber
dolls pulling our airy selves along by the hand-rings

  frank aldane was just on the point of speaking to the
haggard caricatures of men in the control room wheat
barbara wafted into view no ls mouth remained half
open for a count of three while gasps and exclamations
were heard from the rest of the crew

  good evening frank finally found voice a most
unexpected pleasure

  he raised a restraining hand your apologies are all
anticipated miss weyden he said kindly i regret
that the cruise has not proved more enjoyable so cuth-
bertson lost his nerve i rather suspected him but he
was such a demon in the troposphere

  i wanted to go so much she begged

  and it looks as if you had your wish frank said with
a faint smile lighting his worn face as he glanced about
him at the circle of ghastly fatigue-shrunken faces al-
low me to introduce the real identity of no  he con-
cluded

  there were various reactions to the discovery that bar-
bara weyden had stolen a march on us but mad bjorn-
sens most attracted me he said nothing neither did he
evince surprise by look or action from where he sat
or rather hung before the intricate navigation instruments
his bright amber eyes glowed and twinkled with a light
that at one moment seemed amusement and the next exul-
tation somehow i could not help but feel insulted by
his intent inspection of our stowaway as far as i knew
mad bjornsen was my friend and barbaras yet beyond
the arm of the law i discovered something menacing in
his easy composure his excessive daring and the mon-
strous strength for which he had been noted at aldane
hangars and i could not help but recall with a shudder
his wild ideals of the superman by which he would revo-
lutionize society

  it was the sharp outcry of no  that recalled me to
the problems before us bruce castleton no  had
gone to sleep while we talked-the sleep of no awakening
he drifted gently to and fro in one corner of the control
room where he had been holding himself by the hand-
rings a moment before looking down on us with unwink-
ing eyes and lax jaw

  franks examination was swift and final another
one he announced grimly our best astronomer

	and stow alongside no  in service channel  w

  what has just happened needs no comment frank
resumed when no  had returned from his sad business
provided there are no further interruptions we will pro-
ceed with the business of this meeting

   our reckonings show that we have several days fall-
ing ahead of us-the endian unknown world which ap-
pears to be habitable witll the exception of spectrum line
 an unknown substance from now on any idea of
returning to earth in the arthane is madness our last
chance is this planetoid where we may survive until my
brother herbert reaches us with the relief ship

   i say may survive to be perfectly honest we have
scarcely enough arthane in the tanks to break our fall on
this alien body if we live long enough to reach its atmo-
sphere im being optimistic when i say that we have one
chance in a million to land safely but im going to hang
on until that millionth chance is gone and i expect every
one of you to do the same we have proved the possibil-
ity of space annihilation earthmans future is interplane-
tary it will take time of course but the trail has been
blazed and progress in this field is inevitable i think
that we who are soon to pass on or out ought to do it
with service to mankind our work is done whether
with the service to mankind our work is done whethei
we live an hour or a century longer

   but after all it is up to you individually whether the
hardships of duty are continued on the arthane any one
who prefers to quit now may consider his services suffi-
cient with my heartfelt gratitude for his aid thus far
he paused and concluded gruffly well what do you
say

we stick were with you one land us on that
planetoid came the quick irritable cries of the crew

   from the bottom of my heart i thank you said frank
his lips quivering with feeling then his whole figure was
tensed as his eyes grew grim and hard gentlemen he
cried ill land you or ill bury you deep

chapter iii

the landing

 for eight days we fell through the void into the un-
known world there were no more pow-wows in the
control room a few hours after our conference we
were falling with such rapidity that any attempt to relax
save in stupefied sleep would have been worse than futile

   on the fourth day after our release from the magnetic
vortex the body into which we were falling like a meteor
assumed definite form and color a tiny moonlike disc
on the outer edge of the solar system pale yellow in the
center tinged jwith pink that formed dim mottles earth
long since had disappeared the whole heavens having
changed with the exception of the sun and a few major
stars

   at intervals that grew more and more irregular no 
or no  notified aldane hangars of our position speed
of falling and the changing aspect of the heavens her-
bert aldane kept replying with encouragements and as-
surances that everything possible was being done to hast-
en the launching of a relief ship but his optimism soon
ceased to have any appreciable effect on us what might

happen a year from the present meant little when death
bad becomc an accepted eventuality i believe frank
aldane and mad bjornsen were the only ones who re-
tained a real grip on life the rest of us subsiding to a
stupid spiritless lethargy

  our digestive tracts must have shrunken in proportion
to our outer flesh during those awful last days though
the concentrated food tablets nourished us as no bulkier
foods could have done the gnawing hunger that inces-
santly burned in our vitals was not appeased nor were
our thirsts quenched by the scanty rations of water whicl
in spite of every economy dwindled rapidly

  we wont know when we go i recall barbara moan
ing once were dying by inches

  sometime during the fourth day no  did not awaker
from his turn of sleep and another space suit became a
bier as maurice howland was laid away in service chan
nel  w which mad bjornsen now referred to as the
morgue it was barbara who informed earth of our
third casualty she being as proficient on the cosmograph
as any of the crew after she told me of the tragedy
i recall enumerating the six that remained frank al-
dane mad bjornsen and dale sutherly in the control
room clyde marmouth barbara and myself in the sub
sidiary divisions

  the last day of falling is almost a blank we were
then shooting through the stellar darkness like a comet
and an encounter with dense atmosphere would have
caused terrific heat friction i no longer walked or float-
ed from air generator to cosmograph i crawled talking
to myself like a madman in my efforts to stay awake

  not until the last few hours was i able to rejoicc at
the rapid enlarging of the stellar body that meant life or
death to us like a wooden man i stared at the great
globe whose color tone had become predominantly red
as we drew nearer the thin stratum of atmosphere but
even then my chief concern was for barbara crouching
over her as she slept i would exult in miserly delight
over the fact that i was standing twice her watches and
she did not know it

  at  miles altitude the remainder of our water
supply was divided among us by mad bjornsen even
he giant of the crew in thew and nerve was staggering
his voice low and husky as he implored

  drink no  orders drink got to revive got to
wake up may need to use parachutes we strike air
in less than an hour

  herbert aldanes response to my message informing
earth of our approach to the outer atmosphere of the
planetoid remains vividly in my memory since it was
the last i was to receive via the arthanes wonderful in-
strument of communication

  relief ship well underway i read in the glow and
throb of the ray streams should be finished six months
billion hearts with you here carry on

  directly after that i fainted knowing nothing until
aroused by mad bjornsen on his rounds

  put on gauntlets and close helmet he called through
my eye-piece holes turn on oxygen tank and be ready
to leave ship in air if we fail to countercharge

  as he dived back into the passage to the control room
no  called through the speaking tubes

  lookout for countercharge stratosphere eighty miles
down 
tyrant of the red world



  we dared not enter the revolving shock absorbers for
fear we could not extricate ourselves in time if it were
necessary to leave the ship the recoil chairs must suf-
fice to break the shock i had no sooner tensed myself in
my own chair before the braking batteries crashed ahead
throwing me against the forward wall the great ship
hesitated quivering from prow to stern then plunged on
as i fell over the manhole leading to the air generating
room intent on joining barbara as the last act before the
probable wrecking the ship

  no  was clinging to the hand-rings before the kronite-
paned window on the starboard side fixing my atten-
tion on barbaras spacc suit numeral i strained down the
ladder against the varying shock of the braking batteries
now thundering with increasing power as frank aldane
increrased the detonating sequence using the last of our
precious fuel supply in the effort to break our fall

  barbara did not turn or speak when i at last joined her
at the window she merely pointed outside the plane-
toid was no longer a distant sphere only an illimitable
haze could be seen ahead behind and all about the stars
had dimmed markedly in a field of deep azure below
our lookout port one of the arthanes great collapsible
wings now spread for contact with atmosphere gleamed
like a colossal sword blade

  we were still kneeling enthralled before the window
when no s voice reached us through the tubes above the
rocket thunder

  air

	almost simultaneously with the triumphant shout a
sweeping steam-like hiss sounded outside as if we had
struck water the roar of wind must have been cyclonic
to have been audible through the insulated konel plates
of which the ship was constructed a sickening dipping
and swaying set in as the stabilizing fins bit into the thick-
ening atmospheric gases then above the awesome sym-
phony of wind and rocket explosions no s scream pene-
trated my ears

  look

  lo it was sunshine that we saw beneath us the first in
many a day of darkness and in the flash and scintillation
of that wondrous light and warmth were vast masses of
wine-colored clouds floating in what seemed to be a gentle
wind it was a new world-land in the sea of space be-
yond the gravity of earth

  mad bjornsens bellow crashed in our helmets a hoarse
voice answered with a slight shock the arthane sped on
as the forward batteries fell silent

  no more gas the news was relayed from the control
room and we heard mad bjornsens frantic yell level
off those fins its a dead-stick landing-three thousand
feet down and eighty miles an hour hold her one
the fins will never do it cried frank aldane get
the crew out in parachutes

  parachutes hell they can hardly move a leg ease
her off with all the surface youve got we wont hit hard
in that gravity

  we could hear no more of what was said i saw a dizzy
uprush of strange rainbow-hued terrain still water
gleamed between the blurred summits of low hills then
a scream in the control room was cut off by a grinding
shock a smiting darkness wheeled with fire  i seemed

falling and falling through inestimable space gasping for
breath andv feebly beating the air to arrest my descent

  are we the only ones it was frank aldanes voice
strained and hesitant as if he stifled groans of pain

  no marmouth is only shaken up and i think harbin
and miss weyden will pull through replied the deeper
steadier voice of mad bjornsen with the air dead in the
ship and the keel seams started i couldnt open their suits
a crack-up at that speed on terra would have made sau-
sage of us all

   and the air-lock-youre positive its jammed too bad-
ly for use

  yes i cant budge the inner door ill knock out a
window if you think  is harmless the stuff surely is
in the air by the color of sutherlys last test

   there was a pause before frank spoke again low halt-
ingly its all the same to me i think go ahead and
smash out that window on the starboard side get a sledge
from the service room im going out

  better not bjornsen objected sternly youre dy-
ing on your feet already a move like that will finish
you

   i heard labored breathing in the palpitant silence then
-never mind im done for anyway get the sledge
im still master of the ship and im going to be the first
to walk on the new world

  again labored breathing followed by mad bjornsens
growl of assent	

  i could hear the scrapings of a space suit on metal
walls the measured sigh of deep breathing through the
amplifying transmitter valve of the speaking tube then
footsteps returning from the service room and the ear-
splitting crash of bjornsens first blow on the kronite
pane which brought me fully to my senses i had been
overhearing what went on in the control room as one
who lies abed in the morning half awake

  for several seconds i did not move so much as an eye-
lash i feared to ascertain my injuries i lay listening
to the sledge blows the heavy impacts emphasizing the
soundlessness the motionlessness the utter immovable
inertia that pervaded me and my surroundings

  moving first an arm then a leg then all members i
was startled by the ease and swiftness of muscular re-
sponse i sot up so quickly that it seemed i had no
weight an instant i stood stunned and bewildered
then a sudden giddiness assailed me which brought me
once more to my back it was a reaction to the days of
falling i was becoming adjusted to motionlessness on
the surface of the planetoid

   the dizzy spell passed away presently and again i got
to my feet among the wreckage of apparatus scattered
about the sharply tipped deck of the air generator room
it was then i caught sight of barbara lying a few feet
away in the trough formed by one wall and the warped
deck

  barbara barbara i cried

   then the heavenly relief o he faltering reply

  im all here-i guess

   leaping to her side i bent over the mechanical ear in
her helmet shouting rather crazily were alive were
on the new world

  she seemed to arouse fully after that silting up
 against the wall with my help she asked in faint alarm
have you seen it


wonder stories for august 

  you mean am i afraid to look

  yes she whispered

  well look together i said proud that  was not
afraid of what we would see beyond the walls of the
space ship and proud that i could act as the protecting
male for such an accomplished young woman as bar-
bara weyden

  we crept to the starboard window a moment later
like awe-struck pilgrims before a sacred shrine

  the first impression we got of the new world was the
sunlight though dim it was not gray as if filtered
by clouds nor was it soft like dawn or twilight it was
more prismatic or translucent as if shining through a
screen of flying dust somewhere high overhead one
who has seen the faint tinge of red suffusing earth dur-
ing an eclipse of the sun can best visualize the sunshine
of the planetoid

  it was a wine-colored world beautiful yet unreal poi-
sonous almost to our earth-nurtured senses

	there were two low mounds directly before us the
  ship having fallen at the foot of a third mound de-

ppsits of limestone mingled with large calcified shells
covered these hills causing a dominant tone of white
in the ravines between the mounds which stretched as
far as we could see into the background were dense thick-
ets resembling the coral and seaweed formations at the
bottom of the sea bnt it was the ominous stillness of
the scene that was most disturbing rare beauty was there
in the landscape of the planetoid but it was a beauty
that seemed the catalyst of an unnameable menace

	the sudden cessation of sledge blows in the control
room called our attention from the window we heard
mad bjornsen call out

  heigh-ho crew a muffled voice from below re-
sponded-clyde marmouth in the service department then
barbara and i sang out our numbers

  stay where you are were the orders one is going
out breathe from your oxygen tanks until i find out
about this atmosphere

  a slight chill had crept in upon us from the control
room now open to the atmosphere of the planetoid with
unusual anxiety we could hear bjornsen and our wounded
skipper talking no  still was trying to argue frank
out of venturing forth in his injured condition but he
made no headway as he climbed out of the broken
porthole we heard frank say

  new world eh bjornsen no keep your hands off
i can walk alone good thing the gravity is light

  his voice died away in exultant chuckles as barbara
and i turned back to the window pressing helmets against
the pane in our eagerness to catch sight of the man who
would first walk on alien soil

  weirdly incongruous in that fairyland of coral and
lime the space suit of no  lurched into view he was
heading for the mound on the left his feet barely touch-
ing the ground arms locked tightly over his abdomen not
then knowing the real seriousness of his injuries we could
not entirely appreciate what a stupendous feat of mind
mastery over matter he was performing

  halfway up the slope he stopped and sat down with
such slowness that it seemed air pressure was buoying
him up his hands moved to the front of his helmet and
he unscrewed the eye-pieces he was testing the air

  it was frank aldanes last voluntary movement he
collapsed immediately afterward just as the hulking figure
of no  burst into view and bounded up the mound i
called to barbara and we dived into the passage to the
control room reachng the other end to find marmouth just
ahead of us

  unmindful of the alien turf we hastened up the hill
through the dim reddish sunlight mad bjornsen was
kneeling beside no  when we came up

  the air didnt get me frank was saying airs
all right but rare no use to bother with me hope
you- he gasped and seemed to faint

  mad bjornsen was rapidly loosening the front of his
helmet and we followed his example while we watched
the pale face-of our commander for a sign of returning
consciousness

  my first breath of air on the planetoid was searing
cold as if i were on a mountain peak but it was re-
freshing and the coldness appeared to be more a result
of the scanty oxygen content

  quite gently with an ease due as much to gravitational
conditions as to unusual strength bjornsen picked up
no  and bore him back into the control room of the
grounded rocket ship here we pulled off the dying
mans helmet and space suit aghast at the injuries we
found

  hes got the worst of it with sutherly muttered no
 they were standing right where the ship hit first

  just before he died frank aldane opened his eyes he
seemed to be sympathizing with us as if in death he were
more fortunate goodbye castaways guess i landed
you in hades instead of-

  he never spoke again

            chapter iv
            the tyrant

	in the exhausting reaction following the clearing of

  the main cabin death might have taken even greater
toll of the arthanes crew had it not been for mad bjorn-
sen only his brutal initiative could have prevented
us from sinking into a stupor whence none might ever
have awakened

  get out of those space suits and give one another
first aid he shouted at us in a tone that brooked no
dalliance

  no serious injuries were found during the hasty exam-
ination as soon as the last scratch was bandaged we
were ordered to inspect the ship from stem to stern 
what we found and reported to bjornsen steadied us
somewhat the arthane would never fly again and
most calamitous of all was the damage i found in the
cosmograph room our last link with earth had been
broken we could not hope to guide the relief ship with
messages

  i knew this before i ordered the inspection mad
bjornsen addressed us but i see you have come to
your senses so the time wasnt wasted we are here for
a year at least if the relief ship ever locates us but
our circumstances could be worse with the food tablets
left by the deceased added to our own remaining supplies
we ought to be able to exist for several months or until
we make a thorough survey of living conditions here
tyrant of the red world



  but the chief reason why im keeping you awake is
the alien element in this atmosphere so far it appears
harmless but it will take longer to judge definitely if
we begin to feel bad effects we must invent some kind
of filter for breathing meanwhile we had better look
for drinking water by that time we may be sure as to
the nature of  follow me

  outside the ship drawing the cool rare atmosphere
deep into my lungs the qualms of fatigue became less
noticeable again i was able to think logically to ap-
preciate our first venture into the new world

  the arthane had fallen on the summit of a prominence
considerably higher than the surrounding mounds and
ridges as evidence of frank aldanes superb piloting
we had struck glancingly plowing our way with grad-
ually increasing depth to the foot of the slope such a
fall on earth broken though it had been by braking
rockets and spread wings would have telescoped us on
the planetoid only the landing skids and keel had suf-
fered

  climbing to the hilltop under which the wrecked ship
lay we huddled together in dismay with the exception
of our new leader under a red-tinged sun the only
visible stellar body stretched an endless profusion of
white mounds and ridges between these monumental
promonotories rose the monster coral polyps it was
like a fantasy in oil by some super-imaginative artist

  the new world mad bjornsen suddenly exclaimed
spreading his arms to the scene ah freedom beauty
room to live

  while we stared at him in fear of his mind he turned
solemnly to us again apparently a master of his emotions

  bear witness space sailors he said in behalf of the
man who first set foot upon a new world i serge bjorn-
sen acting commandant of the aldane interplanetary ex-
pedition do hereby pronounce the name of this plane-
toid aldane world and may it so appear in all future
chartings of the void

  in view of what was to happen bjornsens respect for
the memory of frank aldane proved a poser but we
later concluded that frank aldane had been the one man
in the world whom bjornsen considered an equal

  it was clyde marmouths exclamation that aroused us
to a manifestation of life in the exotic fastness hemming
us looking in the direction he indicated we sighted
three specks against the blood-red horizon they grew
rapidly larger flying at considerable altitude above the
while mounds no distinct shapes were perceptible but
while we watched intently the creatures soared higher
and higher until lost to view in the pale rose mists of the
zenith

  theres life here bjornsen burst out and im going
to find out what it is harbin you and miss weyden
stay by the ship and see that nothing gets in stay awake
if you do nothing else marmouth will go with me and
well try to find water before we come in if any one
needs help hell fire a minimum blast from the arthane
hand-guns

  i wearily motioned assent and watched bjornsen and
marmouth set off down the slope in the direction whence
the flying creatures had been seen not until their buoy-
ant balloon-like figures had disappeared in the polyp
brakes did either of us speak

  i dont trust serge bjornsen barbara exclaimed ner-

vously maybe its my imagination but somehow i feel
well have trouble with him

  im afraid were all subject to hallucinations i
groped trying to comfort her i hope your fears are
nothing worse than nerves you know that if bjornsen
tries to carry out any of his far-fetched social ideas you
can count on marmouth and me to defend you with our
last breath

  lets go back to the ship she murmured shuddering
a little

  during our awkward though airy descent of the hill-
top we obtained our first good look at what we were after-
ward to call somewhat erroneously the sky-horses

  a startling whir of wings and a buzz like the vibration
of a rattlesnakes tail drew our attention to the reddish
sky of the planetoid directly above the ship a strange
winged creature was hovering as if looking down at us
with invisible eyes-invisible in that there were none of
the usual visual organs drawing our automatics which
were the only accurate death weapon we carried we pre-
pared to defend ourselves but the curious being seemed
to be peacefully inclined it hovered a few minutes above
us then swooped down alighting a few hundred yards
away on a great branch of the coral growths

  the body must have been fully eight feet long and it
consisted of a translucent and iridescent substance re-
sembling protoplasm the wings were of enormous
spread in shape and color like those of a dragonfly
two short antennae with ball-shaped tips protruded
from the browless yet beautifully rounded forehead
the buzzing we had heard seemed to issue from the an-
tennae the long shapely body shot through and
through with tints that changed prismatically with each
slightest movement terminated in a unipedal appendage
much like the flipper of a seal

  these details were noted before the being suddenly
lashed out with its awe-inspiring wings sprang up from
the polyp branch and settled quickly out of sight in the
tangle of the rainbow-hued thicket pistols still drawn
we cautiously approached the shadowy hiding place of
the monster but we found nothing but a cavernous grotto
which seemed to lead down into the ground for consider-
able distance

  deep in discussion of this unquestionable evidence of
interplanetary life we returned to the ship sat down on
the shady side and there fell fast asleep probably in
the middle of a sentence so tired were we

  the shock of cold water in my face awakened me i
staggered to my feet mad bjornsen was grinning at
me they had found water

  lakes of it he exulted yellow with phosphorous
or something similar but it wont kill we can survive
harbin and were standing the air fine

 it is useless for me to attempt a literal description of

  my sensations upon first awakening from a nights rest
on aldane world i awakened as if from an appalling
dream to find my visions a grim reality

  not until i moved was i reminded that i lay in the
control room of the arthane that sometime before mad
bjornsen had told us to get out our sleep while he watched
all around me a dense darkness weighed down a dark-
ness not black but of a peculiar purple if by darkness
i may convey the idea of an all-pervading blinding color


wonder stories for august 

  i say that the darkness was blinding yet there were
fleeting illusions of clarification objects seemed to
loom up then vanish before my straining eyes coupled
with the lightness of movement caused by gravitational
conditions there was little to remind me that i was really
alive until i reached out and encountered someones space
suit which proved after feeling inside the helmet to be
barbaras she was sleeping soundly

  to my dying day i shall ever recall with a shudder the
night sky of aldane world as i first looked upon it from
the cabin of the wrecked rocket ship of a lighter purple
than the ground outside it appeared to hang or float not
fifty feet above me a few stars gleamed redly between
the wisps of pale mist that moved hither and thither as if
on extremely high air currents i must have stared for
several minutes at the unusual firmament when a series
of odd noises drew my attention to the ground some-
where among the shadows were creatures such as barbara
and i had seen during the day

  with almost magical suddenness a dozen or more ether-
eal shapes were revealed all moving silently on their rub-
bery flippers emitting as they went the queer irregular
buzzing directly in front of my position about twenty
yards away they all stopped as if by command

  on the point of crawling out for a closer inspection i
was petrified momentarily by the appearance of a far
more fearsome visitation that rose out of the purple dark-
ness not far from the motionless monsters patently it
was a man yet such a shadowy grotesque caricature of
a man that i was almost convinced of his super-mundane
origin

  the man-like figure was stealing toward the shapes that
first had attracted me as if they were his prey at a lit-
tle distance from them he suddenly dropped to his hands
and knees while from his lips issued an imitation of the
sound which the other creatures had been making though
they were now ominously silent

  slowly the flying creatures swaying and wobbling on
their solitary legs began circling the crouching man
while they set up a buzzing not unlike the noise in a tele-
graph office with no apparent warning they closed in
as if to overcome the enemy by sheer weight of numbers
there was a muffled sound of blows an angry outburst of
buzzing then the winged monsters of the planetoid scat-
tered to right and left as the giant figure of the man rose
triumphantly in their midst

  low throaty laughter apprised me that the victor in the
strange duel had been no other than mad bjornsen he
had removed his space suit i saw as he came bounding
toward the rocket ship his massive blonde head and
hulking shoulders were oddly malformed by the purple
shadows in fact he was a far more fearful spectre than
the alien beings he had struggled with

  whos there he called out sharply seeing my dim
face in the broken port

  monte harbin i replied with bated breath for
gods sake what have you been doing

  he walked up to me and i swear his face had devel-
oped the assymmetry of a fiend

  dont be alarmed he chuckled i was merely ex-
ercising my superiority over the other inhabitants of al-
dania

  the other inhabitants i faltered

  verily stay up-and get acquainted with the horse-

men of a new apocalypse ill be awake in one hour
and id better not find you asleep

  he laughed nastily as he dived into the control room
where i heard him rustling about a moment before all
was quiet again

  i pass over the details of those hours of mental tor-
ment that i endured after witnessing bjornsens awesome
battle with the sky-horses and his allusion to his super-
iority well i recalled his life philosophy that of the
right of dominance of the superman here he might
carry out his ideals by forcing all manner of unpleasant-
ness upon us and there was barbara to complicate
matters

  the coming of the red dawn did not relieve my sus-
pense but rather heightened it as the survivors crawled
out of the wrecked ship to gaze upon the alien wonders
of the new world little was said that morning until af-
ter we had eaten or rather had taken our medicine mar-
mouth ignited a heat-cartridge taken from the lining of
his space-suit and we steeped the food tablets in water
bjornsen seemed highly amused by our greedy gulping
of the concoction and we were not long in learning why
he drank so sparingly of it when our stomachs promptly
and violently turned inside out

  hyper-sensitivity of contracted stomach walls bjorn-
sen -diagnosed our malady for three scientists on the
verge of eternity you wear the cap and bells very be-
comingly

  such callous amusement at our distress was enough to
set off clyde marmouth the english physicist whose tem-
per was only exceeded by the redness of his hair he
growled a sullen retort that did not please our captain

	bjornsens amber eyes hardened he seemed to draw
himself together like a tensed steel spring hold your
tongue marmouth he snapped what i have to say is
exempt from censure in this quarter of the universe by
right of brain and fist there isnt any police force or
standing army between you and me now

  barbara and i exchanged glances and i tried to catch
marmouths eyes with a silent warning before the
aroused englishman could speak again barbara had en-
deavored to relieve the situation with a pleasantry con-
cerning our petty bickerings as appropriate for marooned
space explorers

  but mad bjornsen was not to be placated

  wonders are relative he turned slyly to barbara
after what weve seen the miracles of infinity become
the proverbial duck-weed on the river when intellectual
ambition is sated we return to more primal ambitions to
personal prowess cabbages and women

  but i dont wish to be considered a woman barbara
parried good naturedly ive taken my punishment like
a man and i want to play the part of a man until the relief
ship arrives

  bjornsen tipped back his great head and laughed loud-
ly it was not a comforting sound and his explanation
for his pessimistic stand was distressing

  this pinch of cosmic dust is not even visible from
earth he declared moreover its invisible two mil-
lion miles this side of earth besides were moving in
orbit before herbert aldane is afloat well be ten mil-
lion miles from the location we cosmographed
tyrant of the red world



  a bloody rotten place to spend the rest of ones days
marmouth sulked

  bjornsen had risen quietly to his feet towering over us
like a demi-god there was a look of grim determination
on his bearded face

  none of you seems to appreciate this little fairyland
of the solar system he announced abruptly i feel
obliged to take possession lest we flout the kindness of the
gods consider yourselves subject to my will from now
on

  his eyes slowly traveled from face to face as he studied
our ominous silence there seemed utter contempt in his
voice as he concluded

  make your resistance as brief and decisive as possible

  marmouth was first on liis feet pistol drawn while
barbara and i quickly supported him but with three
deadly weapons staring him in the face mad bjornsen still
maintained his trance-like immobility

  well posed he sneered for three who hold something
in their hands that might make a few dents if thrown
hard enough

  marmouth and i must have faltered almost simul-
taneously pointing my weapon to one side i squeezed
the trigger there was no report with sickening dread
i noticed that the trigger moved sluggishly as if clogged
with dust or rust marmouth also had failed to fire his
pistol while barbara was looking fascinatedly at hers
rubbing the steel with a sensitive fingertip

  what have you done to these pistols marmouth cried
out furiously

  that question could only be answered by the one who
made this little watering place for space sailors grinned
bjornsen

  but barbara had made a discovery

  look she cried suddenly 

  we closed in oblivious to mad bjornsen in the horror
of an undreamed of menace barbara was pointing to her
pistol staring at it as if mesmerized

  a kind of verdigris she whispered no metal can
exist in this atmosphere

  the appalling truth unhinged me for a moment i
swung on bjornsen

  you knew this i accused

  i take advantage of natural phenomena he retorted
then to all are you satisfied or must i subdue you with
brawn as well as brain

  no one answered we were too confused to speak and
to attack him barehanded would have been madness

  very well he resumed confidently i think you
have done all you can for the present now ill tell you
something more about  i discovered the signs of it
last night this verdigris as miss weyden terms it has
saturated the entire ship inside and out it is a kind of
actinic rot a disintegration of metallic atomicity in con-
junction with light rays my investigations made while
you slept lead me to believe that not a trace of metal as
we know it exists on the surface of this planetoid

  at the rate of decomposition now going on in the plates
of the arthane she will be a heap of dust within a month
furthermore the relief ship that iajyis here or cruises
for very long in this atmosphere will not be able to get out
again now you may understand why ive staked my
future in aldane world we are here for life and i re-

peat that from now on to you as well as the sky life of
this world i am god

  traitor gasped barbara stupefied by the enormity
of his insinuations

   youll regret this if its the last act i do in life vowed
marmouth and  mumbled some echoing sentiment which
i have since forgotten

  meanwhile mad bjornsen smiled indulgently were
going bathing in the prettiest little cove you ever laid
eyes on you see my kingship isnt going to be entirely
painful the rub will be that you play with my per-
mission that you live with my brain and your legs oh
youll live all right because you hope to be rescued or to
kill me as to how you shall live well take that up later
lead on to that water we found yesterday marmouth and
quit that grouching it wont get you anywhere under
serge the first

            chapter v
            the revolt

	the first few days of our involuntary servitude to serge

  bjornsen interplanetary conquistador were disappoint-
ing as to social innovation and encouraging as prognosti-
cations for the future competently directed by our ego-
maniacal captain we began investigations much as if noth-
ing had happened to alter our relations however we
could do nothing without bjornsens approval not even
eat the penalty for disobedience being confiscation of
our food cases

  by noon of the first long day on the planetoid we had
removed the telescope and gearings from the observa-
tion room in the hope of somehow preserving the mech-
anism from the destructive atmosphere but our work
was useless the lenses already had been ruined by the
tiny webworks of the mysterious  by this time
even the buttons on our clothes had been affected nor
did mad bjornsen permit any experimental steps in coun-
teracting the decay he seemed to require nothing earth-
ly for promoting his schemes

  as deduced from the crude calculations possible with-
out instruments we discovered that we had landed some-
where in the torrid zone of the planetoid we estimated
that the daylight lasted almost twenty hours the night
being about equal at that season a temperature aver-
aging seventy degrees fahrenheit prevailed

  there was no wind in the surface layers of atmosphere
and the only perceptible clouds were so high as to be al-
most always invisible the small inertial mass explained
the rarity of air aldane world being somewhere between
earth and moon in size though i believe its atomic weight
was far greater owing to the presence of  in the soil

  since  a stellar body had been mathematically
located between earth and venus however so irregular
had its orbit been that nothing definite had been known
concerning it also the low reflective quality of the at-
mosphere had made it invisible to the telescopes we all
believed it was this body on which we had fallen

  an ideal world was mad bjornsens confident de-
claration we need only find food to take the place of
the food tablets when they are gone and as a last resort
we may be almost certain that a dissection of the sky-
horses will reveal something edible


wonder stories for august 

  the rest of the day was spent in an unsuccessful search
for more of the sky-horses we did not see any of
them but found many signs in the numerous entrances to
the caverns that seemed to honeycomb the vicinity we
decided that the animals were either nocturnal in their
habits or else were afraid to come out because of our
presence though we had confidently expectej to find
other forms of life the nearest we came to it was when
we unearthed some very weird fossils even the water
was devoid of any life that was visible to the naked eye

  that night we were briefly overjoyed when we discovered
a moon in the purple sky just what planet or satel-
lite the pale pink disc was we could not decide but it
was a cheering reminder of our own moon of faraway
earth

  not long after our discovery of the moon we were seated
in the control room of the rocket ship discussing the sit-
uation when the shadowy head and shoulders of mad
bjornsen loomed up in the broken porthole

  what do you want i asked with more boldness than
i felt

  just dropped in to pay my respects to the citizens of
aldane world he chuckled

  respects sniffed barbara

  or what have you he shrugged but enough of this
im bringing you company tonight

  company we chorused

  yes a couple of sky-horses or more properly sky-
colts im reasonably certain that these apparently-stupid
creatures have a language-a code language if you please
and i want to incite them into using it under observation

  we were incredulous

  oh nothing positive he disparaged but ive de-
tected what i believe to be a delicate differentiation in the
sounds they make with their antennae  want you to lis-
ten at close range and see if you can associate any of these
buzzing sounds with exterior conditions you might even
get them to conspire with you against serge the first

  his irony was lost on us the idea that the sky-horses
could communicate was stunning the scent of a scientific
discovery outweighing our personal grievances

  two hours later we were plunged into an absorbing in-
vestigation calling from the darkness where the strange
buzzing of the aldanians could be heard mad bjornsen
ordered us outside as we lined up not far from the en-
trance to the ship we could see the prismatic shapes of
two creatures under either of his arms while behind him
wobbled a surging mob flapping their great wings and
filling the air with crackling messages

  there seemed a likelihood of the creatures closing in on
us but bjornsen did not give them time as he quickly
deposited his burdens inside the broken window and dis-
appeared with a tremendous bound

  we tumbled back into the control room none too soon
outside the sky-horses beat and scratched at the fuselage
with their wings tfying to get at their captured young
but since our prisoners made no loud complaint the dis-
turbance soon quietly down to a desultory buzzing

  in the dull glow of an ignited heat-cartridge the two
weirdly beautiful beings were lying where bjornsen had
dropped them it was our first really close look at them
for mad bjornsen had forbidden us any night adven- 
tures

	the two were almost the same size-infants i assumed

  about as large as full-grown seals the tail consisted of
a tough horn-rimmed flipper shaped like an inverted
cornucopia this served to propel them on the ground
and in the air it was spread out to resemble a birds tail
acting as a flight stabilizer the wings were similar to a
birds only in their compactness when folded which en-
abled them to move easily in their underground habita-
tions organs similar to gills were hidden under the
translucent membranes near the head

  it looks to me as if they existed on air said barbara

  and a close examination of the gills seemed to bear
out her theory for there were none of the usual orifices
connected with a digestive system we did not doubt that
the alien element in the atmosphere had had something to
do with their development if it was not entirely respon-
sible

  the inadvertent slipping of my fingers as i turned one
of them over aroused us to disturbing evidence of their in-
telligence as i regained my grip with a jerk the cap-
tive vibrated his antennae angrily his buzzing was an-
swered instantly by the crowd outside repeating the ex-
periment several times we decided beyond the shadow of
a doubt that the sky-horses had a communicative system
of some kind probably similar to telegraphy relative
to this it was scarcely a pleasant feeling to realize that
the apparently unreasoning sky-horses might be studying
us more deeply than we studied them

  for an hour or more we experimented with the crea-
tures discovering that the light of the heat-cartridges
blinded them but that they were conscious of our presence
in either light or dark signifying an exceedingly mystify-
ing group of senses alien to our own at least in their
functioning or brain interpretation how they could see
at all was not clear but we guessed that the optical organs
were imbedded in the translucent membranes

  near midnight which time we could tell by the posi-
tion of the stars the buzzing of the sky-horses surround-
ing the ship apprized us of mad bjornsens return he
strode boldly up to the conning port shoving aside the
winged giants in his path as if they had been so many
court fools before his august majestys throne

  find out anything he asked

  marmouth volunteered to reply controlling his tem-
per in a manner hardly characteristic of him

  for some time we discussed the aldanians relative to
their intelligence and their day blindness which seemed
to explain why they retreated into the caves or cata-
sombs as bjornsen called them at the break of dawn
however we recalled seeing several of them just after
landing whereas thereafter we had seen but one in day-
light this seemed to show that they either had known
of our coming and were out to see us against their usual
habits or they had become frightened and would no long-
er show themselves except when their visual senses were
undimmed by sunlight the idea that the ones we had
seen in the daylight were spies and special messengers
on perilous night duty was an interesting one

  however our conference with bjornsen never got be-
yond the formal so far as we were concerned it was an
exchange of information valuable alike to tyrant and op-
pressed when serge the first returned to his royal
couch somewhere in the purple darkness our chilly good
tyrant of the red world



nights revealed the animosity smoldering beneath the
overtones of intellectual amity

  clyde marmouth the irascible englishman had sworn
to kill or be killed when he struck back at mad bjorn-
sen but it was the last part of that famous battle cry
of the bayonet which applied itself

  the incident of his tragic attempt to overcome the mad
swede came several days after the burial of our dead in
the little valley beside the wrecked rocket ship we had
gone to the lake or lagoon a quarter mile from the ar-
thane for our morning dip-a luxury encouraged by our
superman master since it hat a rapidly recuperative effect
bjornsen had not accompanied us that morning and we
were enjoying our brief freedom in a heart-to-heart dis-
cussion of our dilemma

  lacking bathing suits or material to make any we were
wearing our specially designed chamois underwear our
outer clothes lying in three neat piles at the edge of the
polyp forest behind us not until we were ready to dress
did we discover that our clothes had vanished

  bjornsen marmouth cried as we rushed to the spot
finding not so much as a pair of socks left us by the tliief

  barbara and i said nothing as we peered suspiciously
into the shadowy aisles of the coral labyrinth not doubt-
ing that thence our precious apparel had vanished and
not at the hands of the sky-horses to be sure

  upon examining the soft soil we found the faint im-
pressions of broad feet-mad bjornsens trail as it ap-
peared on aldane world where he weighed considerably
less than his earth weight

  this may be his idea of a good joke i said

  dont worry he isnt that crude declared barbara
we might have expected this dont you remember
he believes clothing unnecessary for variable tempera-
tures and to protect the skin from injury

  and here we have perennial summer and such light
gravity that we could fall off a house without barking a
shin added marmouth tartly

  under less sinsister circumstances the situation would
have been amusing as it was we felt that the confisca-
tion of our clothes only signified more radical innova-
tions and i suggested that we return to the space ship
in the hope that our space suits would be found in the
control room as we had left them

  i could sense marmouths suppressed rage as we set
out for the arthane the incensed young englishman
was several leaps ahead when we at last panted up to die
mold-covered space ship finding as we had feared that
the space suits also had been taken

  his best stroke yet grated marmouth with the
suits he has taken the cases of food we must look to
him for rations but not long- the implication was
plain

  be careful i exhorted kits not a question of cour-
age but of being certain he might kill you and me but
barbara-

 mad bjornsens thunderous voice interrupted us he

  had appeared suddenly from some nearby hiding place
and at his orders we climbed morosely out of the control
room

  we found him clad only in his chamois undergarment
exactly like ours he was a figure that would have been
godlike were it not for the merciless spirit lurking within

  my material could have been woree he commented
looking us over

  would you mind informing us the meaning of this
outrage demanded marmouth belligerently

  not at all rasped bjornsen you are in good
enough condition to begin training your clothing was
needless interference and so i destroyed it by the quickest
and easiest means at my disposal as your remaining ap-
parel wears out you will become accustomed to living in
the nude and i trust sufficiently deified so that it will
mean nothing to you from the moral standpoint

  talking like an automaton he outlined his plans for
us and the superman realm he was to organize we were
that day to begin a system of physical and mental exer-
cises calculated to increase our vigor one hundred per
cent under the gravitational conditions and with the diet
and rest periods he prescribed we would alternate the
physical work with sessions of emotional adjustments
holding that imperfectly controlled emotions were the
chief weakness of earthman he intended to destroy all
emotions and sentiment in us

  when  am finished he concludcd if you are still
alive you will retain only intellectual reactions in short
you shall be as near to gods as it is possible to make
you after your pre-adjustment to earth standards

  you are mad exclaimed barbara

  but there is method in my madness to quote hamlet
he rejoined unmoved besides the state of my sanity
doesnt alter the circumstances here the individual shall
reign and his only law shall be his impulses inciden-
tally my impulses will govern yours until you are able to
direct yourselves according to the new standards

  and if your impulses destroy us where will you be
i put in desperately

  then i will marry the queen of the sky-horses
  what

  my night adventures havent been wasted he said in
a low sinister tone beings undreamed of sleep beneath
the surface of this world and you had best not attempt
entering the catacombs in my absence

  you are bluffing marmouth growled

  bjornsen said no more as his manner changed from
cold indifference to grim resolution

  follow me he roared at us leaping to the top of the
wrecked ship his great muscles tensed eyes dominating
and challenging

  silently we obeyed a cross-country run ensued which
brought us back to the arthane utterly exhausted we
were permitted to rest and bathe then food tablets were
doled out from the consfiscated stores and again we were
lined up before the ship this time we were commanded
to curse our tutor to the top of our voices and to continue
the maledictions until our throats were too hoarse to croak

  resolved to be amazed at nothing we complied while
bjornsen laughed at us threw stones at us we pronounced
epithets until our vocabularies were exhausted in that field

  you may rest he ended the orgy at his own caprice
you are now in the first stage of greatness which ac-
cording to nietzsche is the lion roaring in the wilder-
ness soon you will become the burden-bearing camel
and last of all if you survive will come the humility of
an ipfant and success

  it was then that clyde marmouth threw a stone with
all his remaining strength bjornsen caught it and


wonder stories for august 

threw it back with such force that it smashed against
the wall of the ship stinging us with flying fragments
as i cried out for marmouth to contain himself bjornsen
lunged among us kicking striking the last i knew wa
that i attempted to kick him with one bare foot and re-
ceived a stunning hurt on both head and foot

  we were in the control room stretched out like corpses
when marmouth revived me later

  i couldnt stand it any longer he groaned through
puffed lips

  but weve got to i replied groggily holding my
aching head he wont kill us hell do worse

  tonight hissed marmouth ill find where he
sleeps so help me ill-

  youll do nothing of the sort i rebuked bjornrsen
was right when he once said you were the biggest fool
in the crew

  coward he snarled at me and strangely i did not
feel at all insulted as i crawlcd to barbaras side to find
her dully awake

  our only chance is to escape before its too late she
moaned	s

  but we must have food theres no use taking fool-
ish chances so long as we have hopes of the relief ship
reaching us they may be able to take care of bjorn-
sen

  hours afterward in the purple darkness i awakened
in great pain barbara was asleep near by but  could
not find marmouth recalling his oath of speedy ven-
geance i did not doubt that the doughty englishman was
somewhere in the wilds of the planetoid looking for mad
bjornsen like don quixote on a mission of demented
chivalry

  awakening as a result of my movements barbara
waited with me for marmouths return it was a watch
destined never to end with its object attained the spirited
englishman met his death that night somewhere in the
maze of caverns where the sky-horses hid at night and
where mad bjornsen sfcpt secure from the wrath of his
human playthings

chapter vi
pegasus to the rescue

	mad bjornsen never mentioned the disappearance of

  marmouth but somehow we believed that he had had
plenty to do with it for he always evaded any direct in-
quiries meanwhile the strenuous training went on bar-
bara weyden and i the only understudies of the self-
styled superman

  by the time the arthane began to cave in from the in-
roads of  we had become virtually tireless and so rugged
physically that we could catch a limestone boulder on
the abdomen and bounce it back to the one who had
hurled it the light gravitation was of course respon-
sible for our remarkable feats of strength and agility
though we could not have reached such extremities with-
out intensive training

  our feet became as calloused as if we had gone bare-
footed all our lives lungs expanded with amazing
rapidity owing to incessant deep breathing which was in-
voluntary even in sleep because of the rare atmosphere
when we were forced to move out of the crumbling ruins

of the rocket ship lest it fall in on as at night our only
remaining belongings were the tattered chamois under-
wear all mechanical apparatus had been completely
ruined not even a heat cartridge left to cheer us during
the endless purple nights that camc between the seeming
eternities of the hectic days only a huge ground- sign
made of bits of coral imbedded in the limestone remained
to testify that any such engine as the arlhane ever had
visited the planetoid this sign was also the marker of
our fellows graves and read her-e they lie though we
hardly expected that the eyes of earthmen would lay eyes
on it with the exception of ourselves

  on the eastern shore of consolation bay as we had
come to call the lake nearest us we made our new base of
operations under the supervision of serge the first our
only need for dwellings in that mild climate was for pro-
tection against the nightly depredations of the sky-norses
to prevent them attacking while we- slept we erected
thick-walled huts of limestone that looked like brick
kilns against these miniature fortresses the strange in-
habitants of the planetoid would sometimes drum their
great wings with a noise like thunder but that was be-
fore we made friends wilh them and they discovered with
their mysterious intelligence that we too were victims
of the man-master from a distant world

  as the days passed days of torment and strain both
physical and mental i became more and more possessed
with a terrifying suspicion namely that mad bjornsen
intended driving me to suicide after which he would be-
come the adam of his super-race and barbara weyden
his eve i had no actual evidence of this yet i could
not otherwise explain the tedious routine of training he
subjected us to he would make of barbara an ama-
zon of strength an emotionless robot of life using me as a
pawn to be destroyed as soon as i had served my purpose
of encouraging her over the critical period of transition

  knowing that he might kill me upon the slightest pro-
vocation now that i was becoming less and less necessary
to his plans i was resolved upon the utmost caution as-
suming docility and indifference while in reality await-
ing an advantageous situation the idea of taking a hu-
man life no longer appalled me in that respect i had
become a graduate of mad bjornsens curriculum

  a month dragged by two months almost by earth reck-
oning it seemed an age earth and its gentler civiliza-
tion became misty dreams whose reality faded with the
disintegration of the arthane beside the graves of those
who seemed more fortunate than we we clung precar-
iously to sanity and hope living like deified troglodytes in
our boulder-walled huts by the shores of consolation bay

  but only our iron-hard muscles were consoled by the
seething waters of the planetoid our rage hung to us
like specters of the human beings we once had been and
as mad bjornsen said it did not take us long to reach the
stage of the camel in the evolution of true nietszchean
greatness indeed we did bear our burdens uncomplain-
ingly but what mad bjornsen did not consider in his hell-
ish schemes was that we were in love love burned on in
our hearts one weakness too deeply seated for our luci-
fer to eradicate with his merciless program of physical
violence and spiritual mayhem

  barbara decorated the inside of her private citadel with
bits of coral and fossilized shells until it resembled a
miniature museum to me that bric-a-brac was a pitiful
tyrant of the red world



reminder of how she mourned the passing of more peace-
ful days of how determinedly she adhered to the ideals of
her previous life

  her hut was sanctuary for me with beard trimmed
meticulously on the edge of a sharp stone i would enter
her house with exaggerated formality and courtesy kissing
her hand with a gallantry that would have won me a
cuff and an imprecation if mad bjornsen had seen it

  i became more and more miladys knight-errant in spite
of bjornsens mechanizing brutalizing processes alone
with barbara in dark or light we whispered endearments
and sympathies with voices harsh from the hours of roar-
ing that were demanded of us in the emotional adjust-
ments-those maddening periods of the day when the
repetition of feelingless epigrams or phrases drove and
drove into the subconscious toward one end be hard
be hard

  slowly but surely we learned the principles of the sky-
horses telegraphy at first we succeeded only in con-
veying to them that we meant them no harm but after
that we progressed by leaps and bounds since contacts
were much easier obtained and longer protracted soon
the spectral yet beautiful sky-horses or air-lions as we
sometimes called them were gathering about us nightly
answering our awkward rat-a-tat-tat made by striking
stones together with repeated signals that were in most
instances uninterpretable

	there was one large aldanian in particular who seemed

  to understand our plight better than the others he
seemed a sort of nabob or patriarch among his kind he
reminded me of an angel sometimes but more often be-
cause of his size he looked like a flying horse of myth-
ology his huge wings transparent and rainbow-hued
were nearly forty feet from tip to tip when he oscillated
his antennae near ones ear the sound was like the drum-
ming of a hundred woodpeckers it was chiefly through
the intelligence of this giant sky-horse that we were able to
piece together a crude code alphabet and master the
simpler expressions used by the strange denizens of the
new world

  lets call him pegasus suggested barbara and pega-
sus we called him ever afterward

  we could have advanced much more rapidly in our
understanding of pegasus and his spectral herd if there
had been any light at night especially we might have
been able to discover an indigent food before we did as
it was mad bjornsen kept us from doing much investiga-
ting during the day and the sky-horses were unable to un-
derstand what we meant by food there being nothing simi-
lar in their vocabulary that we were able to discover air
was their substitute for food and many a time barbara
and i wished we were able to live on that ethereal sub-
stance which is proverbially associated with poor newly-
weds

  it was pegasus who told us about the catacombs or
caves that led down into the bowels of the planetoid from
the holes in the surface in these phosphorous-lighted
grottos the sky-horses made their homes by day near the
mysterious queens and in one of these innumerable
chambers mad bjornsen passed the long nights safe from
the avenging clutches of his super-slaves

  the culmination of our plans to escape from the op-
pressions of our mad captain came as a result of his sud-

den and at first mysterious absence six months after our
marooning on aldane world serge the first made the
greatest mistake in his career as a world conquistador when
he dissected one of the sky-horses in search of biological
data

  pegasus informed us of the outrage as the crime
appeared to be in the intelligences of the sky-horses it
transpired that by the unknown sense or senses that the
aldanians seemed to possess they were almost simultan-
eously apprised of the offense exactly when or how it
happened we never learned but there was no question as
to the indignation of the sky-horses when pegasus flew
up alone through the purple glow of twilight we could
not misinterpret his angry buzzing

  no other sky-horscs were in sight or hearing at the
time having concentrated underground according to our
giant friends reports once we heard the cyclonic sound
made by a large number flying south across the bay but
they did not come near us and their passage was further
proof that mad bjornsen was not in the vicinity

  by midnight we were certain that serge the first had
his hands full of trouble and when barbara went to her
hut for a nap we had strong hopes that fortune was at
last smiling on us yet as i sat up alone on the first
watch i could not escape the contradictions of the situa-
tion if mad bjornsen were killed by the aldanians we
would be left without food since the secret of the place
where he kept the tablets would die with him only the
unpleasant alternative of eating the sky-horses would
remain unless by some unexpected miracle we stumbled
upon some form of vegetable or animal life underground

  but barbaras cheerfulness encouraged me when she
relieved me a few hours before dawn i took to my
couch of dust resolved that even starvation was preferable
to prolonged subjugation to the will of mad bjornsen

  the mauve light of sunrise on the plantoid awakened
me barbara still was on watch and we exchanged good
cheer at the continued absence of mad bjornsen who in-
variably routed us out at that hour after a plunge in
the bay and a breakfast of phosphoric water we returned
to the huts to lay our plans for the future

  by noon there no longer was any doubt in our minds
that something serious had happened to our oppressor
our chances to escape had surely come and it did not
behoove us to be squeamish concerning the only available
food

  if this had happened three months ago i wouldnt
have been satisfied until i had tracked him down and
made sure he was dead i told barbara while we scanned
the enchanted landscape from a knoll above the huts
now ive got to admit that hes made life livable on al-
dane world without the endurance he forced on me in
training id be a poor excuse of an interplanetarian

  i agree with you monte rejoined barbara but we
couldnt wish him worse than he seems to have brought on
himself anyway weve got to get away and far away
before he is able to look for us if we get too hungry
theres always the sky-horses though the mere idea of
eating one makes me feel like a cannibal

  and a dyspeptic i added

 the catacombs remain to be explored for food
though barbara went on optimistically and we can
depend on pegasus to show us around underground you
know i have a notion that bjornsen knew of some kind


wonder stories for august 

of food down there which he didnt tell us about for fear
wed run away from him and his precious food cases
all the rest of the afternoon we chafed in idleness wait-
ing for the falling of darkness and the coming of our
giant sky-horse friend who had left us at dawn as usual
never was a ten-hour afternoon as long as that with
every slightest sound we stared nervously fearing to see
the herculean figure of mad bjornsen soaring into view
with the tremendous bounds by which he traveled on al-
dane world coming to wreck our fine plans of escape

  night came at last and with it pegasus voluble with
news of our oppressor which we were unable to under-
stand for the most part pegasus was more than willing
to carry us as far as we wished to go and when we made
clear our plans he was impatient to be off delaying no
longer we crawled between the mighty wings of the inter -
planetarian and were borne up and away from the scene
of our bondage into the unknown darkness of the plane-
toid

 flying steadily westward we covered a distance of
many miles before the sunrise painted the alien sky
with crimson and violet pegasus needed no urging to
seek the caverns where we intended hiding until darkness
came again meanwhile searching for something edible
which was more attractive than sky-horse steak and phos-
phoric water

  soon we were lost in darkness under the massive foun-
dations of the polyp forests with imaginations conjur-
ing visions of the dread sky-horse queens it was not a
pleasureable adventure and it proved conclusively that
mad bjornsen had not succeeded in immunizing us to fear
sensations only the reassuring tr-r-rt tr-r-rt of our
strange guide and steed allayed our forebodings as we
were led deeper and deeper into the substratum of the
new world

  at length the damp walls began to glow with spots
and streaks of phosphorous indicating water not far
ahead we entered a large oblong chamber that liter-
ally flamed with lurid luminesence here pegasus lurched
to a stop and we slid to the ground

  aladdins cave barbara said awed as we began ex-
amining the walls of the subterranean room with every
stone alive with phosphorous one had the impression of
exploring the inside of an enormous furnace

   better than playing superman for mad bjornsen
barbara cheered me

  i dont know i replied dubiously i almost wish
i were back at the bay when i think of the food tablets
this is the first time my mouth has actually watered for
such medicinal powder

  and im working up an appetite for something far
worse than food tablets laughed barbara i could al-
most devour a large slice of our friend pegasus

  purely in fun she seized the edge of one monstrous
wing and made as if to bite out a piece no sooner bad
she neared the tissue with her teeth than pegasus gave a
tremendous start flapping his wings as if to blow us
down barbara staggered back to my side and together
we stared at the apparently enraged aldanian

  a loud rat-tat-tat of antennae followed pegasus exhi-
bition of displeasure what he conveyed was electrify-
ing we had at last succeeded in communicating him
our need for food

  motion pegasus telegraphed a moment later and
scarcely daring to hope that the faithful creature com-
pletely comprehended our need we followed him to
the passage by which we had entered the subterranean
chamber

  like some monstrous deified seal the great sky-horse
floundered up the gentle grade to a point where the walls
began to dry oft somewhat and show only sparse splotches
of luminous moisture just at the deeper darkness of
the upper galleries he stopped and emitted a sharp tr-t-t
tr-t-t meaning look here

  eagerly we dropped to hands and knees we did not
need to look far at the foot of the wall we found the
first traces-nodules of an excrescence resembling certain
kinds of mold on earth

  food i cried out the importunate word filling my
hands with the stuff

  barbara already had tasted it and her exclamation of
astonishment was not unmingled with pleasure

  the manna of aldane world tasted somewhat like
wild honey though there was a less pleasing tang of phos-
phorous but what was more important than flavor the
deposit seemed rich in protein and vitamines

  we had not hoped to find such a satisfactory substi-
tute for the scientific food tablets and it was a team of
doubting thomases that looked further for signs of  h -
deposits the stuff grew in patches here and there ex-
tending over a section of the passage more than thirty
paces long easy to find once we had been led to it

  pegasus had gone back to the brightly-lighted chamber
during our celebration of the discovery of natural food
on aldane world with our hands full of the godsend
we followed half an hour later having experienced no
ill-effects from the small portions we had eaten we ate
our fill of lie strange provender wishing we had sufficient
vocabulary to thank pegasus for his favor

  what shall we name it barbara wanted to know

  i suggested fairy foam and several other fanciful
terms but barbara was a realist

  why not glow wax she suggested it has the con-
sistency of wax and it shines in the dark

  being flltra-modern we believed in short cuts in term-
inology and glow wax quickly became giox by which
name this curious and invaluable food still is known on
terra firma

  taking turns on watch for the possible appearance of
mad bjornsen we passed the rest of the period of day-
light underground and were called to attention by pega-
sus at the fall of evening which he could sense as if by
a photoelectric radioactive intelligence

  once more on the surface we filled our lungs with the
bracing air of the red world and shrouded by the purple
darkness from any danger of bjornsen sighting us we
climbed aboard our living monoplane

chapter vii
w aterloo

	we must have been more than three hundred miles

  from consolation bay before we began to look for a
place to settle down the terrain had not changed the
glowing pools or lagoons were as numerous as ever
once we had decided that it was safe to be abroad by
tyrant of the red world



day and to leave our footprints on the surface we spent
many hours in the water swimming diving and splash-
ing like children on a vacation especially did the water
splashing amuse us since the showers of drops fell so
slowly with little effort we could create the most beau-
tiful fountains

  a week after our departure from consolation bay we
were nearly five hundred miles from mad bjornsen s
stamping grounds by our estimation of distance we
were beginning to forget that there ever had been a threat
of superman vengeance hanging over us such a sense
of freedom and well being i had never thought possible
to experience among the petrified horrors of aldane
world and i was satisfied that love was at the bottom
of it all

  then we reached the promised land as we promptly
named it we had been absent from consolation bay al-
most a month by earth reckoning pegasus had remained
with us even while we traveled on foot he had just
come out of his diurnal hiding when at twilight we broke
out of a coral thicket more than thirty feet high and saw
the glimmering expanse of a large lake before us we
had been wandering in that vicinity for hours without
seeing the lake so restricted was our perspective on the
planetoid due to atmosphere and surface contours

  here is where we pitch our stony tents i sang out
jubilantly and barbara was in enthusiastic agreement

  at evening the scene was one of striking beauty with
the varicolored polyps growing down to the mirror edge
of the phosphorescent water which glowed like burnished
gold the moment the daylight began to dim we gazed
in enchantment upon the fantastical colors until it was
too dark to see

  but we did not fully appreciate the promised land un-
til next morning when wte emerged from the mouth of a
cavern on the north side of the lake treasure lake
which we had decided upon as a name the evening before
was nearly a mile wide and under the wine-hued morn-
ing sun it sparkled like an ocean of rubies

  barbara raced me down the shell-lodged beach over
which no human foot had trod before us and into the
mirror-like water we plunged swimming halfway around
the wild shorelines before we returned to the beach to con-
sider a site for our dwellings

  i pass over the days that followed those who have
engaged in the first months of courtship may understand
the ecstatic happiness of two who have only themselves
nnd love days became weeks and weeks months while
our feeling of security that we had eluded mad bjornsen
for good or else that he had been killed by the sky-horses
became almost a certainty

  but our time was not wholly spent in courtship and
play there were serious intervals and intellectual in-
tervals for instance when we discussed the possibilities
of herbert aldane reaching us with the relief ship we
were agreed that the relief crew would circumnavigate
the planetoid in search of a ground-sign and that we
would be able to hear the rocket tubes for a distance of
several hundred miles in such light windless atmosphere

  we built a ground-sign hoping mad bjornsen would
not be the first to see it it was an enormous project
six hundred yards long by two hundred wide it lay on the
lime-white beach printed in sidewalks of red coral the
word here in capital letters which we illuminated with

phosphorous for night visibility yet conspicuous as it
must have been from the air we knew that the relief crew
might not see it at the speed and altitude at which they
would be flying as they plunged out of the void

  its nearly a year now since herbert aldane notified us
that the relief ship was underway i reminded barbara
he ought to be afloat by this time i wonder if we can
keep our sanity when we hear the thunder of the tubes
yes-when we hear them she responded with less
enthusiasm and more honesty we have moved several
million miles in orbit besides they will need far more
fuel than we had unless a magnetic vortex happens to
pick them up

  i know i admitted lamely theres no use deceiving
ourselves with optimism and you havent said the half
of it they may be drawn into another body than aldane
world

  if something doesnt happen in the meteoric shpere
she summarized and we both had a good laugh at our
thorough pessimism while at the same time we knew that
herbert aldane would move heaven and earth to reach us

  meanwhile neither barbara nor i were greatly de-
pressed by the circumstances free of mad bjornsens
impositions even the idea of lifelong solitude did not dis-
may us

  but there came an interruption to our arcadian bliss
that morning we had swum to the southern shore of
treasure lake for a stroll in the polyp forest that crowded
the water there danger never was farther from our
minds than when we sat down for a tete-a-tete in an arbor-
like nook which we frequently visited

  barbara was saying but if the unknown sense of the
sky-horse is tension then radioactivity would-

  at that instant we heard a slight movement on the
mound behind us and a dim shadow dropped down across
our vision looming like the wings of satan we did not
turn at first barbaras facc was drained of blood while
i sat riveted to the stone in such fear that my legs were
numb

  o-ho called an unforgettable voice mocking and de-
risive babes in the woods without a guardian angel-
or a preacher

	then we leaped to our feet and turned to see him stand-
ing above us looking down with a look of triumph on
his face he too had made a loin cloth of his vanish-
ing chamois underwear and if semi-nudity had improved
our appearance it had almost deified his

  ah you need more training he called down you
are exhibiting fear

  well what are you going to do i found voice
permit your imaginations to torment you for a few
seconds he laughed

  please tell us how you found us barbara interpolated
the flatness of her voice expressing her resignation

  he spread his powerful hands in a gesture of disparge-
mcnt very simple he explained obligingly you
couldnt have gone north or south because of the cold
zones you wouldnt have gone east because of the graves
to pass psychology see so i started west and by lis-
tening to the code conversations of the aldanians i heard
about you and your champion pegasus after that it
was a mere matter of legs and eyes

  he was gazing at barbara now with that estimative


wonder stories for august 

probing which fell short of insolence by some indetermin-
able quality of his personality

  good morning good morning miss solemnity he
chafed her why the so animadversive mien

  it is inconsistent of you to wish me good morning
she replied tartly

  he jumped down from the boulders and sat down in-
solently on the natural bench we had quitted he seemed
remotely preoccupied about something and was running
his fingers across his chin and through his beard i not
iced a slight strain in the muscles around the eyes which i
laid to fatigue at the time

  sit down he finally directed us with a wave of one
hand i have bad news for you the sky-horses have
done for me

  barbara and i exchanged glances while bjornsen
laughed at our perplexity

  wondering how that could be bad news eh well
the truth is ive been poisoned by some means i cant
understand i got it from one of the queens i may be
wrong but i think im going to die pretty soon in fact
almost any time the attacks are something like epilepsy
i didnt come out of the last one for several hours he
seemed to be talkig to himself as much as to us-a kind
of detached reverie you know these creatures are more
like bees than horses he went on they have queens
that give birth to all the young the queens are self-fer-
tilizing and live on air like the sky-horses the first time
i saw one in a lower gallery of the caverns i thought it
was a gigantic amoeba well i found out different each
of these queens is the head of a clan or drove of sky-
horses when something happens to a sky-horse the queen
knows by some radioactive sense that we do not possess
that is why im here now on my last legs you see i cut
up a colt to see what made it tick

  his low laugh made me shudder as after a moment of
silence he continued of course my ambitions on aldane
world have been decidedly curtailed in fact the napo-
leon of interplanetary space has met his waterloo but
unfortunately this still is bad news for you you see i
have ambition in another field he laughed again and
this time at us we were listening to him as a judge
pronouncing sentence of death

  just what do you think i would do in this situation
he surprised us by asking my visions of an ideal so-
ciety on a new world are destroyed the skinny finger of
death is plucking at my shoulder i have maybe three
months to live maybe an hour

  i should say you ought to mend your ways and get
something like real happiness out of being reasonably kind
to your inferiors i said

  he considered a moment i thought he might be wait-
ing for barbara to speak but she did not presently he
said yes that is exactly what i could expect from you
already you assert what you hope is a stronger impulse
its really too bad that i still have impulses and dare to
think them stronger than yours

  we waited for him to go on and presently he did so
introspectively while his eyes took on an expression of
bewilderment as if he could not credit the menace of his
unconquerable strength

  it is the sky-horse queens that have exterminated every
other form of life on aldane world he said i under-
estimated theij- powers they could conquer the universe

with their strange senses but i should be proud to die
at the hands of a life-form superior to earthman

  he seemed to lose consciousness of our presence for a
moment and when he recovered from the lapse which 
associated with his illness he went on

  when i knew my dream of conquest was destroyed i
considered what small ambition might yet be realized
naturally i turned to something still in my power-
earthman earthwoman and my wish the law on aldane
world his next utterance came as an exploding bomb-
shell even though we must subconsciously have been an-
ticipating such now i intend to realize a repressed de-
sire since my higher ideals cannot be materialized i
turn to the lower and primal in these last months of
life i assert the primal privilege of the superior male

	his voice died away like a death-knell in the windless
stillness of the polyp forest we could say nothing
all of our-previous fears were substantiated by this revel-
ation of the beast that slumbered behind the intellectual
front of mad bjornsen and i knew then the acid bitter-
ness of incapability the sickening realization of my in-
feriority in every way to this monstrosity of man

  amused by our horror he looked at us unmoved dis-
passionate experimenting to the last with the souls in his
power

  but barbara could control her disgust and indignation
no longer

  you have at last become a fool serge bjornsen she
burst out and i think she regretted immediately that she
had lost her head

  mad bjornsen got quietly to his feet there was a
saturnine smile on his bearded lips

  you are going to have an opportunity to prove that
statement young lady he said then turned toward the
lake motioning us to follow just before we reached
the water he turned back and called to me

  a race with death harbin and the goal a womans
love great stuff to die on eh even better than walk-
ing on new worlds for the first time

  we had plenty of time to recover our senses during the
long swim back to the beach i had a rather groundless
fear that barbara might attempt to drown herself in her
horror of what bjornsen had suggested and i stayed close
by while our captor plowed off ahead occasionally turn-
ing over to his back as if to see that we did not strike
out on another coursc in an attempt to escape barbara
seemed too stunned to speak at first but the water revived
her and presently she called out to me in a low voice
hell try to hypnotize me he used to amuse himself
with hypnotism at aldane hangars

  hell not try it if i can kill him first i vowed

  the attacks he speaks of- she called back -if he
only has one we could get away before he recovered
or finish him while we had the chance i amended
careful hes dropping back to listen

  we swam on in silence as we overhauled him mad
bjornsen shouted over the water keep ahead of me and
get out of the water first none of your tricks or ill
drown both of you

  obediently we speeded up and as mad bjornsen
dropped behind we laid our plans the grourid-sign
was not far from the edge of the water and the huge
segments of coral composing it would furnish deadly
tyrant of the red world



missiles before he could get out of the water we re-
solved to bombard him with the heavy pieces of coral
knowing well that once he gained firm footing we would
stand little chance of overcoming him

  at first it seemed that our plans would work out as
intended assuming a dejected and submissive attitude
we splashed out of the water some distance ahead of bjorn-
sen starting for the ground-sign but something inad-
vertent in our actions must have aroused his suspicions
we heard a thunderous shout and whirled hack bjornsen
was lunging toward us over the water like a giant dol-
phin one look at that fierce visage was enough to send
us dashing madly for the ground-sign andthe coral

  but there proved no need for hostilities when we
looked hack at our aggressor he was struggling franti-
cally and futilely just beyond wading depth as if some-
thing had caught him from under water

  hes had an attack cried barbara

  his struggles grew rapidly weaker as we watched awe-
stricken at last he went down and when he came up
again his face was set in a ghastly deathmask as bar-
bara had divined he had apparently had been taken with
one of the fits

  i know of no other person whom we would not have
tried to rescue under the circumstances it was the only
death-bed we ever were to attend with exultation not
until he had gone down the last time did we enter the
water and then only after a long wait for his reappear-
ance

  after several minutes of diving we brought up the body
and towed it ashore even then we might have resuscitated
one in whom the life-flame burned so intensely but in-
stead we made certain that all life was extinct

  i cant believe we are free said barbara huskily
as we bent over the cold flesh that once had been the
mightiest engine of human life which earth could pro-
duce

  nor i i solemnly agreed he has met his match
at last but it had to be something more than human

  had we been forced to live the rest of our lives on
aldane world it is probable that we would have seen
one of the amebic masses which mad bjornsen had de-
scribed as the queens of the aldanians however it is
more likely that they would have destroyed us in some
miraculous manner as they had destroyed every other
form of life on the planetoid cxcept their own progeny

  but destiny had not decreed that the last of the ar-
thanes martyrs should become the adam and eve of a
new wtorld not quite four months after the burial of
mad bjornsen on the beach of treasure lake there came
a sign in the red heavens of our tiny world that was to
us like the eastern star to the wise men

  we had just come in from a long swim in treasure
lake and were sitting in the eerie-glow of the phoshorous-
coated ground-sign

  off in the southwest we heard it first-a low mourn-
ful whining that rose swiftly to a shriek like that of an
artillery projectile before we could arouse from stupe-
fying amazements a blast of thunder had crashed through
the thin atmosphere a blue wedge of gaseous flame flash-
ing across the southern firmament vanished like a meteor
or falling star

  they are circumnavigating us i managed to arti-

the

culate theyll cruise the daylight hemisphere looking
for signals of distress then theyll return to the night
side and see our ground-sign if they havent seen it al-
ready

  then a watch began which neither of us ever want to
repeat the idea that we must wait helplessly while the
relief ship traversed the daylight side of the planetoid
was agonizing three hours wore away midnight
came and at last we heard the returning thunder of the
rocket tubes holding our breaths in fear that they
would miss us again we saw that the crew was dropping
flares that lighted the polyp forest for miles around

  the thunder grew louder as the ship flew to a point
that seemed almost directly over us another flare burst
in the southwest and then the rocket exhausts pointed
straight down as the landing batteries went into action
they had seen the ground-sign

  stumbling and sliding between long aerial leaps we
headed for the flare near which the rocket ship had dis-
appeared over the curve of the planetoids surface min-
utes later-minutes that seemed hours-we sighted the
nucleus of the earth-light blazing not far ahead several
strange figures were looking toward us intently from a
mound within the circle of light they were earlhmen
in space-suits

   i became vaguely conscious of the general wildness of
our appearance as i caught the threatening glint of a pis-
tol barrel i raised my hand in the savage sign of peace
too stunned by rejoicing to speak

  a hand was raised in response and a human voice
rasped through an amplifying audio-valve transmitter

  in the name of god who are you

   earthians i swear i called back

   a cheer broke from the ranks of the rescuing party as
they leaped toward us we were surrounded by babbling
voices and curious glass eyes

   youve got to project again i managed to gasp out
this atmosphere will ruin the ship

  barbara had been sounding a similar warning to the
rest of the crew and in a moment we were hurrying to-
ward the edge of the light

  the relief ship loomed up before us in a deep draw
like a gigantic submarine on sea bottom many hands
crowded us into an airlock some one led us along a
dimly lighted service channel an air-tight door opened
we stumbled into a passenger compartment

   keep the door shut our guide shouted before he de-
parted you wont need space suits clothes in the
lockers

   somehow we got into a pair of flying suits before the
voice of herbert aldane sounded in the speaking tubes

  stand by for projection all hands in the shock
frames

  with the thunder of acceleration salvos informing us
that we were at last departing from the scene of our long
exile we recovered a measure of composure together
we stared into the reflectors of the observation periscopes

  far below we could see the glimmering lakes and bays
in their setting of purple gloom i thought i noticed a
larger blot of yellow that looked like treasure lake and
a wave of sadness almost homesickness came over me as
barbara buried her eyes in my shoulder

flight into super-time

 by clark ashton smith

	some who read this narrative will no doubt remember
the disappearance of the eccentric millionaire domi-
tian malgraff and his chinese servant li wong which
provided the newspapers of  with flamboyant head-
lines and many columns of rumor and speculation

   reams were written concerning the case but stripped
of all reportorial embellishments it can hardly have been
said to constitute a story there were no verifiable
motives nor explanatory circumstances no clues nor traces
of any kind the two men had passed from all mundane
knowledge between one hour and the next as if they had
evaporated like some of the queer volatile chemicals with
which malgraff had been experimenting in his private
laboratory no one knew the use of these chemicals
and no one knew what had happened to malgraff and li
wong

   few perhaps will consider that any reliable solution
of these problems is now afforded through the publica-
tion of the manuscript received by sylvia talbot a year
ago in the fall of 

   miss talbot had formerly been affianced to malgraff
but had broken off the engagement three years prior to
his disappearance she had been fond of him but his
dreamy disposition and impractical leanings had formed
a decided barrier from her viewpoint the youth had
seemed to take his dismissal lightly and had afterwards
plunged into scientific researches whose nature and ob-
ject he confided to no one but neither then nor at any
other time had he shown the least inclination to supple-
ment by his own efforts the huge fortune inherited from
his father	

   regarding his vanishment miss talbot was as much in
the dark as everyone else after the breaking-off of the
engagement she had continued to hear from him at inter-
vals but his letters had grown more and more infrequent
through his absorption in unnamed studies and labors
she was both surprised and shocked by ttie news of his
disappearance

   a world-wide search was made by his lawyers and rela-
tions but without result then in the late summer of
 the strange vessel containing the aforesaid manu-
script was found floating in the banda sea between cele-
bes and the spice islands by a dutch pearler

  the vessel was a sphere of some unknown crystalline
substance with flattened ends it was eighteen inches in
diameter and possessed an interior mechanism of minia-
ture dy namos and induction coils all of the same clear
material together with an apparatus resembling an hour-
glass which was half-filled with a grey powder the

      clark ashton smith refuses to be limited in
      his imagination by time and space he wishes
      to create a world in which both time and space
      are at our control and by scientific power we
      can be where and when we wish naturally
      in this story we must take his time-machine
      for granted we must allow him one assump-
      tion assume that such a machine were pos-
      sible then what would happen

         the happenings in this story may appear
      bizarre incredible fantastic but the universe
      is so vast and our knowledge of it is so insig-
      nificant that we must hesitate to pronounce any
      of his pictures as impossible we must take
      them as they are given as the creations of a
      really imaginative mind that longs for infinity

outer surface was studded with several tiny knobs in
the very center in a small cylindrical compartment was
a thick roll of greenish-yellow paper on which the name
and address of miss sylvia talbot were plainly legible
through the various layers of the sphere the writing
had been done with some sort of brush or an extremely
heavy pen in pigment of a rare shade of purple

  two months later the thing reached miss talbot who
was startled and amazed when she recognized the writing
as that of domitian malgraff

  after many vain experiments by manipulating certain
of the exterior knobs the vessel was opened and it came
apart in two hemispheric sections miss talbot found
that the roll of paper contained a voluminous letter from
malgraff written on yard-long sheets this letter with
the omission of a few intimate paragraphs and sentences
is now offered to ihe public in obedience to the writers
wish

  malgraff s incredible tale of course is easily enough
to be explained on- the ground of imaginative fabrication
such in the opinion of those who knew him would be
far from incompatible with his character in his own
whimsical and fantastic way he is said to have been
something of a joker a new search has now been in-
stituted on the supposition that he may be living some-
where in the orient and all the isles adjacent to the
banda sea will be carefully examined

  however certain collateral details are somewhat mys-
terious and baffling the materiaf and mechanism of the
sphere are unfamiliar to scientists and are still unex-

affinities with both vellum and papyrus and the pigment

the letter

dear sylvia

  you have always considered me a hopeless dreamer
and i am the last person who would endeavor or even
wish to dispute your summary it might be added that
i am one of those dreamers who have not been able to
content themselves with dreams such persons as a rule
are unfortunate and unhappy since few of them are cap-
able of realizing or even approximating their visionary
conceptions

   in my case the attempted realization has led to a singu-
lar result i am writing this letter from a world that lies
far-off in the two-fold labyrinth of time and space a world
removed by many million years from the one wherein you
live the one whereto i am native

   as you know i have never cared greatly for the mater-
ial things of earth i have always been irked by the
present age have always been devoured by a sort of nos-
talgia for other times and places it has seemed so odd-
ly and capriciously arbitrary that i should be here and
not otherwhere in the infinite eternal ranges of being
and i have long wondered if it would not be possible to
gain control of the laws that determine our temporal or
cosmic situation and pass at will from world to world
or from cycle to cycle

  it was after you dismissed me that my speculations
along such lines began to take a practical turn you
had told me that my dreamings were no less impossible
than useless perhaps among other tilings i desired to
prove that they were not impossible their utility or
inutility was not a problem that concerned me nor one
which any man could decide

  i shall not weary you with a full recountal of my
labors and researches i sought above all else to invent
a machine by which i could travel in time could pene-
trate the past or the future i started from the theory
that movement in the time-dimension could be controlled
accelerated or reversed by the action of some special
force by virtue of such regulation one would be able
to move forward or backward along the aions

	i shall say only that i succeeded in isolating the theor-
etic time-force though without learning its ultimate
nature and origin it is an all-pervading energy with a
shorter wavelength than that of the cosmic rays then i
invented a compound metal perfectly transparent and of
great toughness which was peculiarly fitted for use in
conducting and concentrating the force

  from this metal i constructed my machine with dyna-
mos in which i could develop an almost illimitable power
the reversal of the force compelling a retrograde move-
ment in time could be secured by passing the current
through certain rare volatile chemicals imprisoned in a
special device resembling a large hour-glass

  after many months of arduous effort the mechanism
stood completed on the floor of my chicago laboratory
its outward form was more or less spherical with flattened
ends like those of a chinese orange it was capable of

being hermetically sealed and the machinery included an
oxygen-apparatus within there was ample room fox
three people amid the great tubular dynamos the array
of chronometric dials and the board of regulative levers
and switches all the parts being made of the same
material were transparent as glass

  though i have never loved machinery i surveyed it
with a certain pride there was a delightful irony in the
thought that by using this super-mechanical device i could
escape from the machine-ridden era in which i had been
born

  my first intention was to explore the future by travel-
ling far enough in forward time i expected to find one
of two things men would either have learned to discard
their cumbrous and complicated engines or would have
been destroyed by them giving place to some other and
more sensible species in the course of mundane evolution

  however if the human future failed to inveigle me in
any of its phases i could reverse the working of the time-
force and go back into the aeons that were posterior to my
own epoch in these unless history and fable had lied
the conditions of life would be more congenial to my own
tastes but my most urgent curiosity was concerning the
unknown and problematic years of ages to come

  all my labors had been carried on in private with no
other aid than that of li wong my chinese cook valet and
housekeeper and at first i did not confide the purpose
of the mechanism even to li wong though i knew him
to be the most discreet and intelligent of mortals people
in general would have laughed if they had known what i
was trying to do also there were cousins and other rela-
tions all enviously watchful of my inherited wealth   
and a country full of lawyers alienists and lunatic asy-
lums i have always had a reputation for eccentricity
and i did not choose to give my dear relatives an oppor-
tunity which might have been considered legally sufficient
for the well-known process of railroading

  i had fully intended to take the time-voyage alone but
when i had finished building the machine and all was in
readiness for departure i realized that it would be impos-
sible to go without my factotum li wong apart from his
usefulness and trustworthiness the little chinaman was
good company he was something of a scholar in his own
tongue and did not belong to the coolie class though
his mastery of english was still imperfect and my knowl-
edge of chinese altogether rudimentary we had often dis-
cussed thepoetry and philosophy of his own land as well
as certain less erudite topics

  li wong received the announcement of our projected
journey with the same blandness and aplomb which he
would have shown if i had told him we were going into the
next state

  me go pack he said you want plentee shirt

  our preparations were soon made apart from the
changes of raiment suggested by li wong we took with
us a ten days supply of provisions a medicine kit and a
bottle of brandy all of which were stored in lockers i
had built for the purpose not knowing what we might
find or whal might happen by the way it was well to be
prepared for emergencies

  all was now ready i locked li wong and myself
within the time-sphere and then sat down before the in-
strument-board on which the controlling levers were
ranged i felt the thrill of a new columbus or a magel-
flight into super-time



lan about to sail for undiscovered continents compared
with this all former human explorations would be as the
crawling of emmets and pismires

  even in the exultation of that moment though every-
thing had been calculated with mathematical precision
had been worked out to an algebraic degree i recognized
the element of uncertainty and danger the effect of time-
travelling on the human constitution was an unknown
quantity neither of us might survive the process of ac-
celeration in which lustrums and decades and centuries
would be reduced to mere seconds

  i pointed this out to li wong may-
be you had better stay behind after all

i suggested

  he shook his head vigorously you
go i go he said with an imperturba-
ble smile

  making a mental note of the hour
day and minute of our departure i
pulled a lever and turned on the ac-
celerative force

	i had hardly known what to antici-
pate in the way of physical reac-
tions and sensations among other con-
tingencies it had even occurred to me
that i might become partially or wholly
unconscious and i had clamped my-
self to the seat to avoid falling in case
of this

  however the real effect was very
strange and unforeseen my first feel-
ing was that of sudden bodily lightness and immaterial-
ity at the same time the machine seemed to have ex-
panded its walls dynamos and other portions were a
dim and shining blur and appeared to repeat themselves
in an endless succession of momentary images my own
person and that of li wong were multiplied in the same
manner i was indescribably conscious of myself as a
mere flickering shadow from which was projected a series
of other shadows i tried to speak and the words be-
came an indefinitely repeated echo

  for a brief interval the sphere seemed to be hanging
in a sea of light then incomprehensibly it began to
darken a great blackness pressed upon it from with-
out but the outlines of everything within the sphere were
still visible through a sort of luminosity that clung to
them like a feeble phosphorescence

  i was puzzled by these phenomena and in particular
by the outside darkness for which i could not account
theoretically the days and night through which we were
passing at such supreme velocity would merge in a sort
of greyness

  centuries sons kalpas of time were going by in the
strange night then mysterious as the darkness there
came a sudden blinding glare of light intenser than any-
thing i had yet known which pervaded the sphere and
died away like a lightning-flash it was followed shortly
by two lesser flashes very close together and then the
outer gloom returned once more

  i reached out with a hand that became a hundred
hands and succeeded somehow in turning on the light that
hung above my instrument board and chronometric dials
one of these dials was designed to register my forward

motion in time it was hard to distinguish the real hands
and figures in the ghostly blur by which they were sur-
rounded but somehow after much poring i found that
i had gone onward into the future for no less than twenty
thousand years

   surely this would be enough at least for the initial
stage of my flight i groped for the levers and turned
off the accelerative power

   instantly my visual sensations became those of a- nor-
mal three-dimensional being in normal time and space
but the feeling of lightness and immateriality still per-
sisted it seemed to me that i ijhould
have floated in midair like a feather if
it had not been for the metal clamps
that held me to the seat

  i heard the voice of li wong whom
i had practically forgotten for the mo-
ment the voice came from above
startled i saw that the chinese with
his wide sleeves flapping ludicrously
had floated upward and was bobbing
about in the air trying vainly to res
cover his equilibrium and re-establish
his feet on the floor

   me fly all same sea-gull he tit-
tered seeming to be amused rather than
frightened by his novel predicament

  what on earth had happened was
the force of gravity non-existent in this
future world i peered out through
the glassy walls trying to detesmine
the geographical features of the terrain
in which we had landed

   it must be night i thought for all was darkness shot
with a million cold and piercing stars but why were
the stars all around us as well as above even if we
were on a mountain-top we should be surrounded by the
vague masses of remote nocturnal horizons

  but there were no horizons anywhere-only the swarm-
ing lights of irrecognizable constellations with growing
bewilderment i looked down at the crystalline floor and
beneath me as in some awful gulf there swam the icy fires
of unknown galaxies i saw with a terrific mental shock
that we were suspended in mid-space

   my first thought was that the earth and the solar system
had been annihilated somewhile during the past twenty
thousand years there had been a cosmic cataclysm and
li wong and myself moving at inconceivable speed in
the abstract time-dimension had somehow managed to es-
cape it

           chapter ii
           a bizarre world

	then like a thunderclap there came the realization of

   the truth the sphere had moved only in time but in
the interim the earth and the sun had been travelling away
from us in space even as all stellar and planetary bodies
are said to travel i had never dreamt of such a contin-
gency in all my calculations thinking that the laws of
gravitation would keep us automatically in the same posi-
tion relative to the earth itself at which we had started
but evidently these laws were non-effective in the ultra-

wonder stories for august 

spatial dimension known as time we had stood still in
regard to ordinary space and were now separated from the
earth by twenty thousand years of cosmic drift con-
sidered as a time-machine my invention was a pretty fair
vehicle for instellar transit

  to say that i was dumfounded would only prove the in-
adequacy of human words the feeling that surged upon
me was the most utter and abominable panic that i have
ever experienced the sensations of an explorer lost with-
out a compass amid the eternal unhorizoned ice of some
arctic desert would have been mild and infantile in com-
parison never before had i understood the true awful-
ness of inter-sidereal depth and distance of the gulf where-
in there is neither limitation nor direction i seemed to
whirl like a lost mote on the winds of immeasurable chaos
in a vertigo of the spirit as well as of the body

  i reached out for the lever that would reverse the time-
energy and send the sphere backward to its starting-point
then in the midst of all my panic of all my violent fear
and topsy-turvy confusion i felt a reluctance to return
even in the bleak abyss that yawns unbridgeable between
the stars i was not allured by the thought of the stale
and commonplace world i had left

  i began to recover something of stability of mental
equipoise i remembered the bright flashes that had puz-
zled me these i now realized had marked the passage
of an alien sun and planetary system coinciding in its or-
bit with the forfner position of the earth in space if i
went on in abstract time other bodies would doubtless oc-
cupy the same position in the everlasting drift of the uni-
verse by slowing the movement of the sphere it might
be feasible to land on one of them

  to you no doubt the sheer folly and madness of such
a project will be more than obvious indeed i must have
been a little mad from the physical and psychic strain of
my unparalleled experience otherwise the difficulties
of the landing which i so coolly proposed to myself-
not to mention the dangers-would have been glaringly
manifest

  i resumed the time-flight at a speed reduced by half
this i calculated would enable me to sight the next ap-
proaching orb in time to prepare for landing

 the darkness about us was unbroken for an
interval of many ages it seemed to me that eter-
nity itself had gone by in the rayless void ere a brilliant
glare of light betokened a nearing sun it passed us very
close filling half the heavens for an instant apparent-
ly there were no planets-or at least none that came
within sight

  steadily we went on in time till i ceased to watch the
dial with its blurred and multiplied ciphers i lived
only in a dream of unreal and spectral duration but
somehow after awhile i knew that more than a million
years had been traveled by the sphere

  then suddenly another solar orb swam up before us
we must have passed through it for the sphere was brief-
ly surrounded by an incandescent flame that seemed as
if it would annihilate us with its intolerable flare then
we were out of it were suspended in black space and a
smaller gleaming body was hurtling toward us

  this i knew would be a planet i slowed the sphere
to a rate of speed that would permit me to examine it
the thing loomed upon us it whirled beneath us in a
riot of massed images i thought that i could distinguish

seas and continents isles and mountains it rose still
nearer and appeared to surround us with swirling forms
that were suggestive of enormous vegetable growths

  my hand wis poised in readiness on the lever that would
terminate our flight as we swung dizzily amid the swirl-
ing forest i brought the machine to a full stop no doubt
risking an instant destruction i heard a violent crash
and the vessel rocked and reeled deliriously then it
seemed to right itself and stood still it was lurching
half to one side and i had nearly been wrenched from
my seat while li wong was sprawling in an undignified
position on the floor but nevertheless we had landed

                                

	still giddy and trying to regain my equilibrium i

  peered through the crystalline walls on a weird and ex-
uberant tangle of bewildering plant-forms the time-ma-
chine was lodged between the swollen liver-colored boles
of certain of these plants and was hanging four or five
feet in air above a pink and marshy soil from which pro-
truded like sinister horns the brownish-purple tips of un-
known growths

  overhead there were huge pale flabby leaves with
violet veinings in which i seemed to detect the arterial
throb of sluggish pulses the leaves depended from the
bulbous top of each plant like a circle of flattened arms
from a headless torso

  there were other vegetable forms all crowding and
looming grotesquely in the green vaporous air whose
density was such as to give almost the appearance of a
submarine garden to the odd scene from every side i
received a confused impression of python-like rattans of
poddy fulsome coral-tinted fronds and white or vermil-
ion fungoid blossoms large as firkins above the jungle-
tops an olive-golden glimmering in the thick atmosphere
betokened the meridian rays of a muffled sun

  my first feelings were those of astonishment-the scene
before me was a source of giddiness to eye and brain
then as i began to distinguish new details in the medley
of towering outlandish shapes i conceived a super-added
emotion of horror of veritable disgust

  at intervals there were certain immense bowi-like flow-
ers supported on strong hispid stems of a curious tripodal
sort and hued with the ghastly greens and purples of
putrefying flesh in these bowls the squat bulks of mam-
moth insects-or rather of what i took to be such at the
moment-were crouching in an evil immobility with
strange antennae and other organs or members hanging
down over the rims of the bowls

  these monsters appeared to mock the cadaverous color-
ing of the flowers they were inexpressibly loathsome
and i shall not endeavor to describe their anatomy with
any degree of minuteness i shall however mention the
three snail-like horns ending in ruby-red eyes that rose
above their bodies and watched the forest around them
with a baleful vigilance

  about the base of each of the tripodal stems i per-
ceived the carcasses of quaint animals lying in a circle in
varying stages of decomposition from many of these
carrion new plants of the same type as the bowl-flowers
were issuing with dark ghoulish buds that had not yet
unfolded

  as i studied these plants and their guardians with
growing repulsion a six-legged creature something be-
tween a wart-hog and an iguana emerged from the jungle
flight into super-time



and trotted past within a dozen feet of the time-sphere
if approached one of the bowl-shaped blossoms and
sniffed at the hairy triple stem with a thin ant-eater snout
then to my horror the squatting form in the bowl
sprang forth with lightning rapidity and landed on the
spine of the hapless animal i saw the flash of a knife-
like sting that was buried in the grotesque body the
victim struggled feebly and then lay supine while its
assailant proceeded to make use of an organ that resem-
bled the ovipositor of the ichneumon-fly

  all this was highly revolting and even more repulsive
was my discovery that the insect-form was actually a part
of the flower in which it had been reposing it hung by
a long pallid snaky rope like a sort of umbilical cord
from the center of the tilted bowl and after the hideous
thing had finished with its victim the cord began to
shorten drawing the monster back to its lurking-place
there it squatted as before watching for fresh prey with
its ruby eyes it was damnably obvious that the plant
belonged to a semi-faunal genus and was wont to deposit
its seeds or eggs in animal bodies

  i turned to li wong who was surveying the scene with
manifest disapprobation in his almond eyes

  meno likee this he shook his head gravely as he
spoke

  cant say that i care much for it eitherw i returned
considered as a landing-place this particular planet
leaves a good deal to be desired i fear well have to
go on for a few more million or trillion years and try
our luck elsewhere

  i peered out once more wondering if the other plant-
types around us were all possessed of some disagreeable
and aggressive character or ability like the bowl-flowers
 was not reassured when i noticed that some of the ser-
pentine rattans were swaying sluggishly toward the time-
sphere and that one of them had already reached it and
was creeping along the wall with tiny tendrils that ended
in suction-cups

  then from amid the curling vapors and crowding
growths a bizarre being appeared and ran toward the
time-machine barely avoiding one of the cord-suspended
monsters as it launched itself from a tall blossom the
thing fell short of its intended prey by a mere inch or
two and swung horribly in midair like a goblin pendu-
lum before it was retracted by the long elastic cord

 the aforesaid being was about the height of an aver-
age man he was bipedal but exhibited four arms
two of which issued from either side of his elongated
pillar-like neck and the other two from positions half-
way down on his wasp-waisted thorax his facial features
were of elfin delicacy and a high fluted comb of ivory
rose from his broad and hairless crown

  his nose or what appeared to be such was equipped
with mobile feelers that hung down beside his tiny puck-
ered mouth like oriental mustaches and his round dis-
coid ears were furnished with fluttering streamer-like
diaphanous membranes thin as strips of parchment on
which were curious hieroglyphic markings

  his small sapphire-brilliant eyes were set far apart be-
neath ebon semicircles that seemed to have been drawn
with pigment on his pearly skin a short cape of some
flofey vermillion fabric served to cover his upper body

but apart from this there was nothing that one could dis-
tinguish as artificial raiment

  avoiding several more of the plant-monsters who lunged
viciously he neared the time-machine plainly he had
seen us and it seemed to me that his sapphire eyes im-
plored us for succor and refuge

  i pressed a button which served to unlock and open the
door of the sphere as the door swung outward li wong
and i were assailed by numerous unearthly smells many
of which were far from pleasant we breathed the surge
of an air that was heavy with oxygen and was also laden
with the vapors of unfamiliar chemical elements

  with a long flying leap the strange entity sprang in
air and grained the crystal sill of the open machine i
caught the flexible three-fingered hands of his lower arms
and drew him to safety then i closed the door just as
one of the cord-hung monsters hurtled against it breaking
its keen steely-looking sting and staining the clear metal
with a rill of amber-yellow venom

  welcome stranger  said

  our guest was breathing heavily and his facial feelers
trembled and swayed with the palpitation of his fine mem-
branous nostrils apparently he was too breathless for
speech but he made a series of profound inclinations with
his crested head and moved his tenuous fingers with flut-
tering gestures that were somehow expressive of regard
and gratitude

  when be had recovered his breath and had composed
himself a little he began to talk in a voice of unearthly
pitch with sharp cadences and slowly rising intonations
which i can compare only to the notes of certain tropic
birds of course li wong and i could only guess at
his meaning since the words wherever distinguishable
as such were totally different from those of any human
tongue or dialect

  we surmised however that he was thanking us and
was also offering us an explanation of the perils from
which we had rescued him he seemed to be telling us a
lengthy tale accompanied with many dramatic gestures
of an odd but eloquent sort from certain of these we
gathered that his presence in that evil jungle was invol-
untary that he had been abandoned there by enemies
in the hope that he would never escape from the wilder-
ness of monstrous plants

  by signs he told us that the jungle was of enormous
extent and was filled with growths that were even more
dreadful than the bowl-flowers

  afterwards when we had learned to understand the
language of this quaint being we found that our sur-
mises had been correct but the narrative in its entirety
was even stranger and more fantastical than we had imag-
ined

  as i listened to our guest and watched the swiftly weav-
ing movements of his four hands i became aware that a
shadow had fallen upon us intercepting the green watery
light of the blurred heavens looking up i saw that a
small air-vessel of discoid form surrounded with turn-
ing wheels and pointed wings that whirred like the sails
of a windmill was descending toward us and was hovering
just above the time-machine

  our guest perceived it also and broke off abruptly fn
hia story-telling  could see that he was greatly alarmed
and agitated i inferred that the air-vessel belonged
perhaps to his enemies to the very beings who had left


wonder stories for august 

him to a cruel doom in that fearsome terrain no doubt
they had returned to make sure of his fate or else their
attention had in some manner been attracted by the ap-
pearance of the time-sphere

  the alien ship was now hanging near the tops of the
giant plants between whose boles the sphere had become
lodged in landing through the silvery whirl of its wings
and rotating wheels i saw the faces of several entities
who bore a general likeness to our guest and were plainly
of the same racial type one of these beings was hold-
ing a many-mouthed instrument with a far-off resemblance
to the gatling gun or mitrailleuse and was aiming it at
the time-machine

  our passenger gave a piercing cry and clutched my
arm with two of his hands while he pointed upward with
the others i required no interpreter and no lengthy
process of reasoning to understand that we were in grave
danger from the foreign vessel and its occupants i sprang
immediately to the instrument board and released the
lever that would send us onward in time at the utmost speed
of which the machine was capable

chapter iii
the flight through time

	even as i pulled the lever there came from the ship a

  flash of cold and violescent light that seemed to envelop
the time-sphere then all things in the world without
were resolved into a flying riot of formless evanescent
images and around us once more after a brief interval
was the ebon darkness of interstellar space again the
ship was filled with momentary repeated phantoms to
which were added those if our curious guest again the
dials the levers and the dynamos multiplied themselves in
a dim phosphorescent glow

  later i learned that our flight into forward aeons had
saved us from utter annihilation only by the fraction of a
second the force emitted by the many-mouthed weapon
on the air-vessel would have turned the sphere into van-
ishing vapor if we had sustained it for more than a mo-
ment

  somehow i managed to clamp myself into the seat once
more and sat watching the weirdly manifolded hands and
ciphers that registered our progress in universal time fifty
thousand years-a hundred thousand-a million-and still
we floated alone in the awesome gulf of the everlasting
cosmic midnight if any suns or planets had passed us
during the interim they had gone by at a distance which
rendered them invisible

  li wong and the new passenger had clutched at the
handles of the lockers in which our provisions were stored
to keep themselves from drifting aimlessly about in mid-
air i heard the babble of their voices whose every lone
and syllable was subdivided into a million echoes

  a peculiar faintness came upon me and a dream-like
sense of the unreal and irrational attached itself to all my
impressions and ideas i seemed to have gone beyond all
that was conceivable or comprehensible to have overpassed
the very boundaries of creation the black chaos in which
i wandered was infinitely lost from all direction and
orientation was beyond life itself or the memory of life
and my consciousness seemed to flicker and drown in the
dark nullitude of an incommensurable void

  still we went on along the ages on the far-off reced-
ing earth as well as on other planets whole civilizations
had evolved and elapsed and been forgotten and many
historical epochs and geological eras had gone by moons
and worlds and even great suns had been destroyed
travelling down their eternal orbits the very constella-
tions had all shifted their stances amid the infinite these
were inconceivable thoughts and my brain was over-
whelmed by the mere effort to visualize and comprehend
their awfulness

  strangest of all was the thought that the world i had
known ias lost not only in sidereal immensity but in
the rayless night of a remote antiquity

 with more than the longing of a derelict sailor adrift
on chartless seas i desired to feel underfoot once more
the stable soil of terra firma-no matter where or what
we had already made one landing in the dizzy labyrinth
of time and space and somewhere somehow among the
aeons through which we were passing another cosmic
body might offer itself intersecting in its spatial path our
own position in abstract time

  again as before our initial landing i slowed our pro-
gress to a rate that would allow inspection of any sun
or world we might happen to approach	

  there was a long dreary interval of waiting in which
it seemed that the whole universe with all its systems and
galaxies must have gone by us and left us hanging alone
in the void that lies beyond organized matter then i
became aware of a growing light and retarding the time-
machine still further i saw that a planet was nearing us
and beyond the planet were two larger fiery bodies that i
took for a binary system of ours

  now was our opportunity and i determined to seize
it the new planet whirled beneath us it rolled upon us
amain as we still moved in time at a rate whereby whole
days were reduced to minutes a moment more and it
rose from the gulf like some gigantically swelling bub-
ble to surround us with a maze of half-cognizable imag-
eries there were atlantean mountain-tops through
which we seemed to pass and seas or level deserts above
which we appeared to hover in the midst of broken cloud-
strata now for an instant we were among buildings or
what i assumed to be such then we were hurled onward
to a broad open space i caught a confused glittering
of many-pointed lights and unidentifiable thronging
forms as i reached out and brought the sphere to a sud-
den halt

  as i have said before it was a perilous thing to stop
thus in accelerated time above a moving planet there
might well have been a collision that would have destroyed
the machines or we might have found ourselves embedded
beneath fathoms of soil or stones indeed there were any
number of undesirable possibilities and the only wonder
is that we escaped annihilation

  as it was we must have come to a halt in midair per-
haps fifteen or twenty feet above the ground of course
we were seized immediately by the gravitational influence
of the new world even as my sense-impressions cleared
with the cessation of the time-flight we fell with a ter-
rible ear-splitting crash and the sphere almost seemed to
rebound and then rolled over careening on its side i was
torn from my seat by the shock of impact and li wong
and our passenger were hurled to the floor beside me
the stranger and myself though sorely bruised and shak-
flight into super-time



en contrived to retain consciousness but i saw that li
wong had been stunned by the fall

	giddily with swaying limbs and reeling senses i tried

  to stand up and somehow succeeded my first thought
was for li wong who was lying inert against the tilted
dynamos a hasty examination showed me that he was
uninjured my second thought was for the time-machine
whose tough metal revealed no visible damage then in-
evitably the world into which we had fallen in a manner
so precipitate was forced upon my attention

  we had come down in the very center of what appeared
to be an active battle-field all around us was a formi-
dable array of chariot-like vehicles high-wheeled and high-
bodied drawn by quaint monsters that recalled the drag-
ons of heraldry and driven by beings of an unearthly kind
who were little more than pygmies

  there were many foot soldiers too and all were armed
with weapons such as have never been used in human his-
tory there were spears that ended in curving saw-toothed
blades and swords whose hilts were in the middle and
spiked balls at the end of long leathern thongs which
were hurled at the enemy and then drawn back by their
owners also each of the chariots was fitted with a
catapult from which similar balls were flung

  the users of these weapons had paused in the midst
of what was plainly a ferocious battle and were all star-
ing at the time-machine some i saw had been crushed
beneath the heavy sphere as it plunged among them oth-
ers had drawn back and were eyeing us doubtfully

  even as i surveyed thissingular scene with bewilder-
ment that permitted no more than a partial cognizance of
its baffling details i saw that the interrupted combat was
being resumed the monster-drawn chariots swayed back
and forth and the air was thick with flying missiles some
of which hurtled against the walls of the sphere it
seemed perhaps that our presence was having an effect on
the morale of these fantastic warriors many of us who
were nearest to the sphere began to retreat while others
pressed forward and i was able for the first time to dis-
tinguish the members of the two factions who obviously
belonged to different races

  those of one faction who were all foot-soldiers armed
with spears and swords were seemingly a rude barbaric
type they outnumbered the others greatly their
fearsome uncouth features were like graven masks of fury
and malignity and they fought with a savage despera-
tion

  their opponents who comprised all the ehariot-drivers
as well as a smaller body of foot-soldiers were more deli-
cate and civilized in appearance with slighter limbs and
anatomies they made a skillful use of their catapults
and the tide of the battle seemed to be turning in their
favor when i perceived that all those who had been
struck down by the time-machine belonged to the more
barbarous type i inferred that possibly our apparition
had been construed as favorable to one faction and inimi-
cal to the other the catapult-users were gaining cour-
age and the spear and sword bearers were becoming vis-
ibly demoralized

  the combat turned to an ever-growing rout the corps
of chariots gathered in a crushing mass about the time-
sphere and drove the enemy swiftfy back while in the

heat of conflict a barrage of singular weapons continued
to assail our hyaline walls

  ferocious-looking as they were the dragons seemed to
take no active part in the struggle and were plainly mere
beasts of draught or burden but the slaughter was ter-
rific and crushed or trodden bodies were lying every-
where the role of deus ex machina which i appeared
to be playing in this outlandish battle was not one that
i should have chosen of my own accord and i soon de-
cided that it would be better to fare even further afield in
universal time

  i pulled the starting-lever but to my confoundment
and consternation there was no result the mechanism
in some manner had been jarred or disconnected by the
violence of our fall though i could not locate the precise
difficulty at that moment afterwards i found that the
connection between the instrument-board and the dyamos
had been broken thus rendering the force inoperative

  li wong had now recovered consciousness rubbing
his head he sat up and appeared to be pondering our re-
markable milieu with all the gravity of an oriental philo-
sopher our passenger was peering out with his brilliant
sapphire eyes on this world to which he was no less alien
than li wong and myself he seemed to be eyeing the
odd warriors and their dragon-teams with a cool scientific
interest

  the more civilized of the two factions was now driving
its enemies from the field in a tide of carnage our sound-
proof walls prevented us from hearing the crash and
rumble of chariot-wheels the clangor of clashing weapons
and the cries that were doubtless being emitted by the war-
riors

  since nothing could be done at the moment to repair our
machinery i resigned myself not without misgivings to
an indefinite sojourn in the world whereon we had landed
so fortuitously

	in perhaps ten minutes the raging battle was over the

  unslain remnant of the barbarians was in full flight
and the conquerors who had poured past us in an irresis-
tible torrent were returning and massing about the sphere
at a little distance

  several whom i took for commanding officers descend-
ed from their cars and approached us they prostrated
themselves before the machine in the universal posture
of reverence

  for the first time i was able to form an exact impres-
sion of the appearance of these beings the tallest of
them was barely four feet in height and their limbs
which were normal in number according to human ideas
were slender as those of elves or leprechauns their
movements were very swift and graceful and were seem-
ingly aided by a pair of small wings or erigible mem-
branes attached to their sloping shoulders

  their faces were marked by a most elaborate develop-
ment of the nostrils and eyes and the ears and mouths
were little more than vestigial by contrast the nasal
apparatus was convoluted like that of certain bats with
mobile valves arranged in rosettes and a nether appen-
dage that recalled the petals of a butterfly orchid the
eyes were proportionately enormous and were set obli-
quely

  they were furnished with vertical lids and possessed a
power of semicircular rotation and also of protrusion and

retraction in their deep orbits this power we learned
later enabled them to magnify or reduce any visual image
at will and also to alter or invert the perspective in which
it was seen

  these peculiar beings were equipped with body-armor
of red metal marked off in ovoid scales their light-
brown arms and legs were bare somehow their whole
aspect was very gentle and un-warlike i marvelled at
the prowess and bravery which they had shown in the late
battle

  they continued their obeisances before the time-ma-
chine rising and prostrating themselves anew in an al-
ternation like a set ritual with gestures and genuflections
of hieratic significance i conceived the idea that they
regarded the machine itself as a conscious intelligent and
perhaps supernal entity and that we the occupants if
perceived at all were considered as internal and integral
parts of the mechanism

  li wong and i began to debate the advisibility of open-
ing the door and revealing ourselves to these fantastic
devotees unluckily i had neglected to provide the
sphere with any device for determining the chemical com-
position of other-world atmospheres and i was not sure
that the outside air would prove wholly suitable for hu-
man respiration it was this consideration rather than
any actual fear of the mild quaint warriors that caused
me to hesitate

  i decided to defer our epiphany and i was about to
resume my examination of the deranged machinery when
i noticed an ebullition in the massed ranks of soldiers
that were drawn up around us at some little distance the
ranks parted with a swift flowing motion leaving a wide
lane through which presently a remarkable vehicle ad-
vanced

  the vehicle was a sort of open platform mounted on
numerous low squat wheels and drawn by a dozen of the
dragon-creatures arranged in teams of four the plat-
form was rectangular and the small castor-like wheels
served to elevate it little more than a foot above the
ground i could not determine its material which was
copperish in color and suggested a heavily metallic stone
rather than a pure smelted metal it was without fur-
nishings or superstructure aside from a low breastwork
at the front behind which three drivers stood each hold-
ing the separate reins of a tandem of monsters at the
rear a strange outward-curving arm or crane of some
black lustrous material ending in a thick disk rose high
in the air one of the elfin people stood beside this
crane

  with exquisite and admirable skill the drivers brought
their unwieldy conveyance forward in a sweeping arc
through the empty space between the time-vessel and the
surrounding army the devotees of the sphere who must
have been commanding officers retired to one side and
the monster-hauled vehicle passing us closely was
adroitly manuevered and drawn about till it came to a
halt with its rear end opposite the sphere and the black
arm inclining above our very heads with its heavy hori-
zontal disk

  the being whq stood beside the curving arm began to
manipulate an oddly shaped and movable projection
which must have been a sort of lever or control in its
dark surface watching him curiously i became aware
of a sudden and increasing glare of light overhead and

looking tip i saw that a lid-like cover was sliding back
from the disk at the arms end revealing a fire-bright sub-
stance that dazzled the eye

  simultaneously i felt a sensation of corporeal light-
ness of growing weightlessness i reeled with vertigo
and reaching toward the wall in an effort to steady my-
self i floated buoyantly from the floor and drifted in mid-
air li wong and the stranger i perceived were floun-
dering eerily and helplessly about amid the machinery

  perplexed by this phenomenon of degravitation i did
not realize at first that there had been a similar levitation
of the time-sphere itself then as i turned in my aerial
tumbling i saw that the sphere had risen from the ground
and was now on a level with the floor of the strange con-
veyance it occurred to me that an unknown magnetic
force was being emitted by the bright disk above our
heads

  no sooner had i conceived this idea than the outward-
curving arm began to rotate swinging back upon the vehi-
cle of which it formed a part and the time-machine as if
suspended by invisible chains swung with it maintaining
a vertical position beneath the moving disk in a trice
it was gently deposited on the platform then like the
switching-off of a light the glaring disk was covered again
by its dark lid and the properties of normal weight re-
turned to my companions and to me

chapter iv

the great battle

	the whole process of loading the sphere upon the plat-
form had been accomplished with remarkable celerity
and efficiency as soon as it was completed the three
drivers in perfect concert reined their animals about
in a long semicircle and started off on the route by which
they had come moving at considerable speed we rolled
easily along the wide lane that had been opened through
the quaint army the chariots and foot-soldiers closed
behind us as we went and looking back i saw them wheel
about and reform with the chariots in the van passing
through the outmost ranks we took the lead and the whole
army followed us in martial order across a low plain

  i was struck by the seeming discrepancy between the
preter-human control of gravitation possessed by this cur-
ious people and their somewhat primitive modes of war-
fare and conveyance judging them as i did by -ter-
restrial standards i could not reconcile these things and
the true explanation was too bizarre and fantastic for
me to have imagined it beforehand

  we proceeded toward our unknown destination with
the dragons trotting at a leisurely pace that covered
more ground than one would have expected i began to
observe the surrounding milieu and to take note of much
that had escaped me heretofore

  the plain i saw was treeless with low hummocks and
intervals of winding mounds and was wholly covered
with a short iichenous growth that formed a kind of
yellow-green turf one of the two suns was hanging at
meridian and the other was either just rising or setting
for it hovered close to a far-off horizon of glaucous hills
the sky was tinted with deep green and i saw that this
color was due to the combined light of the suns one of
which was azure blue and the other verging upon amber
flight into super-time



  after we had gone on for several miles and had passed
a row of intervening hummocks i beheld a strange city
in the near distance with low mushroom domes and
peristyles of massive pillars that gleamed like rosy mar-
ble in the sunlight amid plots of orange and indigo and
violet vegetation

  this city proved to be our objective it was thronged
with people among whom we passed on the dragon-drawn
platform borne like the trophies of a triumph the build-
ings were roomy and well-spaced and were character-
ized by deep porticoes with swelling bulbous columns
we learned subsequently that the material used in their
construction was a sort of petrified wood belonging to
a genus of giant prehistoric trees that had been quarried
in enormous blocks

  after passing through many streets we neared in
what was apparently the center of the town a huge cir-
cular edifice it consisted of a single dome upborne on
rows of open colossal pillars with an entrance broad
and high enough to admit with ease the vehicle on which
the time-sphere was being carried we rolled smoothly
through the portals and along a level pavement beneath
the vast dome

  the place was illumed by the horizontal rays of the
sinking yellow sun which fell on the ruddy floor in
broad shafts between the massy pillars i received an
impression of immense empty space of rosy-golden air
and light then in the center as we went forward i
saw a sort of dais on which stood an extraordinary ma-
chine or contrivance of parti-colored metals towering
alone like an idol in some pagan fane

  the dais like the building was circular and rose
four or five feet above the main pavement it was per-
haps sixty feet in diameter and there were several stairs
graduated to the steps of the pygmy people that gave
access to it around the dais in semi-circles on the pave-
ment with ample space between there stood many low
tables supported on carven cubes and with benches about
them all of the same material as the edifice itself the
tables were set with numerous black pots deep and shal-
low and multiform in which grew flowers of opulent
orange and cassava colors together with others of delicate
white of frail pink and silvery green

  these details i perceived hastily and confusedly as our
conveyance moved on toward the central dais without
endangering any of the tables a sprinkling of people
who gave the impression of menials were hurrying about
the place bringing new flower-pots or re-arranging certain
of the ones that had already been disposed many of the
elfin warriors dismounting from thefr chariots had fol-
lowed us through the great portals

  now the vehicle had drawn up beside the dais by the
operation of the black arm with its magnetic disk the
time-machine was lifted from the platform and deposited
on the dais not far from the tall contrivance of multi-
colored metals then circling the dais the vehicle with-
drew with its dragon-team and vanished through the open
entrance

	whether the place was a temple or merely a public

  hall i could not decide it was like the phantasma-
goria of some bewildering dream and the mystery of it
all was not solved when i noticed that hundreds of the
faery people were seating themselves at the flower-laden

tables and were bending toward the blossoms with a regu-
lar contraction and expansion of their voluted nostrils
as if they were inhaling delicious perfumes to com-
plicate my bewilderment still further i could distinguish
nothing on any of the tables in the form of food nour-
ishment or even drink such as these heroic warriors might
well be expected to require after an arduous battle

  dismissing temporarily the baffling enigma i turned
my attention to the peculiar mechanism which occupied
the dais together with the time-sphere here too i found
myself at a loss for i could not even surmise its nature
and purpose i had never seen anything like it among the
most ingenious pernicious and grotesque inventions of
terrene mechanics

  the thing was quite gigantic with a bristling serried
and fearsome array of highly polished rods and pistons
it had long spiral bands and abrupt angular flanges be-
hind which i made out the half-hidden outlines of a squat
cylindrical body mounted or at least seven or eight pon-
derous legs that terminated in huge pads like the feet of
hippopotami

  above the complicated mass there towered a sort of
triple head or superstructure of three globes one above
the ether on a long metal neek the heads were fitted
with rows of eye-like facets cold and bright as diamonds
and possessed numerous antennas and queer unnameahle
appendages some of great length the whole apparatus
had the air of some mysterious living entity-a super-ma-
chine endowed with sentience and with intellect and the
three-tiered head with its chill eyes appeared to watch us
malignly and inscrutably like a metal argus

  the thing was a miracle of machinery and it gleamed
with hues of gold and steel of copper and malachite of
silver and azurite and cinnabar but more and more i
was impressed by an evil and brooding intentness an aura
of the sinister and the inimical the monstrosity was mo-
tionless-but intelligent then as i continued my inspec-
tion i saw a movement of the foremost legs and became
aware that the machine was advancing stiffly on its mas-
sive pads toward the time-vessel

  it paused at an interval of five or six fet and put out
a long thin supple many-jointed tentacle from the mass
of appendages that adorned its topmost head with this
tentacle like a raised whip it struck smartly several times
at the curving wall of the sphere

  i could not help feeling somewhat alarmed as well as
puzzled for the action was unmistakably hostile the
blows of the tentacle were somehow like a challenge-
the equivalent so to speak of an actual slap in the face
and the wary movement with which the machine stepped
back and stood facing us after delivering the whip-
sharp blows was curiously like the manoeuvre of a fight-
er squaring himself for combat the thing seemed al-
most to crouch on its elephantine metal legs and pads
and there was a air of covert menace in its poised array
of mysterious deadly-looking parts and appendages

  at this moment there occurred a singular interruption
which in all likelihood was the means of averting our
death and the destruction of the time-globe a group
of the elfin people four in number ascended the stairs of
the dais and approached us bearing among them a large
vessel like an open shallow urn or deep basin which was
filled to the brim with a sluggish hueless liquid suggest-
ing immediately some sort of mineral oil behind this


wonder stories for august 

group there came a second carrying another vessel full
of the same oleaginous fluid

  the two delegations moving forward in perfect unison
deposited their burdens at the same instant with the same
peculiar genuflections setting one of the basins before the
time-sphere and the other at the feet of the belligerent
alien mechanism afterwards they retired discreetly as
they had come the whole performance had the air of a
religious rite-a sacrificial offering intended to appease
doubtful or angry deities

  not without inward amusement i wondered what use
the time-sphere was supposed to make of the oily liquid
it seemed probable that we and our conveyance were re-
garded as a single mechanism active and intelligent and
perhaps similar in kind to the curious robot we had found
occupying the dais

  the latter machine however was manifestly familiar
with such offerings for without acknowledgment or cere-
mony it proceeded to stoop over and dip certain of its
metal proboscides in the oil these organs i perceived
were hollow at the ends like the trunks of elephants and
i saw that the liquid in the basin was diminishing rapidly
as if it were being sucked up

  when the vessel was half empty the monster withdrew
its proboscides and then by the simultaneous use of
these members turning and coiling with great suppleness
in different directions it began to oil the innumerable
joints and flanges of its intricate machinery several
times it suspended this remarkable process eyeing the
time-sphere balefully as if watching for a hostile move-
ment the whole performance was inconceivably gro-
tesque and ludicrous-and sinister

  the main floor of the huge pillared hall i now saw
had filled with the pigmy warriors who were seated about
the flower-burdened tables all of them seemed to be
inhaling the odors of these flowers in a manner that re-
sembled actual ingustation and i conceived the idea that
they were regaling themselves with a feast of perfumes
and perhaps required no other nutriment

	turning from this quaint spectacle to which i had given
only a cursory glance i perceived that the metal mon-
ster had apparently finished the anointing of its complex
machinery and was again posting itself in an attitude
preparatory for battle there was a stealthy turning of
half-hidden wheels and cogs a covert throbbing of well-
oiled pistons as the mechanism faced us and certain of
its tentacles were poised in air like lifted weapons

  what would have happened next in the normal course
of events i am not altogether sure but the probabilities
are that we would have been blotted out of existence very
promptly efficiently and summarily again by a singu-
lar intervention the time-vessel was saved from the anger
of its strange antagonist

  without warning there came a flash of brilliant blind-
ing flame as if a thunderbolt had issued from mid-air be-
tween the dais and the dome there was a crashing
shivering noise that shook and penetrated our virtually
sound-proof walls and everything about us seemed to
rock with the convulsions of a violent earthquake the
concussion hurled us back upon our dynamos and i
thought for an instant that the sphere would be flung from
the dais recovering myself  saw that a third machine

had materialized on the dais opposite the time-sphere and
its opponent

  this machine differed as much from the hostile robot
as the latter in its turn differed from the timc-globe it
was a sort of immense polyhedron with an arrangement
of numberless facets alternately opaque and transparent
through some of the facets clearer than glass i was hor-
rified and astonished to behold the thronging faces of en-
tities similar to or perhaps identical with the beings who
had threatened us from the air-vessel in that far-off world
where we had picked up our unusual passenger

  there could be only one explanation we had been pur-
sued through the cosmic continuum by these vengeful and
pertinacious creatures who had evidently employed a liine-
space vehicle of their own they must have possessed
unique instruments of incredible range and delicacy by
which to detect and follow onr course in the labyrinth of
stellar gulfs and ages turning to our passenger i saw
by his troubled air and frantic gestures that he too had
recognized the pursuers since i had not yet been able to
repair our machinery the position in which we now stood
was a serious dilemma we were without weapons of any
kind for it had not even occurred to me to bring along a
revolver i began to wish that i had fitted the time-ma-
chine with the arsenal of an american racketeer

  however there was little time for either regret or ap-
prehension the course of events was now taking an un-
foreseen and incalculable turn the formidable robot
diverted from its war-like designs upon us by the appear-
ance of the newcomer had immediately squared itself
around to face the polyhedron with its metal members
raised in a flailing gesture of menace

  the occupgls of the polyhedron on their part seemed
to disregard the robot several of the opaque facets be-
gan to slide back in the manner of ports and revealed the
yawning mouths of tubular weapons all of which were
levelled at the time-sphere it appeared that these people
were intent only on destroying us after having followed us
with fantastical vindictiveness through many asons

  the robot it would seem construed the opening of the
ports as an act inimical to itself or perhaps it did not
wish to yield its legitimate prey the time-sphere to an-
other and foreign mechanism at any rate it bristled
forward winnowing the air with all its tentacles and pro-
boscides and tramping heavily on the dais with its my-
riad pads till it stood within grappling-distance of the
polyhedron

  coils of greyish vapor were beginning to issue from
valves in its cylindrical body and pipe-like throat and
raising one of its hollow proboscides it snorted forth a
sudden jet of crimson flame-a briefly flaring tongue that
struck an upper facet of the polyhedron causing it to
melt and collapse inward like so much solder

  the occupants of the alien time-machine were now
slewing their tube-weapons around to face the robot a
violent fire leaped from one of the tubes spreading like
a fan and severing cleanly an upraised tentacle of the
monster

  at this the angry mechanism seemed to go mad and
hurled itself at the polyhedron like some enormous octo-
pus of metal jets of scarlet fire were issuing from sev-
eral of its trunk-shaped organs and great ruinous rents
appeared in the facets of the polyhedron beneath their
incessant playing
flight into super-time



  undismayed by this the wielders of the tube-weapons
concentrated their violet beams on the robot inflicting
terrific damage the uppermost of the three globular
heads was partly shot away and metal filaments trailed
from its broken rim like a shredded brain the serried
array of tossing members was torn and lopped like a
flame-swept forest rods cogs pistons and other parts
dripped on the dais in a molten rain two of the fore-
most legs crumpled in shapeless ruin-but still the mon-
ster fought on and the polyhedron became a twisted
wreck beneath the focussing of the red fires

  soon several of the violet beams were extinguished
and their wielders had dissolved into vapor and ashes but
others were still in action and one of them struck the cen-
tral cylinder of the robot after demolishing the outer
machinery and bored into it steadily like an acetylene
torch the beam must have penetrated a vital part for
suddenly there was a tremendous all-engulfing flare a
cataclysmic explosion

  the immense dome appeared to totter on its trembling
columns and the dais shook like a stormy sea then an
instant later there fell from a dark cloud of swelling
steam a rain of metal fragments glancing along our
crystalline sides and strewing the dais and the main floor
for some distance around the monster in its explosion
had involved the alien time-vessel which was wholly riven
asunder and nothing remained of our pursuers but a few
blackened cinders

  apart from this mutual and highly providential de-
struction of the inimical mechanisms no serious damage
had been done for the main building i now perceived
for the first time was deserted-the pygmies had aban-
doned their feast of odors and had retired discreetly per-
haps at the very onset of the battle the time-sphere
though it had taken no part in the combat was left by a
singular and ironic fortuity in sole possession of the field

  i decided that fortune being so favorably disposed to-
ward us might be tempted even further with impunity
so i opened the door of the vessel and found that the at-
mosphere of the world outside was perfectly breathable
though laden with an odd mixture of metallic fumes that
lingered from the late explosion and fruity and luscious
fragrances from the potted blossoms

chapter v
the world of mohaun los

	li wong and the passenger and i emerged on the dais

  the yellow sun had gone down and the place swam
with the blue religious light of its ascendant binary we
were examining the littered ruins of the strang machines
when a large delegation of elfin warriors re-entered and
approached us we could not divine their thoughts and
emotions but it seemed to me that their genuflections were
even more expressive of profound reverence and grati-
tude than those with which the time-sphere had been hailed
after the routing of the barbarian army i received an
almost telepathic impression that they were thanking us
for a supposed act of deliverance at which we had been
merely the onlookers

  in time this impression was to be fully confirmed the-
metal monster it seemed had come originally like our-
selves from the outside universe and had settled itself
among this perfume-eating people they had treated it

with all due respect had housed it in their public hall of
assembly and had supplied it liberally with certain min-
eral lubricants which it required the machine in ex-
change had deigned t instruct them regarding a few scien-
tific and mechanical secrets such as that of degravitation by
means of a reverse magnetic force but the people being
somewhat non-inventive and non-mechanical by nature had
made little use of this robot-imparted knowledge

  the metal monster in time had become disagreeably
exacting and tyrannical and moreover it had refused
flatly to help the pigmies in their war with another people
when need arose therefore they were glad to be rid
of it and they seemed to take it for granted that we had
made away with the monster as well as with the invading
time-machine so far i have not thought it worth while
to disillusion them

  no less than seven terrestrial months tiave now gone
by since the landing of the sphere my companions and
i are still sojourning among the perfume-eaters and we
have no reason to complain of our lot and no cause to
lament the worlds we have left so far behind us in time
and space

  in the interim we have learned many things and are
now able to hold converse with our hosts having familiar-
ized ourselves by slow degrees with the peculiar phone-
tics of their speech

  the name of the world as well as i can render it in
human spelling is mohaun los being subject to the
gravitational pull of two solar bodies it follows a some-
what eccentric and prolonged annual orbit neverthe-
less the climate is equable and salubrious though marked
by meteoric phenomena of an unearthly sort

  the people among whom we are dwelling sail them-
selves the psounas they are a fine and estimable race
though bizarre from a human standpoint as any of the
mythic tribes whose anatomy and customs were described
by herodotus they are the ruling race of the planet
and are inconceivably more advanced in many ways than
their rude weapons and methods of warfare would lead
one to imagine astronomy and mathematics in parti-
cular have been developed by them to a degree that is
far beyond the achievement of human savants

  their food consists of nothing grosser than perfumes
and at first it was not easy to convince them that we
required a more material nourishment however nnce
they had grasped the idea they supplied us abundantly
with the meaty foods in which mohaun los abounds and
they did not seem to be shocked or scandalized by our base
appetites-even though fruits and other non-atomizable
matters are eaten only by animals and the more aboriginal
races of this world the psounas indeed have shown
toward us at all times a spirit of urbane tolerance and
laissez faire

  they are a peaceful race and during their whole for-
mer history have had little need to acquire the martial
arts but the recent evolutionary development of a half-
bestial tribe the gholpos who have now learned to or-
ganize themselves and to make weapons and have be-
come quite aggressive as a consequence has compelled
the psounas to take the field in self-defense

	it was done in a moment  i turned away from
the breeze to light my pipe the night was dark the
flare of the match blinded me for a minute so when i
heard a grunt behind me i grabbed my electric torch   
but he was gone

  john hand shrugged and puffed calmly on the big
black pipe that had been his undoing

  ye say yerself and ostermann were out walking in the
garden werent ye a bit foolish to allow him out of the
house mr hand

  john hand puffed a little more quickly at the pipe-an
ominous sign his temper was short today and mc-
querdle was dragging this old story out of him again-
for the half-dozenth time

  as ive told you before he said without the defer-
ential air that should be used towards a boss the garden
was surrounded by two hundred swedish police and sol-
diers-good men a cat couldnt have got in or out
ah-h andrew mcquerdle chief of the secret
service division u s government could be painfully ir-
ritating on occasion the peace of mind of his opera-
tives was no concern of his ah    and so ye have
taken up the study ul occultism and the more theoretical
sciences to explain yer failure it has been five months
since ye allowed johann ostermann to be spirited away
right under yer nose-and what have ye done since then
ye know that only by a presidential order have secrel
service men been put on this case and now as far as i
can make out from yer reports yeve spent most of yer
time in libraries universities astronomers observatories
and other institutions of the more useless sort of learning
ye are going a long way to explain a simple failure in
detective work mr hand i begin to doubt your san-
ity and i cannot doubt your uselessness to this depart-
ment 

  although stung john hand gave no sign the ad-
justors dont work by ordinary methods sir and youve
got to meet them on their own ground when a man
disappears in thin air why you  

  ye feel obliged to seek the aid of einstein-is that it
mr hand

  john hand remained impervious to the others sar-
casm youve got to find out how it happened of
course    he looked earnestly across the desk at his
superior this moment was an important one in john
hands career for two years now he had been on the
trail of the adjustors a trail hard to follow a be-
wildering trail full of gaps false leads and sudden un-
predictable shifts

      	it is difficult to tell much about this unusual
      story without giving away its central mys-
      tery you will learn however the extremes
      to which men go in order to accomplish their
      aims whether such aims he for or against law
      and order

         here in this story we have a scientific in-
      trigue that reaches its hands far into the amer-
      ican nation in the kidnapping mystery and
      the boldness of the kidnappers the contrast to
      the terrible lindbergh case is marked the
      motives behind the kidnappings in this story
      may be compared with the fiendish brutality
      that accompanied the lindbergh tragedy

         at any rate this is a story you should enjoy

  the trail was a long one new york los angeles
tokio berlin paris kimberley stockholm far and wide
it led with john hand following dogged and baffled al-
ways a step or two behind-until now now for the first
time he was a step ahead now at last he felt he could
meet his opponents on even terms he couldnt be sure
of course you could never be sure with the adjustors
but the mere possibility filled him with an exultant ex-
citement for like all born fighters john hand loved a
worthy enemy

  when he next spoke his tone was almost pleading i
believe i can convince you of my usefulness tonight sir
if the adjustors get away with van swerigen fll admit
my failure    but ive got to get to cleveland in a
hurry   

  no-o-    mcquerdle shook his head judiciously
no mr hand i am afraid yeve gone stale on the case
i am going to take ye off it

  but sir youll let me go to cleveland tonight wont
you id stake my life on getting em this time   
give me a last chance sir

  andrew mcquerdle shook his head tomorrow morn-
ing the president leaves washington on his western trip
ye will join his bodyguard mr hand yell have no
time for cleveland

  it seemed to john hand that in this moment he had
reached the climax of long years of dissatisfaction and
unpleasantness on the job he was bound to face the
fact sooner or later that he neither liked nor trusted his
immediate superior in the department he faced it now
andrew mcquerdle did not command his respect-never
had

  it was not merely his rough and graceless manner of
handling his men there was a strange something behind

that-something sly and unsatisfying which john hand
felt rather than understood he remembered peters dis-
charged for bribe-taking peters was honest as the day is
long and peters had known something but john hand
had tried to pump him in vain

  he decided to make a last appeal    but sir-
that is final mr hand ye will make yer formal re-
port on the case with all possible speed so that we can
take care of the matter  ye may go

  john hand did not move i doubt if you could take
care of it he said quietly his face was perfectly calm
but the heavy clouds of grey pipe-smoke billowing towards
the ceiling told a different story prepared as he must
have been for anything that this man might do he could
not avoid a shock of surprise he was being demoted-
reduced to the ranks-taken off the job after two years of
effort and on the very eve of success

	mcquerdle snorted what man of course we can
take care of it ye believe there will be a kidnapping
tonight in cleveland do ye not    then what is to pre-
vent us from capturing the kidnappers

  john hand took his pipe from his mouth and looked
at it thoughtfully they wont be there he said

  eh    

  they will and they wont said john hand obscurely
mcquerdle was irritated after breathing hard for a
minute he said stiffly that will be all mr hand ye
will make yer report   

  i will not make a report said john hand

  andrew mcquerdles mouth dropped open and he
hitched himself forward in his chair ye will not  

  i will not john hand was studying the ceiling with
mild eyes apparently interested in the whirls and convo-
lution of the grey-blue smoke collected there

  mcquerdle mastered his breathing with an effort mr
hand i cannot allow ye to question my authority he
paused but john hand said nothing ye will hand me
the complete report before three oclock

  john hands interest in the ceiling had not waned ap-
parently he was too absorbed to speak andrew mc-
querdles breathing was again becoming difficult ye
may go he said hastily

  john hand went he left the treasury building
crossed pennsylvania avenue entered his bank he in-
quired about his balance and withdrew the whole he
took a taxi to his home and for three-quarters of an hour
talked earnestly to his wife he left her most of the
money and they parted lovingly and as cheerfully as
possible under the circumstances he went to the wash-
ington airport engaged a plane and said to the pilot
new york

  john hand did not want to go to new york he could
ill spare the time but he and his wife had agreed that
he must see gordon wintermaine at once it was with
no little trepidation that he looked forward to the inter-
view

  john hand was one of wintermaines young men-
as they were known in  when the personal mortgage
was still in its experimental stages

now that the personal mortgage is an accepted part
of our daily lives it is hard to understand the excitement
and the almost universal hostility that it caused when
gordon wintermaine introduced it in  now it seems

indispensable then it was denounced as madness they
called gordon wintermaine a lunatic but they could not
disregard him because he was one of the most interest-
ing figures of his time

  he was the scion of a great international banking house
-born to control great sums of money sway govern-
ments make and unmake wars and do all the tremendous
things an international banker does for a number of
years he did those things but he was not cut out for the
work his blood was warmer than an international bank-
ers should be

  his associates looked on in horror while he loaned
money to little struggling european principalities rushed
to the aid of expiring small-town banks and committed
other rash acts-for purely sentimental reasons appar-
ently they complained they feared that the great house
of wintermaine which had stood for centuries as a rock
of financial stability was in danger these fears became
known in  gordon wintermaine got out

  he was a man more interested in human values than
in money values a good man to him seemed a better
investment than a stock certificate he hated those bank-
ers fetishes collateral and security

  a good man needs money he would say he
ought to be able to get it even if he doesnt happen to own
a house or a barn or a diamond ring   

	he was a social thinker articles by him appeared

  regularly in the popular magazines he had one dom-
inating idea  

  the trend of our modern civilization is towards special-
ization-more and more if a man is going to amount to
anything he must be able to do one thing and do it ivell-

  that takes training-years of it    and in the mean-
time-what

  i know a dozen young men who are talented energetic
well-trained-who have every prospect of success yet
they are unhappy why they dont have any money

  their expectancy of earning power is very high in
ten years they will have all they need in twenty more
than they need   but now they worry and skimp and
fret in their poverty and their work suffers and their
souls suffer some of them are married and they have
the added distress of seeing their wives worry and skimp
and fret others want to marry and cant which is a
most injurious condition as everybody knows   

  i truly believe that they are all being permanently in-
jured

  to get anywhere these days a mans got to be an ex-
pert in some line well why not give him a chance
why make him suffer for it  suffering never helped
anybody

  he plunged into his personal mortgage scheme with all
his characteristic energy and enthusiasm john hand had
been one of his first clients and now as he restlessly
paced wintermaines waiting room he remembered his
first interview with the great shaggy square-jawed man
he could still hear the full deep voice

  hand ive looked you up i have ways of finding
things out i know more about you than you do your-
self  i think youre a good man

  now heres what im going to do im giving you a
regular income i yfant you to live comfortably and in
some style-the way you deserve to live if you work
the space coffin



  been having a hard time havent you wife sick-
eh well send her to a sanitarium now

  when your own earnings get up to a certain point-
my secretary will give you the figures-the income stops
and you start paying me back with interest    all
right

  if you dont make good progress on your job the in-
come stops anyway this isnt charity its common
sense

  also remember this if you fall down on your job
youll he hurting me    people are against me they
think im crazy well im not but
the burden of proof is on me and on
you men that im trusting    are
you with me

  john hand was he had enough
confidence in himself and his future for
that also he fairly boiled with in-
dignation when he heard wintermaine
called usurer and mortgager of
souls as he was constantly from pul-
pit and press gordon winteimaine
did not need a publicity agent his
enemies publicized him

  in spite of the storms of protest
however people showed an almost fran-
tic willingness to mortgage their
souls then began the real work-
the picking and choosing wintermaine
had a tremendous personal fortune and
he planned to use it all but he didnt
mean to throw it away consequently
he was the busiest man in the united states before his
project had been launched a month

  knowing this john hand spoke directly and to the
point-when he was finally admitted to the inner office
he told exactly what had happened that day he ex-
plained all the circumstances and he finished you see
sir ive been after them for quite a while now and id
like to catch them myself by which he meant that
having put his whole heart and soul into the job for two
years he must finish it if he were to retain one atom of
his self-respect

  the older mans brows met in a frown you expect
to catch them single-handed he questioned

  yes said john hand the man who catches the
adjustors will have to work alone i am sure of that
mcquerdle would bungle it and the chance would be
lost-forever

  hmm  wintermaine leaned back in his chair
and looked quizzically at the other mr hand are you
sure you are not chasing a ghost

  ghost john hand was really indignant a ghost
that has kidnapped eight of the worlds wealthiest men
in three years a ghost that has collected a cool eight
million dollars in ransom a ghost that-

  hold on a minute smiled wintermaine im not
denying the facts    but he went on very seriously
is it probable-is it possible-that these eight crimes
have been committed by the same hand

  ill admit it seems impossible    began hand but
the other went on

  isnt it more likely that the adjustors is a sort of
catchword or trade mark adopted by any enterprising

gang that wants to throw the local police off the track
i know a number of experienced criminologists who are
of that opinion they actually scoff at the idea of there
being any real adjustors carrying on their operations all
over the world  

  mr wintermaine john hand lowered his voice and
glanced involuntarily around the room heres a fact that
your criminologists dont know every man that has been
kidnapped by the adjustors has been confined in the same
house 

  gordon wintermaine shook his head that is impos-
sible

  it is true each one has described
it to me separately i know every room
every stick of furniture every book as
if i had been a prisoner there myself
it is a four-room apartment it-
but man alive put in wintermaine
excitedly its a physical impossibil-
ity every man kidnapped has been re-
turned home writhin twelve hour after
payment of the ransom isnt that a
fact

  thais a fact

  france - south africa - japan -
sweden-california gordon winter-
maine barked out the names disgustedly
where is this house

  john hand merely shook his head
and wintermaine went on more calm-
ly you must be right about the ad-
justors ill admit that but the
house-no what theyve done is to fix up several places
to look the same i dont see why but-

  there are two small scratches on the library table
close together inoui mitsui of tokio noticed them van
cleef whitney of mew york saw them whitney told me
also of a spot on the bedroom rug the crown prince
of siam explained to me how he made that spot-with a
balky fountain pen i have quite a list of similar de-
tails said john hand quietly

              chapter ii
              a fugitive

	wintermaine threw himself back in his chair and ex-
haled audibly for a time he said nothing and his
face was a picture of bewilderment then but good
god its a miracle    dont any of these men have
an idea how they got there

  they know nothing at all here is a typical case
the victim is riding in his car and smells a strange sweet
odor he wakes up in the house of the adjustors one
man went peacefully to sleep in his own bed and woke
up in the place 

  it is a richly furnished apartment with a fine library
-very comfortable there the victim stays until he
authorizes payment of the ransom 

  how interrupted wintermaine

  by telephone

  what

  yes he may talk to anyone he wishes his wife his
lawyer his business associates even the police it is a

bit ludicrous he is quite comfortable he is alone but
all his wants are provided for one man stuck it out
for five months-but he finally paid now they are not
so stubborn hardy the south african diamond man
paid up and was back home all in- less than a week if
capone were alive he would choke with envy at the
beauty of the racket one million dollars a throw-in
gold

  lord gordon wintermaine shook his shaggy head
after a short silence he said one million dollars in gold
would weigh more than a ton wouldnt it

  a ton and a half

  well how-

  it just disappears

  wintermaine shrugged yes of course i have heard
that but there must be some better explanation miracles
dont happen-at least we like to believe they dont  

  john hand took his pipe out of his mouth and looked
at it thoughtfully its a good enough name for some-
thing you cant understand he said picture a metal
box-or trunk--sitting in a field the agents of the kid-
napped man send a truckload of gold and fill it up its
location has been carefully explained to them by tele-
phone or by radio that night the trunk disappears
it doesnt matter how many hundred policemen are sur-
rounding the field-or whether the roads are blockaded
or what it disappears   and the next morning the
kidnapped man wakes up in his native city and takes a
taxi home

  gordon wintermaine was silent for a long time tap-
ping the polished surface of the desk with his stubby
fingertips finally he took out his watch and looked
at it

  it is ten minutes of three he said and pushed a tele-
phone towards john hand if you were to call up mc-
querdle now you could square yourself with him
couldnt you

  john hand looked at him stonily is that what you
want me to do	

  hell wintermaines temper flared up am i your
master thats what they say about me i buy the
souls of men with my filthy money thats rot   

  i pick men whose judgment i can trust-and i dont
boss em i have no legal or moral right to boss em
but i can still give the advice of a sane man i hope
listen

  if these adjustors or whatever they are can make a
ton of gold disappear they can probably make you
disappear if they can make away with the crown prince
of siam they can certainly handle you

  john hands lean jaw clamped harder on his pipe-
stem i think i can get em he said

  you think    well heres something we both know
if you balk mcquerdle hell break you-and hell jail
you  

  if he can find me said john hand

  wintermaine shrugged broadly and suddenly laughed
all right all right hand i wouldnt stand in the way
of a determination like yours do whatever damn fool
thing you want to as to the money you owe me it isnt
much is it

  im nearly paid up its three thousand

  how much has your wife got

  twenty thousand

  good shell probably need it iwont dun her
ill take a risk on you-and a damn poor risk it is too

  and now that youre in this thing for good he said
suddenly maybe this will interest you   he took a
sheet of paper from a drawer and pushed it across the
desk    addressed to me-postmarked irkutsk siber-
ia if thats any help

  it was typed john hand read

  you are next-the adjustors

  john hand was silent for a long time then he looked
up and said i wouldnt worry very much about this
sir 

  sure of yourself arent you wintermaine smiled

  but john hand did not explain himself further this
development was a surprise to him and he wanted time
to think it over

  silently the men shook hands

	john hand flew to cleveland and paid off the plane

  he telephoned the office of robert van sweringen and
learned that the great man had left for his lake-shore home
at three oclock his wife being sick it was now four john
hand telephoned the lake-shore home   

  no mr van sweringen is not at home he is at his
office in die city    what mrs van sweringen-
who is this speaking please  oh secret service
no mrs van sweringen is not ill would you like to
speak to  

  john hand hung up and leaning against the wall of
the booth cursed softly in three languages then he
took a cab to the city engineers office and studied a
large-scale map of the lake-shore suburbs

  there was much territory to be covered and he needed
help it was discouraging yesterday he could have
commanded half the citys police force and no questions
asked but now   

  he decided to bluff

  at half past four he walked into a police precinct in the
northern part of the city and flashed his gold badge at
the sergeant hand government operative he said
crisply

  yes sir said the sergeant saluting

  colonel van sweringen has been kidnapped he was
overpowered in his car near his home shortly after three
oclock 

 the sergeant gulped whew colonel robert
van-

  i will need every man you can muster to search the
fields in the lake-shore area

  the fields sir

  yes i have reason to believe we will find him there
now make it snappy

  yes sir-yes but ill have to call headquarters
i mean i dont have the authority    the sergeants
voice trailed off as he grasped the phone

  john hand nodded negligently he was filling his
pipe while he lighted it he was doing two other
things he was deciding that his unfortunate lateness
would necessitate the abandonment of his original plans
and he was watching the sergeant narrowly through the
first billowing clouds of smoke the latter had said only
a few words when he stopped and began listening all
the conversation it appeared was coming from the other
end the sergeants mouth dropped open slowly and
the space coffin



then damped shut with a click as he said yes sir and
hung up he turned and looked at john hand queerly

  orders to arrest me-eh john hand was thinking
that mcquerdle never wasted time-never wasted anything
for that matter a remarkable man   

the sergeant was making ridiculous apologies must
be some mistake    orders is orders    have to send
you to headquarters   you wont give any trouble sir
trouble said john hand raising his eyebrows why
should i

   the sergeant had no definite answer for that and called
two officers out of a side room mike he said you
and jerry take the car and take this man down to head-
quarters he wont give any trouble

   and in the mean time what about the good colonel
inquired the prisoner

   theyre taking care of that already sir all the roads
are being watched

   the police have an unfortunate road-watching fixa-
tion said john hand

 yes sir said the sergeant vaguely

   outside it was getting dark the two officers flanking
him held his arms firmly and marched him towards a
small roadster at the curb

   this looks like the end of a perfect day he said
hold me tight

   jocularity with john hapd was always a cloak for less
pleasant emotions he was feeling rather grim mc-
querdle he knew would show no mercy there had al-
ways been a veiled enmity between them now the kid-
napping would succeed and john hand would be blamed
mcquerdle wouldnt miss a chance like that also there
was insubordination that unforgivable offence    the
end of a perfect day the end of a career rather

   john hand stood still suddenly and knocked the ashes
out of his pipe against the palm of his left hand anyone
who knew him would have scented trouble immediately
because it was not half smoked and he always smoked
that pipe to the bitter end a glowing coal lodged in his
hand and he said ow the two officers had stopped
about a foot ahead of him and they were looking at his
hand with concern he said ow again and then
dropped his pipe completely adding damn the two
officers now looked at the pipe

	john hand was one o those tall stoop-shouldered men
that look frail and arent he had american indian
blood in him-a lot of it he had in fact been brought
up on an indian reservation the sports on an indian
reservation arc rough and john hands six and a half feet
of loose-knit power was something of a by-word in the
service -the word handling as they used it was a
poor pun but it had a very real meaning

  his arms described half-loops behind the two police-
men breaking their grips on his biceps immediately his
hands terminated the loops at their throats on the outside
his long fingers dug cruelly into the flesh in front just
above their high collars it was a movement requiring
exquisite precision

  the two policemen made odd snoring noises they
wasted no time in drawing revolvers the one on the
right waved his harmlessly but the other was better
situated john hand felt a hard muzzle pressing his
left side he stepped back arched his shoulders and

pulled the two heads together in front of him they

met with an unpleasant crack a simple shove disposed
of them after that

  john hand snatched up one of their caps retrieved
his pipe leaped over them and tumbled into the little
roadster the key was in the switch    who steals
police cars  a goggle-eyed citizen crossing curious-
ly from the opposite sidewalk saw him drive off in the
dusk

  he headed north the police cap tipped jauntily over
one eye he found the button operating the siren and
made very good time in ten minutes he saw the silver
gleam of lake erie and swung left on the broad shore
drive a little croaking voice behind the dashboard
said accusingly

  police car  stolen by fugitive from justice   
headed north from twelfth precinct    probably on
shore drive moving east or west car  proceed up
lincoln avenue to intercept on east car  proceed
up bond avenue to intercept on west    all other cars
in twelfth district stand by for orders   

  bond avenue if john hand remembered his map cor-
rectly was just two blocks ahead now he pushed the
throttle down flat and his siren rent the air as he
whipped past bond avenue he saw from the corner of his
eye car  approaching but just a little too late to in-
tercept on west

  wonderful thing the radio he chuckled

  the radio said fugitive in police car  is john
hand wanted by federal government also wanted for
assault on two officers and theft of car    tall-stooped
-dark-wearing police cap    men watching city exits
in kidnap case prepare to intercept 

  humph said john hand to his right beyond an
iron fence a large estate lay between him and the lake
in the gathering darkness he could just see the outlines
of the van sweringen mansion set among trees on a
knoll he was thinking hard now about another car that
must have passed this way roughly an hour before he
swept by the van sweringen driveway with its ornate pil-
lars    the other car hadnt turned in there

  fugitive john hand in police car  moving west
on shore drive at high rate of speed said the radio car
 following   john hand glanced back and veri-
fied that two red-tinted lights were there veering craz-
ily -also at high rate of speed he chuckled

  cars  and  from thirteenth district will proceed
east to meet him added the radio wickedly cars 
  and  will close in from the south

  the fugitive frowned and began studying the roadside
to his right trees now rather thick the iron fence had
given away to a stone wall he reached up an arm and
adjusted the spotlight to shine along that wall far ahead
among the white lights of city-bound cars he saw red ones
weaving the wailing of many sirens made the night
hideous

  suddenly he caught the flash of a white barred gate
in the wall stamping on the brake pedal he pulled at
the wheel only the little cars lead weighting kept it up-
right as it swerved from the road and splintered its way
through the gate a hiss and a bang sounded the doom
of a front tire the steering wheel wrenched loose from
john hands grasp and only his right foot caught be-
tween the clutch pedal and the steering post held him in

the car as it struck a tree skidded in a violent arc and
stopped

   cursing at an ominous twinge in his right ankle he
clambered to the ground and struck north through the
trees if he could reach the lake he thought he might
yet escape he was a good swimmer and there would
surely be boats within reach as he remembered the
map there was about a half mile of wooded parkland
and fields between the road and the lake at this point
it was part of the territory he had wanted searched

   well itll be searched now he chuckled not with-
 out satisfaction behind he heard the throb of many
 motors mingled with horn-tooting and shouts beams
 of white light slashed among the trees he was limp-
 ing now and when he tried to quicken his pace he suf-
 fered his first misgivings the ankle was bad

   there was open ground ahead he judged it to be a
field of some size but couldnt be sure because the night
was black there was no moon the adjustors always
worked in the dark of the moon he remembered

chapter iii
imprispned

	a car was coming through the woods-perhaps sev-
eral the shortest way to the lake must be his way
he decided and headed across the field it had been
plowed last spring and now the furrows were hard and
treacherous his ankle felt like a tight blob of flesh
spliced to his foot with red-hot rivets he couldnt get
much further on his feet he realized

   suddenly light bathed the ground around and he
threw himself flat fifty feet ahead he saw a small clump
 of bush the light swung away he crawled into the
bushes and sat up propping his back against a smooth
rounded rock three cars came out of the woods one
of them bumped around the edge of the field to the farther
 side came voices and the banging of doors

   john hand shrugged philosophically and packed his
pipe he scratched a match on the smooth rock and as
it flared there came a dull ringing sound ignoring the
agony of his ankle he leaped to his feet and stared down
at the thing it was not rock it was metal

   well ill be- he doused the match praying it had
 not been seen carefully he felt over the glassy-smooth
 surface of the thing on the ground it was a cylinder
 pointed at the ends something like a torpedo and about
 eight feet long on top were two little posts with a fine
 wire strung between searching further he found a
 small cup-like depression in the side with a metal handle
 sunk in it without hesitation he twisted the handle felt
 the soft sliding of a bolt and pulled the close-fitting
 door-almost an entire side of the thing-swung out slow-
 ly and quietly on its well-oiled hinges john hand heard
 a faint steady hiss and then another sound-the regular
 breathing of a man he flashed his pocket light inside

   robert van sweringen was suspended in the center of
the cylinder held by straps which were attached to the
ends of springs extending from the inner surface he was
asleep as his slow long breathing showed lo the
colonel said john hand

   an exploring light-beam caught the bushes and held

john hand froze concentrating on the voices which car-
ried far in the night

       nothing there sir  

  how the hell do you know theres nothing there
have a look

  the light swung away but little ones were bobbing along
the ground now john hand unstrapped the colonel
lifted him out upon the ground and rolled him away
from the bushes on the side opposite the approaching
lights unable to resist the temptation of the high
starched collar he took his pencil and hastily scribbled
upon it to andrew mcquerdle-with love-j h
returning to the cylinder he removed his gun from his
armpit laid it inside and crawled in after it laborious-
ly he strapped himself in position among the springs
then reached out and pulled shut the heavy door he
shot the bolt and to his delight found a small catch
which held it in position

  theyll need a can-opener to get me out now he
chuckled and perhaps before they find one some-
thing else will happen

  the darkness was complete he fumbled for his lamp
that soft steady hissing sound puzzled him the place
was stuffy and he felt suddenly frightened about air the
door was rubber-sealed even before his lamp revealed
the little tank however he had guessed that the hiss must
be an oxygen valve a queer sieve-like arrangement near
his feet must hold a lime solution for absorbing carbon
dioxide he imagined there was nothing else to see and
he switched off the light his ankle throbbed rhythmi-
cally

  occasionally he glanced at the green glow of his wrist-
watch a half hour passed and still nothing happened
-no sound came he was surprised but thought he
could understand they had tramped through the bush-
es peering perfunctorily then they had found the col-
onel and forgotten all about the bushes

  he was reasonably comfortable he had plenty to
think about and the darkness did not worry him-nor did
the loneliness the oxygen made him a little lightheaded
he felt quite pleased with himself he rested necessity
had taught john hand to take his rest where he found it

  a moment after he had noted the hour of eleven by his
watch there came a deafening nerve-shaking clang on the
wall of his prison startled he found himself shaking
up and down between his supporting springs so violently
that his teeth chattered it did not last however and
soon he was quiet again he resisted an impulse to open
the door something hard was pressing into the small of
his back and hunching up one shoulder he managed to
reach it with his hand it was his revolver

	at first he thought that the cylinder must have rolled
over but the weight of his arms and his general sense
of equilibruim told him that that could not be the case
why then was his revolver not lying properly on the
floor a foot below his back he released it and heard it
strike the cylinder his flashlight showed him where
it was stuck again the top above his head he frowned
at it irritably and pushed it away from his face no
telling what it might do next with knit brows he
puzzled over the matter until nearly midnight when he
began to feel cold

  the wall of the cylinder when he touched it felt like
the space coffin



dry ice here was something new to puzzle about october
nights do not get as cold as all that john hand began
to feel annoyed

  no wonder they give em gas he snorted he wanted
to smoke but knew he couldnt his synthetic atmosphere
was too nicely gauged-for that again he had the impulse
to open the door but resisted it he compromised with
himself by unfastening the catch which held the bolt if
anybody wanted to take him out now he was quite willing

  his flashlight had now joined his revolver at the top
of the cylinder and he even felt his wrist-watch tugging
in that direction his arms head and feet felt light his
ankle which had suffered greatly by the unsupported
weight of his foot seemed relieved at last his right arm
surrendered to the upward pull of the little watch and
hung lazily above him

  further speculation on this matter was interrupted
however by another disturbance from outside he clapped
his hands over his ears and grimaced at the deafening
clamor as something again struck the walls of his prison
once more he was shaking in the springs the bumping
clanging and shaking continued for some minutes and
then suddenly all was quiet his revolver fell from the
roof striking him a sharp blow in the stomach his flash-
light bounced from his hip and broke against the metal
wall filled with a sudden premonition he reached for
the door handle

  it was turning

  he grasped his revolver and pointed it light
streamed in and he felt a rush of warm air he found
himself staring directly into the face of a man john
hand thought it was a surprised face with its wide eyes
and open mouth but he couldnt be sure as to its ex-
pression because it was upside down beyond it he
caught a glimpse of bare walls and floor what supported
the face he could not see

  for a long moment he stared into the inverted face
stupidly pointing his gun at it then noiselessly it was
removed from view-upwards he heard the soft closing
of a door somewhere in the room then complete silence

  he began unfastening the straps which held him the
time had come he felt for action obviously his cylinder
had been moved-where and why he must discover   

  a heavy sweetish smell came to his nostrils and he
sniffed the air suspiciously then he renewed his strug-
gle with the straps trying not to breathe the buckles
were stubborn and his fingers were numb the numbness
was not due to cold swiftly it spread up his arms and
into his body making him sick and dizzy too late he
thought of closing the door he grasped its handle but
could not move it it was as heavy as all the world he
was free of the straps now as he tugged at the door he
seemed to be floating in the air-floating right out of the
cylinder he knewr he must be dreaming darkness
came and he floated in it rolling over and over and over
sickeningly helplessly   

  he next saw the light in a room he knew from a bed he
knew his head ached a little he stirred uneasily and
looked around he rolled over stiffly and gazed down
at the little ink spot on the heavy persian rug near the
bedpost yes this was the bedroom in the house of the
adjustors

  his ankle was neatly bandaged and splinted he knew
that even before he threw back the covers and saw it his

clothes had been taken from him and he was dressed in the
close-fitting grey garment which was worn by every cap-
tive of the adjustors and which could never be taken off
it covered the legs to the ankles and the arms to the wrists
and came high around the neck it was secured with the
metal fastenings called zippers so arranged that they could
not be unfastened by the wearer victims had complained
to john hand that they never got a bath but they had to
admit at the same time that they didnt need one no
speck of dust had ever been seen in the house of the ad-
justors it was the cleanest place in the experience of any
man who had been there there were no windows per-
haps that was the explanation but it didnt entirely satisfy
john hand

  curiosity was his first emotion he hopped through the
rooms inspecting them-the living room the library the
other bedroom everything was neat orderly and in
good taste-almost oppressively so the silence of the
place was so complete that the noises he made startled
him he tried to move quietly but that was almost
impossible on one foot lie had an unreasonable fear
that someone might hear him

	he argued with himself annoyed why shouldnt
someone hear him they knew he was there didnt
they it was no secret to them nothing he could do
would make any difference

  far from cheering him up that thought depressed him
more john hand was not accustomed to feeling help-
less it made him uneasy-jumpy he realized that he
was turning his head constantly suddenly staring over
one shoulder or the other as if wanting to see in all
directions at once also he would stand for long periods
of time perfectly still listening-straining his ears in the
silence-hearing nothing

  he sat down tense and shaking on the edge of a chair
there was something queer about the place he had
sensed it in the descriptions of the men who had preceded
him here he sensed it now but it was too subtle-too
intangible-for comprehension everything seemed so
correct and ordinary yet there was something ivrong he
knew it he sat there struggling to put the feeling into
a concrete thought

  as a boy he had known fear of the dark every nor-
mal boy has felt it that sudden panic-stricken conscious-
ness of an alien presence-an all-encompassing evil
thing which cannot be seen or heard or touched but
which is still very real and terrible

  but john hand had not been a boy for more than twenty
years furthermore it was not dark here globes in the
ceiling spread a soft natural radiance over everything
yet he was afraid

  not of the adjustors true they had every reason to
hate him he had cost them a million dollars and he
was a very definite menace to their safety true he was
entirely in their power still they were men and john
hand could deal with men he had come into this thing
with his eyes open he had gambled on the chance of
their sparing him long enough for him to penetrate their
secrets he had felt confident that once here he could
solve the problem of their mysterious hide-out and their
mysterious powers

  give me six hours in that place he had said con-
fidently to his wife and ill give you the answer  

  yes the mystery was here but he was not solving it
instead he was surrendering to it and shaking with fear
like a nervous woman he clenched his fists and knit his
brows striving to think-striving a second time to give
concreteness to his shadowy impressions

  anybody who could have read his thoughts then would
have called him a lunatic it seemed to him that these
four rooms with their quite ordinary furniture and
decoration were not real at all-that they were merely
screens put there to hide some terrible reality which lay
behind the studied naturalness of everything he saw
was a cloak covering the awful unnaturalness beneath
each table chair vase and book was part of the decep-
tion  and it was a clever deception careful and pains-
taking

  a less impressionable man than john hand-or an un-
suspicious man-might have noticed nothing but john
hand knew that the whole thing was wrong how that
knowledge came to him or what was meant by it he could
not say in fact for whole minutes at a time he feared
he was mad but then he remembered that others before
him had had the feeling

  he was not a man to surrender to panic fear fear re-
mained but he battled it constantly with his reason no
deception is perfect he told himself there must be flaws
in this one and sooner or later he would find them the
very fact that he sensed something wrong proved there
were flaws his subconscious mind-or instinct-per-
ceived them while his reason did not he had run across
that phenomenon many times in his detective work and
he knew what to do

  watch for details never let one little unexplained
fact get past you it might be a clue forget nothing
until it has been well explained and accounted for and
then put it out of your mind completely so that it wont
be in the way treasure all your little unexplained facts
work on them try to fit them together and be on the alert
for similarities among them that was john hands in-
ductive method

  whether or not they would give him time to use it was
another question he realized

  he began examining the one-piece tight-fitting garment
which he wore he could not decide what the material
was it might be wool but it seemed very stiff-stiffer
than any cloth he knew he scratched it with his finger-
nail-there was nothing else to use-and it seemed al-
most hard he made a little shiny place scratching he
hobbled into the bedroom and examined the bedclothes
they were the same

  he returned to the living room and examined his
breakfast which he had ignored hitherto it was kept
hot by a little electric steamer he switched off the cur-
rent the food was in a bowl-unpleasant-looking stuff
of the consistency of gruel or porridge the adjustors
always served food in this form he knew the ingre-
dients might vary but the form and manner of serving
was always the same he tried it gingerly and found it
extremely good with the taste of bacon predominating
he was not hungry however

chapter iv
at bay

	the calendar clock set in the wall told him it was ten-
thirty am october  he wanted to smoke they
had not left him his pipe or tobacco and that irritated
him he didnt want to smoke out of their damned tube
still any smoke is better than no smoke at all and he
went to the wall where two flexible tubes hung down
from a metal panel he knew all about them of course
one supplied drinking water the other tobacco smoke
you signify your wishes for one or the other by pressing
signal buttons there was a supply of changeable mouth-
pieces in a box he was glad of the opportunity of in-
specting these queer arrangements at first hand he didnt
like the tobacco

  he moved over to the telephone and idly picked up
the receiver he was about to replace it when

  yes said a quiet voice

  john hand was a bit taken back

  you wanted something insisted the voice

  john hand said the first trivial thing that came to his
mind i dont- like turkish tobacco

  what tobacco do you prefer

virginia and perique half and half john hand
grinned suddenly this was really funny he thought

  it will be attended to the voice assured him there
came a click

he replaced his own receiver feeling a trifle dazed
so he was to be treated like a paying guest how long

  during the remainder of that day and the whole of
the following day he carried on a minute inspection of
the four rooms he did not sleep but he ate quite heart-
ily the food was undoubtedly good he could recog-
nize various meat and vegetable flavors there was how-
ever one flavor running through it all that was new to
him he could make nothing of it the food came to
him by way of a cupboard in the living-room wall it
had a sliding panel which raised with a buzzing sound
at meal times when he had finished with his dishes he
replaced them and the panel closed

  air was supplied through small grated vents in the
ceilings that sweetish gas of theirs could also be sup-
plied at a moments notice he thought grimly the
knowledge of his complete helplessness did not induce a
feeling of resignation in him as it might have in many
men it increased his restlesness he was a storehouse
of nervous energy the thought of sleep was abhorrent
to him he pursued his investigations doggedly even
when they seemed to be leading nowhere

  he examined the books in the library there was a
fine variety of them-many that he would have liked to
read under different circumstances what interested him
now however was the fact that they were uniformly
bound with thick heavy covers

  he examined all the decorative vases and the bowls
from which he ate they all had one characteristic in
common thick bottoms out of proportion with their other
parts he wondered if he dared break one of them he
might discover something that way

  he was puzzled to know whether he was being watched
he had found nothing to indicate that he was but it
seemed unlikely that they would neglect that precaution
the space coffin

he tried to simulate a certain casualness while pursuing
his investigations so that an occasional watcher would
not be made suspicious

  one form of relaxation he did take more in an at
tempt to lull their suspicions than for any other reason
in the library he found a chess set pasted on the back
of the board was a short typewritten notice

you may play by telephone if you wish

     there is a good player at your service

  he set up the men and played a game with the quiet
voice at the other end of the wire getting rather badly
beaten he was proud of his chess game and excused
himself on the grounds of nervousness

  when the third day came and he had discovered noth-
ing of tangible value his spirits began to fall his con-
fidence in himself was shaken truly these were the
perfect criminals they could hold him a week or a
year it made no difference apparently

  he felt suddenly very small and very unimportant
he was a weak little pawn in their big expert game he
had come to get them and they had treated him with
contemptuous politeness  he had cost them a mil-
lion dollars and they blended his tobacco for him and
played games with him the thought made him flush
hotly

	yes these were super-criminals they were in no

  hurry becausc they had no fear of discovery that
must be the secret of it thought john hand from long
experience he knew that a criminals greatest weakness
is his hurry his fear of discovery is the crack in his
armor remove that and you have given him a new and
terrible strength

  they wouldnt let him go why should they it was
safest for them just to keep him here where he couldnt
do any harm now there rose before his minds eye pic-
tures of his home and of his wifes face-anxious and a
little frightened as he had last seen it mentally he
could hear her voice telling him to be careful as she
always did that had sometimes irritated him he re-
membered with astonishment he had thought it un-
necessary and superfluous he conceived a new horror
of his prison

  but he was not a weak man shortly after noon that
day he seated himself in a chair in the living-room and
attacked ms problem with a new energy-an energy-
born of desperation he must get to the bottom of the
matter soon or admit defeat

  at three oclock he had not moved slumped deep in
his chair with knit brows and blank gaze he still strug-
gled with the mystery  at four his lower jaw was
outthrust and his breathing was harder  at five the
faint suggestion of a smile appeared about his mouth   
and a few minutes before six he leaped to his feet
chuckling with the light of triumph in his eyes

  he went quickly to the library and taking a book at
random from a shelf tore out half a page he crumpled
the paper in his hand and rolled it up into a little
ball he held it out in front of him and then let go
of it he smiled at it sardonically

  the little ball of paper floated before his face john
hand chiickled at it delightedly caught in an air cur-
rent it circled towards the ceiling he reached up and
grasped it and hid it in a book

  he gazed around him with newly seeing eyes under-
standing swept over him like a fresh clean wave the
mystery was a mystery no longer and fear was gone

  john hand went into his bedroom and closed the door
he was virtually certain that they could not watch him
in here he had examined the walls with the minutest
care and had found nothing resembling a peep-hole

  after an hours struggle he found how he could open
the slide fasteners of the garment they had put upon him
he was excited he had read a great deal of science
fiction which was the most popular literary form of the
day in hundreds of stories that he had read the char-
acters found themselves in positions where the earths
gravitational force did not exist and it had always
seemed to john hand that they took it too calmly they
floated around in the air without seeming to be even in-
terested in the phenomenom the science fiction authors
seemed to think that the sensation would be annoying
they emphasized its discomforts john hand thought it
would be fun but he had never hoped for the chance
to find out now therefore he was pleasurably excited

  as he peeled qff the garment he felt as though he were
expanding he stood up with the garment still about
his legs he felt a foot taller his arms floated lightly
they had a tendency to fly up above his head a natural
muscular reaction he thought he squatted down and
took off his shoes they probably had metal insertion
also he thought he dragged the garment from one leg
and then from the other as he held it in his hands he
rolled over forwards he dropped it and pushed against
the floor with his hands in a moment he was floating
in the air the floor sank away from him slowly

  instinctively he tried to right himself to grasp at
something there was nothing he could touch and for
a moment he struggled beating the air with his arms and
legs in foolish panic then his good sense came to his
aid he grinned and relaxed he stretched out luxur-
iously a thrilling sensation of restfulness and comfort
suffused his whole body he watched the ceiling coming
slowly down to him now this was something like it

  there was none of the bodily discomfort or pain which
some of the authors had imagined why should there
be the human body is made to withstand gravitational
strain from any direction a man is comfortable stand-
ing up or lying on his back or on his stomach or on
either side he suffers no agony standing on his head
when he rolls over in bed more than a hundred pounds
of gravitational pull changes directions in his body and
it doesnt hurt him why then should the removal of
the pull cause discomfort john hand found that it
didnt and he was childishly pleased at this vindication
of his own judgment

	what did surprise him however was the wonderful

  restfulness he felt it seemed as though every muscle
in his body was crying out in thankfulness at this new
release from strain this must be as good as sleep he
thought or better new strength seemed to flow
through his veins he breathed deeply and flexed his
muscles with a shiver of pure delight

  he kicked the ceiling and sailed towards the floor
again he was turning slowly now over and over that
was a bit annoying because the room spun around him
he closed his eyes and felt better immediately the sec-

ret of the thing he thought was to be non-resisting you
were helpless of course but what did that matter

  perhaps though a man could learn to handle himself
pretty well he resolved to practice that he made his
way to one wall and then sailed back and forth across
the room diving swiftly

  sport of the gods he chuckled the phrase pleased
him and kept runnning through his mind he forgot
everything else for an hour finally he struggled back
into the garment

  from that time on he was a new man the chief secret
of the adjustors was this at last he had something on
them one success breeds others he began to think
about escape

  on the following morning however he got a shock
happening to wander into the second bedroom he found
a man in the bed there was something familiar about
the big shaggy head on the pillow astounded he recog-
nized gordon wintermaine

  gordon wintermaine was unconscious john hand
knew that there was nothing to do but wait for the effects
of the sweetish gas to wear off he could not help feel-
ing surprised and yet what was surprising about it
there was nothing to prevent the adjustors from contin-
uing their operations as they had warned wintermaine
they werent afraid of him there was no reason why
they shouldnt 

  wait    yes there was a reason why they shouldnt

  john hand smiled in triumph they had underrated
him well let them continue to do so he would take
care not to enlighten them he would have to be very
careful

  gordon wintermaine groaned and stirred on the bed
slowly his eyes opened and took in john hand he stared
dully for a time when a man wakes naturally he is
never really surprised at anything he sees the mind has
a way of adjusting itself slowly and without shock under
those conditions

  hello hand said gordon wintermaine

  hello mr wintermaine how do you feel

  rotten decided wintermaine after a moments con-
sideration he dragged himself to a sitting position
what the hells this he fingered the grey garment he
wore disgustedly

  thats your uniform-as a guest of the adjustors
hand told him lightly

  humph wintermaine frowned around the room
then he looked at john hand again with a sudden glint
in his eyes what are you doing here

  not guilty said hand the relief he felt at having
a companion was showing itself in levity i came in
place of van sweringen now that theyve got me they
dont seem to want to jet me go

  oh wintermaine nodded i wondered what hap-
pened to you

  how did they get you asked hand

  wintermaine ran a hand through his hair i remem-
ber leaving the office last night my chauffeur drove me
up to white plains as usual  at least i thought it was
my chauffeur perhaps it wasnt though just before
we reached home i smelled something sweet    the
rest is a blank

  after a short silence john hand said thoughtfully
its strange i wouldnt have expected it

 why

 i didnt think theyd ever take you theyve taken a
 lot of rich men but-just between you and me-theyve
 never taken a really useful one before    youre not a
 typical victim

 wintermaine smiled wryly maybe they dont share
 your opinion of my usefulness	

 -hand spoke awkwardly im sorry if i put you off
 your guard-very sorry

 oh shut up its not your fault wintermaine
 swung his feet to the floor do they feed you here i
 could eat

 john hand led him into the living room the cup-
 board was open and contained two bowls now hand
 moved them to a table

 pah wintermaine was glaring at the stuff

 not so bad as it looks hand told him cheerfully
 the other agreed with him after trying the food but
 he soon lost interest in eating he looked around the
 room curiously

 where on earth are we

 nowhere said john hand

eh

 hand lowered his voice to the faintest of whispers we
 are not on earth he said

 wintermaine groaned at him ive got a headache
 he objected i wish youd save your jokes till later
 i have a lot to tell you mr wintermaine breathed
 john hand he glanced around the room significantly
 but weve got to be careful wait a while then in
 his normal voice he said come ill show you around
 the place

 he did wintermaine snorted disgustedly at the drink-
 ing and smoking arrangements

 this is a nut-house im going to pay up and get
 out

 good said hand

 maybe i could ransom you too

 i doubt it

 later they wtere in hands bedroom with the door
 closed hand had brought his little ball of wadded paper
 from the library he tossed it in the air together they
 watched it it floated about finally coming to rest in a
 corner of the ceiling

 wintermaine turned a puzzled face to hand what
 the hell    

 i have discovered something hand told him when
 i said we were not on earth i meant it there is no gravi-
 tational force here last night i floated around this
 room like a bird-or an angel i took this off he
 touched his garment theres metal in the weave   
 you mean-magnets

 electromagnets john hand pointed to the polished
 hardwood floor underneath

chapter v

a desperate chance

	wintermaine looked around the room lord

 youd never guess it  i mean  never would have
 he corrected himself smiling are you sure its a
 wonderful deception how about the food for in-
 stance
the space coffin



  their best trick of all it must have been their hard-
est problem theyve managed somehow to mix  in a
metallic substance a chemical triumph id call it   
they couldnt manage with the water though-or tobac-
co   those tubes are clumsy

wintermaine was shaking his head slowly its too
much for me it sounds like science fiction  you
say were off the earth where are we-on the moon
john hand smiled not that far i hope besides
the gravity-

  sure i get you were not on the moon    still
wed have to be a long ways from the earth to lose all
gravity effect wouldnt we

  not necessarily suppose for instance we were re-
volving around the earth that would create a centri-
fugal force opposing gravity we might be quite near
the earth

  how near

  well that would depend on how fast we were re-
volving the nearer we are the faster we must move
oh hell burst out gordon wintermaine this is
science fiction i dont like it youre crazy and youre
trying your best to drive me crazy  if this place is
off the earth for instance how did they bring me here
you came in a sealed cylinder-lifted by an electro-
magnet and cables perhaps 

    on the end of a rope i suppose in his ear-
nestness wintermaine was almost sneering

  possibly

  impossibly

  theres no harm in theorizing said john hand de-
fensively

  sorry said wintermaine quickly go ahead
suppose said hand slowly that this thing were
in-whatever it is-

  call it a ship

  all right suppose that this ship is revolving around
the earth at the same speed the earth is spinning then
it could stay right above the same spot on the earth as
long as it wanted to in a state of natural suspension
now if it had propulsion tubes  

  what do you mean

  tubes that could release expanding gasses  if it
had those it could move about at will nearer the earth
or farther from it-or around it forward or backward
without anybody seeing it

  certainly it is outside the atmosphere it is small
it might be painted grey or black   

  power    air   water    gas for the pro-
pulsion tubes    and what about communication
interjected the older man

  john hand drew a long breath well power would
be easy it seems to me the ship being outside the at-
mosphere would be boiling hot on the sun-side and freez-
ing on the other a simple thermocouple would give you
all the electric power you wanted you could have bat-
teries for storing it so you could go out of the sun any
time    as for air and water-you bring them up from
the earths atmosphere by supply rockets you could
have a radio aerial too and talk to people on earth by
short-waves    also when youve got water and plenty
of electric power its no trouble to get explosive gases
oxygen and hydrogen-by electrolysis

  lord wintermaine was visibly impressed youve

  got it worked out havent you  just the same its
still fiction it might make sense from the science angle
but it never would from the business angle the thing
would cost too much

  john hand nodded unhappily yes he agreed it
certainly would  he wrestled with that problem in
silence for a time then still you might look at it this
way-the ship has the whole world at its mercy so to
speak in time-

  rats snapped wintermaine no man could ever
get his money out of it in his lifetime and he certainly
wouldnt build the thing for the sake of his descendants
john hand had to agree to that

  but look here went on gordon wintermaine brisk-
ly im making a fool of myself arguing with you like
this youve got a theory-and thats more than ive got
ill tell you what ill do when i get back home or back
to earth if you like ill pass the tip to every observa-
tory in the world if the astronomers cant find you then
youre not in the sky and well have to hunt somewhere
else maybe one of em has caught a glimpse of the ship
already without suspecting what it was   oh rats he
finished with a laugh its science fiction

   they let it go at that

	john hand had not given up his plan to try to escape
from the apartment but he said nothing about it to the
other that afternoon they played three very enjoyable
games of chess gordon wintermaine spoke to the quiet
voice on the telephone blasphemously authorizing pay-
ment of a million in gold for his ransom at dinnertime
unseen by the other john hand placed a chessman under
the sliding panel of the food cupboard saying that he
was tired-the truth-he went to bed at eight for the
first time during his captivity he slept but at two-thirty
he was creeping silently out of his room

  his ankle was by this time quite serviceable he lis-
tened outside the other bedroom until he heard winter-
maines heavy regular breathing he crept into the living
room

  the chessman was wedged under the sliding panel he
pushed his fingers into the crack it made and raised the
panel noiselessly he did not yet know whether he could
get his long body into that cupboard but he meant to try
he succeeded

  the necessary posture was back-breaking he consid-
ered what his next move should be he had no idea of
getting through the adventure unseen in fact his first
plan had been to secret himself there until breakfast time
and grapple with the waiter when that functionary should
appear he wanted information and he didnt much care
how he got it that was his attitude

  but now he reconsidered he couldnt stay bent up like
this until morning should he go to bed and come back
later or should he try to go farther now unaided by
the waiter

  no harm in trying he thought he felt around the edge
of the inner wall of the cupboard there was a crack
it must be another panel he thought he managed to get
his fingernails under it but it wouldnt move

  he was balked there was nothing remotely resembling
a tool in the four rooms there wouldnt be of course
he started to crawl out of the cupboard then he had an
idea


wonder stories for august 

  this cupboard had two sliding panels opposite each
other when one was open the other must be closed
perhaps the arrangement was automatic  slowly he low-
ered the panel through which he had come when it was
nearly to the bottom he heard a click now he tried the
other and it came up easily he closedthe other one all
the way

   he was looking into the strangest corridor he had ever
seen it was about twenty feet long but it was twice as
deep the floor of it was twenty feet below him in the
ceiling the same distance above soft lights burned it
was narrow and its walls were like cliffs facing each
other-cliffs with doorways in them like gulls nests all up
and down the surface

  for a minute he was completely bewildered then he
saw the reason for it the inhabitants of this place did
not use gravity the artificial gravity of the prisoners
apartment was not for them they flew and floated stair-
cases were superfluous now he saw projections all over
the walls which must be handholds

   with a slight grimace he launched himself into the cor-
ridor floating horizontally he checked his flight at the
first doorway scratching and grabbing at the wall and
peered through it the room was a kitchen he saw in-
 stantly no one was in it he was glad of that

  he reflected if he went batting around at random he
was sure to run into someone soon and then his flight
would be rudely checked what he wanted to do was to
get to the outside of this structure

  with this idea in mind he plunged downwards to-
wards a doorway at the bottom of the corridor on the
end sailing warily through this aperture he found him-
self amon machinery the room was full of it levers
dials gauges and switches no one was in this room
either he was surprised at that didnt they tend their
machinery the whole place had a deserted aspect for
that matter it was silent as a tomb if they were going
to let him alone like this thought john hand he might
discover a great deal

  then he saw the window it had a bluish gleam the
blood of mounting excitement throbbed in his temples
he made his way to the window

  good god

  the exclamation was wrung from his lips by what he
saw before him lay a great deep sea of beautiful
diaphanous blue behind this opalescent curtain he could
see dimly shapes which were familiar to him there was
a long wavering indented line-light on one side dark on
the other there were other lines the courses of which
he had known from boyhood  an outline map the
great lakes the atlantic coastline

  a thrill of mingled triumph and awe shook his very
soul he had been right right    but oh god
what a difference between the theory and the actuality
the immensity of the spectacle left him weak and sick he
muttered and babbled to himself brokenly  so far
away what was he-so far away from the good earth
he trembled with that awesome emptiness between
could he still be a living breathing man or was he
dreaming or was he dead

	the absurdity of the last idea helped him to conquer his
fit of terror he came out of it laughing weakly he
was thinking now what a feeble creature he had turned

out to be when it came to real scientific adventure a real
science fiction hero would have glanced casually out of
that window taking stock of his position without batting
an eye probably he would have been quite bored because
the earth was so near he would have longed for the far
reaches of the outer moon of jupiter-or some place like
that where a man could get a thrill above all he would
have been practical in his attitude-not emotional john
hand resolved firmly to emulate the science fiction hero
even if it killed him he looked out of the window again

  this time-benefitted by his new attitude-he saw a
thing that was of more immediate interest than the earth-
and much closer it was attached to the ship it was a
huge windlass-or winding drum and from it there ex-
tended towards the earth a great shining cable he fol-
lowed the cable with his eye-farther and farther into the
blue until it was lost there the drum was unwound

  suddenly he was startled by a sound somewhere in the
ship behind him with clumsy haste he turned himself
around and pushed away from the window he found that
he was floating swiftly towards a row of levers he
stretched out an arm to check his flight his hand slipped
on a smooth metal surface and his whole forearm plunged
down among the levers immediately the entire room
seemed to lurch sidewise the opposite wall rushed to-
wards him and struck him a stunning blow he grasped
blindly with both hands for something to steady him

  you fool what have you done

  the voice was harsh but it had a familiar ring he
managed to turn himself gordon wintermaine was in
the doorway glaring at him his face very flushed john
hand stared at him stupidly for a moment then his
nostrils flared out 	

  he snapped how did you get down here winter-
maine

  wintermaines eyes wavered for a split second then
i found the door unlocked the door in the living
room

  you did not john hands voice crackled his face
was very pale little knots of muscle stood out at the
base of his jaw

  wintermaine came into the room making for the row
of levers john hand moved to intercept him his hands
bent like claws

  let me alone you fool wintermaines voice was a
hiss

  suddenly the room lurched again-downwards this
time the ceiling came down and struck both men heav-
ily they heard a harsh squeal of rending metal win-
termaine screamed and floated towards the window
mouth wide open his face now ashy pale john hand
at last gaining control over his wallowing body followed
cjose

  wintermaine turned from the window with a mad
shout its gone

  stunned by the mans vehemence john hand gasped
dully wintermaine went on yelling in breathless stac-
cato

  you moved the ship    the cable was out    the
cable caught    the cable is gone damn you-its
gone

  john hand understood at last now he could see
through the window the drum of the windlass was
naked no cable stretched away from it the earth
the space coffin



swung crazily around beyond amid a black star-studded
sky

  now gordon wintermaine was at the levers jerking
them desperately staring into the faces of dials and
gauges the room leaped wildly around them

  wintermaine finished with the levers the room
quieted-became motionless wintermaine turned and
faced john hand the two men stared at each other
both were deathly pale they stared into each others
eyes and the eyes of both glittered strangely in the
little metal room was the silence of death

  then wintermaine started speaking his voice was a
lifeless whisper

  we axe alone here john hand    all my men have
returned to earth they returned last night-by the
cable    the cable is gone now    we are alone
here john hand you and i    and the circumstances
are such that-only one of us cm ever return

  then john hand knew that the time had come when he
must fight for his life he was quite calm about it
carefully he put both feet against the wall behind him
with his knees bent deliberately he lunged winter-
maine watched him and smiled coldly

  too late john hand saw his mistake he was floating
straight at the other helplessly he had no way to stop
wintermaine was gripping the edge of a shelf with his
hands he raised both feet and bent his knees john
hand folded his arms over his head trying to protect it
when he was close enough wintermainei kicked out
cruelly the shock sent streaks of fire through john
hands head and flung him back across the room through
a mist of pain he saw wintermaine passing through the
doorway he heard the resonant clang of the metal door
he fought his way towards the door

chapter vi
into the space coffin

	as he reached it he heard a rushing hiss in the room

  and his tortured lungs inhaled the sweetish smell he
fought and struggled at the door until blackness came

  the blackness roared it roared loudly and sparks
shot through it occasionally a great fiery-yellow globe
would shoot across it and then he couldnt see the sparks
for quite a while gradually they would reappear
then would come the fiery globe again so it went
over and over again

  but the roaring was les and less and the sparks were
becoming quieter in their movements now they moved
in regular files across the blackness like a parade they
looked like stars he thought

  the realization came to him that he was conscious and
that his eyes were open they were stars the blackness
was the sky the fiery globe shot across putting out the
stars that was the sun

  he tried to move but couldnt he couldnt move any
part of his body he felt as though he were molded in
iron then he saw that he was looking through glass
he was in a case he saw the dark metal around the
edge of the glass he was in a metal case which in turn
was encased in glass

  he began to think the glass was yellow otherwise
the sun would have blinded him but why were the sun

and the stars wheeling around him with the speed of ex-
press trains

  his mind became stronger he was turning-not they
now he discovered that he could move his arms and legs a
little if he tried hard when he moved his head some-
thing flashing yellow caught his eyes this interested
him the next time his head was turned that way he saw
something he had not noticed before it was a big bulk-
cube-shaped the sunlight glared on it yellowly it was
near to him and seemed to float in the emptiness

  now he could stop himself from turning and control
his movements he was very glad of that now he saw
the earth with its blue sea of air on the other side of
him the sun shone on a thing which he slowly realized
must be the ship

  it was really a ball-a tremendous black ball with a
great winding-drum attached he stared at it wondering-
ly for a long time

  then he turned his attention to the cubicle bulk-a little
island in space it was dertainly yellow it was made
of pieces of yellow stuff in the shape of bars it was
some time before he realized that it was gold

  it was bound around and around with heavy wire

  in his case on one side hand caught a white glare
looking closer he saw two sheets of paper there were
typewritten words upon them

  resting himself comfortably he brought the glass of
his helmet close to the paper and read

my dear hand

  you have a fair chance of reaching the earth alive
if you keep your head i shall tell you what to do

  but first let me express my regret that our last meet-
ing was so unpleasant i am an old man and my temper
is very uncertain the fault was entirely mine i hope
you will accept my apologies for i have a great favor
to ask of you

  you are now dropping slowly towards the earth your
rate of fall will accelerate rapidly when you get nearer
to it of course a parachute is strapped to your back
the rip-cord is attached to the right side of your helmet
and also opens the glass coffin in which you are pull it
when the friction of the earths atmosphere begins to
heat your case

  you are in the space-suit which we used to make re-
pairs on the outer surface of the ship we had only
one of them

  floating to earth with you is four tons of gold-
approximately it is all the gold we collected in the
form of bullion the greater part of our ransoms we
collected in coins which are easy to use they have all
been made use of see where it comes to earth if pos-
sible i hope it will not be lost there is no other
way to return it

  your descent should take about eight hours you
are not revolving with the earth you will stay in the-
sunlight when you are in the earths atmosphere it
will drag you with it and by the time you land you
will be revolving with the earth

  i cannot be sure where you will land but i have tried
to make it as safe as possible for you your suit will
float in water proceed directly to washington taking
the gold with you if possible you need not worry
about andrew mcquerdle

  may god go with you if you die i shall know it


wonder stories for august 

and the short remainder of my life will be a living hell

	john hand paused for a moment in his reading to gaze

  up at the great metal ball hanging in space above
him he wondered if gordon wintermaine were watch-
ing him somehow he could not doubt it he read on-

  as i write you are lying unconscious beside me you
are a brilliant man yesterday you described my ship
to me almofet as well as i could have done it myself there
is little i can tell you

but since i have much  time in which to write and
you will have time to read i will explain a few matters

  i did not build the ship my brother george win-
termaine built it you may never have heard of him
he was a scientist-brilliant but wildly impractical he
dreamed of traveling to the moon i never even knew
it until after his death secrecy was his fetish he built
the ship in secret he borrowed money in secret

  the ship would not go to the moon i think the dis-
appointment helped to kill my brother george after his
death i learned of the ship-and of the ruinous debts
i will never know how he succeeded in borrowing so much
money he used his name craftily-and mine the ship
ate up millions he was a fanatic-unbalanced a little i
fear

  i paid the debts it all but ruined me

  my work-what people call the personal mortgage-
is very dear to me in a moment i saw it wrecked i
was forced to refuse all applicants i faced the prospect
of having to cut off the incomes of my young men-yours
among them by the way

  i tried desperately to get capital for my work i failed
completely billionaires refused to risk a cent to help
me they would have lent me millions to buy stocks
but they would risk nothing on my life work i was bit-
ter it seemed to me that the world was all wrong and
needed adjusting

  then i had a wild idea perhaps i could make the
ship pay for itself i summoned the man who had been
my brothers assistant together wre worked and our ef-
forts met with success

  you are wondering how wc got the ship off the earth
the rocket propulsion tubes could not do it alone the
other man had an idea

  as you know the surface of a metal sphere is the best
storehouse of electricity we charged the surface of the
ship with millions of volts then we discharged it using
that tremendous power to create a magnetic field opposed
to that of the earth as a result the ship was momen-
tarily deprived of weight our rocket tubes did the rest
it could never be brought back that way of course

  the ship did its duty it paid for itself and it tided
me over the worst two years of my life now my work is
safe great and wealthy men have at last seen the value
of it a great corporation is being formed at this mo-
ment

  i said my work was safe it is not one man could
ruin it all    you-and you alone-could wreck it

  when you came to my office in new york just five
days ago i did not fear you i underrated you i had so
easily tricked you in the kidnapping of ostermann he
was lying in a cylinder on the roof of his own house while
your army of searchers combed the grounds but you
profited by that failure and discovered more than i ever

dreamed you could when i learned you were in the ship
i thought i could safely let you stay there then i began
to fear that i had again underrated you-as it proved 
had i came to you-pretending to be kidnapped-to find
out how much you knew when  found that you knew
almost everything i decided to abandon all operations
forever i gave the prearranged signal for the men to
leave the ship when i agreed to pay the ransom over
the telephone the men got safely away they will
never be discovered or identified and they are not aware
of my identity

  i am an old man i cannot return to earth i am not
afraid to die one thing only am  afraid of if it were
known that i headed the adjustors my great work would
die with me there is much public hostility to it still the
truth about my criminal activities would sound its death
knell

  i ask you to keep my secret that is all i hope you
will give careful consideration to the matter

  now i shall say goodbye when i have learned of
your safe arrival on earth i intend to explode my lower
rocket tubes and leave this earth forever perhaps i shall
reach the moon which my poor brother george never
reached perhaps i shall go further

  kindly remember me to your lovely wife whom i
once had the great pleasure of meeting allow me lo
emphasize the great esteem and admiration which i hold
for you

                  your friend

                    gordon wintermaine

	john hand looked up again at the black ball in the sky

  scarcely visible now-smaller and more remote then
he looked down at the earth its blue sea of air was ex-
panding towards him it now filled half the sky be-
hind the soft curtain he could see the great globe slowly
turning his mind ranged back through the years a
picture rose before his memorys eye it was a composite
picture built of several little scenes

  he saw his wife leaning over a hot stove in a room
which also contained a bed he saw her selling underwear
in a large department store he saw her lying in the bed
in the room with the stove ill and pale he saw himself a
government employee leaning heavily over his desk sick
with worry

  then had come gordon wintermaine

  another picture rose he saw his wife on the sunny
lawn of a mountain sanitarium he saw her at her type-
writer doing the work she had always longed to do he
saw her driving a little car up a tree-lined drive to a white
house with green shutters and he saw himself striding up
the steps of the treasury building taking them two at a
time feeling quite a man

  he looked down at the earth where it rolled slowly
he looked up    the little ball was lost in the black
sky suddenly he felt very lonely

  he had a feeling that the little blak ball had been a
more friendly thing than the rolling earth below its
great mottled sphere did not look comforting it ap-
peared menacing rather he had a feeling that it would
rush murderously up at him suddenly he found him-
self watching it fearfully lest it take him by surprise he
felt for the cord of the parachute nervously and had a
the space coffin



momentary panic when he could not find it with his clumsy
gauntlet

  he remembered that he was a science-fiction hero and
tried to be practical but there didnt seem to be any-
thing to do after he found the cord he fell to watching
the earths surface-at first idly then anxiously a small
continent had rolled away-australasia and now a broad
ocean lay beneath him it made him shiver

  things began to happen more swiftly now almost be-
fore he knew it he was well into the atmosphere the
faint blue color of it extended on all sides of him the
earth began to loom large in his sky would that ocean
never pass at last a faint dark shore-line appeared and
he grinned with joy but it seemed to come around so
slowly he reflected that the air must be pushing him
around now too and groaned when he opened the
parachute the air would push him more he resolved to
wait until the last possible moment to do that

  now he imagined that his glass coffin was getting warm-
er he tried not to think about it soon however there
could be no doubt about it he even felt the heat beating
against his skin he closed his eyes and waited as long
as he could stand the heat in an agony of suspense then
he looked down

  land was beneath him

  now he acted as swiftly as he could he fumbled with
the rope and tore it from his wrist he jerked viciously
at the cord attached to his helmet with a sigh of relief
he felt a strong upward pull the gold dropped away

  he suffered agonies of burning gritting his teeth he
glued his eyes on the yellow glint of the gold now seen
against the dark green of a forest

  then the burning heat subsided blazing white sand
replaced the forest under him he floated it seemed to
him four hours he passed directly over a mud-walled
village built around a clump of fethery palms soon
after that the ground began to come up fast he crunched
into the sand was dragged a ways and then lay still

  his could not tell how long he lay there he heard
nothing and saw nothing until a shadow fell over the
glass of his helmet and a black face gazed into his there
were other black faces behind and shining naked bodies
anxiously he looked into tee faces for signs of intelli-
gence    suppose they were to take him for a god or
something and let him starve in there their mouths
were gaping-their eyes wide with awe it was evident
that they did not dare to touch his metal suit he cursed
futilely inside

  then they broke away and he was grinning with re-
lief into the face of a young man under a sun-helmet
he felt the young man working on his helmet after
what seemed a long time the helmet was drawn off over
his head

  thanks he gasped the dry sand felt good in his
hair

  perfectly all right you know the young english-
man true to his national creed refused to show excite-
ment or astonishment he would not ask questions or
show a trace of curiosity until after john hand had been
made comfortable and fed i say ill have to find a
spanner before i can get you out of this mess all sorts
of bally nuts and bolts and things   

  theres one thing- john hand gasped he felt
weak now and speech did not come easily -my-my
baggage--fell in forest-due east

  the young man was solicitous right you are ill
send a couple of these boys for it   

  its-heavy  four tons 

  oh i say the other was taken aback that
wont be easy what i mean to say is this is it im-
portant  i mean-is it valuable

  its-gold said john hand

	a month later john hand arrived in washington con-
siderably ahead of the gold and went directly to me-
querdles office mcquerdle was not at his desk his
assistant said to john hand

  secretary doan wanted to see you sir the moment
you arrived

  john hand went to the office of the secretary of the
treasury and was not kept waiting

  doan was a small lively man with a big head who
rubbed his hands together feverishly as though needing
an outlet for his bubbling energies his speech was sharp
staccato

  come in hand-come in  great heavens man its
good to see yoijj sit down sit down well well
well

  how do you do sir said john hand

  went to see mcquerdle did you pursued the other
ha ha went to report to mcquerdle ha ha ha
hands questioning look appeared to amuse him tremen-
dously dont want a little trip to atlanta do you
hand    report to the old boss in the federal peni-
tentiary ha ha

  john hand completely bewildered said nothing

  the secretary of the treasury became suddenly ser-
ious mcquerdle was a scoundrel hand-a thieving
scoundrel i always thought he was too smart but i
may as well -admit it wasnt i that found him out im
telling you this hand because youre taking mcquerdles
place and because youll keep your mouth shut win-
termaine didnt want it known 

  wintermaine john hands interruption was entirely
involuntary

  doak leaned forwards across his desk and spoke in a
low tone gordon wintermaine broke mcquerdle the
day after you disappeared he sent me a pile of evidence
big enough to jail ten mcquerdles wintermaine knew
a lot of things he never told i guess   

  there was a great man hand-a great man and a
good man

  john hand merely nodded not at all sure of his ground
-and to think that he should have been killed by the
adjustors    im glad youve busted em up hand a
wonderful job    we got a radio message from them
today said it was their last said they regretted the
death of gordon wintermaine said it was an accident-
he tried to escape and was shot said they were through
for good now said wed never hear from them again   
do you think we can count on that hand

  yes said john hand softly you can count on that

the platinum planets

by george b beattie

	long long ago in the thirty-first century one greatorex

  xix  achieved the distinction of being the first man
to visit all the planets in the solar system he was a
man of parts a sculptor as well as a daredevil and be-
tween his voyages he whiled away the time by carving
exquisitely from materials he had brought from the plan-
ets figures representative of the characteristics of each
worlds people

  from a block of the purest venus alabaster he wrought
a life-like effigy of a venusian maiden entitling the work
beauty the crafty men-ants of mars he hewed out
of martian granite and called the group cunning he
imprisoned the hot vapors of mercury which on our cold
crust solidified into a metallic ball and from this he fash-
ioned a miniature of the hideous giant worms with hu-
man skulls which infest the planet and drag the hapless
traveler into the sulphurous pools in which they squirm
this he called cruelty

  the flat disc-like amoeba of the outer planet of eternal
twilight pluto he modelled into the very embodiment of
sloth on stormy jupiter hs found a race revelling in
an orgy of superstition and devil-worship the inspiration
for his statuette awe riding the waves of the semi-
fluid surface of neptune like gulls on the ocean were the
neptunian bird-men whose simple integrity earned for
them the title honesty while the delicate insects of
saturn he honored with truth on uranus greatorex
encountered no sign of life save for the swarms of mon-
strous pythons issuing from the crumbling stones of the
ruined temples relics of a long vanished civilization in-
deed he narrowly escaped with his life when securing the
block of stone from which he carved the uranian master-
piece despair

  the figures were small not more than a foot in height
but they were exquisitely wrought by a master-hand when
they were finished greatorex coated them with platinum
so that they might be preserved to posterity and set them
up in a little studio at the side of his house with other
relics of his voyages for public edification then wan-
derlust seized him again and he set out for the asteroids

  when the explorer returned he found gone all that the
earth held for him war had blasted the world once more
with its foul breath and his fair country had been over-
run with the african hordes true the invader had been
beaten out again but greatorexs wife and children had
fallen victims to deadly rays of the combatants unwit-
tingly murdered in their own home

  greatorex had tarried so long in the asteroidal belt
that the terrestrial war had been almost forgotten by the

     	there will undoubtedly come a day when
     adventurous men will believe that the earth
     is too small for them and they will feel the
     lure of the great vast mysterious spaces beyond

         to such men no danger no distance will be
      too great to encounter to satisfy their desire for
      unusual experiences each solar planet will have
      its own bizarre features its own dangers its
      own fascination here then is adventure to
      last men for some centuries to come

         mr beatties reason for writing this story
      however is not simply to show the future possi-
      bilities for adventure he wants as he says
      to deal a death blow to superstition and to
      show that behind every belief in superstition
      there must exist some scientific basis

         all in all he has written a thrilling and un-
       usual story

combatants the madhouses were full of unfortunates
blighted by brain-destroying rays but these asylums were
in remote spots well out of sight and therefore out of
mind so completely indeed had the horrors of the late
war faded from the public mind that the american gov-
ernment was actually raising a loan to help the defeated
side to put its country in shape again

  fresh from the unknown the ghastly business felled
greatorex like a pole-axe he cried to his countrys lead-
ers for vengeance while they were already playing check-
ers and clinking glasses with their late antagonists the
leaders laughed the diplomats deprecated the soldiers
scoffed but the explorer burned with thoughts of retribu-
tion for iron had entered his soul

  how finally with a few kindred souls he descended
on africa and under the very noses of the soldiery he
stole the black crown prince from the palace and smug-
gled him to his fastness would take too long to tell how
he tortured the stalwart black and finally killed him on the
spot where his wife had died would prove too harrow-
ing while how from the thigh bone of his victim he
sculptured the last of the effigies representing the earth
is a tale that has been told many times before

  it is a hideous piece a grinning dervish whose whole
poise and glance seems to emanate evil is slowly crush-
ing the life from a woman prostrate beneath his heel while
the fiend has impaled her babe upon a bayonet

  greatorex covered the grisly relic with platinum and
called it slaughter he set it up with the other statuet-
tes in the studio took off in a solo space boat and disap-

peared into the stellar void once more he was never
seen again

	at any rate that is the legend although of course at
such a remote date it would be very difficult to vouch
for its impeccable veracity on every point there can be
no such doubt however with regard to the curious super-
stition which grew up regarding the platinum planets
as the figures came to be called naturally they were not
allowed to remain long in the shrine a distant relative
arose obtained papers presuming the explorers death and
in double-quick time he auctioned the effects in this
manner the planets became widely separated collectors
from various parts of the world vieing one with another
for possession

  as the centuries rolled on the platinum planets
gained in value until the set became a synoym for the
unattainable or impossible much as in an earlier age
one would talk of going to the moon for a pound of green
cheese so one would now talk of getting together the set
of the planets from time to time wealthy men did
actually succeed in accomplishing the feat but on each oc-
casion on which this happened such a train of disaster
engulfed the owner that the set was disbanded very much
more speedily than it had been got together the super-
stition eventuated that the nine figures could never be
housed under one roof without a dear ones blood being
shed

  indeed in that hysterical age in the eighties follow-
ing the devastating yellow war more than one fanatic
laid the whole blame for the war on the american art
commission who had saved these historic pieces for the
nation and had placed them in a special museum after
much controversy ignace pascal a millionaire crank
following out his theory that peace on earth could never
be until each piece had been returned to the planet it repre-
sented purchased them and set about putting his theory
into practice

  how far he succeeded no one ever know for he and
his unfortunate crew were believed although concrete evi-
dence of this was never forthcoming to have perished in
the terrible storm clouds of jupiter howbeit as time
passed the world forgot the platinum planets but the
legend was banded about by the superstitious like a tale
from greek mythology

	  

  for a mere babe of thirty years jackthorpe r had
a pretty wit and a pleasing intelligence he could de-
bate with the master scientists of ten times his years
with a profound assurance and a cool cheek which car-
ried his point much more easily than dry academic argu-
ment would have done add to this the fact that he
and his baby brother owned half of the lunar
radium fields and you will readily gather that jack-
thorpe was a young man who usually got what he wanted

  physically he was always in marvelous trim even for
a fiftieth century man and had but to hear of some new
scientific adventure to embark straightway upon it his
only care was his little motherless brother to whom he
would relate the hairsbreadth escapes and bloodcurdling
encounters he had had in visiting the other planets at an
age when the average infant was content to be informed
that mary had a little lamb

as the years passed jackthorpe minor or r as he

was officially designated or again bunch as jack
lovingly called him would beseech his brother to take
him aboard every time the asteroid the great red space-
llyer was being prepared for a further interplanetary
trip but jack always laughingly shook his head and
wagged his finger with itsnot a kids game bunch
wait till you grow and although his whole brain
was teeming with visions of the great universe of peril
and adventure perforce bunch had to wait

  by the time he was thirty-five there was hardly a thrill
in the whole universe which jackthorpe r had not
sampled and the prospect of having to settle down to an
average life of six or seven hundred years listening to
the radioed market reports and making speeches in con-
gress that nobody wanted to hear appalled him yet
that was what all members of his class were expected to
do once they had reached maturity and as he ap-
peared to have exhausted the complete list of possible
adventures there really seemed nothing else for it still
that did not prevent the prospect plunging him into a
deep gulf of depression

  just when the world seemed bluest he heardthe legend
of the platinum planets in his life of action jack
had no place for superstition it was an ugly thing to
be trodden underfoot like a venomous asp and if one
thing more than another was calculated to rouse his ire
it was any suggestion of the dark workings of super-
natural forces

  here then was a golden opportunity not to be missed
of enthusing life with the spice of adventure and at the
same time of dealing a shrewd blow at his pet aversion
wherever they were he would collect together the dreaded
effigies and exhibit them as an eternal reminder of the
triumph of scienc over the dark forebodings still lurking
at the back of the mind of the moderns as legacies from
prehistoric man

  with jackthorpe thinking meant acting and almost be-
fore one could repeat projected platinum planets plane-
tary pursuit he was leaning over the bow of the asteroid
and mumbling the familiar words no bunch not this
time its not a kids game wait till you grow

	nearly a year later as we count time on earth the as-
teroid was moored on the jovian satellite i and jack-
thorpe was facing a disgruntled and well-nigh rebellious
crew

  its no good im afraid confessed captain drake as
he returned from a conference with the men theyre
simply scared stiff of what lies below he pointed sig-
nificantly through the port window to the whirling tem-
pestuous belts of heavy gases clinging to the rapidly-turn-
ing planet jupiter

  after all he continued its hardly human to expect
them to plunge themselves into that tornado an atmos-
phere six times as thick as our earthly one whizzing round
at two hundred and fifty miles an hour and for what 
ask you ten to one to be toasted to a cinder by the in-
herent heat of old man jove  its blinding even from
here

  the captain shaded his eyes as a rift in the angry clouds
momentarily exposed the brilliant red light from the in-
ner planet the famous red spot which had so baffled
the early astronomers

  and suppose we do get through the thousand mile belt
the platinum planets



of cyclones what then most likely well finish up being
cooked over a slow fire by those bone-hunters below and
for what i ask again because the little dicky-bird men
on neptune whispered to you that most of the trinkets were
after are being worshipped somewhere down on that crust
a few inches of hardware on a planet thats two hundred
and eighty thousand miles round the waist eleven times as
much as the earths circumference with a gravity so in-
tense and an atmosphere so heavy that well be lucky to
make a mile a day once we land i tell you sir its
hopeless

  jack looked up smilingly never-
theless his jaw was thrust out at an
angle and there was a steely look in
his eyes wthich captain drake knew
well

  youre a rotten advocate captain

you have understated the case by a
thousand per cent the dangers and
hardships we shall encounter are many
times greater than you have indicated

all the same we are going

  and that as captain drake well
knew was that the men went about
their tasks sullenly the asteroid was
overhauled thoroughly every bolt and
rivet receiving the keenest scrutiny so
that the great ship might withstand the
terrible buffeting it would receive in
the whirlwinds

  jack encouraged them and drake
bullied them but it was clear to see
that every day was bringing them nearer and nearer to
open mutiny defiant glances exchanged as jackthorpe
passed and the work proceeded to an accompanying ob-
ligato of muttered curses and threats

  when at length the great ship rose from the surface of
the satellite an ominous calm reigned the calm before
the storm within an hour they were battering an angry
mob on jacks stateroom door demanding that the ship
be turned towards home and hurling ugly threats at
jack and the captain jackthorpe was coolness itself

  who is your leader he asked and the words came
like the retorts from a lewis gun

  a big bully of a man with a bald cranium like a hard-
boiled ostrich egg gruffly claimed the honor

  then take the helm and see what you can do with it
the ships yours

chapter ii

into the fury

	with a great bellow the men ran forward the big
fellow martin yt by name in his excitement
roughly threw the helmsman aside and took charge of
the wheel which determined the direction in which the
series of rockets should discharge a look of blank
amazement passed over his ugly countenance and was
reflected a dozen times on the faccs of the dumbfounded
crew for not an instrument showed the slightest devia-
tion from the original direction the ship was hurling
itself towards jupiter at an ever-increasing pace and
the helm refused to answer

  jaok and the captain had followed the latter looked
mystified but the owner was smiling

  a few minutes ago i said we were going to jupiter
and what i say goes i foresaw something of this kind
arising so arranged a servo control operated from my
stateroom you can turn the wheel till-your blue in the
face but you are powerless to alter our direction

  the big fellow with the bald head gave a snarl like a
hunted pig and rushed at jackthorpe only to find him-
self looking down the barrel of captain drakes ray pis-
tol

  jack brushed the gun aside

  now look here fellows he said
sharply weve had enough amuse-
ment from now on were starting
work you know the terms of your
contract in addition to your ordin-
ary wage you are to receive a thou-
sand dollars each for each one of the
trinkets we discover and you must ex-
pect to face a little danger in any
case we are going on youve no alter-
native carry on with your jobs and
well land ok play the fool shut me
up kill me or throwr me overboard
and youre sunk not even captain
drake can alter that servo apparatus
once ive set it and if it remains as
it is now the gravity of the planet will
seize hold of the ship and youll be
smashed to pulp theres your choice
-certain death or    sticking to or-
ders

  sullen for a second the men broke almost immediately
into a cheer all that is except big martin he slunk
to the back of the group muttering to himself

  already even on the outer fringes of the atmospheric
envelope the asteroid was encountering a windstorm
which would have been described as a gale had it oc-
cured on earth and every mile the ship plunged forward
the density and velocity of the heavy fog-like gases seemed
to increase and the variability of the currents to be mag-
nified the gravity pull was now considerable yet the
wind force was becoming so terrible that the giant ship
was being carried hither and thither like a paper bag in a
breeze

  now it would he sucked down in the eddying core of a
gigantic twister tornado now it would be borne up-
wards before a great windspout to resist this play of
the elements to any marked degree would have been fatal
by driving flat out captain drake could have forced a
passage through the vaporous fury but the immense fric-
tion set up would have consumed the ship by fire in a
few seconds even if the resistance had not torn its girders
asunder

  right into the heart of a group of deathly black clouds
plunged the vessel a blackness only equalled in inter-
stellar space itself drake shot off a couple of rockets
to the left and the ship shaking itself like a collie dog
seemed for a moment to right itself then it started to
circle round and round at first slowly and in wide cir-
cles then faster and faster like a top like a pinwheel in
a mad merry-go-round

  impossible to see what was taking place it was easy to

guess the ship had been caught in the maelstrom clouds
at the root of a tornado in another second it was
caught by the palpitating tuber emerging from the massed
clouds and whirling madly borne downwards at a thou-
sand miles an hour then with a sickening lurch the
writhing mass seemed literally to kick the ship away
from it through the calmer atmosphere below

  stunned and bruised captain and crew lay collecting
their scattered senses suddenly a light appeared around
the ship

  good grief said one who was by way of being a
humorist weve got a halo already

  at this the captain looked up dazedly from whatever
window one looked for a distance of a few yards from
the hull the atmosphere was bright as a sunny day with
a startled cry drake rushed to his feet and threw the
reverse rocket switch

  were on fire he shouted the twister gave us
such a huge parting kick through the heavy atmosphere
that the friction has made our sides glow like an incan-
descent mantle

	with speed gradually decelerated the light slowly died

  down it was calmer now but if possible darker
than ever a great sheet of lightning suddenly illumed
the whole firmament followed almost instantly by ter-
rific thundering again and again this was repeated as
the ship glided slowly through the pitchy black clouds
drake was trying to steer a wide spiral course so that he
might eventually make a safe landing despite the im-
mense gravity

  all at once the place was lit up with a reddish glare
the men blanched fearing another fire but jack and
captain drake reassured them the worst was over they
had passed through the awful atmospheric storm belt into
the quieter denser stratum below and the red light came
from the planet jupiter himself

  it was raining yet little of the rain was reaching the
ground the heat from the giant planet causing the mois-
ture to evaporate before it reached the crust dense mists
of water vapor hugging close the surface of jupiter still
hid the actual landscape from view volplaning down
with reverse rockets going to counteract gravity captain
drake gradually brought the asteroid through these
white mists

  somewhat attuned as they had now become to the red
glare they were dazzled indeed by its brilliance now that
the final envelope of vapor had been pierced the scene
too was one of bizarre beauty the earth was not red
although the light diffused through it from the incandes-
cent gases in the interior imparted the red glow but was
of many shades of slate and brown much like our own
soil for the most part it was covered with dense vegeta-
tion of yellow and purple which viewed through the bino-
culars resembled the plants that grow on the bottom of
the ocean much more than earthly trees the surface un-
dulated in great circular corrugations that held out little
hope of a suitable landing place

  presently cruising around they spotted a clearing on
the hillsides of one of the corrugations a veritable honey-
comb of holes could be seen while in the arena within
ten thousand or more squat figures stood symmetrically
arranged like an army on parade

  the short broad jovians stood stock still as though

riveted to the spot nor did they appear to have noticed
the great ship cruising above them lower and lower
drifted the asteroid until the features of the figures could
be clearly made out they had gorilla-like bodies but
their faces were unmistakably human although clearly a
humanity low in the scale of evolution the most notice-
able features of these strange people however were their
utter immobility and the fact that they glinted like bur-
nished gold

  to jacks order captain drake brought the vessel to a
standstill in a corner of the great clearing the jovians
took not the slightest notice remaining as rigid as statues
jack tossed the captain a metallic suit and a curious pair
of boots the latter attached to a small control board
what devices are these asked drake

  pillings patent air-pressure control suit and rocket
boots for making headway on planets where the air pres-
sure is high and the gravity great said jack scrambling
into a similar rig-out as he did so he caught sight of
martin scowling in the shadows good idea he would
have him with them and a third suit caught the big fellow
a plonk on his bald pate

  he glanced defiance but shovelled his great carcass in-
to the curious habit

  once out of the vessel the trio found they could hardly
move a step through the dense atmosphere their feet
seemed to be glued to the ground the jovian air was
as jack knew quite breathable if supplied at earthly pres-
sure the pilling suits they were wearing could be set
to maintain such pressure only a valve allowing fresh air
to be admitted to the suit and headgear a pump forcing
the exhaled air out of the suit again despite the great
pressure without an earthly atmosphere could be main-
tained within the metal suit

  now turn down the left switch ordered jack im-
mediately a series of small retorts weft heard and the
boots were propelled forward alternately left and right
at a sharp walking pace progressing thus they soon
reached the first phalanx of the jovians they could see
now that these beings were almost as tall as men yet
much broader but they gave not the slightest sign that
they had seen or heard the earthmcn approach nearer
and nearer the latter crept yet neither a wink nor a nod
did one of the ten thousand jovians bestow on them

	at length jack was near enough to touch the nearest
man he raised his arm slowly painfully it felt as
though a ton weight were pulling it back at last how-
ever he managed to get it laid on the mans shoulder
still he took no notice his body felt hard and metallic
jack peered into the mans face it was life-like but life-
less the whole being was a mass of red gold then he
burst out laughing

  what fools we are were in a field of statues
  but said captain drake it looks like gold

  it  is   gold cried martin excitedly fondling
the statue- and he would have tried to lift the thing
bodily from the ground had jack not caught him by the
arm and pointed to the hills surrounding the clearing
there issuing from the honeycomb holes were thousands
of similar figures similar except for the fact that in-
stead of being gold colored they had a hairy skin that
outrivailed a peacocks tail in its many and gorgeous hues
and for the much more material fact thatthey were mov-
the platinum planets



ing and brandishing business-like clubs in a masterly
fashion to earthly eyes they moved strangely as though
they were being viewed through a slow motion camera
yet they were closing in on the vessel from all sides mur-
muring angrily

   lets beat it quick shouted jack and with a last avar-
icious look at the golden field martin tore himself away
with the rocket boots at full speed ahead they had
ample time to reach the ship before the soaring jovians
could with their slow fantastic leaps close on them
within half a furlong of the asteroid however captain
drake found himself unable to move slowly but impla-
cably he found himself sinking into the soil he tried
to raise himself but only sank the deeper and before
he could attract the attention of the others he had gone
in to the ankles as he continued slowly to gravitate
he felt the pitchy mud warmer they struggled and
hauled at the unfortunate captain but he sank down and
down until he was engulfed up to the waist and jack
noticed with consternation that the ground was also be-
ginning very slowly to give way beneath his own feet

  despite the ludicrous sloth of their movements the
jovians were circling round in narrowing curves like vul-
tures descending on carrion there was but one thing
o be done jack jerked off the helmet of the captains
suit and pried open the breastplate then he and the
big sailor literally tore drake out of the protective cloth-
ing set their rocket boots flat out and carried him to the
companion way of the asteroid

  as they did so they heard the clatter of stones behind
them as the angry jovians hurled what appeared to be
their only weapons the large stone clubs but like
the beings themselves the missiles traveled slowly through
the dense atmosphere and speedily fell to the ground ow-
ing to the mighty gravity

  they were safe but the force of the struggle through
the heavy air had bowled the captain over with re-
storatives he regained consciousness only to be thrown im-
mediately into great agony the aftermath of being sub-
jected to the great atmospheric pressure

chapter iii

the planets found

	the jovians jabbered excitedly crowding round the
vessel and hurling defiance and clubs at the earthmen
they could see through the windows

  get out the thought receiver commanded jack and
let us discover just what is their grievance the ma-
chine was set up and jackthorpe projected its narrow
beam focusing it on one of the most prominent of the
jovians then he glanced into the eyepiece he did not
look for long

  good lord he ejaculated no wonder the beggars
are angry that field of statues is one of their cemeter-
ies these gold figures are their dead ancestors whose
bodies they plate with gold to preserve them they are
demanding that martin and myself be thrown to them for
sacrifice when we touched the beastly things we com-
mitted sacrilege to the nth degree

  guess wed better get while the goings good suggest-
ed one of the men with a scared face as he looked down
on the sea of babbling apes

  rot jerked out jack gruffly set up the projector
the thought-transmitter or projector was soon in place
and traversing slowly with its wide beam jade concen-
trated deeply and thought vividly as he adjusted its
headpiece

  through its medium he assured the jovians that the
earthmen had sinned through ignorance and offered his
apologies he made it plain at the same time that they
were all-powerful beings who could by a turn of the
hand destroy the whole jovian community in a few sec-
onds a great change overcame the multitude it ceased
its babbling and a low fearful muttering was substituted
as the broad beam of the transmitter was projected here
and there among the crowd

   captain drake had recovered sufficiently to take an in-
terest in the proceedings and was gazing intently into
the eyepiece of the thought-receiver

  they want to know now if we dont intend to tamper
with their dead or harm themselves why the hell were
here at all he announced as the images came to him
from their leaders brain through the uncanny mechan-
ism 

  jack summoned up all his concentrative ability and
told them through the medium of the transmitter that
they had come merely to possess a few trinkets which they
believed were to be found on jupiter a wave of in-
credulity passed over the mob at this jack made a
further effort and pictured as much as he could remember
of the platinum planets based on art prints of them
he had seen

  immediately the chorus of angry cries revived itself a
hundredfold jack pushed the captain unceremoniously
away from the receiver and pressed his eyes against the
lens he gave a low whistle for the brain picture em-
anating from the jovian leader bewildered him

  there lit by the red glare of a giant volcano in the
background lay ignace pascals space flier of centuries
before an avenue of the golden dead guarded the en-
trance to the massive ship but as jack peered through
the eyepiece he could see that these were not the ape-
like jovian men such as beleagured the asteroid but tall-
er thinner men earthmen americans or europeans

  there was old pascal himself he could recognize him
from the old films of the expedition preserved in the
national museum and captain keller too and me-
beth the engineer they were all there the devils
had killed them and plated them with gold then mounted
them over their space ship to keep guard but to keep
guard over what

  the image from the jovians brain dissolved and jack
could now see the interior of the space ship he held
his breath for there arranged on a high altar were all of
the platinum planets with the exception of slaughter
this as jack knew ignace pascal had left where it right-
ly belonged on the earth priests and acolytes bowed
before them while wretched captives lay bound for sac-
rifice in a corner of the space ship

  the seething mass of ill-shaped humanity yelled itself
hoarse in grisly anger but jack and his good captain
remained calm and confident in their own security

  jack turned to the transmitter and demanded to know
where the platinum planets lay an intense wail greet-
ed this request but the jovians could not keep their minds
off the question by focussing the narrow beam on first


wonder stories for august 

one man and then another jack through the eyepiece of
the receiver got a pretty fair idea of the direction in which
the volcano lay almost half the circumference of the
giant planet it lay away from this spot yet many of these
men had made the pilgrimage evidently the platinum
planets were regarded as the holy of holies a jovian
mecca

  well weve got all the information well obtain here
announced jack we had better be buzzing

	nothing loath the crew took up their stations and cap-
tain drake released the immense rocket shots which was
required to overcome the gravity of ole man jove they
had been anticipating some reaction on the natives but
they were not prepared for the tragedy which followed
as the flaming gases rushed out the ship shot upwards
and a great hole was blown in the earth from which it had
risen but the hole immediately seemed to fill in again
and hundreds of jovians sank slowly into the ground on
which they had stood so firmly the moment before

 as they watched the horrified earthmen saw the jov-
ian earth eddying outwards in a series of ever-increasing
circles as the water in a pond does when a stone is cast
into it

  the horde of jovians bolted to their hillside burrows
as fast as their slow-moving limbs could carry them but
it was not fast enough for the majority of them the surg-
ing earth broke under them and they sank with horrible
cries into the pitchy semi-fluid mass which slowly re-
lentlessly engulfed them

  god cried captain drake turning from the sickening
spectacle what does it mean

  it means replied jack that we have had a remark-
ably lucky escape as i have suspected since your own
alarming experience apart from a few inches or feet of
solid crust jupiter is still in a fluid or semi-fluid condi-
tion that could hardly be otherwise considering that
all its available light and heat or nearly all comes from
the interior of the planet

  the jovians are always as it were skating on thin ice
any disturbance such as our rocket explosion will set
the fluid eddying outwards in waves breaking the thin
crust as it goes then too i expect the landscape abounds
in thin places you no doubt put your foot in one of
those

  the horror of the catastrophe which had the earthmen
known to be possible could have been prevented by fright-
ening the jovians to their holes through the thought pic-
tures threw a blanket of depression over the whole ship
the crew began to get homesick again and started to im-
plore jack to return

  to the latters surprise big martin turned about on his
former attitude trounced his companions soundly for
chicken-hearted cowards and declared his intention of fol-
lowing his leader through hell if necessary

  martins volte-face worked wonders the men set about
their tasks with a good will and jack was gratified to think
that personal contact had wrought such a change in the
man but captain drake shook his head a leopard
does not change his spots he quoted sententiously

  despite the fact that a jovian night and day judged by
rotation occupy together only nine hours and fifty-five
minutes the travelers found no conscious division of
night from day the feeble light from the far-off sun was

almost completely cut off by the dense dark clouds of the
circling envelope the inherent light from the planet itself
naturally shining continuously

 hence they were just as dependent upon their instru-
ments to record time as though they had been flying
through interstellar space it was seldom indeed that
even one of the nine satellites could be glimpsed for
more than a moment through the black pall of storm
clouds

  on they went over the corrugated plain that seemed
monotonous in its endlessness everywhere the same sea-
weed-like vegetation seemed to flourish and everywhere the
sides of the hills were punctured with a myriad holes ev-
erywhere too the fields of gold-foiled corpses as tubby
cantor called them abounded their ship cast no shadow
on the ground although a blurred image of it appeared in
the mists above their heads progress was naturally slow
because the frictional fire risk of rapid travel was great
the heavy atmosphere threw a great strain on the skeleton
and most important of all the discharge of anything more
than the smallest rockets would undoubtedly draw the at-
tention of the jovians dwelling below jack was intent on
purloining the platinum planets and the element of sur-
prise formed the crux of the whole plan

	to match the even temperature and dull uniformity of

  the landscape for there appeared to be no seas or
lakes rain falling when the lower mists became saturated
only to evaporate almost as it touched the baked crust
the jovians seemed to be all of one vari-plumaged na-
tionality and as far as the travelers were able to judge
none seemed to have spotted the asteroid flying as noise-
lessly as possible high above them

  after seventy hours of continuous flying the red and
yellow flares of the great volcano landmarking their ob-
jective could be seen that meant that they were within
a few miles of it as visibility in the heavy atmosphere
was of course very bad captain drake sailed upwards
until the ship was in the fringe of the mists then at an
even slower pace he proceeded cautiously

  the volcano outlined in sharp relief against the gray
black of the jovian storm clouds was a fearsome thing
in its ruddy glare the priests moving to and from the old
space ship looked like imps in an all-to-real inferno
the avenue of golden dead made up of pascal and his
officers and crew stood there just as jack had seen them
through the thought receiver and even as they looked
they saw a poor struggling wretch dragged through the
avenue into the doors of the space flier another sacrifice
to the platinum planets big martins eyes bulged out
of his head

  but it was not the pathetic scene before him that moved
him it was not the thought the object of their expedition
so near at hand it was the thought of so much gold wait-
ing there ready to be lifted

  as usual jack did not wait to act he had formed his
plans as they approached and as the ship cruised at mini-
mum speed above the space flier he quickly adjusted his
rocket boots and prepared to fit the pilling suit to his
body

  no hoys this is my game he said as he waved off
several eager volunteers im going alone they wont
spot one where a number would attract attention and
remember no violence weve done enough damage al-
the platinum planets



ready if i dont turn up within a reasonable time youre
to sail without me ill have no more lives lost and no
reprisals

  the great helicoptic wings of the flier were spread and
the immense ship descended swiftly and vertically at the
same time captain drake moved the beam of the thought
transmitter from acolyte to priest and priest to acolyte
commanding them through its medium to hasten on dis-
tant errands it was astonishing to see how they obeyed
the suggestion they would look up as though they had
suddenly thought of something and then make a dart
away from the golden avenue soon by the power of
suggestion drake had cleared the square

  the ship was now about tree height from the ground
jack threw out a rope ladder and taking a big sack over
his shoulder was thrust out of the valve so busy had
they all been that they had not noticed big martin almost
duplicating these actions on the other side with the help
of his more immediate pals jack had hardly touched the
ground when the big sailor slung himself down the
rope ladder from the opposite port and hid in a clump
of seaweed trees

  setting the rocket-boots in motion jack proceeded up
the avenue urgent though his mission was he could
not resist stopping for a moment to look at the lane of
golden explorers standing in such life-like attitudes a
staircase that looked as though it had been transplanted
from a dickens house led up to the entrance to the ves-
sel here the boots were more of a hindrance than a
help and it was only with the greatest difficulty that jack
succeeded in climbing the obstacle

chapter iv
a tragedy

	at length however with wind knocked out of him he

  scrambled into the curious temple the stateroom had
been lined with beaten gold and a strange blue-shot metal
which jack could not identify but which shone iridescent
as an opal the high altar which he had seen in the
brain-picture was of this metal and on it stood the plat-
inum planets clean and polished as though they had just
left the hand of their creator a priest was making obei-
sance to then and in a corner lay a sorely bruised and
bound jovian youth

  to overcome the priest with fumes from a subtle am-
monia-compound generator was the work of a second the
man lay as though dead but jack knew well that he would
recover in a few minutes as he tried to lift the first
statuette however he found that it was fixed immovable
it seemed to form a part of the very altar itself he tried
another and another and another they were all alike
there was more than jovian gravity to account for this
the blue winking stone must exercise a curious magne-
tism

  time was pressing drake could not keep the whole
ecclesiastical establishment running messages all day
while who knew how many acolytes lurked in the other
chambers of the space flier standing with his back to
the altar jack placed his hands behind him and clasped
the first effigy with a jerk of his body he managed to
throw the switch operating the rocket boots and holding
on to the trinket like grim death he set up a tug of war

between the rockets and the magnetic altar the boots
won and he quickly threw the statue in the sack then
he started on the second then the third and the fourth

  the noise of the rockets in the heavy air seemed deaf-
ening and as each prize was secured jack felt an in-
creasing horror of discovery but he was not going to
take less than he had come for-the whole set at last
the eight figures were in the bag no one had yet ap-
peared but he could hear ominous heavy footfalls com-
ing slowly towards the room from another part of the
ship he gathered up his sack and not without difficulty
got it across his shoulder

  as he did so he glanced involuntarily at the pitiful
object trussed up in the corner there was such a pathe-
tic look in the lads eyes so like the harrowing appeal of
an injured antelope that heavy laden as he was he bent
down and severed the kelp-like bonds his act of mercy
nearly cost his life the jovian youth clung to him like
a drowning man clutching a straw and at that very mo-
ment two jovian priests whom the racket of the rockets
had aroused loped gracefully and wrathfully into the
room

  at the sight of the double sacrilege they howled in
agonized choler and while the one beat upon a huge gong
of gold the other pursued the burdened thief who was hav-
ing hard work to negotiate the tortuous staircase as he
half dragged and half carried the benumbed youth and
the bag of images

  slow though the priest moved his grisly paw was al-
most on jacks shoulder as the pursued man reached the
bottom of the stairs jack could hear the jovians breath
coming in short gasps he was an old man and unac-
customed to such athletic fare as this chase provided jack
could hear too the strident tones of the great gong and
he could see from all sides the acolytes hastening in
prodigiously slow leaps to its call

  once in the open he had little to fear he jerked on
the full power and despite the weight of the treasure and
the cumbersomness of his living burden the boots an-
swered well and as he was being hauled up the rope
ladder he caught a glimpse of his one-time pursuer sit-
ting on the bottom stair puffing and blowing like an asth-
matic porpoise

  shove this chap into the pressure chamber he or-
dered indicating the bewildered jovian youth as he tore
off his helmet hell probably peg out in our rarefied
atmosphere if we dont acclimate him gradually then
all hands to their posts well get under way before these
beggars get near enough to be injured by our rocket dis-
charges

  but  sir    commenced one of the men ner-
vously what about big martin

  well what about him

  hes   well sir partly    like    gone out sir

  partly gone what the hades do you mean and
jack strode over to the port window

	while jack had been so busily engaged in securing the

  treasure big martin had been on a treasure hunt of
his own as soon as jack had entered the pascal ship the
big sailor stole from the seaweed clump in which he had
hidden and keeping close to the fringe of vegetation he
circled round until he reached the nearest of the golden
figures


wonder stories for august 

  locking his ape-like arms round the effigy of pascal
and setting his rocket boots flat out he gave a mighty
heave succeeding in dragging the figure along with him
his accomplices hoisted pascal aboard but martins
greed was only partially sated breathless as he was he
darted back to the avenue and tried to annex the second
figure this was a great hulk of a fellow bulging amid-
ships the exhausted martin only managed to topple the
figure over excitedly he tore off a great piece of the
gold shell threw the switch and the boots moved forward
a yard only a yard and-the rockets failed

  feverishly the big fellow wriggled and twisted in an
effort to get the mechanism going without losing hold of
his booty it was no use the device was dead as he
glanced down at his feet he saw with horror that he had
stopped right in the middle of a thin spot he had sunk
several inches already

  even then he might have saved himself had not his
consuming avarice asserted itself he clung to the great
chunk of gold when had he thrown it from him his great
strength no doubt would have enabled him to extricate
himself as it was borne down by its great weight his
efforts to pull his feet out of the gluey mess were useless
he continued to sink slowly but surely into the morass

  so busy had he been securing his treasure that he had
not heard the boom of the great gong nor the cries and
wails of the angry jovians now stuck fast and helpless-
ly looking round for some avenue of escape he saw the
dozens of ungainly and angry priests moving with leaden
feet towards him their stone clubs poised above their
savage heads with a great yell he threw the piece of
gold away from him kicked and struggled it was too
late his struggles served merely to immerse him the
further in the trap

  things had developed thus far when jack darted to the
window like their leader the crew was shocked by what
they saw and more than one brave fellow was for going
down to rescue martin jack restrained them the dis-
tance was too great long before they could have reached
the spot much less pull out the unfortunate sailor the
jovians would have reached him and despatched him
there was only one thing to do jack did it

  he swung round the thought projector playing its beam
on the leaders concentrating deeply he ordered them
to stand still for a moment they obeyed but it was
only for a moment steeped in superstition for seons
everything that they held sacred had been violated by the
earthmen the one who had filched from them the plat-
inum planets had got away scot-free but the gods had
delivered into their hands to pay for both crimes this
other who had desecrated their golden guardians

  their minds were full of vengeance and while sugges-
tion might have acted under normal circumstances their
hate-filled brains rejected it after the first slight wav-
ering they came on steadily as before

  jack concentrated harder and harder but it was of no
use captain drake tried what he could do but it was
of no avail on they came

  by now martin had sunk up to the waist from the
ship the watchers could see his frantic struggles could
hear his anguished cries and could even see the horror
imprinted on his face for he had tom off his helmet
the jovians with their fantastically slow steps moved
nearer and nearer towards him

  there was nothing to do they had a weapon or two
but they were of very short range captain drake took
a shot with his ray pistol and set fire to a clump of the
seaweed trees but so intent were the jovians on their
quarry that they never noticed the effort which had fallen
at least a hundred yards short

  god we cant see him murdered in cold blood cried
jack as the circle of jovians surrounded the terror-strick-
en martin let go a rocket shot and make it a big one

	the ship shot upwards as the flaming gases were re-
leased a great hole was ploughed below them reveal-
ing the pitchy bubbling substratum and the gradually in-
creasing wave circles commenced but the jovians never
turned they were full of the lust of the chase a great
club swung through the air and caught martin heavily on
the chest he sank up to the armpits another club bur-
ied itself beside him another and another he was up to
the neck now but his eyes were bulging with horror then
a better-thrown missile pulped in his shining bald head
and the gluey mass at last bubbled over him

  the watchers sighed at once horrified and relieved
they looked again the earth was pulsating like a living
thing the jovians who a moment before had been
howling exultantly were now wailing piteously the
ground was cracking up under their feet and already some
of them were being drawn into the sure death of the jovian
fluid

  crimping and crackling the circular waves moved out-
wards the golden figures tottered and fell the crazy
staircase crumpled and the ancient space flier began to
rock then the surging nauseating mass oozed out of the
cracked earth and lapped over the golden guardians the
jovians sank struggling below the surface and finally the
last vane of ignace pascals monster ship disappeared into
jupiters maw

  jack seized captain drakes arm

  lets get back home he said brokenly make all the
haste you can

  there followed a voyage of disaster awed by the
grisly fate of martin captain drake and his officers al-
lowed their eagerness to get away from the red planet to
stampede their judgment they attempted to drive the
asteroid through the whirling storm-belt at a ridiculous
pace

  the men were panicky even jackthorpe himself nor-
mally so calm seemed to be swept away in the general
agitation and fell in readily with the mens foolhardy
efforts to make haste at all costs every rivet and brace
rattled as the huge ship was propelled outwards more
than once the tell-tale halo appeared to show that the
outer envelope had become incandescent times beyond
count the space ship was taken from their control by the
elements and twisted and twirled like a childs top but
every man aboard from the owner to the cabin boy had
but one idea fixed in his mind-home-and each was
prepared to take unprecedented risks to get there

  despite their haste the wind-belt seemed much wider
than it had on their coming according to their instru-
ments they should have passed through the worst of it an
hour ago and still there was no sign of the tornadoes
abating the electroscopic plant determining their posi-
tion from a proof plane actuated by the electromagnetic
forces of outer space showed them to be almost at satel-
the platinum planets



lite  yet here they were still in the storm belt honrs
passed and still the fight went on the tempest howled
and the ship shook as if with ague panic unfettered
seized the men some cursed some prayed then
came a whisper the whisper grew to an angry and ex-
cited babble the babble to a chorus of loud bellows as
the mob now beside itself poured into jacks cabin

  what do you want here get back to your posts

  its those things cried one big fellow everyone
knows theyre hoodoo theyve put a spell on the ship
and he jerked a dirty thumb towards the planets
reposing on a side table

chapter v
tha return to earth

 an angjy approving murmur passed round the men

  hand them over and let us chuck them overboard
cried a rough voice well never be saved else

  jack shook his head and would have spoken but he
might as well have tried to keep back the tide the men
surged forward and unceremoniously seized the trinkets
carrying them aft jackthorpe thought of the thought
machines but they were too far off the men risking
a flooding of the dense jovian atmosphere were already
wrestling with the valve-ports

  jack seeking some way out cast a glance at the instru-
ments separated from his cabin only by a vitreous par-
tition he gave a shout that brought the crazed men
running towards him the space compass had whirled
round the positionmeter vibrated violently then its
needle rested unshakably on a spot that showed clearly
they were still in the very midst of the tempestuous en-
velope

  it is the planets he cried

  yes shouted the sailors overboard with them

  jack laughed keep them where they are and well
have no further trouble science not superstition ac-
counts for the trouble when i pinched them they lay
on a magnetic altar and have become highly charged
what a fool i was to leave them so near our delicate
instruments they have played the devil with the elec-
troscopic planet and weve been like the old sailor who
glued the compass wrong way round and landed at ice-
land instead of spain

  some of the men laughed at the sally but there were
dark looks and sullen faces the education of the work-
ing classes was plain rather than ornamental and static
electricity was a closed book to many of them super-
natural causes seemed a much more likely explanation
when a new course had been determined and when after
quite a brief spell the quiet of outer space was reached
even the most panicky was reassured from abysmal
pessimism the crew traveled to giddy optimism like
lightning

  but jack had had a warning he placed the plat-
inum planets in the hold strongroom and locked it with
a new combination the men were holding a sing-song
with characteristic cacophony and a new-found zest when
captain drake entered jacks cabin gravely

  whos funeral demanded jack flippantly

ours he answered laconically without smiling then
he added weve sprung a leak where lord knows

our engineers have searched the ship from stem to stem
but we cant find a crack yet were having the deuce of
a job to keep up the atmospheric pressure and a reason-
able temperature our hot air is escaping into the vacuum
without in some way  but i cant find a sign of a hole
loose rivets perhaps suggested jack the ship
got a terrible buffeting in the storm-belt

  drake shook his head been over every darned rivet
in the ship everything is as sound as a bell but fifty
cubic feet of air at normal temperature and pressure are
escaping every hour unless we can stop the leak we can
never reach earth

  no said jack keenly as the full gravity of the situa-
tion came to him and every hour is making things worse
we are losing heat as well and as the air becomes colder
an equal weight of it occupies less volume so we shall
lose more and more each hour until we suffocate if we
dont freeze first keep up the temperature as much as
possible and redouble the search

  loath as they were to alarm the crew every hand was
pressed into the search every bolt and rivet the seat-
ings of the port valves the double-lining plates of the
structure were examined and re-examined but all to no
purpose the leakages continued steadily so long as
the temperature was kept constant the rate of leakage
remained constant but a drop of a few degrees resulted
in a greater weight of air being lost

  the facts had not been made known to the crew who
had been led to understand that the inspection was a pre-
cautionary one rendered advisable by the storm buffeting
but somehow the true story leaked out almost as myster-
iously as the uncanny leak itself and once more bewil-
dered the men fell back on their old superstitious fears
reduce the pressure five inches commanded jack
but 

  its our only hope that and keeping the temperature
as high as we can perhaps we can circle into mars or-
bit

  drake shook his head impossible shes approach-
ing us our only chance is to hold out until we can reach
the earth in the normal way

  the effect of the lowered pressure was to cause the al-
ready despondent crew to be plunged still further into a
depression the walls of the ship ran damp the sailors
fingered weapons and muttered darkly they searched
here and there for the planets and not finding them
attempted to blast open the strong room crazed with
fear and hopelessness they once more besieged jacks
cabin with murderous intent

  jack and captain drake kept going in the low pressure
by powerful stimulants were examining the outer shell
of the ship with ultra-powerful lenses under the very
highest powers the selalumagnum plate surface of the
shell which should have been bright and polished showed
dull rugged and pitted a dense network of exceedingly
fine lines appeared

  whats the breadth of these lines asked jackthorpe
drake consulted his micrometer abouft one twenty-
millionth of a centimetre

  as i thought said jack smiling grimly our
trouble is diffusion when our ship heated up by fric-
tion in the jovian atmosphere the selalumagnum shell un-
derwent chemical change and instead of the tough im-
permeable envelope which once encased us we are now


wonder stories for august 

only held back from the outer vacuum bv a spongy porous
shell

  but these cracks are miscroscopic nothing can pass
through them protested drake

  in the ordinary sense no but gases may diffuse through
them into the vacuum without these tiny cracks are large
compared with nitrogen or oxygen molecules with dia-
meters a hundredth of a millionth of a centimeter in
the jovian air we did not notice it because as our mole-
cules passed out others from the outer air passed in but
now there is no interchange and our precious air is
pouring through these countless cracks these one-way
streets

  what can we do asked drake practically

  got any paint or varnish very well get the men
on painting the interior

  what the whole ship exclaimed drake aghast

  every foot we cover means a reduction of the leak
get to it

  it was easy to say get to it but the men were surging
round the cabin somewhat lazily yet brandishing all man-
ner of strange weapons and angrily demanding once more
that the platinum planets be dumped after sgveral
attempts to reason with them jack slung the thought-
projector into position and ordered drake to release ex-
tra air pressure the added pressure acted magically in
placfe of the languid despondency they assumed an alert-
ness but it was a hostile alertness and they proceeded
to hack at the vitreous partition separating jackthorpe and
the captain from them as jack worked the projector
they halted looked extremely foolish for a second or two
then dropped their weapons and stood attenfive while
jack explained the situation they then scurried to the
mighty task of varnishing the interior of the ship

  it was soon evident to jack that helpful though the
operation might be they would be extremely fortunate to
be able to patch up and reach earth when the pressure
was high the men worked fast but he could not afford
to waste so much air and when the pressure was re-
duced they became languid worse still although he
could dissipate their superstitious fears while operating
the projector these fears returned more intensely than
ever when the men got beyond its beams and as the
work continued to become more hopeless it was soon evi-
dent that the supply of covering material was bound to
run short before half the ship was finished the influ-
ence of the projector waned more and more

	the ship was still a weeks journey from earth when
drake announced to jack that the last battery of liquid
air flasks had been started it had been difficult for the
past twenty-four hours to get the men to work at all so
hopeless had their task seemed and so low had the air
pressure become they had gathered aft in little groups
surly and rebellious cursing the hoodoo trinkets the
air from the decompressor had been released to help and
the rescued jovian youth lay gasping and gurgling for
breath in the rarified atmosphere of the space ship

   the vessel was growing cold as much of the liquid
fuel as could be spared from the rockets had been used to
warm the ship now there seemed nothing to do but to
wait for death cold and airless death through the
ports the earth shone beckoning like a star set brilliant-

ly on the dull black expanse as if to mock the doomed
men

  the air was going fast now although jack had taken
chargc of the battery and was throttling down the cy-
linders as much as he dared for the temperature was fall-
ing a degree a minute the men for the most part slumped
to the deck gasping and choking drake lolled opposite
his face a livid purple and his hands blue with cold
the blood was spurting and congealing as it spurted
from the young jovians ears and nose and jacks right
hand remained frozen hard to the cylinder valve the
man nearest him spat languidly the liquid freezing im-
mediately

  as in a dream jack noted the mans action then
with a start its significance dawned on him with a
mighty effort he wrenched his hand from the cylinder
valve there was one chance the rocket tubes were
water-cooled if he could spray the interior of the ves-
sel with the water from them and their supply tank an
impervious layer of ice would form immediately and
further diffusion would be arrested

   breaking vials of sal-volatile he secured the attention
of drake and a few of the crew and they pumped a stream
of the warm water around the sides of the ship a sheet
of ice forming as jack had anticipated with a cry of
exultation jack turned on the cylinder valves full-cock
and they breathed in the life-giving air greedily

  how the government survey ship moonmaiden ii al-
most a week later sighted the asteroid with burnt-out
rocket tubes clean out of control the entire crcw in a
frozen coma dashing headlong towards earth and how
by masterly spacemanship the moonmaiden captain se-
cured the derelict and brought her safely to earth is a
tale that every schoolboy knows by heart the adven-
turers were gradually nursed back to health and they
separated a little older wiser and richer for the exper-
ience

chapter vi
into space again

	the horrors which had attended the securing of the

  platinum planets successfully precluded even such
a hard-boiled adventurer as jackthorpe from going
straightway in search of the ninths statuette the symbol
of earth called slaughter for a year or two he set-
tled down to supervise bunchs schooling presented prizes
at baby shows and talked a lot of bosh to a parcel of
fools at election time in quite the approved manner

   not that he had altogether given up the idea of secur-
ing the ninth planet to complete the group he preferred
to toy with the idea to the accompaniment of a choice
havana rather than to get down to brass tacks and hard-
ships the young jovian thrived on earth and soon
picked up a useful line of modern slang following jack
about with the devotion of a dog

  soon however the old wanderlust returned and he
combed the earth from end to end in search of slaugh-
ter pascal would certainly have left the earth piece
on the earth but where from grant land to gra-
ham land from cape agulhas to spitzbergen from the
bass strait to kamchatka jack traversed and re-tra-
versed the earth his agents hunted up historical rec-
the platinum planets



ords in every library in the world he even took a trip to
the moon on the offchance that pascal had considered the
satellite a suitable site for the earth piece but all to no
avail there was not even the smell of a clue the more
impossible the task appeared the more was jackthorpes
desire whetted the thing became an obsession he
dreamed of the ninth piece he could not eat for thinking
of it he lived for it and as year succeeded year and
yet no trace of the statuette was forthcoming he lost in-
terest in everything else he became a veritable hermit
tinkering all day and half the night in his library and
laboratory always seeking a solution scientific or histori-
cal

  jumping cobras exclaimed bunch one night as
lightheartedly he bounced into the library you look
like a ghost old bean why not give up the whole lot
of rot

   jack turned his sleepless eyes towards his younger broth-
er who had grown to comely manhood and was promis-
ing to be as brilliant in surgery as jack had proved in
adventure you dont understand id give anything to
possess it i must i must

   youll possess a nice straitjacket if you go on much
longer like this announced bunch half banteringly half
seriously but if you want to know where pascal hid
the treasure why not ask him and he jerked his thumb
in the direction of the golden figure of the old explorer-
crank which stood like a living being in the alcove sur-
rounded by the platinum planets

   you are the padded cell candidate not me said jack
testily

  no protested bunch im serious even our pre-
historic surgeons knew that tissue from a dead animal
could be kept alive indefinitely provided suitable nourish-
ment was supplied later of course we found that pro-
vided decomposition was entirely arrested such tissue
could be kept in a state of suspended animation over long
periods without nourishment and could be enlivened
whenever desired by proper nourishment the next step
concerns pascal we have every evidence that the jovian
method of body-planting or some incidental embalming
process effectually prevents decomposition

   very entertaining commented the elder brother wear-
ily but of what use is all this to us

  throttle down old bean throttle down our profes-
sor michelson  has invented a modification of the
standard thought projectors and receivers and -has al-
ready had many successes in operating on the brains of
dead men

  you mean shouted jack excitedly that he could
probe in old pascals brain which has been dead for cen-
turies

  bunch nodded

   then lets get him quickly

   it was a weird scene that was enacted in dr michelsons
laboratory the golden corpse of the long dead explorer
lay on his operating table a giant thought-projector
with solar-vacuum tubes stood at one side and a similar
receiver at the other for days the professor had supplied
suitable nourishment to the brain-tissue

   michelson made an incision in the golden plate encas-
ing pascals brain and attached the terminals of his sensi-
tive apparatus at a point below the plane of the sensorium
cerebelli he completed the circuit and switched on the

current a faintly pink light glowed in the tubes grad-
ually turning to a sickly green michelson rubbed his
hands

  we haf success i tink no yes

	what he meant the others had not the slightest idea

   but their hearts beat faster

  tink ze tinks you wish commanded the doctor hand-
ing jack the headphones of the projector jack adjusted
the cumbersome apparatus and thought deeply about the
ninth planet while michelson fussed around bunch fixing
the corresponding headphones of the receiver on the
youths head

  for a time the sensations received by bunch were a
mere blur then he made out some dim shadowy figures
which became clearer and clearer as time passed finally
they moved they lived they acted before his minds
eye a drama which had taken place centuries before a
drama of greed and disaster

  well queried jack as bunch held up a hand to de-
note that he had sensed enough

  youll never recover the ninth piece said bunch its
in old pascals liner as were the others and you know the
ship is in old man joves interior now

  but how his object was to return the pieces to their
own planets and slaughter was the earth piece how
came it on jupiter

  just human greed old pascal was especially fright-
ened of the evil influence of slaughter the statuette being
fashioned from human bone so he handed it over to his
priest to bury it in a lunar desert knowing the value
of the trinket the priest faked the burial and smuggled
the piece into the liner again to that pascal attributes
the terrible disasters which befell theship culminating in
the slaughter of the crew sacrificially by the jovians

  just before he died the priest confessed his crime and
told pascal who like the others was bound for sacrifice
that it was hidden in the panelled walls of the space liner
so you see old bean youll have to content yourself with
eight pieces not nine

  but jack pursed his lips grimly

  we shall see was all he said

  jack had had the asteroid completely refitted from stem
to stern the most eminent chemists in the land had in-
spected the porous shell and it had been plated and
double-lined in such a manner that whatever friction it
might be exposed to no reoccurence of the diffusion pheno-
menon could eventuate the cabins had been even more
luxuriously appointed more powerful engines safer
braking mechanism more up-to-date air flasks and the
last word in scientific instruments had been installed in
a word the ship was the dernier cri in speed comfort
and efficiency

  he soon had a plan of action he determined to do
nothing less than raise pascals space flyer bodily out of
the tacky jovian fluid the apparatus he assembled was
modelled after that used for raising sunken submarines
he proposed to render the ship air-tight if it had not
sunk too low then to compress the jovian gases and pump
the ship full of them this would drive the sticky fluid
out of the ship through a small aperture just as sub-
marine engineers do with compressed air to release the
sea-water as the ship filled with gas it would lighten
and gradually rise to the surface


wonder stories for august 

  everything was soon in order and an advertisement
broadcast for a crew despite the high wages offered
no space-faring men appeared in answer on the second
night jack repeated the broadcast doubling the previous
offer and having pictures of-the reconditioned asteroid
transmitted via the international televisor but still there
was no reply

  on the fourth day captain drake appeared

  its no use pronounced the veteran shes known
as a hoodoo from pluto to mercury and you wont get
a solitary spaceman to risk his carcass on her if you
offer all the incas treasure theyre a clannish lot these
spacemen the history of the asteroids last trip and the
spell put on her by the platinum planets is a byword
over the whole solar system

	jack flicked his cigarette bosh

  it may be bosh answered drake but it puts the ki-
bosh on the expedition-at any rate in the asteroid of
course im not superstitious myself but well-i never
walk under ladders just in case-you know so if youre
determined to sail the asteroid youll have to get an-
other captain

  jack argued and cajoled but all to no purpose drake
was adamant he would not sail and if he would of
what use was a captain without a crew

  take the damn ship to the brokers said jack irri-
tably at last and sell it for scrap this things getting
on my nerves then ring up the interplanetary trans-
port co and charter a special itll be a poor kind of
tortoise compared with the asteroid but i suppose itll
have to do

  yea cried bunch excitedly we can get off within a
week oh boy wont it be swell

  jack eyed his younger brother coldly there is no
we about it  am going you are not

  i say jack i    like that first chance i have of a
bit of adventure and you stop my going

  jack waved his hand angrily im taking jacko the
young jovian he may be useful you wouldnt its
not a k    

  oh i know that little piece myself now interrupted
bunch disgustedly its   not   a  kids   game  
and  wait  till  you   grow hang it all man cant
you see i have grown im two inches taller than you
bunchs pleadings were all to no purpose his elder
brother might hardly be his old self-the years of search-
ing had ragged his nerves-but he had still his uncom-
promising will when he said a thing he stuck to it if
the heavens fell so before the week was out he had sailed
into space leaving bunch disconsolate behind

  the chartered special had been christened hearts de-
light by the poetically inclined transport directors but
the spacemen called her the space pig a less euphon-
ious but more accurate description she lumbered heav-
ily along admittedly overloaded by the heavy lifting gear
destined to raise pascals liner had to be laid up at the
martian repair depot for a couple of weeks and gener-
ally behaved well up to her nickname in the jovian
tempestuous belt she was well-nigh unmanageable and
jacks nerves already frayed were strained almost to
breaking point he began to lose sleep

  the smallest thing would send him into a choler his

sense of proportion vanished he had one fixed idea to
possess the ninth planet by hook or by crook

  at long last they penetrated the wind belt and navi-
gated the pig round to the site of pascals buried liner
as they descended jack glanced through the floor port
he rubbed his eyes had then his senses left him he
pinched himself there below on the rapidly enlarging
landscape lit by the erupting volcano pascals liner float-
ed easily on the sea of pitch

  the first shock over the explanation seemed simple
the reaction from the asteroids rocket had caused the
ship to be sucked down as they had seen but it had re-
mained air-tight and when the disturbance subsided had
come to the surface again

  so much less work for us thought jack and straight-
way he began to give instructions as to the building of a
raft-bridge across the semi-fluid surface

  the work proceeded fast and in a few hours jack was
able to enter the liner as he drew near he noted with
some misgiving the unmistakable marks of grappling irons
on the hull jacko accompanied him he was the only
man who could proceed without the pilling suits and rock-
et boots

  as they neared the door jacko whined in fear point-
ing to an improvised bridge of brushwood coming from
the opposite direction it was clear the jovian feared
that this had been built by the priests from whom he
had so narrowly escaped and that once more they had
taken up residence within the liner

  jack drew his ray tube then he noticed lying on the
staircase an oxy-acetylene cutting tool his heart sank
someone had stolen a march on him no jovian had used
such a tool excitedly he entered with jacko clinging
close the ship was empty but it was ankle deep in the
clinging mud while the walls dripped slowly the same
treacly mass obviously the ship had but recently come
to the surface

chapter vii
murder

 with heart thumping and stomach falling jack made
his way to the place in the panelled wall where pascal
had indicated the statuette was hidden he gave a dis-
mayed shout the panel had been blasted away at the
precise spot and there instead of slaughter was the
ensign namur a notorious space rover

  as fast as he could jack retraced his steps to the brush-
wood track the track he saw carried over a low dune
to the right and despite jackos restraining arm he would
have followed the track into the rovers nest beyond had
not a whirring come to his eyes from above he raised
his eyes a giant space-liner was sailing easily above
them it was namur

  jack fairly flew to the space-pig he would fight the
pirate oh that he had the asteroid instead of this fly-
ing pig ray tubes were put into order and a large rock-
et discharged but the pirate had other ideas he dart-
ed gracefully upwards and kept on going jack darted
upwards too as gracefully as one can expect a pig to
move and kept on after him half a dozen times jaok
nearly lost track of the pirate ship as they fought through
the platinum planets



the wind belt but by sheer doggedness he kept the space
pig at the others heels

  followed an epic chase grunting like its prototype
the pig wallowed after its prey the pirate showed no
tendency to fight but seemed to take a delight in tanta-
lizing the pig allowing her almost to reach ray range
and then putting on phenomenal speed and leaving her
like a swallow leaving a slug it goaded jack to distrac-
tion

  he sighed a hundred times a day for the asteroid it
was soon evident that the pirate was intending to curl in-
to the mars orbit jack consulted his instruments the
mars-earth mail ship was almost due that was the pirj
ates lay to attack the mail ship

  whatever jack did he could not increase his ships
speed beyond a pigs pace day after day the pirate ship
drew steadily ahead presently through their instru-
ments they saw the pirate draw in his ensign and make
straight into the path of the mail-boat as the latter
drew near namur veered round and sailed parallel to
the postal flier a communicating tube shot out between -
the two boats

  jack thrust forward the space-pig recklessly in an
endeavor to assist the mail-ship but all to no purpose
long before he was within hailing distance the mail-ship
was on its way again no doubt in charge of namurs min-
ions the pirate ship hovered leisurely behind as though
to await the attentions of the space-pig

  as soon as he got within range jack played his devasta-
ting rays on the ship the pirates liner shone with a
blue haze for a moment but there was no disintegration
as he had anticipated nor did namur reply in kind

  its uncanny said jack either weve been loaded
up with dud ray-generators or else namur has secured our
patent insulator which we fitted to the asteroid

  drake smiled grimly ive been watching her ever
since she set out she is the asteroid

  lord what a fool i was to scrap her said jack beside
himself namur has read the whole case snapped up the
ship manned it with his minions and robots and beat mo
at my own game well well negotiate with him id
give half the world for slaughter 

  wed better beat it while the goings good counselled
drake this hulks a swine and namurs ruthless be-
sides youve got a touch of space-fever youd better get
to bed

  but jack turned a deaf ear his mouth was parched
his eyes were hot and dry and he could hardly hold up his
throbbing head but he asked himself was he to give
up the seal of his lifes work for a comic opera pirate and
a headache

	the pirate ship was coasting along at an easy hundred
miles a minute and even the slow going space-pig
had little difficulty in overtaking her soon they were bow
to bow mutual attraction holding them lightly together
the pirate offering not the slightest- resistance efforts
were made immediately to open up communication but
not the slightest reply was vouchsafed

queer commented drake perhaps the mail-ship
crew overpowered them and left the asteroid derelict
its a chance cried jack his eyes shining feverishly
sling the companion tube through im going aboard
protest was useless in spite of the fevers spate jack

was as impetuous as even he cursed the men impatient-
ly while communication was being made between the two
ships then lurched unsteadily through the opening jacko
would have followed him but he barked him back
fiercely and stumbled into the pirate ship alone the
asteroid was just as he had fitted it but it was illumed
with a weird green glow at first he could see no one
then in the dim light he made out the figure of a man
with a strange metallic face then another and another
standing motionless namurs robots

  take me to your master he jerked out instantly
two of the robots with mechanical steps arranged them-
selves on either side of him a third bringing up the rear

  the mechanical men moved forward by a kind of link
motion and jack dragged his fever-tortured limbs in the
same direction presently they halted before his own
cabin of yore the door opened and he was gently
thrust forward into the room

  the cabin was lighted with the same ghostly glow a
heavy curtain partitioned off a segment of the room on
the far side he stood for a moment listening the
robots turned and jerked out of the room the door closing
behind them he took a step forward a voice came
from behind the curtain

  qui va id

  its me jackthorpe r stammered jack and his
voice sounded harsh and cracked even to himself as he
held on to the table to steady his shaking limbs sell
me slaughter and ill give you a million

  a soft laugh was the only reply from behind the cur-
tain

  two millions

  mtds non

  five millions ten listen ill give you half my
radium fields

  again that soft mocking laugh of denial

  all my radium fields then you shylock

  mtds non  again came the laughing reply and then
in tones of finality the words bon nuit

  mad with covetousness and fever jackthorpe went ber-
sck he could see the bulge of the mans body against the
curtain in a trice he had lifted a heavy microscope
stand with both hands he raised it above his head and
crashed it against the figure outlined on the cloth he
heard the thud of the body as it fell to the ground with
hands that were trembling from more than space ague he
drew aside the curtain and stepped over the body in the
green glare he searched here there and everywhere for
what he sought but it was not to be found

  there were dinosaurs teeth and coral amulets little
wooden gods and uncut garnets pterodactyl skins and in-
cense burners but the ninth piece of the platinum plan-
ets was nowhere to be seen in his desperation he tore
up the flooring but all to no purpose finally worn out
by his exertions and the fire burning within him jack col-
lapsed weakly on the ground

  he was lying on something warm and soft his hand
felt wet and slimy ah yes he remembered now he had
murdered a man murder that was what the old leg-
end said the nine planets could never be collected with-
out a murder but where was the piece the fates had
tricked him he had done the murder but they were
withholding hjs reward

in the year 

 by otfrid von hanstein

translated from the german by
laurence manning and konrad schmidt

	bela was sitting trembling in the house what would
happen next would the other machines now learn of
the death of their companion and attack the buildings in
revenge she ate no dinner that night for fear of the
serving robot nothing could have persuaded her to go
into the kitchen where there were so many arms and
levers she spent the night fully dressed and wide awake
ready at any moment to flee into the jungle when the great
attack should commence but nothing happened at
least she heard the shrill sirens announce the new day
she rose and peered cautiously out-of-doors the great
machines moved ponderously on their usual routes indif-
ferent to everything but their immediate duty she laughed

  just like people nobody mourns the dead

  with the customary mechanical smile the servant ma-
chine presented her breakfast yet was it the same smile
did it not seem as if some hidden meaning could be read
in it this morning perhaps the morning chocolate was
poisoned but she had alreadydrank it she watched
for symptoms of poisoning half credulously then she
pulled herself together and stepped outside there lay
the collapsed bull it looked at least to her like what it
really was-a badly damaged conglomeration of steel
shovels gears and wheels she sent the alarm to the
mechanical department boarded her car and set out for
the control station as usual



what has gone before

  in the year  all of the cities of the earth except
berlin are underground due to destructive downpours of
meteors that strike the earth the people are emotionless
and are either mechanical breeders of children or workers
emotion has been forgotten grando blanco a young en-
gineer is engaged in driving a shaft deep into the earth to
be used for transportation between continents his cousin
bela wilson is secretly in love with him bela must choose
between being a mother or a knabina worker being a
throwback to a more emotional age she wants love her
uncle gives her work supervising a mechanical farm unin-
habited by any other human beings and here bela is
frightened by the mechanical monsters that she must deal
with

  meanwhile there is bad blood between the blanco or white
race and the nigro or black race and the asiatics san
bell a negro employed by the whites comes to the emperor
of africa and promises to overthrow the whites during
a meteor fall over berlin he will discontinue the current
that raises a protective barrier over the city and allow mil-
lions to go to their death

  near berlin in a cave is a doctor werner who still
believes in the importance of emotions in human life he
has been engaged in transplanting limbs and organs from
destroyed human bodies and so making new bodies

	in the second part of this tremendous story of

          the distant future we will see dangerous and
       epoch-making projects of the human race under
       way below the earth lies the mysterious un-
       known above from the heavens is the aiways-
       present danger from meteors lurking in the
       background is the curious race hatred brewing
       plots and new wars on three continents for the
       destruction of millions

         these are the dangers that our emotionless
      people of the year  must face we may
      know how we of the hectic th century might
      face them but how will people without
      love or fear meet the menace from both the skies
      and the depths of the earth

          herr von hanstein will tell us as this story
       progresses to its powerful climax

   everything was different today she was still unable
to overcome the feeling that she was surrounded by
enemies even the grandeur of nature before her was
somehow frightening toward midday a new noise
struck her ears looking up she perceived an entire
squadron of space ships slowly approaching they fin-
ally stopped just above her a small vehicle descended
upon a parachute and landed close to her station a man
stepped out and came lip to her

   my name is jack sontro is sinjoro wilson in the
central he spoke curtly and clearly

   sinjoro wilson is away

  may i ask who you are

   bela wilson

   here is a letter for you then we have come to take
in the crop ill be back later and take your answer to
the letter if you wish to make one

   the quiet farm was transformed into a scene of great
activity the space ships descended to within a few feet
of the ground great hose-like funnels were let down into
-the store-houses where the cacao cotton wheat etc were
collected--automatically stored there by machines up
the funnels thousands of tons were sucked in a short time
into the holds of the ships bela gazed in awe for a
while then she thought of the letter it read

       the probation period is over you must now
     decide whether you wish to retain your position
     on the farm permanently if not you have two

wonder stories for august 

  days at the motherhood institute in new york to
  sinjoro lopez

                            the supervisor

	sinjoro lopez was that not the bestial person she
had seen in her fathers office never to remain
here with these terrible machines she shivered at the
thought then a smile appeared on her countenance
knabina in grando blancos department of whom else
had she been thinking for weeks had he requested her
for the assignment why not how else could it have
happened that she was particularly assigned to his work
there was nothing to decide she would go to him
jack sontro reported again after two hours

  and what is your answer he saw in her nothing
but another knabina-an inferior being tolerated only for
her usefulness

  i desire to be assigned to the department of sinjoro
grando blanco

  when does sinjoro wilson plan to return

  tonight

  bela was glad she would not have to explain her decision
to her uncle she could not have avoided mentioning the
affair of the night before and he would certainly have
made fun of her

  jack sontro nodded

   yon had better return at once to central leave a report
for sinjoro wilson and get your things together in half
an hour the space ship will leave please dont cause any
delay

  the swift little car brought her hack to the buildings
there was little to prepare for her voyage to europe
after dictating a phonographic report for john wilson she
returned to the control station near which floated the
vessel

  high time get inside

  she had hardly had time to think in thosefew minutes
and now the space ship was already on its way with
one last glance she embraced the departing landscape
she felt sad to leave it what a paradise it could have
been if only one understanding soul had been her
companion but before this thought was complete
everything disappeared from view

	  

  the space ship descended again mountains and val-
leys emerged from the monotonous clouds beneath and
finally the vessel made fast to the great mooring-mast of
the brocken airdrome

  take this car it will get you to your destination
in three minutes

  the narrow valley at which she arrived was tremen-
dously confusing for untold numbers of outlandish ma-
chines created a deafening din bela could hardly
breathe in the damp close atmosphere she stood in
front of a low building face to face with grando blanco

  grando she could not express the jubilant wel-
come she felt

  grando looked older and more serious than formerly
he gave her a fleeting glance oh bela wilson
you want to join my working force as knabina well
lets try it sinjorina wells over there will give you the
necessary instructions he seemed indifferent and un-
concerned and turned away in company with ben vin-
tros

 it was fortunate that the working day had just ended
 so bela could hide her disappointment nobody noticed
 her in the dormitory as she sat with her face in her
 hands

chapter v

the foolish prophet

 	lillian wells had assigned bela to her duties it had
 not been an easy task for bela was really unfit for
 anything

 can you make an astronomical observation do you
 know how to register from a telescope

 i have no idea

 but have you perhaps a knowledge of chemistry
 nor that either

 why-havent you been at the knabina training in-
 stitute

 i was intended for a different career

 this woman with the masculine body glanced signifi-
 cantly down belas figure

perhaps that would have been better for you

 i should have never- belas eyes flashed but she
 bit off her words she did not care to reveal her thoughts
 to this sexless worker

 lillian wells misunderstood her emphatic objection and
 showed for the first time a friendly smile

 you are right they are a subordinate class of wo-
 men animals we thinking women aim to cease being
 creatures of passion and birth and to become individuals
 equal if not superior to men at least i must give you
 credit for your attitude but tell me-what kind of work
 can you do

 for the last month i have been operating the central
 control station on the farm santa machina

 and why didnt you stay there

 frankly speaking i was afraid to be alone with the
 machines-they seemed almost thinking creatures

 a mocking smile played on lillians lips

 simply because you did not understand machinery
 i will put you in the department where they make the huge
 earth-shovels once you see such a monster constructed
 everything will seem different

 everything was so highly specialized and human labor
 reduced to such a minimum that even bela found a sphere
 of useful activity her new duties required her to spend
 eight hours a day at an automatic control similar to that
 at santa machina the difference was that now she as-
 sembled machines instead of supervising their operation
 before her beneath a glass cover lay replicas in minia-
 ture of all the parts which lay outside ready for assembly
 beside her was a talking machine which explained the en-
 tire process of construction

beam number one to be welded to beam number
seven

 bela pushed several buttons and observed how a magnet
 pressed the two miniature beams together

 now the welding point commanded the mechanical
 instructor

 she pushed the proper button and the automatic appara
 tus did its work

 derricks for lifting the-joined beams

bela manipulated the controls and a derrick lifted the
in the year 



beams into their places in the base of the shovel being
assembled

  bring in beam number eight

  the phonograph of course was only used for train-
ing a new knabina while its voice rang out bela had
to concentrate intensively on her work and could not for
a moment take her mind off what she was doing at the
risk of spoiling the entire structure

  during the first day lillian wells superintendent of
knabinas stood behind her nearly all the time bela
could feel her keen glance the room
in which she worked was of oblong
shape throughout the room were set
tables similar to belas with a knabina
in front of each operating the controls

these were somewhat similar to the
keyboard of a typewriter bela felt
that these knabinas did not like her

  she was young and attractive in a
feminine way they had given all that
up when they undertook to prepare for
their careers how learned they all
were they manipulated all sorts of
machines which bela did not even know
by name they seldom spoke but
when they did speak they referred to
problems which did not even interest
her mind thought machines were for-
bidden during working hours bela felt
ignorant and inferior when comparing
herself with her coworkers yet at
times this would seem all wrong and she felt pity for them
she was after all the only true woman there

  now and then grando blanco passed quickly through
the room he stopped occasionally to have some concise
and brief conversation with lillian wells-giving orders
or perhaps commenting on the work in hand bela would
look shyly at him thinking how handsome and manly he
was was it possible that he did not see her at all did
no feminine charm appeal to him

  after working hours life went on almost the same as in
the cities great numbers of airships had been provided
to carry the workers to temote recreation centers but
grando blanco had put a stop to this the lunar obser-
vatories had predicted cataclysmic falls of meteoric mat-
ter grando did not want to risk any delay by the pos-
sibility of a number of his workers being killed athletic
fields had been established in the construction camp where
the men and knabinas pursued all sorts of sports in
their scant clothes their brown sun-burned bodies gave
them the appearance of savages sport was no longer the
wholesome healthy amusement of earlier days but an
everlasting and very serious attempt to achieve new re-
cords bela on the advice of lillian wells put on a
sport dress and joined them she was a little embarrassed
in her revealing costume among all these lean and sexless
knabinas

  one day grando was there how handsome his slim
brown body looked his eye sparkled as he threw the
heavy hammer farther than anyone else present he no-
ticed bela and came up to her playfully he felt her arm
to test her biceps

  training do you call that muscle you are posi-
tively fat you need training and exercise look at

edith vintros hers is almost a mans body she has
strength and energy and will-power yet she looked just
like you when she came to us at your age

  bela felt a flash of jealousy but then she did look at
edith vintros there was nothing feminine about her any
longer she looked at herself in the mirror that evening
the looking-glass was no longer an indispensable of
toilet but standard gymnasium equipment vanity was
still alive but it centered on strength and efficiency rather
than appearance the flaming ambition of all workers
was to contribute in some way to the
mastery of nature

  it was a beautiful evening bela
was tired and felt no desire to be
trained by lillian wells and made fun
of by the other knabinas she had
hurried away right after work-even
foregoing dinner which was served in
the camp cafeteria from the central
kitchens she took a walk up the for-
est-covered mountainside which ex-
tended above the cavern into which
grando blanco bored his tunnel deep-
er and deeper she came to a little
pavilion and entered there were
never any people here in this mater-
ialistic age no one had any interest in
charming views she sat down look-
ing out over the landscape she felt
desperate as people do who cannot fit
into their surroundings the slopes of
the hartz mountains stretched before her the huge old
trees rustled their evensong as though they wanted to tell
the lovely girl that they too were sad it was entirely
beautiful the last gleam of the sinking sun shone on
the tree tops little pink clouds moved lazily in the sky

	bela was not the only sad person in the world will
gernhold had left professor werners hospital after a
hard day the professor had achieved a number of things
lately only recently he had succeeded in implanting
an eye which he had kept alive for weeks in serum into
the face of a patient he was now devoting his time to
the greatest task of his life he would try to transplant
a living heart he had not yet attained this on human
beings but proposed to do so he had already succeeded
in keeping hearts alive in serum and was just waiting an
opportunity will gernhold had left him brooding over
this problem

  he was a dreamer slender and untrained physically
there was not in his eye that energy which fired grando
blanco for instance to great deeds professor werner
however looked upon him with affection for he understood
his theories and sympathized if only he could find a
mate for gernhold he would say to himself but at
this point he would shake his head sadly was gern-
hold really the proper and fit man to found a new race-
a race of feeling friendly humans they must be healthy
and wholesome as well thought the professor and pursed
his lips soberly as he eyed will gemholds frail body
if he did find the right girl might there not result a race
of weaklings

  will gernhold walked rapidly up the slope of the moun-
tain for his heart was young and strong he often came

wonder stories for august 

to the little pavilion but when he came to it and entered
to be alone with his thoughts he saw bela wilson her
feminine charms were heightened under the pale light of
the rising moon her eyes were large and dreamy will
had never seen a girl like this before he had no thought
receiver with him but he did not need one to tell him that
he had found a kindred spirit

is it not gorgeous up here he said in a low voice
bela was a trifle startled then she suspected the re-
mark had been ironic for she was accustomed to ridicule
on sentimental matters but when she looked into wills
eyes she nodded

   yes it is beautiful-just as it was at santa machina
when the machines had ceased work

   will stared pensively at the view

   thousands of years ago a great poet said the world
is perfect everywhere except where man is 

   bela came to her feet unconsciously

   and with his ugly cold heartless machines

   these two young people felt like old companions al-
though they had never met before will looked at bela
in sudden revelation here she was the girl he had
sought-who could understand a wave of happiness
swept over him was this the love of which he had read
in the professors ancient books how beautiful she
was how utterly different from the other heartless
knabinas and yet she was not of the professional moth-
er class-those unfeeling women who had degraded them-
selves by bearing the children of men they did not love
providence-in whom people no longer believed-had
brought this girl to him he thought

   but bela was unaware of the young mans emotions she
had no thought machine and could only judge him by his
words which had seemed mere commonplaces besides
she was thinking of grando blanco-and could not even
have told what the man will gernhold looked like

   they sat side by side for a time in friendly conversation
bela told him about santa machina and the fields and
jungles around it then will escortcd her home through
the darkness in the hall of the dormitory she met lillian
wells

  where have you been i missed you at the spear-
throwing

   the note of criticism coming so suddenly after her peace-
ful evening jarred on belas nerves

   do my duties include spear-throwing even if i dislike
it

   not exactly but   

   i have been walking on the mountain

   in the company of the doctors assistant

   are knabinas forbidden to speak to men

   the question made lillian indignant

   i warn you a knabina who forgets herself-who   
bela stiffened i dont care to hear any more i
know how i have to behave perhaps i know more of
feminine decency than you do

   bela

   instruct me in my enforced duties but leave me to
supervise my own private life yes i have spoken to a
man-spoken about things more worth while than spear-
throwing but i didnt even notice what he looked like-
as a man he did not interest me in the least

   why should such a thing interest a knabina

  good night

  lillian wells shook her head this bela wilson was
a rebel and they would have to get rid of her sooner or
later

	  

  at about the same time will gernhold was returning
to the professors dwelling

  why what has happened to you you look as though
you had just received good news

  with sparkling eyes will told him about his meeting
with the young girl the professor listened attentively

  i must make the acquaintance of this bela wilson
said the professor

  for a month the huge boring machines had been eating
their way into the interior of the earth deep down beneath
hermans cave the shaft had a diameter of over ten
feet a great cutting tool the invention of thom alva
made in the form of a tube with same width as the shaft
rotated rapidly rapidly as it sank into the rock the
tube was of hard metal and the cutting edge was covered
with diamond chips under great pressure the tool de-
scended a yard a minute when its core was filled with
rock and earth it was raised to be emptied and another
cutting tube descended to take its place

  grando blanco and ben vintros stood in the cave at
the entrance to the shaft like all workmen near the ma-
chines their ears were plugged with cotton even thought
transmission was impossible through the terrific din
creatsd by the boring machines oxygen helmets and
complete diving suits were also a necessity for the swirl-
ing clouds of dust penetrated everywhere in the cave
gleaming under the artificial sunlight

  up above on the surface was a scene of great activity
also for the piles of rocks and earth from the excavation
would have buried the valley were it not constantly being
removed to facilitate this removal a steel belt filled
an entire roadway for many miles bearing the rock far
from the scene of digging every few days an extra
length of the moving belt was added as required the
surrounding country was used as one vast dumping-heap
--whole valleys filled in with detritus

	grando blanco stood before his apparatus count-
ing every hour the cutting tool sank  feet
farther into the earth in three actual working days two
miles of depth was added this did not satisfy grando
blanco

  we are going too slowly as we are going now we
will not do  miles a year it would take us twenty
years to finish the shaft and we cannot afford that
then we must construct a cutter that will descend
seven feet a minute

  even so it would require ten years

  well then lets make it fourteen feet a minute

  the suggestion was almost insane-if such a term could
be used in technical affairs of that age

  ben vintros was again brooding over plans between
each two working shifts there was a rest period of one
hour this gave grando who permitted himself scarcely
any rest an opportunity to make inspection tours in the
shaft his elevator had the appearance of one of the
cutting tubes but its sides were fitted with heat-proof
glass and it was equipped with powerful searchlights in
in the year 



it he descended to inspect the rocky walls whenever he
found an area of softer stone he ordered it to be blasted
out at regular intervals in niches thus created he had
set up a series of substations to house supplementary ma-
chinery

  often subterranean rivers were discovered and these
had to be filled with heavy metal plates usually these
were small but in a few cases quite large tunnels were
opened in such cases the water was evacuated by pumps
and the space utilized for housing machinery or for pro-
viding sleeping quarters for workmen life was not
pleasant in these cross galleries especially at this time
when the cutting tubes would race by filled with rock
the terrific air suction would pull a man into the main
shaft if he were not careful even to stand at the end
of the gallery and look down the shaft would have been
certain death

  new cutters had been constructed some seven feet in
height the power was lavishly applied the deeper
the shaft was driven the softer became the rock they
were already about to start a new kind of cutter to work
these were slightly smaller in diameter and had an elas-
tic outer shell of insulating and heat-resisting metal this
outer shell provided a sort of caisson remaining in the
shaft while the inner tool was removed with its load of
rock

  then a new cutting cylinder entered the old shell and
bored it still deeper at the same time the shaft above
was reinforced with heat-resisting cylinders which de-
scended as the cutting point prepared the way at the
end of the first month the shaft was  miles in depth
by that time a great chamber had been blasted on one
side of the tunnel to act as a new center of operations and
drive the shaft still deeper during the installation of
the machinery five days were lost but on the other hand
the rock was getting softer now and greater speeds were
possible

  grando blanco as the work progressed remained down
in the shaft a week at a time conditions were made
livable by a forced-draft atmospheric conditioner and
huge refrigerating apparatus

	  

  bela spent her evenings at the pavilion on the mountain
will gernhold however was rarely in her company pro-
fessor werner had advised him to stay away

  you must give her time no matter what her nature
is dont forget that she has been brought up to believe
in the customs of the present generation give her books
if she knows how to read

  she has read a number of books already

  i will select some books for her

  so bela read in the pavilion by the light of a pocket
lamp instead of spending her evenings at sports where the
knabinas would have made fun of her she would read
of by-gone days when there were still homes and families
in the world-of happy children and loving parents her
cheeks aflame with enthusiasm she would think of grando
blanco and wonder how she could convert him if only
he would read such a book for himself 

   

  a few miles from halberstadt was one of the game
fields blanco had established for his workers a valley
had been filled with broken rock from the shaft and

made into a level plain electricity had been installed
in this field making it possible to practice here those
sports which mr cook and his assistant bob white in
the city of santa scientia centuries before had devel-
oped racing automobiles could by the push of a lever
be transformed into vehicles for air travel football
players would be thrown miles by electric current the
greally amplified muscles of the athletes limbs would
throw the spears enormous distances tennis golf and
other sports of ancient vintage were practiced here on a
grand scale

  knabinas wrestled or engaged in boxing matches or
staged gymnastic exercises in groups of thousands

  bela wilson was on the field for lillian wells had
caught her reading and was very much shocked lil-
lian was trying to find some excuse to get rid of this girl
but bela did her duties conscientiously during the work-
ing hours she felt that bela would never become a true
knabina but with silent and stubborn resistance follow
her own will lillian had seized the books and thrown
them into a nearby furnace senseless drivel she
called them

  bela shook her head on the contrary she replied
they are records from better days

  lillian wells had compelled her to go out to the sports
field with her

  here is true progress she said here the strength
and beauty in womanhood has triumphed over the weak-
ness of sex she is now about to subdue nature com-
pletely

  bela listened indifferently she had read books-she
knew that other people felt as she did-and she smiled
quietly

  grando blanco was also on the field his face was
peaked and strained from his long stay in the depths of
the earth yet he sat his racing car like a greek god as
he sped about after awhile he approached bela on foot

  grando bela had unconsciously shouted the name
and had to keep herself from flinging her arms around
him

  he laughed at her

  well little bela you still here i had almost for-
gotten about you are you getting accustomed to your
new life here have your ideas become reasonable yet

  who is this

  more reasonable than all of you who waste your lives
in work

  yes you who waste your lives

  it was not bela who spoke a tall gray-haired man
with a long narrow visage stood in the center of the field
speaking in a loud voice a group gathered about him
with laughing faces they enjoyed the opportunity of
making fun of the foolish professor

  he stood there his long white hair waving in the breeze

  yes you waste your lives you are insane enough
to believe yourselves gods whereas you are but erring
subjects of that great god in whom you do not any longer
believe you want to become supermen and forget the
greatest thing about humanity-love sacred love the
love of man and wife the love of the children you do
not deserve to have bom into your degraded motherhood
institutes

  turn back think of your souls read the books


wonder stories for august 

of the ancients stop your foolish battle against the eter-
nal laws of nature be what you were intended to be-
men and women do not lower yourself to the level of
the machines

  there was a burst of laughter from the crowd the
knabinas joined hands and danced around him in a ring-
hooting with derision bela stood there with wide-open
eyes she stared at this old man with the flying hair and
young voice and turned to grando blanco werner be-
gan to speak again but his words could not be heard in
the uproar blanco stood there calmly with a smile on his
face

grando help him cant you feel how right he is
his glance met belas he shook his head and mounted
the platform beside the professor he motioned the crowd
to silence bela stood on the ground betow enthusiastic
grando was a convert to the prophet

  quiet grando blanco looked about him with keen
eyes

  really are there not many among you whom this old
man has helped with his medical knowledge dont an-
noy him a man who has reached his skill and prom-
inence can afford fantastic theories surely his mind is
confused he cannot understand our age it is very un-
becoming to all of us to make fun of a slightly insane
person go on about your occupations leave him alone

  you professor werner return to your laboratory cave
and your scientific experiments the new world wants to
know nothing of the old and needs no prophet

  bela was desperate-utterly disappointed grandos
unexpected words tore her heart the crowd dispersed
quietly grando descended to the ground his lips were
curled in a mocking tolerant smile which hurt her to see

  have i done well have i protected the foolish mes-
siah from the madding crowd

  she looked at him with such sorrow in her eyes that
even grando felt uncomfortable under their scrutiny then
she ran up the steps of the platform her eyes were swim-
ming with tears

  master take me under your protection she broke
down at his feet he stooped and raised her in the kindest
manner

chapter vi

into the earth

	a jenkin chief engineer of the electric department
  stood before grando blanco

  the new power plant in the side gallery  miles be-
low the surface is completed and ready to operate but
there are various disturbances which i cannot account for

i fear they may be due to factors of which we have no
knowledge-perhaps new elements not yet discovered
grando nodded

  i will go down there myself you dont have to go
back the strain of the past few weeks is telling on you
get some rest

  grando himself had had very little rest lately he had
just returned from violent exercise on the field which had
terminated in the incident of professor werner he
turned and entered tee office of the knabinas lillian
wells approached him

  we must send bela wilson away

  why

  oh well the scandal on the sports field-fancy her
taking the part of this mad prophet

  is she unsatisfactory in her duties

  on the contrary she shows ambition

  does she violate any rules

  she goes her own way-is disliked by all and always
made fun of

  does she complain

  no in fact she doesnt seem to notice it

  well sinjorina we have the right to discharge a kna-
bina only if she refuses to do her duty or intentionally
violates rules and regulations with her private affairs
we are not concerned so long as they do not affect public
morals sport is a privilege but not a duty inciden-
tally the man whom you call a mad prophet is one of the
greatest physicians of all times let him have his little
humors and let bela wilson have hers

  i must say i like her to have a mind of her own as
to what the other knabinas think-well-i know nothing
about feminine beauty i have never taken any interest
in it having had more serious things to consider but i do
think she looks a great deal prettier than most other kna-
binas here probably they are a trifle envious but its
all right woman has achieved much since she has freed
herself from her primitive instincts but she retains one
little vice-vanity so much for bela wilson i have
something more important to talk about i need at once
a knabina to go down the shaft with me and to record on
the phonograph my observations

  during this conversation they had walked into the great
workroom grando was speaking in full tones bela
wilson stood nearby preparihg to take up her work she
approached the two talkers

  take me along

  i have to go very deep into the shaft- miles below
the surface

  all the better

  can you handle a phonograph

  i used to do it every day in santa maehina

  all right then come along

  although grando was perfectly indifferent to her charms
and suspected nothing of her love for him he took a
certain interest in his cousin lillian wells helped
bela prepare her equipment shaking her head doubt-
fully bela put on her diving suit and a moment later
stood in the elevator car beside grando as the car
began its mad plunge into the depths her heart beat
rapidly she had to devote all her energy to overcome
a sense of nausea

  fortunately the descent took only a few minutes the
car stopped and they got out conditions were very
much the same as on the surface except for the some-
what uncomfortable diving suit a spacious gallery
stretched out before them-illuminated by artificial sun-
light it was almost filled with machinery which con-
trolled the drilling of the shaft still further into the
earth

  grando had not spoken once his entire attention
was taken up by the control apparatus and register dials
he tested everything with a stop watch in his hand mak-
ing brief ejaculations into the transmitter which con-
nected him with bela who in turn dictated his curt re-
marks into the phonograph although their relation-
in the year 



ship was on a strictly business basis bela was joyful
she was his assistant she was permitted alone beneath
the earth with him to be of assistance in his work

  some half an hour had elapsed when the lights were
suddenly extinguished with a swift jerk of a lever
grando connected a storage battery and the light came
on again he sent a signal by telegraph hial mani-
pulated a few controls and hurried to the edge of the
main shaft thei-e was of course no work going on dur-
ing his investigations he felt with his hand the edge
of the opening a thread of hot water was running
down the wall

  hurry we have got to get up again something
is wrong with the machine above

he pushed bela into the elevator car and with breath-
taking speed they ascended to the first subterranean sta-
tion just below the surface they got out grando
had not stopped the car it had refused to go farther
hurry

  here again only the emergency lights were burning
grando seemed to have forgotten his companion she
followed him hurriedly with a feeling of anxiety it
became quite light as they found themselves in a large
gallery this was a natural system of grottos which they
had utilized and which in all likelihood extended for miles
throughout the entire mountain mass grando rushed in-
to a side grotto where a huge generator stood it was not
in operation for a jet of hot water was falling on it
looking up he perceived that a fissure in the arched roof
from which the water came was rapidly widening grando
leaped back-pushing bela before him a deafening
crash rent the air a huge piece of rock fell on the very
spot they had left a second before

  they were knocked down by the shock and lay for a
minute in complete darkness then grando pulled him-
self together he pressed his flashlight and turned to the
emergency lighting machine under his ministrations it
soon resumed operation the fall of rock had just missed
it

  now he looked about him the ceiling of the gallery
had caved in the mass of rock formed a mighty wall be-
tween their cavern and the main shaft making any exit
impossible by the way they had come grando had hast-
ily stripped off his diving helmet a low rustling noise
penetrated through the stone barrier bela had followed
his example and removed her helmet here only a mile
below the surface the air was sufficient for breathing prob-
ably there was some connection with the outer atmos-
phere through the cave system

	belas eyes expressed her horror although she uttered
no sound grando pushed a hammer against the wall
and listened carefully to the sound of each blow

  a subterranean hot spring has broken through at
any rate the exit is blocked and if it werent the elevator
is probably destroyed

  which means bela knew her danger without ask-
ing

  they may soon be looking for us to get us out of
here-but it is also possible that the shaft has collapsed
she admired his calmness she could not understand
her own calmness however she had a feeling of intense
happiness she had never experienced before for some
reason she did not want anybody to come here she was

 alone with grando what did it matter that there was
 danger-that they might perish here they would
 together

 grando was not thinking along the same lines

 it is very improbable that they would look us up here
 they would suppose us to be still at the lottom of the
 shaft

 there was a wireless receiver in the cave and he hur-
 ried over to this and listened in

 an influx of hot water occured in the shaft the shaft
 is filled up to the  mile station

 where is grando blanco

 he went down to the bottom with a knabina

 in other words he is probably lost

 yes unfortunately it is almost certain what is to
 be done

 pump out the shaft and call ben vintros to the scene
 any attempts to save blanco

 is it possible to get into the shaft

 not as long as the water is in there

 the water is almost  miles deep over him so there
 isnt much chance

 when can the pumping begin

 in three days we must get machines from outside
 arrange everything as quickly as you can keep
 blancos death secret for a time which knabina is with
 him

 bela wilson

 the above conversation was conducted between the sup-
 ervising engineer and the president of the construction
 board grando could understand every one of the words
 exchanged but the distress signals which he was contin-
 ually sending remained apparently unheard and then
 the receiver went dead some disturbance seemed to have
 suddenly prevented wireless communication to the sur-
 face the indifferent attitude of the president of the
 board did not seem heartless to blanco a mans life was
 not considered very important in this materialistic world
 he turned around and looked into belas terrified face
 we are doomed

 only the dead are hopeless one thing is certain
 however we cannot count on any help from outside
 during the next few days

 which means that we are lost

 he looked at bela and was somewhat astonished at the
 calm manner in which she spoke he had expected her
 to burst into tears

 its not my fault you joined me at your wish

 i am glad to be with you

 he looked at her in surprise but her meaning was not
 even then clear to him he interpreted her calmness as a
 sign of confidence in his ability to save her

 all right lets go over the machine first

 he inspected the generator once more

 i think it will last another few days then the fuel
 will be exhausted

 then we will be in the dark

 we have three small lamps with storage batteries
 these will last an additional three days in other words
 we must reach the surface in six days or    check up on
 the supply in that emergency food closet

 bela opened the door

 enough for at least two weeks

 thats taken care of then

   he piled some oiled rags in a heap and made a little
 fire

   what are you doing that for

   have you noticed that the atmosphere in here is quite
 fresh it means that there must be some connection to
 the outer atmosphere the smoke of the fire will give us
 a clue to the right direction

   grando had not reckoned wrongly the smoke rose
gently and was drawn to the back of the cave

   put out the fire take one of the lamps and come
along

   grando detached one of the metal ladders from the side
 of the machine this he leaned against the wall at the
 back of the grotto and ascended

   here is an opening he called but wait

   bela followed grando up the ladder and saw him crawl
 into the narrow passage

   remain outside

   she had to obey the order but saw him disappear with
 panic she was alone with a small miners lamp how
 the time dragged grando was gone a whole hour

   get me a dynamite cartridge and a fuse he asked
 she climbed down and obeyed silently when she hand-
 ed them up he disappeared once more another hour
 then he was back again he had ignited the fuse as
 he appeared above the ladder there was a slight detonation
 at the same time foul-smelling smoke came down the
 cave

   hold a cloth before your nose

   bela was suffering from nausea but grando seemed
to be unaffected then a smile appeared on his face

   the smoke is being blown away see lets hurry
now

   he opened one of the closets built into the rock walls
 can you carry this rope and these two lamps it
 was a heavy load but bela nodded grando himself was
 loaded with food cans a hammer a pickaxe and an iron
 crowbar as well as a long cable of wire on one end of
  which he connected a powerful electric bulb the other
 end of the wire was attached to the emergency light ma-
 chine in the cave

   lets go then the passage is narrow and low we
 will have to crawl and push our things before us

   they proceeded the passage was not only narrow
but obstructed by loose rock which grando first passed
back to bela and she in turn cast behind her the elec-
tric bulb on the wire gave a brilliant light

   here we are grando stopped stood on his feet and
 pounded with the pick against the rock before him the
 obstruction began to sway and then fell forward out of
 sight it must have fallen into a great depth beyond
 for there was no sound of the fall

   come along called grando his orders were very
concise

	they stood in the hole created by the blast before
them was empty space-a huge natural cavern of un-
known depth

   we will lower the cable with the lamp on it they
let it down slowly seventy feet that is just the
length of the rope hand me the crowbar and the
hammer grando seemed to be following some pre-
determined plan nothing puzzled him with powerful

blows he drove the bar into a crack in the rock and fast-
ened the rope to it

  can you climb down or shall i have to carry you
she was pleased at his offer but shook her head
thanks but i can do it myself

  well then go on ahead

  it was not a pleasant feeling to hang by ones hands
with the rope swinging back and forth she couldnt help
feeling that it would have been easier if he had gone first
and held the rope for her she reached the floor in safe-
ty-

  try to catch the cable when i throw it ready she
caught it she had by now become accustomed to his
brief orders-which at first had seemed almost rude

  anything down there you could fasten the cable to
he called

  there is a large stalagmite here

  will it hold my weight i have to fasten the rope
to the cable and slide down

  it will hold bela fastened the cable as best she could
and held it with all her strength

  i am coming he began to descend belas heart
was pounding there was a sharp crack and the soft
substance of the stalagmite began to give it broke and
bela fplt herself drawn up into the air holding the cable
desperately she braced herself with her feel against the
wall of the cave but was carried up some fourteen feet
into the air grando landed with a jar but was unhurt
he held the rope having seen what was happening i
will let you down slowly he said they stood beside
each other once more belas hands were badly cut

  if you had let go then i should have broken some
bones i suppose i must thank you now you are a
brave girl

  she felt as if she had been awarded a medal for gran-
dos compliments were few and far between

  he took up the bulb at the end of the cable and hung
it as high as he could on a stalagmite the entire cham-
ber was illuminated and they could see all its wonders
it was huge in the center of the cavern a lake could be
seen and into it poured a small waterfall cold water
the dome of the roof was very irregular and covered with
hanging stalactites which gleamed like icicles

  how glorious bela unconsciously exclaimed

  grando laughed  how beautiful said the hunter as he
looked at the charging elephant but you are a brave
girl for the second time he had praised her

  how could i be afraid when i am with you

  your confidence is very touching but down here i am
just a simple human without one of my machines to assist
me now lets make a fire-or can you use your hands
his concern for her was very pleasing grando
had brought along the remains of the oiled rags soon
a column of smoke was rising to the rocky roof

  are you repeating yourformer experiment

  yes but in addition to that we will heat two cans of
food for the human machine must be fed

  she prepared a meal while grando busied himself down
at the lake

  heres some more dinner for us can you cook
fish it was a strange sort of fish that grando had
caught in his hand where its eyes should have been
there protruded long feelers its color was greyish white
and its shape seemed distorted
in the year 



  good heavens how disgusting it looks

but if it only tastes good we wont have to look at it
grando went back to the lake bela was happy as never
before in her life everything was just as she had read
in her books here she was helping her man by pre-
paring his meal suddenly she called grando
whats the matter

  there is a bat fluttering around here in the cavern
that is wonderful news that proves there must be
some connection with the upper world

  smoke is moving in that direction she pointed out
  he took his binoculars out of his pocket

  there seems to be a hole up there-but how can we
reach it

  they ate their meal and then grando stretched out
on the rocky floor let us rest a few hours he said
we must conserve our strength in a few minutes he
was sound asleep he had not gone to bed for four
days

  bela however was too restless to follow his example
she was tremendously excited she went down to the
water the lake was not very large but apparently quite
deep for a moment she stood there in meditation then
she looked at her sleeping companion after removing
her clothes she made a bundle of them and fastened it
on her head she plunged in and swam across to the
other side two or three times she felt the blind denizens
of that lost water touch her it was a loathsome sensa-
tion she climbed out and dressed quickly not caring
that her clothes were not perfectly dry she stood at the
foqfc of the wall above which grando had seen the open-
ing

  bela he had awakened and looked about him
searchingly bela where are you he listened and
from far away came a faint answer he called again
here on the wall came the distant voice

  grando was alarmed and raised his binoculars had
the girl gone daft sure enough there she was high up
the side of the cave hanging to a protuberance and as he
looked she lifted herself up still farther how had she
crossed the water by swimming heplunged in him-
self clothes and all

  in a minute he was climbing up after her bela had
apparently found herself unable to go further small
pieces of stone crumbled down on him for the first time
he felt fear for another human being she was doomed
he imagined her hold giving way beneath her feet he
could see her already hurtling past him unable to help
her and falling to her death below

  i have reached the top she called to him

  she had crawled over the edge and lay there exhausted
he waited below in suspense at last she calledagain
there is another cave up here-and a great many bats
i will come up

  get the rope i brought a wire with me and can
lower it to pull things up

  fine

  how cleverly she had thought of everything he re-
turned for the rope and had to swim the pool twice more
she lowered the wire and pulled up the rope

  come ahead i have fastened it to a large rock
here

  coming

  grando ascended and soon stood beside bela he no-
ticed at once that she was completely exhausted

  you have been very careless

  i just wanted to prove that i too can accomplish
things-for you but grando did not grasp the signi-
ficance of her words i almost fell once when the
cable got tangled behind me but everything is all right
now she smiled at him happily but grando was al-
ready occupying himself about the business of their ul-
timate escape

  the passage goes up very steeply he remarked do
you think we can climb it

  not now i must rest dead tired she lay down
and slept

chapter vii

rescue

	grando returned to the lake twice more bringing back

  with him all their impedimenta he stood a moment
looking down at a sheet of mica set in a metal frame why
had he brought this along he could not account for it
except that it had been lying loose beside the machine
in the first grotto he had taken it with the oiled rags
and other material feeling that it might prove useful

  then he stretched himself beside his companion to
get some more rest some hours later a loud scream
awoke him

  the cave

  the first thing he noticed was the absolute darkness he
had been compelled to leave the bulb on the end of the
cable behind him in the cavern for it would not reach up
to the new passage

  the great bulb below had gone out but down there it
was not completely dark for a shimmering fluorescent
gleam covered the entire floor of the cave the air seemed
to be in motion fumes were ascending in swirling
clouds on one of the stalagmites a light appeared and
became extinguished again then another one appeared
and then several more it was st elmos fire-electric
discharges

  grando with sudden inspiration seized the plate of mica
and set it up in the entrance to the passage making it
airtight with stones and rubble bela kept staring through
the transparent window at the sight below

  lord in heaven

  from a great distance came an indistinct crash a
thick black stream was pouring into the huge cavern from
the passage by which they had originally entered boil-
ing hot water and broken rock crashed down to the floor
of the chamber then the bulb below flashed on momen-
tarily from time to time only to be extinguished in the
end probably the machine at the other end of the cable
was now completely flooded and out of order grando
felt for one of his flashlights but before he could turn
it on a great glare flamed up followed by a terrific de-
tonation flash after flash occurred the waters of the
little lake seemed whipped by a raging storm and the
thunder was multiplied by the crashing echoes

  bela had seized grandos arm and he held her close un-
conscious of his action the noise and light ceased but
then the cavern was suddenly illuminated as if by day-
light a huge ball of white light was slowly floating in


wonder stories for august 

circles on the water below it would rise slowly into the
air and descend again the water now covered the en-
tire floor of the cavern in the utter silence the sight was
uncanny and solemn grando removed the mica window
the air was pure and highly charged with ozone due to
the electric discharges then a rumbling noise was
heard the ball lightning had exploded and once more
they were in complete darkness

  in solemn tones bela said i feel as though god him-
self had been present

  grando did not understand why her words made such
an impression upon him he turned on the most power-
ful of the three flashlights

  i think it was our salvation the hot current has
found its way into this huge cavern and now its force is
exhausted we will try to get down cross the lake again
and return to the first cave it will now be possible to
give signals to the people above

  he had scarcely finished speaking when a great illum-
ination appeared in the tunnel high on the opposite wall
of the cavern

  is someone coming but that hope was a vain one
the light grew brighter and then a stream of white-hot
lava poured down like a flaming cascade into the water
below which hissed violently in a few seconds the en-
tire cavern was filled with yellow sulphurous fumes they
both worked feverishly to return the mica window and
wedged it in place with stones making the barrier as air-
tight as possible

  thank god that will keep the air breathable in here
at least the way back is no longer possible we can
remain alive for three days if by then we do not suc-
ceed in finding a way out-

  then we will die together

  she wanted to feel his arms about her but he had al-
ready limped towards the ascending passage

  you are limping

  yes when you were climbing up here a stone fell
and hit my ankle

  let me attend to it

  there is no time for that now

  out in the cave was a veritable inferno of steam and
flame and noise the crash of falling stalactites could
be heard then a ghost-like silence fell

  they forced themselves to eat once more the walls
were damp and a trickle of water served them for drink
the climb was a painful one up a steep tunnel bela
walked in front fastened to her companion by the rope
grando was greatly handicapped by his swollen foot

  if we only knew where we are the path seems to be
very steep but the air is tolerable

  but no light

  it was on the evening of the next day they had been
compelled to throw away the largest of their battery lamps
for its current was entirely discharged

  how do you expect to see light more than half a mile
below the surface

  the steep passage came to an almost horizontal tun-
nel its height was very irregular at times they could
scarcely see the roof above them and at other times they
were forced to crawl on hands and knees when they
became exhausted they lay on the hard floor trying to get
as much rest as circumstances would permit they ate
the last of their provisions

 we will have light for another half day

 the second battery had now been discarded and their
 last night was growing perceptibly dimmer

 i cant stand it any longer bela collapsed on the
 ground you go ahead grando and save yourself
 but he too had come almost to the end of his strength
 and his foot throbbed feverishly they both managed to
 find some sleep but had been too exhausted to think of
 conserving their battery when they awoke they were
 in darkness bela sat up passing her hand wearily
 across her forehead

 why grando isnt that  it is

 he was on his feet at her words a faint shimmer of
 light appeared in the distance mustering all his
 strength he took a few steps in that direction

 the light is growing stronger light bela light
 with new courage they proceeded haltingly toward its
 source and entered a small grotto

 what is this she said looking at the floor

bones the remains of animals but no human
bones is it a relic of prehistoric times it must be
through a narrow crevice in the wall poured bright
light but they were at the end of their strength they
fell exhausted they slept drunkenly when they awoke
again it was completely dark

 bela

grando

did i dream i thought we had daylight in the
grotto here

 we did have light but it has disappeared

 	they sat beside each other for some time in hopess
 silence bela leaned her head against his shoulder and
 wished he would hold her comfortingly but he sat in
 stupid indifference

 too bad i should have liked so much to finish the
 shaft before i died and there were so many other things
 i wanted to do it is a shame that a human being is such
 a weak thing

 bela did not reply she thought her own thoughts in
 the darkness i wanted nothing but to be with you-to
 die with you and even now you cannot understand
 suddenly the crevice showed bright grando jumped
 to his feet

 this is not daylight there is a cave beyond and
 there is a man in it hola there he shouted come
 on bela  shout so that he can hear us

 bela was unable to use her voice but grandos hail had
 been heard a face appeared in the aperture

 who is there

 bela violently overcome by relief began to sob she
 was looking at the kind face of the old professor just
 now it bore an expression of utmost astonishment

 a few words of explanation were exchanged

 have a little patience i will get you some refresh-
 ments first and then we will enlarge this crack so that you
 can get through

 chance-or was there a providence-had guided them
 to the very inmost room of that cave in which the old
 scientist had his laboratory

 be careful he warned them the work may cause
 pieces of rock to fall on you

 the pounding of the picks was sweet music to their
 ears werner and gernhold were working hard to re-
in the year 



 lease them the two prisoners were at a lower level and
 a ladder was thrust through the enlarged opening bela
 ascended first and fell into will gernholds arms half un-
 conscious he carried her into the upper chamber be-
 fore she fainted she could hear grandos words there
 is a very brave girl-that bela she will be a very useful
 knabina some day

  a smile was on her lips when her senses departed and
her body relaxed utterly

  grandos injured foot required medical attention and
belas weak condition made it necessary for her to remain
in the professors sanitorium but even before he would
permit the doctor to examine his hurt grando insisted
that he see his assistant lillian wells the news of his
miraculous escape spread like wildfire with lillian there
also arrived ben vintros he had just got back from the
lunar mines to take grandos place he shook grandos
hand warmly

  i am tremendously glad i must confess i was a lit-
tle nervous at the prospect of filling your shoes i know
far too little about your plans

  in any case i will ask that you now be permitted to
remain here i need a really competent assistant i was
lucky this time but this work is too important to hang on
the life of one man

  it did not seem inhuman to grando that vintros had
made no reference to his personal danger his life was
valuable only because of the work he could do

  and how is the shaft getting along

  we have made another twelve miles

  grando sat up with a pleased expression on his face
  then the shaft was not flooded

  it was not even necessary to establish pumping units
the flow soon ceased and the total result was merely to
soften the rock a little-more desirable than otherwise
but the -mile substation is ruined a few hours after the
water came the whole thing collapsed now the entrance
is completely obstructed with rock if the water still flows
it has probably found a secret way of escape in the in
terior of the cave system since we no longer require
that particular station we thought it best to abandon it
the disturbances at the bottom of the shaft have disap-
peared as mysteriously as they came everything now
goes along as usual

  grando blanco in turn briefly related his experiences
-mentioning belas courage and assistance

  sinjorina wells i should like you to honor sinjorina
wilson before an assembly of all the knabinas of the de-
partment in recognition of her courage and presence of
mind will you also please report to the supervisor of
the motherhood institute in new york

  lillian wells was chagrined but her orders gave her
no choice but to obey

	  

  bela wilson lay completely fatigued in a quiet gal-
lery professor werner was sitting at her bedside he
had taken a great interest in this young girl of whom will
gernhold had first spoken and who had taken his part so
sympathetically that day at the sports field he knew
that it would excite her to ask questions so he placed the
thought transmitter band around her forehead while she
lay there only half conscious the old man sat there read-
ing her very soul as her thoughts revealed themselves

  finally he rose very quietly and stroked her forehead
kindly

  meanwhile will gernhold had entered arid werner
motioned him to follow out of the room back in the
laboratory he - grasped wills hand sympathetically

  poor will

  gernhold looked at him why poor

  banish all thoughts of this girl from your mind she
will never love you her soul is full of a great sacred
love-but for another man it is very sad i have
found two understanding humans-a man and a woman
but they walk on diverging paths which will never meet
   

  the professor sat at grando blancos bedside the
bad ankle had been considerably aggravated by neglect
but was now properly bandaged there was a bitter
smile on his face while he did not object to the profes-
sors presence his remark was rather an involuntary ex-
pression of his thoughts than a desire to start a conversa-
tion with werner

  how imperfect is man much more helpless than he
thinks

  quite right

  grando seemed not to notice the interruption

  here we are with the best of machinery believing our-
selves the lords of the universe-capable of everything
and anything-but take us away from our machines once
we have to rely upon our own bodies we become helpless

  only a ridiculous chance saved us supposing the
station had had no connection with the surface suppose
that professor werner had not chanced for a month to
enter that outlying gallery and strike a light-we would
have starved to death within a stones throw of rescue
was it really chance

  what else could it have been anything that does
not come under understandable laws is chance

  do you really believe that

	grando grew restless under the solemn repetition of the

  professors question

  but yes

  there was a time when people used to look upon such
things in a different light sinjoro blanco you are de-
cidedly one of the most capable persons in our age now
listen to me for just five minutes

  suppose not chance but the creator of all things
whom you have all forgotten to trust suppose he had been
the one to save you-to show you the way out perhaps
he used bela wilson as his divine instrument suppose
he had designed it so that this untrained girl instead of
you with your clever scientific mind should be the one to
find the exit

  no-please let me speak you predict from your obr
servationp that a great fall of cosmic matter will take place
at such and such a time i do not know if you have ever
heard of a book called the bible at one time it was held
sacred by mankind it tells of such a catastrophe long
ago which swept away all humanity the book says that
the great creator himself had sent it because man had
deserved to perish may not this coming disaster be a
repetition perhaps his eternal patience has been ex-
hausted by the arrogance of your scientists-by the loss
of all spiritual values-by the unnatural relationship be-
tween the sexes your whole adventure and rescue is a

warning--it should tell you what a weak insignificant
thing a man really is he chose you-the most capable
among ua-to prove his point this great shepherd led
you back from death to life and labor

  grando blanco had listened calmly and was now look-
ing into werners face was this man mentally unbal-
anced he could not deny that his words had myster-
iously excited him he smiled weakly

  it would be a wonderful thought-if you were right
what a consolation if we could know that we are guided
--that our fate is already mapped out for us

  yoir are on the right track now

  grando shook his head slowly and sadly it is a
false idea unfortunately you are a scientist you
know that man is nothing but a higher class of animal in
evolutions great system as the sap circulates in the tree
so the blood makes its perpetual rounds in our body in
principle we are no different from other creatures when
we die we all lie on an equal level you dont maintain
for an instant that a tree has an immortal soul

  do you know all this

  yes certainly

  but i tell you man knows nothing-literally nothing
he may think he does we discover new physical phen-
omena and we play with them the more powerful our
telescopes the more stars we can perceive we are proud
of this the more our chemists learn the more powerful
weapons we have placed in our hands but what do we
know do we know the significance of the entire infinite
universe and its laws how was it created and what
is more why was it created

  the little worm in the earth has no eyes he does not
know what it means to see we are no better if it could
think the worm would perhaps think itself the lord of the
universe it can see no master we know nothing but
we can feel the faith in an immortal soul has persisted
throughout the ages it must have been implanted in us
by divine power the most powerful empires in history
have invariably collapsed when its people began to deny
their creator

  now once more a civilization is denying the universal
law well-it will perish as did the others if no change
occurs soon the change may come-a change toward
inward enlightenment it has come in bela wilson for
instance who is much more clever than all of you put
together

  what has bela wilson to do with this

  i will tell you that too if you cannot see it for your-
self she is a weak girl she has not a mans body nor
a mans strength like the rest of the knabinas who are an
insult to nature yet she has accomplished superhuman
things in these last few days-as you yourself must admit
it was she who saved the life of the clever and strong
superman

  we underestimated her strength and the resistance of
her body

  her body you are wrong put her in the same posi-
tion now make her again climb the wall and suffer the
same strain once more-all by herself she will fail
it was not her body but her soul that accomplished what
was done it was her great overpowering love for you
-for you a blind fool quite unworthy of it it was her
desire to be with you-to save you or else die with you-
which gave her the strength to do what she did and

this is the second great gift which the maker of universes
has bestowed on you

  grando blanco heed my words dont let me talk
in vain-that common fate of prophets you and bela
you two are called upon to show a new example to the
world you must lead humanity out of its hopeless
labyrinth and become the founders of a new race of peo-
ple who shall again acknowledge their own immortality
and send their prayers as of old to the father of us all
grando was looking intently into werners face per-
haps i have been wrong your mind is clear enough
but you live in a different world from mine i shall never
be able to understand you nor can i see why bela
should love me-i have never done anything in particular
for her i have never experienced any similar feeling to-
wards her i will never ridicule you again-for you have
helped me and saved my life but i am just a common
materialistic person

  in my belief my body will be discarded when i die-
just as a piece of broken machinery lets not talk about
it any more i must admit i feel sorry for this misguided
girl really she might have become a very useful kna-
bina you see all that appeals to me is her value as a
machine-which must go along its predetermined course
just as i do but if an axle be bent a machine will not
run straight it is no more use to me

   our thoughts will never meet even if prolonged to in-
finity lets drop the subject if you want to do me a
favor call ben vintros while we have been talking i have
just thought of an improvement for our cutters if we can
only complete our preparations in time a new deluge
will not do us as much damage as it did to our unen-
lightened ancestors i dont want to hurt your feelings-
but please send me sinjoro vintros i am satisfied with
my own ways

   grando laughed i will tell you something else heres
a new view of things i think our earth and for that mat-
ter the whole universe is very much like an old cheese
when it reaches a certain state of decomposition mold
will grow upon it but when it is completely dried out
even the mold dies we are the mold-fungus growth-
the only difference is that we are perhaps a little more
clever and have our flaming ambition to drive us on
we wish to control and master all nature why shouldnt
we if our women are happier without sex why
shouldnt they be that way what if the period of hu-
man life is shortened by a few hundred thousand years-
we are happy in the meantime and we are happy-we
technical materialistic people thats all we care for

  here comes ben vintros sit down ben well talk
about sensible things now see you later professor
dont hold any grudge against me

  werner looked at him soberly there was no contempt
in his glance but pity he was wrong-this grando
blanco he was not happy happy bela wilson
would be happy if this man understood her will gern-
hold would be happy if bela loved him such were the
thoughts of this old man who himself had gone through
life lonely and unloved no happiness can be possible
without love-sacred love

	  

  professor werner was sad in his very heart he had
preached to deaf ears his was the fate of all prophets
yet he was not angry with grando blanco for this young
in the year 



man was the child of a completely materialistic age only
he himself who observed all life from a philosophic point
of view could see how rapidly civilization was heading
towards destruction

  he thought of will gernhold and bela wilson-whose
hearts he had awakened what should become of her
back into the ranks of the knabinas with her broken heart
even revealing her very soul to grando had been useless
or into the villa of some professional father impos-
sible he went over to her bed physically she was al-
most well again but a sad expression remained in her eyes

  an idea has just occurred to me my child as you
know i have some very sick people here who must be taken
care of there will be many more as this insane con-
struction continues will you remain here and help me
care for my patients

  a vague smile glided over her face

  oh may i but i am almost more afraid of people
than i am of their machines

  werner communicated with new york and the super-
visor gave his consent after the professor had expressly
agreed to permanently care for sinjorina wilson why
the supervisor said to himself is there so much fuss over
a silly little knabina

chapter viii

the plot unfolds

	the time was now approaching when the great impact
of meteoric material was expected from all directions
the great stratosphere ships were arriving bearing the
guests of honor from the airport the guests continued
their j ourney to berlin in rocket cars some of the visitors
however wore an anxious look no one could be certain
that the great event would prove a harmless spectacle
in pyrotechnics

  sam bell had not been idle during the past few weeks
with the courage of a fanatic he had burned a great
scar on his left hand thus managing to obtain a months
leave of absence he had not spent this time on the
madeira islands as he pretended but had been very busy
acting as instructor in aviation on the african eoast to
a group of intelligent students

  in an uninhabited section of the sahara desert were
ranged in long rows the airplanes which mosilihortse the
emperor of africa had long ago purchased blit for which
he had until now found no use these preparations had
been noticed by the rest of the world but was considered
perfectly natural was not asia expected to attack any
day now

  what the world did not know was that these planes
were equipped with the latest improvement in artificial
cloud production and were now merely waiting for the
expected hurricanes to waft them over europe by the
time the first visitors were arriving bell had returned
to berlin and once more taken up his duties

  sinjoro nernst was glad to have his reliable assistant
with him during these eventful times during the night
of the th of october a few minor meteoric falls oc-
curred when the meteors reached the electric shell which
surrounded the city of berlin they burst into a thousand
scintillating sparks and vanished this preliminary test
had a quieting effect on the nerves of the visitors they

were housed in the great public caravanserai which had
taken the place of the ancient hotels

  on the th of october the lunar observatory reported
great swarms of meteors sighted calcu-
lations indicate the impact will be felt in
berlin

  the warships of theblacks were waiting close to the
morocco riff where heretofore no cosmic disturbances
had been felt as soon as the destruction of berlin com-
menced sam bell would send into the ether a single
code word-the signal for the great attack

  the th of october fell on a sporto many thousands
of people had come to berlin from paris prague rome
and other cities throughout the german capital the flat
roofs of houses and factories were crowded with sight-
seers citizens took great pride in expressing complete
confidence in sinjoro nernsts barrier ray and the visitors
did not want to appear less courageous than the natives
midnight was not far off to further enhance the splendor
of the approaching spectacle the artificial lights had been
extinguished the firmament stood out clear and deep
over the heads of the assembled crowds-numbering in
the hundreds of thousands

  loudspeakers announced the latest report from the
lunar observatory

 the meteors are coming

  there was feverish excitement

  sinjoro nernst was in the power station he was pale
with emotion but fully confident of his success in an-
other room was sam bell had nernst seen his eyes-
had he read his thoughts on the transmitter-he would
have shuddered bells half-closed eyes were filled with
hatred he was erect and tense and a hard line marked
the corner of his mouth his hand was on a lever

  what are you standing at the engine for

  you can never tell-perhaps the shock might effect
the switch and break the current i think i will stand
here and hold it in place

  sam bell this is the greatest day of our lives to-
day our work will be crowned with success-yours as
well

  yes mine as well

  there was some quality in his assistants hoarse voice
which caused nernst to wince slightly then the loud-
speakers were roaring

 the meteors

  the stars were obscured and the sky darkened then
thousands of small sparks burst into lights-thousands of
shooting stars were racing down followed by an indis-
tinguishable black cloud the phenomenon rapidly ap-
proached the earth the flares and lights were now on a
gigantic scale but in perfect silence then the first of
the falling masses hit the barrier ray and a gigantic
coruscating flame burst into being and the missiles van-
ished in spectacular glory

  nernst like every one else in berlin was looking up-
ward he was absorbed in watching the machinations of
human ingenuity conquer at last this age-old terror of the
universe

  then the silence was rent with horror a hundred thou-
sand voices shrieked as one the crash and rumble of
unimaginable disaster burst on the ears cries and
screams were drowned in the tornado of sound and shock

  then sudden peace once more and the calm spectacle

continued far above at the barrier ray that had been
so admired a fraction qf a second before but that one
second had caused incalculable damage entire streets
had been turned into hopeless ruin thousands of people
lay crushed or buried explosions of spontaneous nature
had added to the damage of the crashing meteors

  confusion reigned supreme thousands ofspectators
leaped from the low roofs many a man who had been
spared by the cosmic holocaust was now trodden under
the panic-stricken feet of his fellow men

  be calm order order the loudspeakers
were howling order

  gradually people regained their reason after all the
barrier ray was once more functioning showers of
meteors were falling up there and being disintegrated harm-
lessly

  please be calm it was nemsts voice over the
loudspeakers there is no longer any danger
a knavish criminal disconnected the cur-
rent for half a second he has been arrest-
ed everything is all right again

  the fires which had broken out here and there through
the city were soon extinguished the construction mater-
ials of the age were almost entirely steel and glass and
fire was seldom an element of danger unfortunately the
industrial section had suffered the most damage

	  

  when the first meteors touched the barrier ray sam
bells motionless hand was still on the lever when the
main mass of the fall came racing blackly down he pulled
the switch the barrier of rays ceased to exist and berlin
was delivered over to destruction then a strange thing
happened grando blanco would have said chance and
professor werner would have exclaimed providence
a piece of meteoric iron struck the flywheel and this
burst a piece of one spoke flew sideways through the
power station neatly amputating the arm of the american
representative on the way and struck heavily against the
generator of the barrier ray the resulting shock startled
sam bell who released the lever almost as soon as he had
pulled it down the lever promptly snapped back into
place and berlin was once more protected

  during this fraction of a second however thousands
had been killed and entire blocks had been laid waste
nernst had not been hit either by the piece of meteoric
matter nor by the fragments of the flywheel he had
stepped back in dismay when the mishap occurred then
he saw his assistant sam bell on the floor the mechanic
was kneeling on his chest

  what on earth let go of sinjoro bell

  he threw the switch to send us all to death

  bell had got to his feet his eyes were bloodshot and
his body trembled his words were almost inarticulate in
his vehement hatred

  yes so i did damn the god who protected you
i wish i had succeeded by now berlin would have been
destroyed but your god has defeated my plan

  nernst could not believe even then he made ralph
schirmer the mechanic repeat what had happened-and
still again

  but the man in the hospital he must have gone in-
sane

  but still he could not believe that this man-to whom
he had given his full confidence-was a criminal

	the fall of meteors was over the first heavy fall was
followed by a few insignificant shooting stars the
lunar observatory sent out confident reports the stars
were shining brightly once more over the city of berlin
in the great government building the representatives of
the blanco states had convened their faces were ser-
ious and determined no representatives were present
from france italy nor south america these sinjoros
were among the victims

  five thousand

  then the ray barrier has not proved successful

  on the contrary it is just this very catastrophe which
testifies its perfection if a criminal 

  now nernst rose from his seat

  was he really a criminal

  the chief of police nodded significantly i have over-
heard his thoughts it was an ingenious plot-nothing
less than the beginning of a war of hatred between the
blacks and the yellows

  just then the australian representative arrived he had
been saved by a lucky coincidence

  i wanted to take the space ship back to canberra he
said but there arent any thousands are waiting

  the german foreign minister rose all space ships
have been commandeered by the united government of
the blancos at this moment thousands of airships of the
nigros are crossing or have already crossed the mediter-
ranean they are invisible behind artificial clouds to-
morrow at daybreak they plan the destruction of the cit-
ies of europe

  the american shook his head that must be a ru-
mor

  no it is a telepathic confession of the man sam
bell it is part of the plot to destroy us all with the al-
most successful destruction of berlin as its prelude
silent horror lay over the assembly they began to-
realize at last the rising problem of the black-yellow
danger suddenly the gray head of professor werner
was visible among them

  they are flourishing races what would the loss of
a hundred thousand men mean to them but woe to the
whites-who are dying out the degradation of your
women shall prove your ruin

  the old man spoke in the voice of a prophet he de-
parted as he had come and no man attempted to detain
him his words left a vague impression of dismay on the
minds of those present for these men had come fresh
from the shattered streets where the dead lay in long
rows waiting burial-where the groans of the maimed and
injured were still to be heard from the hastily extempor-
ized stations

  the blatant loudspeakers broke the silence

 the chinese army stands ready for the
great air attack on africa it is expect-
ed that war will be declared tomorrow
the african space ships are hurriedly re-
turning to africa

  so the danger is over

  it is deferred-but has not ceased to exist

  the tense atmosphere of approaching disaster lay over
the half-destroyed city
in the year 



chapter ix
sam bells punishment

	this materialistic age had one advantage over previous

  areas-there were no criminals courts were no longer
necessary why should there be criminals when the con-
ditions which bred crime no longer existed there was
no love therefore no murders or jealousy there was no
patriotism-therefore no national parties there was no
want of the necessities of life-for as the population de-
creased the wealth of each individual increased the
many farms which lay thickly in the tropical zone santa
machina was one among thousands produced ample food
for everyone

  there was not even a craving for wealth-for what use
would wealth be to people who had no families who had
no mistresses to surround with pomp and luxury or to
place in sumptuous palaces gold had become a mere
medium of exchange in the great battle against the com-
mon enemy of mankind-nature work was considered a
matter of course for the government stores would only
dispense food and clothing in exchange for work per-
formed there were neither charitable institutions nor un-
employment bureaus compassion was extinct in the
world no one cared if one of his neighbors perished

  but work had become easy for it was nothing more
than a mere supervising of the machines such personal
ambition as remained was nothing else than the sport
instinct carried to the extreme-a craving to break a
record the whole world enthusiastically hailed the bold
technician or the daring space navigator or the executor
of fantastic projects six thousand years ago it had
been the same but then the public idols had been boxing
champions the greater part of humanity dozed peace-
fully in the everyday routine of their work they car-
ried out their dull tasks in a daze and accepted their
government rations in the evening their spare time was
spent in recreation but the ambitious ones would spend
long hours over plans thinking up fantastic solutions

  government was concerned with little except the ad-
ministration of the great public enterprises and the run-
ning of the food farms two things came into this world of
sports and machinery which aroused every man and
knabina from lethargy

  the war between the flavo and nigro this war be-
tween two backward peoples who had been laughed at
in seeming superiority and who now suddenly presented
themselves as a very real menace

  then there was the crime of sam bell the nigro who
had shown by his years of devoted work that he was the
mental equal of any white man and who had then almost
destroyed berlin with a single movement of his hand

  a court was hastily formed out of the government rep-
resentatives present they were jurors without a law to
guide them sam bell stood in the prisoners box with a
stubborn spiteful face his body was erect and strong
he did not deny his guilt for he was not even questioned
on his forehead was placed the thought transmitter there
was no use of denying in a world where the mind was not
permitted any privacy

  president linco asked the jury what shall we do with
this man

we ought to execute him but there is no law which

would permit such an action we might keep him in pris-
on-as they used to do in the old days-but why feed him
if he doesnt contribute his share or work then too
he has killed thousands of our friends

  an old man rose from the jury it is beneath our
dignity to take an eye for an eye-a tooth for a tooth it
would be degrading to any white man to have to kill a
black there are no professional executioners i think
we should take him over his own country in an airplane
he can descend to the ground in a parachute and they
may treat him as they wish that would be the best means
of showing them how little we fear their power

  sam bell was accordingly taken into the cabin of an
airplane neither by word or gesture had he betrayed
any emotion after the sentence had been pronounced the
thought transmitter had been removed from his forehead
he sat beside the pilot he could not move without set-
ting up an automatic high-frequency current which would
have killed him instantly

  over the lormer sahara desert-not far from timbuc-
too-the pilot shut off his power

  take the parachute

  with the greatest of pleasure give my sincere thanks
to that foolish president of yours i have a feeling that
we shall see each other once more

  the pilot made no answer sam bell jumped and fell
slowly to earth the airplane turned towards europe

  emperor mosilihortse was again conferring with his
counsellors

  bell has betrayed us he has only served the interests
of the whites he promised to destroy berlin what he
really did was to save it it is easy to see through his
schemes he just wanted to lure our warships across the
mediterranean and there deliver them into the hands of
the whites

  he has not succeeded however we have managed to
get all our airships back to africa before the battle fleet
of the blanco could reach them

  the emperor of africa was not aware of the real value
of the battle fleet he feared there were no warriors left
in europe and the ships were piloted by men who knew
little or nothing of the arts of war mosilihortse sat as
though in deep thought

  i can see only one way out the asiatic attack may
begin any day now i shall get in touch with the emperor
of asia-offer him an alliance-and suggest a united at-
tack upon the white race they will not expect it now
and the chinese are even better prepared for war than we
a united attack on the whites i think it will appeal to
them yet the flavo must not be the victors

  a malicious smile played about his lips the whites
are their superiors our own fleet will let them have the
honor of the attack from the rear we can easily parti-
cipate in the victory if there is one or return first in case
of defeat

  the door of the room swung open and sam bell entered

  here i am i managed to   

  rage distorted the emperors features

  yes here you are i can see here you are you
traitor and you dare   

 i	

  frightened by the emperors menacing attitude bell
reached into his coat for a weapon

  have you forgotten what i told you -here take

this and mosilihortse sank his ready kniie into sam
bells breast bell fell on the floor his lips were
distorted in a wild grin now he gasped you have
murdered the only man who could have saved you
get that traitor out of my sight

  the murderer had been spared by the whites only to
receive his punishment at the hands of his own master

  then the emperor called his secretary to dictate the
letter to the ruler pf asia two hours later an airship
was carrying it to its destination across the seas

	not far from berlin a huge funeral pyre was blazing

  the crematories were entirely inadequate to take care
of the dead it was a mass funeral yet without tears
who would mourn there were no loved ones to be
left behind it was conducted like any other business-
like task there were no obituaries and no prayers
the disaster merely meant more room for those who had
survived

	  

  ben vintros had become grando blancos right hand
ben was an exception to the general rule he showed
some affection toward his sister who had been with him
on the moon he had requested that she be transferred
to the brocken observatory she was now pacing the
rooms in the observatory in her usual masculine manner
discharging her duties she was accompanied by ellen
mors another knabina

	  

  grando blanco had had to remain another few days in
the professors cave to complete the healing of his in-
jured foot werner had seized many an opportunity
not to again speak to grando about his ideas but to ob-
serve him he admired greatly this mans clear hand
boundless energy and iron will but he also observed
will gernhold lost in sorrowful dreams of his hopeless
love for bela

  again and again he had tried to woo her and became
so obsessed that he was of little use nowadays as a doc-
tors assistant werner would shake his head in grief
why had all his hopes been shattered the more he ob-
served will the more he realized that he was nothing but
a well-intentioned weakling he was a man without real
force or strength of mind he would never have been a
proper founder of a new race

  but grando blanco why was blanco only strength
and will and gernhold only heart why had not will
been endowed with the engineers iron constitution and
able brain or why was grando not given wills under-
standing heart

  between the two stood bela wilson sad and despair-
ing the one great hour fate had given her had passed
and she had lost now grando scarcely noticed her
when she came into his room to bring him food and re-
freshing drinks she was nothing more to him than any
knabina servant and will she was deaf to his vio-
lent exhortations she spoke to him but something
within her courageous soul held his effeminate appearance
in contempt she would accept the books he presented
her but even books now failed to make her happy what
use was it to read in the pages of the past of a happiness
lost to her forever she received some consolation read-
ing about the belief of the ancients in an all-wise god-
who controlled and directed human fate she would have

eagerly become a believer herself-if only she could know
and understand something about it all

  the professor would sit for days and days in the most
secluded of his studies an idea had taken possession of
him it was eating its way into his soul

  grandos brain wills heart oh to be more than
just a weak mortal wills heart grandos brain if
one only could exchange these two

	hang cho fu emperor of asia who had been called the
new ghengis khan was sitting in his palace talking to
his minister of war the genial tschun lo fen neither in
person nor in his surroundings did he resemble his ancient
namesake he had removed the capital of china to can-
ton where he was in a more central location to administer
his new overlordship of all asia japan was now only a
subordinate province the last vestiges of english rule
had been stamped out of india

  canton was a city of six million inhabitants and in no
way resembled its earlier existence even the government
palace on the low hill was plain and utilitarian in appear-
ance the rest of the city below stretched out in uniform
buildings of steel and glass there was no romantic at-
mosphere remaining from the past centuries

  hang cho fu was about fifty years of age and dressed
entirely in the european fashion only the occasional
treacherous look in his slanting eyes and the prominence of
his cheek bones betrayed the cruel asiatic it took a man
of his nature to become master of japan-even though this
unfortunate country had been much weakened by earth-
quakes and natural catastrophes

  tschun lo fen i have received a very strange letter
it has given me a great deal to think about and perhaps
may change all our strategic plans

  too bad the entire air fleet is ready to start i
thought of taking advantage of the east hurricanes to reach
timbuctoo in quick order and destroy the heart of the
black empire

  read the letter

  the minister took from his masters hand a voluminous
document written in esperanto

  arent we fools to try and destroy each other he read

  the minister looked up

  tomorrow mosilihortse the last will no longer be in a
position to call us fools

  go on reading

  are we really enemies arent we really natural al-
lies against a common enemy-the white race they have
been so arrogant as to regard the entire world as their
property they came from the tiny continent of europe
and proceeded to rob and murder at large to whom be-
longed america was it not once the land of the red-
skins now long extinct they dragged away thousands
and millions of our black brethren as slaves these slaves
have been free for many hundreds of years but still the
whites look down upon them as their inferiors

  what have they done to asia for centuries they as-
sumed rulership of great areas but what is this white
man-merely a degenerate human calling himself a god
but to us-the blacks and the yellows-belongs the future
we are the youth of the world the blancos are the
ancients why should we fight each other rather let
us go together against the arch enemy and occupy the
thrones which they have prepared for us
in the year 



  what good will it do if your airships cover africa
with poison gas she is one of the great centers of grain
production her entire vegetation will die out under the
gas from which it is true we cannot defend ourselves
the entire fertile land will be laid waste to whose ad-
vantage certainly not chinas

  on the other hand what is europe it is so to speak
one huge factory if our combined fleets in a few hours
fill her atmosphere with poison the white race will perish
but the machines will remain as they are asia has its
thousand million inhabitants-africa a quarter of that in
all europe and america are four hundred millions what
difference if all the whites were destroyed asia has enough
people to repopulate it if we work together we will
rule it together

  after all where is the harm in killing a quarter billion
white men in the course of thousands of years have they
been careful of the lives of others when they conquered
america they slaughtered the inhabitants-the same in
australia you know what the white race has on the debit
side of its account let us unite our forces for the destruc-
tion of europe the remaining whites--in
america could not harm us-us the world dominant yel-
low-black empire never has there been such an oppor-
tune moment they suppose us engaged in an internecine
struggle your fleets can come to africa and ours make
every preparation-all without any suspicion once we are
assembled one nights journey brings us to europe our
first attack will destroy berlin and paris simultaneously
your gas is so effective that in matter of hours it will
cover thousands of square miles with a thick lethal fog
nothing can live in eight days there should be no more
europe

  in a few weeks our armies would have invaded the dead
continent they would not be warriors but engineers and
technicians they would take possession of the deserted
factories overnight the industry of the entire world would
be in our hands not for nothing have we sat at the feet
of the whites for thousands of years in seeming subordina-
tion judge for yourself my imperial brother of asia
whether it is right to destroy each other so that the white
may laugh at us is it not better to set forth side by side
to the conquest of these arrogant superior blancos

  tschun lo fen finished reading the letter

  it is a great idea when europe is ours it will not be
difficult to get a few hundred million of our people over
there within a few months it will be easy after that to
turn our attention to africa 

  the emperor jumped to his feet we would be the
lords of three continents the fourth australia would fall
an easy prey

  how about america

  hang cho fu laughed america the proud yankees
who claim to be the smartest people on the face of the
earth if that be so they will make clever slaves they
will cringe and bow and work for us and suffer as the
world has worked and suffered in the past under their whip
we will not kill them-not by any means

  their european clothes and modem surroundings con-
trasted strangely with their words-these two orientals

who had unconsciously betrayed their racial heritage the
blood-thirst of the great khan to destroy europe to
extinguish all life in one glorious holocaust the em-
peror visualized the scene as though he were already in
berlin the immense armies of coolies were directed
by his yellow engineers who had so eagerly learned their
technic from the whites

  your excellency take a rocket plaee and go to tim-
buctoo today to make the contract definite make em-
peror mosilihortse believe in our friendship  in the
meantime i will temporarily disband the arm the sol-
diers may return to their fields in the new army every
officer will be an engineer the generals will be factory
managers and the scientists will be field marshals we
will show the world that we were intelligent pupils

  the next day minister tschun lo fen had arrived in
timbuctoo this city had changed very much from the
old days of the slave trade it was a city of some six
million inhabitants and had been built according to mod-
ern ideas it was situated on the shore of a great lake
this change had come about within the last two thousand
years when the huge task of thoroughly irrigating the
sahara with water pumped from the ever-running streams
deep in the subsoil had been completed now a huge
level plain covered with vegetation and dotted with fresh-
water lakes extended from the atlas mountains down to
the territory of the niger river lush fields lay on the
site where centuries before dusty caravans had died of
thirst

  timbuctoo looked entirely different however from the
sober materialistic city of canton the soul of the nigro
still loved elaborate display and lively colors the palace
of emperor mosilihortse was built on a hill it was a
gigantic golden mosque glittering in the sunlight it
was guarded by troops in colorful uniforms it was run
with a pomp which the rest of the world had long con-
sidered childish nonsense the interior was decorated
with the utmost luxury and the harem was populated
by hundreds of women from all parts of the world the
emperor of the blacks was the fast ruler in the true
oriental manner remaining on earth

  and still africa must not be thought entirely behind
the times universities and technical schools were to be
found all over the continent the quick intelligence of
the blacks had brought them far since the day they walked
naked through the jungle they had developed into a
haughty race with a strong sense of their own importance
their cultural level was closely akin to that of the roman
empire shortly before its fall

  tschun lo fen was received with elaborate pomp and
led into the imperial palace his mocking smile caused no
suspicion as he stood in seeming reverence before emperor
mosilihortse and offered in behalf of his master the con-
sent of asia to the great coalition the plane which had
brought him was small and inconspicuous and had travel-
led secretly at night for this journey and its purpose had
to be carefully concealed from the whites it was for-
tunate for this africo-asiatic conspiracy that thought re-
ceivers were not of sufficient range to enable the govern-
ment eavesdroppers to read the thoughts of these men in
the palace in timbuctoo

happening for these ignorant savages the gholpos re-
garded it as a manifestation of some divine or demoniac
power in league with the psounas and were henceforward
altogether broken and cowed

  the psounas it sfeems were prone even from the first
to a more naturalistic supposition regarding the character
and origin of the time-sphere their long familiarity with
the strange ultra-stellar robot may have helped to dis-
abuse them of any belief in the supernaturalism of mere
machinery i have had no difficulty in explaining to them
the mechanism of our vessel and the voyage we have made
along the aeons

  my efforts however to tell them something of my own
world of its peoples and customs have so far met with
polite incredulity or sheer incomprehension such a world
they say is quite unheard-of and if they were not so
courteous probably they would tell me that it could not
even be imagined by any rational being

  li wong and i as well as the psounas have learned
to talk with the singular entity whom i rescued  from the
diabolic living flowers on a world midway between the
earth and mohaun los this person calls himself tuo-
quan and he is a most erudite savant his ideas and
discoveries being somewhat at variance with the notions
that prevail in his own world had caused him to be re-
garded with suspicion and hatred by his fellows and
as i surmised he had beenabandoned by them after due
process of law to a cruel doom in the jungle

  the time-machine in which they had followed us to
mohaun los was he believed the only vessel of the kind
that had so far been invented by this people their zeal-
ous and fanatiw devotion to legality and law-enforcement
would have led them to pursue us beyond the boundaries
of the universal continuum fortunately there was small
likelihood that they would ever dispatch another time-
machine on our trail for the lingering etheric vibrations
that had enabled them to follow us as dogs follow the
scent of their quarry would die out long before they
could construct a duplicate of the unreturning polyhe-
dron

  with the aid of the psounas who have supplied me
with the necessary metallic elements i have repaired the
broken connection in the time-sphere i have also made
a miniature duplicate of the mechanism in which i am
planning to enclose this letter and send it backward
through time in the seemingly far-fetched and fantastic
hope that it may somehow reach the earth and be received
by you

  the astronomers of the psounas have helped me to make
the needful computations and adjustments which indeed

editors note granting the truth of domitian mal-
graffs narrative and admitting that his letter was launch-
ed from a world in future time there are still certain
problems that baffle explanation no one knows how
long the mechanism containing the letter had been float-
ing in the banda sea before it was picked up but in order

the

would be utterly beyond my own skill or the mathema-
tical knowledge of any human being by combining in
these calculations the chronometric records of the dials
in the time-sphere with the ephemerides of mohaun los
during the past seven months and allowing for the pauses
and changes of speed which we made during our journey
it has been possible to chart the incredibly complicated
course which the mechanism must follow in time and
space

   if the calculations are correct to the most infinitesimal
degree and the movement of the device is perfectly syn-
chronized the thing will stop at the very moment and in
the very same place from which i left the earth in re-
trograde time but of course it will be a miracle if it
reaches the earth at all the psounas have pointed out
to me a ninth-magnitude star which they think is the solar
orb of the system in which i was born

   if theietter should ever reach you i have no reason to
think that you will believe my tale

   nevertheless i am going to ask you to publish it even
though the world in general will regard it as the fantasy
of a madman or a practical joker it pleases an obscure
sense of irony in my mental makeup to know that the
truth will be heard by those among whom it must pass for
a fantastic lie such an eventuation perhaps will be far
from novel or unprecedented

  as i have said before i am well enough contented with
life in mohaun los even death i am told is a pleasant
thing in this world for when the psounas wax old and
weary they repair to a hidden valley in which they are
overcome by the lethal and voluptuous perfume of nar-
cotic flowers

  however it may be that the nostalgia of new ages and
new planets will seize me anon and i shall feel impelled
to continue my journey among future cycles li wong
it goes without saying will accompany me in any such
venture though he is quite happily engaged at present in
translating the odes of confucius and other chinese clas-
sics for the benefit of the people of mohaun los this
poetry i might add is meeting with a better reception
than my tales regarding occidental civilization

   tuoquan who is teaching the psounas to piake the fear-
fully destructive weapons of his own world may decide to
go with us for he is full of intellectual curiosities per-
haps we shall follow the great circle of time till the years
and aons without number have returned upon themselves
once more and the past is made a sequel to the future

to reach the earth at all in the unimaginably complicated
maze of temporal and spatial movement it must have
fallen there not long after the departure of the time-ma-

the platinum planets

   continued from page 

  incapable of coherent thought he bent down to exam-
ine his victim he fumbled for his torch the better to see
the man then with a hoarse scream he fled from the
room for there lying in a pool of blood was his adored
kid brother bunch

	what happened after jackthorpe could never remember

  he had visions of white pillows and black deeds of
days of torture and nights of terror when finally he
came to himself he was in a nursing home he lost no
time in leaving and made straight for home slinking in by
a side door he wanted to hide to hide through the
long corridor he crept and into the library

  there in the corner by the stained glass window were
the eerie platinum planets presided over by the gilded
figure of ignace pascal the wretched man cringed from
them but he felt impelled to look straight at them for
a moment he blinked then fell into a chair there in the
center of the group the grinning dervish intent upon his
devil play stood sinister and exulting the ninth piece
slaughter was in place

  a ticket hung from the statuette weakly the broken
man moved towards the piece and examined the tag it
was in bunchs handwriting and said simply

  who says its not a kids game

  jack slumped to the floor it was all clear now an-
noyed that he would not take him bunch had secured the
asteroid fitted her with robots and somehow managed to
raise pascals liner and secure the treasure he wouldnt
sell naturally so that he could bring off this coup ob-
viously when jack had thought namur was robbing the
mail-ship bunch was merely handing over the statuette
so that it would be delivered early

  and now it was all over the old superstition was only
too true the platinum planets had claimed their victim

	  

  bouncing baboons jack youve led us a nice dance
what the devil do you mean skipping out of the nursing
home like that

  jackthorpe looked round with a strange fear in his
eyes for it was the voice of bunch

  its all right old bean cried bunch as he noted his
brothers horror-stricken face its not the giddy old
ghost come clanking his chains im  

the

   youre alive said jack slowly and incredulously
   yes

   then i    dreamed    it    all

  oh no you didnt that token of brotherly love
was real enough but you see youre a rotten shot
you hit me on the shoulder instead of the bean and
knocked me down hit my nose on something and bled
like a bullock must have fainted when i came too
found you in a high fever telling the world youd mur-
dered me

   but how did you raise the liner with nothing to help
but robots and why the devil did you impersonate
namur

  bunch laughed uproariously

  those werent robots you see when you turned me
down i stated my case to our university science club
my fellow students who are always ready to give super-
stition the ko in the interests of science said they were
ready to man the asteroid and beat you to it we
adopted the namur stunt to frighten you off but when
you continued to follow us you old warrior you put us
in a stew you see we hadnt a decent space engineer
aboard and we developed engine trouble

  we kept speeding along for a while and then slow-
ing up the only chance was to catch the mail-ship and
hand over the treasure we just managed it as you
know and then broke down again

  when you showed us you were coming aboard we
thought the best way to keep up the joke was to imper-
sonate robots i nearly died of laughing behind that
curtain that is until you socked me

   but jack was still dazed he felt bunch all over to
make sure he wasnt dreaming finally he said slowly
then the superstition didnt work after all

  they never do said bunch positively we live in
an age of science not cobwebby jujus besides ive
been looking up the giddy old legend and i find it says
nothing about murder it says blood will be spilled
and lord knows my beak bled a bucketful

  and with a total lack of reverence bunch proceeded
to strike a lucifer on the posterior portion of the grin-
ning dervishs anatomy

  guess this guy he murmured whimsically was just
cut out for this job

earths new neighbors

for many years it was supposed that all the asteroids or miniattire planets were between the orbits of
mars and jupiter where seemingly nature had provided a path for one large planet of late years the
rule was upset when it was found that the little planetoid eros comes nearly three times as close to us as
mars does and that a large number of asteroids called the trojans are revolving practically in the orbit
of jupiter although keeping several hundred millions miles from him

now there have been discovered other tiny heavenly bodies probably not more than a couple of miles in
diameter coming within a few million miles of us and actually crossing inside the earths orbit so close
were they when found that it seemed almost possible they might be satellites of ours the new discov-
eries of interest to all interplanetary enthusiasts and their possibilities will be discussed by a distinguished
astronomical authority dr donald h menzel in the august issue of

everyday science and mechanics

now on the newsstands
science questions
and answers

 this department is conducted for the benefit of readers who have
pertinent queries on modern scientific facts as space is limited we can-
not undertake to answer more than three questions for each letter

the flood of correspondence received makes it- impractical also to print
answers as soon as w-e receive questions however questions of gen-
eral interest will receive careful attention

a difference of two thousand miles
an hour

 editor science questions  and answers

   by reading an article on the einstein theory
 i gather that one of its propositions states some
 thing to this effect

   two observers a and b are on the earths
 equator and on opposite sides of the earth from
 one another

   a is observing the sunrise

   b is observing the sunset

a with the aid of precision instruments
measures the velocity of light as it passes him

   b does likewise

   later a and b compare figures and find them
 identical

  now according to my reasoning there
should have been a difference of about 
miles per hour  please explain

 l morse

                  san bruno calif

  if we are to believe einstein both men
will find the velocity of light to be the same
even though one is moving toward the light
rays and the other away from them for
einsteins theory of relativity is based upon
the constancy of the velocity of the light in-
dependent of the motion of the observer

   the explanation for this apparent contradic-
 tion einstein makes by stating that the pre
 cision instruments of the two men were really
 not reading alike that as they moved with
 reference to the source of the light the sun
 one man moved away from it and another
 toward it their recording instruments chang-
 ed or let us say that the two men mrere
 moving with reference to each other one man
 was moving east at  miles an hour and
 the other west at the same speed therefore
 they had a speed relative to each other of 
 miles an hour

  now each man can consider according to
einstein that he is at rest and the other
observer is moving at  miles an hour each
will find that the clock of the other man will
be slowed up and his measuring instruments
will be shortened so that the two men are not
really using identical instruments therefore
when one man says that the light moves past
him at  miles a second his yardstick
by which he measures miles and his clock by
which he measures seconds are different from
that of the other man

  if the motion of the earth were suddenly
to stop so that the two men were at rest with
reference to each other then their measuring
instruments would again become similar

  the amount of the contraction of the yard-
sticks and the amount of the slowing of the
clocks are determined by the fitzgerald con-
traction equation which has been printed a
number of times in these columns

  the difficulty that the average man has in
understanding einstein is a difficulty in pic-
turing the change in yardstick and clock es-
pecially when einstein permits each observer to
feel that his instruments are right and only
the other observers are wrong but einstein
appears to be accepted by most of the authori-
tative physicists and mathematicians-editor

water in a space ship

editor science questions and answers

  suppose in a space ship having reached a
point where gravity is nullified where no ar-
tificial gravity is inside a tumbler of a liquid
were npset would the liquid floating in the
air in the vessel form a sphere if not
what other shape would it take or is this
unanswerable till one has gone and found
out i

                 b s murton

                 london s w  england

   if the apace ship were far enough away from
 any heavenly body so that any external grav-
 itational force acting on it were practically
 zero then the water would fall into globules

   water possesses what is called surface ten-

 sion a tendency of the outer molecules of the
 water surface to form a thin film this can
 be observed by very gently lowering a small
 needle into a glass of water if it is done
 carefully enough the surface tension of the
 water will support the needle although the
 needle is really too dense to float

similarly if water be released in a field of
no gravitation assuming the gravitation ex-
erted by the ship itself to be practically nil
then the surface tension will form the drops into
globules of smaller or larger sizes to float
about the room if they struck a wall each
sphere would probably break into smaller
spheres but the globular shape would be main-
tained

it can be easily understood that when surface
tension acts upon a liquid it naturally molds
it into a spherical shape-editor

an arrows spin

editor science questions and answers

    an arrow revolves in a circle and during its
revolution always points t-oward the center of
the circle it makes while another arrow also

really spins the second one rotates around
its axis and by definition therefore it does
not spin the arrow that always points toward
the centers of its circle of rotation therefore
is the one possessing the spin

  therefore the earth in turning continually
on its axis spins but the earth in circling the
sun even though its axis remains parallel to
itself and tangent to its orbit does not spin-

a beam of light

 editor science questions and answers

   does a beam of light cease to exist when the
 source is extinguished or does it continue to
 travel until intercepted

                  j s hoerl

                  san fntnciseo cal

  we must first understand what we mean by
a beam of light a body heated to incan-
descence emits waves of electromagnetic energy
such bodies are stars like our sun incan-
descent lamps flashlight filaments etc some
of these waves strike our senses as heat and

showing the different
effects of air and a
vacuum on light in
the upper picture the
rays of the flashlight
are reflected by dust
and moisture in the
air in the vacuum
chamber the rays are
unseen until they
strike a solid object

which of the two arrows spin

    the actions of the two arrows are funda-
mentally different the first one really rotates
on its axis and by the definition of spin it

readers

     if you like science ques-
   tions and answers in this
   magazine you will find in our
   sister magazine everyday
   science and mechanics a simi-
   lar department greatly expanded
   called the oracle look for
   it you science fans

 others of a limited range of frequency strike
 our eyes with a perception of light in other
 words they illuminate the object that emits
 them we see objects either because they
 emit light themselves or because light waves
 are  reflected from them to our eyes

  thus the beam of light that we see emitted
from a flashlight is reflected to us by the dust
and water particles in their path if the flash-
light were turned on in a vacuum we would
see no beam but only the splash of light when
the light waves struck a wall or some mater-
ial body and were reflected back to our eyes

  now a light wave emitted from the sun was
understood to travel theoretically on and on
through space until it hit some body from
which it was reflected or within which
it was absorbed if it struck no body that
detracted it from its path it would have gone
on forever stirring up the ether

   as a matter of fact it is believed now that
 as it goes on it loses energy just as a water
 wave gradually loses its energy and disap-
 pears the light wave would weaken its fre-
 quency would become smaller its wavelength
 longer and if enough of its energy were lost
 it would no longer strike the eye as light but
 as heat waves or waves of the frequency of
 radio waves naturally then the extinguish-
 ing of the source of the light will have no
 effect on light waves already emitted but
 there will be no further emission-editor

lord rutherford does it

editor wonder stories t

 i have been a subscriber for one year and
i feel certain you will appreciate that the high-
est proof a reader can pay his editor is to re
new hib subscription for two years the rea-
son is that you give me stories that  like and
a magazine that i look forward to receiving
each month

  naturally i do come across a story now and
then that personally i do not like but those
are very few stories of the future are my
favorites good time stories and interplanetary
tales

  the time stream was excellent and mr
tain is to be congratulated for producing what
must surely rank as a classic in science ac-
tion the pinal war was another very ex-
cellent story what a fine food for reading
for members of the disarmament conference

  i must not forget mr miller whose stories i
have enjoyed and i look forward to more of
these also to clark ashton smith for hib ex-
cellent style his perfect english it is al-
ways a pleasure to take up wonder stories
and read one of his tales

  i was pleased to see miss stone in the
june issue and i hope to see more of her
work in the future she is an authoress of
great talent and her stories ure always first
class

  before classing stories and authors i would
like to record my appreciation of mr starzls
work especially those which deal with his fa-
mous i p p i am only sorry that i may
never live to actually see them in action for i
am of the opinion that nothing is impossible
in science and i feel that any day those thrill-
ing interplanetary wars will be cnacted in life
it is in that spirit with which i read wonder
stories

  now for the scoffers i how many of the
authors have made use of atomic guns etc
most of them one time or another and yet
many people look upon atomic power as a bit
of literary imagination even some of our own
readers i am afraid

  last week lord rutherford who broke the
nitrogen atoms in  announced that his
experiment in splitting the atom was success-
ful so far few details are at hand the
news first came through the radio 
volts were used apparently a considerable
amount of energy was used before a square hit
was made also it was recorded that trans-
mutation of matter occurred

  the only comment lord rutherford made
was that so far lie could not say at this stage
whether the experiment would be of any com-
mercial use and the research would be con-
tinued the experiment was carried out at the
cambridge laboratory and to put the timid at
ease-there was no damage

  still the first step the atom is split at last
and now may we hope space ships are not too
far distant and perhaps may one day appear

london s w  england

  yes the first step has been made and
what its final conclusions may be no one can
gueas the vast future predicted by our au-
thors is gradually opening it makes gne dizzy
to dwell upon it-editor

c a smith on garbage-mongering

editor wonder stories

    i should like to say a few words anent one
or two points which p schuyler miller raises
in his interesting letter in the june wonder
stories

    personally i cannot see that science fiction
is as he puts it unfortunately limited in its
range of expression at least i do not think
that a type of literature so avowedly imagina-
tive would benefit materially by invading as so
much modern fiction has done the field of clini-
cal analysis and sex-physiology that sort of
thing has been done ad infinitum and and ad
nauaeum by non-imaginative writers such as
are favored by the professional intelligentsia
of our sex-demented republic and one of the
most refreshing things about science fiction and
fantastic fiction in general is the avoidance of
such tritenesses

    to me the best if not the only function of
imaginative writing is to lead the human
imagination outward to take it into the vast
external cosmos and away from all that in-
troversion and introspection that morbidly ex-
aggerated prying into ones own vitals-and
the vitals of others-which robinson jeffers
has so aptly symbolized as incest what we
need is less human interest in the narrow
sense of that term-not more physiological-
and even psychological analysis-can be large-
ly left to the writers of scicntific monographs on
such themes fiction as i see it is not the
place for that sort of grubbing

    certainly i do not think that h g wells in
the tedious analytic novels of his later phase
would be a good model for an imaginative writ
er wells in his earlier years wrote some mar-
velous fantasies but afterwards he was more
and more seduced into sociology psychoanalysis
etc etc till his stories became a truly awful
example of everything that fiction should not be
no doubt they are excellest treatises but as tales
they are simply unreadable

    what science fiction chiefly needs i should
say is a rigorous raising of literary standards
an insistence on good english as opposed to
the jargon of magazine hackwriting form and
finish are all too often lacking in stories other-
wise excellent

    as to gaining the recognition of the high-
brows-well i hope that science fiction will
never gain it if the winning of this guerdon
must involve an emulation of the squalors and
tediosities the highbrow pornography and gen-
eral garbage-mongering of the current school
of realistic novelists

ro the celebrated strictures of one mr
schwartz it appears to me that they hardly

on letters

   decause of the large number of let
   ters we receive we find it physi-
   cally impossible to print them all in
   full may we request our correspond
   ents therefore to make their letters
   as brief and to the point as they can
   as this will aid in- their selection for
   publication whenever possible we will
   print the letter in full but in some cases
   when lack of space prohibits publishing
   the complete letter we will give a resume
   of it in a single paragraph

need refuting since they are patently ridicu
lous slack-mouthed youths and mental sub-
normals in general are not likely to be inter-
ested in either science or imagination such as
is purveyed by wonder stories and other
magazines of the same type

                 clark ashton smith

                 auburn cal

   clark ashton smith throws a refreshing note
into the controversy-science fiction and its fu
ture mr smith himself is a model for what
he wants from science fiction for in all of his
stories we get the tremendous thrill of escape
from our petty little world into the vastnesa
of unknown universes

   we would be glad to get comments from other
of our readers who agree or disagree with mr
smith and his viewpoint-editor

in defense of francis flagg

editor wonder stories

   i dont usually write letters to your maga-
zine though i generally read it with interest
letter column and all i was surprised and
somewhat amused to read mr kentona i
think it is mr kenton a friend borrowed my
magazine and i cant be certain of the name
letter re the merit of your various authors it
was i think utterly uncalled for for mr ken-
ton to dismiss any author as a disgrace to the
writing profession

  does mr kenton realize that one of the
authors he dismisses bo sophormorically-
francis flagg--has had a story win honor-
able mention by the o henry award the
ladies and gentlemen comprising the o henry
award committee happen to be quite prominent
short story critics and i am sure would not
give a story honorable mention unless it had
some merit some claim to ha well-written as
a skilful writer of stories in science and weird
tfiction francis flagg is certainly no disgrace

 might ask how many of mr flaggs stories
mr kenton has read and i might-but 
dont wish to be catty-inquire of mr kenton
if he senses the wealth of wide reading and
scientific knowledge which is implied in the
writing of such stories as the machine man
of ardathia the blue dimension the
land of the bipos the dancer in the crys-
tal and the picture

   mr kenton does do one good thing he has
wit enough to rank mr smith very high the-
best science fiction authors i have read in
wonder stories to dato have been flagg
smith breuer starzl hilliard i dont main-
tain these authors are the best i merely
state they have struck my fancy but indeed
why be arbitrary hardly aa author that has
written for wonder stories but what has in-
terested me in some fashion flagg for his
realism erudition technique smith for magi-
cal spinning of glamorous words and for the
uniqueness and strangeness of his yarns repp
for cleverness and pace of his plots though he
is not the equal of the others in handling words
and starzl for the flow and swing of the action
in his stories

   to close i admit my lavorites are smith
flagg starzl etc but i dont imply by that
that all other authors are disgraces to the writ-
ing profession that they cant write or that
their stories are uninteresting please mr
kenton dont be too absurd

triple-cursed trash

editor wonder stories 

  every time you print for your readers a
story written by a foreign author you free the
readers from the unending parade of offspring
of a fear-instilling entity    namely the
american authors    and their stories each
month almost without fail we are greeted
by a story at least one that is a complete
flop the story may be written by one of
americas greatest authors  by an author
whose work is praised high and low    but
we all know from reading science fiction that
all authors have their bad points    that at
times they write stories that hold us spellbound
   perfect stories    and at other times these
same authors dish out page after page of
triple-cursed trash

  but  it seems that every story written
by a foreigner imported stories keeps our
eyes riveted to the page to the very finish ia
it because we read so little fiction written by
these versatile europeans or are every one
of their stories  perfect after reading
cosmic cloud stone from the moon shot
into infinity plight of the aerofix in
the year  etc i feel as though id give
anything to read a german or french science
fiction magazine well how about it mr
editor what is it that makes these foreign-
ers outshine our writers i believe that they
do

  i believe that the most amazing story ever
written will be one that will take up three is-
sues in serial form and in its theme be a story
that does nothing else but explain the world of
a thousand years future i do not mean a time
traveling story i rave and tear my hair
wtien one of those things come along i mean
a history-book of the future something like
stapledons last and first men except that
it should not tell about the very far far distant
future imagine a story taking one part de-
scribing the people of the future another part
describing business buildings and living con
ditions and the third tellng about governments
warfare etc im waiting for such a tale
will some author kindly oblige

  science fiction has evolved so to speak
remember back in the dim dark ages of the
beginning of science fiction  the first stories
written told about starts of space flights trips
to the moon mars and other planets describ-
ing the flights as they progressed telling of the
hardships and sicknesses of the passengers on
their first flights    but now i i  what do
we have  by this tiine all space flying is
perfocted to the nth degree in one paragraph
our hero steps into his space rocket pulls the
atomic disintegration over and the next para-
graph shows the same boy landing on pluto or
some other celestial body floating at an unheard
of distance from the earth well what causes
that are the authors getting tired i sug-
gest a long rest for our present authors giving
some newcomers a chance

  our policy in publishing occasional for-
eign stories is not to belittle american au-
thors but to vary the national diet it is true
that authors of any nation tend to have a same-
ness about their approach their style nd ma-
terial frenchmen englishmen and germans
think differently and write differently than we
do and their stories consequently have a fresh-
ness about them that is stimulating to the ap-
petite

  if there is anything about american writers
that the editors dislike it is their tendency a

holdover from the movies of ten years ago to
introduce into every story a handsome six-foot
hero a leering villian and a beauteous sweet
and innocent heroine and this eternal tri-
angle works itself out to the last inch by the
old formula-editor

  the final war must it come

   i didnt want to write again so soon but
 i mustl i mustl the reason is the final
 war by herr spohr i got the march and
 april issues on the same day and in the after-
 noon i started reading the first half in the
 evening the second half when i finished it
 was  oclock in the morning and afterwards
 i couldnt sleep its a devilish story

   unnecessary to say its the best of all the
 war stories j understand or can read six
 languages i ever read unnecessary to say
 that one can see or feel after the first three
 pages that it has been written by a man who
 saw the hell of the great war

   my thoughts the whole night were is there
 any mistake in the story  is there a mistake
 in the science or in the technical descriptions
 of the story nol is there a mistake in the
 description of military and strategic things
 noe is there a mistake in the idea must
 the final war come must mankind wipe it
 self out i heard from a friend here the in-
 ventor of a propeller-railway the power of
 human weapons and the present standard of
 ethics morals and clearness of mind is like
 giving babes some matches razor blades and
 gasoline to play with

 book was forbidden to be printed in russia
 and was printed in another european country
 without his name stated that wars must al-
 ways be longer heavier and bloodier and that
 they will end not with a glorious victory of
 one of the fighting nations but by social revo-
 lution of all the nations who make war the
 great war showed that the russian professor
 was right is herr spohr right too and must
 the final war come

   the author tells us himself about psycho
 logical reasons he says the balance
 power    some more war machinery here   
 some more war machinery there    those nit-
 wits who are in love with their guns    if
 one gun goes they all go   the stone be-
 gins rolling the final war begins

   in the end of the middle ages in a book
 called epitome re militaris the phrase was
 llirst printed si vis pacem para bettum if
 you want peace be ready for war events
 have shown us that it is the greatest nonsense
 in the world the states with a practically and
  relatively little army have had no wars for a
 long time switzerland holland the scandina-
 vian countries etc power has its best bal-
 ance if there is no power on either side i
 speak only of military power if there is pow-
 er on one side men will always like to show
 the others their own i have more

   secondly spohr says the men who make
 terms dont feci the effect of their weapons
 maybe some new inventions like air raids by
 rockets spreading death over a whole country
 will make this biggest danger smaller maybe
 the conference on disarmament will help a lit-
 tle

   but the most important thing-who has the
 benefit of a war the generals not always
 it may happen that the war ends in a revolution
 and they may feel their machine guns on their
 own bodies but in every case the owners of
 factories of guns and ammunition have a bene-
 fit

   that is the most important point it is said
 the youth are feeling better than the old men
 remember the council of four in the final
 war i believe it but there are sadistic-
 patriotic types of gun-lovers among the youths
 but the youth of each generation can do one
 thing i said war means big business for some
 men well make an economic situation that
 war will mean bad business in europe it can
 be so then the crisis will be over

that is the reason i have for hoping that
the final war will never come and if men
of one nation learn and see enough of other

wonder stories for august 

the reader speaks

continued from page 

nations they will lose the idea of war against
a nation in whom they have friends

  it is a theme for long discussion and it is
impossible to say much here but there is a
hope 

  some of the other stories such as the reign
of the star death th century revolt were
excellent the last woman and red april
 were also -very good but they did not
give so much to think about as the iinal war
willy ley

                 berlin germany

  herr ley states a fact that americans should
well appreciate although abstractly the thought
of going to war with england france or ger
many might not be repulsive to us yet were we
to realize that to do so might be to kill our
friends in those countries we would be horri-
fied if we realized that all foreign nations
are merely people families of men women and
children-with hofkes and aspirations like our
own and with no more desire to kill than we
have then all thought of war with them would
be abhorrent-editor

  some overdue praise to beattie

editor wonder stories

  i receive the greatest enjoyment in reading
your reader speaks it gives everybody a
chance to get some criticism out of their sys-
tems it also gives other readers plenty of
food for thought

  until recently i have been bothered by an
obsesbion that there was something missing in
all the letters i have read it suddenly came
to me as i was reading a story in the april
issue entitled the man who shrank its
just this all the correspondents have been
handing out the praises to such authors as
williamson keller and others and not one
out of ten even mentioned george b beattie
i am not saying that keller and the rest are
not superb writers but it is my opinion that
mr beattie is far the greater author if the
readers would notice that all of his stories are
entirely different from the other authors not
only that but each one of his manuscripts are
different from the first one most notice i
do not say all authors write stuff on the same
general line keller writes mostly on biology
and medicine not all the time but most of
the time the others do likewise

  so the main purpose of this letter is to give a
little long over due praise to mr beattie so
heres wishing you a long and successful life as
wonder stories best author mr beattie

  now as for the rest of the magazine i can
truthfully say that i do not like mr taines
type of writing in the least i suppose i am
just different from the rest because all i see in
your columns are letters of praise one right
after the other he seems to go over all right
with the rest of the science fiction world so ill
not be selfish and ask you to kick him out if
the rest like him leave him in

  i wish to give a separate paragraph to the
honor of a new writer mr carl w spohr the
author of that magnetic smash the final
way it is the best story published for quite
awhile i and im sure that others hope to
see more of his work among your pages for
a starter that story is wonder-ful alright

  keep up your marvelous work

                 stockton shaw

                  san francisco calif

  as an example of mr beatties best work
with one of his original themes and plots wo
recommend the platinum planets  in the
current issue we shall be glad to get mr
shaws opinion on it we agree with him on
beatties talents although we do not wish to
take sides on the question-who is our best
author that is something our readers must
decide---editor

some really brainy fellows

editor wonder stories

  i am a bit worried about this letter i start-
ed off to write a condemnation of taines
time stream and as is my wont i read it
through once more to crystallize my antipathy

  now i eant find anything wrong with it i
yes you must certainly publish more of mr
taines work its great i

  maybe i am rather late with my opinions
but i have only just received the march issue
which is a grand success with perhaps one
slight defect

  there were three war stories in it they
were all good ones it is true but couldnt you
have carried one over to the next issue no
matter how well they are written stories with
that theme are bound to have something of a
sameness about them and to read three to
gether is slightly monotonous    however

  ever since you changed the size of our
magazine to x it has steadily improved
until one would consider that it had reached
the peak of perfection but it is plain to see
that wonder stories can never stop progress
ing it must go on and on until the people of
ad heavens know when regard it as a his-
torical encyclopedia    take that as you
will 

  but what a lot of rot i am talking   

  back in the february issue a nasty fellow
by the name of abbey a schwartz aired his
conviction that wonder stories was read only
by morons-to use one of your expressive idioms
probably since then you have been flooded with
correspondence containing definite proof to the
contrary but i must certainly add my little bit
to the deluge

  here in an area of about  miles we have
nearly a score of members all of whom read this
magazine they are all well-educated and we
have one or two really brainy fellows among us
and you cant kid me that they read wonder
stories just for amusement because as secre-
tary of our science fiction club i know dif
ferently

  we glean an enormous amount of scientific
and general information which is all filed and
indexed for future reference and the fellow in
charge of this information bureau has a buby
time of it i can tell you

  so there

  one of our members who has artistic lean-
ings disagrees with those who want paul to
do all the illustrations he say that to il-
lustrate a whole magazine is too much and
may lead to stereotyping personally i know
nothing about the business but i certainly
think a little variation would improve matters
-though i hasten to add that no one can
come up to pauls standard

  i should be glad if you would send me a
supply of the s f movie blanks as i have
a clubful of members waiting to sign and they
do not wish to mutilate their magazines i
presume that petitions from england will have
as much effect on hollywood as from anywhere
else

  heres to the next issue

                  secretary s f c

                  hayes middlesex england

  we think that the opinion from our read-
ers has effectively disposed of mr schwartz
however after all of this refutation we shall
be glad to hear from him again if he still wishes
the use of our columns in expressing his
point of view-editor

  speaking of that dynamic story

editor wonder stories

  after reading many brickbats thrown at mr
schwartz who by now must be hiding his face
in shame i wonder why the readers do not
give a little credit where credit is due i am
speaking ofthat dynamic story the conquest
of two worlds i was surprised that this
story did not receive more than a flurry of com-
ment even mr hamilton will have a hard
time to duplicate this story which seems destined
to pass as another story to most readers
speaking of credit it is hard to pass up mr
gernsbacks editorials which seem to score in
every issue

  i am glad to see that a sequel to the final
war is going to appear in a future issue it
will be interesting to note how mr spohr will
bring together the far-thrown effects of that ter
rible war which he pictured previously

  the june issue proved to be a pip containing
only one mediocre story-the message from
mars this story could have been made more
plausible by using a more plausible way of con

a study in chromosomes

editor wonder stories

  this letter concerns the last woman
which appeared in the april  issue
this story i consider to be one of the best
most original for science and plot story you
have printed yet-i took this opinion on the
third reading the determinants of sex sug-
gested in pie story irritated my curiosity bump
and made me want to learn more about it
so i did a bit of research work

  the results of my research work did not
agree with the story in all particulars but the
high-lights synchronized

  on page  mr gardner states that the
xx and xy chromosomes are the determin-
ants of sex the former fertilizing an ovum
gives a female the latter a male i found
that the y chromosome had nothing to do
with the determining of sex-that the xx
chromosomes produce femaleness while an x
single x chromosome produces maenes

  furthermore-the sperm dons not contain
an xx or xy chromosome it contains either
an x or a y chromosome when the sperm
unites with the ovum the ovum contains an x
chromosome the x or y chromosome-which-
ever the sperm contains-combines with the x
chromosome of the ovum

  if the sperm did contain an xx or xy
chromosome when it united with the ovum-
which would have to contain an equal number
of chromosomes-there would be double the
number of chromosomes in the body in a
human being there are  chromosomes in each
cell determining the dominant characteristics
of the person if the person had a parent
with curly hair and brown eyes and a parent
with straight hair and blue eyes the person
would have either curly hair and brown eyes
or straight hair and blue eyes with the chances
of having the c h and b e in the ratio of
 to  favoring the c h and b e-this is a
direct result of the mendelian law a list
of the dominant and recessive characters follov

book reviews

riddles of science by sir j ar-
thur thomson  pages stiff cloth
covers illustrated size x
published by liveright inc new
york price 

the distinguished scotch scientist author of
the outline of science has written a number
of suggestive and stimulating essays on unex-
plained and apparently mysterious scientific
phenomena

with calmness and lucidity sir arthur digs
into such diverse subjects as suspended anima-
tion mental telepathy spiritualism evolution
sex emotions the nine lives of the cat and many
natural history credulities

his method is not to attempt a definite scien-
tific explanation for things that have puzzled the
race for centuries rather he tries to extract
from observed facts what residue of actual
scientific basis exists and bo narrow the range
of posible explanations those who come to
the book expecting to have their favorite super-
stitions explained away will doubtlessly be dis-

appointed but new avenues of thought will
undoubtedly be stimulated the book is absorb
ing and intensely worthwhile throughout

how to be interesting by robert
  e rogers  pages stiff cloth cov-
  ers size x published by l c
  page  co boston price f

   professor rogers attempts here the gigantic
 task of telling us how to develop interesting per-
 sonalities as he states he does hot pretend tq
 outline any -minute-a-day course or promise
 succcss in life to the readers of the book rather
 he outlines the elements of personality and why
 some people are interesting and others are
 bores we learn in the last analysis that people
 who hold our attention are those who really have
 something to say who say it with clean arti-
 culation and sincerity two things are neces-
 sary in so far as people themselves are con-
 cerned the first is the will to be interesting
 and the second is the will to be interested
 the book is amusing and clever in places and
 on the whole reads well

prohibiting minds by stewart
  paton mjl  pages stiff cloth
  covers size x published by paul
  b hoeber inc new york price
  

   dr paton is  psychiatrist and looks at the
 problems confronting the world from the stand-
 point of our mental processes his conclusion
 is that our present day chaos has resulted from
 our inability or unwillingness to think through
 our complex problems whenever we meet a so-
 cial phenomena that needs careful study and
 research we immediately seek for a law or a
 means of prohibiting something as a result we
 have burdened our social system with a mass
 of prohibitions that prevent truth from seeing
 the light of day and invert our own mental
 processes

   we try to prohibit war drinking sex emo
 tions gambling and even babies dr eaton
 pictures america as a place where maamen
 rush about snooping into other peoples affairs
 seeking for something to prohibit these peo-
 ple are affected says the author with some
 mental perversion of their own that urges
 them on he would have us beware of such

   there is undoubtedly a good dealof truth
in dr patons theme but he reiterates it
tonelessly so many times throughout the book
that one feels that he is circling his theme
unable to develop it further however it gives
us a useful survey of our lunatic civilization

psychiana

the religion of power

a new and revolutionary religious teaching based entirely on the misunderstood sayings of the galilean
carpenter and designed to show how to find and use the same identical power that he used

 psychiana -

believes and teaches as follows

first-that there is no such thing as a subconscious mind

second-that there is in this universe a far more potent and
           dynamic power the manifestations of which have been
           erroneously credited to some other supposed power called the
           subconscious mind

third-that this invisible dynamic power is the very same
          power that jesus used when he staggered the nations by
          his so-called miracles and by raising the dead

fourth-that jesus had no monopoly on this power

fifth-that it is possible for every normal human being understand-
            ing spiritual law as he understood it to duplicate
            every work that this carpenter of galilee
            ever did when he said the things that i do shall ye do
            also-he meant exactly what he said

sixth-that this dynamic power is not to be found within but
has its source in a far different direction

seventh- that the words of this galilean carpenter
         went a thousand miles over the heads of his
         hearers  years ago and are still a thou-
         sand miles over the heads of those who pro-
         fess to follow him today

eighth-that this same mighty invisible pulsating throb-
          bing power can be used by anyone-at any hour of
          the day or night and without such methods as going
          into the silence or gazing at bright objects etc

ninth-that when once understood and correctly used this mighty
           power is abundantly able and never fails to
           give health happiness and overwhelming suc-
           cess in whatever proper line it may be desired

dr frank b robinson
founder of psychiana and author of
-the god nobody knows america
awakening etc

dr frank b robinson

considered by many to be one of the keenest psycho-
logical minds this country has ever produced and one
of the most earnest intense searchers into tbispiritual
s realm believes after years of experimentation and
 research that there is in this world today an unseen
power or force so dynamic in itself  that all other

powers or forces fade into insignificance
beside it he believes that this power or force is
the very same power that jesus used
he believes further that the entire world including the
presentchurch structure missed in its entirety
the message that he came to bring he believes that

the world is on the verge of the most stupendous spiritual upheaval it has ever experienced-the
advent of christ being of small importance when compared to it
