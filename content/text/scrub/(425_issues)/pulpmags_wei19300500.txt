t wtt there do you think poe and e t a hoffmann would take their
ww stuff if they were alive today asks william bolitho in his article

  	 on pulp magazines in the new york world and he supplies
by inference the answer in weird tales of course

    the pulp magazines have had few defenders for it is the custom of snob-
bery to look down on them as something inferior in literary merit it is
refreshing therefore to see a recognized authority on contemporary literature
rise to their defense the pulp magazines says mr bolitho are printed on
paper which in a short year is yellow in five more cracks and crumbles and
by the time its first peruser is earning  a week and has a garage will have
utterly disappeared in dust as it is it is harder to find a given out-of-print
back number of any one of them than a first folio of shakespeare  i will
distinguish them roughly into three unequal classes the detective magazines
the adventure series and those of general fancy  those two we will for
the moment leave for the third queer class that is the most curious it is
composed of collections of short tales of fancy and imagination a curious
internal classification well understood by the adepts rules here the range
is roughly to use names from astounding stories of superscience as the
french would say on the right through amazing stories in the -center to
the altogether admirable-that is my personal taste-weird tales on the
extreme left of imagination which adds proudly to its title the unique mag-
azine

    now the real defense of this class of popular literature has to be ex-
plained    literature like all the arts at its worst and at its best has
this in common all through it is an assistance to the imagination at worst
it is a prop a crutch to the imagination that allows not more than a walk
which is cumbersome and which health finally discards the highest reaches
of art not only support you but by a mysterious internal working suffuse you
like wine as against crutches to such a degree that in certain cases it may
even stimulate into action an independent and original creative faculty it-
self  in youth especially there are certain works which in themselves

weird tales

                     continued from page 
later in cold middle-aged blood perhaps seem mere frameworks but which
eminently and delightfully serve as catalysts for the imagination which in
everyone is then at its boiling-point to combine with the unutterable and
endless beauty of the world so these magazines i know as well as anyone
that they are in a certain proportion as large as you like the product of
hack writers what does that matter the strange thing in these circles is that
criticism is probably much more remorseless and sincere than in the more
pretentious for hack or not whatever the pay each of the pulp magazine
authors has to produce interest he has to hold his readers not merely to
show how clever he is or he is lost

    and the standard the unjust literary standard itself is surprizingly
satisfied often with them make no mistake about that in almost any one
of them there are one or two that are really good not merely catalytic as i
have said but nourishing why should not this be so why here is the
folklore stratum where the stoutest talents have always rooted themselves
here and not in the artificial heat of tender little highbrow reviews is where
one should look for the real new talent   

  in this world there are chiefs evidently i am inclined to think they must
be pretty good there are otis adelbert kline and h p loveeraft whom i
am sure i would rather read than many fashionable lady novelists they give
teas to and poets too meditate on that you who are tired of the strained
prettiness of the verse in the great periodicals that there are still poets here of
the pure poe school who sell and are printed for a vast public  

    i have been a reader of weird tales since the first issue writes d v
simpson of marion ohio i have not missed more than one or two copies
in all that time ever since i was a child i have beeu partial to stories of
the type that you publish but until the appearance of this magazine there
were very few of them to be had of all those who write for weird tales-
and most of your authors are fine-i think i prefer loveeraft i wish that
his stories might appear much more often and i think this is the prevailing
sentiment among your readers

    a letter from rose niescik of south banehester connecticut says be-
hind the moon ended very well and the whole adventure was very exciting
but i think that the new serial the black monarch will surpass it its very
thrilling i like that kind of story thirsty blades was also very good i cant
wait till i receive the march issue 

    a letter from arthur l bayne of brooklyn new york says for the
first time since i started reading weird tales i am enclosing the favorite
stories coupon beyond question the thought monster is a marvelous crea-
tion of the author your stories have always averaged high i like par-
ticularly the interplanetary tales strange lands and strange peoples are
always engrossing let me again repeat that weird tales gives me the spice
for my monthly literary meals

shadows on the road

         by robert e howard

         nial of ulster welcome home

         what saw you on the road to rome -

          legions thronging the fertile plains 

          shouting hordes of the country folk

          with the harvest heaped in their groaning wains
          shepherds piping under the oak 

          laurel chaplet and purple cloak

          smokes of the feasting coiled on high 

          meadows and fields of the rich ripe green
          lazing under a cobalt sky

          brown little villages sleeping between

         what saw you on the road to rome 

          crimson tracks in the blackened loam

          skeleton trees and a blasted plain

          a heap of skulls and a child insane

         ruin and wreck and the reek of pain
         on the wrack of the road to rome

         nial what saw you in rome -

          purple emperors riding there

          down aisles with walls like marble foam

          to the golden trumpets mystic flare 

         dark-eyed women who bind their hair

          as they bind mens hearts with a silver comb
          spires that cleave through the crystal air

          arch and altar and amaranth stair

          nial what saw you in rome 

          broken shrines in the sobbing gloam

          bare feet spurning the marble flags

          towers fallen and walls digged up

          a woman in chains and filthy rags
          goths in the forum howled to sup

          with an emperors skull for a drinking-cup

          the black arch clave to the broken dome

          the coliseum invites the bat

          the vandal sits where the caesars sat

         and the shadows are black on rome

          nial nial now you are home

         why do you mutter and lonely roam 

             my brain is sick and i know no rest

          my heart is stone in my frozen breast

          for the feathers fall from the eagles crest
          and the bright sea breaks in foam-

         kings and kingdoms and empires fall

          and the mist-black ruin covers them all

          and the honey of life is bitter gall
          since i traveled the road to rome

please there is something i would
have you hear if you can spare the

  the tali young man prematurely
gray at the temples seated opposite
de grandin rose as i entered the study
and greeted me with an air of re-

distance as possible if youll excuse

me- i began turning toward the

door

  pcvrbleu that is exactly what i
shall not i de grandin denied i
know what you think my friend i
know what everyone thinks but i
shall make you and all of them change
your minds yes by damn i swear it
come good friend be reasonable sit
and listen to the story i have heard
suspending your judgment meantime

  say it again young monsieur
he ordered the visitor relate your
so pitiful tale from the beginning
that dr trowbridge may know as
much as i

  there was such a look of distress
on young nortons face as he looked
half pleadingly half fearfully at me
that had he been anything but the
thoroughgoing scoundrel he was i
could have found it in my heart to be
sorry for him it seems isabel and
i have been divorced he began
almost tentatively i-i suppose i
wasnt as good to her as i might have
been-

  you suppose you confounded
young whelp i burst out you
know you treated that girl as no
decent man would treat a dog you
know perfectly well you broke her
heart and every promise you made
her at the altar-you smashed her life
and betrayed her confidence and the
confidence of every misguided friend

who trusted you- i choked with

anger and wheeled furiously on de
grandin

  listen to me i ordered i
dont know what this good-for-nothing
young reprobate has been telling you
but  tell you whatever hes said is a
pack of lies-lies from beginning to
end ive known him all his life-
helped him begin breathing thirty
years ago by slapping his two-seconds-
ld posterior with a wet towel-and
ive known the girl he married all her
life too he and she were bom with-
in a city block of each other less than
i month apart their parents were

friends they went to school together
and played together and were boy
and girl sweethearts when they
finally married all us old fools whod
watched them grow from childhood
swarmed round and gave them our
blessing then by george before
theyd been married a year this
young jackanapes showed himself in
his true colors he abused her beat
her finally deserted her and ran off
with his best friends wife if thats
the sort of story youve listened to
im surprized- 

  cordieu surprized you most as-
suredly shall be my friend but not
as you think de grandin inter-
rupted be good enough to seize
your tongue-tip between thumb and
forefinger while the young monsieur
concludes his story

  i dont expect you to believe me
sir young norton began again i
dont know id believe such a story
if it were told me-but its true all
the same as far as i can remember
the last time i saw isabel was this
morning when i left for the office
wed had a little misunderstanding-
nothing serious but enough to put us
both in a huff-and i stopped at
caminellis and bought some roses as
a peace-offering on my way home to-
night

  i fairly ran the last half-block to
the house and didnt wait for the
maid to let me in it was when i got
in the hall i first noticed changes
most of the old furniture was gone
and what remained was standing in
different places i thought shes
been doing a lot of house-cleaning
since this morning but that was all

i	was too anxious to find her and
make up you see

  i called isabel isabel once or
twice but no one answered then i
ran upstairs

  he paused looking pleadingly at
me and the half-puzzled half-
frightened look which had been on his
face throughout his recital deepened

  there was a nurse-a nurse in
the brain-thief



hospital uniform-leaving the room
as i ran down the upper hall he
continued slowly she looked at me
and smiled and said  why how nice
of you to bring the flowers mr nor-
ton im sure theyll be delighted
that they didnt mean anything
to me then but a moment later it did
on the bed with a little new baby
cuddled in the curve of her elbow lay
betty baintree try and realize that
dr trowbridge betty jack bain-
trees wife whom id last seen at the
colony countiy club dance last
thursday night was lying in bed in
my house a young baby in her arms

     she greeted me familiarly  why
 kit dear she said i didnt expect
 you so soon thanks for the flowers
 honey  then  come kiss baby shes
 been restless for her daddy the last
 half-hour 

   it was then she seemed to notice

 	the look of blank amazement on my
 face for the first time kit boy
 whatever is the matter she asked

dont you-

   wha-what are you doing here
 betty i managed to gasp isabel-
 where is she

   isabelv she echoed incredu-
 lously whats got into you dear-
 what makes you look so strangely
 havent you any greeting for your
 wife and baby  

   my-wife-and-baby i stam-
mered but-

   i dont know just what happened
 next sir ive a confused recollection
 of staggering from that accursed
 room stumbling down the stairs and
 meeting the nurse who looked at me
 as though shed seen a ghost then
 tottering toward the door and run-
 ning hatless and coatless to my
 mothers house in aubumdale ave-
 nue i ran up the steps tried the
 door and found it locked then i
 almost beat in the panels with my
 fists a strange maid not old sadie
 answered my frantic summons and
 looked at me as though she suspected
 my reason the family occupying

 the house was named bronson she
 told me theyd lived there for the
 past two years-since shortly after
 the widow nortons death

   am i mad or is this all some
horrible nightmare i asked myself
as i turned once more toward my
home or rather toward the house
which had been my home this morn-
ing

  it wasnt a dream as i assured
myself when i returned and found
betty crying hysterically in bed with
the nurse trying to comfort her and
looking poisoned daggers at me as i
came in the door

t got my hat and coat and wan-

  t- dered about town looking for
someone i knew-someone who might
offer me a ray of comforting light to
guide me through the terrible fog into
which i seemed to have plunged half
a block from home i met dr ray-
mond of the presbyterian church
whom id known since i was a lad in
his sunday schools infant class i
spoke to him tried to stop him but
he passed me without a sign of recog-
nition either he cut me dead or
failed to see me as though id been a
disembodied spirit

  finally i managed to locate
freddy myers he and i were in
high school and college together and
had always been good friends he let
me in but that was about all not a
word of greeting save a chilly how
do you do not a smile not even a
handshake did he offer me and he re-
mained standing after id come into
the hall and made no move to take my
hat and coat or invite me to be seated

  i put the proposition squarely up
to him told him what id just been
through and asked him for gods sake
to tell me where isabel was the news
of my mothers death two years before
was shock enough but isabels disap-
pearance-betty baintree in my
house and the baby-i was like an
earthman suddenly set down on the
moon


weird tales

  for a while fred listened to me
as lie might have listened to the rav-
ings of a drunken man then he asked
me if i were trying to kid him when
i assured him i was sincere in my
questions he grew angry and told
me just as you have dr trowbridge
how i d abased isabel how my dis-
graceful amours with other women
had finally forced her to divorce me
and how i was ostracized by every
decent man whod known me in the
old days finally he ordered me out
and told me hed punch my face if
i ever spoke to him again

  i dont know what to think sir
freddys abuse was so genuine his
anger so manifestly sincere and his
scorn so patently righteous that i
knew it couldnt all be some ghastly
practical joke of which i was the vic-
tim besides there was the strange
maid in mothers house and the news
of mothers death-that couldnt have
been arranged wen if isabel and
betty and freddy had joined in a
conspiracy to punish me for the burst
of nasty temper i showed this morn-
ing

  for a little while i thought id
gone crazy and all the astonishing
things which seemed tp have happened
were only the vagaries of a lunatic
indeed sir im not sure im sane
even yet-i hope to god i in not but
what am i to do cant anybody ex-
plain the situation to me suppose
you found yourself in my place sir  
he turned appealing haunted eyes on
me

  	 then i remembered hearing some-
one tell of the wonderful things dr
de grandin did he concluded id
been told hed corrected maladjusted
destinies as though by magic some-
times  so ive come here as a last re-
sort

 youre my last hope dr de
grandin he finished tragically i
dont know except by inference and
such reconstruction of events as i can
make from the crazy meaningless
things ive seen and heard tonight

whats happened but one thing seems
certain for the last two years time
has stood still for me theres been
a slice of two years carved right out
of my memory and all the terrible
things which have occurred during
that period are a sealed book to me
cant you do something for me sir
if you cant for gods sake send me
to a lunatic asylum i dont know
just what sins ive committed but
even though ive committed them un-
consciously the uncertainty of it all
is driving me to madness and an
asylum seems the only refuge left  
jules de grandin brushed the
tightly waxed ends of his small blond
mustache with the tip of a well-mani-
cured forefinger i think we need
not consider the padded cell as yet
my friend he encouraged at
present i am inclined to prescribe a
stiff dose of dr trowbridges best
brandy for you-and a like potion
for myself

 and now monsieur he con-
tinued as he drained the final drop of
cognac from his goblet   i would sug-
gest that you take the medicine i shall
prepare then go to bed-friend
trowbridge has a spare chamber for
your accommodation  

  for a few moments he busied him-
self in the surgery returning with a
beaker of grayish cloudy liquid
which young norton tossed off at a
gulp

npen minutes later with my un-
welcome guest soundly sleeping in
my spare bedroom de grandin took
up a pencil and pad of note-paper and
turned to me tell me mon vieux
he ordered all you can of this so
unfortunate young mans domestic
tragedy

  humph i retorted still smart-
ing at the generous use he had made
of my hospitality theres precious
little to tell kit norton is a rotter
from the backbone out theres not an
ounce of decency in his whole make-
up the girl he married was one of
the brain-thief



the finest young women in the city
absolutely above reproach in every
way and they seemed ideally happy
for a little time then without a mo-
ments warning his whole nature
seemed to change he became an utter
sot found fault with everything she

did	and blamed her for his business
reverses-he had plenty of em too
for he began to neglect his real estate
office at the same time he began
neglecting his wife-and it wasnt
long before his affairs with other
women became the scandal of the
town the climax came when he and
betty baintree eloped

  norton and frank baintree had
been inseparable friends from boy-
hood frank married betty a short
time after kit and isabel were mar-
ried and the couples continued the
friendship when kit and betty ran
off of course the lid blew off the
whole rotten mess it was then we all
realized kits contemptible conduct
toward isabel was all part of a de-
liberately planned scheme to force her
to divorce him-and the proof of it
was that betty had acted toward
frank just as kit had acted toward
isabel for about the same period
theres no doubt of it the brazen
pair had conspired to force a divorce
so they could be free to marry and
when their plans failed to work they
had the effrontery to elope leaving
identical notes with their deserted
partners its an unsavory business
from start to finish de grandin and
i wish you hadnt gotten mixed up in
it for-

  non let us not be too hasty
friend trowbridge the little
frenchman interrupted see you
have already given me much of im-
portance to think of had not ma-
dame bettys conduct been identical
with that of monsieur christopher i
might have seen a reason for it all
as it is-eh bien i know not quite
what to think such cases however
are not altogether unknown once
before i have seen something like this

a certain tradesman in lyons-a
draper he was-left his home for the
shop one morning and was heard
from no more five years passed
and he was thought dead by all who
knew him when pouf where should
he be found but living in marseilles
happy and respectable as oould be
with another wife and a family of
fine healthy children in lyons he
had been a draper in marseilles he
was a bricklayer-a trade by the
way for which he had no apparent
ability in his former life maurice
simon his name was but in marseilles
he knew himself only as jean dufour
every test was made to prove him a
malingerer but it seemed established
beyond all reasonable doubt that the
unfortunate man was actually suffer-
ing a split consciousness-all memory
of his former life in lyons was com-
pletely obliterated from his mind and
his wife and children were utter
strangers to him reproaches and
argument alike left him unmoved i
am jean dufour bricklayer of mar-
seilles he repeated stubbornly at
last they managed to convince him of
his identity the realization of what
he had done how he had wrecked two
womens lives and the lives of his
children drove him mad he died
raving in a hospital for the insane
but that cant possibly be the
case here  expostulated we

know-

  pardonnez-moi we know nothing
even less   de grandin denied
come let us go

  go i echoed go where
to interview madame betty of
course he returned coolly i may
be wrong but unless i am moie mis-
taken than i think we may find inter-
esting developments at her home
grumbling but with my curiosity
piqued i rose to accompany him to
the pretty little cottage where kit
norton had taken his bride three
years before

  it is most sti-ange he muttered
as we passed through the quiet


weird tales

streets it seems hardly likely the
poor monsieur christopher should
have suffered the same fate and

yet- he broke off musingly

  whats that i asked sharply
annoyed at his persistent sympathy
for young norton

  i did but think aloud he re-
turned the unfortunate gentleman
of lyons of whom i spoke earlier in
the evening-his aberration was an
oddly tangled one investigations by
the police showed that several days
before he deserted his family and set
out for marseilles he had an alterca-
tion with a certain fortune-telling
man from the east indeed he had
gone so far as to tweak his nose and
the oriental had pronounced a curse
of forgetfulness on him  

as we paused before the cottage
gate a long roadster driven as
though contending for a racing-
trophy dashed past us and stopped
at the curb with a screeching of
sharply applied brakes a moment
later its occupant leaped out and ran
at breakneck speed up the brick path
leading to nortons front stoop
lesterdale i exclaimed in sur-
prize

  eh what do you say de gran-
din asked

 thats lesterdale the best nerve
man in the city i responded won-
der what brings him here

  let us see the frenchman re-
turned matter-of-factly the house
is open let us enter 

  dr lesterdale had a case worthy of
all his skill we discovered almost as
soon as we marched unbidden into
nortons cottage

  betty norton crouched in her bed
her knees drawn up her chin resting
on them and her arms flailing the un-
resisting air with the fury of the
grand movement stage of hysteria as
we paused at the bedroom door we
caught a glimpse of her tear-smeared
face as she stared wildly about the
room with wide horror-numbed eyes

frank she shrieked oh frank
my love where are you

  doctor she bent a terrified look
on lesterdale   i dreamed-i thought
i was kit nortons wife that i was
the mother of-oh say it isnt true
doctor  

  tiens what is this de grandin
muttered has she too emerged
from a state of suspended memory

  lesterdales eyes weie cool with
professional unconcern like every-
one else in the city he knew the scan-
dal of bettys divorce and remar-
riage and had he been there in any
capacity other than that of physician
i could well imagine how his glance
would have been blank with cold con-
tempt as he looked at the pretty
woman contorted on the bed
water he ordered shortly of the
terrified nurse

  a moment later he dissolved a small
white tablet in the half-filled tumbler
she brought plunged the nozzle of his
hypodermic into the mixture and
barked another order alcohol-
sponge-in the case yonder he
snapped

  the nurse got the alcohol and a
cotton sponge from his kit and
swabbed bettys left arm

  the needle pierced the girls deli-
cate skin and i saw a blister rise as
the morphia went home before the
syringe-plungers pressure

  see the child has substitute feed-
ings-dextri-maltose milk and water
wilsons formula no -cant have
it nurse with the mother full o mor-
phine call me if she kicks up another
row   lesterdale glanced appraising-
ly at betty noted the narcotic already
stealing over her and turned toward
the door she ought to be quiet for
the rest of the night   he added over
his shoulder

  oh hullo trowbridge he called
as he recognized me by the door
whats up did they rout you out
too devil of a note dragging a man
from the bridge table to calm a con-
science-stricken female what
the brain-thief



  but do you think its just an at-
tack of conscience i countered
mightnt it be a case of puerperal
insan-

  no he cut in not even lacta-
tional neurosis no symptom of it
its hysteria pure and simple or-
he smiled acidly-more simple than
pure id say considering whos hav-
ing it dont see how it happened
but somethings awakened the little
strumpets conscience and its hurt-
ing her like the devil good-night
he nodded shortly as he passed down
the hall without a backward glance

  mordieu he is hard that one
hard like a nail de grandin mur-
mured a good neurologist he may
be friend trowbridge but i think he
is also a monumental fool let us
interrogate the garde-malade

  the nurse recognized me with a
start of surprize as we edged into the
room mr norton called at my

office and- i began but she cut

me short

     oh he did did he   she returned
sourly i should think he would

after what hes done he-

  slowly mademoiselle if you
please   de grandin urged   our per-
ceptions are dull and you go too fast
what precisely did monsieur norton
do

  the girl stared at him what
she echoed plenty he came home
from the office with a beautiful bou-
quet then pretended he didnt know
his own wife and baby and went fly-
ing out of the house like a crazy man

he drove the poor thing to this-

she glanced compassionately at betty
he hadnt been gone half an hour
when she went completely to pieces
and started raving like a lunatic  
ah de grandin tweaked his
mustache meditatively now we
begin to make progress what if you
please was the exact nature of her
delusion   

  the nurse considered a moment
years of hospital training had taught
her accurate observation where symp-

toms were concerned and profession-
al habit was stronger than womanly
anger she began crying as though
her heart would break she replied
slowly then when he came back
the second time and stared wildly in
the room before rushing off again
she seemed to change completely ive
never seen anything like it one mo-
ment she was crying and wringing
her hands begging mr norton to
recognize her the next she was like a
different woman just for a moment
she stopped crying and a sort of
dazed surprized look came into her
eyes then she looked round the room
as though shed never seen it before-
like a casualty victim coming out of
the ether in the emergency ward
she finished with professional clarity

  this dazed bewildered condition
lasted only a moment then like a
woman recovering from a faint she
asked where am i

     i soothed her as best i could told
her mr norton had gone out for a
moment but would be back directly
and held the baby out to her this
seemed to excite her all the more 
had to explain where she was who she
was and who the baby was-can you
imagine instead of calming her it
seemed to make her worse she stared
unbelievingly at me and when i
showed her the baby again she fell to
screaming at the top of her voice and
calling for somebody named frank
have you any idea who it could be
dr trowbridge

  what else happened i re-
turned evading her question

  thats all sir i grew alarmed
when she seemed to shrink from her
own child and called dr l terdale
hes the best nerve man in town
dont you think

  quite i agreed if you-

  non mon ami de grandin inter-
rupted trouble the good mademoi-
selle no more we have already heard
enough-parbleu i fear we have
heard more than we can conveniently
piece together come let us go


weird tales

  grand dieu he murmured as we
reached the street it is amazing it
is astonishing it is bewildering has
the clock of time turned back and are
we once more in the seventeenth
century

  eh i asked

  is witchcraft rampant in our
midst he returned barbe dun
bouc my friend i know not whether
to say we have witnessed two most
extraordinary eases of mental de-
rangement or something wholly and
entirely infernal  



homer abbot son of my old school-
mate judge winslow abbot and
one of the cleverest of the younger
members of the local bar was waiting
nervously in my consulting-room next
morning its about marjorie he
began almost before we had ex-
changed greetings im dreadfully
worried about her doctor

  whats wrong i asked noting
the parentheses of wrinkles which
worry had etched between his brows
do you want me to run over and
look at her

  no sir im afraid this business
is a little out of your line he con-
fessed to tell you the truth ive
come to you more as a friend than as
a physician he paused a moment
as though debating whether to con-
tinue then shes been acting
queerly recently about a week ago
she began coming down to breakfast
all crocked up-circles under her eyes
no more life than a wet handkerchief
and all that sort of thng you know
i was concerned at once and begged
her to come to you but she just
laughed at me

  its gone from bad to worse since
shes irritable as the deuce-flies off
the handle at nothing scolds me like
a shrew with or without reason most
of the time she seems actually trying
to avoid me makes every kind of ex-

cuse to keep from coming to the door
with me in the morning pleads a
headache or some other indisposition
to get away from me in the evening
even-

  hm i smiled knowingly to my-
self a happy explanation of mar-
jories sudden vagaries had occurred
to me but homers next words killed
it

  three nights ago i happened to
wake up about one oclock he hur-
ried on you know that feeling of
vague malaise we sometimes have for
no reason at all thats what i felt
when i sat up in bed and looked
round everything was quiet-too
quiet-in the room i switched on the
night light and looked across at mar-
jories bed it was empty

  i waited and waited when half
an hour went by with no sign of her
i couldnt stand it any more i looked
everywhere-went through the house
from cellar to attic she wasnt any-
where it wasnt till id finished my
search and returned almost frantic to
the bedroom that i noticed her cloth-
ing was missing from the chair where
she usually puts it when i went to
the closet i found her heavy sports
coat gone too

     i sat up waiting for her till nearly
five oclock finally i couldnt stick it
any more and dropped off to sleep

  marjorie was sleeping peacefully
as a child when i woke two hours
later and when i tried to rouse her
and ask where shed been during the
night she turned from me like a fret-
ful child too and mumbled something
about wanting to be let alone

  i tried my best to ask her about
it that evening but she had a couplo
of girl friends in to dinner and wo
played contract afterward so i didnt
get a word alone with her till after
eleven when the company left then
she fairly ran upstairs to bed com-
plaining of a splitting headache and
each time i tried to speak to her she
the brain-thief



begged me to let her alone to suffer
in peace

  i dont think she went out that
night but i dont know

  eh i asked impressed by the
emphasis he laid on the last four
words   how d ye mean   

  for answer he thrust his hand into
his waistcoat pocket and extracted a
tiny square of folded white paper
what do you make of this he
asked handing me the packet

  i opened the paper disclosing a
dust of fine white crystalline powder
wet my forefinger gathered a few
grains of the substance on it and
touched it to my tongue good
heavens i ejaculated

  morphine isnt it he asked
  no it is codein i returned

where-

  on her dresser yesterday morn-
ing he cut in and there was an-
other like it with a few grains of the
stuff still adhering to the paper on
the pantry shelf we had coffee with
our refreshments the night before
and i thought mine tasted bitter but
the others laughed at me so i thought
maybe the trouble was with me rather
than the coffee by the way marjorie
brought the coffee in herself that
night and it wasnt till i found these
powdeis that i recalled she brought
mine in separately the only cup on
the tray-no chance for me to take
the wrong one that way you see

  i slept like a log that night and
woke with a queer dizzy feeling yes-
terday morning marjorie was still
asleep when i was dressed and ready
for breakfast and it was just by
chance i discovered the powder you
see i thought perhaps her headache
was still troubling her and went to
her dresser for some cologne thats
where i found the package i just
showed you i thought i recognized
it they gave me something of the kind
in the hospital at st nazaire during
the war

  but see here boy i expostu-
lated maybe were making a moun-
tain of a molehill this stuffs codein
beyond doubt and marjorie shouldnt
be allowed to have it but its possible
some quack gave it her for those head-
aches shes been complaining of-
mere than one womans been made a
dope fiend that way that feeling of
depression you had on waking-

  wasnt present this morning he
interrupted sharply i dont know
how i came to reason it all out but
the moment i found that infernal
stuff i knew shed drugged my coffee
the previous night so i took the
paper and went downstairs and fixed
a dummy pack with table salt and left
it where id found the codein on her
dresser it was while i was looking
for salt to make the dummy i found
the empty codein paper in the pantry

  dr trowbridge he leaned for-
ward impressively last night after
dinner my coffee was salty as brine

  young homer abbot and i faced
each other a moment in solemn-eyed
silence i opened my lips to utter
some banality but he hurried on

  i pretended to become sleepy
almost immediately and went to bed
-but i didnt undress marjorie
didnt trouble even to come upstairs
to see if i had fallen asleep i sup-
pose she was so sure the dope had
done its work i heard the front door
close before id been in bed half an
hour and jumped up slipped on my
shoes and jacket and ran after her
i got down just in time to see her taxi
round the comer and though i chased
it like a hound hunting a rabbit it
lost me in the fog and i had to give
up

  marjorie came in a few minutes
after five this morning he con-
cluded then because he was still
little more than a boy and because
his happy little world had tumbled to
pieces before his eyes homer abbot
put his arm down on my desk pil-


weird tales

lowed his face against it and cried
like a heart-broken child

  poor chap i sympathized poor
boy its a rotten shame and-

  and we had best be stirring our-
selves to correct it my friend jules
de grandin supplemented as he
stepped noiselessly into the room

  i must ask forgiveness for eaves-
dropping he added as he paused be-
side me but i caaght the beginning
of the young monsieurs so tragic tale
and could not forbear to linger till i
heard its end

  do not despair my friend he
patted homers bowed shoulder
gently all looks hopeless i know
but i think there is a reason behind
it all nor is it what you think

 trowbridge my friend he
added his little eyes snapping with
cold fury i damnation think this
business of monsieur abbots aud
that of monsieur norton are bound
up together somehow yes certainly
there is someone or some thing in
this city which stands in urgent need
of eradication and i shall supply
that need-may satan fry me in a pan
with butter and parsnips if i do not
so

  again he turned to homer think
monsieur he urged what hap-
pened before your so charming wife
began to show this remarkable
change consider carefully the
smallest liappening the seemingly
least important thing may guide us
to a solution of the case what by
example did you do for several days
before she manifested the first symp-
tom-even the very night before her
indisposition became patent   

  young abbot took his chin in ms
hand as he bent his thoughts back-
ward i cant recall anything espe-
cially that happened about that
time he answered slowly lets
see four of us went to the theater
that thursday night and stopped at
a night club afterward um yes
something rather queer did happen

there we had a little spat but-

  excellent de grandin inter-
jected this petite querelle it was
about what if you please

  nothing of importance the other
replied there was a queer bilious-
looking fellow sitting alone at a table
across from us and he kept looking
at marjorie i didnt notice him at
first but at last he got on my nerves
and i lose to speak to him marjorie
begged me not to make a scene and
the fellow left a few minutes after-
ward-damn him id have wrung
his neck if id caught him  he ended
savagely

  indeed and for why de gran-
din asked softly

  just before he left the room he
turned and held up a little mirror or
some small round bright object and
flashed a ray from it directly into
marjories eves i made a dash for
mm but hed gone before i could
reach the door

 um de grandin murmured to
himself that is of importance
also he nodded once or twice
thoughtfully then and madame
your wife she said what he asked

 she fussed at me homer re-
turned in an injured voice de-
clared id made a disgraceful scene
and humiliated her and all that kind
of thing next morning she slept late
and was as exhausted as though shed
just risen from a sickbed when she
finally got up

  jules de grandin studied the end of
his cigarette with slow thoughtful
care at last it is fantastic he
murmured but i damn fear it is so
none the less

  yen good monsieur he turned
again to abbot you will oblige us
by acting as though nothing untoward
has occurred at your house i espe-
cially desire that you do not let ma-
dame suspect yon have discovered her
attempts to drug you anon i think
we shall unravel this sorry tangle for
you but it may take time
the brain-thief





nora mcginnis my genial house-
hold factotum laid a sheaf of let-
ters beside my plate when de grandin
and i repaired to the breakfast room
half an hour later

  hullo i remarked heres one

knew hes stopping here

  i mentioned it to the nurse before
we left his house last night   de gran-
din replied open the letter if you
please monsieur norton sleeps late

thing which will prove helpful to us  
i slit the envelope and read

count they say weve been married two

stand it all and i shant try im taking

dragged me to the study where he
motioned me to take up the telephone

sulting-room extension and called

tion was put through

  city mortuary was the curt re-
turn whos speaking

  you have there the bodies of a
young woman and an infant girl-

madame norton and her child de
grandin affirmed rather than asked

 gawd amighty howd you
know who is this came the
startled reply

have the goodness to answer if
you please the frenchman insisted

  yeah weve got em th police
boat fished em outa th river lessn
half an hour ago who th hell is
this

  one who can prove she destroyed
herself while of unsound mind de
grandin returned as he hung up the
receiver

  you see he asked as he re-
entered the study

  no im hanged if i do i shot
back all i understood was that
betty norton had drowned herself
and her baby

  we shall avenge her have no fear
on that score mon vieux de grandin
promised in a low accentless voice
the swine responsible for this shall

die	and die most unpleasantly or may
jules de grandin never again taste
roast gosling and burgundy i swear
it

jules de grandin tossed aside the
copy of villustration he had been
perusing since dinner and glanced at
the diminutive watch strapped to his
wrist   it is time we were going my
friend he informed me be sure
to dress warmly the march wind is
sharp as a scolding womans tongue
tonight

    going   i echoed   where- 

  to monsieur abbots of course
he returned i determined it this
morning  

  you what i demanded well

of all the brass-bound nerve- i

began but kit norton interrupted me

  may i come too sir he asked

    assuredly   the frenchman
nodded i think you may find inter-
est in that which we shall undoubt-
lessly see tonight young monsieur


weird tales

  grumbling but curious i hustled
into a corduroy hunting-outfit high
laced boots and a leather wind-
breaker similarly arrayed de gran-
din and norton joined me in the hall
and at the frenchmans suggestion
we hailed a taxicab and rode to within
a block of abbots house then walked
the remainder of our journey

  it was cold work waiting in the
shadow of the hedge skirting homers
front lawn and i was in momentary
dread of being seen by a passing
policeman and arrested as a suspicious
character but our vigil was at last cut
short by de grandins soft exclama-
tion  atlcndez-vous mes amis you
recognize her

  i peered through the wall of wind-
shaken hedge in time to see a svelte
figure muffled from chin to heels in
fur glide swiftly down the steps and
pause irresolutely at the curb yes
i nodded its marjorie abbot
but-

  trcs bon it is enough de gran-
din cut in turning to flash the light
of his pocket electric torch toward the
comer where our taxi loitered

  the vehicle drove slowly toward us
passed by and slowed down at the
curb where marjorie stood cab
lady hailed the chauffeur the girl
nodded and a moment later we saw
the red eye of the vehicles tail light
blink mockingly at us as it rounded
the comer

  well i exclaimed of all the
treacherous tricks that scoundrel
deliberately passed us by after youd
signaled him and-

  and did precisely as he was in-
structed de grandin supplied with
a chuckle trowbridge my friend
you are a peerless pill-dispenser but
you are sadly lacking in subtlety
consider do we wish to advertise
our presence to madame marjorie
decidedly not what then if our
cab remained in plain sight madame
marjorie could not well fail to see it
and would unquestionably think it

queer if it did not apply for her
patronage had she been forced to
seek another vehicle she would havo
been on her guard and looked con-
stantly behind to see if she were fol-
lowed in such conditions we should
have had satans own time to mark
her destination without being dis-
covered as it is our so excellent
driver conveys her where she desires
to go returns for us and makes the
trip over again yotla eest ires sim-
ple nest-ce-pas

  umph i admitted grudgingly
whats next

  to warn monsieur abbot of our
advent   he returned   he awaits us
i have told him to be prepared

  we crossed the yard and rang
abbots bell but no response came to
our summons despairing of making
the bell heard de grandin hammered
on the door still no answer

  eh bien can he have fallen asleep
in good earnest the frenchman
fumed let us go in to him

  the door was unlatched and we had
no difficulty entering but though we
called repeatedly no answer came to
our hails at length upstairs my
friends the frenchman ordered
our plans seem to have miscarried
but i will not have it so  

  wrapped to the chin in blankets
but fully clothed save for shoes and
jacket homer abbot lay in his bed
his head tilted grotesquely to one side
his heavy respiration proclaiming the
deepness of his slumber

  wake my friend rouse up we
are come  de grandin cried seizing
the sleepers shoulder and giving it
a vigorous shake

  young abbots head rolled flaecidly
from side to side but no sign of con-
sciousness did he give

  once more de grandin shook him
then by damn you will wake
though i kill you in the process he
declared shoving the sleeper so fierce-
ly that he tumbled from the bed his
limbs sprawling uncouthly like the
the brain-thief



arms and legs of a rag-doll from
which the sawdust had been drained

  grand dieu observe the little
frenchman ordered pointing dra-
matically to a tiny spot of red upon
the upper part of homers shirt
sleeve

  hypo i commented as i saw
the telltale stain

  bien oui drugs given by mouth
failing she has made use of injec-
tions de grandin agreed excitedly
quick friend trowbridge time is
priceless to the nearest pharmacy
for strychnia and a syringe if you
please we shall rouse him to accom-
pany us despite all their planning

  i hurried on my errand till my
breath came pantingly returned with
the stimulant in less time than i
should have thought possible and pre-
pared an injection the powerful
medicine acted swiftly and homers
lids fluttered upward almost before
i could withdraw the needle

how now my friend were you
caught napping de grandin asked

  looks that way the other an-
swered i turned in as you sug-
gested and pretended to be sound
asleep but she must have suspected
something shortly after i went to
bed she came in bent over me and
called softly i didnt answer of
course but my lids must have
quivered the way they usually do
when someone looks intently at you
for she bent still closer and kissed me
just as her lips touched mine i felt a
sting in my arm and before i could
let out a yell i was dead to the
world

  exactly precisely quite so the
frenchman agreed now let us de-
part our taxicab has returned

  sure i can go there again the
chauffeur answered de grandins
excited query th place is out th
andover road about five miles-de-
serted as hell on sunday afternoon
too you couldnt miss it once youve
been there

  tres bien azlez-vous-ent

 huh

  let us go let us hasten let us fly
my excellent one my prince of chauf-
feurs time presses and there is five
dollars extra for you if you make

speed

  buddy just you set back an hold
onto your hair   the driver cautioned
watch me earn that five-spot

 he did at a wholly unlawful
speed we raced along the wide smooth
turnpike passing an occasional inter-
urban bus and one or two bootleggers
cars cityward bound with their loads
of conviviality but encountering no
other traffic

the house was rather small of
frame construction and badly in
need of repainting surrounding it
was a rickety paling fence and a
yard of considerable extent densely
overgrown with lilac trees dwarf
cedars and a few straggling rhodo-
dendrons apparently no light
burned inside but de grandin mo-
tioned us forward while he stayed to
pay the chauffeur

 discretion is essential my
friends he eautioned as he joined
us let us proceed with caution
thereupon we dropped behind each
shadowing bush and advanced by a
series of short quick dashes like
infantrymen at skirmish practise

  slowly we circled the house at
length descried a single feeble ray of
light flickering from beneath a drawn
blind and tight-barred shutters the
frenchman glued his eye to the chink
whence the light emanated then drew
back with a shrug of impatience i
can see nothing he admitted de-
jectedly

  we looked at each other in helpless
discomfiture but in a moment the
little man was grinning delightedly
messieurs norton-abbot he de-
manded in a whisper can you emu-
late a cat-two cats-several cats


weird tales

  a cat the youngsters chorused
in amazement

  but certainly a pussy-cat a
kitty de grandin agreed can you
caterwaul and meaul like a duet of
tom-cats enjoying a quarrel

  certainly abbot returned
but-

  there are no buts my friend do
you and monsieur norton repair to
yonder lilac bush and thereupon set
up such a din as might make a dead
man leave his coffin in search of peace
elsewhere continue your concert a
full two minutes then fling a stone
into a distant thicket to simulate
the crashing of departing felines
through the undergrowth remain
utterly quiet for two minutes more
then join me as soundlessly as may
be you understand very well be
off

  grinning broadly abbot and nor-
ton departed to a screen of lilac
bushes and in a moment there rose
such a racket of howls caterwauls
and vicious hisses as might have con-
vinced anyone that two lusty tom-cats
had staged a finish-fight on the lawn

  i rocked with laughter at the ex-
hibition but my mirth was swallowed
in admiration of de grandins strat-
egy as i watched him from under
his leather jacket he drew a long
curve-bladed senegalese knife and fell
to cutting the shutter-slats away as
he worked he thrust a stick of chew-
ing-gum between his teeth and began
masticating furiously the razor-sharp
steel sheared through the rotten
worm-eaten wood almost as if it had
been cheese and in a moment an open-
ing six inches wide by two high had
been made cutting a slat from the
other shutter barring the window he
laid the wooden cleats on the frosty
lawn then slipped the great pigeons-
blood ruby from his finger and
pressed it against the window-pane

  the stone cut through the glass
almost as easily as the knife had
hacked the wood and in a moment a

small circular opening was chopped
from the pane just before the circle
was complete the frenchman took the
gum from his mouth flattened it
against the glass and thrust his finger-
tip into it then cutting the re-
mainder of the circle with the ruby
he nonchalantly lifted out a disk of
glass without a single betraying
tinkle having sounded

  shutters and window having been
drilled through he proceeded to make
a small incision in the linen window-
blind with the tip of his knife there-
by making it possible for us to see
and hear all which went on inside
the lighted room

  a final burst of feline profanity
and a crashing in the bushes by the
fence apprised the world that one of
the struggling cats had quit the field
of honor hotly pursued by his vic-
torious rival and in another moment
abbot and norton joined us

  with upraised finger de grandin
enjoined silence then waved us for-
ward to the observation-slits he had
cut

we viewed the scene within as
though looking through the peep-
hole of a camera obscura an old-
fashioned cannon stove heaped almost
to overflowing with glowing coal
stood in the center of the room and
from the ceiling swung an oil lamp
by one of those complicated pulley
arrangements once common to every
rural dining-room in a rather tat-
tered easy-chair lounged a tall spare
man of indeterminate age a long
cord-belted dressing-gown of paisley
weave covering his dinner clothes his
skin was sallow with a sallowness that
was more than mere pallor there was
a distinctly yellowish cast to it like
new country butter close-cropped
hair of raven blackness crowned his
head as closely as a skull-cap growing
well down over his broad low brow
and seeming to lend an intensity to
the burning searching eyes which
the brain-thief



glowed like twin pools of black ink in
the immobile yellow mask of his face
slim black brows spanned his fore-
head and met forming a sharp down-
ward angle above the bridge of his
thin narrow-nostriled nose there was
neither amusement nor hate nor any
other sign of emotion on his mask-like
face only intense implacable con-
centration as he bent his changeless
stare on the woman standing rigid as
though frozen against the wall oppo-
site him

  -take them off-all he was

saying in a low sibilant voice as we
pressed our eyes to the peep-hole
evidently we arrived in the midst of
a conversation or rather a monolog
for the woman was mute as she was
motionless

 marjorie homer abbot ex-
claimed softly as he recognized his
wife rigid against the wall then

  thats the man who tried to flirt
with her at the supper club the-

  and thats the man isabel and i
saw at the theater the other night-i
mean before i lost my memory kit
norton cut in we were coming
from the theater and i jostled him
when he deliberately got in my way to
peer info isabels face he looked at
me as though hed have liked to mur-
der me but all he did was raise his
hand and flash a big bright ring
before my eyes it dazzled me for a
moment and when i reached out to
grab him by the collar he was gone
he must have-

  silence de grandins sharp
whisper cut short his recital the
seated yellow-faced man was speak-
ing again

  at once he commanded in the
same level toneless voice and i
noticed that his thin lips scarcely
moved as he spoke

  the woman by the wall trembled
as though with a sudden chill but
her hands rose flutteringly to her
throat undid the clasp of her long
fur cloak and threw it back from her

shoulders all the man repeated
tonelessly inexorably

  quickly mechanically she unloosed
the fastenings of her costume in a
moment she was done and stood fac-
ing him still and straight as a statue
carved in ivory arrayed only in the
beauty with which generations of new
jersey forebears had endowed her

  you are slightly rebellious the
seated man remarked we must
cure that wake

  marjorie abbot started as though a
cup of chilled water had been dashed
in her face saw her crumpled gar-
ments on the floor at her feet and
made a wild ineffectual cluteh at the
topmost wisp of silk on the pile of
clothing

  still the girl straightened like
a puppet stretched upright by a
spring but a tortured cry burst from
her even as she stiffened into im-
mobility

  it was a pitiful bleating cry which
wrung my heart once when i was a
little boy i spent a season on an
uncles farm and was given a lamb
for pet all summer i loved and
pampered the little woolly thing till
it became tame and friendly as a
house-dog at autumn came slaughter-
ing-time and with the unsentimental
practicality of country folk they gave
my pet to the itinerant butcher who
came to do the killing never shall i
forget the startled reproachful cry of
that lamb as his confidence and gentle
friendliness betrayed he felt the
gleaming knife cross his throat it
was such a cry of helpless terror and
despair marjorie abbot gave but it
was not repeated

  quiet commanded the yellow-
faced man be motionless be speech-
less but retain full consciousness at
my unspoken command you have left
your silly husband and come to me
you have exposed your body to my
eyes when i ordered it though your
strongest instincts forbade it here-
after you obey my slightest thought


weird tales

you have neither volition nor will of
your own when i command otherwise
you will know what you do and
realize that you act against your de-
sires but you will be powerless to
explain by word or act you will ap-
parently wilfully and wantonly drag
your husbands name and your own
through scandal after scandal you
will use your charm to allure but
never will you make return for what
you receive you will be pitiless heart-
less passionless a woman taking all
giving nothing living only to create
misery and heartbreak for all with
whom you come in contact you
understand   

  only the wide terror-stricken stare
of the motionless nude girls eyes re-
plied but the answer was eloquent

  do not think i can not do this-
that your love for your husband can
withstand my power the man went
on i caused the break between the
fool norton and his wife it was i who
made the baintree girl desert her hus-
band and create a scandal with nor-
ton but they knew nothing of what
they did-i commanded their memo-
ries to sleep and they slept last
night i wakened norton-how the fool
must have squirmed when he saw a
strange woman in his home and
learned all which had happened while
i kept his memory locked in the secret
chamber of my mind last night i
released my hold upon his wife too so
that both awakened in a strange
world separated from the mates they
loved despised by all who knew them
found themselves parents of a child
whose very existence they had not sus-
pected till i released them from my
spell i think we shall find amusement
watching their efforts to adjust them-
selves for the first time his thin
pale lips curved in a snarling smile

  you wonder why i did this to
them-why i do it to you he de-
manded because i hate them hate
you-hate every hypocritical member
of your two-faced race in my coun-

try white men talk morality and
honor then take our women when
they feel inclined abandon them
when they wish in india i could do
nothing the english pigs prevented
it but in france i found a welcome
-they drew no color line there but
received me as a great artist ha-
the frenchmen proved almost as
stupid as your americans but not
quite  nation in the world is com-
posed of such utter fools as you you
welcomed me as a refugee from brit-
ish oppression i am free to work my
will here your dull western minds
are malleable as wax to my superior
will i who can make multitudes be-
lieve they see me cast my rope into
the sky then climb it to the clouds
find the subjection of your wills to
mine less than childs play

  who am i he broke off with
sudden sharpness staring intently at
her answer

  my lord and my master she fal-
tered

  and who are you

  your thing and creature your
less than slave your chattel to do
with as you will my lord

    what is your wish  

  i have no wish no will no desire
no mind save to do as you command

	lord and ruler of my existence
she answered slipping to her knees
laying her hands palm-upward on the
floor then bending forward and beat-
ing her smooth forehead softly on the
rug between them

  it is well resume your clothing
and your duties o monstrous un-
couthness remember from this time
forward you know neither truth nor
honor nor virtue nor fair dealing save
to make mock of them it is under-
stood

  it is understood master again
she struck her brow against the floor
between her supplicatingly out-
stretched hands

  like hell it is with a mad-
dened roar homer abbot smashed
the brain-thief



through the rotting shutters crashed
the window-panes to a hundred frag-
ments and hurled himself into the
superheated room you damned
ape-faced swine he shouted you
might have broken kit norton s home
and made his name a byword all over
town but you dont do it to me 

   he lunged frantically at the slender
form reclining in the shabby arm-
chair unconcerned as though there
had been no interruption his wife
proceeded with the process of don-
ning her flimsy silk undergarments

  ah we have a caller it seems
the seated man remarked pleasantly
he made no move to defend himself
but his sable deep-set eyes narrowed
to mere specks of shining black flame
as he focused them on the intruder

  homer abbot stopped stone-still in
mid-stride as though he had run into
an invisible wall of steel a dazed
half-puzzled half-frightened look
came to his face as he bent every
ounce of energy toward advancing
yet remained fixed as a thing carved
of stone

  you are right my dear sir the
yellow-faced one pursued i shall
not make your name a scandal in the
town-not in the sense you mean at
any rate but concerning your wifes
name-ah that is something different
i shall kill you and command her to
remain here with your body till the
police arrive she will know how you
died but she will not tell oh no
she will not tell for i shall forbid
her and you yourself have heard her
acknowledge my authority

  he laughed soundlessly as he drew
an automatic pistol from the pocket
of his dressing-gown it was one of
those german monstrosities of mur-
derousness built like a miniature
machine-gun which sprays ten bul-
lets from its muzzle at a single pres-
sure of the trigger

  slowly seeming to delight in the
delay he raised the weapon till it
covered abbots heart then

  have you prayed are you pre-
pared to meet the white mans god
all-conquering white man who is so
weak before the commands of my
will he asked if so i shall-

  chapeau dun cochon you shall do
nothing and damnably little of it
jules de grandin shouted as he
launched himself through the broken
window

  the distance between them was
quite eight feet but the french-
man cleared it with the lightning
speed of a famished cat leaping on an
unwary bird before the seated man
could deflect his aim from homer
abbot de grandin was beside him
and the lamplight glittered on the
wide curved blade of his great knife
as he swung it downward saberwise

  through coat sleeve and shirt
sleeve through flesh and bone and
sinew the keen steel cut severing the
mans arm midway between carpus
and elbow as neatly as a surgical
operation might have done

  the hand fell to the carpeted
floor with a thud the fingers clench-
ing in muscular spasm and the pistol
clutched in the severed fist sputtered
a fusillade of futile shots like a bunch
of fhecrackers set off together

  as a spilth of ruby blood spurted
from his severed radial and brachial
arteries a look of stupefaction of in-
credulous wonderment replaced the
grimace of tigerish fury which had
been on the yellow-skinned ones face
for a moment he regarded the bleed-
ing stump and the small almost
femininely dainty hand lying on the
floor with confounded astonishment
then his surprize seemed swallowed
up in mad unreasoning terror in th -
twinkling of an eye he wras changed
from the calm sinister personifica-
tion of the inscrutable east to a
groveling thing-a member of an in-
ferior dominated race trembling and
defenseless before the resistless pur-

ort norus chairman of
the council of suns

as my name rang forth
i was stepping up onto the great
dais at the center of the hall of
suns the roar of dissimilar voices
that had filled that hall a moment
before tlied instantly and from all

    

the thousands of differing forms
gathered here in the great council
of suns of which i was head there
came no sound great plant-men of
capella strange faceless hairy be-
ings from mizar big green-bodied
amphibians from aldebaran-these
and all the countless other unlike
idmond hamilton-

forms about them were silent in that
moment as i stood upon the dais
facing them and as silent were the
two great forms that stood behind
me jhan jal chief of the interstel-
lar patrol of the bird-like races of

sirius his tall body covered with
short feathers his arms and legs end-
ing in great talons with a great
beak between his two dark keen
eyes and mirk en chief of the sci-
ence bureau a big octopus-bodied

                                  


weird tales

vegan his round single-eyed body-
mass the center of his nine great
tentacle-limbs

  but though all these stood silent
in that moment there came through
the halls tall windows an unceasing
roar of tumultuous activity from out-
side through those windows i could
look out across the tumult across
the distant strange black cities
towering into the brilliant white
light of great canopus overhead
and in their streets i could see
swarmed great-headed and bodiless
canopans their thin piping voices
coming to my ears in a dull roar
over those shouting wildly swirling
throngs there soared countless great
ships darting up and out from cano-
pus into space or slanting down out
of space toward the great suns
worlds only a moment i gazed out
over that mighty tumult and then
turned back to the members of the
great council who stood in silence
before me

  members of the council i ad-
dressed them each one of you
knows what peril to our galaxy it is
that has gathered you all here each
one of you knows what tremendous
panic has gripped all the galaxys
suns and worlds each of you knows
in short what terrible doom is even
at this moment destroying our uni-
verse

  they were silent before me as i
paused listening to me in an utter
tension of body and spirit while
from outside there came still the dis-
tant roar of the panic-driven crowds
then i was speaking on

  our galaxy our universe con-
sists as you all know of thousands of
suns great and small gathered to-
gether in a roughly disk-shaped mass
floating here in infinite space upon
the worlds of almost all these suns
exist our races races of dissimilar
beings who yet combined long ago
into our great federation of suns
with its capital here at canopus the
mightiest and most central of all the

galaxys suns for eons our ships
have plied the ways of our universe
from sun to sun for eons the cruis-
ers of our mighty interstellar patrol
have watched and warded the ways
between those suns banded thus
into this mighty federation indeed
our races our suns have come to be
more and more dependent upon each
other for continued existence and
now that great federation of suns
our great galaxy itself is being
broken up destioyed

  	 it was but two days ago that the
first warning of the thing came to us
great deneb at the galaxys edge
was beginning its astronomers re-
ported to move outward into space
with ever-increasing speed deneb
like almost all our suns had moved
always through space yet had kept
always inside the galaxys mass just
as countless bees can each be moving
yet can hold together steadily in a
compact swarm but now it was
clear deneb was doing what never a
sun in our universe had done before
was leaving that universe was mov-
ing out from the galaxy

  hardly had that astounding news
been received by us indeed when
there came from spica far around
the galaxys edge from deneb the
same startling news spica also its
astronomers flashed word was mov-
ing outward into the void of space
and swiftly from other of the outer-
most and inner suns from rigel and
mira and betelgeuse and altair
came the same amazing news that
they also were beginning to move
outward to separate report after
swift report we received in the next
hours from the astronomers of sun
after sun from sirius and algol and
saiph and arcturus and procyon
from myriads upon myriads of
others until by now it is known defi-
nitely that practically every sun in
the galaxy save great canopus
which lies motionless here at the
galaxys center is moving away
from its swarming fellow-suns that
the sun people



the galaxys great swarm of stars is
breaking up as its stars move away
in all directions

  but what caused this outward
movement of all the galaxys suns
that is what we sought first to learn
since it might be that this movement
was but a temporary phenomenon
you know that the galaxys suns
have been held together by their
gravitational attraction toward each
other it is that attraction of sun for
sun that has held them always in the
galaxys disk-like mass regardless
of their own movements in the same
way that chips floating in water will
gather in a mass despite their own
movements if that gravitational at-
traction between the galaxys suns
did not exist they would no longer
be held together the swarm would
disintegrate since besides their
movements the unopposed light-pres-
sure of one sun upon another would
cause them to spread out in all di-
rections if that gravitational at-
traction between the suns of the gal-
axy did not exist that was what
would happen we knew and since
that was happening we knew that in
some way the gravitational attrac-
tion had been nullified

  that indeed was what our sci-
ence bureau soon found to be the
case they found that there were
radiating out through our galaxy
unceasing vibrations of immense
force which were destroying the gravi-
tational pull of our suns upon each
other you know that long ago we
found gravitational attraction to be a
vibratory force whose wave-length or
frequency depends upon the size of
the gravitational body thus gravi-
tation like any other vibratory force
can be destroyed by opposing to its
vibrations other dampening vibra-
tions of equal wave-length and fre-
quency and that we found is what
this strange force this strange vibra-
tion radiating out through our gal-
axy is doing it is annihilating the
pull of our great suns upon each

other the gravitational force of their
worlds is so much lower in frequency
by reason of their far smaller siw
that it is unaffected by the strange
vibrations which are destroying the
attraction of our suns for each other
thus the worlds of each sun cling to
that sun by their own attraction for
it move with that sun still but the
suns themselves no longer attract each
other and thus are spreading outward
from the galaxy hi all directions

 and that outward movement
marks th end of our galaxys mighty
swarm of suns already its countless
stars are spreading outward farther
and farther from each other in all di-
rections slowly now they are moving
outward but ever faster and within
twenty hours more we have calcu-
lated the great outer suns will be so
far out that even were this destroy-
ing vibration removed and the attrac-
tion of our suns for each other re-
stored it would be too late to draw
them back into the galaxys swarm
outward-outward-all are moving
outward save great canopus here at
the center which soon will be left
alone in space where once floated the
great universe of which it was capi-
tal for by then each of the great
suns of that universe will be pursuing
its own way into the great void separ
rated for all time from its fellow-suns
of our galaxy and that it is that has
sent blind terror rolling across all the
peoples of our suns and worlds for
it means the end forever of our
mighty federation of suns the end
forever of our galaxy our universe

i	paused for a moment and a death-
like silence greeted me a silence
more terrible than any shout of fear
and i saw that all eyes were upon me
in an utter tenseness of fear and hope

  we of the council of suns have
gathered here to stand against that
doom even now while it separates for-
ever our swarming suns whence is
coming that great radiating vibration
that is breaking up our universe


weird tales

that is the question that we sought
first to solve working unceasingly
on that question in the first hours af-
ter the alarm our scientists strove to
locate the source of those vibrations
using directional-ray apparatus to
test them from a score of different
suns by charting and combining
itheir findings they have managed to
locate the source of those great vibra-
tions and that source they found
lies at the very center of the galaxys
mightiest and most central sun lies
at the center of great canopus from
far within canopus fires are coming
these vibrations that are wrecking our
galaxy the fact is beyond dispute
whether these are being loosed as
our scientists think by some chance
combination of atomic forces at cano-
pus heart or whether they are loosed
from some other source it is certain
that it is from the great suns center
that those vibrations are coming and
sso to save our universe there is but
one thing that must be done that can
be done and that is to penetrate
idown to canopus center and destroy
if possible whatever great centers of
atomic force have formed there that
are loosing these radiating vibrations
that are destroying our galaxy

  to penetrate down to canopus
center that may seem to you impos-
sible insane to penetrate through the
awful white fires of the galaxys
greatest sun that titanic ball of fire
whose terrific heat is such as to break
up the atomic structures of even the
gases of which it is composed whose
radiated heat alone warms scores of
circling worlds to penetrate to the
great suns center-what cruiser you
will say could do it we have heat-
resistant cruisers indeed cruisers
that can resist high temperatures can
dare the glowing nebulae but these
would be annihilated instantly in the
gigantic suns terrific temperatures
yet down into the heart of canopus
a cruiser must go if the galaxy is to
be saved and knowing that the
chief of the science bureau has in

the last two days turned all its ener-
gies upon the equipment of such a
cruiser and has succeeded but now in
equipping one of the cruisers of the
interstellar patrol to enable it to
plunge unharmed into the great suns
boiling fires

  in that- cruiser has been set a
mechanism which radiates vibrations
tuned to meet and destroy the vibra-
tions of radiant heat for a consider-
able distance around the ship great
projectors have also been set in rows
along the cruisers sides and at its
stem and stem projectors which when
turned on will project broad fan-like
rays the matter-destroying rays used
as weapons by the interstellar patrol
now when this cruiser plunges toward
great canopus it will turn on both the
projectors and the generator of the
heat-destroying vibrations which will
keep any smallest degree of the
mighty suns awful heat from ever
reaching the cruiser and when the
cruiser plunges into the boiling seas
of flaming gases the matter-destroy-
ing rays from the projectors will keep
all those gases from ever touching the
cruiser

  with that vacuum-sheath created
by the projectors about it the cruiser
can plunge into the mighty suns fires
without being ever touched by its
flaming gases and the terrific un-
thinkable heat can not harm it can
not even reach it since the vibrations
of that radiant heat will be damp-
ened nullified destroyed all around it
by the opposing vibrations from the
generator inside the ship thus this
cruiser can plunge into canopus
fires and can unless it encounters
perils of which we know nothing
make its way to the center of the great
sun to those regions of atomic force
which have formed there and are ap-
parently loosing these gravity-destroy-
ing vibrations outward upon our uni-
verse with its great matter-destroy-
ing rays this cruiser can if it finds
them break up and destroy these cen-
ters or regions of atomic force and
the sun people



so save our galaxy from destruction

  but one cruiser we have that can
do that and in that cruiser jhan jal
and mirk en and i are starting
toward the great sun at once we
three-the chairman of the council
of suns the chief of the interstellar
patrol and the chief of the science
bureau-we three are going in this
great hour of peril to penetrate into
great canopus fires and if possible
destroy whatever source there is loos-
ing these vibrations of doom upon us
for unless the attraction of our gal-
axys suns toward each other is re-
stored within twenty hours its outer-
most suns will have moved too far
away to be ever pulled backward into
its swarm so that it is only by find-
ing the source of those vibrations at
the heart of great canopus and by
stopping their radiation outward that
we have any last chance of lifting this
doom that even now is disintegrating
our universe  



canopus edge will be before us in

   minutes jhan jal said turn-
ing toward me already we are well
inside the corona

  i nodded hold straight ahead at
the same speed i told him well
turn on our protective generator and
projectors in a moment

  jhan jals talon-hands held the
cruisers controls steady at my words
keeping it racing straight forward
though the chief of the interstellar
patrol he himself had stood at those
controls from the start of our cruiser
from the hall of suns an hour before
knowing as we all did what mighty
destinies hung upon this single cruis-
er of ours now as he stood there
gazing ahead through the little con-
trol rooms great windows mirk en
and i stood to right and left of him
silent now in a silence that reigned
complete in the control room save for
the never-ceasing throb of the great
mechanisms beneath whose propul-

feion-vibrations our cruiser flung on
through space and the strange half-
heard voices of the crew busy about
those mechanisms we three gazed to-
gether toward the stupendous and
appalling spectacle before us

  for there before us burned in space
the colossal blinding sphere of mighty
canopus greatest and most central of
all the galaxys suns a huge globe of
intensely brilliant white fire to our
stunned eyes it seemed a gigantic wall
of light across all the heavens its su-
pernal brilliance beating in upon us
dazzlingly despite the great light-
repellent shields which had been fitted
over all our cruisers windows to pro-
tect us from that terrific glare fa-
miliar enough to us had been the great
sun always but now it was as though
we saw it for the first time in all its
stupefying splendor for never be-
fore had we or any others approached
so near to it as now we were our little
cruiser having moved at cautious
speed in toward it from the great
world of the hall of suns and now
-penetrating into the stupendous glow-
ing region of the mighty suns corona

  that corona was like a colossal halo
of glowing light that surrounded all
the giant sun and into which our mov-
ing little cruiser was penetrating
seeming no more than some dark tiny
insect in size gazing ahead through
the coronas great glow we could
make out the clearer features of the
huge suns surface before us our win-
dow-shields allowing us to inspect
them though at the expense even then
of dazzled eyes a tremendous sphere
of boiling white fire of incandescent
white gases of unthinkable heat the
mighty sun loomed before us out
from that sphere we could see vast
prominences leaping titanic uprush-
ing jets of incandescent gas capable
each of licking up hundreds of
worlds and upon the suns surface
the photosphere we could see here and
there darker regions great sun-spots
which were each we knew gigantic
whirlpools or maelstroms of the in-


weird tales

candescent gases that composed the
colossal sun

 those gases-and those awful
fires- said jhan jal to pen-
etrate into them-into a sun-its
something never dreamed of in all the
galaxy before

  but we can do it-must do it i
said somewhere inside that sun is
the source of the vibrations that are
breaking up the galaxy and they
must be halted

  but our protective equipment-
our generator and projectors-hadnt
we best turn them on now asked
mirk en this coronas heat is grow-
ing every moment nort norus

  i nodded glancing at a dial whieh
recorded the fact that the temperature
about us had become indeed danger-
ous to our cruiser then i swift-
ly clieked over the series of switches
that controlled the generator beneath
and the projectors about our ship at
once the peculiar loud throbbing of
the generator became audible radiat-
ing out the vibrations whieh were
meeting and destroying the vibrations
of radiant heat directly about us and
as i glanced now at the dial our
cruiser still racing onward it was to
see the temperature that it recorded
swiftly decreasing until in a moment
the temperature just outside our
cruiser was the absolute cold of space-
even as we raced in toward the mighty
sun

  from our ships sides came the low
hissing of the matter-destroying rays
being shot forth unceasingly in broad
fans that sheathed all our ship these
were not being used really since
there was no matter in the great suns
corona but at every moment we were
drawing nearer toward the boiling
white sea of the suns photosphere
onward we were racing jhan japs
great talons steady on the controls
mirk en and i beside him and now
through our window-shields it seemed
that die colossal sphere was only one
tremendous sea of blinding white
thundering fame that walled the

firmament before us outward around
and near to us as we shot on the
mighty prominences of the huge sun
were leaping and we saw that dead
ahead in the giant suns surface there
spun one of the gigantic maelstroms
or whirlpools that are called sun-
spots

  i pointed toward it veer left
jhan jal i told the big sirian
we darent be caught in one of those
sun-spot maelstroms-even with our
protective vaeuum-sheath it would
whirl us about in its great currents
and possibly wreck us

  he swerved the ship to the left of
the great sun-spots maelstrom of un-
thinkable fires a whirlpool of flaming
gases that extended far beneath the
surface we knew and that could have
engulfed countless worlds and now
there were whirling about us great
masses of glowing vapors vapors that
were themselves of tremendous heat
and that were composed of iron and
calcium and sodium and many other
metals existing in vapor form only
here in the tremendous temperatures
of great canopus through those
vapor-masses our eruiser was shooting
an unharmed though its protective
rays keeping its vacuum always about
it its generators vibrations repelling
and nullifyingthe terrible radiant
heat from all about it onward we
shot until i saw with pounding heart
that within minutes we would be
plunging into the terrible fires of the
mighty sun itself

  nearer-nearer-we were racing
toward the surface a titanic upright
sea of boiling white flame and then
mirk en cried out suddenly pointed
ahead from that surface a giant
prominence was shooting was rushing
hi an instant all about us no sound
came from it to us across our vaeuum-
sheath but as it caught our cruiser it
whirled it this way and that with
wild terrific power for though the
gases of that prominence did not
touch the cruiser itself by reason of
its vaeuum-sheath their swift rush of
the sun people



tremendous matter-masses exerted a
gravitational attraction upon our little
ship and tossed it this way and that
in their grip i heard hoarse cries
from the crew beneath glimpsed great
jhan jal holding our ships stem
grimly ahead even in the grip of that
colossal out-rushing prominence and
then it had receded and we were hum-
ming on toward the surface of mighty
canopus but now it lay just before
us an awful ocean of dazzling white
fire the terrible and gigantic sun-
spot maelstrom away to our right
and then our ship had shot into that
boiling white sea of flame was plung-
ing into canopus awful fires toward
its heart

stunned blinded overwhelmed it
was in that moment as though all
about us was only a titanic rushing of
colossal masses of fire a wild and
ceaseless fluxing of awful floods of
flame about our cruiser gripped and
tossed this way and that by rushing
masses of incandescent gases i was
aware in a moment that jhan jal
had kept the cruisers stem still for-
ward and that we were plunging
farther and farther into those flames
swaying and pitching from side to
side but racing steadily onward
steady around our ship there hung
the vacuum-sheath that kept from us
the destroying fires and steady be-
neath throbbed the generator whose
vibrations repelled the terrible heat
from all about us were either of
those protections to fail suddenly i
knew our cruiser and all within it
would vanish in a split-second in one
single blast of fire changed into va-
pors by the awful heat of the incan-
descent masses into which we were
plunging

  on-on-still we were plunging
toward the great suns center mirk
en and i steadying ourselves beside
jhan jal as our cruiser rushed on
into canopus thundering fires great
feathered sirian octopus-like vegan
erect earth-man-surely trio strange

enough did we make as we plunged on
in that fearful journey the like of
which none in the galaxy had ever
made before on-on-and now it
seemed that the wild rush of awful
flame-masses became suddenly swifter
more awful in their thunderous rush
about us became even more blinding
even more unthinkable in heat

  the photosphere cried jhan
jal beside me   weve passed through
the photosphere

  hold straight on i shouted
weve got to reach the center

  now we were reeling on into the
wild fires of the interior whose tem-
perature ail about us now i knew
was countless thousands of degrees
on into that interior we were rushing
plunging through canopus titanic
inferno with only our immaterial heat-
destroying vibrations and the slender
vacuum-sheath about our ship to pro-
tect it from annihilation in those aw-
ful fires

  on and on-all things in the uni-
verse seemed to have dissolved into a
single mighty flood of rushing flame
through which our ship was endlessly
battling beside me jhan jal was
braced strongly against the controls
holding them in a grasp of iron with
his great talons keeping our cruiser
heading onward despite all the rush-
ing currents of fire that surged about
us and made our ship pitch and sway
crazily to his right mirk en held
with his great octopus-tentacles to the
control standards gazing ahead sted-
fastly at the awful seas of fire through
which we rushed while i braced be-
side jhan jal watched tensely the
dials before us with loud in my ears
now the steady throbbing of our gen-
erator and the hissing of our rays
which were alone preserving us from
a fearful death and the cries of our
crew beneath

  by now i knew we were deep be-
neath the surface and since our pro-
tective equipment seemed functioning
perfectly my hopes that we might
attain the great suns center grew


weird tales

stronger but in the very next mo-
ment panic stabbed lightning-like
across those hopes for our cruiser
was suddenly gripped as though by a
gigantic hand was whirled away
blindly through the fires as though
by colossal forces jhan jal and mirk
en and myself being flung to the con-
trol rooms end by that wild swift
reeling of our ship and as the ship
spun crazily in the grasp of the colos-
sal currents of fire as the control
rooms walls and floor and ceil-
ing seemed revolving lightning-like
around us as we clutched in vain for
holds upon it i heard jhan jals
deep despairing cry

  a sun-spot he cried weve
run into one of the titanic maelstroms
beneath the surface

  even in that terrible instant the
meaning of the sirians cry passed
through my ears to my brain in a re-
vealing flash of terror a sun-spots
mighty maelstrom-and we had blun-
dered into it here far beneath the sur-
face for we knew that the giant
whirlpools of the great sun-spots did
extend far into the suns interior and
plunging into those interior fires we
had blundered into the terrific whirl-
ing currents of that awful maelstrom
of boiling gases now gripped gravi-
tationally by the titanic currents of
the whirling maelstrom our cruiser
was spun about like a chip spinning
in a maelstrom of water whirled
about by those colossal currents with
terrific speed and force

  flung against the control rooms
walls by the cruisers terrible gyra-
tions i heard from beneath the wild
cries of our crews dissimilar mem-
bers the hoarse shouts of jhan jal
and mirk en beside me the metallic
straining and drawing of the cruisers
walls as they yielded a little to the
terrific forces which were whirling
the ship about with every moment
the cruiser was being whirled at great-
er and greater speed around and
downward and i guessed that it was
nearing the narrowing bottom of the

gigantic maelstrom far beneath the
surface not for long could our ship
spin thus in the grip of that colossal
maelstrom i knew and resist its ter-
rific forces for though our gener-
ators heat - destroying vibrations
throbbed forth still though the hissing
rays kept about our ship still its
vacuum sheath it seemed to my ears
in that wild moment that the gener-
ators throbbing had faltered a little
beneath this wild whirling were that
generator to halt for but a fractional
instant i knew that instant would see
us resolved into vapors and unless
we won free of the terrible sun-spots
whirling depths the generator could
not much longer function it was
clear

  the thought spurred me to wild
efforts to reach the controls as we
were tossed about the control room
twice i grippedthem and was torn
from my hold and then as for the
third time i grasped them i reached
back caught jhan jal who was roll-
ing beside me pulled him to me and
then he caught the levers in his grasp
and with my hands and mirk ens
great tentacles bracing him strove to
bring our ship to a level keel in the
whirling fires to win out of the awful
whirlpool slowly foot by foot we
fought those whirling currents and
foot by foot edged out of them until
at last with the last of the cruiseris
power it seemed we had won clear
and were plunging onward again into
the interior of mighty canopus

we drew great breaths as we won
out of that perilous maelstrom
and i found myself trembling from
the reaction but now as we plunged
still on and on i estimated that we
weie already far in great canopus
interior it was from somewhere at
the center we knew from whatever
strange regions of atomic force might
lie there that there were radiating
the vibrations that were breaking up
our galaxy and now jhan jal and
mirk en and i began to wratch for
the sun people



the appearance of such regions set
up before me were three of those
directional-ray inst ruments with which
our scientists had determined the ori-
gin of the great vibrations and i saw
now from those instruments that the
point of origin lay not far ahead that
we must be already almost in toward
canopus center the mighty sun-
spot maelstrom had whiiled us far in
i knew and so we watched excitedly
as we plunged through the rushing
fires mirk en keeping his gaze upon
the radio-active recording-instruments
which would register the nearness of
any such atomic force regions as those
for which we searched

  upon those instruments though
showed no sign of the existence of
such regions yet my own instruments
showed unmistakably that with every
moment we were approaching the
strange vibrations origin the thing
was inexplicable and as we shot on
and on already almost to the center
of the mighty sun as i guessed it be-
came even stranger to us for still there
were no indications of atomic force
regions ahead had our terrible jour-
ney into canopus central fires been
in vain it could not be i tried to
reassure myself since my dials showed
the vibrations origin close ahead
and suddenly a still stranger thing
obtruded itself upon our attention
and that was the fact that around us
the fires were becoming denser slower-
moving our temperature dials show-
ing them to be growing also somewhat
cooler those fires around us were
like the surface-layer or photosphere
of canopus into which we had first
phuiged

  a photosphere here at the great
sun s heart even as we stared stupe-
fiedly at those fires through which we
rushed i saw from the direction dials
that the origin of the vibrations that
we sought was directly ahead now
tensely i gazed forward as we shot
through the wliite fires hoping to
glimpse the atomic regions from
which those vibrations came then

suddenly breath-takingly our ship
had rushed out of its white fires and

into space - a great space that
stretched before us a tremendous
white-lit space encircled on all sides
by the rushing fires of colossal cano-
pus around it

  a tremendous space here at cano-
pus center but even as we stared in
stupefaction we saw a thing more
stunning saw that within this space
there revolved a great ring of a score
of spherical worlds that ring of
worlds moved almost at the edge of
the mighty globular space almost
touching it seemed the encircling
white fires of canopus and as i saw
that now the direction-arrows of the
dials pointed toward those woilds i
uttered a great cry of sudden under-
standing

  these worlds i cried these
worlds at canopus center its from
them that the gravitation-destroying
vibrations arc radiating-the vibra-
tions that are breaking up our uni-
verse



r-phese worlds the source of the
great vibrations cried jhan
jal but how can this great space-
these worlds-exist here at canopus
center

  and what upon those worlds is
radiating those vibrations    exclaimed
mirk en here at the heart of
canopus it seems are space and
worlds and-peoples of those worlds   

  we stared toward the vegan star-
tled by that suggestion and then i
motioned toward the nearest of the
great ring of worlds there is but
one thing to do-to reconnoiter them
whatever is upon them it is certain
that they are the origin of the vibra-
tions

  jhan jal swerved over the con-
trols sending our ship humming
toward the nearest of that great ring
of circling planets those worlds we
saw moved around always in that
same ring formation inside this hoi-


weird tales

low space very close to the mighty
walls of wthite fire that encircled them
so close indeed that they seemed al-
most on the point of plunging inside
those fires all of the score of worlds
seemed of the same approximate size
and it was toward the whole ring of
them and not any one that the direc-
tion-dials pointed which thus indi-
cated all of them as the source of the
vibrations that were breaking up our
wthole galaxy

  as wre hummed through the white-
lit space toward that nearest world i
was gazing about and could see that
this tremendous hollow at canopus
heart while of great size and able to
hold hundreds of worlds like those
that moved writhin it was yet not
large when compared to the fiery mass
of the great sun about it down
through that titanic mass of fires we
had penetrated to this hollow with our
cruiser the first in all the galaxy ever
to dream of its existence here at the
great suns heart and now i reached
forth and turned off the generator
and the hissing ray-sheath turning
then to the mouthpiece before me and
briefly apprising the crew beneath to
keep watchfully to their stations at
the cruisers propulsion-mechanisms
and ray-tubes

 by that time the world toward
which we were heading wtas looming
large before us a great sphere gleam-
ing oddly in the light of the encir-
cling white fires beside it moving
along just inside those rushing fires
it seemed with the great ring of its
fellow worlds high above it wo
soared circled once or twice and
then were dropping smoothly down in
watchful broad spirals jhan jal and
mirk en and i gazed wratchfully
itoward its surface and then suddenly
the big sirian uttered a lowr exclama-
tion and his talons upon the controls
brought our cruiser abruptly to a
halt at the same moment as he mirk
en and i had glimpsed clearly the
features of the gleaming worlds sur-
face a few thousand feet below and

as we gazed down now with him mirk
ens voice was echoing our thoughts

  a peopled world as i suspected
the gieat vegan exclaimed a peo-
pled world-here at canopus heart

  a peopled world it was indeed
that lay beneath us a wrorld whose
surface gleamed so oddly because al-
most every square yard of it wtas
paved with white metal that reflected
back brightly the intense brilliance of
the white fires that encircled these
worlds and here and there rose
structures of the same white metal
great white-gleaming cubes of giant
dimensions not crowded together
but set here and there at regular in-
tervals over this worlds surface with
great open spaces between them were
those white-gleaming cubes here and
there through the air-for air it was
now into which our cruiser had
dropped-there moved from building
to building what seemed square plat-
forms of the same white metal flitting
smoothly above this world and upon
those squares and upon the metal
paving beneath we could glimpse the
race that peopled this wrorld

  and that race those creatures were
themselves cube-creatures each of
them wtas a great cube of white flesh
the height of a tall man a cube sup-
ported by four powerful flesh-limbs
one at each comer of its cube-like
body from the four upper comers
in the same way there branched four
powerful arms while in each of the
four sides of the cube-like body was
set a single eye and in one of those
sides also a small mouth-opening
cube-creatures i saw even as we
stared in amazement at them that it
must have been because of the cube-
sliape of their own bodies that these
creatures had constructed their build-
ings and almost all else upon their
world in the same shape unconscious-
ly following the design of their own
strange bodies and in ceaseless
streams and groups they were mov-
ing there beneath our hovering
cruiser
the sun people



  but that square of green force
cried mirk en pointing across the
strange worlds gleaming metal sur-
face you see it-that square of
green light there

    green force  i exclaimed gazing
toward where he pointed and its
toward that square and toward the
other worlds that our direction dials
point that green force it is then
that is radiating the vibrations out
into our galaxy  

  for there far across that worlds
surface from us there was set flush
into the metal paving between the
great cube-buildings a giant square of
glowing green light unceasingly it
glowed a deep strange glow that even
rto our eyes seemed more force than
light and we saw that it faced out
toward and through the encircling
fires that the gravitation-destroying
vibrations were thus penetrating
through the-fires of colossal canopus
all about these worlds and destroying
the attraction of all the galaxys suns
for each other it was the strange
cube-creatures of these worlds at
canopus heart therefore and not
any regions of atomic force that were
sending out the vibrations that al-
ready were wrecking our galaxy

  but why i think that was the
question that throbbed most intensely
through our brains as we stared ap-
palled down toward that significant
square of glowing green force why
should these cube-creatures here at
the center of canopus and separated
forever by its fires from the outer gal-
axy never even dreamed of by the
peoples of the galaxy-why should
they want to break up the galaxy
around canopus what strange dark
plan had caused them to send forth
the vibrations that were causing the
suns to leave our universe to break
up that swam forever as they moved
into outer space the thing was in-
comprehensible and jhan jal was
turning toward me as perplexed as
myself

  that great square of green force

it is that is releasing part of the vibra-
tions out upon our galaxy he said
but then there must be more of
them-on the others of these worlds
nort norus

  i nodded swiftly there must be
i said a great square of glowing
force upon each world possibly
though i see no control for them but
the next world-well go on to it and

see-

  in a moment our cruiser had shot
up again and was rocketing out from
the atmosphere of that world toward
the next through the space that sepa-
rated them swiftly that next world
in the ring was looming in view as we
hummed toward it seeming as its
gleaming surface largened before us
to be exactly like the first the great
white-gleaming cube-buildings the
squares moving to and fro from build-
ing to building the strange cube-
creatures that moved here and there
on squares and on the metal paving-
all were the same as on the first world
the same too was the great square of
glowing green force set in the metal
paving and we saw that this green
force-square by reason of its worlds
altered position in the great ring
pointed out through canopus fires in
a slightly different direction releas-
ing its vibrations out over the galaxy
at a different angle

  stupefied almost unbelieving we
stared and then were moving on
toward the third world in the great
ring spiraling down through its at-
mosphere toward it in the same way
at first glance all seemed the same
there as on the first two worlds cube-
creatures and buildings and flying
squares and giant square of green
force appearing a replica of the
others but as we gazed down from
our cruisers control room mirk en
pointed suddenly toward something
beside the great square of green force
something small and gleaming which
we could but vaguely glimpse at
once jhan jal was sending the
cruiser lower toward it lower with our


weird tales

eyes riveted upon it until we had
halted but a few hundred feet above
the flying squares below and from
that height we saw that it was a small
white-metal cube-structure beside the
giant inset square of green force a
small gleaming cube-structure raised
on four slender metal limbs above the
level of the force-square and filled
we could see through its open door
with panel upon panel of strange-
appearing instruments and switches
among which moved a half-dozen
watching cube-creatures

  the central control i cried it
can only be the central switch-box of
the great squares of radiating green
force on all this ring of worlds-the
switches that control the radiation
outward through the galaxy of the
great gravitation-destroying wave

  but look beneath nort norus
the squares-the cube-creatures-
thyeve seen us theyre coming up
toward us

jhan jais cry drove through my
brain like a stiletto of sound and
as i glanced away from the central
switch i saw that beneath us the
swarming squares were swiftly rising
the eyes of their cube-creature occu-
pants turned up toward us from far
away over the gleaming surface those
squares were leaping up through the
air in scores and hundreds and as
they sped upward from the foremost
of them from bulges near the edges
of those metal squares there shot
toward us slender beams of green
light that seemed the same as those
great glowing squares of green force
which radiated the gravitation-de-
stroying vibrations

  up jhan jal  i cried theyre
coming from the side too-theyre
trying to get above us

  for even as jhan jal flung open
the controls and sent our cruiser
whirling steeply upward i saw that
ithe squares rushing toward us from
ithe sides were whirling up in a sharp
slant in an effort to cut off our escape

to catch us between themselves and
the uprushing squares from below
up we flashed and then from the
squares beneath that had leaped to
within striking distance there stabbed
toward us a score or more of the
glowing green beams but at that mo-
ment jhan jal jerked our ship over
in a wild reel sidewise through the
air and the green beams drove by us
to strike the squares rushing above
us

  as they struck we saw those squares
crumble as though compressed sud-
denly from all around by a gigantic
grasp and fall suddenly to the sur-
face of the world below even in that
wild instant as our cruiser reeled
away i realized what had happened
realized that those green beams were
of the same gravitation-destroying
power as the great green squares of
force that were disintegrating all our
galaxy striking those squares above
us they had instantly cut off from
them all gravitational forces from
about them and since those squares
like all other things in this world and
in any world had been constructed
to meet the gravitational pull of the
world beneath it the sudden complete
removal of that pull so affected them
as to make them collapse and crumple
meiely from their own interior
stresses

  now though as our cruiser shot
sidewise and upward the green beams
of the squares beneath were leaping
up again and as we dodged them
again by jerking to one side i shouted
a swift order into the mouthpiece be-
fore me the next moment there
stabbed down from our cruisers ray-
tubes the deadly crimson rays of the
interstellar patrol those terrific rays
which wipe from existence all matter
they touch by changing it from a
matter-vibration in the ether to a
light-vibration they shot down like
stabbing swords of crimson light
among the swarms of upwhirling
squares beneath us and as there broke
and burst across those swarms flare
the sun people



upon flare of fountaining red bril-
liance dozens of those squares were
flashed into annihilation i heard the
hoarse shouts of jhan jal and mirk
en beside me at that and the high-
pitched cries of our ray-erews be-
neath but swiftly the uprushing
squares despite our lightning-leaping
crimson rays were coming up after
us overtaking us

  straight up i cried to jhan
jal were almost out of this worlds
atmosphere and they cant leave it on
those squares  

  already we were shooting up
through the last of that atmosphere
and now as we flashed up into empty
space the thundering wall of white
flame of great canopus encircling us
ahead and above us we saw the pur-
suing hordes of squares slowing halt-
ing beneath but even as we seemed
safe from pursuit the cube-creatures
upon those squares were swiftly don-
ning gleaming metallic and flexible
suits in another moment the cube-
creatures were rushing up once more
after us rushing up from their
worlds atmosphere into the empti-
ness of space

  theyve put on metal suits that
protect them from the cold and air-
lessness of space exclaimed mirk
en theyre coming after us

  on into canopus fires then i
cried its the one way to escape
them

  and with its utmost speed our cruis-
er shot onward toward those roaring
white encircling flames from which an
hour ago we had emerged into this
great space close behind us were the
pursuing squares once more now and
again their green glowing beams and
our crimson rays were crossing and
clashing as they shot up after us pur-
suit and flight of inexpressible
strangeness was that pursuit by
strange eube-creatures who were
wrecking our galaxy and flight on
our part into the awful fires of the
mighty sun already i had turned on
our generator of heat-nullifying vi-

brations our ray-projectors that kept
the vacuum sheath about our ship
but now though those white fires were
close ahead the pursuing squares
were closer behind a last burst of
speed a last blast of green beams
loosed from just behind us and then
we had plunged once more into great
canopus rushing fires

  well wait here inside the sun un-
til theyve given up the pursuit i
told the others as our ship plunged
on then we can make our way back
to that world-to the central switch-
cube

  so bringing the cruiser to a halt
we hung motionless in the swirling
seas of fire our generator and vacuum
sheath protecting us perfectly from
the awful heat and flame for minute
after long minute we hung there
knowing that if we emerged too soon
the cube-creatures squares would still
be awaiting us time was precious to
us we knew for already had passed
almost half of the twenty hours that
had remained to us before the gal-
axys outmost suns would have passed
outside its swarm forever and we
must destroy that great vibration
which was loosing those suns before
the twentieth hour ended if the gal-
axys break-up was to be halted

  jhan jal remained grimly silent
at the controls mirk en and i going
down now through the cruisers ray-
rooms and motor-rooms inspecting
the propulsion mechanisms and espe-
cially the generator and ray-projectors
that kept us from annihilation in the
fires that thundered about us at last
we returned to the control room and
having hung for two hours inside the
suns fires began to move hi again
toward the central great space

  on we plunged and then broke out
into that space again its great ring of
worlds before us no cube-creatures
on their squares were in sight before
us though and jhan jal and mirk
en and i breathed with heartfelt re-
lief at the sight but abruptly at that
moment something hissed and swung


weird tales

around our cruiser from behind we
whirled about behind us had crept
upon us three great squares close to
the wall of fires one of which had
thrown around our ship a great band
of flexible metal that pinioned our
cruiser to that square while from
right and left the other two great
squares crowded with cube-crcaturcs
were rushing upon us



captured i ciied wildly

  v theyve lain in wait for us-
have eaptuied us and our cruiser

  not yet shouted jhan jal
those other two squares-look

  for at the very moment that we
became first aware of the rush of
those two squares from either side
upon us there had come a swift hiss-
ing from beneath and then out from
our cruisers sides there had driven
to right and left a half-dozen bril-
liant crimson beams the rays of our
ray-crews beneath who were not to
be taken unawares even by such a
surprize as this in the next moment
those onrushing squares were mere
bursting flares of crimson light but
the square that held us by the great
flexible metal band had drawn us
against itself and we dared not loose
our rays upon it for they would
have annihilated our own ship and
as we realized that fact there came
upon our ships side upon the spaee-
door in its hull a terrific hammering
and clanging

  the cube-creatures on that
square yelled mirk en theyre
trying to break inside-to board
us

  try to break loose from them
jhan jal i cried try to break
the band that holds us to them

  but already the great sirian had
flung open the controls to their
utmost had sent our ship leaping
forward with all the force of its
throbbing mechanisms but it could
not break thus from the hold of the

great square beside us tlie thick
broad metal band that it had flung
around us holding our cruiser to it
as though in the grip of a giant and
out on that square massed against
the space-door of our cruiser were
crowding the cube-creatures in their
strange metal stuts hammering with
metal tools upon our space-door
striving with all their power to break
or pry it open to pour in upon us
they dared not use their gieen
beams any more than we dared use
our crimson rays but once inside the
cruiser they meant to sweep us from
existence it was clear a moment
more and they would have battered
through the great door-and then i
shouted into the mouthpiece to my
two friends

  to the hull space-door quick 
shouted well use our own space-
suits to hold them out-to fight it
out with them

  and with mirk en and jhan jal
racing beside me the big sirian
laughing a little from sheer joy of
battle we were rushing down from
the control room into the ray-room
from which the big space-door
opened the clangor inside that room
from the creatures beating against
it outside was terrific but in that
moment we paid it but small atten-
tion all our crew rushing into the
room and throwing themselves into
the space-suits which were in every
cruiser of the interstellar patrol
for each of our dissimilar forms a
specially shaped spaee-suit was pro-
vided and instantly we were don-
ning those suits they were of flex-
ible metal much like those used by
the cube-creatures but having trans-
parent-metal vision-plates near the
head of each each suit providing a
perfect insulation against the cold
and airlessness of space another
moment and we were almost all in
our suits great mirk en struggling
last of all into his big nine-tentacled
suit and then i flung suddenly open
the great space-door against which
the sun people



the things outside hammered as the
air of the ray-room rushed out into
space our scores of followers with
jhan jal and mirk en and me at
their head were rushing out upon
the hordes of cube-creatures on the
square fastened to our cruiser

  the next instant we were whirling
across that square with those crea-
tures in the wildest hand-to-hand
battle that i have ever experienced
cube-creatures in scores and scores
of dissimilar beings drawn from
every peopled star in the galaxy
almost we struggled in mad combat
on the slippery metal surface of the
great square hanging there in empty
space away to the right there spun
the nearest of the great ring of
worlds and to our left and all about
us flamed the awful barrier of flame
that was the giant sun itself and
we creatures there on the squares
surface each in his space-suit were
engaged in a wild battle whose in-
tensity was such as to make us forget
utterly in that moment the cosmic
and awful panorama about us

  gripped on first rushing forth by
two of the cube-creatures i felt their
eight great arms swiftly grasping me
as i endeavored with wild blows to
thrust them back beneath those
blows their cube-like bodies flinched
but as we whirled they gripped me
tighter and i saw that they were try-
ing to tear open the space-suit i wore
-were trying to annihilate me in-
stantly by allowing the air generated
automatically inside it to rush out
into space causing me to perish
instantly but even as they grasped
it i had gripped a metal tool that was
knocking about on the squares sur-
face beneath me in the wild melee of
combat that surrounded us and
brought that sharp-edged tool down
upon their own flexible metal suits in
two swift great blows as its sharp
end pierced through those suits i felt
their grasp on me relax vanish saw
them crumple to the squares surface
dead slain instantly by the cold of

space as their suits were penetrated

  but about me now were rushing
a half-dozen more of the cube-crea-
tures three of whom had grasped me
again and as i struggled fiercely
against those in turn i saw that all
about me was still raging furiously
this strange and fearful battle
great jhan jal i saw was towering
erect in his metal suit at the center
of a half-dozen of the cube-creatures
sending them reeling back from him
with swift raking blows of his great
taloned arms but most terrible of
all in that grim combat was mirk
en the great octopus-like vegan
had gripped the squares edge firmly
with two of his mighty tentacles and
now with the other seven of those ten-
tacle-arms was gripping cube-creature
after cube-creature in the scores that
whirled about him was slamming
them down upon the squares surface
with terrific force his mighty arms
cutting paths of death through the
throngs that swirled about him

  and over all the surface of the
square the scores of our crew out-
numbered almost two to one as they
were were battling furiously with
the great cube-creatures the strange
unlike forms of our crews members
in their metal space-suits the masses
of great cube-creatures --these
whirled around me in a mad melee
in which the only things clear to me
were the three great monsters with
whom i was battling and who had
borne me down now to my knees as
i struck furiously at them with fast-
waning strength one of them
crumpled and dropped dead as my
metal tool-weapon pierced through
his suit but the other two had
gripped me firmly about the body
now and for minutes-minutes in
which i was conscious only of the
wild roar of combat about us the
swaying to and fro of battling forms
around me-i struggled with those
two great creatures they gradually
bore me down and then both grip-
ping my body were endeavoring


weird tales

with all their strength to tear the
round head-case loose from my space-
suit

  i felt the metal of that suit giving
knew that another moment would
see instant death for me as the suit
was torn open and then there was
a rush of movement beyond the two
things and they were gripped
abruptly by swift-eoiling metal-clad
tentacles that raised them high and
slammed them down upon the square
with terrible force where they lay
broken and dead i staggered to my
feet then and saw that it was mirk
en who had saved me and i saw
too that about us on the square the
combat with the cube-creatures was
almost over nearly all of them hav-
ing been killed while but half of our
crew was left around us

it was mirk ens great fighting-
power that more than aught else
had turned the scale for us against
the great odds we had faced and
now with mirk en and jhan jal i
wras leaping with our crews remain-
ing members upon the dozen remain-
ing cube-creatures fiercely they
fought us still but we gave them no
quarter and in a few moments all of
them but one had been slain by us
mirk en raising that one cube-erea-
ture upward to whirl him down to
death also as he did so though a
sudden idea flashed across my mind
and i grasped the great vegans
tentacle-ann motioned to him to
take the cube-creature into our
cruiser he paused then did so
jhan jal and i and the remaining
members of our crew still in our
space-suits following him into the
cruiser the square was littered now
with the tumbled dead of our crew
and of the cube-creatures alike all
still in their metal suits

  as we entered our cruiser slam-
ming shut the space-door and turn-
ing on the air-control that filled the
ray-room again with air we swiftly

doffed our heavy space-suits and i
spoke swiftly to jhan jal and mirk
en this captured cube-creature
i told them from him we can
learn maybe how best to halt this
vibration his race is loosing outward
through the galaxy

  mirk en nodded glancing at the
cube-creature whose own metal suit
had been ripped off and who stood
guarded now beside us we should
be able to communicate with him
with the thought-speech machine
nort norus he said at least
well try it

  the great vegan science chief
uttered an order and in a moment
one of our crew had brought from
another of the cruisers rooms the
thought-speech machine a compact
metal cabinet from which five flat
metal bands led ending in shining
little clips it was this mechanism
that had been used always among
the galaxys races for communication
with those races who were without
audible speech since this mechanism
was one that mechanically converted
thought into clear speech in our own
language by catching and amplify-
ing the brains thought-currents and
causing them to actuate a cor-
responding series of word-speakers
whether it would work with a crea-
ture so alien to us as the cube-crea-
ture we did not know but there was
a chance that it might and so mirk
en swiftly attached the mechanisms
bands to the creatures body making
five small incisions in that body after
some study of it and attaching the
clips of the bands to the nerve-cen-
ters inside then reversing the
machines control so that speech into
it avas reproduced in the creatures
brain as thought i spoke clearly into
the cabinets opening

  you are captured and have but
one chance for life i said and
that is to tell us your races purpose
in loosing those gravitation-destroy-
the sun people



ing vibrations and to tell us how
best they can be turned off  

  the cube-creatures strange dark
eyes one in each side of him
widened as i spoke thus and i knew
from that that the machine had re-
produced my speech as thought in
his brain i reversed the mechan-
isms control and in a moment the
answer came in the clear metallic
tones of the mechanism the cube-
creatures thought translated by the
mechanism into our speech

  you will spare me if i tell you
that he asked and quickly i re-
plied in the affirmative then for a
moment the cube-creature surveyed
us with his inscrutable strange eyes
while mirk en and jhan jal and i
watched him and then he was speak-
ing or rather the mechanism con-
nected to him was speaking to us his
thoughts and as from time to time
that mechanism went silent for a
brief instant we knew it was because
certain thoughts of this alien crea-
ture had no equivalent in our
speech

  it is to ward off doom from our-
selves the metallic voice was say-
ing   that we have loosed doom upon
your galaxy for during all the ages
that you peoples of the outer uni-
verse have existed on the worlds
around your stars the stars around
this mighty central sun we cube-
creatures we sun-peonles have
existed here inside it this mighty
sun of canopus-the thought-
speech machine so rendered his own
name for the great sun-this great
sun of canopus has always had this
tremendous hollow here at its heart
it was when the mighty sun formed
first out of the condensing nebulae
that this hollow at its heart formed
because the light-pressure inward of
the colossal sun around it would
allow it to condense no further and
so this great hollow here a small one
compared to the colossal suns mass
but large in itself has existed

always unknown to you of the outer
universe

  in this hollow there swirled at
first the chance fragments of great
incandescent gases that had broken
into it from the condensing sun
around it and these gases because of
their comparatively small quantity
soon cooled hardened into molten
masses of matter which in turn were
drawn by their own gravitational at-
traction for each other into worlds
into a score of worlds turning in a
compact ring at the very center of
this hollow

  these inner planets of canopus
being of the same physical constitu-
tion as its outer ones it is not sur-
prizing that at last upon them even
as upon the outer ones there arose
life for even as the outer planets
these inner worlds had air and
water and though they received
great heat from canopus terrible
fires all around them that heat was
not too great for you know that
a photosphere will form over a great
suns surface a denser layer that
impedes somewhat the interior light
and heat from radiating outward
and in the same way a photosphere
layer had formed at canopus inner
surface around the great hollow it
enclosed this kept the heat radiated
into that hollow from being so great
as to scorch life from its worlds and
so life flourished and came at last
to its culminating species in us cube-
creatures we races with our great-
er knowledge and science came at
last to hold unchallenged all the
score of canopus inner worlds

  we built our great metal cube-
buildings paving even the surface
of our worlds between those build-
ings with metal we devised the
squares on which we can fly through
air or space and the metal suits that
protect us in moving through space
and that allow us to move easily
from one of our worlds to another
through the colossal fires about us


weird tales

we could not pierce but we did find
a way to send a light-ray unbent and
unchanged through the great suns
terrifie light and heat and force and
by means of that way we were able
to look out upon the galaxy of suns
that was gathered about our own
we saw the inhabitants of those suns
rising in civilization saw their great
interstellar wars giving way to a
confederation of all their peoples
saw them fighting back the vast
perils that crowded from time to
time upon them but never we saw
did they ever dream of the existence
of our worlds and races here at the
center of their greatest sun and never
did we desire to leave our home here
where we were safe we thought
from all dangrs

  but at last we eube-ereatures
realized that there was one danger
from which we were not safe a dan-
ger that had crept gradually upon
us for eons as i told you when our
inner worlds had first formed here at
canopus heart they had moved in a
small ring at the very center of this
hollow space but though they would
have moved there always their
centrifugal force of motion just bal-
ancing the outward pull of canopus
around them there was another
foree acting upon them that was
the additional pull of all the thou-
sands of mighty suns that had
formed also around canopus whose
distant gravitational attraction act-
ing upon us through the encircling
fires was enough to cause our ring
of worlds to expand so that as time
went on the ring was moving just in-
side the encircling fires and very
soon we realized the unceasing pull
of the galaxys many suns would cause
our ring of worlds to spread into the
encircling fires our worlds plunging
to death inside those fires

  it was a mighty danger indeed
that confronted us and we gathered
all our power and craft to meet it
we eould not leave this space at

canopus center and migrate out-
ward in all our hordes yet death
faced our worlds swiftly here so
we made at last our great decision
to meet that danger by radiating
outward a great gravitation-destroy-
ing vibration that would nullify the
attraction of all the galaxys suns
that would halt their pull upon us
and save our worlds from death but
at the same time it would break up
the whole galaxy that however
was of but small import to us for
we were determined to save our own
worlds even though in doing so we
destroyed your universe



co we set to work upon the ap-
 paratus that was to radiate that
gravitation-destroying vibration out-
ward in each of our worlds was
placed a great square mechanism
whose top alone showed set flush in
each worlds surface and which
glowed with green foree as it radi-
ated those tremendous vibrations
eaeh green foree-square was pointed
out in a different direction by reason
of the ring-formation of our worlds
and so their vibrations would reach
through all the galaxy and upon
my own world was placed the
central control its super-intrieate
switches and recorders being located
in a small upheld cube-building just
beside the foree-square of that world

  our work was finished but only
just in time for while we had been
toiling upon it our ring of worlds
had been spread still farther and
they now were so close inside the en-
circling fires of canopus that minutes
more of that pull of the galaxys
suns would drag us into those fires
like mad beings we had worked
toward the last so that it was but
a few moments before our worlds
were to take their final plunge to

up from the somber canyon
of the picketwire the wind
rose and howled driving the
rain against the line-camp bunkhouse
f the diamond cross and the clus-
tering cedars and pinons bowed and
shuddered as if in horror of the
night

  inside the bunkhouse three men
were gathered shorty lawlor wiz-
ened and narrow-eyed shuffling cards
for his eternal solitaire rosy cheeks
dayton boyish and young and look-
ing out of place on a cattle-ranch
and pedro rivera the mexican-
bovine superstitious pedro with his
chin cupped in his hands staring
somberly at rosy

  rosy sat twirling a crucifix by its
chain between his slim fingers an
incredibly old crucifix it was all in-
crusted with dirt and grime of a
strange bizarre pattern that acc-ord-
w t-

ing to shorty looked heathenish
pedro says we oughta dig up the
body again and give it back the
cross observed shorty laying out
four aces

  dont see how it come to drop
off frowned rosy but as long as
it did im keeping it maybe thisll
bring real money from a museum or
some place say that fellow mustve
been lying there in his armor for
maybe three hundred years till the
flood washed him up he must be
one of the old spanish fellows that
used to ride herd around here
you been sayin that all day
said shorty wearily looks like a
hunk o nothin to me an i never
heard o no luck cornin from robbin
the dead

  we didnt rob him said rosy
indignantly   this dropped off when
we carried him over to the grave we

                                  


weird tales

dug what was the use of standing
out there in the rain to dig him up
again just to give him this liell
never miss it shut up pedro you
give me the galloping fidgets
why asked pedro in heavy
spanish why did not the dead one
rot and crumble in those three hun-
dred years

  airs too dry in colorado said
rosy shut up gosh listen to the
coyotes  

  wolves corrected shorty it
looks like even a wolfd have bet-
ter sense than to be out on a night
like this sufferin cactus what was
that  

  cutting high above the screaming
wind and lashing rain came a wild
inhuman cry the howling of the
wolves stopped abruptly
mountain-lion said rosy
aint no catsaid shorty not
out in the rain

 the scream came again nearer
this time and picking up his rifle
shorty stepped to the door the
rain lashed his face and the flick-
ering lamplight in the room only in-
tensified the darkness outside but its
feeble gleam must have carried for
a sudden shout came out of the dark-
ness shorty bellowed in reply

  and then into the circle of light a
man stepped as abruptly as if he had
materialized out of the night shorty
stepped back to allow him to enter
but at the threshold the man halted
looking up at the little cowpuncher
questioningly

    dont stand there stranger come
in come in

  with a smile that showed sharp-
pointed teeth the stranger entered
with a softly murmured a thou-
sand thanks my friend in oddly ac-
cented spanish

  rosy carelessly slipped the cruci-
fix about his neck as he arose to
greet the stranger he drew back a
step as the man came forward there
was something repulsive in the fel-
lows yellow parchment skin and

his black eyes that seemed to have a
red glow far back in their depths

  come here to the fire an squat
mister went on shorty hospitably
have an idee the rains cold

 most certainly agreed the
stranger still speaking spanish and
obeying shortys gesture a cascade
of water dropped from his broad-
brimmed stetson as he removed it
and rivulets ran from his sodden
goatskin chaps

  par ondc estd su caballof asked
rosy where is your horse ill put
it up with our string

  rosy understood him to say that
he had lost it as a matter of fact
the stranger was not easy to under-
stand the spanish he spoke was the
lisping castilian of old spain and
the words and construction he used
were equally stiange even pedro
for a moment had failed to recog-
nize his mother tongue on the other
hand the stranger seemed equally at
fault in understanding them though
both americans spoke mexican span-
ish nearly as well as english

 the wolves had taken up their
howling again and seemed to be cir-
cling nearer the bunldiouse

  camjo laughed the stranger
showing his pointed teeth again
harken to the little brethren

  the little brethren repeated
pedro puzzled

  of a certainty the wolves my
brother dost thou not hear them
also

  pedro like rosy drew back he
had no liking for a man who referred
to wolves as little brethren and
the easy use of the spanish second
person offended him a mexican re-
serves thou for his nearest and
dearest

  the stranger noted the backward
step and smiled again and pedro
wondered dully how his lips could
be so very red when his skin was so
yellow then the black eyes wan-
dered to rosy and fixed on the cruci-
fix
river of lost souls



   a curious object friend of mine
 methinks i have seen its like be-
 fore

   grasping the meaning rather than
 the words of the archaic speech
 rosy leaned forward that the stran-
 ger might examine it the better

   you would never guess where i
 found it he said in spanish with
 the very much rain the picketwire
 has flooded and we keep watch here
 to prevent the flood from drowning
 diamond cross cattle while we rode
 the canyon edge today we found a
 body in armor that the water had
 washed up when we reburied it
 this crucifix dropped from it the
 dead man no doubt was a spanish
 conquistador

   perhaps observed the stranger
 this poor fellow was one of those
 unfoitunate ones for whom the river
 was named-rio de las animas per-
 didas

   its the picketwire said shorty
 the practical

   but it used to be the las ani-
 mas argued rosy switching to
 english thats what the spanish
 called it originally-the river of
 damned souls then the french
 with the same idea called it le pur-
 - gatoire and thats where we get the
 name picketwire

   shorty shrugged his shoulders
 rosys high-school diploma had al-
 ways held him in awe

  i never could dope out that
 name went on rosy musingly
 most people say they called it that
 because the canyons such a gloomy
 place but sweet cats-it isnt that
 gloomy

   he broke off abruptly conscious
 of the demands of hospitality

   you must be very tired he con-
 tinued in spanish there is an ex-
 tra bunk-do us the honor to accept
 it

   the stranger arose and bowed

   with ten thousand thanks he
 said

   he reached out to place his hat on

a peg above the fireplace whence
pedro had taken a string of garlio
only an hour or two before with
the hat almost on the peg the mans
fingers twitched as with a sudden
spasm the sombrero dropped to the
floor he recovered it with a smile
and shrug placing it instead on the
mantel shelf

  pedro made a muttered exclama-
tion that sounded like  santissima
maria

  the stranger was the last between
blankets rosy watched him idly
from his own bunk and wondered
at his own distaste in removing the
crucifix about his throat another
thought came to him as he watched
the stranger the man was so out-
rageously awkward in undressing it
was almost as if he had never worn
a pair of chaps before and how
emaciated his body was then the
steady beat of the rain lulled rosy off
to sleep

he awoke with a start the rain
had stopped and the moon was
now shining intermittently between
scudding clouds fitfully illuminating
the cabins interior he awoke with
a vague feeling that something was
wrong

  he turned his head idly looking
over at pedros bunk and then his
breath came in with a hiss some-
thing was bending over the sleeping
man-something whose face was
pressed to pedros throat-some-
thing-

  stealthily rosy slipped his hand
from beneath the blankets and
groped for his gun it hung in its
holster at the head of his bunk his
fingers closed tightly around its
smooth black grip

  the thing turned as if scenting
the presence of danger it turned its
head toward rosy-and rosys first
shot went wild for the squared
open mouth dripped blood and a
trickle of blood lay dark against
pedros brown throat


weird tales

  and then even before rosy could
fire again the outlines of the thing
became hazy it seemed to shrink to
drop on all fours and a huge wolf
whose yellowed fangs dripped blood
crouched snarling across the cabin

  rosy heard a choking profane cry
from shorty and then the wolf had
leaped at his throat in a panic he
fired again-fired with his gun-muz-
zle touching the broad hairy breast
the great fangs clicked within an
inch of his throat-and the wolf fell
back

 he fired again-and heard the
crash of shortys thirty-thirty bul-
lets ripped the floor the walls all
about the wolf it crouched and
leaped again but again as if strik-
ing a stone wall it was hurled back
though its fetid breath was hot in
rosys face

 it snarled and leaped for the
barred door shorty fired again as it
passed-the bullet chucked into the
opposite wall and then the wolf was
gone the door remained closed and
barred

 it wasnt-it couldnt be-it
aint- shorty was babbling

  look said rosy faintly

  he pointed to the strangers bunk
the top blanket was thrown care-
lessly back but the lower blanket
lay smooth and unwrinkled there
was no sign that a body had ever lain
there the strangers clothes were
gone only his hat still lay on the
mantelpiece

 pedro yelled shorty he-
hes-

  but pedro was not dead with his
wide eyes sick with horror he lay
watching them

  with a shudder rosy picked up
the hat on the mantel-and dropped
it as if it had turned suddenly red-
hot from the inner band a series of
marks stared up at him-marks that
resolved themselves into a name-
john miller jack miller the owner
of the neighboring circle m-jack
miller who always dressed as if he

were to ride in a rodeo-with hair

chaps-

 god moaned shorty who-
what was it

  un vampiro said pedro in a
voice like a groan a vampire from
hell see avas it not that he could
not touch the peg where the garlic
hung is not garlic of the most ter-
rible to these things of the night
more than that said rosy
think how he talked-old-fash-
ioned and in jack millers clothes
and his face-wasnt it familiar it
was-it was the dead man from
picketwire canyon-from the river
of lost souls

  outside from down toward the
canyon the strange inhuman cry
shrilled and echoed again and the
howling wolves seemed to answer it
in a chorus of glee

padre rivas the priest of the little
mexican church at acequia negra
peered out of his window and smiled
in pleased fashion as he recognized
his visitors

  he liked rosy dayton until rosy
had come to the diamond cross
father rivas had often felt those
years spent in acquiring an educa-
tion were largely wasted if his life
was to be spent among people who
knew cicero only as the son of au-
gustus mutt and then too rosy
had never been known to refer to a
mexican as a spig

  but as he opened the door instant-
ly he knew something was wrong
rosys face was haggard and behind
him pedro rivera peered with star-
ing eyes and skin of pasty green

  rosy seated himself in the priests
parlor and twisted his hat nervously
between his fingers

  i-i have something to tell you
padre he began nervously it-
its altogether impossible but-well

it happened a-something-

  un demonio cried pedro a

very devil from hell-

  so it was padre the devil him-
river of lost souls



self and he plunged into a recital
of the nights events

  it was jack millers hat he
concluded i rode into sweetwater
this morning and told the deputy
sheriff they sent a posse around
and found the body the-the wolves
had been at it but-but padre
there was no evidence of blood in the
wounds he paused and shuddered
and then pedro and i rode out to
the canyon where we buried-the-
it the-the grave was empty
padre

  the priest sat silent for a moment
thoughtfully tapping the arm of his
chair

  to deny that there are literal
devils he said at last is to deny
the evidence of holy writ then
too it is evident that sacred and holy
things are abhorrent to this creature
save for that crucifix you too would

have died by-wolves and yet-

he paused and frowned and looked
at pedro

  pedros wits were preternaturally
sharp that morning he understood
even before rosy did his groping
fingers delved beneath his shirt and
brought a cross of gold to light

  why did it not save pedro fin-
ished the priest it can mean but
one thing-it means that only your
particular crucifix has any power
over the thing may i see it please

  rosy took it from his neck and
passed it to the priest rivas exam-
ined it closely and nodded

  it is of very ancient workman-
ship and of a curious pattern they
knew more of such creatures of the
night in those days than we do now
perhaps this has a significance that
escapes us yet it may be useful in
spite of that

  but padre what is to be done
babbled pedro

  little by our own power every-
thing by the power of the lord yet
it appears this is no ordinary vam-
pire who defies the power of cruci-
fixes and rests in ground not hal-

lowed you are surprized i know of
this i read many stories-he nod-
ded toward a pile of magazines on
the table-and those stories dealing
with the weird and supernatural i
dote on most perhaps now my hobby
shall be turned to account

  but what can we do padre no

bullet harms it-

  a stake through the heart said
the priest musingly but where
could we find the vampire at rest  a
branch of wild rose a sacred bullet
-the same objection frankly my
son i do not know but let me coun-
sel you thus do not tell this story to
others your countrymen would
laugh at you mine would be panic-
stricken silence i impose on you-
both of you

 but if theyre not warned-

  i will take steps and remember
this always even as st john has
written even the devils are subject
to us through thy name 

angela velez angela of the tum-
bled hair and flashing eyes and
slim brown legs-angela was doing
the family washing in the little rivu-
let that trickles down from the
acequia negra humming a verse of
el coyotito as she worked

  a song very beautiful--that ob-
served a voice in spanish from across
the streamlet

  angela started and looked up a
tall bareheaded man stood looking
down at her with a smile-a man
clad in goatskin chaps and a very
torn and dirty shirt with curious
dark stains down the front of it in
the shadow of the cedars his eyes
glowed queerly and his voice had an
odd accent that she understood with
difficulty

 i am happy that you like my
song she said

  only beautiful songs could pass
such lips said the stranger gal-
lantly is it permitted that i talk
with thee of the near at hand


weird tales

  angela looked at him carefully
and found mm not ill-looking except
for his sallow skin slightly wrinkled
courtly strangers are rare along the
picketwire so

  the brook is but a narrow one
senor

  indeed a man could hare crossed
it in a stride with ease but the
stranger after half a step forward
turned and proceeded upstream to
the spring around which he walked
and back down on her side of the
water

  i he observed am don diego
cosme rosales y mendoza and what
might be the name of such a lovely
daughter of old spain

  lama daughter of mexico   said
angela primly and my name is
angela velez

  mexico said don diego and his
eyes widened then he smiled as he
added angela indeed thou art a
very angel my dear

  he paused and straightened in a
listening attitude the tread of
horses was audible from the cedars
beyond the aeequia angela arose
and stood beside him watching

  a dusty weary horse plodded into
sight with rosy dayton astride it
angela smiled

  even as father rivas she liked
rosy-originally because he was the
only american at sweetwater who
called her angela rather than ann-
jelly and more recently with all
the fire of her loyal coquettish little
mexican heart

  but now rosys face was strained
and haggard as he rode up and dis-
mounted beside her

  greetings mi angelita he mur-
mured with the travesty of his usual
grin have you seen any strangers
about

  angela stared at him in surprize
and turned to where don diego had
stood a moment before

  a horned toad stared glassily from
the shade of a prickly pear but of
don diego there was no sign

 why where is he she ex-
claimed only a moment since-a
most gallant gentleman roseo mio
don diego cosme rosales y men-
doza    she rolled the lordly syllables
on her tongue with delight only a
moment ago he stood there

  what did he look like asked
rosy hoarsely

  oh muy distinguido of the most
notable but he wore no hat roseo
and his skin was yellowed but his
lips were oh so very red

  his face wasnt wrinkled

  but no roseo of the scarcely at
all

  he would be muttered rosy
he would be younger

  you know him oh roseo

  rosy looked down at her miser-
ably no use in spreading panic
father rivas had said the priest
had a plan of his own but angela
-her smooth brown throat with the
soft little hollow at its base-and
don diego out there in the tangle of
cedars without answering he
snatched the crucifix from his own
throat and gave it to her

  wear that always angelita

and- he paused and looked at

the unfinished washing come ill
help you finish the clothes this
aeequia is no place for you t 

  but roseo-all my life i have
lived in aeequia negra

  but not at the spring said
rosy   and its-its different now  
but when the washing was fin-
ished and carried to the adobe house
beyond the cedars he did not linger
to angelas disappointment he
mounted and rode hastily away

  don diego must be found before
another night-and what might that
night bring he had looked fever-
ishly through the magazines father
rivas had shown him-through the
book of dracida after all vantpires
werent invincible and if the span-
iard had been in the vicinity so re-
cently he could scarcely have trav-
eled far--or could he the dead
river of lost souls



travel fast- rosy groaned as

he urged his tired horse past the
spring and up into the mesas beyond
then vvith a sudden new idea he
circled back toward acequia negra
but angela was piqued at his
abrupt leaving he had not so much
as kissed her certainly don diego
would have been more gallant and
why had he disappeared so quickly
when rosy had ridden up perhaps
he was still about the spring she
would go and see the acequia no
place for her nonsense rosy must
be jealous gurgling happily at the
thought she slipped back toward the
spring

  and scarcely had she reached it
when don diego stood before her as
suddenly as if he had risen from the
earth the horned toad was gone
but beside him crouched the tame
coyote of manuel garcia the ani-
mal seemed to combine a curious
mixture of elation and terror

 why did you run away de-
manded angela is it that you
fear senor roseo

  don diegos red lips smiled though
his eyes did not

  i fear no man but who am i to
intrude between a senorita and her
lover behold he has brought thee a
love token

  one lean forefinger pointed at the
crucifix about angelas throat she
gurgled happily again

  he told me to wear it always is
it not of the most beautiful
indeed it is come here-by the
spring-in the better light that i
may see it

  wonderingly angela followed him
the cedar-shaded spring could scarce-
ly be said to afford better light don
diegos hand moved toward the
cross then stopped abruptly

  wilt thou not hold it in thy so
small hands that i may see it more
closely

  angela hesitated a moment rosy
fcad told her to wear it always but

always hardly meant she might never
remove it not even for a moment
she slipped the chain over her head
and extended it in her cupped hands
to don diego

  but the spaniard made no attempt
to touch it he took a side-step that
brought him to the bank of the
spring the coyote following close at
his heels angela wondered at that
too heretofore only manuel could
control the little wolf

  and then she saw something else
that sent a little icy trickle down her
spine the inky surface of the black
spring cast back her reflection from
her tousled hair to her slim ankles-
but of don diego beside her it gave
no sign she looked again no there
was no image of don diego

  she looked at him with horror-
widening eyes-and the dons lips
ceased smiling he barked some
harsh word and the coyote leaped
straight against her outstretched
arm it sprang and fell into the water
beyond and with it went the cruci-
fix the weight of its heavy gold
carrying it like a plummet into the
bottomless black water

    y ou-you wizard   screamed
angela you have lost me the gift
of roseo

  with scratching fingers she sprang
at the spaniards face but he
caught her wrists in a grip like steel
the strength of twenty men must
have been in his thin hands icy-cold

  yes my little angel he mocked
i have lost thee thy charm that
would have bound me to the grave
for another three centuries no no
struggle not little one the strength
of many men have i and power such
as no man knows supreme am i
little flower supreme and of the most
powerful never again can another
crucifix like that one be made fra
domenico made it may his soul
shrivel who knew the lore of the
ancient church and the magic of the
aztecs and the indians killed fra
domenico three hundred years ago


weird tales

never again may the might of man

or of- a name trembled on

his lips that he seemed unable to ut-
ter no might in the universe may
prevail against me he finished

  he released her wrists and beat
himself upon the chest and laughed
-a wild shrill laugh that the coy-
lote answered with a staccato bark

  for this purpose the son of god
was manifested-that he might de-
stroy the works of the devil the
voice strong and calm came from
behind them

  at the first words don diego had
whirled and started as if burned
with a white-hot iron

  father rivas stood behind them
quietly fingering his rosary with
rosy beside him

  the don recovered himself

  once he observed thy words
would have frightened me priest
but no more centuries ago before
the genoese discovered this land of
thine i found the secret of immor-
tality once it is true i was caught
at my rest and bound to the earth
for a time yet even fra domenico
succeeded only partly at stated
times my spirit stepped free from
the body chained by his accursed
arts and roamed the world again
much that i saw i did not under-
stand much that i heard was in a
language i do not know but this i
learned there is  power today to
equal mine-nothing may ever de-
stroy me   he paused a moment and
seemed to shiver nothing he re-
peated with increased vehemence

 except the god you have for-
sworn

  don diego laughed

  only by arts that thou or no liv-
ing man knowest priest i am su-
preme soon thy pale bodies shall be
my founts of life thy women-he
paused to eye angela-thy women
shall be mine in this life and in life
after the death which is not death
a new kingdom i shall found-

  rosys hand had disappeared in
his pocket it came forth now hold-
ing an open clasp-knife the count
of dracula in the story had been
slain with a knife    the spaniard
watched him with a tolerant smile
continued smiling even when the
broad blade was buried to the hilt in
his breast

 rosy sprang back panting he
raised the knife to strike again the
dons ice-cold fingers touched him-
the strength seemed to drain from
his arms

  it is useless said the spaniard
the cleft heart-the severed head-
the driven stake-are for others but
not for me

 what know you of magic
asked the priest scornfully what
know you of the magic that can
transport mans voice across thou-
sands of miles of space of the magic
that enables man to fly swifter than
the fleetest bird that enables him to
stay under water for hours that can
in moments slay whole cities or cause
the heart that has stopped to beat
once more

  don diego stared at him intently
and once more seemed to shiver
slightly

  it may be as thou sayest he
nodded at last indeed some of it
i know is true but tell me oh priest
can thy wizards of this day do this
as he spoke he glanced up at the
sky the sun was almost-not quite
-at the zenith his hands made a
few passes in the air and the out-
lines of his body grew misty in a
moment only a wisp of vapor could
be seen floating down toward the
river of lost souls and an eery
laugh seemed to drift back toward
them the coyote raised its muzzle
and howled quaveringly

  yet he is not invincible said
the priest slowly even as he
boasted the memory of something
with power to destroy him came to
him for the devils also believe and
tremble 
river of lost souls



 tts another said rosy hollowly
a as he dropped heavily into a
chair angela leaned over timidly
and stroked his shoulder a-a
baby at bear springs every bit of

blood-gone- 

  dead asked father rivas and
then more slowly undead

  they were at the velez dobe he
and rosy where don diego was seen
most often-now a bat that fluttered
at the windows now a wolf that
howled in the cedars now a rattle-
snake that basked in the sun scorn-
ful of rocks hurled at it-or of bul-
lets

  i cant go through it again
moaned rosy when we-we-
staked-the little boy at poso-and
the sheep-herder at lockwood-and

-and jack-

 we gave them peace my son
said the priest softly it is the work
of god

  three weeks had passed with don
diego still at large the americans
at sweetwater knew him only as the
murderer of jack miller and pos-
sibly others what the mexicans
knew they did not say but strings
of garlic hung at door and windows
of every dobe and every brown
throat was encircled by necklaces of
cloves of garlic

  yet the deaths of three people and
the mysterious illness of others
whose blood seemed to drain through
tiny wounds in their throats had
given them precious clues to the
vampires strength and weakness in
spite of his boasts he was bound by
some of the laws of the undead he
cast no shadow or reflection he
could not enter a house without
being invited he could not cross
running water the presence of gar-
lic banished him and apparently he
must remain in one form whatever
it might be between the hours of
noon and sunset

 if only groaned rosy we
could do something but we cant

find a trace of him when he-rests-

and-

  there was a commotion at the
door pedro wild-eyed stumbled in
voluble for once from fright

  i have seen him cried the man
wildly i have seen him and only
the good god has saved me out
there in the mesas-beyond the
spring-he was coming through the
trees-his red eyes burned into me
carramba-my feet they were frozen
-i could not move he was licking
those lips with that little red tongue
like a serpents i clutched the garlic
about my throat and trembled and
then as he stepped between two
trees entangled he was in a twisting
vine he jerked he tugged he
swore and as he was on the point of
freeing himself i became alive again
and fled from the place

  the last of it rosy had scarcely
heard as an enormous idea took
shape in his mind no lethal weapon
might harm the spaniard but a vine
might ensnare him and hold him

fast then perhaps-

  he arose with a sudden bitter
little laugh

  father rivas said the arm of
god is strong and shall prevail i
think don diego shall change his
mind about the power of god
then his voice altered as he spoke
gently in spanish

   angelita mia i ask of you a ter-
rible thing i ask you to risk your
life-and the life after death-and
the soul-to bring diego back to the
earth from whence he came canst
thou do it mi querida

  angela brushed back her tousled
hair as she looked up at him with
wondering eyes he winced as he
saw how pale and thin she had be-
come in these last days

  i roseo what is it that i can
do but oh yes querido mio my
fault it was for losing the crucifix
she choked a little my life i would
give so gladly to undo that

  my fault it was said rosy


weird tales

gloomily for not replacing the
thing on his cursed body but please
god it ivill be undone you must go
to the canyon cmgelita and walk
there daily until he finds you i will
be hidden close by and i think-
there is just a chance-that he will
never harm people more but the
garlic you must not wear for then
lie might not come

  angela shivered as she stared out
toward the somber black spring
then with a swift motion she tore the
cloves of garlic from her throat

  promise me roseo she almost
whispered that if-that if-don
diego succeeds-you will not let me
-be as he is promise roseo mio
rosy closed his eyes suppose his
wild guess was wrong-in fancy he
could see the red lips grin in triumph
-the squared mouth again dripping
with blood-angelas blood the
thought of a stake plunging through
her soft little body-rosy choked and
then another vision-the body of jack
miller-his friend-of the boy at
poso-of the sheep-herder-of the
baby at bear springs-of all the
other bodies that would follow   

  i promise angelita-oh carissima
mia and he held her tightly as if
to defy the power of don diego to
snatch her from him

  dimly he was aware that the arms
of father rivas were around them
both

angela stood tense by the edge of
the canyon the sun was sinking
-in a few minutes all the forces of
evil would be don diegos if rosy
failed-she shivered as she moved
nearer the canyons rim

  close beside her a tortuous trail
led down to the river but just at her
feet the canyon wall dropped sheer
in a dizzy precipice if rosy failed-
down there would be peace-and rest
that the vampire might not break

  father rivas was back there too
she knew a crucifix clutched in his
hand and prayers mounting desper-

ately to his lips he had said the
great god would protect her-but
would he she turned her face up
to the magnificence of the sunset sky
would he who moved sun and stars
pause to pity her-the little mexican
girl-the spig she looked back
toward sweetwater-where the wise
americanos laughed at spig supersti-
tions-the wise americanos for whom
she was offering to die   

  evening greetingslittle flower
the dons deep voice boomed in her
ear she looked up into a face that
had grown twenty years younger in
a month i feared it was that thou
liked me not yet here i see thee to
meet me a blessed day little one

  father rivas back among the
trees had thrilled he alone had
seen don diego plod up the steep
trail from the canyons bottom
their surmise was right superior
though he was to stake or knife or
crucifix yet one law of the undead
still bound him caught at noon in
the form of man a man he must re-
main until sunset for he would
scarcely climb that weary trail if he
might fly as a bat or float up as a
wisp of vapor

  but where was rosy angela was
shrinking back from the vampires
embrace she seemed like a bird the
priest had once seen charmed by a
rattler where was the thud of
horses hoofs only the barking of
a prairie-dog broke the silence

  the priest darted forward the
crucifix held out before him he
snatched angela almost from the
spaniards arms-stood at bay be-
tween them the spaniard smiled
faintly

  a good evening to thee priest
what is that toy thou hast there   

  back to your grave cried the
priest unclean ye are of your
father the devil back i say

  once before i told thee thy-
the vampire faltered-thy master
is powerless proof i shall give thee
when yonder sun sets in-
river of lost souls



  there was a clatter of hoofs on the
stones something long and black
and snaky whirled and hissed
through the air the noose of a raw-
hide riata settled about don diegos
shoulders

  all in a second rosys trained
pony whirled off at right angles
even the enormous strength of the
vampire could not withstand the
rush and plunge of the galloping
horse he was hurled off his feet
battered against the rocks as his
body bounced and dashed at the end
of the riata rosy spurred down the
canyon trail

  angelas scream was drowned in
the torrent of oaths that poured
from the struggling spaniards lips
his hands caught the riata hauled
on it with terrible strength but the
strength of fifty men could not have
snapped that plaited rawhide

 from rock to rock he bounced
down to the river of lost souls it
seemed his bones must be shattered
yet somehow he struggled to his feet
as they reached the canyons bottom

  the flood waters had passed away
the river was now in its normal
state two trickling rivulets in a
waste of gravel and sand almost
overnight weeds and grass had
sprung up in the river bed-except
in one patch of raw red sand-bar-
ren and sinister

  down the river-bed rosy galloped
his horse laboring against the vam-
pires strength that equaled a score
of men not for a moment must don
diego be allowed to gain firm foot-
ing

  now they were opposite that bar-
ren spot of sand- rosy touched one
spur to his horse it whirled in its
tracks like the lash of a cracking
whip don diego was flung about
out from the clean grass he was
hurled onto the blood-red sand

  rosy touched the reins and the
horse plowed to a stop with his
face stony-hard as the rocks of the
canyon he opened a clasp-knife the

riata hummed like a violin-string as
it parted don diego floundered to
his knees

  from the canyons brim angela
and father rivas saw him arise but
now he was in to his ankles and
even as they watched him plunge and
flounder he sank to his knees

  in that instant some hint of his
fate seemed to dawn on the spaniard
he screamed terribly as he clawed
desperately at the slack rawhide he
exerted all his enormous strength-
and sank to his waist

  his hands moved in the air mak-
ing frenzied passes his reddening
eyes rolled up to the sun that
hovered over the canyons rim

 then he screamed again-the
scream of a lost soul that looks into
hell

  save me he screamed save
me i will not harm thee i prom-
ise-the word of a peer of spain i
will depart from here-i will return
to castille-

  the trio of watchers remained
silent

 i will make you rich he
screamed as the red sand reached to
his breast i know the hiding-place
of the canyons gold yellow gold-
bullion-twelve great chests full
all for you-if you but save me  

  and when they still made no an-
swer he cursed them wildly

  may your souls shrivel as will
my body locked in this accursed
sand-for all time to come-the
thirst-the torture-

  he clutched at his throat he
clawed at the sand suddenly he
seemed very small and pitiful they
wondered why they had feared him
angela moved as if she would de-
scend to help him father rivas
granite-jawed stopped her

  then a gleam of triumph came into
the red eyes the sun sank behind
the canyons rim his arms waved
again making passes in the air

  as once before the outlines of his
head and waving arms grew misty


weird tales

all else lay beneath the sand and
then a wisp of vapor hovered in the
air where he had been

oh god prayed the priest his
knuckles white as he clutched the

cross oh god do not permit-

he broke off then raised his voice in
a great shout i thank thee oh my
god-i thank thee-

far below the wisp of vapor was
disappearing in the sand being
sucked inexorably down attached

unbreakably to that which lay be-
neath it twisted and struggled in
the failing light and then it was
gone

  the red sand lay desolate and bar-
ren as before as rosy rode back up
the canyon angela was running to
meet him

  and a vagrant wind chuckled as if
in glee among the cedars for the
river of lost souls had reclaimed its
own never to loose it more

marmora

 by donald wandrei

  out of the west foul breezes sweep

  out of the dark where the black moons creep
  with the breath of the web-faced things asleep
  in marmora

  a ruby flares in the glistening sky

  in the marble palace gold dwarfs cry
  long-dead creatures murmur and sigh
  in marmora

  in a marsh that even the water-snakes spurn
  mandrakes writhe and witch-fires bum

 swart talons toward the ruby turn

 in marmora

  all night the blood-red ruby glares

  before the palace a beacon flares

  but the spell-bound half-beasts lie in their lairs
                in marmora

  out of the sky a black star shines

  from the palace a marble monster whines

 on the throne a king for its worm-queen pines
               in marmora

  smooth is the liquid ink of the lake

  on its shore mad emeralds burn in the brake

  a slain man moans on a pointed stake

  story

by clatm-ashton-sm

ful vampire accursed lamia she-
seipent of hell thundered the abbot

the following narrative was
found among the papers of
christophe morand a young
law-student of tours after his unac-
countable disappearance during a
visit at his fathers home near mou-
lins in november 

  a sinister brownish-purple autumn
twilight made premature by the im-
minence of a sudden thunderstorm
had filled the forest of averoigne
the trees along my road were al-
ready blurred to ebon masses and
the road itself pale and spectral be-
fore me in the thickening gloom
seemed to waver and quiver slightly
as with the tremor of some mysteri-
ous earthquake i spurred my horse

who was wofully tired with a jour-
ney begun at dawn and had fallen
hours ago to a protesting and reluc-
tant trot and we galloped adown the
darkening road between enormous
oaks that seemed to lean toward us
with boughs like clutching fingers as
we passed

  with dreadful rapidity the night
was upon us the blackness became a
tangible clinging veil a nightmare
confusion and desperation drove me
to spur my mount again with a more
cruel rigor and now as we went the
first far-off mutter of the storm min-
gled with the clatter of my horses
hoofs and the first lightning flashes
illumed our way which to my


weird tales

amazement since i believed myself
on the main highway through aver-
oigne had inexplicably narrowed to
a well-trodden footpath feeling
sure that i had gone astray but not
caring to retrace my steps in the
teeth of darkness and the towering
clouds of the tempest i hurried on
hoping as seemed reasonable that a
path so plainly worn would lead
eventually to some house or chateau
where i could find refuge for the
night my hope was well-founded
for within a few minutes i descried a
glimmering light through the forest-
boughs and came suddenly to an
open glade where on a gentle emi-
nence a large building loomed with
several litten windows in the lower
story and a top that was well-nigh
indistinguishable against the bulks
of driven cloud

 doubtless a monastery  i
thought as i drew rein and descend-
ing from my exhausted mount lifted
the heavy brazen knocker in the form
of a dogs head and let it fall on the
oaken door the sound was unex-
pectedly loud and sonorous with a
reverberation almost sepulchral and
i shivered involuntarily with a sense
of startlement of unwonted dismay
this a moment later was wholly dis-
sipated when the door was thrown
open and a tall ruddy-featured monk
stood before me in the cheerful glow
of the cressets that illumed a capa-
cious hallway

  i bid you welcome to the abbey
of perigon he said in a suave rum-
ble and even as he spoke another
robed and hooded figure appeared
and took my horse in charge as i
murmured my thanks and acknowl-
edgments the storm broke and tre-
mendous gusts of rain accompanied
by ever-nearing peals of thunder
drove with demoniac fury on the
door that had closed behind me

  it is fortunate that you found us
when you did observed my host
 twere ill for man and beast to be
abroad in such a hell-brew 

  divining without question that i

was hungry as well as tired he led
me to the refectory and set before
me a bountiful meal of mutton
brown bread lentils and a strong
excellent red wine

  he sat opposite me at the refec-
tory table while i ate and with my
hunger a little mollified i took occa-
sion to scan him more attentively he
was both tall and stoutly built and
his features where the brow was no
less broad than the powerful jaw be-
tokened intellect as well as a love
for good living a certain delicacy
and refinement an air of scholarship
of good taste and good breeding
emanated from him and i thought
to myself   this monk is probably a
connoisseur of books as well as of
wines doubtless my expression be-
trayed the quickening of my curi-
osity for he said as if in answer

  i am hilaire the abbot of peri-
gon we are a benedictine order
who live in amity with god and with
all men and we do not hold that the
spirit is to be enriched by the morti-
fication or impoverishment of the
body we have in our butteries an
abundance of wholesome fare in our
cellars the best and oldest vintages
of the district of averoigne and if
such things interest you as mayhap
they do we have a library that is
stocked with rare tomes with pre-
cious manuscripts with the finest
works of heathendom and christen-
dom even to certain unique writings
that survived the holocaust of alex-
andria

  i appreciate your hospitality i
said bowing i am christophe mo-
rand a law-student on my way
home from tours to my fathers
estate near moulins i too am a
lover of books and nothing would
delight me more than the privilege
of inspecting a library so rich and
curious as the one whereof you
speak

  forthwith while i finished my
meal we fell to discussing the clas-
sics and to quoting and capping pas-
sages from latin greek or christian
the end of the story



authors my host i soon discovered
was a scholar of uncommon attain-
ments with an erudition a ready
familiarity with both ancient and
modern literature that made my own
seem as that of the merest beginner
by comparison he on his part was
so good as to commend my far from
perfect latin and by the time i had
emptied my bottle of red wine we
were chatting familiarly like old
friends

  all my fatigue had now flown to
be succeeded by a rare sense of well-
being of physical comfort combined
with mental alertness and keenness
so when the abbot suggested that
we pay a visit to the library i as-
sented with alacrity

he led me down a long corridor
 each side of which were cells
belonging to the brothers of the or-
der and unlocked with a large
brazen key that depended from his
girdle the door of a great room with
lofty ceiling and several deep-set
windows truly he had not ex-
aggerated the resources of the li-
brary  for the long shelves were
overcrowded with books and many
volumes were piled high on the tables
or stacked in corners there were
rolls of papyrus of parchment of
vellum there were strange byzan-
tine or coptic bibles there were old
arabic and persian manuscripts with
floriated or jewel-studded covers
there were scores of incunabula from
the first printing-presses there were
innumerable monkish copies of an-
tique authors bound in wood or
ivory with rich illuminations and
lettering that was often in itself a
work of art

  with a care that was both loving
and meticulous the abbot hilaire
brought out volume after volume for
my inspection many of them i had
never seen before some were un-
known to me even by fame or rumor
my excited interest my unfeigned
enthusiasm evidently pleased him

for at length he pressed a hidden
spring in one of the library tables
and drew out a long drawer in
which he told me were certain treas-
ures that he did not care to bring
forth for the edification or delecta-
tion of many and whose very exist-
ence was undreamed of by the monks

  here he continued are three
odes by catullus which you will not
find in any published edition of his
works here also is an original
manuscript of sappho-a complete
copy of a poem otherwise extant
only in brief fragments here are
two of the lost tales of miletus a
letter of pericles to aspasia an un-
known dialogue of plato and an old
arabian work on astronomy by some
anonymous author in which the the-
ories of copernicus are anticipated
and lastly here is the somewhat
infamous histoire damour by ber-
nard de vaillanteoeur which was de-
stroyed immediately upon publica-
tion and of which only one other copy
is known to exist

  as i gazed with mingled awe and
curiosity on the unique unheard-of
treasures he displayed i saw in one
corner of the drawer what appeared
to be a thin volume with plain un-
titled binding of dark leather i ven-
tured to pick it up and found that
it contained a few sheets of closely
written manuscript in old french

  and this i queried turning to
look at hilaire whose face to my
amazement had suddenly assumed a
melancholy and troubled expression

  it were better not to ask my
son he crossed himself as he spoke
and his voice was no longer mellow
but harsh agitated full of a sorrow-
ful perturbation there is a curse
on the pages that you hold in your
hand an evil spell a malign power
is attached to them and he who
would venture to peruse them is
henceforward in dire peril both of
body and soul he took the little
volume from me as he spoke and re-


weikd tales

turned it to the drawer again cross-
ing himself carefully as he did so

  but father i dared to expostu-
late how can such things be how
can there be danger in a few written
sheets of parchment

  chvistophe there are things be-
yond your understanding things
that it were not well for you to
know the might of satan is mani-
festable in devious modes in diverse
manners there are other tempta-
tions than those of the world and the
flesh there are evils no less subtle
than irresistible there are hidden
heresies and necromancies other
than those which sorcerers practise

  with what then are these pages
concerned that such occult peril
such unholy power lurks within
them

  i forbid you to ask his tone
was one of great rigor with a finali-
ty that dissuaded me from further
questioning

  for you my son he went on
the danger would be doubly great
because you are young ardent full
of desires and curiosities believe me
it is better to forget that you have
even seen this manuscript he
closed the hidden drawer and as he
did so the melancholy troubled look
was replaced by his former benign-
ity

  now he said as he turned to
one of the book-shelves i will show
you the copy of ovid that was owned
by the poet petrarch he was
again the mellow scholar the kindly
jovial host and it was evident that
the mysterious manuscript was not
to be referred to again but his odd
perturbation the dark and awful
hints he had let fall the vague ter-
rific terms of his proscription had all
served to awaken my wildest curios-
ity and though i felt the obsession
to be unreasonable i was quite un-
able to think of anything else for the
rest of the evening all manner of
speculations fantastie absurd out-
rageous ludicrous terrible defiled

through my brain as i duly admired
the incunabula which hilaire took
down so tenderly from the shelves
for my delectation

 at last toward midnight he led
me to my room-a room especially
reserved for visitors and with more
of comfort of actual luxury in its
hangings carpets and deeply quilted
bed than was allowable in the cells
of the monks or of the abbot himself
even when hilaire had withdrawn
and i had proved for my satisfaction
the softness of the bed allotted me
my brain still whirled with questions
concerning the forbidden manu-
script though the storm had now
ceased it was long before i fell
asleep but slumber when it finally
came was dreamless and profound

when i awoke a river of sun-
shine clear as molten gold was
pouring through my window the
storm had wholly vanished and no
lightest tatter of cloud was visible
anywhere in the pale-blue october
heavens i ran to the window and
peered out on a world of autumnal
forest and fields all a-sparkle with
the diamonds of rain all was beauti-
ful all was idyllic to a degree that
could be fully appreciated only by
one who had lived for a long time
as i had within the walls of a city
with towered buildings in lieu of
trees and cobbled pavements where
grass should be but charming as it
was the foreground held my gaze
only for a few moments then be-
yond the tops of the trees i saw a
hill not more than a mile distant on
whose summit there stood the rains
of some old chateau the crumbling
broken-down condition of whose
walls and towers was plainly visible
it drew my gaze irresistibly with an
overpowering sense of romantic at-
traction which somehow seemed so
natural so inevitable that i did not
pause to analyze or wonder and
once having seen it i could not take
my eyes away but lingered at the
the end op the story



window for how long i knew not
scrutinizing as closely as i could the
details of each time-shaken turret
and bastion some undefinable fasci-
nation was inherent in the very form
the extent the disposition of the
pile-some fascination not dissimilar
to that exerted by a srain of music
by a magical combination of words
in poetry by the features of a be-
loved face gazing i lost myself in
reveries that i could not recall after-
ward but which left behind them the
same tantalizing sense of innominable
delight which forgotten nocturnal
dreams may sometimes leave

  i was recalled to the actualities of
life by a gentle knock at my door
and realized that i had forgotten to
dress myself it was the abbot who
came to inquire how i had passed the
night and to tell me that breakfast
was ready whenever i should care to
arise for some reason i felt a little
embarrassed even shamefaced to
have been caught day-dreaming
and though this was doubtless un-
necessary i apologized for my dila-
toriness hilaire i thought gave me
a keen inquiring look which was
quickly withdrawn as with the
suave courtesy of a good host he as-
sured me that there was nothing
whatever for which i need apologize

  when i had breakfasted i told
hilaire with many expressions of
gratitude for his hospitality that it
was time for me to resume my jour-
ney but his regret at the announce-
ment of my departure was so un-
feigned his invitation to tarry for
at least another night was so genu-
inely hearty so sincerely urgent
that i consented to remain in
truth i required no great amount of
solicitation for apart from the real
liking i had taken to hilaire the
mystery of the forbidden manuscript
had entirely enslaved my imagina-
tion and i was loth to leave without
having learned more concerning it
also for a youth with scholastic
leanings the freedom of the abbots

library was a rare privilege a pre-
cious opportunity not to be passed
over

  i should like i said to pursue
certain studies while i am here with
the aid of your incomparable collec-
tion

  my son you are more than wel-
come to remain for any length of
time and you can have access to my
books whenever it suits your need or
inclination so saying hilaire de-
tached the key of the library from
his girdle and gave it to me there
are duties he went on which
will call me away from the monas-
tery for a few hours today and
doubtless you will desire to study in
my absence

  a little later he excused himself
and departed with inward felicita-
tions on the longed-for opportunity
that had fallen so readily into my
hands i hastened to the library with
no thought save to read the pro-
scribed manuscript giving scarcely
a glance at the laden shelves i
sought the table with the secret
drawer and fumbled for the spring
after a little anxious delay i pressed
the proper spot and drew forth the
drawer an impulsion that had be-
come a veritable obsession a fever of
curiosity that bordered upon actual
madness drove me and if the safety
of my soul had really depended
upon it i could not have denied the
desire which forced me to take from
the drawer the thin volume with
plain unlettered binding

seating myself in a chair near one
of the windows i began to peruse
the pages which were only six in
number the writing was peculiar
with letter-forms of a fantasticality
i had never met before and the
french was not only old but well-
nigh barbarous in its quaint singu-
larity notwithstanding the diffi-
culty i found in deciphering them a
mad unnaccountable thrill ran
through me at the first words and i


weird tales

read on with all the sensations of a
man who has been bewitched or who
has drunken a philtre of bewildering
potency

  there was no title no date and
the writing was a narrative which
began almost as abruptly as it ended
it concerned one gerard comte de
venteillon who on the eve of his
marriage to the renowned and beau-
tiful demoiselle eleanor des lys
had met in the forest near his cha-
teau a strange half-human creature
with hoofs and horns now gerard
as the narrative explained was a
knightly youth of indisputably
proven valor as well as a true chris-
tian so in the name of our savior
jesus christ he bade the creature
stand and give an account of itself

  laughing wildly in the twilight
the bizarre being capered before him
and cried

  i am a satyr and your christ is
less to me than the weeds that grow
on your kitchen-middens  

  appalled by such blasphemy ge-
rard would have drawn his sword to
slay the creature but again it cried
saying

  stay gerard de venteillon and
i will tell you a secret knowing
which you will forget the worship
of christ and forget your beautiful
bride of tomorrow and turn your
back on the world and on the very
sun itself with no reluctance and no
regret

  now albeit half unwillingly ge-
rard lent the satyr an ear and it came
closer and whispered to him and
that which it whispered is not
known but before it vanished amid
the blackening shadows of the for-
est the satyr spoke aloud once more
and said

  the power of christ has pre-
vailed like a black frost on all the
woods the fields the rivers the
mountains where abode in their fe-
licity the glad immortal goddesses
and nymphs of yore but still in the
cryptic caverns of earth in places

far underground like the hell your
priests have fabled there dwells the
pagan loveliness there cry the pagan
ecstasies and with the last words
the creature laughed again its wild
unhuman laugh and disappeared
among the darkening boles of the
twilight trees

  from that moment a change was
upon gerard de venteillon he re-
turned to his chateau with downcast
mien speaking no cheery or kindly
word to his retainers as was his
wont but sitting or pacing always in
silence and scarcely heeding the
food that was set before him nor
did he go that evening to visit his
betrothed as he had promised but
toward midnight when a waning
moon had arisen red as from a bath
of blood he went forth clandestinely
by the postern door of the chateau
and following an old half-obliter-
ated trail through the woods found
his way to the ruins of the chateau
des faussesflammes which stands on
a hill opposite the benedictine abbey
of perigon

  now these ruins said the manu-
script are very old and have long
been avoided by the people of the
district for a legendry of immemo-
rial evil clings about them and itis
said that they are the dwelling-place
of foul spirits the rendezvous of
sorcerers and succubi but gerard
as if oblivious or fearless of their ill
renown plunged like one who is
devil-driven into the shadow of the
crumbling walls and went with the
careful groping of a man who fol-
lows some given direction to the
northern end of the courtyard there
directly between and below the two
centermost windows which it may
be looked forth from the chamber of
forgotten chatelaines he pressed
with his right foot on a flagstone dif-
fering from those about it in being
of a triangular form and the flag-
stone moved and tilted beneath his
foot revealing a flight of granite
steps that went down into the earth
the end of the story



then lighting a taper he had brought
with him gerard descended the
steps and the flagstone swung into
place behind him

  on the morrow his betrothed
eleanor des lys and all her bridal
train waited vainly for him at the
cathedral of vyones the principal
town of averoigne where the wed-
ding had been set and from that
time his face was beheld by no man
and-no vaguest rumor of gerard de
venteillon or of the fate that befell
him has ever passed among the liv-
ing   

  such was the substance of the for-
bidden manuscript and thus it end-
ed as i have said before there was
no date nor was there anything to
indicate by whom it had been writ-
ten or how the knowledge of the
happenings related had come into the
writers possession but oddly enough
it did not occur to me to doubt their
veridity for a moment and the cu-
riosity i had felt concerning the
contents of the manuscript was now
replaced by a burning desire a thou-
sandfold more powerful more obses-
sive to know the ending of the story
and to learn what gerard de venteil-
lon had found when he descended the
hidden steps

   in reading the tale it had of course
occurred to me that the ruins of the
chateau des faussesflammes de-
scribed therein were the very same
ruins i had seen that morning from
my chamber window and pondering
this i became more and more pos-
sessed by an insane fever by a frenet-
ic unholy excitement returning the
manuscript to the secret drawer i
left the library and wandered for
awhile in an aimless fashion about the
corridors of the monastery chancing
to meet there the same monk who had
taken my horse in charge the previous
evening i ventured to question him
as discreetly and casually as i could
regarding the ruins which were visible
from the abbey windows

  he crossed himself and a fright-

ened look came over his broad placid
face at my query

    the ruins are those of the chateau
des faussesflammes   he replied   for
untold years men say they have been
the haunt of unholy spirits of witches
and demons and festivals not to be
described or even named are held
within their walls no weapon known
to man no exorcism or holy water
has ever prevailed against these de-
mons  many brave cavaliers and
monks have disappeared amid the
shadows of faussesflammes never to
return and once it is told an abbot
of perigon went thither to make war
on the powers of evil but what befell
him at the hands of the succubi is not
known or conjectured some say that
the demons are abominable hags whose
bodies terminate in serpentine coils
others that they are women of more
than mortal beauty whose kisses are
a diabolic delight that consumes the
flesh of men with the fierceness of
hell-fire  as for me i know not
whether such tales are true but i
should not care to venture within the
walls of faussesflammes

  before he had finished speaking a
resolve had sprung to life full-born in
my mind i felt that i must go to the
chateau des faussesflammes and
learn for myself if possible all that
could be learned the impulse was im-
mediate overwhelming ineluctable
and even if i had so desired i could
no more have fought against it than
if i had been the victim of some sor-
cerers invultuation the proscrip-
tion of the abbot hilaire the strange
unfinished tale in the old manuscript
the evil legendry at which the monk
had now hinted-all these it would
seem should have served to frighten
and deter me from such a resolve
but on the contrary by some bizarre
inversion of thought they seemed to
conceal some delectable mystery to
denote a hidden world of ineffable
things of vague undreamable pleas-
ures that set my brain on fire and
made my pulses throb deliriously i


weird tales

jdid not know i could not conceive of
what these pleasures would consist
but in some mystical manner i was as
sure of their ultimate reality as the
abbot hilaire was sure of heaven

  i determined to go that very after-
noon in the absence of hilaire who
i felt instinctively might be suspi-
cious of any such intention on my
part and would surely be inimical
toward its fulfilment

  my preparations were very simple
i put in my pockets a small taper
from my room and the heel of a loaf
of bread from the refectory and mak-
ing sure that a little dagger which i
always carried was in its sheath i
left the monastery forthwith meet-
ing two of the brothers in the court-
yard i told them i was going for a
short walk in the neighboring woods
they gave me a jovial pax vobis-
cum and went upon their way in
the spirit of the words

heading as directly as i could for
faussesflammes whose turrets
were often lost behind the high and
interlacing boughs i entered the for-
est there were no paths and often i
was compelled to brief detours and
divagations by the thickness of the
underbrush in my feverous hurry to
reach the ruins it seemed hours be-
fore i came to the top of the hill which
faussesflammes surmounted but prob-
ably it was little more than thirty
minutes climbing the last declivity
of the boulder-strewn slope i came
suddenly within view of the chateau
standing close at hand in the center
of the level table which formed the
summit trees had taken root in its
broken-down walls and the ruinous
gateway that gave on the courtyard
was half-choked by bushes brambles
land nettle-plants forcing my way
through not without difficulty and
with clothing that had suffered from
the bramble-thoms i went like ge-
rard de venteillon in the old manu-
script to the northern end of the
ourt enormous evil-looking weeds

were rooted between the flagstones
rearing their thick and fleshy leaves
fthat had turned to dull sinister ma-
roons and purples with the onset of
autumn but i soon found the tri-
angular flagstone indicated in the
tale and without the slightest delay
or hesitation i pressed upon it with
my right foot

  a mad shiver a thrill of adventur-
ous triumph that was mingled with
something of trepidation leaped
through me when the great flagstone
tilted easily beneath my foot disclos-
ing dark steps of granite even as in
the story now for a moment the
vaguely hinted horrors of the monk-
ish legends became imminently real
jin my imagination and i paused be-
fore the black opening that was to en-
gulf me wondering if some satanic
spell had not drawn me thither to
perils of unknown terror and incon-
ceivable gravity

  only for a few instants however
did i hesitate then the sense of peril
faded the monkish horrors became a
fantastic dream and the charm of
things unformulable but ever closer
at hand always more readily attain-
able tightened about me like the em-
brace of amorous arms i lit my taper
i descended the stair and even as
behind gerard de venteillon the tri-
angular block of stone silently re-
sumed its place in the paving of the
court above me doubtless it was
moved by some mechanism operable
by a mans weight on one of the steps
but i did not pause to consider its
modus operandi or to wonder if there
were any way by which it could be
worked from beneath to permit my
return

  there were perhaps a dozen steps
terminating in a low narrow musty
vault that was void of anything more
substantial than ancient dust-encum-
bered cobwebs at the end a small
doorway admitted me to a second
vault that differed from the first only
in being larger and dustier i passed
through several such vaults and then
the end of the story



found myself in a long passage or
tunnel half blocked in places by
boulders or heaps of rubble that had
fallen from the crumbling sides it
was very damp and full of the noi-
some odor of stagnant waters and
subterranean mold my feet splashed
more than once in little pools and
drops fell upon me from above fetid
and foul as if they had oozed frcn a
charnel beyond the wavering circle
of light that my taper maintained it
seemed to me that the coils of dim and
shadowy serpents slithered away in
the darkness at my approach but i
could not be sure whether they really
were serpents or only the troubled
and retreating shadows seen by an
eye that was still unaccustomed to the
gloom of the vaults

  rounding a sudden turn in the pas-
sage i saw the last thing i had dreamt
of seeing-the gleam of sunlight at
what was apparently the tunnels end
i scarcely know what i had expected
to find but such an eventuation was
somehow altogether unanticipated i
hurried on in some confusion of
thought and stumbled through the
opening to find myself blinking in
the full rays of the sun

  even before i had sufficiently re-
covered my wits and my eyesight to
take note of the landscape before me
i was struck by a strange circum-
stance  though it had been early af-
ternoon when i entered the vaults
and though my passage through them
could have been a matter of no more
than a few minutes the sun was now
nearing the horizon there was also
a difference in its light which was
both brighter and mellower than the
sun i had seen above averoigne and
the sky itself was intensely blue with
no hint of autumnal pallor

  now with ever-increasing stupe-
faction i stared about me and could
find nothing familiar or even credible
in the scene upon which i had
emerged contrary to all reasonable
expectation there was no semblance
of the hill upon which faussesflammes

stood or of the adjoining country
but around me was a placid land of
rolling meadows through which a
golden-gleaming river meandered
toward a sea of deepest azure that
was visible beyond the tops of laurel-
trees    but there are no laurel-
trees in averoigne and the sea is hun-
dreds of miles away judge then my
complete confusion and dumfound-
meijt

  it was a scene of such loveliness as
i have never before beheld the
meadow-grass at my feet was softer
and more lustrous than emerald vel-
vet and was full of violets and many-
colored asphodels the dark green of
ilex-trees was mirrored in the golden
river and far away i saw the pale
gleam of a marble acropolis on a low
summit above the plain all things
bore the aspect of a mild and clement
spring that was vferging upon an
opulent summer i felt as if i had
stepped into a land of classic myth
of grecian legend and moment by
moment all surprize all wonder as to
how i could have come there was
drowned in a sense of ever-growing
ecstasy- before the utter ineffable
beauty of the landscape

  near by in a laurel-grove a white
roof shone in the late rays of the sun
i was drawn toward it by the same
allurement only far more potent and
urgent which i had felt on seeing the
forbidden manuscript and the ruins
of faussesflammes here i knew with
an esoteric certainty was the culmi-
nation of my quest the reward of all
my mad and perhaps impious curi-
osity

  as i entered the grove i heard
laughter among the trees blending
harmoniously with the low murmur
of their leaves in a soft balmy wind
i thought i saw vague forms that
melted among the boles at my ap-
proach and once a shaggy goat-like
ereature with human head and body
ran across my path as if in pursuit
of a flying nymph


weird tales

in the heart of the grove i found
a marble palace with a portico of
doric columns as i neared it i was
greeted by two women in the costume
of ancient slaves and though my
greek is of the meagerest i found no
difficulty whatever in comprehending
their speech which was of attic pur-
ity

  our mistress nycea awaits you
they told me i could no longer mar-
vel at anything but accepted my situ-
ation without question or surmise like
one who resigns himself to the prog-
ress of some delightful dream prob-
ably i thought it was a dream and
i was still lying in my bed at the
monastery but never before had i
been favored by nocturnal visions of
such clarity and surpassing loveliness

  the interior of the palace was full
of a luxury that verged upon the
barbaric and which evidently be-
longed to the period of greek deca-
dence with its intermingling of ori-
ental influences i was led through a
hallway gleaming with onyx and pol-
ished porphyry into an opulently
furnished room where on a couch of
gorgeous fabrics there reclined a
woman of goddess-like beauty

  at sight of her i trembled from
head to foot with the violence of a
strange emotion i had heard of the
sudden mad loves by which men are
seized on beholding for the first time
a certain face and form but never
before had i experienced a passion of
such intensity such all-consuming ar-
dor as the one i conceived immedi-
ately for this woman indeed it
seemed as if i had loved her for a
long time without knowing that it
was she whom i loved and without
being able to identify the nature of
my emotion or to orient the feeling in
any manner

  she was not tall but was formed
with exquisite voluptuous purity of
line and contour her eyes were of a
dark sapphire blue with molten
depths into which the soul was fain
to plunge as into the soft abysses of

a summer ocean the curve of her
lips was enigmatic a little mournful
and gravely tender as the lips of an
antique venus her hair brownish
rather than blond fell over her neck
and ears and forehead in delicious
ripples confined by a plain fillet of
silver in her expression there was a
mixture of pride and voluptuous-
ness of regal imperiousness and femi-
nine yielding her movements were
all as effortless and graceful as those
of a serpent

  i knew you would come she
murmured in the same soft-voweled
greek i had heard from the lips of
her servants i have waited for you
long but when you sought refuge
from the storm in the abbey of peri-
gon and saw the manuscript in the
secret drawer i knew that the hour
of your arrival was at hand ah you
did not dream that the spell which
drew you so irresistibly with such un-
accountable potency was the spell of
my beauty the magical allurement of
my love  

  who are you i queried i spoke
readily in greek which would have
surprized me greatly an hour before
but now i was prepared to accept
anything whatever no matter how
fantastic or preposterous as part of
the miraculous fortune the unbeliev-
able adventure which had befallen
me

  i am nycea she repliedto my
question i love you and the hos-
pitality of my palace and of my arms
is at your disposal need you know
anything more

  the slaves had disappeared i flung
myself beside the couch and kissed
the hand she offered me pouring out
protestations that were no doubt in-
coherent but were nevertheless full
of an ardor that made her smile ten-
derly

  her hand was cool to my lips but
the touch of it fired my passion i
ventured to seat myself beside her on
the couch and she did not deny my
familiarity while a soft purple twi-
the end of the story



light began to fill the comers of the
chamber we conversed happily say-
ing over and over again all the sweet
absurd litanies all the felicitous
nothings that come instinctively to
the lips of lovers she was incredibly
soft in my arms and it seemed almost
as if the completeness of her yielding
was unhindered by the presence of
bones in her lovely body

  the servants entered noiselessly
lighting rich lamps of intricately
carven gold and setting before us a
meal of spicy meats of unknown sa-
vorous fruits and potent wines but
i could eat little and while i drank
i thirsted for the sweeter wine of
nyceas mouth

ido not know when we fell asleep
but the evening had flown like an
enchanted moment heavy with felic-
ity i drifted off on a silken tide of
drowsiness and the golden lamps and
the face of nycea blurred in a bliss-
ful mist and were seen no more

  suddenly from the depths of a
slumber beyond all dreams i found
myself compelled into full wakeful-
ness for an instant i did not even
realize where i was still less what had
aroused me then i heard a footfall
in the open doorway of the room and
peering across the sleeping head of
nycea saw in the lamplight the abbot
hilaire who had paused on the
threshold a look of absolute horror
was imprinted upon his face and as
lie caught sight of me he began to
gibber in latin in tones where some-
thing of fear was blended with fanat-
ical abhorrence and hatred i saw
that he carried in his hands a large
bottle and an aspergillus i felt sure
that the bottle was full of holy water
and of course divined the use for
which it was intended

  looking at nycea i saw that she
too was awake and lmew that she was
aware of the abbots presence she
gave me a strange smile in which i
read an affectionate pity mingled

with the reassurance that a woman
offers a frightened child

  do not fear for me she whis-
pered

  foul vampire accursed lamia
she-serpent of hell thundered the
abbot suddenly as he crossed the
threshold of the room raising the as-
pergillus aloft at the same moment
nycea glided from the couch with an
unbelievable swiftness of motion and
vanished through an outer door that
gave upon the forest of laurels her
voice hovered in my ear seeming to
come from an immense distance

  farewell for awhile christophe
but have  fear you shall find me
again if you are brave and patient

  as the words ended the holy water
from the aspergillus fell on the floor
of the chamber and on the couch
where nycea had lain beside me
there was a crash as of many thun-
ders and the golden lamps went out
in a darkness that seemed full of
falling dust of raining fragments i
lost all consciousness and when i re-
covered t found myself lying on a
heap of rubble in one of the vaults i
had traversed earlier in the day with
a taper in his hand and an expres-
sion of great solicitude of infinite
pity upon his face hilaire was stoop-
ing over me beside him lay the
bottle and the dripping aspergillus

    i thank god my son that i found
you in good time he said when i
returned to the abbey this evening
and learned that you were gone i sur-
mised all that had happened i knew
you had read the accursed manuscript
in my absence and had fallen under
its baleful spell as have so many
others even to a certain reverend ab-
bot one of my predecessors all of
them alas beginning hundreds of
years ago with gerard de venteillon
have fallen victims to the lamia who
dwells in these vaults

  the lamia i questioned hardly
comprehending his words

  yes my son the beautiful nycea


weird tales

who lay in youi arras this night is a
lamia an ancient vampire who main-
tains in these noisome vaults her pal-
ace of beatific illusions how she
came to take up her abode at fausses-
flammes is not known for her coming
antedates the memory of men she is
old as paganism the greeks knew her
she was exorcised by apollonius of
tyana and if you could behold her as
she really is you would see in lieu of
her voluptuous body the folds of a
foul and monstrous serpent all those
whom she loves and admits to her hos-
pitality she devours in the end after
she has drained them of life and vigor
with the diabolic delight of her kisses
the laurel-wooded plain you saw the
ilex-bordered river the marble palace
and all the luxury therein were no
more than a satanic delusion a lovely
babble that arose from the dust and
mold of immemorial death of ancient
corruption they crumbled at the kiss
of the holy water i brought with me
when i followed you but nycea alas
has escaped and i fear she will still
survive to build again her palace of
demoniacal enchantments to commit
again and again the unspeakable
abomination of her sins

   still in a sort of stupor at the ruin
of my new-found happiness at the
singular revelations made by the ab-
bot i followed him obediently as he
led the way through the vaults of
faussesflammes he mounted the
stairway by which i had descended
and as he neared the top and was
forced to stoop a little the great
flagstone swung upward letting in
a stream of chill moonlight we
emerged and i permitted him to take
me back to the monastery

  as my brain began to clear and the
confusion into which i had been
thrown resolved itself a feeling of
resentment grew apace-a keen anger
at the interference of hilaire un-
heedful whether or not he had rescued
me from dire physical and spiritual
perils i lamented the beautiful dream
of which he had deprived me the
kisses of nycea burned softly in my
memory and i knew that whatever
she was woman or demon or serpent
there was no one in all the world who
could ever arouse in me the same love
and the same delight i took care
however to conceal my feelings from
hilaire realizing that a betrayal of
such emotions would merely lead him
to look upon me as a soul that was lost
beyond redemption

  on the morrow pleading the ur-
gency of my return home i departed
from perigon now in the library of
my fathers house near moulins i
write this account of my adventures
the memory of nycea is magically
clear ineffably dear as if she were
still beside me and still i see the rich
draperies of a midnight chamber il-
lumed by- lamps of curiously carven
gold and still i hear the words of her
farewell

  have no fear you shall find me
again if you are brave and patient

  soon i shall return to visit again
the ruins of the chateau des fausses-
flammes and redescend into the vaults
below the triangular flagstone but
in spite of the nearness of perigon
to faussesflammes in spite of my es-
teem for the abbot my gratitude for
his hospitality and my admiration for
his incomparable library i shall not
care to revisit my friend hilaire
 

luk

bs eftrtat aston-ul-

they would clutch and miss and
howl horrific ululations

foul beyond compare is lurs un-
canny coast like fiends defiling
vestal baths the mucid mountains
stand ascending sheer from pure and
dazzling depths

high are the hills the haughty
hills that hide the land of
lur like sentient things de-
moniac they stab the sad-starred sky
disdainfully defiant of the gods that
gave them birth

  beyond the far-flung syspia sea-
which lies beyond the seventh sea-
these monstrous mountains rise dark
and deformed hunchbacked with
hate they form the countrys coast
beautiful is syspia with its sobs
and its sighs and its laughter with its
dawns as red as rubies and its dusks
of darksome gold-syspia the shim-
mering glimmering but fierce and

no verdure vests those slimy steeps
which mariners from other deeps
have named the hills of hell
malignant mists play hide-and-seek
around each pompous peccant peak
where nameless horrors dwell

  yes beautiful is syspia until the
sailor nears the hills of hell whose
feet no unwrecked ship has ever
touched for when the valiant voy-
ager makes bold to reach lurs shore
the storm-gods of the mountains wake
for war their lusty legions slither
down in arrogant array with yowls
and yells they tear the tides and make
the mists into thick thunder clouds
and when the waves rise mountain-
high as to defy the lightnings leap-
ing glare and the wo-winds requiem


weird tales

reverberates the stoutest ship must
wreck upon the rocks must crash like
eggs trod on by brobdiugnagians

  it is then that

  the sea of syspia knows no calm

  no sunshine comes to bring its balm

  the wild waves sing a solemn psalm

     a dirge of death-

                 deep dirge of death

  and when the storm is over and the
shipwrecked reach the shore they find
most of their mates already there all
vitreous-eyed and strangely sadly
changed    ghosts do not linger
long beneath the waves

  and syspia softly sighing mourns
not for the newly dead her dolor-song
is for the dead-alive for lurs cold
coast is long and bare-a foul infer-
nal fringe there is no hope for those
cast there the very ghosts themselves
can not depart the devils of the
hills of hell seize all who dare as-
cend mirages mock real ships are
seen but syspia bears no sail that can
avail and so the doomed must lin-
ger on in plight that calls to death
tormented till they retrogress into
abysmal brutes urged by desireless
kindly ghosts some seek surcease of
sorrow in the sea but most of them
starve on and on for love of life is
strongest when theres little life to
love when erebus the atrous claims
the mind but comes the day when
all are gone save one-an atavism
gnawing on his final comrades bones
and then the last man dies

  strong was the craft that carried
me to lurs curse-ridden coast but
stronger were the horrors from the
hills of all the crew-good men and
true-none reached the rocks save me

  twas thus

i came to lurs unhallowed shore

where ghosts of mariners galore

cried out oh come and dream no more

  in mockery-

so frightfully

  there is no hope-what seems so
is delusion thus spoke the spectral
forms that crowded round and then

with many a sigh and sign entreated
me to share their common fate

the hours were days the days were
months the while i lingered there
once syspia cast a rotting octopus
ashore   and i did eat

  then came the glorious eastertide
when demons dare not stir and hi
that sacred season i bade all the
ghosts farewell and started out to
climb the hills of hell

  o	god the horror of that climb
they say that you created all let me
deny that lie for out of goodness
evil can not come love can not father
hate no lucifer still lives and all
his lieges from abaddon down to
zammiel

  though blinded by the easter light
that kept them in their caves the en-
tities of evil reached for me their
lurid eyes illumined with the hate of
deepest hell kept glaring glowering
at me through the gloom their ob-
scene shapes writhed in their impo-
tence they leered and jeered mad
malisons that left a sulfurous smell
envenomed echoes shook the shame-
less hills and more than once a
shedim shape would half emerge from
shadowed cell and grasp at me with
greedy gargoyle grin thank god
their hellish hideousness was only half
revealed with many a hiss theyd
clutch-and miss and missing howl
horrific ululations

  evil emanations came from every
curse-choked cave and cloaked me like
a suffocating shroud-evil adumbra-
tions that were like the ghosts of
ghosts but they could not continue
long in easters holy glow and soon
i saw them slink back to their
sources

  spite of these things i journeyed
on past crags a-creep with black
abominations past cliffs that oozed
with foulest feculence across ravines
where slimy serpents crawled like
sinuous sin i plodded on footsore and
the land of lur



spent until at last the horrors lay
behind until the hills of hell were
far above

  below me lay fair foothills undu-
lating green serene and farther on
a vast and verdant vale

  the day was near to dying when i
reached the sylvian slopes inclement
clouds half hid the sleepy sun in
search of sanctuary for the night i
chanced at length upon a clearing
wherein stood a faded fane-an an-
cient tiny temple-an ivy-shrouded
shrine with doors agape i entered
this strange refuge and sought rest
reclining on a richly cushioned pew
eldritch gleams that glimmered
through the multipictured panes sent
eery iridescence through the gloom-
the glamorous gloom that covered
aisle and apse

  outside

  the red sun turned to domes of gold

   the clouds before his vision rolled

  and sought the far horizons fold

       then cam the night

  but sleep came not with vespertime
nor with narcotic night for out of the
west the storm hordes came ferocious
frenzy-fraught and blotted out the
melancholy moon and every star-en-
gulfed the ghastly gibbous moon and
every timorous star for three long
hours the tempest tramped upon the
jtrembling hills-trod like gog and
magog on the shivering quivering
hills the lightning flashed the thun-
der crashed the wo-wind screeched
and screamed the tribulation of the
trees - the sylvan sussuration - be-
came a sob and then a threnody and
on the gale there came it seemed
howling from the heights-damna-
tions from the distant hills of hell-
a fulminous cacophony of curses and
when the wind was at its worst and
chaos seemed to beckon the holy place
that sheltered me was shaken crest to
crypt by deafening detonations crash-
ing like the crack of doom a thou-
sand thors could hardly deal such
din

louder bolder boomed the thunder
wilder did the tempest rave

    and the forest bowing under

moaned as if its soul to save

the morning came cerulean and
not a shadow stirred and in
moms ray i sought a way that led to
inmost lur

  but first my eyes were to behold a
new unholier horror the path that
pointed from the church ran through
a copse of cedars and in that wood i
found gray stones-gray slabs that
guarded empty gaping graves a va-
cant village of the dead-a tom and
tenantless necropolis

 my god i cried what can
this mean-this desecration of the
dead-this ravage that has robbed
them of their rest   

  and then to add to my amaze i
noted that each tombstone told an
enigmatic tale here lay the
body- each inscription started

  long i pondered as i paused by
those pathetic pits and mused the
more on finding several unmolested
mounds all of them new-molded and
unmarked

  at length i left the gruesome grove
and wandered on until the wood gave
way to rolling fields and here i
found vast vineyards and long lines
of fruited trees and respite from my
weariness and hunger

  my incredible journey resumed i
remarked that the roadway grew
wider but held no track nor trace of
recent travel and then as mile on
mile i trekked the trail another ab-
normality i noted throughout the
fair and fertile countryside there was
no sign of human habitation-no
house nor hut amid that husbandry

  at last the undulating land that
held the vineyards vanished i faced
a fiowei-flecked field of endless area

long i roamed through that perfumed
   prairie

  on a road that ran straight as a string-
on a beautiful bud-bordered highway

where i was the lone breathing thing

not a bird-song was heard in the hedges

not a cricket-chirp though it was spring


weird tales

   and when the saffron sunset cast its
color on the scene there came a gleam
-a beam reflected from some spot
before me and then-  thank god  
i cried in joy the journeys nearly
ended

  the coruscating light revealed a
mass of metal roofs-the tops of
homes and temples in a many-towered
town that stood out dimly in the dark-
ening distance

   the outre outlines of the place grew
plainer as i progressed and soon i
saw a scene suggestive of the long ago
-a city circled by great walls like
ancient jericho-a town of towers and
turrets that were made in massive
mold-a mecca in the mystic land of
lur

  i followed the road round the ram-
part a distance of more than a mile
and then as the daylight surrendered
to graylight i found a gargantuan
gate-an iron-paled ponderous portal
beyond which appeared languid
lights and on peering inside through
the bars i espied two cerberus-like
sentries on guard each was dighted
in hauberk and helmet and each had
a halberd in hand and on seeing me
there they cried out as in fear-cried
out as to give an alarm then they
opened the entrance and seized me
and hurried me into the town there
the people came out and sent up a
great shout of astonishment as they
surged round

  and then my captors carried me
toward a central place-a castle with
the tallest tower of all the crowd
grew greater on the way and in their
cries i sensed it seemed a gracious
note of greeting the forms and faces
of the folk were blurred as hi the
mellow-lighted street the figures
milled

  into a vast high-vaulted hall be-
neath the tower they took me-a hall
where countless candles flamed and
flickered and when the light fell on
the faces of the men of lur i shud-
dered at the shadows in their eyes   
eyes eery with the very soul of sad-

ness    hopeless heavy-lidded hor-
ror-haunted    framed in faces that
were oddly old    faces that were
ancient more than aged    sorrow-
faded rather than senile

  they were a strange and striking
lot-a pageant from the past all were
garbed in garments of a mediaeval
mode-costumes quaint quixotic col-
orful some were richly plumed and
clad in shining panoply-the knightly
legions of the land of lur the raven
robes of priests were also there

far down the hall arose a dais that
held a dazzling throne and there-
on sat a man in regal raiment-a man
whoso face made out his majesty-a
patriarchal sovereign with the saddest
face of all i noted this when to his
seat they took me i bowed and then
he bade me tell my tale

  thrice welcome to the land of
lur he said when i had finished
and welcome to the towered town
of tur greetings in my name the
name of loris lord of lur at first
we feared that you might be a devil
in disguise-a demon from the dismal
swamp of swur but now we know
you are the friend whose coming to
us was foretold in ancient ages by our
oracles

  now listen stranger to the story
of my lonely land-to the jeremiad of
my fiend-infested kingdom

    this home of horror once was fair-
est of all earthly isles vessels from
all harbors sailed the silvery syspia
sea with voyagers who come to visit
lur and once our own proud ships
touched every shore all heaven
smiled upon us till four hundred
years ago thenceforth weve heard
the hoarse laugh of all hell

  lur as you know lies farthest
from the continental lands it is the
earths most isolated isle the enti-
ties of evil which held forth on other
shores apparently knew naught of our
existence or cared not for our coun-
trys far exile and so it was till
europe learned the art of exorcism
the land op lur



then began the exodus of lucifers
dark legions-the great hegira of be-
lials hordes most of them joined in
the great migration-all the strongest
most ferocious fiends-and finally they
found the land of lur

  and thus it was our country came
to be a den of demons some of the
most malignant stayed among our
coastal mountains and formed the
guard that girdles all the isle many
wandered on until they reached the
wood of wur others settled in the
swamp of swur

  invisible at first they grew so
fearless in their new-found freedom
that shortly they assumed their
frightful forms we had no formula
with which to fight them no charm to
fling in their infernal faces they
haunted every hearth and home in
lur they seized us sought to sub-
jugate our souls our children gave
their life-blood to the blasphemous
black mass the devils held deep in the
wood of wur they preyed upon us
in our impotence till some of us
cursed deity and died we found our
only refuge in our churches

    at length our magi mastered cer-
tain methods of defense at their
behest we set up sacred cities and
walled them with a wondrous kind of
stone-a rare enchanted rock whose
strength repelled all evil forces-all
save the ghoupires of the swamp of
swur and tur became the center of
asylum the largest of our talismanic
towns then to forefend against the
fiends while working in our fields we
built small churches of the cherished
stone at points where we could readily
find refuge perhaps you saw one of
these fanes while on the trail to tur
-and marked the tombs made tenant-
less by ghoupires

  the graves the ghoupires i
exclaimed  what form of fiend are
they

  they are the most maleficent of
all the sovereign said they are a
hybrid horde among the vilest ver-

min that came to the land of lur
were ghouls and vampires from each
end of earth they mated when they
reached the swamp of swur brought
into being hells unholiest brood-the
ghastly ghoupires foulest of all fu-
sions who disinter and then devour
our dead and we are almost helpless
in their hands they mock our magic
and our priestly power but only
once a year do they appease their hid-
eous hunger-the last night in the
mournful month of mur then as-
tride great unicorns as black as sa-
tans sable they swoop upon and sack
our cemeteries and take the bodies to
the swamp of swur there the fe-
male ghoupires feast on blood-blood
which their witchcraft has made warm
again the males then satisfy their
gruesome greed-

  but why not bum the bodies i
inquired sick and a-shudder why
put them in the ground as food for
fiends

  ah he replied their ashes
have been scattered to our sorrow
unless we leave the corpses for the
demons to dig up they wreak their
wrath by ravaging our cities and seiz-
ing living lurians to devour and
when the ghoupires storm our gates
and wreck our guardian walls the
other demons rush in through the
mins    therefore the odious
cursed compromise

  the fearful night that brings the
feast of fiends is almost here but
you have  need to be troubled lur
has a lasting legend-uttered by our
oracles-that finally a voyager would
span the syspia sea land ship-
wrecked  our horror-haunted shore
and safely cross the hate-hot hills of
hell and having thus in fact defied
the fiends become invulnerable to all
their venom you are the very first
to mock the monsters of the moun-
tains  

two days i tarried in the town of
tur and visited its every tower
and turret and more than once i


weird tales

heard this moan-this mad lament of
lur

sad are the souls that dwell within
  the towered town of tur

and pity god on all of us
within the land of lur

great pity on our dead for now
  it is the month of mur

and soon the fiends must have their feast
deep in the swamp of swur
that lies beyond the darkness of
the woful wood of wur

beneath a monstrous moon i wan-
dered through the wood of wur
the god-forsaken forest that lies near
the swamp of swur-the dismal dank
that was my destination

  	god they say that you created
all let me again deny that loath-
some lie for out of goodness i re-
peat no evil thing can come deity
could not have made the denizens of
that dark wood who massed to menace
me-the sinister sardonic shapes
whose red-green eyes glared banefully
from every hole and bush - who
crowded close but dared not do me
harm and god could not have given
voice to throats that were so vile-
that thundered forth such molten
maledictions

  	saw afreets of every sort and
countless caco-demons asmodeus ap-
peared and ahriman with delv his
doting servant and pre-adamic eblis
proud as ever the furies three were
there - tesiphone alecto and ma-
gffiri so was lusty loki lord of
strife lamias looked on with blood
upon their lickerish lips graveless
lemures groaned their prayer that
they be granted rest gnomes and
goblins grinned at me and imps
joined in the diabolic jabbering of the
jinns while the werewolf flashed his
fangs i saw the incubi and succubi
and heard the heartless harpies hiss
their hunger    and over all i

sensed methought the sulfurous self
of mepliistopheles

  then to save my sanity i fled the
wood of wur intending to return at
once to tux alas i lost my way
and landed in the swamp of swur

  i wandered many a weary mile
then as the bloodshot moon was mark-
ing midnight i came upon a clearing
in the midst of the morass around
which sat the fiends whom i had faced
back in the forest the embers in
their evil eyes flamed up as they be-
held me they growled a greeting most
malevolent and cursed the powers
that protected me

  suddenly the beat of hoofs broke
through their feral fuming they
heard and gave a hellish howl of wel-
come

  and then astride their snorting
unicorns the bestial ghoupires burst
upon the scene each bore a bulky
burden that gave off a stifling stench
dismounting in the center of the
fiend-encircled space the demons
placed their plunder on the ground

  malefic was the moonlight that re-
vealed the maddening truth-that fell
upon those shrouded shrunken forms
and blasphemous the shout that shook
that vast miasmic marsh when all the
devils voiced revolting joy

  the ghoupires then began preparing
for the feast of fiends i watched
and saw the thing that rocked my rea-
son i sawr their sorcery cause the
cold cadavers to fill out-saw the
corpses move and heard them moan-
saw them jerk their joints and leap to
life-heard their shuddering shriek
of hopeless horror-saw the gloating
ghoupires pounce upon the writhing
wretches and make them ready for
their red repast 	

  thank heaven for the heavy cloud
that dimed that awful orgy thank
god for kind unconsciousness that hid
the foul finale

with which to occupy themselves-
nothing to read nothing to talk about
since all conceivable methods of
escape had been discussed and ad-
mitted hopeless nothing to do but eat
and sleep and gradually feel them-
selves breaking with the strain of
suspense

  neal especially was irritable and
nervous on him more than on the
huge scientist was weighing the mo-
notony of their imprisonment in the
kingdom of rez and when at length
the guard leader appeared with the
inevitable platter of waxy vegetable
stalks he moved savagely toward the
man as though to attack him out of
sheer longing to express himself in
violent action sanderson strode in-
offensively between them and dis-
couraged the senseless impulse with a
glance neal sat down to the table in
silence and the professor began the
regular course of exercising in which
he indulged many times daily

     three times a day we eat this fod-
der neal burst forth at last al-
ways the same abominable stuff and
always day and night we have the
same light from these infernal metal
plates blinding us-even when we try
to sleep hour after hour we walk
around these rooms always in the
same frame of mind-wondering what
rez is going to do to us and how he is
going to do it whatever it may be
i wish he would hurry and get it over
with almost anything that could
happen would be better than living in
this hell

  easy soothed the professor
frowning a little at the rising inflec-
tion in the younger mans voice
theres no use in wearing our nerves
to rags about something we cant
help

  he ceased finally from the bending
and straightening exercises and came
to the table on which was set their
meal

  and always you go through that
same set of training motions
snapped neal as though you were

going to meet rez in a test of
strength

  who knows perhaps i may
how you cant move a hand
unless he wills you to and he cer-
tainly wont allow you the freedom to
attack him

  things happen replied the pro-
fessor equably i dont know how i
can break the coma he settles over me
whenever he desires it and i dont
know whether i could overcome him
even if i could get free neverthe-
less i want to keep myself ready for
whatever may happen

  neal said nothing more for a time
a little conscious of his state of nerves
and not anxious to display them fur-
ther before this man who could keep
his own so well in hand his restless-
ness continued however and even
seemed to extend to his palate and
make the food he was eating more un-
likable than ever

    how can men continue to eat this
nauseating stuff day after day he
said finally pushing aside his portion
before he had consumed half of it
at first its absolutely tasteless
which is bad enough but after
awhile it seems to sting the roof of
your mouth and leave an acrid after-
taste pah he reached for water

  why i dont notice it answered
sanderson glancing at him with sur-
prize to me it seems neither more
nor less unpleasant than usual

  neal moodily watched him finish the
rest of his meal

  wonder what time it is he mur-
mured after awhile we dont even
know whether its night or day
cooped up in this disgusting hole the
way we are  

  the professor leaned across the
table and put his big hand on the
others shoulder a moment in a steady-
ing gesture

  watch yourself neal he urged

	 it will do you no good to fret your-
self to pieces

  neal breathed deeply and made a
perceptible effort to compose himself
the black monarch

sorry i guess im a little off my
feed today-or tonight-or which-
ever it is its probably the eternal
sameness of this evil-tasting food and
these bare stone rooms  

  sanderson calmly caught his wrist
and pressed his thumb to his pulse
the count was faster than normal
and he could feel a faint flush of
fever the disturbance of his mind
had evidently tinged the functioning
of his body to a slight extent he did
not tell neal this however

  nothing wrong with you but
nerves he said soothingly try to
smooth them down with a little ap-
plied patience until-

  the door was opened and the guard
leader appeared with the usual corps
of men stationed outside they were
curtly commanded to go with them to
the disk room

once more they walked up the
broad incline past the statue-
like guards in the base of the tower
and toward the throneroom of rez
as they climbed the broad steps neal
felt tremulous oddly weak he felt
actually ill and he could hardly keep
on his feet as they went under the
drape the guard leader held aside for
them and entered the room of the disk

  as before the room appeared to be
empty though the air was permeated
with the intangible charge of evil
magnetism that announced rez to
be not far off with the exit of the
guard leader they found themselves
moving automatically toward a metal
bench that faced the disk and seated
themselves involuntarily in answer to
the unspoken command of the devil-
ish creature wtho controlled them re-
lentlessly an instant later the cylin-
drical head appeared from behind the
curtains near the great disk and rez
strode out and stood gigantic before
them

  for a moment he faced them his
cold eyes glaring through the distort-
ing glass lenses in the helmet he
seemed to gaze hardest at neal then

he nodded stiffly and began to walk
up and down the room careless of
turning his back to them perfectly
secure in the knowledge that they
could not move unless he so willed it

  at length his featureless voice came
to them with equal clarity whether
he was right beside them or thirty feet
away

    when you were here before i men-
tioned an ambition of mine-an am-
bition having to do with the outside
world of men i am now going to
explain that reference to world rule
he paused for a moment near one of
the ancient javelins that hung on the
wall and took it down to finger its
massive blade

  as i have told you i was born in
egypt many thousands of years ago
even then during my natural lifes
span i coveted supreme power  and
when i got from the priest of isis the
secret of prolonged life i knew that
some day i would rule the world
from that distant hour till now i
have been maturing my plans

  all these centuries i have been
preparing the world to accept my
leadership this preparation has con-
sisted mainly of plunging it into
chaos and war in order to foster
hatred hatred that is the key to
my actions the lever that shall let me
control the earth men must hate
each other-race for race weak for
powerful the successful for the fail-
ures hatred alone can create de-
structive deeds and prevent the pop-
ulation of the world from joining in
powerful peace and prosperity against
me

  he faced sanderson for a moment

  you and your professor eden in
the retreat of your laboratory discov-
ered and tabulated some of the tilings
i have done to gain my ends the dis-
rupting deeds of violence and greed
performed by certain of the powerful
ones of earth who were under the slav-
ery of my disk such as-the gro-
tesque head nodded briefly to neal-
the chaos your father caused by


weird tales

mismanagement of the power that was
his

  i have directed men to acquire
criminally huge fortunes and sow dis-
astrous discontent among thousands
of poor by speculation and graft that
further impoverished them i have
caused harmful laws to be passed
idiotic social conventions to be en-
forced a thousand harassing measures
to be crammed despotically down the
throats of mankind by the fanaticism
of those in power over them and
each false step of those in power has
created more misery further fertile
ground for my ambition

  chiefest of all however in re-
ducing the world to periodic chaos
and leaving it divided against itself
and ready for my dictatorship have
been the wars for all of these i have
been responsible you know how it
has been done-through the influence
of the disk over all those near the
emanations of any pieces chipped
from its edge the instant a man
shows signs of coming leadership
among his fellows that instant he is
singled out to be presented with a
blue diamond you can see how wars
are started with kings and emperors
in my bondage

    in the sword hilt of the kaiser in
 for example placed where his
left hand touched it constantly was
one of my blue diamonds in the ink-
well of the emperor of austria
dropped there by a visiting balkan
prince who was under my domination
was a blue diamond everywhere
have been fragments of the disk sewn
in carpets of government conference
rooms worn as ornaments by unsus-
pecting financiers replacing the reg-
ular jewels in the tiny bearings of
watches and clocks set in the snuff-
box of a napoleon mounted in the
crown of a czar everywhere and by
their means i have caused the wars of
history ever increasing in magnitude
of disaster and culminating in the
great war of 

  it is only during the last century
however that i have actively ap-
proached my dream of ruling the
earth in an open manner always i
have realized that the race of man-
kind-because of its lamentable per-
sistence in revolting against despot-
ism no matter how well-meant it
might be-might object to my benev-
olent but harsh rule that has been
my stumbling-block and through the
years i have been experimenting for
a physical means of removing this
stubbornness from the minds of the
too independent human race

    those experiments are finally con-
cluded-or will be with yourselves-
and i am ready for the final step in
attaining the worlds throne he
paused before them again still finger-
ing the heavy javelin as though he had
forgotten he held it

  this last step is all planned it
will be a gigantic program of disaster
i shall break the race of mankind to
pieces and into the confusion of death
i shall step forth as the supreme
power able to bind the pieces together
again into one whole pattern with
myself at the head

  the first disaster shall be a world
war compared to which the war of
 shall seem insignificant it shall
be started by declaration of hostility
between china and america and into
the conflict shall be drawn every na-
tion on the face of the earth it will
last for over twenty years three-
fourths of the adult male population
will be killed or hopelessly crippled
by it women and children shall be
so oppressed that at its conclusion not
one human being in ten will remain
normal and capable of bringing
healthy progeny into the world think
of that for a moment and realize the
consequences after this great war
only one life in ten shall remain to
flicker uncertainly in a desolated
world and there shall be scarcely a
dwelling left intact hardly a field un-
poisoned by the chemicals of warfare
the black monarch



and neither food to eat nor fuel to
lighten the cold of winter

  the weapons of this war will be
more destructive than it is now pos-
sible to imagine working under my
unseen guidance in scores of secret
government laboratories in the differ-
ent countries are chemists with guard-
ed formulae of gases that can depopu-
late a continent in a month rays that
kill at a distance of hundreds of miles
explosive shells that can destroy half
a city at a blow oh it will be a
great triumph of science this next
war of mine

  afterward with the small rem-
nant of humanity scarcely able to
exist on their ruined earth shall come
the next step in my preparatory pro-
gram

  there will be a world-wide plague
such an epidemic as is considered im-
possible now it is all in readiness
prepared by my hands at this very
moment within half a mile of this
room there is a cave filled with hun-
dreds of thousands of small tubes-in
each tube disease for a thousand men
it is highly contagious and usually
deadly this new disease of mine whose
germs are waiting inert for the mo-
ment they shall be unleashed few of
those who escape the war shall escape
the plague

  accompanying the epidemic there
will be renewed physical disturbances
of the earths surface all over the
world inactive volcanoes shall act
again and cover the land with lava
and ashes-set in motion by the proc-
ess of vibration of which you know
i am master also by the same
means i shall produce earthquakes
tidal waves all the catastrophes of
nature that have been feared by man
since the dawn of history

  then i shall emerge from this
hole that conceals me now with men
temporarily lowered into animal help-
lessness with all the economic and in-
tellectual achievements of the ages
converted into a forgotten charred
mass i shall assume control of the

earth and proceed to rebuild it
through the centuries of life still to be
mine into whatever pattern i may
desire  

  neal turned his aching eyes on the
enormous figure that paced back and
forth before him he was in physical
agony his head felt as though it
would crack in two every muscle of
his body ached and the skin of his
hands was alternately wet with cold
perspiration and dry with fever but
ill as he was he could not let such
words as rez had flung at them go
unanswered

  its impossible he exclaimed
his voice hoarse you cant do such
things its beyond the power-

  impossible was the imperious
interruption impossible-for me
there are few things rez can not do
but i will show you i told you that
the first step in my program of dis-
aster was a gigantic war and i told
you which nations would be the first
to engage in it later drawing all other
nations into the struggle watch the
disk and i will prove my words

the light was shut off and on the
huge diamond a picture formed
showing a richly furnished confer-
ence room in it was a long oval table
covered with green felt and about
this were seated some twenty impor-
tant-looking men they were yellow-
skinned these men with intelligent
alert black eyes one of their num-
ber rose to address the rest and
instantly they prepared to hear his
words with a deference that suggested
he had great authority on his left
hand a blue diamond sullenly reflected
the light from a great globe overhead

  he began to speak emphasizing his
words with soft raps against the
green felt of the table with his
clenched fist and as his pictured lips
moved his words were reproduced by
the marvelous contralto voice the
unfamiliar language was translated
by rez in his telepathy so that it


weird tales

should be intelligible to the two who
sat watching the moving photograph

  with the first words it was appar-
ent that the gathering was a war con-
ference rapidly and succinctly a
mobilization program was sketched
out appropriations for war funds
suggested and even a date set for the
declaration of war that seemed al-
ready to have been voted for by the
majority of those present he sat
down and another rose to take his
place this one deplored the war pro-
posed and tried to talk against it a
storm of hissing drowned him out
and in less than five minutes the
proposition of the first was accepted
verbatim it was to be war-and at
once

  the picture faded from the disk to
be replaced by another of similar na-
ture this showed men of a different
race gathered about a conference table
in another land the faces seemed
familiar and neal exclaimed aloud
as the reason suddenly became appar-
ent he was gazing at the president
of the united states and his cabinet
members

  even as they watched the secre-
tary of war arose and began a speech
he urged approximately the same
measures as liad the chinese states-
man in the preceding picture and he
too proposed a war date it coincided
very nearly with the date determined
upon by those in the country across
the pacific and in the cravat of this
recognized power among the cabinet
members was a blue diamond pin

  with the unanimous vote to pass on
the measures suggested and to agitate
for war against china the meeting
closed and the disk room was again
flooded with light

  rez turned toward them

  you are satisfied now that i can
do as i say you see that i am fully
able to disarm the world for my com-
ing as surely as it lives and
breathes the whole human race will
soon come under my rule a broken
thing to be molded in my hands

oanterson stare squarely at the
 nightmare head and though his
face was white and strained there was
in his light gray eyes a flicker of the
indomitability that has set man above
the animals since the race somehow
began to exist

  youre not able to do it power-
ful as you are and entirely capable of
bringing about this wholesale destruc-
tion as i believe you to be-you will
be conquered in the end as long as
one man breathes with a spark of
humanity in his heart you will be
defied

  the glaring eyes were turned full
on him

  so i have thought was the un-
expected admission and it is with
that realization in mind that i have
been experimenting as i mentioned
to you to remove the stubborn inde-
pendence that man seems to keep even
in the hour of his greatest degrada-
tion

  the men of earth i know are not
like the men of rez here by cen-
turies of selective breeding and weed-
ing out of children not conforming to
the type i desired i have formed a
kind of subnormal man such as is a
perfect subject for a ruler like myself
my people submit to discipline with
the docility of beasts they are effi-
cient laborers and they do not dare to
think-even if enough intelligence
were left them to think with after
generations of discarding the too in-
telligent ones who happen to be born

  i was able to create this type i
demand because i started with a very
few who were held in check by my
strength and superior mentality as
their numbers grew they were re-
strained by the increasing dominance
of the inherent traits i eaused to be
bred into them but i repeat this is
an age-long process it would be im-
possible to apply it to the men of the
outer earth even after their numbers
had diminished to a twentieth by the
disasters i have ready to unleash on
them before i could reduce them all
the black monarch



to submission there would probably
be a revolt against me that might suc-
ceed by sheer majority of numbers

  there is an answer to this how-
ever if i could manage to mold the
men of earth-quickly-into the same
stupid pattern as the men of rez i
should succeed in dominating them as
easily as i do my own subjects here

  i have found a way to do this
the answer lies in chemistry and sur-
gery such as you know nothing of in
the pitiful laboratories on earth and
you two are to be the final subjects
of experimentation that will prove my
theories to be sound

  the solution of my problem has
to do with memory

  it is patriotism love ambition
such fiery sentiments that make the
men of earth different from the men
of rez who have had such emotions
carefully bred out of them there-
fore all that is necessary for me to do
before i can control men of the outer
earth is to force them to forget their
patriotism their loves their ambi-
tions if an average man could be
made to forget that he has a country
a wife a desire to rise above his fel-
lows an urge to improve himself-
and if he could still remember the
dexterities of his trade-he would be
a perfect man-machine an excellent
subject he would have mind enough
left to perform his appointed duties
with precision and not enough brain
to remember that he is an individual

  assuming then that i could make
him lose his memory as i describe-if
i were master of controlled amnesia
in other words-i could dominate him
as i chose be as stem in my rule as i
pleased and he would be unable to
recall that he had ever lived a differ-
ent life he paused as though ex-
pecting an answer but the two could
only stare at him

  well i have found the way to
control amnesia half of it is made
possible by chemistry as i have said

  i have prepared a drug that kills
all memory save that rooted in sub-

conscious instinctive habit when
it is taken it reacts on the brain in
such a way that all is forgotten except
such things as knowledge of mother
language and automatic remembrance
of any long-continued set of actions
thus if a foundryman were treated
with the drug he would continue to
be an excellent foundryman-but in
all other phases of life he would be
nothing but an infant with the body
of a man he would be a machine of
flesh and blood able to perform the
duties of his labor but an unthinking
animal in all other respects and
there you have some of my exper-
imental result

  after the war and the plague the
earthquakes and other disasters that
shall reduce mankind to a small rem-
nant of its original force gallons of
this drug will be poured by my men
into every source of drinking-water
every spring and fountain every well
and creek shall be loaded with the
agent of forgetfulness men will be-
come automatons over night and
when i appear they will tolerate my
rule as children give unthinking obe-
dience to powerful adults

  there is only one drawback to
this plan of mine the effects of the
drug are not permanent there is
nothing to prevent these adult chil-
dren from leaniing all over again and
becoming in time as they were before
hence i come to the second part of
my plan

  through centuries of surgical ex-
periments performed by myself and
the arab surgeon who shares my hos-
pitality i have been able to separate
physically the segments of the brain
devoted to performing the different
mental functions among these is
the segment of memory this is di-
vided into two parts-one whieh gov-
erns deep-seated unconscious acts
accomplished by established habit
and one whieh is responsible for con-
scious remembered acts

   you see what this means if a
brain could be exposed and dissected


weird tales

and the part of the memory segment
removed that applied to conscious
memory-you would have a creature
capable only of continuing to perform
acts of old habit such as routine of
manual work and incapable of re-
membering anything else or of ever
learning over again he would be a
puppet

  this operation i am able to per-
form i have proved it again and
again on the brains of the subjects
whom i have commanded to be ex-
perimented on in the operating-room

  thus by drug and surgery i shall
dull the minds of the few who will
continue to exist on earth and will
start there a new race such as i have
created in rez for the administered
drug shall hold men in bondage dur-
ing the years necessary to train all
remaining surgeons to the operation
i have perfected and during the en-
suing years i will need before all are
crippled by the knife before the
effects of the drug have been overcome
they shall have been made physically
incapable of ever advancing from the
state of infantile brain development

  and now we come to yourselves

the monstrous figure stopped its
pacing back and forth and stood
in front of them

  my experiments through the cen-
turies have necessarily been limited to
my own subjects here they are not
normal as compared with the men
of earth they are small-brained
dull-witted coarse-nerved therefore
while all my last experiments have
been successfully performed on them
it is barely possible that the perfected
operation might not be so satisfactory
with the finer intelligence of other
races i do not think there can be a
difference after all the brain is the
brain and difference of quality should
not materially affect its treatment
nevertheless i want to make sure
and to that end you were allowed to
find my kingdom

  you two have excellent average

minds whatever experiment might
succeed in the dissection of your
brains would also surely be successful
with your brothers in the upper world

  therefore-you are both to be
used as subjects for last experiments
with knife and drug

  under the terrible sentence finally
pronounced upon them neal felt him-
self sway dizzily on the metal bench
his illness had increased throughout
the ghastly enumeration of the plans
of rez the final words combined
with his mysterious sickness almost
downed him it was only by making
a desperate effort that he managed to
retain a remnant of consciousness

  whatever it was that affected him
did not extend to sanderson the
giant professor was straining to move
to break the invisible chains that kept
him from leaping at the throat of the
devil who stood so maddeningly near
him the muscles corded and rippled
on his arms and back and perspira-
tion stood out on his face as he tried
to break the unseen grip the effort
was useless

  the emotionless voice went on

  to you - the grotesque head
nodded at sanderson-shall be ac-
corded the privilege of submitting to
the surgical experiment from your
brain will be extracted the bit of nerve
matter the loss of which will render
you as helpless as a child with only
the body and appearance of a man
i will show you how it is to be done  

  once more the light faded from the
room and a picture appeared on the
disk-a picture of the laboratory that
was being prepared to receive this last
victim of experimentation there was
the cylindrical vacuum-inducing ma-
chine connected with tubing to the
glass bells the odd array of strangely
designed surgical instruments the
great glass block that should be the
operating-table all the parapher-
nalia deemed necessary to perform the
operation perfected by rez and the
surgeon who eight hundred years be-
fore had removed the top of the evil
the black monarch



monarchs own skull and re-covered
it with the metal hood

  there are many interesting de-
vices in this room came the voice
of rez in the darkness notice the
rinay plates for example how they
are grouped about the operating-block
and even placed to shine up through
it those plates because of the heal-
ing rays they give off are my anti-
septics and my instantaneous repair-
ing agents under them lensed as
they are an open wound begins to
heal in from eight to fourteen seconds
-a speed that admits of wonders in
the way of rejoining sundered tissues
before the blood has coagulated

  among the instruments you will
observe an invention of mine that
looks like a pair of forceps sharpened
at the ends to a cutting edge after
the scalp has been laid back over the
spot that covers the part of the brain
we want removed this device is placed
against the skull then it is turned
under pressure cutting away a cir-
cular section of bone with another
specially curved knife the section of
brain that possesses power of con-
scious memory is scooped out as one
would cut a rotten spot from an
apple immediately the blood is
sponged clear for the few seconds re-
quired by the healing power of the
rinay plates to form a surface over the
hole then the circle of living bone is
replaced in the skull the scalp is
sewn back - and in less than two
hours there is only a scar left to show
that the operation has taken place

  all that is needed is a pair of
deftly trained hands i will let you
see the man who is to operate on you  

  the picture changed and they saw
a room much like the two in which
they themselves were confined in
this a man paced dully up and down
his eyes were alternately lusterless
and gleaming on his hands were
fabric gloves as he walked back and
forth his lips moved tremulously with
soundless words now his gloved

hands were brandished as though he
were being threatened by unseen
things then he would relapse into
listlessness pacing back and forth
shoulders stooped and lips mumbling
aimlessly

  as he watched sanderson felt a
further shock of horror the wild
eyes the loose lips the maniac bran-
dishing of hands-

 hes insane he exclaimed
  hopelessly insane and this is the
man who handles the knife   

  he is the man was the emotion-
less answer as for his insanity-
what would you expect from a bril-
liant mind imprisoned solitarily for
eight centuries his insanity how-
ever does not prevent him from being
a very fine surgeon and he loves his
work with the knives    the
pause that followed was eloquent

  so much for the surgical part of
the experiment   resumed rez   now
for the drug

  he faced neal you are the sub-
ject chosen for that from you i
shall learn if the drug reacts in as sat-
isfactory a manner on the more intelli-
gent men of earth as it has reacted on
the men of rez and later-say a
year from now-you too will be put
under the knife and will undergo the
same operation   

  neal tried to rise to his feet he
seemed to be surrounded by a haze
through which he could only dimly
make out the hated form of rez-the
huge metal helmet the glaring cold
eyes over his senses was fast descend-
ing the unconsciousness he had held
off for so long but he made a last
effort

 ill never take your damned
drug he said trying to shout the
words and only succeeding in whisper-
ing them youll not experiment
with me as though i were a rat in a
dissecting-room ill kill myself be-
fore ill swallow your stuff-

  for an instant rez faced the sway-
ing figure noting the red-streaked


weird tales

eyes and the purple tint of the lips
then he delivered the sentence that
was to be the last message neal would
ever hear from him as he pro-
nounced it it is probable that he
smiled behind his metal hood-if in-
deed he had a mouth to smile with

  you have already taken it came
the soundless words in the meal
you ate before i summoned you here
the drug was sprinkled which shall
make you a child again with only the
stature of a man in about five hours
the chemical will have run its full
course 

  for a moment neal stared at him
trying to speak to shout a last defi-
ance then he slipped from the bench
and sagged to the floor at the feet of
his captor sanderson could only
gaze at the limp figure and writhe in
a rage that approached madness

  the glaring eyes were turned coldly
on him

  to insure that he will not make
away with himself in case he should
resume consciousness for an instant
before the drug has fully reacted he
will be tied as for you-there are
still a few hours left you in the pres-
ent possession of your mental facul-
ties the laboratory is not quite
ready for your reception i shall sum-
mon you when your time comes  

  he turned abruptly and approached
the curtains near the disk without
a backward look he drew them aside
entered the room behind the jewel and
replaced them to cover the doorway

  in a moment as though summoned
the guard leader appeared at the
other doorway with him were four
of the automatons of rez they bound
sanderson with fabric cords while the
spell of rez still held him powerless
and then they bore him to the rooms
that formed their prison the bound
body of neal was placed in one room
and sanderson equally trussed was
thrown on the floor of the other the
heavy metal door between was closed
and the men withdrew

	the drug of forgetfulness

sanderson strained at his fabric
bonds till the skin was tom from
his wrists and ankles but it was im-
possible for him to free himself the
knots had been tied too cunningly and
there was no slack in them for even
his huge strength to expand at
length he lay still listening for sounds
of life from neal from the other
room he could hear his heavy breath-
ing and an occasional muffled struggle
as though he too were straining at
bonds too tight to loosen occasion-
ally there was a groan and now and
then a mutter of indistinguishable
words finally the infrequent strug-
gling ceased but the muttering grew
louder until it was the raving of a
man in delirium

  incoherent phrases came to sander-
sons ears-of childhood reminiscence
of shouted defiance to rez of dreamy
mumbling about the lovely voice that
came from behind the disk now the
drugged man was speaking earnestly
to his father advising him imploring
him against the execution of some
disastrous idea now he was search-
ing again for the crevice that should
lead down to the kingdom of the evil
genius but most of all he was talk-
ing softly to the voice of the girl be-
hind the diamond

  in his raving he endowed the voice
with personality and soul and wor-
shiped it with glowing words for-
gotten was the lifeless body from
which the voice was drawn forgotten
the rigid limbs and still closed eyes
the voice remained and it was only
too apparent that the sick man had
hopelessly lost his heart to the voice
thoughts were repeated that he avould
never have spoken aloud in conscious-
ness-prayers to death to release the
spirit it held vows that in death he
would join her there lying by her
side entreaties to the monster with
the metal head to give her back to
life all other concerns were thrust
aside in the infatuation for a voice is-
the black monarch



suing from a still pallid throat and
then he was shouting defiance to rez
again threatening him laughing
planning to smash the jewel that was
the secret of his power

  shuddering the professor tried to
stop his ears to the insane raving of
the man who had been sane and well
until callously submitted to the scien-
tific experiment of the devil who
schemed to be king of the world then
he too went mad for a few moments
and struggled against the cords that
held him and shouted aloud his hatred
of the evil being who held them cap-
tive

  let him come to grips with rez but
once and after that they could do
what they liked with him in ex-
change for the pleasure of tearing at
the muscular flesh under the mon-
sters age-old skin he would give his
body to them for any torture they
could devise

  he calmed himself with an effort
and engaged again in the fruitless
planning that had occupied him since
their imprisonment

  to attack rez he must be able to
break the iron clamp of inertia with
which his enemy could freeze him at
will to break that immobility he
must smash the diamond disk but
he could not smash the disk so long as
he was held helpless by its hypnotic
exaggeration of the will of rez

  in memory he saw the screened
hole in the great throat at the base of
the metal skull he heard the slight
hiss of air inhaled and expelled with
the monsters breathing if he could
free himself from the spell of rez and
clamp his hand over that airhole-

meanwhile the moaning and de-
lirious raving from neal in the
next room had finally stopped he
was breathing heavily but evenly and
after a time the breathing grew more
and more peaceful until it could no
longer be heard over the intervening
distance neal was now untroubled

by pain-physical pain at least he
was sleeping soundly and normally
after the ordeal through which he had
passed the drug of forgetfulness had
run its course

  sanderson tried to imagine what
his comrade would be like when he
woke it all depended on the degree
of efficiency of the drug if he should
be afflicted with complete loss of mem-
ory it would be terrible indeed he
would have to learn to walk again-
to speak to perform by conscious
effort the things a child of five has
learned to do he would be a weakly
sprawling new-born infant with the
size and muscles of a man horrible 

  this however was not in accord-
ance with the plans of rez the in-
fliction of so thorough an amnesia on
him would defeat his own ends he
had indicated rather that neal would
wake to an ignorance of all his life
save that of early childhood and those
acts based on deep-rooted habit he
would be a harmless idiot a placid
case of arrested development or
perhaps--

  hope came to the professor for an
instant perhaps-he would remain
unchanged was not rez confessedly
experimenting with his drug and
would he trouble to experiment at all
if he were sure of the drugs effects
also-and the remembrance caused
him to hope further-neal had eaten
less than half of the food in which
the drug was mixed it might be that
the reaction would be correspondingly
half as strong and not lasting

  it was a slender chance but it was
something to which to cling in this
hour of the defeat of all their aims
sanderson tried to believe that it
would come true and forced his
thoughts away from the other more
dreadful surmises he relaxed his
bound muscles and waited to see if he
should be released before the hour of
his own fate in the weirdly designed
dissecting-room or if he should be
carried there still bound and helpless


weird tales

he was to have physical freedom to
the last it seemed after a long
time the outer door was unbarred and
swung open and the guard leader on
duty appeared he walked calmly to
the professor s side and unloosed the
cords then as calmly he turned his
back and walked away

  it is probable that his life was saved
by the fact that sandersons legs and
arms were numb with the cramp of
his bonds as it was while he was
trying to rise to his feet and strike the
man down in his murderous sorrow
the guard leader covered the distance
to the door the heavy metal barrier
was swung shut and the bars could be
heard grating into place

  the professor clutched at a table to
help support his uncertain body and
limped into the next room to see at
last how great had been the change
wrought by the fateful drug

  neal was still sleeping wound
around by the cords when he reached
his side with clumsy fingers he un-
did the knots and as he fumbled with
them his friend stirred at length
he opened his eyes in them could
be seen the first of the indications of
his metamorphosis

  their habitual blue seemed to have
been lightened by several shades the
whites were clearer than the whites
of maturity and they were opened
wide with curiosity expressionless
unrecognizing they stared at the
bearded face as though they had
never seen it before

  on his countenance was further
mark of the change the faint lines
of forehead and cheek the lines that
tell of adult experience as printed
words tell a message were gone-
leaving the wondering look of a child
the drug had worked as rez had
promised

  neal gazed perplexedly at the cords
that bound him then his wide eyes
came back to the big man who was
bending anxiously over him

 who are you he asked and
even his voice was so altered that san-

derson would not have recognized it
had he not known who was speaking

  i am sanderson he replied mak-
ing his answer slow and distinct in
the hope that some word should strike
a wakening note and help recall the
vanished memoiy your name is
neal emory we are in the kingdom
of rez oh my god cant you un-
derstand me

  yes-i understand what you are
saying but what does it mean what
is the kingdom of rez   

  for nearly an hour the professor
fought to restore a shade of the mind
that had been smothered by the drug
every effort was useless at the end
of that time the blue eyes looked at
him as perplexed as before and the
face was as expressionless as the face
of a puppet of rez

  there was only one ray of comfort
in his actions he parrotted the
words sanderson repeated and
seemed able to retain them in his
mind thus at the end of an hour he
had learned that his name was neal
emory that he was in the kingdom of
rez and that rez was an evil giant
who had reduced him to his present
state of helplessness

 reduced-me to my-present-
state like a child given a problem
too abstruse for its ability to solve he
stumbled over the phrase sander-
son tried to tell him what he had been
like yesterday but yesterday and the
yesterdays before that were gone from
the drugged brain as rez had said
in time he might have been taught
over again but time of course
would be denied him-he was to un-
dergo a further deadening operation
in a year

  sanderson jumped to his feet and
strode around the room hitting out
with his fists as though he felt them
sinking into the body of the inhuman
monster who had wrought this change
and neal watched him with wide
wondering eyes as though puzzled by
the violence of the big man with the
the black monarch



black beard who had been telling him
about the queer place he called the
kingdom of rez

  then shortly he picked  a piece
of the cord that had bound him and
began to tie knots in it smiling with
pleasure when he succeeded in tying
a more than usually intricate or amus-
ing one

  it was while sanderson was sadly
watching the infantile gesture that he
got the first glimmer of an idea that
sent him pacing to a table where he
could sit down bury his head in his
hands and think it out step by step
to a possible miraculous conclusion-
an idea that seemed to hold a chance
of snapping the thralldom of rez

  the professor recommenced the
hopeless-appearing circle of scheming
to attack rez he must first destroy
the hold of the disk to destroy the
disk he must break the hpnotic coma
imposed on him by the will of rez in
conjunction with the jewel do this
he could not but-perhaps neal
cotdd and point for point he worked
it out

  the power of rez was dominion of
mind-of intelligence by imposing
his will on the minds of others he
made them move or stand motionless
as he pleased however-he must
have mind to work until

  he had made the statement cas-
ually that he could not dominate an-
imals because they had no intelligence
to dominate the lower in the mental
scale a brain might be the less chance
rez had of controlling it

  here he looked at neal again in
administering the drug to him rez
had smothered all his fine intelligence
had he not perhaps unwittingly
prepared a creature capable of defy-
ing his rule here was a man with a
brain temporarily no more acute than
that of a kindergarten pupil  an
advanced animal was it possible
that this absence of a mind to control
might be the undoing of rez

  the theory was worth a try call-
ing to neal he began to coach him

as one would an infant in a task he
wanted him to do

it was some little while before neal
learned his lesson and the profes-
sor groaned at the length of time re-
quired should rez ever turn his
attention to the new occupation of his
prisoners he would learn the whole
scheme perhaps even now he was
watching them in the disk reading
his thoughts laughing at the tenuous
plan being prepared for his annihila-
tion but this was a chance that must
be risked and again and again san-
derson drilled his pupil in the course
of action he must pursue

  when we are in the room of the
disk you must stand perfectly still
until i have given you the signal
when i say now  you will pick up a
bench-a metal bench like this one i
am sitting on and ram it against the
disk as hard as you can against the
disk he reiterated it is a large
blue stone you will see at one end of
the room like this he traced a
circle with his forefinger in the nap
of the carpet do you understand
yes said neal frowning a little
when you say now i am to pick
up a metal bench like the one you are
sitting on and ram it against the
round blue stone at the end of the
room he frowned again what
does ram mean

  sanderson explained   it means to
hit as hard as you can

  i am to hit the stone with the
bench as hard as i can   neal repeat-
ed dutifully

  yes now we try it here to see
if you know what to do  

  he scratched a circle against one
wall of the room then he led neal
to the door and acted as though they
had just entered   pretend this is the
room i have been telling you about
he urged there is the round stone
-he pointed to the circle-that you
are to break

  according to the coaching he had


weird tales

received neal stood perfectly still be-
side the door now said sander-
son and at once neal picked up a
bench and moved placidly toward the
circle

  no no you must be more quick
and stand nearer the circle as soon
as you come in the door go over near
the circle well tiy it again

  once more they pretended to have
enteied the disk room neal walked
over to the circle and stood gazing in-
tently at it everything seemed right
but just before sanderson gave the
signal he paused to look at him and
remarked to himself on the intensity
of his staring

  what are you thinking about
he demanded suddenly

  i am thinking about the circle i
am to hit with the bench when you
say now answered neal

  sanderson sighed as he realized how
many fatally weak points there were
in this plan of his

  but you mustnt think about it
he expostulated patiently if you
think about it rez might know what
youre thinking-and he wouldnt let
you break the stone  

   if i dont think about it how will
i know when to break it  

    think about me and then when i
say the word you run straight to the
disk  

  i will try was the doubtful an-
swer and the rehearsal went on by
the time the guard leader came in
with their meal sanderson was satis-
fied that neal had learned his lesson
as well as could be expected there
was a chance of course that all their
woik was for nothing rez might
have turned his disk on them learned
their plans and be ready to frustrate
them he might not allow neal to
accompany him when he went again to
the tower room-if indeed he was to
go again and not be conducted di-
rectly to the laboratory without see-
ing his adversary he might order
that neal be bound before he was ad-
mitted to his presence it might even

be-and this was his most persistent
doubt-that rez could continue to
hold neal helpless with his will in
spite of the change in his brain power
however they had done everything
possible there was now nothing left
to do but to wait and see what hap-
pened

  he turned to the meal of the vege-
table and motioned neal to do the
same but before he began to eat he
cautiously tasted the stuff to see if
there were any of the drug in his own
portion as far as he could ascertain
there was none and methodically he
fed himself to conserve every atom of
his strength

hardly had they finished eating
when the guard leader appeared
with the command that they present
themselves in the disk room of rez
the professor sighed with relief as he
used the plural form they neal
was to go with him after all and
apparently unbound one possible
obstacle was thrust aside

  but as they ascended the ramp be-
side the stolid lieutenant he could not
help brooding over the other weak
points in the plan that was their last
chance if rez were prepared for the
attack or if he should be warned by
neals thought of what he must do at
the given signal or if neal should for-
get some point in the course of action
he was to follow--

  hastily he switched his mind to
other thoughts realizing that he him-
self would be the one to give mental
warning to rez if he could not con-
centrate on some other subject as
they entered the draped doorway he
was thinking resolutely what he
would do to the evil monarch if he
ever managed to close with him let
rez read that thought if he chose

  in the room of the disk they walked
unhindered to a metal bench within
ten feet of the great diamond there
sanderson felt himself clamped by
the familiar intangible bonds as
though the air around him had solidi-
the black monarch



fied and held him he glanced at
neal out of the comer of his eye he
too was motionless was it because
he was following instructions to stand
perfectly still or was he-

  desperately sanderson turned his
betraying thoughts to other channels
lest rez should read them and be
warned of the attempt against him
and then the curtains were drawn
aside and he saw the detestable cylin-
drical head carelessly seiene in the
knowledge that his prisoners could
not move against his will the great
figure strode toward them and halted
almost within reach

one of the most difficult of all
things to control is a mans own
thoughts confronted with the neces-
sity of thinking of anything else in
the world but the plan which was
about to be tried the piofessor bit his
lips in an effort to keep his mind on
other subjects under the glare of
those chill distorted eyes as rez stood
before them he must keep his brain a
blank to the doubts and fears the sus-
pense of neals-

  here he stopped himself again
even doubts and fears would expose
to the mind of rez their plot   

  you are thinking of some plot
rez snapped him up still staring at
his captive and you are thinking
that you must not harbor its details
in your mind for fear i will read the
thought and be warned is that not
right 

  sanderson did not reply he closed
his eyes and with attempted self-con-
trol directed his thoughts on the
disk and what he would do if it were
broken

    it will never be broken   rez an-
swered as though he had spoken
aloud lie turned his back to them
and began to pace slowly up and
down the big room while he flashed his
words by telepathy

  it is amazing how men of your
caliber can cling to foolish hopes you
would accomplish the impossible at-

tain the unattainable conquer the un-
conquerable and with all your in-
telligence you are too stupid to know
when you are beaten

  for years you and eden worked
to discover me you finally succeed-
ed at the same time you discovered
unmistakably that i was far more
powerful than any other on earth
yet with the knowledge ever in your
mind that you were hopelessly out-
classed you persisted in planning my
destruction

  arrived near my subterranean
kingdom you searched for weeks to
find an entrance you failed day
after day you must have known that
you would never find it if i chose to
keep you from it you must have de-
cided that i knew your plans and your
intentions of hunting me out and that
i should never let you accomplish
those plans if i could help it yet you
continued to search refusing to admit
that you were sure to be baffled

  i caused an entrance to be laid
bare to you it must have been ap-
parent that it was a trap yet you
walked in and eventually came before
me

  you saw me as yoxi see me now
and found out that you were not only
my inferior physically-but that you
were unable even to move in my di-
rection my will holds you firmly
yet realizing to the full that you aie
beaten you refuse to admit it you
stand there trying to keep your mind
from some futile plot you have con-
trived

  up and down the room went the
gigantic figure the metal hood turn-
ing stiffly with the motion of the shoul-
ders now he was right beside them
now thirty feet away sanderson un-
able even to turn his head followed
his movements with his eyes thirty
feet away   

  and what is the result of your
years of training your life of self-
denial your labor to uncover my hid-
ing-place the words rolled on the
result is comic as a reward you


weird tales

stand before me on the brink of sub-
mitting to a brain operation that shall
make you a pitiful mindless thing-a
machine helpless until i tell you what
tasks you shall perform for me and
your companion stands beside you re-
duced to the mental status of a five-
year-old child a victim of one of my
chemical experiments  

  hardly heeding the taunting words
in his effort to control his thought
sanderson gazed fascinated at the
careless way the great figure moved
about the room now almost in reach
-now yards away it would take
several seconds to retrace that dis-
tance   

  as for interfering with my world
rulership ambition-your puny ef-
forts have been even more amusing
this very day from the time you were
carried out of here until a moment
before you returned in answer to my
command i have received fresh proof
from the disk that my world war is
almost ready to be inaugurated i
have reviewed the decisions of twenty
conferences in as many different na-
tions each has determined to declare

war as soon as china or america shall
touch a match to the powder pile
the professor stared grimly at the
airhole in the base of the heavy
throat superman as rez was in brain
and body he was yet mortal a few
seconds without air and he wtould
twist and gasp as any lesser man
might do

  and now he was coming toward
them in a moment he would be near
-then he would wheel and walk to
the other end of the room   

    soon you will be led from here to
the laboratory which is now ready to
receive you after the operation and
its confirmation of my brain theories
i shall start the cataclysm i have pre-
pared china shall open hostil-
ities-

  he was nearly at the end of the
chamber a few more paces and
he would turn again thirty feet
away   

  the time had eome

 now snapped sanderson to
neal his voice cracking on the ward
now

the thrilling conclusion of this story will be told
in next months weird tales
a tall broad-shouldered man-
shadow was walking with ours

my father would have been
a great scientist if he had
lived my mother told me
that and thought so but there were
others who thought so too-a man
with keen eyes and a clipped beard
who used to visit our house and a
carelessly dressed short stout woman
whose name amounted to something
and one or two others my father
who died when i was only a year old
had coined the phrase light-echoes
in connection with some physical-
chemical theories which had the ein-
stein theory for a jumping-off point
those theories involving light-echoes
were never proved and they make
rather heavy reading but they stand
back of the love story i am writing
down and ill try to make them clear
as i go along

  there can be no end to a story of

true love-i have reason to know
yet this particular love story would
be said by most people to have ended
six years before the time i have to
write about in that strangest year of
my life when i was seven

  i remember sitting in my little
room upstairs and listening to my
mother as she talked with a friend
down on the porch below i had
stayed up there because i was in an
indigo mood which i wanted to hide
from my mother we two loved each
other in a tender way that somehow
hurt it was as if we were forever
trying to shield each other from some
bitter pain of loss that loss i had
understood for years was the loss of
my father i might have forgotten
the ache to have a father as other
children had if i hadnt always been
reminded of it by mothers smile


weird tales

that smile looked too much like what
it was-a way to keep from crying i
had been far too young to understand
when first she wore it for me-but
now i did

  little sheila is lonesome since
she back from visiting her cousins
i always meant her to have at least
one brother or sister-ive always
pitied only children well ive made
a fight for it havent i helena ive
tried to and i love sheila inexpress-
ibly but to be separated from
michael year after year after year
how can i make sheila happy when
im not god meant every child to
have a happy mother

  if id a nice sum of money to
leave her i think id-join michael
some wav i would only-only-if i
killed myself my punishment might
be to lose my way-to lose him for-
ever and besides if i cant make
sheila happy at least i can work for
her i wish she were one of my sis-
ters brood shed grow up happy
like them-be more apt to marry hap-
pily i believe-to find her souls
eternal mate as i found mine in
michael

  my mothers friend was breaking in
with little soothing soiuids and saying
dont dinorah i squared my
small shoulders and started down the
stairs as i passed the long mirror in
the hall i recognized the look on my
childish face-a replica of that look
of my mothers face that hurt my
heart i too was smiling to keep
from crying

  after the friend had gone i
dragged my mother into the house to
sing for me she had a beautiful
coloratura voice whieh she would use
only for me already she was teach-
ing me to sing-little tuneful songs
that couldnt hurt a childs unformed
voice but she would sing all kinds
of difficult things for me-the polo-
tiaise from mignon and the shadow
song from dinorah from which my
grandmother had taken mothers

name i begged for the shadow song
this afternoon and got it

  it fired my imagination and i
didnt care to ask for other songs in-
stead i drew my mother out of doors
to walk in the garden and there i
danced around her pixy-like-pre-
tending that i was the light flitting
shadow in the song i made myself
dizzy and stopped at her side cling-
ing to her hand to steady myself
and after a minute my eyes must still
have been swimming for suddenly i
cried out loudly and turned to look
behind us leaning across my mother
and peering excitedly

  her hand was on my tousled hair
in its caressing protecting way and
her voice was in my ear and there
was no one in the garden but us two
but to her questions i replied half
ashamed of my excitement yet in-
sistently

   there was a man walking beside
you mother or else coming up from
behind us on the other side from me
no i didnt see him at all-just his
shadow yes it was as plain as our
two shadows going on before us a
tall broad-shouldered man-shadow
walking with yours  

  i can see my mother yet as she
looked then she had turned too and
the late slanting sunlight fell upon
her face and made a shining halo of
her bobbed silver hair how unusual
she must have been with her face of
a child and her hair but there was
a new thing in her smile something
poignantly wistful and fearfully
hopeful that made my heart beat hard
with excitement

  sheila-youre sure-youre cer-
tain she kept saying and then
youre seven youre old enough to
understand i think and you and i
should be so close together-out of all
the world we were his-we are his 
she corrected firmly   i used to keep
a diary sheila and tomorrow im
going to show it to you and youve
heard professor ambler and miss
light-echoes



weir speak of your fathers theories
im going to tell you about some of
them too

  i remember that when i fell asleep
that night i no longer missed my
cousins there was a new feeling in
our house it was as if all the clocks
had been stopped ever since i could
remember-and were set going again

nphe next evening my mother called

	me into her room she took two
books out of a drawer of her desk and
we sat down together on the floor i
could read of course-i was far ad-
vanced for a child of seven because
mother had taught me evenings and
holidays to read and write paint and
sing for the joy of it but tonight
she read to me in a voice that was
steady by an effort by the light of
her rose- and pearl-shaded light i
have the pages from which she read
before me now as i write she read
first from her diary and she read
backward beginning with the more
recently written parts i was sur-
prized and thrilled to hear first a
description of yesterdays scene in our
garden

  then she read a few brief descrip-
tions of things i remembered little
doings and sayings of mine she was
leading my mind back through my
earlier childhood back toward my
infancy

  do you remember she would
ask and i would nod or shake my
head it got so that i generally had
to shake it and she would sigh a
little but she had gone as far back
as my second birthday now and my
memories were very slight i thought
i could remember a tiny cake with
jnst two pink candles on it but what
followed i did not recall at all i have
the page before me

  after sheila blew out her two
candles a strange thing happened
my heart is singing dear michael is
the veil wearing thin-is it to be rent
at last after this weary year

  i was sitting a little while in the
     w t-

west window of my room sheila play-
ing at my feet and running around
the room her bedtime in a few mo-
ments-yet i must have fallen asleep

  sheilas cry woke me suddenly

muwer-muwer who is he why
does he kits your hair

  startled and dazed i looked at
sheila she wasnt looking at me
she seemed to be staring at my re-
flection in the window but as i fol-
lowed her gaze she ran to me and so

i	could see our two reflections there
bright in the light of my lamp it
was a pretty picture too but sheila
saw something else-something that i
didnt see for she cried again he
likes to see us together like this-
doesnt he muwer as he goes away
he smiles

  i looked-i strained my eyes
michael-could it be-your  light-
echoes  but why couldnt i see you
too why once when you were liv-
ing i saw you with something like
what the scotch eall second sight
cant i see you now because im
grief-blinded  or because if i saw
you i must go to you

  and i must stay with sheila dear
little sheila yours and like you
mine to keep safe for you till she
doesnt need me so much

  but if only you could come to me
so that i could see you michael oh
michael my love

  i	have written it as my mother had
written it in reading it to me that
night she improvised as she did when
she read blood-eurdling nursery tales
-making her pitiful little diary
sound less sad

  and after that she skipped quite a
section of pages turning them over
as though she herself could not bear
to look at them her face was pale

  im going back to the time before
your fathers death she explained
quickly heres the thing i was
looking for about seeing him with
second sight  

and this next she read in a happier


weird tales

tone a tone which seemed to belong
to happier days

  last night a strange thing hap-
pened michael and i had been on the
way to having a quarrel no use
putting down the reason but i felt
quite worked up and it might have
been a serious quarrel-but all at once
a phrase came into my mind as
though someone had said it to me
the heart in my bosom is not my
own i think i had read it some-
where but only those words came to
my mind without their context

  well they seemed to describe my
marriage to michael as no other
words could when we were first mar-
ried i dreamed one night that some-
how we exchanged souls afterward
we often dreamed the same dream to-
gether-and even things of a stranger
nature were always happening to us

i	was away on a visit once and had
a cinder in my eye but i didnt men-
tion it in writing to michael for fear
that it would worry him one night
at last i slept it out and after
that i wrote him about it and how i
had feared that i would have to go
to an optician it developed that on
the night when the cinder disappeared
from my eye michael had dreamed
of me and-of taking something out
of my eye

  the quarrel between us vanished
like a wisp of cloud before the sun i
was in the kitchen that night just
before i went to bed suddenly i saw
a very clear reflection of michael in
the kitchen window he was in bed
reading and as i looked at his re-
flection he put down the book turned
on his elbow toward me and smiled
the light seemed to shift somehow
and the reflection vanished but in
the moment of its vanishing i was
conscious of an odd sensation a feel-
ing as though i had been spying on
michael in some unusual and very
out-of-the-ordinary way that was
the more peculiar because in all our
married life i was never at any other
time conscious of such a feeling

  i stood there thinking i couldnt

see how the reflection had gotten
there anyway the kitchen and bed-
room windows were parallel-we were
occupying a small apartment-and
any windows opposing them didnt
seem to be rightly placed to throw
the image

  at any rate michael would be
interested ho knew all about reflec-
tions he would explain this one he
had smiled in my direction as i saw
him in the window but had his eyes
met mine  had he seen me too 

  	 i ran into the bedroom  michael 

i	cried did you see me in the win-
dow-my reflection  as i saw yours  
in what window michael asked
quietly a reflection thrown hi some
roundabout way from the bedroom
into the kitchen window i explained
michael said gently look at the
bedroom windows they are as they
have been all evening

  i looked at the windows they
were shuttered on the inside i began
to tremble i felt as though i were
losing my mind but michael i

saw you- i told him how he had

laid down his book and turned in my
direction and smiled michael im
-scared am i crazy what was it
what does it mean

  michael smiled-as he had smiled
at me from the window  i think  he
said softly  i think it means that you
love me very much-so much that
your senses are quickened for i did
exactly what you saw me do i heard
your footstep in the kitchen and from
somewhere i heard a scuffling noise
perhaps a rat inside the walls or
something anyhow i turned to lis-
ten-wondering if you were all right
then somehow i felt that you were-
and i remember that i smiled-think-
ing how much i loved you 

   the heart in my bosom is not
my own michael how i love you-
how you love me if one of us were
to die i know the other could not
live
light-echoes



my mother closed the book quick-
ly i wont read you about the
light-echoes no one understands them
except a little bit ill try to explain
the little i understand myself by
drawing some pictures   she said

  she drew a straight line and tried
to make me understand it as a one-
dimensional world then she drew a
square and a circle-two-dimensional
figures and then sketched in a cube
by rolling a ball smoothly and mak-
ing it skip she tried to show me how
a thing could vanish by passing into
a new dimension  you see where the
ball would have rolled to theres no
ball but the ball passed exactly over
that spot-through the air if you
lived in just two dimensions on the
floor there youd say there was no
ball but it was existing all the time
do you understand that

   	 i-think so  i said doubtfully
well do you understand that if
there is a fourth dimension-and if
we arent fitted out with the senses or
the understanding or something to
see into that fourth dimension-do
you see its the same thing-sort of
mother and i might have been two
little girls puzzling over a knotty
problem in home-work her pretty
silver hair might have been tow-hair
supposing she werent my mother at
all but the sister i knew in the bottom
of my heart id rather have now
gang age my mother called me
didnt she

  i snapped back to the question of
the dimensions i thought intensely
hastily yes of course if there were
a fourth dimension and we couldnt

see into it or understand it-

  yes wed think things werent
when maybe they were even when
they were quite near

  youre quick and clever like your
father mother approved and
heres something more sheila at
night you cant see things but even
at night theres some light and there
are the things your eyes cant see
them thats all-because they are too

crude and there are more colors in
the rainbow than you can see your
eyes dont understand how to see
them

  i twisted my foot inside my shoe
and ran my fingers through the back
of my hair my mother understood
that i was interested and yet that it
was hard for me to listen long and
think hard her hand joined my
hand hi ruffling my hair

  sheila she whispered i dont
think people die i think conscious-
ness-individuality--deep thought-
love most of all-those are the real
things and-they cant die this floor
we sit on is an illusion really-a great
emptiness filled with tiny moving
specks of energy-those arent just
the right words but they  do when
your father died the part of him that
people saw with their crude eyes-that

part was destroyed-it became-

she shivered there was a dark look
on her face but then a light shone
through

  your father-my michael she
went on was a being made of other
things than carbon and hydrogen
brilliant intellect-humor-love-his
dark eyes with the love in them the
mouth with its firm and tender look
and its little twists of happiness and
laughter-they still must be so i be-
lieve in an astral body-and i dont
know exactly what i mean by that
except that it lives on the bible
says when this corruption puts on
incorruption  your father believed
in immortality and he was a very
clever man and a sound physicist of
the new school

  now the light-echoes your father
believed that everything that exists
for us in three dimensions exists also
in four and that on rare occasions
when people see things that simply
arent there they are really seeing
queer reflections from that fourth
dimension he called these reflections
light-echoes to distinguish them from
ordinary reflections or ordinary light
according to einstem and other


weird tales

physicists nothing can travel faster
than light-but your -father thought
that some matter vibrations and some
light vibrations do travel faster than
that maximum known speed and can
not be perceived or detected because
they are projected by their very speed
-or bounced as the bail was bounced
into the fourth dimension light-
echoes travel faster than light as we
know it in ourthree dimensions

  i saw your fathers image through
closed shutters and in a way no
ordinary reflection could be seen be-
cause my senses were quickened by
love and i caught a fleeting glimpse
of his image as it was projected in
the fourth dimension and for an in-
stant reflected or echoed back into
the dimensions i knew

  and it should be possible to see
him now in that way though i cant
do it it should be possible for he
isnt dead he has slipped away into
that fourth dimension-into that un-
known dimension of einsteins that
reforms space so that it is boundless
but not limitless where the spiral
courses of the planets round their
suns are the shortest paths between
two points  

  my childish brain was reeling-and
surely no wonder i am conscious that
i have helped out the recording of this
last tremendously from later knowl-
edge  but i remember well the thrill
of that night i seemed to see a great
dark emptiness which was space
managing to conceal its queer shape
and strange dimensions-yet in which
i caught glimpses-great balls of fire
swinging along and glowing smaller
balls going in circles to go straight-
and somewhere in the mighty mystery
were the deathless dead near and yet
far from us vividly vital in some
mysterious way we couldnt compre-
hend and the deathless dead still
loved and smiled-yes they must i
seemed now to remember a tender
manly dark face in that west window
long ago-seeing me in my mothers

arms-loving us both with dear dark
eyes 

   i stirred

  mother still knelt on the floor fac-
ing me she might have been kneeling
to me

  	 sheila-you did see him that time
when you were a baby and lately
you saw-i think you saw his shadow
you seem to see things ive forgotten
how to see though when he lived-

  anyway youll tell me-the least
little thing wont you-little love i
feel hes come near to us again and
maybe if i saw him id die of joy-
but it wouldnt be that way with you
so perhaps thats why it is permitted
you to see him youll tell me any-
thing you dont understand-big or
little you wont forget

it has happened in the later years
that i followed in my fathers foot-
steps for i like my mother married a
brilliant physicist and unlike her i
have worked with my husband i
could help out more fully from later
knowledge my childish remembrance
of my mothers attempt to explain
her michaels theories to me-but why
should i  those theories would make
dull reading and they were never
proved always they came against an
unknown factor that made them im-
provable but with regard to the
speed of light i will quote part of a
paragraph and a sentence from a very
fascinating book-the nature of the
physical world by eddington

  the speed of  kilometers per
second which occupies a unique position in
every measure-system is commonly referred
to as the speed of light but it is mucb
more than that it is the speed at which tha
mass of matter becomes infinite lengths con-
tract to zero clocks stand still   

      we almost feel it a challenge to find
something that goes faster

  the light-echoes then were glimpses
caught and reflected in terms of light
rays of the speed we comprehend
from those unfound vibrations which
do move faster and the life that goes
light-echoes



 on after a thing has died is lived in
 faster tempo and more vibrantly than
 we can imagine life to live it may
 also be indestructible-on the prin-
 ciple that a brightly burning flame
 bums on as long as there is anything
 to feed it while a slow and murkily
 burning light gutters and goes out

   as i see it now the life of the
 liberated soul is anything but the dim
 and shadowy existence of the ancient
 conception of ghosts in hades and
 into that more vivid and vital life he
 had gone   

    i see it so now but at that age i
 should not have been plunged so sud-
 denly into speculations of this order
 and i was to suffer for it for a while

 on the day after that serious talk
 with my mother she went back to
 her work in the office in which she
 was employed as a secretary and i
 sneaked into her room and took the
 diary out of the private drawer of her
 desk and fell to poring over those
 portions of it which i knew she did
 not want me to see

   i make no excuses i am simply
 narrating facts i was a child and i
 was curious and at the same time i

-	think i had some idea of standing in
 my vanished fathers place of pen-
 etrating into the secret lonely places
 of my mothers soul of learning to
 shield her from her unhappiness

    that diary is before me again now
 but i will quote only one section of
 it-the first that was written after my
 fathers sudden death

    it reads like a letter no like an
 exchange of letters

   michael-how could you leave
 me  how can you not have waited for
 me to go from me while i visited
 my old home-if i had been with you
 in our home surely i could have some-
 how held you

   but i was coming to you the next
 week and you didnt wait michael
 do you forgive me because you died
 alone 

   and do you live-somewhere-

somehow the ground is cold-you
loved sunlight and warmth is there
another you-a living eternal inde-
structible you-as all good people be-
lieve-or do they lord i believe
help thou my unbelief michael if
there could be one word from you-
one word out of the black empti-
ness   

  and michael why havent i fol-
lowed you the ground wouldnt be
cold if we were together only to be
together in death as in life our
baby-oh yes-but what is even she
to me beside that which we were to
each other

   dont belong with the living
that is not an idle sentence i know
that my heart is dead heart failure
took you from me but the beait in
my bosom is not my own that is as
true now as it was before this awful
thing happened

  when they told me you were gone
-i felt my heart die there is no
feeling like that then i went on as
ive heard a man may run shot
through the heart but i dont stop
and yet my heart is dead how can
this be and i feel as though even
my soul must die without one sign
from you 

  there was a space and then a
different handwriting - a strongly
characterized eccentric hand before
reading on i sat still studying it
where had i seen that writing those
ts and the tails to the gs and ys
i thought-on the backs of some en-
velopes of letters mother kept in a box
-the letters my father had written
her

  you will finish what i had to
leave undone to leave-loving as i
love you and little sheila and yet-
dont think me cruel-but i see so
clearly the rapture of the meeting-
and time does not appear to me as it
appears to you

  yes there is a living michael who
loves you do you know the else-
where of einsteins spaee-time
maybe you dont little love you left


weird tales

that heavy stuff for me but in
another dimension where broken
things are joined together that else-
where is not far from you

 do you remember my light-
echoes they flash rare signals from
that elsewhere

  when you sing tostis vorrei
think of me then seeing you bending
down to you-and to be seen by you
again little love but not for a while
yet

  when lights paint images against
dark window-panes or colors slant
across a still water surface or when a
crystal or a prism flashes its fire-
think of my light-echoes maybe after
all you can catch a glimpse of me
watching over you and loving you
the things seen in crystals by me-
diums with their quickened vision are
light-echoes why shouldnt you some-
time see-unless then you couldnt
stay with sheila

  you say it is hard to live when
your heart is dead you and i are
one and so i know but sheila how
we have loved her-and how she needs
you now

  be patient dinorah hope

  after that there was a long empty
space-whole blank pages and then
one little sentence michael-wont
you write again

  then more blank pages and after
a while the diary taken up again
mostly with entries of my baby ways
and doings

  i closed the book softly and put it
away again in the drawer of my
mothers desk and for a long while
i sat there on the floor

 think my mother saw somehow
that her diary had been tampered
with for after all she made no more
confidences to me and on my side i
had nothing to tell her i never saw
an unaccounted-for shadow again
day after day i saw nothing at all
out of the ordinary

  but i thought more than was good
for me and one day i overheard her

talking about me again this time to
the stout miss weir who was a physi-
cal chemist of some distinction and
who had known my father

  i saw i had made a mistake in
talking to her about-about the things
i think over so much she must be a
child-all child i wish she had chil-
dren around her ill not try to draw
too near to her again im sure it
isnt right

  miss weir stayed with us that eve-
ning to dinner and that was the last
time i ever saw her for she was
taken ill with acute appendicitis a
week afterward and she died under
the knife

  i was terribly distressed and op-
pressed by all this my childish
thoughts had already been dwelling
too much upon death and now i had
the feeling that death was all around
-invisible but reaching after people
charybdis-like-or was it scylla who
reached and charybdis who sucked
either simile would have described
my childish horrors well enough and
either simile might describe well
enough to any mind the pitiless war-
fare of death against mortal existence
at any rate i grew afraid to enter a
dark room alone

  and it was just at that time with
my mother brooding over me and me
brooding over her and both of us sens-
ing the barrier between us as though
indeed my mother herself belonged
more to that unseen world of my fear
than to the world in which we lived
that we had our great surprize

  miss weir had died possessed of
quite a little fortune and she had
been quite alone in the world the
fortune was left to my mother and
after her to me

  mother was delighted for me and
i wondered child fashion and hope-
fully if this spurt of material good
fortune might be miraculously the be-
ginning of an era of real happiness
for us both but that very first night
of the good news when she tucked
me into bed i knew better
light-echoes



  im so glad for you sheila true
youll still be too alone little only
child but money makes you safe 
wonder-but there are so many ways
in which a child-a girl even a grown
woman may need her mother very
badly

  she was so transparent and hon-
estly without meaning to be trying
to hide her unhappiness from me yet
letting me see into the depths of it as
you can count the pebbles at the bot-
tom of a deep clear pool

 i knew what that i wonder
meant it meant now couldnt i
go to him  and is it such a dreadful
thing to enter that next world without
an invitation

  half the night a most unchildlike
insomnia claimed me my mother
loved me but she would always love
my father more-and he wasnt alive
as we were i wished i had someone

-or some ones-near me who were
all-alive who like myself shrank
from that other world instead of
yearning toward it

the days passed slowly my mother
had stopped her work and stayed
at home with me but we werent
happy at all we tried too hard to be

  and then came the twenty-sixth of
october the date was the anniver-
sary of my fathers death

  again i had slept very badly i had
spent the day before with the flock of
cousins i adored and the oldest boy
had told the rest of us ghost stories
then sari the oldest girl had seen
my fear and comforted me sari was
the image of my mother if you could
have- imagined my mothers prema-
turely whitened hair turned back to
coppery brown and her face lit by
the healthy happiness children love
it seems to me much as i hated my-
self for the disloyalty that sari was
more like my mother as she ought to
be somehow than my mother herself
-and that if i were always near sari
i would be always happy one of

those strange and strong child attrac-
tions drew me to her

  after coming home to our house
the glow of well-being fell away from
me and the terror of the ghost stories
came back in my bed i mused upon
them there was the tale of the
golden arm in it a corpse had
crept out of the graveyard mold and
come after the arm which had been
stolen from it and that reminded
me of the writing in my mothers
little book-the writing just before
the blank pages and her entry
michael wont you write again

  horror of horrors did my fathers
corpse leave its coffin perhaps and
creep out of the ground and come
hovering near her-and near me
had it written in that book with its
dead hand

  the dreams that followed my wak-
ing thoughts were nightmarish too
but at last daylight came

  and all that day-how i hate to
remember it-i stayed as far from
my mother as i could i had come to
associate her with the dead and with
death and i was in that phase which
sometimes smites children with a sick
nausea of connecting the idea of
death closely and entirely with the
horrors of the grave

  all that day i shunned my mother
and i think she saw it and yet in
the lamplit hour-how gladly i re-
member that-i was drawn back to
her it was almost as though a
kindly influence led me to her as
though someone who understood the
mainsprings of my being better than
i did had touched me with a tender
hand and somehow allayed all my
morbid misery

  i have seen a child cross and peev-
ish and unreconciled to its mother
after a long and wearing day newly
enraptured with her and with life 
the return of its father in the evening
-because of the sense of completeness
that filled the home with his coming
and looking back i seem to have be-
haved that night like such a child i


weird tales

felt happy again as i had felt on the
afternoon when i had seen the shadow
-and never since

  but let me write now carefully
what is to follow because-in that
newer fuller science which is just
dawning on the minds of men such
rare data are of the greatest value

  i had come into my mothers room
she sat by the closed west window
reading the rose- and pearl-tinted
shade of the lamp beside her blos-
somed like a flower in the dark win-
dow-pane where she too was reflected
in a mellow glow

  i sat upon the floor i had a school
text-book which i was pretending to
study-but i was really watching her
i loved her in that moment tremen-
dously i felt as though we were
completed-happy as other mothers
and children there was a happy
light upon her face it was a moment
of rare and perfect beauty-and
child that i was i had learned a sad
wisdom which whispered to me that
the moment could not last

  and then i heard my mother sing-
ing very softly though her lips did
not seem to move the song which
i thought was the loveliest thing i had
ever heard seemed to come from a
long way off-almost like an echo
she must be humming very softly and
yet somehow words reached my ears
too-and i wondered how she could
eay them without moving her lips

the winter may come and the spring may
     die   

god bless thee wheneer at his feet thou
     dost kneel   

 if thou come not soon love then i shall
      meet thee there

  my voice sounded crude and shrill
after that mother what were you
binging

  nothing dear i wasnt singing at
all

  i thought it was your voice but
it sounded far away someone else
somewhere maybe

  what did it sound like

  i tried to sing what i remembered

mothers head bent down so that i
couldnt see her face her voice
trembled ever so slightly but i
thought not with unhappiness

  that was michaels favorite song
sheila it is solveigs song from
peer gynt some day you must see
and hear peer gynt i have never
had the heart to sing it since he died
-but i used to sing it just as you
did now-with a certain odd little
mistake in the refrain after a
pause she added michael believed-
too-that sound vibrations never die
-that sometimes they may circle
around in space and come back like
a homing bird-or like that boome-
rang you made in handicraft class

  i was greatly touched and awed
all those horrors were forgotten my
father had been a wonderful man to
have known such things as that won-
derful even to have thought them

  mothers face was still bent down
and turned away but i could see it
shining dimly in that dark window-
pane i sat still gazing at that win-
dow-picture thinking long child
thoughts

  the light seemed stronger in that
reflected world it seemed to focus on
my mothers face and figure yet some-
how to be broken up like light from
a prism but there was no prism hi
the room anyhow it made a sort of
rainbow-misty brightness clear be-
hind a veil

  and-now-if cold chills coursed
up my spine they were not chills of
fright but of the most exquisite ex-
citement i was seeing something
very strange indeed-a thing that in-
stantly recalled that passage in my
mothers diary describing how in a
pane of window-glass she had seen a
thing that took place but which she
couldnt possibly see there

  only i was seeing something which
-wasnt taking place or was if
there was that other diary passage
about my own baby vision

  there now sat my mother in her
willow rocking-chair i noticed that
light-echoes



her hand was pressed against her left
side-was there a pain there 

  anyhow there was nothing in her
arms-her arms were empty and so
was her lap

  but her reflected image in the win-
dow held a baby in its arms snuggled
a small dark head close against its
breast

 mother i breathed what
baby ever had hair growing in a little
downward point on its forehead did
i ever see one

  mother answered absently and a
little jerkily it isnt-common but
you had a little widows peak your
bangs hide it and you seemed to-
outgrow it too

  the picture in the window trem-
bled as though a light had shifted
or did excitement blur my eyes now
i was straining them and i saw-i

saw- 

  may i not live long enough to for-
get the love i glimpsed for an in-
stant in two reflected faces - a
womans and-a mans

  in the window my mothers face
was upturned and her hair was
dark as my cousin saris dark too
was the hair of the tall man who bent
to her and dark his eyes yet like two

stars-

  did i hear or think i heard that
one soft whisper   michael  

  i was trying to explain something
to myself  im seven but my father
left my mother with me a baby in her
arms there must be a me still that
is just a baby in her arms and

theyd want that baby-

  and then i realized that while i
thought about it the window picture

had changed-dimmed-faded-

  there was just the lamp blossoming
against blackness and my mothers
figure looking dim and somehow-
collapsed

  she had collapsed in her willow
chair she didnt move or speak to
me after a while i ran out into the
night crying for help

looking back from happy years of
personal fulfilment into that long
ago i know one thing that id
sacrifice everything that has come to
me rather than that one memory be-
cause that night when i was seven i
saw a lovers meeting-the meeting
of two who-lived what could life
matter if at the core it were rotten
with a futile emptiness to me life
is pregnant with meaning because i
have seen

  but from the scientific viewpoint
there is a word to add years after-
ward i was told that an autopsy had
been performed upon my mothers
body it was required by the terms
of miss weirs will ift order that j
might inherit the clause having been
included to prevent my mother from
contemplating suicide once my future
was assured i inherited and the
cause of my mothers death was de-
scribed by examining doctors as
unique in medical history

  my mothers heart had failed but
it was so atrophied that it appeared
as a muscle which has not been used
for many years

  i dont belong to the living  i
know that my heart is dead  if one
of us should die i know the other
could not live    the heart in my
bosom is not my own

  michael had willed his beloved wife
to guard the first years of their
childs earth-life and so she had re-
mained to guard them weakness ha
overcome him once and he had died
but in that other life there was no
more dying and no more weakness
he could command her and she
needed only his love and his com-
mand and it was done

  or in medical terms did will
work here an unparalleled marvel-
so that the circulation was maintained
in the veins by some unprecedented
nervous action without the function-
ing of the heart which became a mere
passive part of the circulatory sys-
tem this case will remain forever
unexplained
a brief tale of african jvitchcraft

the whistler

by august w derleth

major sir mark fortes-
cue stood for a moment on
the veranda staring into the
jungle blackness then he turned and
entered the bungalow the three men
in the living-room looked up at him
well said marsh

  everything quiet said fortes-
cue lighting his pipe too damned
quiet i dont like it   he tossed the
match toward a waste-basket

 nothing doing tonight then
asked marsh again

 i wish i knew old man the
major slumped into a chair there
are only four of us and ten of th
men that we can depend upon if it
comes to a battle-but it wont
marsh nodded the other two men
sat silently by

  i say said young kent suddenly
we can pick off the whole mob with
our machine-gun 

 major fortescue grunted if
they come close enough youve got
a lot to learn about warfare in this
country kent

 kent drew himself up proudly
youll pardon me major but i
havent got a trepanned skull for
nothing you know

  youll never have occasion to get
a trepanned skull here in the veldt
god said the fourth man i
wish theyd come at us

  we all do grayson

 it would be better than this
damned waiting-waiting nothing to
do but play bridge for a week now
and the news from home isnt due for
a month yet-almost two

    

  if said major fortescue curtly
we get it then

  those damned natives not one
of ems to be trusted

 kent turned suddenly what
about this man abou

  the major took his pipe from his
mouth and looked at him so youve
seen old abou eh if you value your
life kent youll not see him again
that old fellow why hes al-
most childish

  far from it snapped the major
isnt he a sort of chief asked
kent

  no said the major he isnt a
chief hes a witch doctor

  oh exclaimed kent and stared
ive heard about them

  i daresay you have said the
major i dont mind telling you
he continued that the fellow gray-
son replaced was picked up by abou
i dont care to talk about what hap-
pened to him

  marsh nodded  you  listen   he
said in a low voice or youll pay for
it

  but he seems so damned harm-
less

  thats just it said the major
dryly he does seem harmless
for a while the men sat silent then
kent spoke again

  im told he said that these
witch doctors have a great deal of in-
fluence over the natives  

  yes nodded the major

  why couldnt we buy abou off
  the major looked at him coldly
the whistler



was there anything that led yon to
believe i was joking about abou
kent shook his head

  then shut up and get any idea
of saving this place by buying off the
natives out of your head

  silence fell over the group after
a while the major looked at his wrist

  im going to bedhe said its
graysons watch until midnight then
ill be out

at midnight the major stood on
the veranda with grayson
theyre fighting us with weapons
we cant combat major fortescue
was saying you know what i mean
i dont believe in witchcraft but ive
seen some funny things here im
not so sure of myself after that  

  i know said grayson shortly
these out-of-the-way places have a
way about them in india once dur-
ing the sepoy rebellion i was sta-
tioned far to the north we got a
native dervish and threw him into the
guard-house in an hour he was dead
-no one knew how but there was not
a question about the matter our doc-
tor pronounced him dead as a six
weeks corpse we dragged him out
intending to bury him we laid him
on the ground turned our backs for
a moment and he was gone we sup-
posed his natives had made off with
the body next day he was walking
around again

  major fortescue nodded slowly
by the way he asked suddenly
who are kents nearest relatives
a brother i think an m p if
im not mistaken   grayson glanced
at him curiously

    that all  no wife-mother   
no both dead his wife died
just before he came here thats why
he came

  i see i wonder how we can best
notify the brother

  why what do you mean gray-
son stared at him

  the majors eyes were steely behind
his pince-nez because he said

evenly within twenty-four hours

after anyone meets abou that man
vanishes he will in all probability
never again be seen alive i daresay
youve heard of african animal mag-
netism-lamia sorcery

  grayson did not answer the major
shrugged his shoulders

  i do not dare to doubt that kent
has been under this influence ever
since his meeting with abou he must
return to abou-and god knows what
that hellish tribe will do to him 
grayson made a curious choking
sound in his throat

  i take it that youve been awake
every moment of the watch gray-
son

  grayson nodded

  and that you havent seen any-
thing-unusual

  grayson shook his head the major
took a revolver from about his waist

  well he said youd better go
and wake marsh kents not in the
house-bed hasnt been slept in
well have to go out there and look
for him

grayson vanished in the blackness
of the doorway and shortly after
the three men were pushing their way
silently through the jungle beyond the
bungalow

  stop whispered the major sud-
denly weve got to stay within
sight of the bungalow did you get
the men up he turned to marsh
yes they re on guard major
we cant stand here all night
major grayson protested

  i know it snapped fortescue
then listen im going to call
kent he shouted and again
kent

  the three men stood in silence
presently as if from a distance came
an echo

  there they are said the major
grimly   there is never an echo
here listen

  in the darkness rang another cry
help major help major


weird tales

 my god said grayson under

his breath

  quiet warned the major

  again the cry came closer this
time then for a long time there was
silence all of the men were shift-
ing around when it came at first a
low vague sound as of someone whis-
tling far away then it changed
abruptly and sounded immediately
before them

  grayson gripped the majors arm
thats kent its drdlas souvenir
hes whistling kent always whistles
that

  the major nodded i recognized
it at once he said

  the whistling came again louder
this time

  get your revolvers ready when
i give the word fire  

 but kent- said grayson

  you follow my orders snapped
the major

  again came the whistling-now be-
hind them now before then far
away the cry help major fol-
lowed by a long-drawn-out ah
then the whistle again just before
them

  fire said the major harshly

  three shots rang out as one there
was a momentary silence then some-
thing came crashing through the trees
toward them a round something
bounded out of the brush and against
the majors foot fortescue turned
his flash on it but turned it off at
once he reached down picked it up
and put it under his jacket

  lights ordered the major
three lights flashed into the jun-
gle just ahead of them lay an old
native clothed in a single bizarre
strip of cloth about the loins- around
his neck hung many beads some of
bone his face was streaked with
paint

  abou said the major in a stifled
voice examine him

  the two men stepped forward
got it in the abdomen said
marsh he wont last

  no said the major stepping for-
ward he wont very deliberate-
ly he placed the barrel of his revolver
against the negros temple and pulled
the trigger the lights went out

 we may expect relief of some
kind said the major on the way to
the bungalow the natives will
most likely be gone by morning or
they may attack at once now that
abou is dead either way it is bet-
ter

in the house grayson turned to the

major what was it you picked
up major

  without a word the major placed
the object upon the table it was a
human skull totally devoid of all
flesh slightly toward the back of the
head was a triangular silver plate
grayson whirled the majors face
was grim his eyes were mere pin-
points

    my god   said grayson in a chok-
ing voice  who was it-out theret
i have very little hope that you
will understand still lees be-
lieve this incredible adventure
that poor jerry and i went through
only a year ago but if i write it
all down perhaps the memory that
haunts me sleeping or waking will
fade from my tortured mind they
think here that i am mad and i am
afraid that i really shall go mad
soon if no one will believe this true
and frightful story

  jerry nicholls and i were at daw-
lifch university together as close pals
as two young enthusiasts could be
and shared everything from our
views on evolution to a teapot with
a broken spout

  it was in our third year that
jerrys grandfather died and being

the last of the nicholls and the sole
heir to the old mans property of
course jerry -was bound to appear at
the funeral

  i	heard nothing from him until two
weeks later when this letter arrived
on the last day of term

  for the lords sake frank come down to
this beastly hole i oant start with you
immediately for switzerland according to
plan because of all the business connected
with this rotten old estate come at once
a few more nights alone in this howling
wilderness will turn me gray

                                  jerry

  that was enough for me i stuffed
a wet sponge and a few more pairs
of socks into an already bursting
suitcase tied an extra bit of string

                                   


weird tales

round it and caught the next train
going north

  jerry was waiting at doone sta-
tion and his face lit up with a grin
of delight as he gripped my hand
we walked home across the marsh-
land and poor jerry fairly babbled
all the way he had been so lonely
that he couldnt talk fast enough

  doone house was the center and
soul of a gray solitary world built
of the dark ironstone peculiar to
that dreary district it stood at one
entrance to a long narrow ravine
known as blackstone cut whose
frowning rocky walls opened out at
the farther end on a limitless waste
of moor and bog

  the first time i saw it blackstone
cut looked to me like a road to hell
it looked like a road to hell and so
it was    for jerry and i trod that
road and jerry still   

  i cant tell this story as i should
the horror of it is too vivid the hell
of which i speak too near for me to
write calmly and clearly but try
try to believe me



ouve noticed it too jerry

  	said a few days later nasty
atmosphere in this house isnt
there he hesitated then went on
abruptly im not proud of my pro-
genitors and grandfather-well
dead or not he was as near a devil
as any human being could be and
still be human

  i laughed with some embarrass-
ment and murmured something about
the old man being gone now

  jerry got up from the luncheon
table and stared moodily hands in
his pockets at the driving rain
against the window-panes grand-
father may be gone but hes not
gone far

  what on earth- i began

  no not on earth-in hell jerry
replied hes waiting there for his
dutiful grandson to join him it
would spoil his pleasure completely

to know that i had escaped him in
the end

  i stared dumfounded at this out-
burst from jerry the suppressed
bitterness of years was in his voice
and his face was a mask of hate he
came back to the table and sat heav-
ily down in his chair again his dark
eyes smoldering

  you dont know-you cant un-
derstand what it has been all these
years on the one hand dawlish
on the other hand grandfather the
long fight to hold out against him
the knowledge deep down within me
that some day sooner or later he
would win

  win i echoed feebly

  win yes win out against the col-
lege and all that it stood for to me
he was forced to send me to daw-
lish my fathers will provided for
that but he meant to win in the
end  

  your grandfather wanted you to

be-to be-er-

  to be the sort of beast he him-
self was finished jerry thats
exactly what he wanted i was des-
tined to carry on his experiments
you see

  i didnt see in the least and wait-
ed dumbly for jerry to explain how-
ever he jumped up suddenly his
face lit with his old familiar grin

  come on frank ive got the
blues today and youll be pushing
off on the next train if im not care-
ful ive got something to show you-
-come on

  he hooked his arm in mine affec-
tionately and steered me up dismal
stairways and along endless corri-
dors whose closed doors made me
shiver i felt that each door opened
as we passed and that leering faces
peeped after us

  jerry caught me looking back and
tightened his grip on my arm

  horrid sensation isnt it thats
an old trick of my grandfathers he
used to punish me when i was a
youngster by making me walk up
the footprint



and down these corridors at dusk
theres no one there really im
used to it the performance is for
your benefit now

  my benefit i gasped look
here jerry whats come over you
what kind of tricks do you mean
what kind of tricks oh hypno-
tism partly and partly-something
else said jerry i tell you he was
a devil-a devil and hes still here
trying to get me

  hes dead jerry i protested
if you get to imagining things like
this youll be in a strait jacket before
you know it hes dead and gone
now

  hes not gone far repeated
jerry obstinately

  youre talking absolute rot i
answered hotly the sooner you
get out of this damned hole the bet-
ter what do you suppose the fel-
lows would say if they knew you be-
lieved such bunkum

  it may be rot he said slowly
i try to persuade myself that i
think so too

  of course it is i assured him
heartily wait till youre climbing
the alps next month youll laugh
at all these nightmares

  his face cleared still more two
weeks more and we shall be in
switzerland i shall have escaped
once and for all from this old dun-
geon and-him his voice sank in-
voluntarily and he glanced round as
if he expected to see a visible chal-
lenge to his words

  free he repeated in a defiant
voice and only the moan of the wind
and the dripping rain answered him



nprns is what i wanted to show
a you jerrys voice was eager
as he opened a door at the top of the
house and led the way into a huge
dim room under the roof where
great rafters stretched overhead
and a shining wood floor mirrored
them in its polished surface

  the vails from ceiling to floor
were lined with books

  my word jerry i said in an
awed voice what a stunning li-
brary   

  thought youd appreciate it he
said enjoying my surprize the
nicholls were famous for their love
of learning among other less pleas-
ing vices this little lot has taken
some hundreds of years to collect

  for some time i browsed among
the shelves bewildered at the im-
mense choice they offered jerry left
me to my own devices and it was
some hours later when i looked up
to see him in a distant corner of the
vast attic room

  whats your latest fairy-tale
i called out as i went over to him

  poor old jerry i can see him now
as he looked up at me his eyes blaz-
ing with excitement and interest he
was dangerously enthusiastic and
liable to get right off his track when
anything gripped him really hard

  ive never noticed this book be-
fore and his voice was queer and
husky its not even catalogued
but here it is cheek by jowl with
good old fabre he laughed on a
high excited note bit of a con-
trast-what

  i took the book from him if i had
known-oh if i had only guessed
what that harmless-looking book was
going to mean to jerry and me id
have cut off my hand before touch-
ing it instinct indeed why our
instincts simply lay down and went
to sleep whil jerry and i gamboled
light-heartedly across the threshold
to hell

  the book was written by a certain
count von gheist and at first it ap-
peared to be a sort of skit on vari-
ous dreamers and mystics of past
centuries

  that was the trap-the cynical
baffling style in which von gheist ap-
proached his subject jerry and i
sat side by side in one of the deep
window-seats and chuckled delight-


weird tales

edly over the early chapters-the
gay malicious way in which the au-
thor exposed the ignorance of fa-
mous charlatans of old

  subtly and imperceptibly by cun-
ning devious routes von gheist
merged his style from the cynical to
one of deadly earnestness which
finally gripped me as strongly as it
had jerry

  the book is burned to ashes now
i did that after jerry-after
jerry- no that comes later

  what a blind ignorant fool i was
for him with his grim childhood in
that cursed house there was a rea-
son and excuse for weakness for
me there was no such excuse i might
have warned and guarded him from
that seeking devil that reached up
put of hell

  jerry jerry  where are you now



it was jerry who first put our
thoughts into words as we sat one
evening before the red glow of a log
fire after a prolonged discussion of
von gheists theories

  its a full moon on friday you
know

  i nodded the same idea had been
in my mind all day

 it would be rather a joke
wouldnt it he went on trying
hard to camouflage his real earnest-
ness

  again i nodded the same consum-
ing desire burnt in my breast as in
his to try it out to prove von
gheists words-to test that final
superb claim of his

  in cold blood reading this you
will say we were fools and worse
than fools but you have never lived
at doone house never heard the
voices that whisper and call when
night falls on blackstone cut never
seen the faces in the dim corridors
that vanish at a look or cry

  above all you have never imag-
ined a creature as vile as jerrys
grandfather or been caught in the

mesh of his deviltries and here i
warn you as you value your im-
mortal soul never to enter doone
house for you can not hope to es-
cape him there

  he is dead and gone-but he is not
gone far jerry was right horribly
right when he said that

  after all there is no reason why
such experiments should be out of
reach jerry continued we can
project sight and sound to vast dis-
tances and these are purely human
and physical attributes why not the
intelligence which directs our bodies
if we could direct our minds as von
gheist did his we could give a tre-
mendous jolt to science

  it appears to be chiefly a matter
of concentration

  yes replied jerry that more
or less spectacular ceremony he men-
tions is merely a means von gheist
suggests to fix the will-power

  i dont quite see- i began

  of course not interrupted
jerry thats why we ought to ex-
periment von gheist says plainly
that his experiences may only serve
to baffle other experimenters re-
action varies according to the intelli-
gence and will fear he says is the
one great deterrent

  my mind went off suddenly at a
tangent what kind of experiments
did your grandfather make i
asked

  jerry frowned and kicked a log
into flame why he believed in all
the people that von gheist ridicules
-paracelsus lully count raymond
dr dee and all the rest his experi-
ments were all along their lines more

or less i think-

 well go on what do you
think

  i think he really did achieve un-
holy power by some means or other
but since reading this book i dont
feel quite the same about grand-
father as i did he seems farther
away now its like a weight slipping
from my neck
the footprint



  as he spoke my glance eauglit a
very strange effect of light and
shadow cast by the dancing flames
of the log fire-a tall wavering out-
line beside jerrys chair which
swayed in a horrible semblance of
mirth while the rain and wind hissed
savagely in the old chimney

  the dog saw something there too
for he got to his feet growling his
teeth bared as he stared at that mov-
ing shadow

  quiet said jerry lightly cuff-
ing the animals head there arent
any rats here old fellow then
catching sight of my face why
whats wrong frank youre abso-
lutely green

  i blinked my eyes feeling remark-
ably foolish as a great log broke and
roared in an upward stream of flame
and sparks and the shadow i had
seen vanished in the clear red light
which bathed the hearth inwardly
i cursed myself for an imaginative
fool and told jerry i had a rather
bad twinge of neuralgia

 no wonder in this damp old
tomb of a house he said poor old
chap this is no picnic for you
oh dont rot i answered
gruffly my nerves still jumping from
the effect of that momentary terror
i had experienced

we spent the next few days like
two kids in expectation of
christmas looking back now i see
so clearly the warnings given me
that we were on a dangerous road
but at the time i purposely ignored
them for i was dull and bored at
doone house and our coming ex-
periment prondsed relief from the
monotony of the long wet days and
quiet nights

  friday night came at last a high
wind drove off the rain-clouds and
a full moon lit blackstone cut from
end to end as we climbed up the
stairs to the library shut out the ter-
rier locked all the doors and pre-

pared to follow the directions given
by von gheist

  jerry won the toss and was there-
fore first to make the experiment

  i sat in a window-bay to watch in
the stillness of the great library
every sound was exaggerated and
the howl of the wind and the whin-
ing of the dog outside the locked
door got on my nerves at first then
jerrys preparations absorbed all my
attention

  i laughed inwardly at his child-
like absorption in drawing the cir-
cles and figures on the wood floor
referring with frowning intentness to
von gheists diagrams but neverthe-
less i was impressed when all was
ready and jerry stood erect and tri-
umphant in the midst of his braziers
and touched the alderwood in each
to flame with the burning torch in
his hand

  all this mummery i reflected was
childish in itself but taken as a
means to absorb and concentrate the
faculties it certainly worked well

 jerry was as completely with-
drawn from his physical surround-
ings as a buddhist who has attained
nirvana i heard his low muttering
voice repeat the words

  phlagus taram zoth

  founts of all knowledge will and power

  by the wandering bull and the  four
     horns of the altar

  pierce the veil of my darkness   

  the wind dropped outside and a
queer heat began to invade the room
my skin felt dry as parchment and
when i saw jerry raise a great gob-
let to his lips and drink deep my
own thirst tortured me

  then i forgot everything as fear
gripped me for the things that were
happening in that brazier-lit circle
were not things of which von gheist
had written in his book

 hell and heaven were to him
merely fabrications of primitive
man ghosts and devils he derided
as the sick fancies of the unintelli-
gent 


weird tales

  what then was it that jerry saw
as he stood with face convulsed with
terror and blazing eyes fixed on
something within the circle-some-
thing from which he retreated step
by step to the very edge of the fiery
barrier he had made and halted
there like a man with his back to a
wall

  no no no i heard his low
agonized voice not that grand-
father-not that

  panic seized me as i watched the
despairing fear and loathing on
jerrys face what in the name of
all that was evil did he see al-
though i did not know what i feared
insensate terror shook the heart out
of me and left me as helpless to move
or speak as if i were paralyzed

 i tried to call out my brain
shrieked the words jerry jerry
hold on hold on im coming
jerry but my cold shaking lips
refused to utter a syllable

  dumb and powerless i watched as
he tried to beat off his enemy and
escape from the maze of circles and
pentacles he had drawn about him-
self the net his own hands had
made

  within the glow of his fiery bar-
rier i saw his desperate eyes-his
face wet with hideous effort as he
ran doubling here and there across
his narrow prison gasping fighting
struggling blindly with the deadly
thing which pursued

  his eyes met mine and from his
twisted mouth came a hoarse des-
perate appeal break it break the
circle

  something burst in my brain i
lurched forward and fell right across
the outer circle of his prison knock-
ing over two braziers and smearing
the diagrams in blind clumsy haste

  the fires leaped up into sudden
flame with a sound like crackling
laughter then died out completely
and jerry and i found ourselves in a
dark silent room our hands holding
one another fast



next morning after pacing rest-
lessly up and down the long
avenue to doone house jerry came
to sit beside me on a low crumbling
wall

  you dont understand even now
frank he said i cant escape be-
cause i have brought this on myself
it was all a trap-and i chose to en-
ter the trap of my own free will
thats what puts me within his
grasp i called him back to me i
opened the gate between the dead
and the living with my own hands
last night

  i rubbed my red hair fretfully and
scowled

  i dont believe it youre letting
the past hypnotize you youll soon
forget all this when you get away
from this cursed place

  can you forget he asked in a
low strange voice his dark eyes
burning into mine

  i hesitated for a moment and he
took me up with passionate earnest-
ness

 you dont-you cant forget
you never will forget its no use
frank old chap im done

  rot-absolute rot you priceless
fool i dont pretend to understand
our experience last night but im
sure we worked ourselves up un-
necessarily there are some experi-
ments one is wiser not to make and
apparently ours was one of them
experiment echoed jerry
you realize dont you who von
gheist was-and why he wrote that
book

  hes a most convincing rascal at
all events i said and fooled us
pretty thoroughly

  my grandfather wrote that book
he left it as a last weapon for me to
turn on myself

von gheist-your grandfather
of course jerry replied star-
ing out over the desolate wind-swept
the footprint



garden   that book was a trick after

his own heart

  i dont know what yon mean i
said feeling surly and baffled by my
own new thoughts and fears but
youll go right off the deep end if
youre not jolly careful come away
with me today and let that damned
old lawyer whistle for you

  i cant his voice was low and
sullen

 meaning-

  im not allowed he continued
im not sure yet-if theres a way
out for me-im trying to discover

  well for heavens sake lets do
something not mope about the place
like a couple of wet owls

  yon wont understand i know
he answered reluctantly but i
think-i feel pretty certain that i
cant pass the gates

  i stared at him then broke out im-
patiently

  whats to prevent you walking
out of your own gates for the
lords sake jerry are you quite off
your head im not going to stay if
you dont buck up there is a limit
you know

  he looked as though i had struck
him

 not stay with me he came
close and stared wildly into my face
im going mad dyou hear mad
with fear you cant go i wont be
left alone   tears softened the wild
glare of his eyes and i stood like the
embarrassed fool that i was pretend-
ing not to notice his emotion

 oh all right i managed to
blurt out at last dont lose your
wool about it ill stay but its
pretty thick if youre going to moon
round like this all the time

  i know-oh i know what a putrid
time you re having ill make it up
to you later-in switzerland if i can
get there he added in an under-
tone

 then he took my arm with a
strange air of resolution saying
after all now or later it will be

all the same in the end well go over
to hightown

  how little i guessed of the horror
he was facing or of the ghastly effort
it needed for him to leave that house
and garden i saw that he went
white to the lips as we passed
through the gates at the end of the
long avenue but i pretended not to
notice his frequent glances over his
shoulder

  he walked closer and closer to me
making no response to anything i
said edging me all the time against
the wall on my other side at last i
offered to change places with him

  you try the wall i laughed
its a good hard one

  then i glanced at the muddy road
and stood staring in bewilderment
jerry saw it at the same moment
and with a choking ciy he lurched
up against the wall

  for long we stared in fascinated
horror at the colossal footprint there
before us i was shaken and puzzled
but jerrys fear was something be-
yond all words

  hes winning    winning you
see it now his voice rose to a wild
note of hysteria if i dont go back
hell torment me for hours its no
use    no use 

  he began slowly to drag himself
back along the road while i pro-
tested and argued hotly until i
turned to see that the impress of that
infernal foot followed us back to the
very gateway of doone house

  my heart stood still as we walked
up the gloomy avenue to see those
awful footprints following-follow-
ing to the hateful threshold of the
house itself and over the threshold
they followed on i saw how the dust
of the neglected corridors rose and
swirled in little eddies behind poor
jerry as that vast evil swept on in
his wake

  he made for the library-that dim
gorgeous antechamber to hell-and
there strangely enough whatever it
was that haunted jerry withdrew


weird tales

for a long time the horror slid from
his soul leaving him cheerful and
sanguine once more possibly certain
hours were more favorable for the
things manifestation than others
but jerry put aside his fears and
even made light of the visible signs
of his grandfathers power we had
both witnessed so recently

  its another of his tricks i hope
hes exhausted himself this time
there is a limit to what he can do
ill come away with you tomorrow
and not give him another chance to
get mel

we went late to bed and i was
just dropping off to sleep when
i heard jerrys cry without stop-
ping even for shoes i dashed off
along the corridor to his room as i
reached his door he burst out with
mad terror on his face and ran past
me like the wind

  i felt a suffocating sense of heat
and staggered back as from an open
furnace door then with no courage
at all but simply a blind instinct to
follow i went after jerry

  as i ran i saw that the carpet
under my feet was scorched and
blackened and that the marks were
identical in shape and size with those
we had seen in the muddy road
earlier that day

  on raced jerry a mad flying fig-
ure ahead dowh the big central
staircase he went across the tiled
hall and i heard the groan of bolts
and bars as he tore open the great
double-doors and fled out into the
night

  and as i followed i felt the burn-
ing heat under my bare feet-smelled
the odor of charred wood as i stum-
bled over the threshold and vaguely
wondered if the house were on fire

  outside in the dark night i saw
jerry running as though pursued by
all the fiends of hell and so he was
   so he was i know that now
but then i did not understand and
i ran after him panting and cursing

because he would not stop or listen
to my assurance that he was running
from his own fears and nothing else

  on and on through the darkness
raced jerry on and on i stumbled
behind him-farther and farther be-
hind as the road grew rougher and
steeper

  he headed for blackstone cut and
rushed on between its somber walls
keeping up an incredible speed until
he approached the head of the ra-
vine where its rocky walls rose to
great frowning crags-two grim
guardians at the portals of hell

  to my amazement jerry began to
climb the rocky face of one of the
crags his speed and sureness of
foot were nothing short of miracu-
lous and only the madness of over-
mastering fear could have lent him
wings to take that terrible way

  he looked like some crazy little
insect crawling over the bare face of
the rock blindly seeking safety
where none was to be found clinging
-leaping-running-scrambling on
hands and knees until he stood at
last on the topmost height a tiny
frenzied figure against the sky

 but whatever pursued him had
pursued him even to his giddy eyrie
for i was near enough to see his wild
gestures-his frantic repulsion of
something at his side

  oh jerry if i had only overtaken
you-if i had not left you to fight
that last awful fight up there alone
-alone with him-it would be
easier for me to think of you now

  but you were alone-most awfully
alone-and so you lost jerry had
i been there perhaps you woidd have
won-perhaps you would have won
that thoiight is driving mo mad-per-
haps you would have won

 a high thin scream of agony
floated down to me from the heights
i saw jerry leap out into the dark-
ness and fall turning and twisting
with outflung limbs to the floor of
the ravine
the footprint



his body was never found the
whole of doone village turned
out to hunt for him but he was
never found and they said he had
fallen into a bog and been swallowed
up in the black ooze

  but i know better for i found
and followed the trail of those colos-
sal footprints and they led to a
grassy hollow under the crag from
which jerry had flung himself down
the green of the hollow was charred
and burned to the black earth itself
and there was no trace of jerry-no
trace of flesh or bone

  but there was something else
which i recognized with terror on
the flat surface of a piece of granite

lying in the hollow was a peculiar
and significant mark roughly cut in
the stone it was the mark of von
gheist-the key to von gheist great
experiment with which poor jerry
had unlocked the door between the
dead and the living

  the villagers of doone shook their
heads over me pityingly when i
showed them the mark they saw
nothing in it save the furrows
caused by the fret of time and
weather

  but i recognized it and i remem-
bered i am going mad with remem-
bering    and no one will believe
me

  jerrys grandfather had won

recapture

by h p lovecraft

the way led down a dark half-wooded heath
where moss-gray boulders humped above the mold

and curious drops disquieting and cold

sprayed up from unseen streams in gulfs beneath

there was no wind or any trace of sound
in puzzling shrub or alien-featured tree

nor any view before-till suddenly

straight in my path i saw a monstrous mound

half to the sky those steep sides loomed upspread
rank-grassed and cluttered by a crumbling flight
of lava stairs that scaled the fear-topped height
in steps too vast for any human tread

i shrieked-and knew what primal star and year

had sucked me back from mans dream-transient sphere
-a story of a revivified corpse

seven drops
of blood

     by h f jamison

the scourge of death-the
parting of loved ones forever
-has been the one great sor-
row of the ages saint and sinner
alike have shared its devastating
power men of science have sought to
conquer the destroyer but have hope-
lessly failed superstition in an ar-
ray of mystic rites and ceremonies
which included the slaying of goats
and bullocks the beating of tom-toms
in weird devil-dances the laying on
of hands and the sprinkling of holy-
water has promised immunity from
death human puppets have crossed
continents and seas braving every
known peril of the wilderness and
jungle in search of the fabled foun-
tain of youth in which they might
bathe and be young again but at last
that insatiable monster-the rider of
the pale horse-has stretched forth
his talons of bone and has dragged
them down-down-into his endless
embrace

  life is but a vapor a few days here
and a man is gone and in multitudi-
nous cases even his memory after a
moment of time compared to eternity
is obliterated entirely

  whence came man why was he
created what is his purpose why
such a short and feeble existence  is
life wrorth the misery entailed upon
him why a somewhere beyond
this vale of tears why not a per-
petual existence here  why look for-
ward after his passing to a chimerical
and doubtful resurrection of the
dead

    

  these and many similar thoughts
surged through the brain of stanton
j eldon millionaire dreamer and
master of weird experiments as he sat
alone in his private laboratory

  somewhere in this world-he be-
lieved it with all his being-there
was a force mighty enough to scoff at
death and the grave if one could only
find it was that force in chemistry
was it electro-magnetic what
where

  why should man let the motor of
the body-the human heart-stop at
all and in the event that it did
stop why not start it again

  he wondered if the experiment of
the great scientists of which he had
just been reading-where vitality had
been momentarily re-established in
the human body after death had been
in undisputed possession of it for
twenty-nine hours-was really a suc-
cess was it a forecast of greater
things to come or was it merely a
case of the use of a high-pressure
drug so potent that even lifeless clay
could not withstand the terrific on-
slaught for example an effect simi-
lar to that produced upon the muscles
of a frog when salt is placed upon
them he did not know

  from another standpoint he rea-
soned if the believers in what he
termed superstition-the so-called
bible myths-were correct even they
had not taken advantage of their al-
leged unlimited possibilities for had
not jesus broken the bonds of death
and declared he that believeth in
seven drops of blood



me shall never die and death
shall have no more dominion over
you

  what was the secret of the naza-
renes power the fools after see-
ing his actual demonstration-a re-
turn from the tomb-they mocked
him and didnt even attempt to learn
the truth so for that reason he let
them   go their way  

  but after a careful reading and re-
reading of their traditions eldon saw
beneath the surface a startling ray of
light-through lightning and ser-
pents venom and blood

  i saw satan as lightning fall
from heaven the sacred writer de-
clares satan is still here eldon rea-
soned  invisible all-powerful-still
here all adherents to the sacred
scriptures freely admit this regard-
less of their respective creeds they
acknowledge that his satanic maj-
esty is the one great foe of humanity
for he is supposed to control death-
infernal nemesis of mankind

  again satan is the original ser-
pent of edens garden and the crea-
tor had said that the seed of the wo-
man should bruise the serpents head
therefore any man who could con-
quer death even momentarily would
fulfil that prophecy satan being
lightning personified and virgin
blood being a cleanser from the
adamic sin why not make use of one
of the fallen archangels own weap-
ons-fight fire with fire so to speak-
and bring about a perpetual existence
here

seven-mystic number the golden
candlesticks were seven upon the
altar there were seven lean and seven
plenteous years of king pharaohs
reign the seven-word vow of eternal
celibacy must be chanted by a novi-
tiate of twice seven years with one
hand upon a crucifix the other up-
raised toward the seven stars the
seven drops of blood must be taken
from the virgins side-electrify those
precious drops of consecrated blood

with a voltage the middle number of
which must be seven-god he saw it
all as clearly as he could see the sun
at noonday 

  news item-artificial lightning has
just been produced anywhere from

	to one million volts

  eldon smiled in a pitying way as
he mused they are making a great
to-do over their new discovery that
is a year-old successful experiment
writh me else i would not now attempt
this demonstration

the morgue-cold cruel repository
of silent forms

 how long has this man been
dead eldon inquired indicating a
glass-topped refrigerating-case

  about thirty hours sir the
keeper answered unidentified too
as you see by the blue tag guess
the county will have him to bury
looks like suicide to me  

not embalmed yet of course or
he wouldnt be under refrigeration
no nobody in sight to pay the
bill if the county gets him hell go
in cold the keeper replied grimly

  eldon leaned over and placed a bill
in the others hand lay off the em-
balming and send the body to my lab-
oratory ill fix it with mr rothc
yes sir coming up sir the
keeper already knew the color of el-
dons money it was always yellow

once more stanton j eldon was in
his element he was nearly ready
for the greatest experiment of his ca-
reer

  the body of the unknown had been
electrically heated to  degrees the
seven drops of virgin blood had been
injected together with the venom of
the species of serpent by which the
israelites were bitten and later healed
by the serpent of brass upon the pole
and the scientist stood with his hand
upon a controlling rheostat from
which led four high-tension wrires one
of them to an ankle of the corpse an-
other to the top of his head and the


weird tales

others directly into a dynamic aerial-
fluid generator capable of producing
artificial lightning up to one million
volts

  a greenish-blue light enshrouded
the silent subject now if eldons
preposterous formula to offset the ter-
rible voltage-yet to be applied-was
correct all would be well if not an
electrical cremation would result in-
stead of a prospective resurrection

  gruesome  stanton j eldon knew
no such word why should the dead
body of a man excite any emotions
different from those which might be
occasioned by the sight of a fowl slain
for dinner it was all in the state of
mind ghosts spooks and hobgoblins
held no terrors for him he had
never known of the presence of an
ogre at the advent of a human being
into this world why should there be
any at ones exit the fear of death
he said to himself has been fostered
by religious fanatics since the dawn
of creation and civilization has paid
dearly for it-is still paying

  one of eldons friends had told
him that if there was any such thing
as spirit return if eldon would go
and sit on his friends grave at mid-
night on the day following his demise
he would make himself manifest if
possible the instructions had been
carried out not only once but for
seven successive nights and nothing
had happened so eldon had smoked
his black cigars in vain

  if there was anything on the other
side he wanted first-hand informa-
tion concerning it in his heart of
hearts he might consider the possibil-
ity of another life but scoffed at the
idea of a spirits return from that
life to this mundane sphere secret-
ly he may have been like the old
negro hambone who said no sah
i dont bleeb in ghosts but i dont
want no truck wid em

eldon turned the knob of the rheo-
stat slowly almost imperceptibly
and familiar though he was with

nearly every sort of crazy experiment
he gave a little gnmt of approval as
the body before him moved slightly
according to his imagined schedule
when the voltmeter showed the

	marie
was there any merit to words of in-
cantation well - they were sup-
posed to be the very foundation of all
hocus-pocus exorcism magic and
mystery so they must form a part of
his own con jury in this case

  peace be still the supreme
magician of the universe had com-
manded and the winds and the waves
had obeyed he could have calmed
them just as easily with never a word

  in the name of jesus christ of
nazareth rise up and walk said
his apostle and a cripple lame from
his mothers womb arose and began
leaping and praising

  furthermore the supreme magi-
cian had promised if ye believe
greater things than these ye shall do
well - eldon never doubted the
masters ability to do those things
but he was just a little skeptical re-
garding his own personal powers
however he wouldnt dispute the
masters word so his fingers clutched
the rheostat knob a little tighter and
he intoned a sacred formula from the
old testament whieh he had selected
as best suited for the occasion   thou
of the valley of dry bones rise up
and salute 

  a long pause once more he chant-
ed as i passed by thee  i
said while thou wast in thy blood
yea i said while thou wast in thy
blood live

  the clammy thing upon the table
slowly opened its eyes its tongue
moistened its lips a smacking sound
followed and it spoke in ghastly un-
natural tones such as might have come
forth from the tomb itself

  gladys youre all ive ever cared
for and now to think that you would
betray me-would be unfaithful   
see this gun ive always said that
no wife of mine could ever betray me
seven drops of blood



and get away with it no i wont let
go of your arm i don t give a damn
if i do break it for im going to send
your cheating soul to hell anyway
oh my god gladys-i didnt
intend to do that gladys gladys
speak to me

  the frightful guttural cry which
came from the living-dead franken-
stein-monster before eldon was music
to his scientific ears for he had
bruised the serpents head he had
conquered death

  the horrid spokesman upon the
table continued why hello jim
yes i shot her and then killed my-
self    what a beautiful grove of
trees  and over there is the river
of life and the sea of glass   
where is that music coming from
   gee im thirsty that was cer-
tainly a glorious drink is ones
slightest wish gratified here i wish
i could see gladys    why there
she is now how radiantly beautiful
she appears    but she deceived
me jim i wish i knew the truth
   oh jim i do know the truth
gladys is coming toward me i wor-
ship her jim then i saw through a
glass darkly but now i see face to
face    shes gone    she was
tempted  i understand    the
master forgave her as he forgave the
woman they would have stoned   
and now-look look those two are
together see they embrace    the
magdalene came to meet gladys to tell
her she need have no fears  gladys
will be transformed too made pure
and holy    and i will join gladys
after i go through a slight purgatorial
fire    jim jim tell me more
   quick jim-ive started back
to earth and i dont want to go the
world is such a hell nothing there
but misery and wo    heaven much
better than even this    this only
paradise you say    oh jim im
going back    yes yes-i see who
is doing it i know many things now
death which i dreaded so much i
find to be but the open door to com-

plete happiness  yes yes ill
make that scientist-

the hideous form half arose from
the table and turning looked
straight at eldon with a gaze so all-
seeing in those dead yet living orbs
that for a moment the scientist ceased
chewing his black cigar

  you fool the words burned
the very air you miserable con-
temptible experimenting fool inter-
fering with the plans of the gods
why i wouldnt be back on your ac-
cursed planet if you were to deed me
the worthless thing if a murderer
even as i has a chance over yonder
what will it mean to one who has
always played square    open that
switch

  eldon shifted the cigar to the other
side of his mouth and chewed vig-
orously upon it for several seconds
then he spoke

  not so fast brother its been
some time since ive conversed with
anybody with one foot over the bor-
derline so to speak and as this will
doubtless be my last opportunity to
do so i would like to ask a few ques-
tions the first one is is your cor-
poreal body suffering any pain 
the torture is intolerable the
other cried vehemently

  one truth eldon ejaculated
there has been some doubt as to
whether restored dead fiesli has any
feeling that point is settled now i
want to slip just a little more current
to you perhaps i can be able to give
you the eternal life possessed by the
fallen archangel hows that he
shot the needle around to the 
mark

  the monster was jerked violently
backward a distance of eighteen
inches then sat bolt upright a mo-
ment in that position and one foot
was lifted outward and downward to
the floor the other followed and the
indescribable cadaver arose from the
table and with short jerky steps-its
progress impeded by the heavy copper


weird tales

electrodes and the large insulated
wires-it started toward eldon point-
ing a curved rigid finger into his
face the scientist backed away one
touch from the tips of those fingers
of destruction and he would be in
possession of full information regard-
ing the other shore

  an ear-blighting shriek came from
the lips of the walking remains

  you fiend you damnable hellion
look at my hands-the flesh is be-
ginning to roast you arc destroying
my body and soul my body will be
consumed to ashes and my soul con-
signed to oblivion open that switch   

 eldon saw-heard-and smelled
the diabolical scene of his own mak-
ing  saw the flesh beginning to shrivel
like cracklings heard the blood
seething his nostrils weie filled with
the nauseating odor and he knew that
the virgin blood was being overcome
by the terrible voltage-an improper
mixture somewhere he couldnt
reach the rheostat for the death-
dealing fingers before him so he ran
to the master switch and kicked it
open

  the burning carcass wavered back
and forth then laughed-a hideous
vultural croak which came from melt-
ing vocal chords

  has-iss-heiss-awk great news
for you-eldon the spark of life
still talked though going fast
youll join me-may st--
ten a m-auto wreck-awk-liiss-

hiss   the imcanny volcanic manikin
slumped down sack-like    eldon
wiped the cold sweat from his brow

two hours later he entered the
morgue heard anything yet
about our unknown he inquired

  yes i was just going to phone
you we have learned his name hes
a guy from up slayton way killed
himself after croakin his wife i
think they said her name was gladys
they were found out on a country
road by the side of an old ford car

   why whats the matter-you
sick

  eldon had swallowed his cigar stub
at the sudden confirmatory words of
his experiment

  no need to embalm the body when
i return it he said his voice was
weak and he was very pale it has
been electrically embalmed you may
charge them for the job however if
they wrant embalming done and keep
the money  

  the keeper rubbed his chin in a
thoughtful way embalmed by elec-
tricity thats a new one must be
your latest eh

  eldon walked slowly toward the
front yes he replied and i
think it will be my last

  when he reached the door he turned
and called back say by the way
do you wrant to buy a good automo-

weird tales

hole in the curtain and then al-
though all the people he had expected
had not arrived he felt it would not
do for him to wait any longer the
audience was composed of well-bred
and courteous men and women but
despite their polite self-restraint lor-
ing could sec that some of them were
getting tired of waiting so very re-
luctantly and feeling that further
delay was impossible he raised the
curtain and came forward on the
stage

  briefly he announced that the ex-
hibition would open with some fire-
works he had brought from korea it
was plain to sec that the statement
that fireworks were about to be set off
on a theater stage by an amateur had
rather startled some of the audience
and loring hastened to explain that
these were not real fireworks but that
they were contrivances made of
colored glass which were illuminated
by the powerful lens of a lantern
which was placed out of sight and
while the  apparent pyrotechnic dis-
play would resemble fireworks of
strange and grotesque designs it
would be absolutely without danger
he brought out some little bundles of
bits of colored glass hung them at
some distance apart on a wire which
was stretched across the stage just
high enough for him to reach it and
then lighted his lantern which he
placed in one of the wings loavered all
the lights in the theater and began
his exhibition

  as loring turned his lantern on one
of the clusters of glass lenses strips
and points and unseen himself
caused them to move by means of long
cords attached the effects were beau-
tiful and marvelous little wheels of
colored fire rapidly revolved minia-
ture rockets appeared to rise a few
feet and to explode in the air and
while all the ordinary forms of fire-
works were produced on a diminutive
scale there were some effeets that
were entirely novel to the audience
as the light was turned successively

upon one and another of the clusters
of glass sometimes it would flash
along the whole line so rapidly that
all the various combinations of color
and motion seemed to be combined in
one and then for a time each particu-
lar set of fireworks would blaze
sparkle and coruscate by itself scat-
tering particles of colored light as if
they had been real sparks of fire

  this curious and beautiful exhibi-
tion of miniature pyrotechnics was
extremely interesting to the audience
who gazed upward with rapt and
eager attention at the line of wheels
stars and revolving spheres so far
as interest gave evidence of satisfac-
tion there was never a better satisfied
audience at first there had been
some hushed murmurs of pleasure
but very soon the attention of every-
one seemed so completely engrossed by
the dazzling display that they simply
gazed in silence

  for twenty minutes or longer the
glittering show went on and not a
sign of weariness or inattention was
made by any one of the assembled
company then gradually the colors
of the little fireworks faded the stars
and wheels revolved more slowly the
lights in the body of the theater were
gradually raised and the stage cur-
tain went softly down

  anxiously and a little pale her-
bert loring peered through the loop-
hole in the curtain it was not easy to
judge of the effects of his exhibition
and he did not know whether or not it
had been a success there was no ap-
plause but on the other hand there
was no sign that anyone resented the
exhibition as a childish display of
colored lights it was impossible to
look upon that audience without be-
lieving that they had been thoroughly
interested in wthat they had seen and
that they expected to see more

  for two or three minutes loring
gazed through his loophole and then
still with some doubt in his heart but
with a little more olor in his cheeks
the magic egg



he prepared for the second part of his
performance

  at this moment there entered the
theater at the very back of the house
a young lady she was handsome and
well-dressed and as she opened the
door-loring had employed no ushers
or other assistants in this little social
performance-she paused for a mo-
ment and looked into the theater and
then noiselessly stepped to a chair in
the back row and sat down

  this was edith starr who a month
before had been betrothed to herbert
loring edith and her mother had
been invited to this performance and
front seats had been reserved for
them for each guest had received a
numbered card but mis starr had a
headache and could not go out that
afternoon and for a time her daugh-
ter had thought that she too must
give up the pleasure loring had
promised her and stay with her
mother but when the elder lady
dropped into a quiet sleep edith
thought that late as it was she would
go by herself and see what she could
of the performance

  she was quite certain that if her
presence were known to loring he
would stop whatever he was doing un-
til she had been provided with a seat
which he thought suitable for her for
he had made a point of her being
properly seated when he gave the
invitations therefore being equally
desirous of not disturbing the per-
formance and of not being herself
conspicuous she sat behind two rather
largo men where she could see the
stage perfectly well but where she
herself would not be likely to be seen

in a few moments the curtain rose
and loring came forward carry-
ing a small light table which he
placed near the front of the stage and
for a moment stood quietly by it
edith noticed upon his face the ex-
pression of uncertainty and anxiety
which had not yet left it standing
by the side of the table and speaking

very slowly but so clearly that his
words could be heard distinctly in all
parts of the room he began some in-
troductory remarks regarding the sec-
ond part of his performance

  the extraordinary and i may
say marvelous thing which i am
about to show you he said is
known among east indian magicians
as the magic egg the exhibition is a
very uncommon one and has seldom
been seen by americans or euro-
peans and it was by a piece of rare
good fortune that i became possessed
of the appliances necessary for this
exhibition they are indeed very few
and simple but never before to the
best of my knowledge and belief have
they been seen outside of india 

     i will now get the little box which
contains the articles necessary for this
magical performance and i will say
that if i had time to tell you of the
strange and amazing adventure which
resulted in my possession of this box
i am sure you would be as much in-
terested in that as i expect you to be
in the contents of the box but in or-
der that none of you may think this
is an ordinary trick executed by
means of concealed traps or doors i
wish you to take particular notice of
this table which is as you see a plain
unpainted pine table with nothing but
a flat top and four straight legs at
the corners you can see under and
around it and it gives no opportunity
to conceal anything then stand-
ing for a few moments as if he had
something else to say he turned and
stepped toward one of the wings

  edith was troubled as she looked at
her lover during these remarks her
interest was great-greater indeed
than that of the people about her-
but it was not a pleasant interest
as loring stopped speaking and
looked about him there was a momen-
tary flush on his face she knew this
was caused by excitement and she
was pale from the same cause

  very soon loring came forward
and stood by the table

weird tales

  here is the box he said of
whieh i spoke and as i hold it up i
think you can all see it it is not large
being certainly not more than twelve
inches in length and two deep but it
contains some very wonderful things
the outside of this box is covered with
delicate engraving and carving which
you can not see and these marks and
lines have i think some magical
meaning but i do not know what it
is i will now open the box and show
you what is inside the first thing i
take out is this little stick not thicker
than a lead-pencil but somewhat
longer as you see this is a magical
wand and is covered with inscrip-
tions of the same character as those
on the outside of the box the next
thing is this little red bag well filled
as you see which i shall put on the
table for i shall not yet need it

  now i take out a piece of cloth
which is folded into a very small com-
pass but as i unfold it you will per-
ceive that it is more than a foot
square and is covered with embroid-
ery all those strange lines and fig-
ures in gold and red whieh you can
plainly see on the cloth as i hold it
up are also characters in the same
magic language as those on the box
and wand i will now spread the cloth
on the table and then take out the
only remaining thing in the box and
this is nothing in the world but an
egg-a simple ordinary hens egg as
you all see as i hold it up it may be
a trifle larger than an ordinary egg
but then after all it is nothing but a
common egg-that is in appearance
in reality it is a good deal more

  now i will begin the perform-
ance and as he stood by the back
of the table over which he had been
slightly bending and threw his eyes
over the audience his voice was
stronger and his face had lost all its
pallor he was evidently warming up
with his subject

 i now take up this wand he
said which while i hold it gives
me power to produce the phenomena

which you are about to behold you
may not all believe that there is any
magic whatever about this little per-
formance and that it is all a bit of
machinery but whatever you may
think about it you shall see what you
shall see

  now with this wand i gently touch
this egg which is lying on the square
of cloth i do not believe you can see
what has happened to this egg but i
will tell you there is a little line like
a hair entirely around it now that
line has become a crack now you can
see it i know it grows wider and
wider look the shell of the egg is
separating in the middle the whole
egg slightly moves do you notice
that now you can see something yel-
low showing itself between the two
parts of the shell see it is moving a
good deal and the two halves of the
shell are separating more and more
and now out tumbles this queer little
object do you see what it is  it is a
poor weak little chick not able to
stand but alive-alive you can all
perceive that it is alive now you can
see that it is standing on its feet
feebly enough but still standing

  behold it takes a few steps you
can not doubt that it is alive and
came out of that egg it is beginning
to walk about over the cloth do you
notice that it is picking the embroid-
ery  now little chick i will give you
something to eat this little red bag
contains grain a magical grain with
which i shall feed the chicken you
must excuse my awkwardness in open-
ing the bag as i still hold the wand
but this little stick i must not drop
see little chick there are some grains
they look like rice but in fact i have
no ideu what they are but he knows
he knows look at him see how he
pieks it up there he has swallowed
one two three that will do little
chick for a first meal

   the grain seems to have strength-
ened him already for see how lively
he is and how his yellow down stands
out on him so puffy and warm you
the magic egg



are looking for some more grain are
yon well you can not have it just
yet and keep away from those pieces
of egg-shell which by the way i will
put back into the box now sir try
to avoid the edge of the table and to
quiet you i will give you a little tap
on the back with my wand now then
please observe closely the down
which just now covered him has al-
most gone he is really a good deal
bigger and ever so much uglier see
the little pin-feathers sticking out
over him some spots here and there
are almost bare but he is ever so
much more active ha listen to that 
he is so strong that you can hear his
beak as he pecks at the table he is
actually growing bigger and bigger
before our very eyes see that funny
little tail how it begins to stick up
and quills are showing at the end of
his wings

  another tap and a few more
grains careful sir dont tear the
cloth see how rapidly he grows he
is fairly covered with feathers red
and blaek with a tip of yellow in
front you could hardly get that fel-
low into an ostrich egg now then
what do you think of him he is big
enough for a broiler though i dont
think anyone would want to take him
for that purpose some more grain
and another tap from my wand see
he does not mind the little stick for
he has been used to it from his very
birth now then he is what you would
eall a good half-grown chick rather
more than half grown i should say
do you notice his tail there is no
mistaking him for a pullet the long
feathers are beginning to curl over
already he must have a little more
grain look out sir or you will be
off the table come back here this
table is too small for him but if he
were on the floor you could not see
him so well

  another tap now see that comb
on the top of his head you scarcely
noticed it before and now it is bright
red and see his spurs beginning to

show-on good thief legs too there
is a fine young fellow for you look
how he jerks his head from side to
side like the young prince of a poul-
try-yard as he well deserves to be
the attentive interest which had at
first characterized the audience now
changed to excited admiration and
amazement some leaned forward
with mouths wide open others stood
up so that they could see better
ejaculations of astonishment and
wonder were heard on every side and
a more thoroughly fascinated and ab-
sorbed audience was never seen

  now my friends loring con-
tinued i will give this handsome
fowl another tap behold the result-
a noble full-grown cock behold his
spurs they are nearly an inch long
see there is a comb for you and
what a magnificent tail of green and
black contrasting so finely with the
deep red of the rest of his body well
sir you are truly too big for this
table as i can not give you more
room i will set you up higher move
over a little and i will set this chair
on the table there up on the seat
thats right but dont stop there is
the back which is higher yet up
with you ha there he nearly upset
the chair but i will hold it see he
has turned around nov then look
at him see his wings as he flaps
them he could fly with such wings
look at him see that swelling
breast ha ha listen did you ever
hear a crow like that it fairly rings
through the house yes i knew it
there is another  

  at this point the people in the
house were in a state of wild excite-
ment nearly all of them were on
their feet and they were in such a
condition of frantic enthusiasm that
loring was afraid some of them might
make a run for the stage

  come sir cried loring now al-
most shouting that will do you
have shown us the strength of your
lungs jump down on the seat of the
chair now on the table there i will


weird tales

take away the chair and yon can
stand for a moment on the table and
let our friends look at you but only
for a moment take that tap on your
back now do you see any difference
perhaps you may not but i do yes
i believe you all do he is not the big
fellow he was a minute ago he is
really smaller only a fine cockerel a
nice tail that but with none of the
noble sweep that it had a minute ago
no dont try to get off the table you
cant escape my wand another tap
behold a half-grown chicken good to
eat but with not a crow in him hun-
gry are you but you need not pick
at the table that way you get no
more grain but only this little tap
ha ha what are you coming to
there is a chicken barely feathered
enough for us to tell what color he is
going to be

  another tap will take still more
of the conceit out of him look at
him there are his pin-featliers and
his bare spots dont try to get away
i can easily tap you again now then
here is a lovely little chick fluffy
with yellow down he is active
enough but i shall quiet him one
tap and now what do you see a poor
feeble chicken scarcely able to stand
with his down all packed close to him
as if he had been out in the rain ah
little chick i will take the two halves
of the egg-shell from which you came
and put them on each side of you
come now get in i close them up
you are lost to view there is nothing
to be seen but a crack around the
shell now it has gone there my
friends as i hold it on high behold
the magic egg exactly as it was when
i first took it out of the box into
which i will place it again with the
cloth and the wand and the little red
bag and shut it up with a snap i
will let you take one more look at this
box before i put it away behind the
scenes are you satisfied with what i
have shown you do you think it is
really as wonderful as you supposed
it would be

  at these words the whole audience
burst into riotous applause during
which loring disappeared- but he
was back in a moment

 thank you he cried bowing
low and waving his arms before him
in the manner of an eastern magician
making a salaam from side to side
lie turned bowing and thanking and
then with a hearty   good-bye to you
good-bye to you all  he stepped back
and let down the curtain

  for some moments the audience re-
mained in their seats as if they were
expecting something more and then
they rose quietly and began to dis-
perse most of them were acquainted
with one another and there was a
good deal of greeting and talking as
they went out of the theater

  when loring was sure the last per-
son had departed he turned down the
lights locked the door and gave the
key to the steward of the club

 he walked to his home a happy
man his exhibition had been a per-
fect success with not a break or a
flaw in it from beginning to end

  i feel thought the young man
as he strode along as if i could fly
to the top of that steeple and flap
and crow until all the world heard
me

that evening as was his daily cus-
tom herbert loring called upon
miss starr he found the young lady
in the library

  i came in here she said be-
cause i have a good deal to talk to
you about and i do not want inter-
ruptions  

  with this arrangement the young
man expressed his entire satisfaction
and immediately began to inquire the
cause of her absence from his exhibi-
tion hi the afternoon

  but i was there said edith
you did not see me but i was there
mother had a headache and i went
by myself

  you were there exclaimed lor-
ing almost starting from his chair

    a research worker is demonstrating

weird tales

i dont understand you were not in
your seat

  no answered edith i was on
the very back row of seats you could
not see me and i did not wish you to
see me

  edith exclaimed loring rising
to his feet and leaning over the li-
brary table whieh was between them
when did you come how much of
the performance did you see

  i was late she said i did not
arrive until after the fireworks or
whatever they were  

  for a moment loring was silent as
if he did not understand the situa-
tion

fireworks he said how did
you know there had been fireworks
i heard the people talking of them
as they left the theater she an-
swered

  and what did they say he in-
quired quickly

  they seemed to like them very
well she replied but i do not
think they were quite satisfied from
what i heard some persons say i in-
ferred that they thought it was not
very much of a show to which you
had invited them

  again loring stood in thought
looking down at the table but before
he could speak again edith sprang to
her feet

     herbert loring   she cried   what
does all this mean i was there dur-
ing the whole of the exhibition of
what you called the magic egg i saw
all those people wild with excitement
at the wonderful sight of the chicken
that came out of the egg and grew to
full size and then dwindled down
again and went back into the egg
and herbert there was no egg and
there was no little box and there was
no wand and no embroidered cloth
and there was no red bag nor any
little chick and there was no full-
grown fowl and there was no chair
that you put on the table there was

nothing absolutely nothing but you
and that table and even the table
was not what you said it was it was
not an unpainted pine table with four
straight legs it was a table of dark
polished wood and it stood on a
single post with feet there was
nothing there that you said was there
everything was a sham and a delu-
sion every word you spoke was un-
true and yet everybody in that
theater excepting you and me saw
all the things that you said were on
the stage i know they saw them all
for i was with the people and heard
them and saw them and at times i
fairly felt the thrill of enthusiasm
which possessed them as they glared
at the miracles and wonders you said
were happening  

  loring smiled   sit down my dear
edith he said you are excited
and there is not the slightest cause for
it i will explain the whole affair to
you it is simple enough you know
that study is the great object of my
life i study all sorts of tilings and
just now i am greatly interested in
hypnotism the subject has become
fascinating to me i have made a
great many successful trials of my
power and the affair of this after-
noon was nothing but a trial of my
powers on a more extensive scale than
anything i have yet attempted i
wanted to see if it were possible for
me to hypnotize a considerable num-
ber of people without anyone suspect-
ing what i intended to do the result
was a success i hypnotized all those
people by means of the first part of
my performance which consisted of
some combinations of colored glass
with lights thrown upon them they
revolved and looked like fireworks
and were strung on a wire high up on
the stage

  i kept up the glittering and daz-
zling show-which was well worth
seeing i can assure you-until the
people had been straining their eyes
upward for almost half an hour and
this sort of thing-i will tell you if

weird tales

you do not know it-is one of the
methods of producing hypnotic sleep

 there was no one present who
was not an impressionable subject
for i was very careful in sending out
my invitations and when i became al-
most certain that my audience was
thoroughly hypnotized i stopped the
show and began the real exhibition
which was not really for their benefit
but for mine

  of course i was dreadfully anx-
ious for fear i had not succeeded en-
tirely and that there might be at least
some one person who had not suc-
cumbed to the hypnotic influences
and so i tested the matter by bringing
out that table and telling them it was
something it was not if i had had
any reason for supposing that some of
the audience saw the table as it really
was i had an explanation ready and
i could have retired from my position
without anyone supposing that i had
intended making hypnotic experi-
ments the rest of the exhibtion would
have been some things that any one
could see and as soon as possible i
would have released from their spell
those who were hypnotized but when
i became positively assured that
everyone saw a light pine table with
four straight legs i confidently went
on with the performances of the
magic egg

  edith starr was still standing by
the library table she had not heeded
lorings advice to sit down and she
was trembling with emotion

  herbert loring she said you
invited my mother and me to that ex-
hibition you gave us tickets for front
seats where we would be certain to be
hypnotized if your experiment suc-
ceeded and you would have made us
see that false show which faded from
those peoples minds as soon as they
recovered from the spell for as they
went away they were talking only of
the fireworks and not one of them
mentioned a magic egg or a chicken
or anything of the land answer me
this did you not intend that i should

come and be put under that spell
loring smiled  yes  he said   of
course i did but then your case
would have been different from that
of the other spectators for i should
have explained the whole thing to
you and i am sure we would have
had a great deal of pleasure and
profit too in discussing your experi-
ences the subject is extremely-

  explain to me she cried you
would not have dared to do it i do
not know how brave you may be but
i know you would not have had the
courage to come here and tell me that
you had taken away my reason and
my judgment as you took them away
from all those people and that you
had made me a mere tool of your will
-glaring and panting with excite-
ment at the wonderful things you
told me to see where nothing existed
i have nothing to say about the
others they can speak for themselves
if they ever come to know what you
did to them i speak for myself i
stood up with the rest of the people i
gazed with all my power and over
and over again i asked myself if it
could be possible that anything was
the matter with my eyes or my brain
and if i could be the only person
there who could not see the marvelous
spectacle that you were describing
but now  know that nothing was
real not even the little pine table not
even the man  

  not even me exclaimed loring
  surely i was real enough  

  on that stage yest she said
but you there proved you were not
the herbert loring to whom i prom-
ised myself he was an unreal being
if he had existed he would not have
been a man who would have brought
me to that public place all ignorant
of his intentions to cloud my percep-
tions to subject my intellect to his
own and make me believe a lie if a
man should treat me in that way once
he would treat me so at other times
and in other ways if he had th
chance you have treated me in the
weird tales



past as today you treated those peo-
ple who glared at the magic egg in
the days gone by you made me see an
unreal man but you will never do it
again good-bye

 edith cried loring you

dont-

  but she had disappeared through a
side door and he never spoke to her
again

  walking home through the dimly
lighted streets loring involuntarily
spoke aloud

  and this he saidis what came
out of the magic egg

 the brain-thief

continued from page 

pose of the all-conquering west
frenziedly he clutched at his maimed
arm shrinking from de grandins
blazing eyes and menacing steel as a
beaten dog might flinch from an
angry master

  he was a pitiable object as he
crouched and cowered in his chair
and despite the heartless cruelties he
had confessed i felt a wave of com-
passion for him

  mercy he implored shrinking
still further from the frenchman
have pity sahib you have con-
quered be merciful

hot as molten lava from a volcanic
crater cold and hard as polar ice

hand and to her innocent babe slain
by your devilishness as surely as
though your accursed hands had done
the deed-such mercy as that you may
expect from jules de grandin

  trowbridge my good one he
called over his shoulder take them
out lead messieurs norton and ab-
bot and madame marjorie to the
front gate and await me i have one
damnably pleasant duty to perform
here and can not be annoyed by your
mistakenly merciful expostulations
aluz- vo us-en-tout vite  

  we turned and left him for there
was a look of command in his face
which would not be denied but as we
left i cast a single backward look
then hurried on for in that fleeting
glance i saw de grandin seize the
hindoos neck between his slim
strong hands and force his writhing
face toward the glowing barrel of the
red-hot stove

  a scream of unsupportable anguish
echoed through the night as we
reached the gate but i pushed my
companions before me dont go
back i urged hes getting only
what he deserves but we couldnt
bear to watch it even so  

it was some ten minutes later as we
trudged along the turnpike toward
the nearest interurban bus station that
marjorie abbot who walked stiffly as
a robot beside her husband suddenly
threw her hand to her brow and burst
into a fit of wild uncontrollable
weeping ilomer-oh homer she
cried my dear i can tell you now
i love you dear i love you-i didnt
mean to do it homer truly i didnt
but he made me oh my dear dear
love i dont understand it but im
free vm free my lips arent sealed
any longer

  jules de grandin chuckled delight-
edly mats oid mais certainement
madamehe laughed and never
again shall that butter-faced son ol a
most unsavory and entirely immoral

pig hold you or any woman in his
thrall no by damn it jules de gran-
din has made entirely certain of that
yes to be sure

  a few minutes more we walked
homer and marjorie holding hands as
frankly as country sweethearts while
they murmured soft foolish little en-
dearments in each others ears then

  tiens monsieur look not so down-
hearted de grandin ordered kit
norton tomorrow morning you
and i-yes and the good slow-witted
trowbridge too-shall seek out ma-
dame isabel and tell her the true state
of affairs she loves you moti vieux
ill swear to it and when she learns
that what you did was not of your
doing but because of the black magic
of that most damnable time-thief
whom i have just sent to his proper
place i bet me your life she will
understand and forgive and you and
she shall once more be happy in each
others company

  not here he added after a mo-
ments thought the townsfolk
would never understand and your re-
marriage to madame isabel so soonly
after poor madame bettys tragic
death-it would make fresh scandal
for gossiping tongues to fondle but
there are other places and i damn
think one place is good as another or
better when love is your companion
nest-ce-pas friend trowbridge   he
dug a sharp elbow into my ribs



oeehere de grandin i remarked

   next morning at breakfast as i
scanned the headlines of my paper
that house we visited last night
burned down heres the story

man dies in mystery blaze

  fire of undetermined origin completely
destroyed the old spencer homestead five
miles from harrisonville late last night
the house a frame structure has been
occupied by an east indian gentleman mr
chunda lai for the past several years it
contained no modern improvements and it
weird tales



is thought the flames started from an over-
heated coal stove or an overturned oil lamp

   the blaze waa first noticed by neighbors
who lived a mile or more away about one
oclock this morning but the place was
practically demolished before they could
arrive on the scene search of the still
smoking ruins today revealed a human body
charred past possibility of recognition
among the dubris it is feared the unfor-
tunate tenant perished in the fire the loss
amounting to  was covered by in-
surance

  um murmured jules de gran-
din as he returned the paper the
account is graphic though a trifle in-
accurate howeverly i fear i shall
not point out the errors to the excel-
lent journalist who wrote the story
no it would be better not

  but its strange the house should
have burned last night i returned
i suppose its one of those fortunate
accidents which-

  non not at all by no means he
cut in it would have been strange
had it been otherwise my friend for
i took greatest pains that things
should be exactly as they were after
i had impressed on this monsieur
chunda lai that it is extremely poor
policy to trifle with other peoples
wives and husbands-that hot stove
proved of greatest help in the process
i assure you-i carefully bound him
in his chair then arranged an alarm
clock in such a way that it would
spring the stove door open when one
oclock arrived the door once open
a flood of glowing coals fell outward
on the floor which i had previously
drenched with kerosene-and the in-
evitable process of combustion took
place however the east indian
gentleman of whom the paper speaks
suffered no inconvenience thereby
since his soul had gone to the sub-
cellar of hell some hours earlier

  you remember how poor madame
marjorie suddenly regained mastery
of herself as we proceeded down the
road last night he asked

  yes of course

  very good it was at that moment

what made his
hair grow

read his letter for the answer

two years ago i was
bald all over the top of the
head

i felt ashamed for people
to see my head i tried to
overepme this but i remained
bald until i used kotalko

immediately and kept on
growing in a short time i
had a splendid head of hair
which has been perfect ever
since-and no return of the
baldness

this statement is by

weird tales

the rascally one departed this world
for a place of everlasting torment i
had been at particular pains not to
bind his wound and-one can not
bleed for long and remain alive you
know my friend the entirely un-
lamented chunda lai and his power
over madame marjorie expired at the
same happy instant yes

  but do you mean he actually did
all those things he boasted of i de-
manded is it possible a man no
matter how clever he might be as a
hypnotist could so entirely change
peoples natures as he claimed to have
done  why it seems incredible  

  i agree the frenchman nodded
but nevertheless it are true con-
sider in india where he came from
the fakirs perform certain tricks
which are explicable only by hyp-
notism the rope trick by example
he declared he could perform it and
it is one of the few unexplained east-
ern illusions they apparently throw
a cord into the air make it fast to
nothing at all then climb it until they
are lost to sight no one has ever ex-
plained that your own monsieur
herman the magician tells in his
memoirs how he offered much money
to anyone who would show him the
technique of the illusion but no one
came forward to claim the reward
why because it is a mere illusion of
the eye-a piece of superhypnotism

  consider the evidence here mon-
sieur norton tells how just before he
apparently became a knave of the
first water he encountered this evil
time-thief in a theater lobby and how
the despicable one waved a bright-set
ring before his eyes that single flash
was enough to center the victims at-
tention just what the relationship
between the optic nerves and the
brain centers of ratiocination is we
do not certainly know but all psychol-
ogists are agreed that shining objects
or swiftly whirling objects which con-
fuse or blind the eyes put the subject
in ideal condition for quick and easy

hypnosis in any event while mon-
sieur nortons thought-guards were
overwhelmed by the flashing of that
ring the brain-thief leaped in and
took complete possession of his con-
sciousness captured his will and made
him break the heart of the wife he
loved

  how the villain captured poor ma-
dame bettys mind we do not know
but we have the young abbots story
of how his wife was overcome by the
quick flash of a bright object in the
night club and we have the evidence
of the complete control the miscreant
established over madame marjorie
certainly it is all most unusual and
instances of such hypnotism are for-
tunately rare but we have seen what
we have seen in this case two lives
were destroyed and the happiness of
madame bettys first husband de-
molished completely had it not been
for jules de grandin both monsieur
norton and madame isabel as well as
monsieur and madame abbot might
also have been made helpless victims
of the vile ones plottings

  parblm when i recall the evil
that one wrought it makes me entirely
ill quick trowbridge my friend
assist me my mouth is filled with a
most unpleasant taste at the very
thought of that never-enough-to-be-
accursed man with the yellow face
nothing but a drink-a nobly large
drink-of brandy will remove it

 doom in the fires about them that we
 could turn on the vibrations at
 once though those vibrations halted
 our plunge since they instantly
 annihilated the pull of all the gal-
 axy s suns upon our worlds and upon
 each other

   with that pull destroyed our
 ring of worlds halted at the very
 edge of doom were the pull of those
 suns restored they would jerk us
 into those fires at once we knew but
 we knew too that with their attrac-
 tion upon each other nullified the

 maining here so you see how use-
 less how amusing even it is to ask
 me how to turn off the vibration
 that is disintegrating your galaxy
 your single ship could never get
 near the central control of the vibra-
 tions through the swarms of squares
 and of my cube-creature races that
 have answered the alarm by now
 that guard it and even at this
 moment those great vibrations are
 breaking up your universe forever

   the mechanical metallic voice
 from the cabinet ceased and the
 cube-creature whose thoughts it had
 spoken contemplated us with cool
 contempt and amusement flickering in
 his alien eyes jhan jal mirk en
 myself and all our crew-members
 about us were silent for the moment
 then jhan jal pointed slowly to-
 ward the time-dial on the wall

weird tales

forever out of the reach of its
swarm the twentieth hour-and
never can we reach the cube of con-
trols through the swarms of squares
that guard it weve failed

  not failed i cried theres
a chance yet to halt those vibrations
-a chance to get down through
those guarding squares with this
square of the cube-creatures bound
to our cruiser-

  swiftly i explained to jhan jal
and mirk en the plan that had sug-
gested itself to me and their eyes
gleamed with sudden hope our crew
rushing to its stations mirk en and
i guarding for the moment the cube-
creature jhan jal raced up to the
control room and sent our cruiser
and the square bound to it humming
back toward the world from whieh
we had fled just inside its at-
mosphere we halted and though we
could see great swarms of squares
crowded with cube-creatures they
did not glimpse us high above them
and then mirk en and i with the
crews help swiftly made ready for
our wild feat opening the space-
door we gathered the dead of our
own crew on the square beside our
cruiser and brought them inside the
ship the cube-creature dead we
stripped of their space-suits and
arranged them in natural positions
here and there on the surface of the
sqjiare when we had finished it
seemed to all appearances that the
square beside our ship was crowded
with living cube-creatures like those
below since they had died for the
most part y the piercing of their
space-suits and bore but few marks
of battle they seemed crouching
there on the squares surface as when
living

  and now mirk en and i with the
captured little cube-creature walked
out onto the surfaee of the square
toward the bulge that held its simple
button-controls i held a thick metal
bar sharpened at one end and mirk

en held in his tentacles four of the
same bars we had shown these bars
to the cube-creature before leaving
the cruiser and through the thought-
speech machine had told him that if
he followed our orders his life would
be spared but that if he attempted
to discover to the other squares and
cube-creatures our stratagem instant
death would be his then crouching
before that bulges buttons the cube-
creature seemed to all eyes the
operator of the great square the
dozens of posed dead creatures be-
hind him his fellows and mirk en
and i our bars hidden two captives

  the great band of metal that se-
cured our cruiser to the square we
left in place but beside us was the
device by which a thrown lever
would release that band instantly
so now with jhan jal making a
final gesture toward us from the
cruisers transparent-walled control
room we started downward our pro-
pulsion-mechanisms silent now the
cube-creature beside us operating the
great squares propulsion-mechanism
and sending it smoothly downward
with our cruiser attached to it with
mirk en and me apparently captives
among the dozens of cubc-men on
the square it seemed that our cruiser
had been captured by the square
and its cube-creatures and that they
were returning with their prize it
was upon that appearance at least
that we were depending to prevent
the break-up of the galaxy to turn
off the great vibrations before the
last minutes of the twentieth hour
had passed

  downward toward the surface of
the gleaming world we shot the
cruiser pulled down with the sinking
square none inside that cruiser
showing its space-door open with
pounding heart i crouched there
gazing across the metal-burnished
surface of the world beneath across
the giant cube-buildings and the
great masses of squares loaded with
weird tales



cube-creatures that came and went
still above them those squares we
saw had collected in great swirling
masses above and around the green-
glowing square of force and the
cube of controls beside that glowing
square could we penetrate down
through them to that control-cube 
already scores of those squares were
rushing up toward us and i turned
to mirk en as the cube-creature be-
side us sent square and cruiser
dropping still lower

  kill him instantly if he tries to
signal to the cube-creatures on these
squares i muttered to the vegan
and he nodded

  nows the moment he breathed
if we can pass these squares well
have a chance if not-

  but now those uprushing squares
were flashing all around us their
cube-creature occupants gazing in-
tently toward us as they saw square
and cruiser come down thus toward
their world together for a moment
i held my breath a moment in which
they gazed down and across our
square its dead cube-creatures posed
behind us its cube-creature operator
-and mirk en and i crouching as
though helpless beside him-and in
that moment a single eye that dis-
covered our deception would send a
blast of green crumpling force to-
ward us i knew but no green beam
came deceived by the life-like ap-
pearance of the dead things behind
us by the lifeless and captured ap-
pearance of our cruiser they never
doubted apparently that their fellow-
square had captured our ship we
sank swiftly among them and they
dropped down in great swarms all
about us

weird tales

and we would lie within striking dis-
tance of that cube i knew moments
more and the crimson rays of our
cruiser would whiff it from exist-
ence from the time-dial on my arm
i saw that the last few minutes of
our last hour were fleeting now but
even those minutes would be enough
i knew if we wrere not discovered
and still we were dropping lower
through the swarms of squares that
swirled as though in exultation at
our capture about and beneath us i
saw the hope in my own eyes re-
flected in mirk ens and at that
moment came the catastrophe one
of the squares about us brushed
close for a moment to the edge of our
own and tvs it did so tho cube-crea-
ture between mirk en and me leaped
upward and uttered a strange
throaty cry

  even as that cry left the cube-
creatures mouth-aperture mirk ens
metal bars had crashed down
through its body and he whirled
toward me its all up nort no-
rus he yelled the things given
us away

  but in that same instant as the
cube-creatures on the squares all
about us gazed stupefiedly toward us
i flung loose the great band that held
our cruiser to the square and then
with my hands on that squares but-
tons i sent it whirling downward

	the cube-control i cried well
fight our way down to it or die try-
ing

 in that moment our square was
crashing through the swarming

squares about it whose cube-crea-
tures seemed stunned by the sudden
revelation of our stratagem but in
the next moment a hundred green
beams were cleaving toward our
square and toward the cruiser a little
above with a wild sidewise swoop
of the square i sought to avoid those
beams in that crazy moment and at
the same time saw mirk ens ten-
tacles flashing over the little levers

beside me and from our own

squares bulges similar green deadly
shafts were stabbing back in answer
outward they drove from us in blind
destruction through the masses of
squares about and beneath us as
those squares crumpled and fell in
scores as a mighty wraxing roar of
alarm went over the surface of the
world beneath i glimpsed our
cruiser above writh jhan jal at its
controls stabbing out lightning-like
to right and left with its crimson
rays as it plunged down above us

  down through the wildly whirling
masses of squares laden with cube-
creatures our own square shot as i
pressed upon the buttons that con-
trolled it as mirk en sent its green
beams driving outward my only
memory of the next moments is of
a wild confusion of tossing rushing
squares a sea of metal shapes
covered with crowding cube-crea-
tures of other squares rushing from
far away as the great alarm went
forth it seemed incredible to me
even in that moment of awful action
that we could escape the beams that
drove thick about us but it was the
very numbers of the squares about
us that saved us from annihilation
impeded as they were by the rushing
numbers behind them the squares on
all sides of us could hardly in that
wild moment distinguish between
our own square and those about us
so that for the moment it seemed
almost that all the rushing squares
about us were loosing their beams at
each other in a wild panic of con-
fusion

  crash - crash - crash - down
through the mass of squares i drove
crashing into and through them like
a mighty battering-ram of metal
down toward the cube of controls
that loomed close now beneath us
the great green force of the square
glowing beside it through the
opening in the side of that upraised
cube i could glimpse the myriad
weird tales



intricate switches and instruments
inside it the half-dozen cube-crea-
tures in it and then as mirk en
sent our beams smashing through the
squares beneath us i drove down
through the opening the beams had
made for us until we hung for a
split-second beside the cube of con-
trols

  a hundred green rays darted down
toward our square as we hung there
but in the instant before they
reached us mirk en and i had
leaped great bars in our grasp into
the cube beside us and as the square
from which we leaped crumpled and
fell as the cube-creatures on the
ground ran madly toward the ladder
that led up to the raised cube not
daring to loose their rays upon their
great control the half-dozen crea-
tures inside leapt toward us but as
they did so there towered before
them the terrific spectacle of mirk
en the fighting vegans great octo-
pus-tentacles upraised in air and
then his bars and my own crashed
down upon those creatures and left
them dead up the ladder were
springing other creatures but mirk
en beat them down with terrific
blows of his great arms while our
cruiser above fought and whirled
still with the down-rushing squares
and i turned toward the switches
about me

  scores upon scores in numbers
those switches were unthinkably
intricate combinations of levers and
buttons and dials and for the mo-
ment i gazed at them in despair
then raising my great bar sent it
smashing through them blow after
blow i let fall upon them wrecking
the cub e-controls interior but still
the green force of the great square
was glowing and now in despair at
sight of what i was doing the swarm-
ing cube-creatures on the ladder were
pressing mirk en back upward had
jerked the bars from two of his ten-
tacles and were pouring in upon us

weird tales

great blow smashing through the last
of the intricate switches and the
green force in the great square
abruptly vanished and at sight of
that the cube-creatures on the lad-
der those  the crowding squares
above over all this world seemed to
stop stunned stupefied

  the great vibration that had been
disintegrating our galaxy was halted
at last

  in that instant down through the
motionless stupefied creatures on the
squares above our cruiser was rush-
ing down beside the opening of our
cube for a second and in that second
mirk en and i flung ourselves
through the cruisers open space-
door and it was stabbing upward
was flashing away from that worlds
surface through the hordes of
stunned cube-creatures as they
stared motionless toward the cubc
whose glowing force had been so
suddenly snapped out were staring
uncomprehendingly as now at last
the gravitational attraction of the
galaxys suns was restored to them
as those suns exerted again their
pull upon each other and upon this
ring of worlds inside canopus as
they pulled back into the galaxys
swarm those outermost moving suns
that but now had hovered on the
verge in space as they exerted again
their pull upon this ring of worlds
within canopus and as that ring be-
gan to spread still farther toward
canopus encircling fires

  for as our cruiser shot up the
great ring of worlds was spreading
one by one slowly majestically the
groat worlds of that ring were mov-
ing off from its circle in a tangent
toward the fires of canopus and one
by one as we watched we saw them
go to that stunning stupefying doom
that had gripped them once more
with the halting of the vibration saw
them vanishing with all their cube-
creatures and squares and works in
great bursts of flaming vapor as they

passed into the mighty encircling
fires and in the great hollow at
canopus center our cruiser was left
alone

  stunned ourselves in that moment
jhan jal and mirk en and i there in
the cruiser stared out incredulously
into that tremendous space at
canopus center that lay empty now
forever empty of those inner planets
whose cube-creatures had been anni-
hilated before our eyes we could
not speak could not move in that
moment swaying there in the con-
trol room until at last jhan jal sent
our ship racing toward those fires in
turn until my hands opened again
the control of its heat-nullifying gen-
erators of its protective ray-sheath
and then we were rushing again into
great canopus colossal mass of
white flame even as there sounded
beside us the twentieth hours end-
ing were rushing outward through
those fires with all the cruisers
power in that hour that was to have
been the cube-creatures  highest hour
of triumph and that had been in-
stead for them their hour of death



xtort norus chairman of the
     council of suns

  once again that cry was ringing
forth from the attendants on the
great dais and once again with
jhan jal and mirk en behind me i
was stepping up onto that dais fac-
ing the thousands of members of the
council about us but now it was
not with silence that those members
greeted us but with a wild roar of
cheers that reverberated thunder-
ously through the great hall and
that seemed echoed by the distant
cheers that came to us from the re-
joicing crowds in the cities outside
earth man sirian and vegan we
three stood there facing those shout-
ing thousands of dissimilar forms
and then slowly and reluctantly their
weird tales

ns

wild cheers died as i raised a hand

for silence

 members of the council of
suns i spoke to them again we
gather here not this time to consider
a doom hanging over us but to cele- j
brate a doom lifted from us there
at the center of canopus jhan jal
and mirk en and i with pur cruiser
and its crew found the cube-crea-
tures who had loosed that doom upon
our galaxy who were even then
breaking up our galaxy with their
great vibrations and wo were able
at the last to thrust back that doom
to pull back into the galaxy its
farthest out-wandering suns even as
a more terrible doom was loosed
upon the cube-creatures themselves
this we were able to do and for it
you give us your cheers and grati-
tude now yet it is not to us that
you should give them but to those
who ages ago laid the foundations
of our great federation of suns

  for it is through our federation
of suns alone that we have thrust
back this doom and every doom that
has menaced our universe around
this galaxy of ours which our ances-
tors of the far past thought so
mighty and which we know to be so
small there stretch all the mysteries
of space and out of those mysteries
there have come upon us once and
again terrors of which we dreamed
nothing great dooms that have taken
all our power and our wisdom to
withstand but we ave withstood
them always and though none can
doubt that out of the eternal vast-
nesses of the void in which we move
there will come other dooms as
mighty other horrors as terrible by
massing their power and knowledge
our galaxys unlike races shall meet
and withstand those also for if
our races but hold to that great com-
pact sworn by them ages ago if our
mighty federation of suns but con-
tinues to reign we shall hold against
all comers till the end of time this
our universe
