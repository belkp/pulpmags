 this month illustrates a scene from the story entitled bartons

 with which he succeeds in completely incapacitating one of

 gold dust and star dust by cyril g wates this
 time our first prize winning author tackles the fourth dimen-
 sion-a favorite subject about which so much is written and so
 little is known it is no wonder the author finds it necessary
 to put a detective on the job

 the red peril by capt s p meek u s a if it is
 interesting to watch the advance of the machine age it is
 equally interesting and perhaps more important to give a
 thought to the possibilities of future warfare being an army
 man himself our author goes beyond the war in the air
 period and shows us possibilities far more dangerous

 the young old man by earl l bell when the
 meaning of electricity is discovered many new and today
 unthought of uses would probably be found for it for in-
 stance if by a strong enough electric shock life can be taken
 away might it not also be a means for making or perpetu-
 ating life it is an interesting theme to play with and mr
 bell does so in a manner absorbing to the reader

 out of the void an interplanetary serial in  parts
 part ii by leslie f stone the concluding chapters of this
 story gain momentum as they proceed the adventures of
 dana gleason on this planetoid beyond mars are particularly

 fascinating because of the wealth of scientific detail that is
 included in the story

 the twenty-first century limited by paul
 slachta it is hardly likely that the flying experts of today
 will be content to stay for the next hundred years or more

 within the altitudes already reached mr slachta draws an

 it is a great deal more than a story of aviation

 it that enables a dog to understand his masters wishes and
 commands what would be likely to happen if this extra
 sense-and there must be one-were combined with mans
 intelligence much might happen-and much does happen in
 the story

 the white army by dr daniel dressier even the
 layman is greatly concerned over the mechanism and me-
 chanical arrangement of various machines only the human
 machine seems to be taken entirely for granted and is treated
 with a vast amount of indifference yet it is the most mar-
 velous machine of all and as yet has not been capable of
 reproduction in even the slightest degree dr dressier with
 an experts knowledge on the subject weaves a romance
 around it worthy of anybodys careful study

 fessionally if you are not a dentist the interest will be

waste space

                   by t oconor sloane phd

jn many cases space is so abundant that there is
no object in economizing yet as a matter of
geometry to say nothing of other scientific
aspects it is interesting to consider the economy
of space often when we wish to get as near
perfection as possible we go to nature for our
teacher for she far excels us economy of
space however is affected by various circumstances which in
a sense makes it undesirable to attain if we go to geometry
we will find that the largest volume of space to be enclosed
by the smallest partition is a sphere thus baseballs are very
economical in the quantity of horsehide with which they are
supposed to be covered

  now it so happens thit mankind works with tubes and other
volumes constructed on the basis of angles boxes have their
top bottom and sides all at right angles practically they
may be long short high or low in the great majority of cases
all the enclosing parts metal or pasteboard are at right
angles one to the other here there is no economy of wood
or of other enclosing material if we want to adhere to the
idea of economizing our boards and do not abandon the right
angle construction the best we can do is to make a cube of
our box

  it is interesting to recall the fact that the chinese who are
very wonderful artists in their own way adhere pretty closely
to the cube in making their tea boxes if we wish to construct
a house with the greatest economy of enclosing wall and roof
and floor we should make it cubical-its height width and
depth equal this of course is based on the assumption that
there is only one floor an extra floor would complicate the
problem a little

  the bee gives a wonderful example of this economy its
hexagonal cells with so many party walls exhibit the greatest
economy in material for that type of enclosure the stems of
vegetable vegetation are circular in cross-section and represent
an economy of space where indeed it would seem to be hardly
needed

  an interesting example of a sphere in the engineering world
is the spherical gas-holder which has been introduced in the
field of gas-making and which is sometimes of very large
dimensions and holds gas under considerable pressure perhaps
containing three or four times its own volume fruits you

will notice incline very much to the spherical so we can see
that nature does economize

  now suppose we go to the opposite extreme and consider
examples of the most reckless waste of space we need go
to no greater space waster than mother nature let us
take the solar system if the volumes of the planets were
added together and compared with the volume of space which
is devoted to them the waste involved would appear prodigious
the sun in a general way occupies the center of the planetary
system it radiates heat and light in all directions if we let
the outermost planet give us a radius of a sphere a propor-
tionately infinitesimal amount of heat radiated by the sun will
be received by it and the other planets nature is even a greater
waster than she is an economizer if separate calculation were
made for each planet taking its distance from the sun as the
radius of a sphere the waste would be found to be incredibly
great and this is the identical waste that has been going
on for ages and is still going on our sun the glory of the
planetary system may be called an abominable waster and all
the good that we get out of it in the way of light and heat
seems infinitesimal compared to what it is radiating into space
as far as we know this heat is absolutely wasted

  and let us consider another point according to the modern
conception of the atom it is a small planetary system it is
inconceivably minute but is supposed to be made up of parts
which are far more infinitesimal it is supposed to be com-
posed of a nucleus around which negative electrons are ih
constant motion like the planets around our sun in other
words an atom is supposed to consist principally of empty
space whose volume is determined by the orbits of the
planetary electrons as they are sometimes called the atom
is a miniature planetary system with the same waste of space
that characterizes the solar system on this modern theory of
the atom it is fair to say that a lump of lead heavy as it is
impervious to almost everything is principally vacuum or plain
nothing on this theory the atom represents an enormous
waste of space

  for proper and industrious conduct of life the sluggard is
told to go to the ant to consider his ways and be wise in
opposition to this we may say if you want to learn how to
economize space and radiated energy do not go to nature if
you do consider her ways you will often find it advisable to
practice the opposite as far as economy of mechanical energy
is concerned

 


amazing stories

  they spoke in hushed voices and one of their num-
ber kirk paulson by name held the attention of the
group for the moment a tall well-knit young man he
was with the high forehead and solemn eyes of the
student so straight were his shoulders and so haughty
his mien that the gray denim of the toiler suited him
ill

  friends he whispered this is the work of jerome
carter philip barton has become too strong and it is
decreed by the dictator that he must go fools that we
of the despised gray have been to tolerate conditions
as they have developed during the past thirty-eight
years it were better had our parents perished in the
great war with the millions of foolish unfortunates of
the eastern hemisphere

  but what can we do asked one of the listeners

  our time will come replied the speaker as you
all know i am employed in bartons laboratory and
have been educated with his assistance i am probably
closer to the real philip barton than any of his asso-
ciates and i have anticipated a move of this sort for
some time and i know much that is not known by
carter and his council of ten though they have
learned of his sympathies they have not discovered his
secret laboratory where such discoveries are hidden
as will revolutionize our world and pave the way for
the freedom of the masses i cannot tell you more
since the pillars about us may have ears but i can
assure you that this move of the dictators will serve
only to precipitate the action which must eventually
have been taken by the great inventor

  at that moment a red-coated guard stepped from
the shadows and roughly seized a slight wisp of a girl
who lingered near the outskirts of the group the girl
screamed and with a roar like a bull kirk paulson
tore through the little company and landed a terrific
blow on the chin of the officer who still held the girls
thin arm in his crunching grip it was a staggering
punch and the guard reeled and released his grasp of
the sobbing young woman but he recovered and plac-
ing his whistle to his lips blew a shrill blast that would
bring a dozen minions of the law to his assistance
once more kirk swung this time with all the power of
his trained right arm the guard lay still where he fell

  now were in for it gasped kirk this way
friends

  he ducked behind an adjoining pillar and the greater
part of the group trooped after him a few of the
fainter-hearted ran for shelter in other directions as
several more of the red guards appeared on the scene
but at least twelve followed into the shadows that lay
beyond the confines of the square a light pop from
a stubby weapon in the hand of one of the guards sent
a missile spinning through the air-a soft rubbery
something that struck the rearmost of kirks follow-
ers squarely in the middle of the back with a squashing
sound and immediately wrapped twining coils of its
material about his body gripping arms and legs se-
curely and bringing him to the pavement ina helpless
heap

  run run shouted kirk darting into a dark pas-
sageway he drew back at the entrance and allowed
the rest of the panting stumbling humans to pass
when the last one had entered he flung himself against
the heavy door and slammed it shut shooting the bolt
just as the officers reached it

the passage was almost dark being illuminated
only by a narrow beam of light that filtered
through an imperfect floor joint somewhere above but
this was sufficient to reveal the figures of his frightened
followers huddled together only a short distance
ahead

  he produced an electric torch as the pounding on
the door became louder and more insistent the wel-
come radiance of its beam cast grotesque shadows of
the trembling gray-clad fugitives on the walls of the
damp and little-used passage and a feeling of pity
surged through him as he observed their beseeching
fear-ridden countenances

  follow me friends he called out cheerfully lead-
ing the way into another passage where a second door
was bolted behind them

  they clattered down a winding stair that finally
brought them to a chamber with circular stone walls
and an opening in the center of its floor through this
opening dropped the leader and one by one his com-
panions followed they found themselves in another
passage which ended at a metal door of polished new-
ness kirk paulson placed his lips close to a disk of
shiny black that was set in the exact center of the door
and spoke a word in a low tone of voice the door
slowly opened revealing the brightly lighted cage of a
lift

  were safe friends he exulted at least for a
time

  when all had crowded into the lift he spoke another
word of command into a disk adjoining the automatic
operating mechanism on the wall of the cage and with
gradually increasing speed they started upward up
up sped the lift until it seemed they must have reached
the roof of the city two hundred and fifty levels above
their previous position then the motion slowed down
and soon ceased the cage coming to a rest at a gleaming
metal door similar to the one through which they had
entered at the base of the shaft at a word from their
leader this door opened as had the other and they
emerged wonderingly into clean brilliant sunlight

  they were not on the roof rather they were under
its crystal expanse and in the most amazing room they
had ever entered along the walls were many benches
whereon reposed strange machines retorts beakers
and the many instruments and supplies that make up a
complete laboratory equipment kirk laughed at the
bewilderment of his flock

  this is bartons laboratory he announced

  philip barton hurried in at this moment and at
sight of the group of gray-clad refugees he uttered an
exclamation of surprise not unmixed with pleasure

  why kirk he exclaimed what brings you here
with so many of your followers you have heard the
news 

  yes philip was the reply and i have brought
this company by means of the secret lift we were
dispersed by the red guards in the square and were
forced to flee

  are your companions all trustworthy

  yes indeed they are all personally known to me
and i can vouch for each and every one

  then by george you shall all accompany me into
exile are you willing

  the response was overwhelmingly affirmative the
frightened faces of kirks followers taking on a sud-
bartons island



den change in expression-a gleam of hope that trans-
figured them one and all

  then you must be hidden immediately continued
barton lead them into the secret compartments of
the inquisitor kirk the deportation committee will
be here shortly

  thank you philip said kirk hustling his charges
across the great laboratory to the sliding doors that
communicated with the huge chamber which housed
bartons new air yacht the inquisitor

they had no sooner left the room than the com-
mittee appointed to arrange for the banishment of
the barton party arrived on the scene these included
several purple-clad members of the secret service and
though jerome carter had taken great pains to keep
his name from being linked with the proceedings bar-
ton knew his handiwork as well as he did the faces of
certain of his henchmen among the committee the
committee was followed by president haven who
entered with bowed head and with trembling fingers
resting on the arm of his daughter mona barton
with them were two of philips trusted friends who
carter had suggested might accompany him-in
fact the suggestion had been so strongly urged upon
the president that he found it advisable to add their
names to the decree of banishment one of these
friends was jack stems commander of the pacific
coast air patrol the other thomas easton chief
chemist of the synthetic food products corporation

  president haven extended his hand to barton keep-
ing his eyes assiduously from those of the younger man

  its all right dad whispered barton giving the
trembling hand a friendly squeeze i understand and
dont worry about mona we shall outwit carter and
will return victorious one of these fine days i have
a plan-but can not explain now we will be reported
dead but pay no attention-it is to be a ruse of my
own devising i shall find means of communicating
with you secretly keep a stiff upper lip now-the
committee is approaching

  the president now met the steady eyes of the
younger man-met them unwaveringly through the film
of tears which suddenly covered his own

  god bless you my boy he said

the chairman of the committee randall haines
who had cordially detested philip barton since
college days now approached the exiled inventor and
stared insolently at him

  all right barton he growled you know the in-
structions you and mrs barton and your two friends
may as well board the inquisitor at once your be-
longings have been stored on board and all necessary
supplies for your journey are stowed away in the
vessel get moving now

  philip barton deigned no reply but gently disen-
gaged his wifes arms from about the neck of her
father and led her sobbing to the entrance of the in-
quisitors berth president haven stood a forlorn
and helpless figure alone in the midst of the intricate
equipments of the laboratory where barton had spent
the greater part of his time for more than twelve
years past he attempted a smile as philip and mona
bid him a last farewell at the sliding doors but in this
he failed miserably

  bartons small party was conducted to the entrance
of the inquisitor and after his three companions
passed within the inventor was detained by randall
haines

  philip remarked the chairman gloatingly you
are to follow instructions to the letter there is no
escape from the decree signed by your honored father-
in-law you are to proceed with all speed to biscoe
island in the antarctic uninhabited since the great
war there you will find ample opportunity to cool off
and to meditate on the foolhardiness of your recent ac-
tivities in that far-off land you will find many prob-
lems that will tax your incomparable inventive genius-
but your main problem will be to keep alive and well
remember your every move from the moment your
vessel leaves its berth will be followed in the screens
of the secret service detectoscopes-your activities on
biscoe island will be under the constant scrutiny of
operatives of the department should you endeavor
to escape the mandate you will be trailed by one of
the swiftest air patrol vessels of the service and shot
down without mercy now go

  without reply barton entered his vessel and
slammed the door on the laughter of haines and the
other members of the committee he bolted the door
firmly in its air-tight casing and proceeded at once to
the navigating cabin where he found his companions
waiting his wife was still in tears and he patted her
hand comfortingly as he stepped to her side

  dont feel badly dear he said everything is for
the best and we are going to outmaneuver them yet
trust in me

  all right philip she said smiling bravely you
know best and it could not be helped anyway
philip stepped to the control platform and waved a
mocking salute through the port window to the purple-
coated committee that stood stolidly waiting for his
departure

  farewell he chuckled inaudibly you are due
for a shock before long

  haines had pulled a lever alongside the hull of the
vessel and huge sliding panels in the crystal roof over-
head slipped back leaving a clear rectangular opening
to the outer air philip manipulated the controls and
the inquisitor rose vertically from its cradle soaring
rapidly to a great height above the crystal expanse of
the citys upper surface mona and jack sterns gazed
through one of the lower windows at the swiftly reced-
ing black rectangle that marked the spot they had left
tom easton stared moodily at the unfamiliar instru-
ments to which philip barton paid such close attention

  well so far so good laughed philip their sur-
prise comes later

  there was no reply from his companions and he
swung the nose of the vessel about and headed due
south the shimmering expanse of the worlds largest
city rapidly faded from view and they were soon out
over the atlantic off the coast of new jersey speeding
southward at five hundred miles an hour with the
tumbling waters some twenty thousand feet below

in the inquisitor

almost entirely a product of philip bartons
genius the inquisitor was much that it did not
a appear to be it had been carefully searched by
carters henchmen but to them it presented no fea-


amazing stories

tures differing greatly from the many private air yachts
of the wealthy class but a number of secret com-
partments had escaped their careful scrutiny and in
these were many things that would have astounded
them hidden also from alien eyes was kirk paulson
and his group of friends

  philip barton immensely wealthy by inheritance
was of atavistic type early in life he had rebelled
against the selfishness and arrogance of his class not
yet two years of age at the conclusion of the great war
he had grown up with the generation of profiteers who
had increased their wealth enormously and concen-
trated it in powerful groups which eventually ob-
tained complete control of the government when he
was still in his teens he had his first encounter with the
greatest of the industrial giants jerome carter he
had taken an instinctive dislike to the man and as he
matured he watched the unbelievable increase in the
mans wealth and power deeply interested in engi-
neering he had applied himself assiduously to his
studies but this had not prevented him from acquaint-
ing himself with conditions among the working classes
which had grown rapidly worse under the increasing
dominance of jerome carter his interest in the mul-
titude in gray increased as their misfortunes piled up
and became more and more unbearable but his in-
ventive genius was of such value that he was practically
commandeered by the government and had of late
years been very carefully watched and guarded

  seeing that his beloved country was headed for
disaster and for an industrial revolution of colossal
magnitude he bent his thoughts and efforts toward a
solution of the difficulties and the prevention of the
seemingly unavoidable catastrophe his secret ex-
periments were conducted in a laboratory he had
cleverly concealed in the quarters assigned to his use
by the government and the secret equipment of this
laboratory was transferred to a hidden compartment
of the inquisitor when it was completed

  his inventions were in use throughout the civilized
world and were of inestimable value particularly in
the field of air travel it had been his discoveries that
revolutionized aviation in  and brought him into
prominence in the engineering fraternity at the early
age of thirty for nearly three centuries previously
the relation of the gravitational to the electro-magnetic
field was known it having been proved mathematically
in the twentieth century but it remained for philip
barton to discover means of utilizing this knowledge
for the benefit of mankind his method of producing
contra-gravitational fields had eliminated the use of
wings and vertical lifting propellers on all types of air
craft and later his reaction motor obviated the neces-
sity of the horizontal propellers as well and provided
not only much greater fuel economy but entire inde-
pendence of the density of air as a medium for obtain-
ing propulsive effect

  the engine room of the inquisitor was provided with
two contra-field generators each of sufficient power
to support the vessel when fully loaded these gen-
erators were of the most improved type and were con-
nected to fore and aft pole pieces from whence the
contra-gravity flux emanated when these were ener-
gized a field was produced that could be varied in in-
tensity at will as well as reversed if the necessity arose
the basic discovery of the graviton had led barton to

the development of this unique apparatus and the
zenith of perfection had been reached in this particular
portion of the inquisitors mechanism the graviton
be it remembered was identified by barton in the
laboratory as a close analogy to the magneton that
final element of magnetism whose relation to magnetism
is similar to that of the electron to electricity its re-
lation to the earths gravity field being determined it
was a logical though by no means a simple step to the
artificial generation of gravitons both positive and
negative the method of producing a negative gravi-
tonic field surrounding two poles composed of the metal
bartonite was his final development and the world
found itself in the possession of a practical means of
getting away from the surface of the earth by the re-
pulsive force of the opposing fields

  earlier types of air craft using the barton gravitonic
field were propelled horizontally by the old style in-
efficient propeller drawing them through the air at
speeds not much in excess of three hundred miles an
hour when driven by an electric motor that obtained
its power from the energy broadcasts of the etheric
power syndicate philips next efforts were along the
lines of improving the method of propulsion and after
much research he developed the reaction motor which
soon superseded the antiquated propeller drive his
compounding of the new alloy extron provided a ma-
terial that gave off great quantities of electrons when
subjected to an electric current which heated it to not
more than  degrees fahrenheit the reaction motor
was a simple mechanism resembling an electric furnace
to which was attached a lengthy tube of insulating ma-
terial having an inside diameter of nine inches

  the inquisitor was provided with seven of these
motors in the stern and five in the bow their twelve-
foot lengths of tube radiating in the several directions
necessary to permit of discharging their high velocity
ionic streams at any desired angle to provide for the
driving and steering and stopping of the vessel the
discharge ends of the tubes were set flush with the
outer surface of the hull and the extron chambers at
the inner ends were of sufficient capacity to contain ma-
terial for a journey of twenty hours duration without
recharging the heating elements being energized by
collectors that obtained power from the above named
syndicate

  as a precautionary measure against the possible
though not probable failure of both gravitonic field
generators two reaction motors were installed in a
vertical position so that their repelling streams could be
directed earthward while not of sufficient power to
support the vessel completely nor to propel it vertically
these motors would prevent its falling with great
enough speed to cause serious damage thus providing
a valuable safety device

  as a private air yacht the inquisitor was the equal
of any in united north america in other respects it
was far superior to any of true streamline shape two
hundred feet in length and with a maximum diameter
of fifty feet it was a thing of beauty as its silvery nose
pushed southward over the course prescribed by the
banishment decree its luxurious suites and cabins
were unoccupied and silent philip and his three com-
panions remained in the navigating cabin until the coast
line was lost to view

	 
bartons island



jack sterns broke the silence she sure is a
beauty he said referring to the vessel too bad
were not on a pleasure trip rather than speeding to-
ward heaven knows what hardships-thanks to jerome
carter

  oh said philip there wont be many hardships
we are not going to biscoe island as carter so fondly
imagines

  were not asked his wife in astonishment

  no my dear mona were not he replied and
within two hours the newscasters will have spread the
tidings throughout our native land that the inquisitor
has plunged into the ocean with all occupants lost

  his listeners gasped in surprise but it will not be
true asked mona

  itll be true as far as our plunging into the ocean is
concerned said philip but well all be alive and well
and on our way to an entirely different portion of the
globe than carter intended

  how on earth are you going to do it  asked tom
easton

  quite simply philip replied and now i must
take you folks into my confidence the inquisitor is
not what it seems or rather it is much more than it
seems in addition to being a fine air yacht it is a
submarine its double cellular hull and transparent
viewing ports are designed to withstand external pres-
sures as great as one thousand pounds per square inch
of surface i have arranged for some stage effects that
will convince the watchers at the secret service detec-
toscopes that we have met with an accident a charge
of flash powder has been concealed in the engine room
and this will be set off electrically when i press a hidden
button at the control board here the resulting flare
and smoke cloud will do no damage but will completely
obscure the engine room from view of the watchers
and will give the impression that serious damage has
resulted then we must do some acting ourselves-
pretend extreme fear despair and demoralization while
the inquisitor does a nose-dive into the atlantic where
the searching and penetrating rays of the detectoscopes
can not follow a short journey under water will
throw them off the track and we can emerge later and
continue on our way-but not to biscoe island

  he grinned appreciatively at the exclamations of sur-
prise that greeted this announcement

  they can not overhear our conversations with their
detectoscopes can they  asked mona anxiously

  no indeed though i have an instrument hidden
aboard with which that very thing can be accomplished
what is more there are many things in the inquisitor
which they can not even see though they are watching
us closely at this moment and we must be careful
that our expressions do not betray the trend of our con-
versation for one thing there are twelve other per-
sons on board whom you have not seen

  why-where on earth can they be asked tom
and who are they

  there are several secret compartments in the in-
quisitor these are lined with neutroloy an alloy i
have perfected which is impervious to the searching
and penetrating rays of the detectoscope in one of
these compartments is my assistant kirk paulson to-
gether with eleven of his friends in gray

  how wonderful exclaimed mona kirk is a
dear are there any women

  yes answered her husband there are at least
four maybe five i was too hurried to count when i
came upon them in the laboratory they escaped the
red guards in cooper square and kirk brought them
to my laboratory just before we left

  but interrupted jack sterns cant our friends
back in new york and washington discover with their
detectoscopes that there are such compartments that
are invisible to them wont they encounter blank or
opaque spaces with their penetrating rays

  no that is a peculiar property of neutroloy while
it is impervious to the rays as far as disclosing an en-
closed object is concerned it is transparent to them as
regards objects on the far side of the enclosing
chamber they may search the entire ship and will be
unable to find any unaccounted-for space

quppose carter plans treachery suggested tom

     suppose this banishment decree is only a blind
to deceive the public and that he actually intends to
destroy us he might easily order the power syndicate
to contrive an accident and cut off the power broad-
cast

  i have anticipated that possibility also replied
philip in one of the secret compartments there is
a complete generating equipment which can be started
at a moments notice and which would supply suffi-
cient power to carry us to our destination

  there is not much you havent thought of is
there asked jack admiringly

  i hope not was the anxious reply our enemies
are not stupid you know they may have a trick or
two up their sleeves i have not thought of but i
guess we are all right

  but where are we going philip asked mona
there is an island of volcanic origin off the west
coast of africa which has never been inhabited or even
named but it is habitable and rich in natural re-
sources this island appeared above the surface of
the ocean only about ten years before the great war
and has never been exploited i have visited it and
found it a fine place from there we shall conduct
the long-range activities that are to save our country
and our compatriots

  it is way over my head complained tom but
evidently you know what you are talking about ill
not be surprised at anything after what you told us
mona barton looked thoughtfully at her husband
his fine aristocratic features were fixed in the expres-
sion of forced despondency they had all adopted for
the benefit of the detectoscope watchers but she made
out a twinkle in his eye which could not quite be con-
trolled

  just about time for the fireworks he announced
we are about half way between savannah and ber-
muda and i guess this is about as good a place as any
to go to davy jones locker remember the play-acting
now

  with a barely perceptible movement of his hand he
pressed the hidden button and there was a muffled rum-
bling report from the engine room below

  his companions feigned violent starts of surprise
and jack sterns rose to the occasion nobly by rushing
to the engine room and opening the door sufficiently to
allow a cloud of dense white smoke to issue from it
into the corridor he returned to the navigating cabin


amazing stories

and with gestures of excitement told of his findings
mona wrung her hands at the news and found some
little difficulty in maintaining her expression of fear and
hopelessness she wanted rather to laugh

  philip simulated the frantic manipulation of controls
of a pilot who suddenly found his power fail and his
vessel out of control actually he was adjusting the
speed and angle of descent to provide for a safe dive
into the dark waters that quickly loomed close the
descent seemed sickeningly rapid and the angle of the
vessel was so steep that the passengers in the navigating
cabin found difficulty in maintaining their positions it
was not necessary for the others to act their parts now
for they were actually frightened at the swiftness with
which the ocean rushed to meet them closer and closer
they drew to the tumbling surface and with a shock
that threw them into a heap against the forward wall
of the cabin the inquisitor pitched nose foremost into
the deep

the inquisitor disappears

before the screen of a detectoscope in one of
the offices of the secret service in washington
sat randall haines and two of his subordinate
officers the view on the screen was that of the in-
terior of the navigating cabin of the inquisitor one
of the officers kept his fingers on the focus and magni-
fication controls of the instrument to maintain a clear
image as the distance to the speeding vessel gradually
increased

  none of them have left the navigating cabin said
one of the watchers and they dont appear as wor-
ried as one would expect under the circumstances
oh sneered haines barton is a cool one olsen
he has probably told the others he would fix everything
so they need not fear anything unpleasant but he
little knows what is waiting for them at biscoe island
but at that moment the passengers of the inquisitor
betrayed astonishment and fear in the countenances pic-
tured so faithfully in the detectoscope screen

  by george somethings happened exclaimed
haines as they watched jack sterns rush from the
navigating cabin in obvious excitement

  olsen speedily readjusted the penetrating and focus-
ing controls of the instrument and they followed
sterns movements as he hastened to the engine room
and opened the door haines shouted his glee as a
cloud of dense white smoke issued from the door and
sterns slammed it shut and ran to the navigating cabin
with the news the penetrating ray of the instrument
was directed into the heart of the engine room but all
that could be seen was dim outlines of die machinery
around which there swirled the heavy clouds of smoke
it was quite apparent that an explosion had occurred
and when a view of the navigating cabin was again re-
turned to the screen the expressions on the passengers
faces gave unmistakable evidence of their knowledge
of the seriousness of the situation haines chuckled
gloatingly as philip barton struggled frantically with
the controls

  bartons end comes even sooner than we expected
he chortled the inquisitor is falling already lets
watch it from the exterior olsen

  with further manipulation of the detectoscope con-
trols and the shutting off of the penetrating energy

a view of the tumbling waters of the atlantic was ob-
tained and the inquisitor could be seen to careen
violently and plunge nose down toward the heaving
surface swifter and swifter it fell descending rapidly
at an angle of about forty-five degrees then suddenly
it was all over the nose of the vessel entered the
waves with a great cleaving effect throwing a shimmer-
ing spray in every direction as the smooth hull buried
its length from sight the splash returned to the sur-
face like that following a stone tossed into a puddle
and the waters closed over the vanished air yacht

  randall haines laughed aloud saves a lot of work
for the department he said we should have been
busy watching them for all of a year had this not hap-
pened i must report it at once

  better wait a bit sir admonished olsen the
vessel will return to the surface unless the hull was
battered in by the force of its dive

the searching ray of the detectoscope played over
the surface of the ocean for more than a half hour
in the vicinity of the accident olsen even tried the
penetrating ray but it was of no avail since the variable
refractive effect of the tumbling waves broke up the
screen images completely a further methodic search
of the surface for several miles in all directions from
the point where the inquisitor had vanished produced
no results

  then haines gave vent to a startled exclamation
whats that olsen  he asked in excitement pointing
to a small object that bobbed about on the surface of
the dark waters

  the magnification was increased rapidly until the
object became life-sized on the screen it was a small
wooden packing case and in black letters on its cover
was the name inquisitor there was no further
doubt of the loss of the vessel and its passengers

  randall haines could contain himself no longer and
he hastened to the television radio in the adjoining
room after a moment of setting a number-combina-
tion on a series of dials on the instrument the heavy
features of jerome carter appeared in a brightly illu-
minated square on its face

  hello haines greeted the unpleasant voice
whats the news

  theyve been sunk was the reply

  sunk asked carter in startled voice what do
you mean

  there was an explosion in the engine room of the
inquisitor and she went down out of control she
dove into the ocean as nicely as one of those performers
at the century this week and never came up

  carters ruddy features purpled he seemed about
to burst by god haines he ejaculated if you
did this ill have you reduced to the gray

  i didnt sir i didnt palpitated the now fright-
ened haines olsen and anthony will bear me out
it was pure accident something we didnt count on
id think you would be pleased

  pleased pleased sputtered carter why man
dont you realize this will set the gray multitude into
seething uproar philip barton is their idol and we
went the absolute limit in arranging for his exile even
as it is there has been difficulty in keeping them in
hand now nothing on earth can convince them that
the accident was not of our contriving the govern-
bartons island



ment will be branded as bartons murderer and the
workers may do almost anything in their excitement

  then the newscasting corporation must be kept
ignorant of this development said haines with an
inspiration

  yes that might be successful replied carter
thoughtfully but it will be necessary to invent news of
their movements for many months to keep the workers
from suspecting



t ut randall haines had reckoned without his sub-
ordinates for not having orders to the contrary
olsen had already reported the eventful happening
to the newscasting corporation and while haines still
conversed with jerome carter the news-speakers were
spreading the information throughout the continent

  through the lower levels of the great cities it spread
like wildfire and gray-clad workers paused in their
tasks to send up prayers for the souls of philip barton
and his wife and companions here and there they
exchanged furtive glances and passed signs that boded
ill for the plutocracy of the upper levels

  within the hour there was rioting in new york and
in several others of the large centers but it was quickly
subdued by violent action of the red guards for the
pitiable multitude in gray was without an organization
without a leader of sufficient ability to unite them in the
emergency

  president haven bore the brunt of recrimination
heaped on the government by the workers and by cer-
tain of those of the purple who were friends and ad-
mirers of philip barton he was openly accused of the
murder of his own daughter and when he attempted
to address a crowd that had gathered in capitol square
in washington he was hissed down after this ex-
perience he retired to his own chambers under heavy
guard but in the innermost recesses of his thoughts
he was glad he did not believe that his daughter was
lost nor that her husband and his companions had been
drowned in the cold waters of the atlantic he trusted
philip barton and to himself he repeated over and
over again the assurance he had been given by the in-
ventor that a reported disaster would be a ruse and was
not to be credited but his position was extremely
difficult and he called on carter for assistance and ad-
vice but that wily person had eliminated himself as
completely as if he had vanished from the face of the
earth it was impossible to locate him by radio at any
of his offices or at his living quarters with trouble
brewing he had left the president to face it alone the
secret council of ten had likewise become non-existent
as far as any possibility of locating them was con-
cerned but the secret service was loyal to its duties
and president haven felt certain of his safety from
personal violence when he reached his own rooms es-
corted and guarded by nine members of the depart-
ment

  tnknown to the wearers of the purple there
 were three gathering places of the gray the
largest in new york city was cleverly hidden in a dis-
used warehouse space below one of the deepest sub-
levels this space was of sufficient size to permit more
than two thousand workers to listen to the exhortations
of the few speakers who had the temerity to address

them from time to time another was located in
chicago this one being fully as large as the first a
third somewhat smaller had been recently established
in san francisco the three headquarters were inter-
connected by a secret television-radio public address
system and the growing organization activities which
had been interruptd by bartons exile could thus be
carried on without knowledge of the red police or of
the world at large

  less than five hours after the reported loss of philip
bartons vessel these three halls were crowded to the
utmost and a red-faced individual addressed the three
audiences from the platform of the meeting place in
new york he was arnold baxter a close friend of
kirk paulson and he spoke vigorously and pointedly

  friends he said we must not deceive ourselves in
this matter of the exiling of philip barton we must
not place the blame upon the shoulders of his father-
in-law president haven though he signed the decree
of banishment it has become increasingly evident dur-
ing recent years that there is a guiding hand a dictator
of the policies of our government and that dictator
is none other than jerome carter we may rest as-
sured that it was by his influence this dastardly action
was taken and to me it is clearly evident that the
persuasion of our president to sign the fatal paper
was accomplished only by a clever presentment of the
banishment decree as something that could not possibly
result in harm to his daughter or to her husband but
this vicious arch-enemy of ours carter had planned
cleverly that the voyage of the inquisitor was to pro-
vide a simple and completely masked means of getting
barton out of the way forever he has accomplished
his purpose to our everlasting loss and sorrow our
dear friend now lies at the bottom of the atlantic and
his great work must be continued by another kirk
paulson is the only man in united north america
who can measure up to the necessity is kirk here

  there was no response for a few minutes then a
piping voice spoke up from the rear of the auditorium
there was a group in cooper square at noon time
kirk was among them but they were dispersed by the
red guards and he has not been seen since my sister
was in the group and we have heard nothing from her
either

  another example of this unbearable tyranny
shouted arnold baxter they have undoubtedly been
incarcerated by the red police but we must not delay
for long philip barton must be avenged and oh
friends if you but realized it our power is more than
sufficient to accomplish the overthrow of the present
regime and the establishment of a new order of things
-government actually of the people by the people
and for the people our number is legion and but
for the fact that we are unorganized we could this
minute take things in our own hands true we have
been kept uneducated and undernourished we have
been divided and sequestered to prevent this very or-
ganizing and why because we are feared by those
of the purple full well do they appreciate the strength
we could muster were we properly led and banded to-
gether and that is the very reason for jerome carters
fear of barton who befriended us well but a bit too
openly

  the republican form of government is sound in
principle and i do not believe that any of us are in


amazing stories

favor of a substitute but our actual government is no
longer a republic the control has gradually passed
from the hands of the people where it belongs by con-
stitutional right to the hands of a few men who have
amassed huge fortunes by inheritance supplemented
by profiteering in the labor of our down-trodden mil-
lions these have subsidized the politicians and have
controlled the elections for decades they have forced
the passage of laws which benefit their own class and
disciminate against ours this class legislation has
poisoned our entire social structure until during the
past two generations we have degenerated into the suf-
fering hopeless lot we now are

  but an end must come to everything and this last
act of carters is the final blow that must precipitate
action unfit as i am to plan and direct our activities
i must endeavor to get things started in the absence of
kirk paulson he is our logical leader and is by far
the most capable among us now that philip barton is
gone but we must not delay i have a plan for initial
action that i had already discussed with kirk and we
must put it into effect at once in fact it is my belief
we should take even more serious action than the mere
organizing proposed

  pandemonium reigned in the hall cheers rent the
air and the listeners gave vent to their enthusiasm as
they had not dared for many years

  the plan the plan demanded many voices when
a semblance of order was restored

	   

while arnold baxter was expounding the plan
perfecting a powerful organization of the
workers jerome carter and his secret council of ten
were gathered together in a chamber of the administra-
tion building in washington ruthless determination
was written on his hard features as he addressed the
ten men who with himself controlled ninety-two per
cent of the wealth of united north america

  gentlemen he said the gist of the matter is this
war has been declared by this action of ours in getting
rid of barton unwittingly we have rid ourselves of
him too suddenly and effectively the workers will
rise against us-if we allow them to already there
are rumblings from below in many of our cities the
unrest will spread rapidly-unless we prevent it and
we must prevent it there is no time to be lost

  true but how are we to prevent it asked
emory cass president of the great newscasting cor-
poration of north america

  rhusenic angina whispered carter hoarsely

  the council was struck speechless by the words and
by the implication of carters voice and sinister smile
for the dread and almost certainly fatal heart affection
caused by the absorption into the system of rhusene
an extremely powerful explosive had been one of the
most terrible causes of mortality during the latter days
of the great war

  we couldnt gasped emory cass

  we must replied carter firmly he turned to
another member of the council alexander dewolf
president of the united north american water supply
syndicate and its up to you alec he stated

  dewolfe paled and he stammered an objection
but-but-carter-thats murder he said

its self-defense replied carter are we to sit

idly by and permit the rabble to repeat the horrors of
communistic asia are we to be murdered in our
beds by a horde of uncouth maddened brutes no
my dear alec its murder prevention and i think you
will not object to my plan

  what is the plan asked dewolf submissively
its more than a plan said carter its an order
in twelve of the largest cities one hundred thousand
workers will be infected with rhusene to-morrow morn-
ing when they swallow their first drink of water you
will see to it that in each of the first twelve cities of the
land sufficient quantities of the compound is intro-
duced into reservoirs feeding the proper number of
sections of the lower levels to account for that number
one hundred thousand in each of twelve cities
breathed dewolf why that is one million two hun-
dred thousand people

  precisely agreed carter and that may prove to
be an ample number if not well take further action
the meeting is dismissed

  the members of the secret council filed from the
room in silence and without looking at one another

in the presidents home

when the inquisitor struck the heaving waters
of the ocean it was with considerably more force
than philip intended the occupants of the navi-
gating cabin were severely shaken up and bruised philip
himself receiving a blow on the forehead from sudden
contact with the instrument board which blow nearly
rendered him unconscious so dazed was he by the
impact that it was several minutes before he recovered
sufficiently to remember the necessary changes in the
adjustments of the controls to adapt the vessel to move-
ment in the denser medium they had entered full
gravity had been restored just before the dive and he
had pulled the lever which opened the sea-cocks and
admitted water to the ballast compartments it was
thus that he came to the realization that they were
diving rapidly toward the bottom of the ocean and the
depth indicator registered over one thousand feet when
he came fully to his senses the ballast tanks were
filling rapidly and his first action was to close the sea-
cocks first in the bow and then in the stern compart-
ments to restore the vessel to an even keel

  he then glanced at mona and his male companions
and saw that though considerably upset by the experi-
ence they were alive and not much injured he
smiled encouragingly at monas questioning glance and
then turned full energy into the stern reaction motors
the pumps were at work emptying much of the water
they had taken aboard and it was not long before they
had risen to a depth of about a hundred feet below the
surface and were headed southward at full speed in
the denser medium the inquisitors speed was greatly
reduced and it required full energy from the emergency
power plant to drive them at two miles a minute

  the great searchlights were turned on and these
illuminated the water for nearly a quarter of a mile
ahead philip gazed anxiously into the green opales-
cence for he had not previously driven the vessel at so
considerable a speed through the comparatively un-
known element his charts showed depths of two
thousand feet and more throughout the course he was
following but he was nervously apprehensive of un-
bartons island



 a view of the tumbling
waters of the atlantic was
obtained and the inquisitor
could be seen to careen
violently and plunge nose
down toward the heaving
surface

swifter and swifter
it fell descending
rapidly at an angle
of about forty-five
degrees

known shoals for the soundings had been made more
than a century previously before ocean travel with
floating or sub-surface vessels had been abandoned for
the simpler and cheaper air travel

  he instructed jack and tom in the matter of sending
an empty packing case through the air lock to deceive
the watchers in washington he also requested them
to release kirk paulson and his companions from their
hiding place and these soon crowded into the navi-
gating cabin exhibiting many bruises and considerable
concern over the cause of the shock which had thrown
them into scrambling heaps in the chamber they had
occupied their surprise and relief on learning the
true state of affairs was electric and the atmosphere
of the cabin soon became one of rejoicing and exulta-
tion

 for two hours the inquisitor held her speed and
course and then with a sigh of relief philip turned her
nose upward and prepared to take the ship once more
into the element for which she was primarily designed
the vessel was soon bobbing about on the surface and
philip scanned the heavens carefully for signs of any
transatlantic vessel which might discover and report
them but the skies were clear and he started the gravi-

tonic field generators at once the dripping hull of the
ship rose eagerly to the controls and they soon resumed
the normal air-cruising level of twenty thousand feet

  now jack he said when the course had been
changed to the southeast and the speed increased to
five hundred miles an hour i wish you would take
the controls for a time i want to get some of my
instruments working and see what is happening back
home

  this arrangement being made he greeted kirks fol-
lowers and mutual introductions followed after which
mona took the women in charge and tom the men all
being assigned to staterooms in the vessel which was to
be their home for some time to come

  he retired to one of the secret chambers with kirk
paulson and the two men were soon busily engaged
with a detectoscope which was one of the portions of
the equipment of the hidden compartment a series of
sliding panels in the neutroloy wall was opened to
permit the directing of the rays of the instrument in
a northwesterly direction without interference the
city of washington was soon brought into view on
the rectangular screen and philip immediately found the
administration building with the searching ray with


amazing stories

the penetrating ray in service he quickly obtained ac-
cess to the presidents private office where he found
two secretaries at work but president haven was
not there he observed that the secretaries were con-
versing occasionally in jerky half-frightened mono-
syllables and he hastened to bring into service one of
his most recent inventions the detectophone his
model was the only instrument of its kind in existence
and was capable of picking up the speech of those far-
away assistants in the administration building and
bringing their words to the inquisitor over the rays
projected from the standard detectoscope

  haven didnt take it as seriously as i expected
spoke one of the men visible on the screen

  no replied the other that occurred to me also
  but carters scared

  yes

  they say he cant be located

  so i heard

  wheres haven

  home i guess

philip had heard all he wished and he soon adjusted
the searching ray to reach for the location of the
presidents living quarters these were quickly pene-
trated and he found ross haven in his own spacious
drawing room with mrs haven and frances the
youngest daughter the detectophone was still in oper-
ation and the voices of the three came clearly to philip
and kirk

  blit daddy are you sure asked frances wiping
her eyes with a corner of her handkerchief

  i trust philip was the reply he told me defi-
nitely that he planned to make it appear that they were
lost and assured me that any news to that effect would
be untrue

  oh i do hope you are right spoke mrs haven
in a tone of extreme anxiety if anything has really
happened to mona it will be the death of me

  dont worry now mother spoke the president
patting her shoulder comfortingly philip would not
have made the statements he did unless they were
true

  kirk looked at his superior hadnt we better set
their minds at rest he asked

  yes i think we had replied philip but with the
ship in motion we can project only our voices that
should be enough though get mona here

  sure agreed kirk starting at once to locate her
philip busied himself with another contrivance that
occupied a space on the long bench adjoining the de-
tectoscope and the detectophone this invention had
also not been disclosed to the world though philip had
perfected it more than a year previously it was the
projectophone which by a simple connection to the de-
tectophone and utilizing the searching and penetrating
rays of the standard detectoscope enabled one to carry
on a two-way conversation with persons pictured on
the screen

  mona returned with kirk just as he had completed
the necessary connections and when she saw her
parents and sister pictured before her eyes and heard
their familiar voices in worried conversation she
uttered an exclamation of surprise and joy

  what was that asked her mother in a startled
voice i thought i heard mona speak

  you did mother you did mona exclaimed i
am safe on the inquisitor and can see you and hear you
thanks to one of philips secret inventions

  but-but stammered her mother looking about
in a confused manner i hear you perfectly but i
can not see you and your voice seems to come from
nowhere it is everywhere in the room

  philip laughed aloud it must seem mysterious at
that mrs haven he said but it is an accomplished
fact nevertheless and we are all safe just as mona
says

  the president spoke what actually happened
he asked

  i drove the inquisitor under water replied philip
after making it appear that an engine room explosion
had damaged the vessel beyond repair we traveled
below the surface for two hours but are now in the
air and headed toward an almost unknown island under
our own emergency power

  mrs haven cried her relief on her husbands shoul-
der as she heard the distant voice and frances was so
excited that she could not wait to talk with her beloved
sister the two-way conversation was carried on for
some time and philip betrayed great concern when he
learned of the effect the report of his death had pro-
duced among the masses in the lower levels of the cities

  they must not start trouble now he said or they
will upset all my plans i must increase speed and
get to our destination at once so our further work can
be started so farewell for a time folks well get in
touch with you often

it was thus a happy-faced group that faded from the
screen when barton changed the adjustments to
search for jerome carter he was unable to locate the
dictator either in his new york or washington office
or in his home so he returned to the navigating cabin
and took over the controls from jack sterns

  we must rush to our destination he announced
trouble is brewing fast at home and there are certain
things i can do only from a headquarters on solid
ground

  how much further is it asked kirk

  about four thousand miles air line our island
is not far from st helena where the emperor na-
poleon spent six years in exile more than four cen-
turies ago

  then were bound for a stylish neighborhood for
exiles laughed tom easton

  yes said philip and i want to get there in two
hours

  can you do it asked jack in surprise

  i think so were going up about twenty miles
further where there is practically no air resistance of
course the rotation of the earth is against us if our
height makes us independent of it since it travels from
west to east at the surface speed of nearly a thousand
miles an hour but we are cutting across the plane of
the equator at an angle of about forty-five degrees so
the adverse effect can be only half of that speed and
i think the inquisitor can do  miles an hour at the
higher altitude

  the altimeter already showed eighty thousand feet
and was still mounting the speed indicator soon
showed nearly fifty miles a minute so there was little
doubt of accomplishing philips desire
bartons island



darkness had long since been overtaken when
philip slowed down the vessel and maneuvered
to a lower altitude by his dead reckoning they had
about reached their goal and he sent jack to the plat-
form on the upper surface of the ship to take observa-
tions while jack was aloft philip bent over his chart
and pointed out the position of the island longitude
twelve degrees and twenty minutes west latitude
twenty-one degrees and two minutes south in a
few minutes jack returned with the sextant and his ob-
servation checked the dead reckoning almost exactly
they had reached the island

  all was in darkness beneath save for the light of the
moon as it shimmered on the tumbling waters slowly
the inquisitor was dropped to two thousand feet alti-
tude and the searchlights were directed downwards
the searching pencils of white radiance soon located
a rugged coast line where foaming white breakers
dashed rhythmically against rocky cliffs that reared
their tops safely out of reach it was less than two
miles ahead and in a very few minutes the inquisitor
had been maneuvered to a landing in a clear space well
back from the rocky shore

  philip mustered all hands hitherto hidden in one of
the secret compartments as soon as the landing was
made and they set to work with a will as he directed
them to convey to the outside the sections of a knocked-
down structural tower and several cases of apparatus
and parts which were required in the experiments to
follow the light metal sections were rapidly assem-
bled in the flat open space alongside the vessel great
flood-lights being brought into play to light the scene
as brightly as day -within the hour a cage-like struc-
ture reared itself skyward to a height of more than
seventy feet and philip and kirk erected a pivoted
horizontal member at the top which was assembled
from short joints of shining metallic tubing to form
a cannon-like tube of some twenty feet in length a
small electric motor was attached to gearing that swung
this member about its vertical axis and a similar motor
applied to the horizontal axis so that the tube could
be swung to any point of the compass by remote con-
trol or to any angle with relation to the horizontal in-
sulated cables were brought down the lattice-work of
the tower and carried into the inquisitor where they
were attached to a mechanism in the laboratory com-
partment

  now said philip when the work was completed to
his satisfaction we are ready for some serious work
and i do not believe we are much too soon

  he first brought the detectoscope and its allied in-
struments into action the first search carried the ob-
servers to the extreme lower levels of new york city
where it foscused on the meeting being addressed by
arnold baxter kirk paulson expressed his glee at
the size of the gathering but his face took on a serious
expression when the first words of the speaker were
made audible by the detectophone

  and friends intoned the voice of arnold baxter
we must strike our first blow to-morrow morning and
it shall be a decisive blow that will show our power in
no uncertain manner paulson is not here-philip
barton lies in a watery grave-but we must act jerome
carter and the council of ten must go much as we
all hate the thought of bloodshed there is no other way
i have the living addresses of all eleven and these must

be visited before dawn and each must pay the penalty
with his life we have weapons and we have brave
souls to use them philip barton must be avenged and
our once glorious country must be restored to its birth-
right of freedom and happiness who will volun-
teer 

  there was a storm of cheers from the crowd in the
auditorium and from the loud speakers connected with
the chicago and san francisco meetings came clearly
the clamorous approval of the gatherings assembled
at those points

  kirks face paled great scott philip he ex-
claimed they are mad it means a bloody civil war
if they are not stopped

  just what i feared agreed philip and we must
stop them

  he energized the projectophone mechanism and
brought the image of arnold baxter very close in the
screen all members of the party on board the vessel
were assembled in the laboratory and they watched
and listened to the proceedings in breathless silence

  speak quietly to baxter now kirk directed philip

  kirk placed his lips to the microphone and whis-
pered baxter

  the leader of the gray assemblage was panting from
the excitement and exertion of his speech but he turned
his head sharply at sound of the voice that whispered
in his ear from nowhere

   baxter repeated kirk it is i kirk paulson

  in great surprise arnold baxter swung about in all
directions as if expecting his friend to materialize from
the surrounding air

  in heavens name man where are you he asked

  oh about five thousand miles away said kirk
with philip barton who does not as is supposed lie
in a watery grave you must stop this terrible thing
you have started

  but how-how- sputtered baxter

  never mind how i am communicating with you it
takes too long to explain but it is by means of an in-
vention of bartons i see you and the assembly through
an ordinary detectoscope and i also see that you have
no less than fifty volunteers for the bloody work you
have proposed tell them we are safe-tell the entire
audience and then let me speak to them

baxter pounded for order and in a few well-
chosen words told them the news expressions of
disbelief surged through the crowd and it was some
little time before the clamor was silenced then the well-
known voice of kirk paulson swept through the hall
and the astounded listeners were compelled to believe

  friends said kirk this mad plan must be aban-
doned philip barton is alive and he plans a scientific
method of controlling the situation in united north
america the fact that he was not killed in the re-
ported accident to the inquisitor must be kept in abso-
lute secrecy for a time and i charge you all not to be-
tray the trust to prove the truth of my statements
philip barton will now speak to you and through the
medium of one of his most remarkable recent in-
ventions an image of him and of myself will be pro-
jected upon this platform we are not ghosts and the
images will be merely light images having three normal
dimensions even after their projection through inter-
vening space


amazing stories

  the far-away audience watched the platform and
listened in strained silence while philip worked rapidly
to get the apparatus of his projectoscope in operation
in the laboratory of the inquisitor the witnesses
watched as closely as did their friends in distant new
york philip and kirk mounted a small insulated plat-
form over which was suspended a huge helix of glit-
tering copper ribbon that glowed with a mysterious
purple light when a generator started purring in a cor-
ner of the laboratory and numerous vacuum tubes in
a wall cabinet lighted up at the touch of philips finger
to a switch two small levers operating on semi-cir-
ular plates graduated in degrees were manipulated to
control the direction of the tube at the top of the tower
that had been erected outside the vessel philip moved
these levers carefully until a circular spot of reddish
light appeared on the platform of the distant audi-
torium then he spoke

  friends came his kindly voice if you will keep
your eyes on the spot of light which has appeared be-
fore arnold baxter you will observe the gradual ma-
terialization of my image and that of kirk paulson
now

  he pressed a button at the side of one of the levers
and the hum of the generator lowered in pitch as it
took the increased load the watchers at both ends of
the circuit gasped as the living images appeared on that
platform-hazy at first and weaving about from static
interference they soon developed into clear-cut sub-

stantial reproductions of the two men on the little trans-
mitting table in the inquisitors laboratory

  the crowd in the distant meeting hall broke loose
and nothing could restrain their demonstrations for
nearly ten minutes finally becoming impatient at
the delay philip silenced them with a thundering voice
and told them of the importance of their deserting the
plan proposed by baxter and of their remaining in-
active to permit him to carry out his own plans in their
behalf he spoke to them for about fifteen minutes
and made arrangements to speak at the same point each
evening thereafter until his activities had brought re-
sults when the projectoscope was switched off and
the images of the two men vanished the din in the hall
was terrific and kirk paulson gloated over the success
of the experiment while philip changed the adjustments
and started a search for jerome carter

  we may rest assured that he is up to some deviltry
by this time he said grimly as he searched first the
offices and then the living quarters of the great man

  it finally occurred to him to search the administration
building and there after several ineffectual attempts
he eventually located the secret meeting room where
carter was in session with his ten lieutenants the
first words heard from that point were the instructions
to alexander dewolf regarding the pollution of the
water supply and the witnesses on board the inquisitor
paled and gasped their horror at the fiendishness of the
plot

  great scott exclaimed barton when carters
bartons island



meeting was dismissed the man is a far worse rascal
than i suspected we are none too soon

he directed kirk to follow the movements of de-
wolf with the detectoscope and set about bring-
ing to the projectoscope platform a crystal sphere of
about eighteen inches diameter this he placed in a
cup-shaped receptacle which he set in the center of
the platform then he returned to the adjusting mech-
anism of the searching ray

  on the screen they followed dewolf to the fast air
liner that carried him from washington to new york
in less than fifty minutes they followed him to his
very rooms where he was seen to sit before his desk
and start writing orders to twelve trusted subordinates
in the twelve great cities named by carter these were
written on radiogram blanks and were intended to be
delivered in the morning

  time to take serious action said philip

  he started the projectoscope generator and the crys-
tal sphere glowed with an unholy wavering radiance
that shifted color so rapidly as to set the eyes pulsating
with immediate nervous reactions

  keep your eyes off that sphere folks he ordered
the controls of of the projectoscope were adjusted
until a red circle of light appeared on alexander
dewolfs desk then an image of the shimmering
sphere itself materialized in that spot and dewolf
sprang back in alarm but his eyes could not leave that
awe-inspiring phenomenon he seemed drawn to it by
some irresistible force and the watchers saw his eyes
dilate in fear as the pupils jerked spasmodically in
rhythm with the flickering colors in less than two
minutes he stiffened in his chair to the rigidity of a
stone image eyes wide open and staring

  those messages will not go out to-night laughed
philip that was a successful demonstration of long-
distance hypnotism mr dewolf will not awaken
until we use our projectoscope on him again-when
advisable now lets all get some sleep

  it was an astonished and awed group that broke up
a few minutes later and retired to the staterooms of the
inquisitor

exploring the island

next morning philip awakened with the dawn
and he prepared to sally forth at once to look
over their surroundings in daylight being care-
ful not to awaken mona as he bathed and dressed

  he found that kirk had preceded him and was ex-
amining the results of their previous nights work on
the projectoscope tower it evidently pleased him in
spite of the haste with which it had been accomplished
for he greeted philip with a broad smile

  good morning philip said kirk are you ready
for a check on our friends back home to see what they
may be up to in the early morning hours

  not for some time yet kirk was the reply you
forget that the sun rises here about four and a half
hours earlier than in washington our friends of the
purple are not accustomed to rising before dawn
thats right admitted kirk and i imagine some
of our companions here will not be up and about for an
hour or more either

  quite likely laughed philip at least im sure
that mona will not she was exhausted when we re-

tired last night in the meantime suppose you and i
look over the island a bit it is three years since i last
visited it and i should like to see what changes if any
have taken place in that time

  they made their way over the smooth moss-covered
rocks of the extensive plateau on which the inquisitor
rested and soon neared the edge of the cliff which sep-
arated them from the remainder of the island there a
wonderful sight met their view for before them spread
a huge depression all that remained of the crater of the
extinct volcano whose dying activity had thrust the
island above the surface of the waves the sloping
walls of the crater were covered with strange vegeta-
tion tropical in character yet lacking in the hugeness
and denseness of the jungles of africa on account of
the comparative youth of the undeveloped island birds
of brilliant hue flitted among the trees and the air was
redolent of the odors of virgin forest from the oppo-
site side of the crater fully two miles across there cas-
caded a waterfall that spilled its sparkling waters down
the sloping wall of rock and formed a stream that
wound its way through the verdant valley and disap-
peared among the trees in the lowermost portion of the
depression the skies were cloudless and the early
morning sun already gave promise of a much warmer
day than the one they were accustomed to in the uni-
formly cooled and heated cities of their own country

  this is back to nature with a vengeance laughed
kirk i have not visited the country in more than ten
years and have seen no growing things since except-
ing potted plants and flowers lets go down into the
valley i see a natural pathway down the rocks that
should not be difficult to follow

  better not said philip we have many things to
accomplish to-day and we might spend several hours
down there if we ventured into the valley i lost my-
self in that undergrowth three years ago and spent
nearly a full day finding my way out

as they became absorbed in their contemplation of
the beauties of nature there was another of the
inquisitors passengers who had been awakened by the
early morning sun and who was busily preparing to
leave the vessel on a mission of curiosity this was
one of kirks friends aline sarov an attractive titian-
haired miss of twenty who had spent the past eight
years of her life in the confining work of the synthetic
food products corporation never in her short and
uneventful experience had she been awakened by the
cheerful inpouring of the suns rays through a bedside
window her every awakening as far back as mem-
ory carried her had been to the automatic flooding of
her small eight-level room with artificial sunlight sup-
plied over the cables of the manhattan power division
at precisely six oclock and the real sun which she
had seen but four times in her lifetime was so much
more comforting and pleasant she reveled in the
warmth of the beam that slanted across her room then
with a sudden accession of exuberant vigor rushed
through the corridors of the inquisitor and out into the
open aiiv

  when she reached the outside she breathed deep of
the ocean breeze and could scarce refrain from shout-
ing her happiness aloud with quick light steps she
made her way across the rocks and soon reached the
craters rim where the unexpected sight of its sud-
 

amazing stories

denly revealed beauties struck her with such force that
she stood rooted to the spot for many silent minutes
so absorbed was she in the strangely marvelous view
that she did not see the two men who stood not a hun-
dred feet away watching her with pleased and kindly
understanding

  finally kirk called out aline

  with a startled glance in their direction the girl
flushed and seemed about to return in haste to the
inquisitor

come called kirk again come and join us
all right she replied her momentary embarrass-
ment forgotten i thought i was the only early riser
on the yacht so i was a bit surprised by your greeting
she approached the two men somewhat timidly
good morning she greeted them when she reached
the spot where they awaited her coming

  good morning returned the two men

  and philips keen gray eyes noted the softness of the
words as spoken by kirk and the mounting color of the
girl as she took the hand of the handsome young man
in gray sensing the situation at once he soon made an
excuse and returned to the inquisitor leaving the two
younger people together

  you look wonderful this morning aline was
kirks first remark after philip was out of sight

do i  she replied innocently it must be the in-
vigorating sea air that brings the color to my cheeks
no it is more than that aline you look happy
and carefree it is the freedom from the dull mo-
notony of the daily grind

  perhaps you are right kirk she agreed solemnly
i do feel different i feel as though i were an indi-
vidual rather than a mere cog in a great machine-a
great purposeless machine and what is it all about
kirk you have promised to explain it all to me and
i am so ignorant and so anxious to learn why are our
lives as they are 

  kirk looked tenderly at the sweet face which had
once more taken on its customary wistful expression
it is a long story he said

  but we have plenty of time she said please tell
me-kirk

  very well he agreed ill do my best

  side by side they sat at the rim of the crater and
kirk unfolded to her eager ears the story of the de-
velopment of conditions as they had come to exist in
united north america

  the trouble has not become acute until recent
years he began in fact it did not begin to assume
serious proportions until after the great war but it
actually began in the dim past-about three centuries
ago at that time the united states of america was the
richest nation in the world even as united north
america is at the present time the world was then
recovering from a rather widespread conflict in which
most of the nations had become involved but of course
the effects were as nothing when compared with those
of the great war of  to  the foreign nations
recovered with comparative rapidity and in less than
twenty years the war that had then been considered so
dreadful became little more than a memory

 lveanwhile the wealth of our country con-
tinued and the prosperity of the lower and mid-
dle class grew apace in those days there were three

classes the middle one of which has since disappeared
this was in the early days of industrial development
and what were known as public utilities enjoyed an
unprecedented growth the use of electricity was in
its infancy but growing rapidly and it was not long
before the public utilities became the strongest single
factor in the old united states serving the public
in the matter of light heat power and transportation
they were given monopolistic rights by the people it
being a foregone conclusion that the people would be
served there lay the great danger the danger of the
essentials of life falling into the hands of a unified in-
terest and the public utilities saw to it that unifica-
tion was accomplished the monopoly created by the
public eventually came to prey on the public which
created it

  the utilities formed huge combinations aided and
abetted by the gullible public and these undertook to
control the politics of the people who created them and
to dictate the policies of the government the pros-
perity of the middle class contributed surely and in-
evitably to the accomplishment of the result for they
soon became of sufficient affluence to dabble in what
was known as the stock market in new york and in
other large cities there were trading places where se-
curities and papers representing actual shares in various
business enterprises were dealt in but these trading
centers were actually controlled by the moneyed inter-
ests though for a time they allowed the middle and
lower classes to profit and to approach though scarcely
ever reach the independence of wealth

  it was all a clever scheme in the minds of a few
great financial wizards you see the period of intense
public interest in speculation continued for many years
and the combinations and mergers of great industrial
and public utility interests increased by leaps and
bounds executives and officials of the great corpora-
tions formed investment trusts wherein they pooled
their vast holdings of the stocks of varied corporations
with the intention of preventing the collapse of prices
and still enabling the individuals to cash in on their
paper profits the public continued to buy and buy
and in order to gratify their anxiety to amass riches
for themselves their savings were withdrawn from the
banks in ever-increasing amounts and eventually found
their way into the coffers of the unified industries and
utilities  the collapse of the banking system followed

  then came the collapse of the stock market and the
poor misguided public saw their paper profits dwindle
and disappear under the onslaughts of the professional
manipulators of the market after their supposed profits
had gone their actual savings followed and within a
very short time the middle and lower classes were
without funds and the upper class was in possession of
almost all of the tangible wealth of the nation the
crushing of the national banks and the federal reserve
was not so easy as this could not be accomplished with-
out legislation but this proved to be no great stum-
bling block to the great financial minds for they had by
this time become so very powerful and influential that
they were enabled to force through congress almost
any legislation they desired

gold had been used for many years as a basis for
the monetary system this also was done away with
when the banking system was disrupted further
legislation was enacted and the government mints were

closed down the coining of gold silver nickel and
copper being discontinued the paper money of the
government which had previously been issued against
reserves of gold and silver went the way of the bank
notes which had lost their value with the collapse of
the banking system and the country came into the com-
plete control of the industries and utilities their
paper became the medium of exchange and the security
for this paper was the actual plants and properties of
the corporations

tut objected aline the president and the
-- members of congress are elected by the people
if the public saw all of this coming why did they not
prevent it by electing government officials who could
not be influenced nor subsidized by the corporations

  because explained kirk they pulled the wool
over the eyes of the people in those days even as they
have done in our own time but they were devilishly
clever and in their justice be it said that for more than
two centuries conditions under their rule were far
better than they had been previously for a time of
course there was chaos and from it emerged a new
order of things those of the middle class who had
lost their all dropped in status to a class in some cases
lower than the low those few who had managed to
retain some of their profits were elevated to the fringe
of the upper class the middle class as such was gone
and with the re-stabilizing of exchange by the new
system of the industries and utilities the first step of
the great leaders was to alleviate conditions in the
lower classes and to thereby obtain their everlasting
gratitude in the furtherance of their own designs it
was necessary to use the working class and the work-
ing class was made to benefit in direct ratio to its will-
ingness and ability those of education and ability
were quickly elevated to higher stations in life and the
entire level was raised there was less work than ever
for everyone and the standard of living improved until
all were enjoying more of the luxuries and comforts of
life than they had ever known before the advance of
science contributed greatly to this and the invention of
new labor-saving devices and the ultimate complete
electrification of the entire nation lightened the labors
of all of course the few great men at the heads of
the vast corporations were in possession of practically
all of the actual wealth but who cared the actual
machinery of the government was running more
smoothly than ever before each worker found that
his own comforts and rewards could be increased by
increased effort and more especially by improvement
of his or her own education there being little need
for heavy manual labor a premium was placed upon
the possession of knowledge and education and the
entire populace benefitted greatly

  the increase of scientific knowledge led to an age
of invention and this conspired to bring about the con-
centration of population in the great cities and the
abandonment of the farms and smaller communities
necessity called for the provision of synthetic substi-
tutes for farm products and these were forthcoming
the breeding and raising of livestock became almost
impossible on account of the turning of the youth of the
country to the cities synthetic substitutes for meat
were forthcoming with the increase in knowledge of
the requirements of the human body and the knowledge

of the important part played by the various vitamins
this was a simple matter for vitamins can be produced
synthetically as you know from your own work
proper combinations of the required vitamins produced
in palatable form have been our daily sustenance for
two centuries now and statistics show that our race
was until after the great war stronger and healthier
than ever before in its history

  aline corrugated her brow in growing perplexity
if conditions were so ideal for generations and gen-
erations under the new order of things why have they
changed so radically since the great war  she asked

  that is another matter he replied as long as
the men at the head of the eleven essential corpora-
tions were good men and had as their first concern the
good of mankind in general and of their countrymen
in particular all was well but the soft living of those
of the purple gradually altered their viewpoints they
slowly degenerated both mentally and morally brains
were easy to purchase too easy in fact trusted lieu-
tenants took over the more arduous dutift and left
their masters to lives of ease and indulgence and
these lieutenants were placed in positions of power and
authority though their every vital policy was dictated
by the master mind and with the degeneration of the
master minds the policies became less and less favor-
able to the wearers of the gray

  then came the great war the nations of europe
became embroiled in a conflict the like of which had
never been conceived in the minds of the most pessimis-
tic of the calamity howlers their orders for muni-
tions chemicals supplies poured into our country and
their riches followed in payment the master minds
recovered from their lethargy vast profits were to be
made from the misfortunes which had come to europe
the labors of the workers in gray increased apace
china and japan became involved the colonies of
great britain were depopulated to feed the maw of the
monster-super-scientific war-as were the colonies of
the other great powers the wealth of the united
states doubled trebled three billions of our fellow
men had perished and still our people did not interfere
having become a self-contained nation and entirely in-
dependent of imports of commodities it was not neces-
sary to protect ourselves in foreign countries the
entire world was at war-nations were brutally exter-
minating each other by scientific means-whole armies
were wiped out at a single blast of electronic energy
finally when the combatants were exhausted and al-
most defenseless we stepped in with an army of twenty
million it was difficult to determine just which side
we were on but we put an end to the great war-to the
rest of the world almost a second army of twenty
million followed and the job was completed our loss
in man power totaled fifteen millions our loss in riches
was enormous-on paper but we held paper from the
rest of the civilized world that mortgaged its future to
us for a century or more

  then there returned twenty-five millions of young
men and women to our shores they had spent from
one to four years in war-torn europe and asia their
outlook on life was changed they were not content
to return to the gray and it behooved those of the
purple to take action canada had been turned over to
us in part payment of great britains war debts and
the returned warriors were sent to its great depopulated

cities to start the work of rehabilitation that has been
so successfully carried out

but things changed rapidly now jerome carter
was a young man but he had inherited from his
father and uncles the control of the corporate wealth
of three families and this total represented more than
two-thirds the wealth of the nation this man jerome
carter hated the gray multitude he possessed great
force of will and soon obtained complete mastery over
the other ten greatest magnates of the newly formed
united north america within ten years he was vir-
tual dictator of the new republic and he had taken the
last vestige of independence from the wearers of the
gray by his control of the president and of congress
he caused the enactment of legislation which took edu-
cation entirely from the lower levels of our cities that
is why you have been kept in ignorance of science his-
tory and all knowledge excepting that necessary to suit
you for an individual task that was assigned to you by
the government before you were born that is why
we traffic surreptitiously in books in our lower levels
and that is why the red police have been built up into
a great organization fostered by the minions of jerome
carter

  as a parallel to the complete subsidy of the govern-
ment and the degradation of the multitude in gray
jerome carter has kept europe and asia and the colo-
nies of the former great powers of those continents
from recovering from the effects of the great war
with their future mortgaged to his puppets they will
never reach economic independence since their labor is
all expended in wresting from the battle-scarred ground
the minerals and chemicals which constitute almost
their sole source of wealth and which is the sole me-
dium they have in which to pay their debts

  terrible terrible exclaimed aline whose eyes had
remained wonder-wide during the long recital and
the change is to be accomplished by you and mr
barton

  mostly by philip he replied and i imagine
mostly from this island

  a cheerful hail from the direction of the inquisitor
reached their ears

  breakfast folks came the cheery voice of mona
barton

  im hungry smiled aline

  me too said philip lifting her gaily to her feet

  the ensuing foot-race brought them up flushed and
panting at the entrance to the vessel the final spurt
to the breakfast table was made in record time

some fiendish action curbed

immediately following the morning meal
philip and kirk repaired to the laboratory where
they busied themselves with certain experiments
which had been interrupted by the carrying out of the
banishment decree it was in the results of these ex-
periments that philip hoped for the perfection of means
whereby the complete domination of the situation in
united north america could be effected the re-
mainder of the party set forth from the inquisitor to
explore the island which had given them temporary
refuge from the intolerable conditions to which they
were accustomed

  mona barton and aline sarov grew to be fast
friends in a very short time and the morning was not
yet half gone when the little girl in gray confided to her
new-found friend of the purple her hopes of future
happiness with the masterful kirk paulson at her side

  jack sterns with the true adventurous spirit of the
experienced air pilot set forth with tom easton and
a number of kirks followers to descend into the crater
and examine at close hand the wonders of nature that
presented so inviting an appearance when viewed from
above

  philip and kirk labored incessantly with the mecha-
nism of the strange instruments they were assembling
it was well after midday before they found oppor-
tunity to rest and it had been necessary to place the
refrigerating apparatus of the inquisitor in service on
account of the great heating effect of the blazing tropi-
cal sun which shone with all its fury on the metal hull
of the vessel

  it was with a tired sigh that philip looked up from
his work and observed the lateness of the hour

  kirk he said it is about time we cast an eye about
in new york and washington carters gang must be
watched closely

  no question of that philip agreed kirk and it
is after eight oclock by eastern standard time

  the detectoscope was placed in operation and since
its adjustments had not been changed since the preced-
ing evening the view of alexander dewolfs luxurious
library appeared on the screen at once the figure of
the water supply magnate was in the identical rigid po-
sition in which they last saw it the partly finished radio-
grams of the night before lying before him in the same
disorder

  that is certainly complete hypnosis said kirk
yes replied philip but it is only mechanically in-
duced and we have no control over the mans move-
ments or actions other than the mere imposition of the
trance-like state this will avail us little if we are not
successful with the revolutionary experiment on which
we are working

  you have not given up hope asked kirk

  no was the hesitant reply but there is something
i cannot seem to overcome some little thing perhaps
but it has so far proved elusive and we have little
time to lose heaven knows what carters next move
will be when he discovers that his orders to dewolf
have not been carried out

  look exclaimed kirk glancing at the screen
someone is entering the room

  a portly little man in gray came in hurriedly and as
he approached the desk of the financier they saw the
narrow purple band about his left sleeve that indicated
his attachment to the household in the capacity of valet
the look of astonishment that spread over the little
mans features when he saw the rigid form of his mas-
ter was ludicrous in the extreme and philip switched
on the detectophone attachment so they could listen to
his comments

  great grief spoke the agitated voice of the ser-
vant whats come over the old boy 

  an experimental forefinger pressed to the flabby por-
tion of dewolfs jowl and the little man almost tum-
bled over backward in his alarm

  hes stiff so he is he gasped dead thats what
he is help help
bartons island



  the pudgy little man was genuinely distressed but
philip and kirk could not repress their laughter at his
flustered alarm the excitable valet now rushed to a
bell cord and at his nervous but vigorous pulling on
its tasseled end the clangor of the alarm was heard
pealing through the adjoining rooms that were not vis-
ible in the screen

this is as good as a show laughed kirk as a
motley crowd of servants rushed into the room
some were attired in the familiar gray with the narrow
stripes of purple indicating their positions others
were scantily dressed and of disheveled appearance
all were greatly excited at sight of their master in his
unnatural position

  no jennis spoke one of the braver of the men as
he pressed a finger on the pulse of his master he
aint dead its a stroke of some kind hes got get
the doctor

  the ensuing confusion proved entertaining in the ex-
treme and the laughter of the two unsuspected wit-
nesses soon brought several members of the inquisitors
party to the laboratory the coming of meal time had
brought most of them back to the vessel and the cool-
ness of its interior was a welcome relief from the swel-
tering and unaccustomed heat of the outside

  a secretary in purple had now arrived on the scene
and he quickly took charge of the situation his first
radiovision call was for dewolfs physicians and the
second for jerome carter at the appearance of car-
ters visage in the imaged disk of the distant radiovision
instrument one of kirks followers growled out an
expression of rage and hate

  hush said philip

the officious and acid-tongued secretary was hus-
tling the servants from the room and the witnesses
watched in silence as he closed the door and tip-toed
back to the side of the rigid figure observing the
array of disordered papers he picked one of the blanks
from the desk and scanned its contents he whistled
in surprise and hastily gathered together the remaining
papers and stuffed them into a compartment of the
desk the physicians soon arrived and their mystifica-
tion over the condition of the patient brought smiles
and chuckles from the watchers in the laboratory of the
inquisitor

  a consultation ensued and when carter arrived and
learned the state of affairs he grew purple with rage

 you confounded medical men he stormed of
what use is your knowledge id like to know  here is
one of our greatest men a victim of some sort of an
attack and you cant even diagnose the case he had
important work to do and i presume it is still undone

  if you refer to the radiograms said the secretary
they were not sent

 where-where are they sputtered carter

  the secretary produced the sheaf and carter grasped
them and after reading the first carefully transferred
the lot to an inside pocket

  you will of course not speak of these he re-
marked to the secretary

  of course not was the response

  and carter his cheeks a bit paler than was their
wont stamped from the room without further converse
with the physicians

  we must follow him said philip hurriedly it
will be necessary to watch his every move for a time
adjustments of the apparatus kept him in view
throughout the speedy journey to his headquarters office
on his private pneumatic tube car which proved ex-
tremely diffiilt for barton to keep in focus carter
entered his own office in high dudgeon and rang for his
secretary at once

  call an immediate meeting of the council he thun-
dered all except dewolf-hes ill

  very well sir responded the secretary proceeding
to the radiovision instrument to carry out the order

  confound it growled carter glancing over the
papers reposing on his desk nothing done whatso-
ever well have the rats from below stirring up trou-
ble in no time

  he paced the floor impatiently as one by one the
members of the council were notified by the time the
first arrivals began to appear he was in a towering rage
and he herded them into the nearby council chamber
like so much cattle

  gentlemen he roared when all had assembled my
orders of last night to dewolf were not carried out
and we are in no better quite probably in worse condi-
tion than yesterday

  dewolf refused asked one of the members hope-
fully

  refuse he wouldnt dare shouted carter no
he was overcome by some sort of a stroke and is still
unconscious but our indulgence in sympathy for him
will do us no good another move must be planned and
at once

a heated discussion followed and the listeners
 on board the inquisitor were horrified at some of
the blood-curdling suggestions offered by those present
at the meeting these men appeared to be entirely de-
void of conscience where the gray-clad multitude was
concerned they spoke of wholesale slaughter of mil-
lions of their less fortunate fellow men as callously as
they would have spoken of the destruction of vermin
but it was evident that the dominance of jerome car-
ter was responsible the others were of innately softer
nature but were transformed into the beasts they ap-
peared to be by sheer force of his brutal will

  when they finally decided on a nation-wide round-up
of millions of the workers by the red police who had
orders to shoot to kill philip came to the conclusion
that it was time for drastic action

  folks he said this decision means civil war back
home the workers will resist and the carnage will be
dreadful if we allow this to take place it will be too
late to save our country and all our efforts thus far
will have been of no avail i am entirely against blood-
shed-even in the case of jerome carter-and i had
hoped to settle the great difficulty once and for all by
beneficial scientific means but i have thus far not
achieved success in the experiments along these lines
and to gain time for the continuance of the investiga-
tion that may lead to the desired means i am going to
put carter and his entire council in the hypnotic state
in which dewolf now lies they can live for a month
if necessary as the physicians will be able to continue
nourishment of the helpless bodies but carter will be
unable to plot harm of the serious nature now proposed
and kirk and i shall have time to work


amazing stories

  the crystal sphere still reposed oh the projectoscope
platform and it was the work of a moment to start the
apparatus that induced its eerie shimmering radiance
with strict orders to his companions to look away from
the ball philip turned to the screen of the detectoscope
and coupled to its mechanism the energy of the project-
ing apparatus with the appearance of the dim red
spot in the center of the table in that distant council
chamber jerome carter stopped short in his final tirade
and gazed unbelievingly at what he saw when the
blinking brilliance of the sphere materialized before the
startled eyes of the group there were cries of surprise
and fear carter jerked himself to his feet and tried
to draw back from the table but it was too late al-
ready had the powerful influence of the ghostly image
asserted itself and his eyes widened in terror as the
eye-balls twitched and rolled in rhythm with the flick-
erings of the unearthly weaving light when he saw
his companions stiffening to immobility under the bane-
ful influence he struggled against it with all the
strength of his mighty will by sheer force of that will
which had controlled the destinies of a great continent
for many a year he edged an inch or two from the table
beads of perspiration rolled from his forehead and the
cords of his neck stood forth like taut steel cables for
a moment it seemed that he would triumph and philip
increased the power with a shuddering groan carter
gave up the battle and his body stiffened like a statue
as he stood on his feet toppled to the floor with a crash
that brought the secretaries from an adjoining room to
the door with a rush

  thats that said philip touching a button that
caused the view of the startled assistants to fade from
the screen now we can dine



an hour later with jack and tom recruited as as-
sistants philip and kirk resumed their labors in
the laboratory they were safe as far as any danger
of further activities of carter were concerned but
haste was considered essential on account of the uncer-
tainties that would develop in the essential industries
and the resulting hardships that might be imposed on
the multitude in gray through the mere disorganizing
effect of the strange happenings in carters council

  late in the afternoon the men rested from their
labors and contact was obtained with president haven
through the medium of the detectoscope and its auxil-
iary instruments his face was wreathed in smiles as
he greeted the voice of philip when it first reached him

  my boy he said ill warrant this astounding
affliction which has come to jerome carter and his coun-
cil is some of your doing

  yes dad it is admitted philip is there any
suspicion to that effect

  not that i know of though i have no doubt that
those of the lower levels have some private opinions in
the matter but the newsspeakers have blared forth
bulletins all morning and the mystery of the thing has
taken the publics fancy the physicians are unable to
help them at all what have you done

  by means of an invention of mine they have all
been cast into a coma from which it will be impossible
to revive them without my intervention but they will
remain unharmed as long as they are kept supplied with
food and drink the doctors know how to accomplish
this so there will be no danger whatever it had to be

done when i detected them in a nefarious plot to spread
riot and bloodshed through the lower levels

  how long will you keep them in this state

  until i am assured of the success or failure of an
experiment i am now making the success of which will
change the entire condition now existing in our coun-
try i can tell you no more now meanwhile well
leave carter and his lieutenants asleep and allow the
public to conjecture as it pleases

  good work philip approved the president is
mona well

  never better dad ill let her speak with you and
the rest of the folks later

  they took their farewells and the four men resumed
their work in the laboratory with many a chuckle at
thought of the mystification of the great medical men
and of the excitement of the news announcers and the
puzzlement of the general public

an unexpected blow

randall haines was an exceedingly clever
secret service officer and his alert brain was
aroused to unusual activity by the news of the
strange and unprecedented illness which had attacked
jerome carter and his associates he turned the prob-
lem over and over in his mind and for some unac-
countable reason could not keep his thoughts from as-
sociating philip barton with the bizarre occurrence
but philip barton was dead he had with his own
eyes seen the inquisitor plunge beneath the tossing
waves of the atlantic bartons vessel had not reap-
peared and the locating later of the packing case which
floated to the surface seemed certain proof

  but was it philip barton was infernally clever he
reasoned and it was just possible that by some means
he had staged a fake accident and in some manner
escaped president haven did not seem to be taking
the loss of his daughter as much to heart as might be
expected though the family had taken to mourning and
was rarely seen in public

  try as he might he could not rid his mind of the
suspicion that somehow somewhere philip barton
was still in the land of the living and that by the use
of some secret invention of his he had accomplished the
impossible and caused the striking down of jerome
carter and his council if this were the case it was a
clear-cut job for the secret service and randall haines
needed no authority to proceed against barton at his
own discretion

  without consulting any of his men he made a secret
trip to the executive mansion he was passed by the
guards without question since they were men of his
own force and soon found a hiding place behind heavy
drapes in havens own dining-room patiently he
waited through the long period when the servants were
engaged in the setting of the table for the evening meal
there were to be no guests he deduced from the num-
ber of places set and he gloated over the fact for this
assured him that haven would talk freely with his
family

  when the president entered the room with mrs
haven on his arm haines scrutinized their features
carefully from his hiding place the calm dignity of
havens face gave him no clue nor did the quiet re-
serve of the first lady of the land but when the young-
bartons island



est daughter entered she was playfully jesting with the
brother ross junior and his suspicions were imme-
diately aroused

  the first course having been served the president
addressed his butler who stood conveniently close to
his high-backed chair parker he said you may
leave the room until i ring we have private affairs to
discuss

  haines hugged himself in anticipation as the butler
left and at the first words of the president he gloated
inwardly at the confirmation of his suspicions

  philip talked with me today was his quiet state-
ment 

  he did replied mrs haven joyfully are they
all right

  yes and he is going to talk with us later and let
us speak with mona through this marvelous invention
of his that requires neither transmitter nor receiver at
our end of the ether circuit

  frances and her brother jabbered excited comments
until it was necessary for their father to reprove them

  please allow me to continue he said it will be
of much interest to all of you to know that philip is
responsible for the strange illness of carter and his
associates but you must not speak of this to anyone

  how on earth did he do it father  asked the son

  i have not the slightest idea was the response but
we may learn more from him this evening

randall haines had heard more than enough
and he withdrew from his position cautiously
proceeding through the darkness of the adjoining sun-
room until he reached the passage which connected
with the main entrance to the apartments he encoun-
tered none of the servants and was passed from the
entrance by one of his own men to whom he gave
orders of silence and a warning that he would return
within an hour

  with all possible speed he hurried to the storerooms
of the department where he searched rapidly for an
instrument he had not used for years a portable direc-
tion finder he had some little difficulty in locating it
but finally emerged triumphant with a small black box
under his arm it was a short trip back to the execu-
tive living apartments but the public car in the pneu-
matic tube seemed abnormally slow when he greeted
the operative at the entrance it lacked just five minutes
of the hour he had mentioned

  sensing that something of importance was afoot the
operative had kept tabs on the movements of the presi-
dent and his family and he advised his superior that
they were in the drawing-room he further assisted
him by pointing out a circuitous route to a small room
from which haines could observe and listen with com-
plete safety

  this proved to be an alcove separated from the draw-
ing-room by portieres similar to those behind which he
had secreted himself at dinner time it was dimly il-
luminated by a small amount of light that filtered be-
tween the drapes from the larger room and it was the
matter of but a minute to set up the instrument he had
brought and to get it in operating position then he sat
quietly by listening to the desultory conversation of the
havens and awaiting his chance of checking up on
barton

  all unsuspecting haines espionage the haven

family discussed the matter in detail even mentioning
the fact that philip and mona were on an island in the
atlantic ocean of course they themselves had no
knowledge of its location but the direction finder would
solve that they spoke of the presence of kirk paul-
son and his companions with the exiles who had sup-
posedly been lost at sea haines congratulated himself
more and more on his astuteness and on the coup he
now saw he could make his thoughts of the rewards
that would be his when jerome carter recovered and
learned of his invaluable services proved so alluring
that he lost himself in contemplation of the honor and
wealth that would come to him thereby so engrossed
was he in his own day dreams that he lost much of the
conversation in the next room and he was startled from
his reverie by the sudden realization that philip bar-
tons voice had joined those of the presidents family

  why yes dad were the first words that impressed
him mona is right here

  hello folks then came the voice of the eldest
daughter

  randall haines was forced to admire the inventive
genius of the man who had made this perfect two-way
conversation possible through the ether with apparatus
functioning at only one end of the circuit but he did
not delay in getting his direction finder in operation
and he soon had seven readings that checked within a
small fraction of a degree with each other this work
completed he listened to the remainder of the conver-
sation but it was entirely of a personal nature and he
learned nothing more of value he made his way out
the same way he had entered and was soon on his way
to his own offices where he planned to spend the night
in preparation for an expedition against barton

  his first move on reaching his office was to get out a
large chart and to plot thereon the course indicated by
the readings of his direction finder to his surprise
this missed the coasts of both south america and
africa extending into the antarctic in a southeasterly
direction missing all charted islands on its way the
nearest to the line being ascension and st helena
islands

  that is peculiar he said to himself they dis-
tinctly said that barton was on some distant island i
must ask the advice of paul ott he is an authority
on geography

  he soon had his friend on the radio and asked him
to visit him at once in his office this request being
acceded to he loafed in his chair puffing vigorously at
his old black pipe and turning over in his mind a plan
to set forth in the morning to locate and arrest barton
and his party

  when paul ott arrived the two men bent over the
chart and the newcomer followed with his finger the
penciled line that haines had traced on it

  why said his friend when his finger reached a
point almost directly south of ascension island if you
are looking for an island on this course there is one
just about here

  but it is uncharted objected haines

  i know it is it is unnamed too but in the year
 a pilot on one of the cape town-to-pernambuco
air liners observed a seething in the ocean below his
vessel at this point and slowed down to investigate an
island of considerable size had been pushed above the
surface by subterranean volcanic action and the inter-


amazing stories

nal fires were being extinguished by the inpouring of
the ocean the spectacle proved to be so stupendous
and awe-inspiring that his vessel was delayed two hours
by requests of the passengers who wanted to remain
to watch this exhibition of natures creative handi-
work

  but would this island be habitable now asked
haines

  undoubtedly replied his friend it was visited
by explorers several times before the great war and was
reported as having cooled off however the war pre-
vented further visits and there have been no later ones
that i know of on account of the conditions that have
since existed in world relations but by this time it
should be covered with vegetation and though its cli-
mate is likely to be quite hot it should not be a bad
place for adventurous humans to find a place of
refuge

  eureka cried randall haines the very place
that a man of bartons caliber would choose he of
all men has probably visited this island before and ill
wager my next months credit that we shall find him
there



at daybreak the following day a sleek speedy
patrol ship of the secret service took the air and
in it were randall haines and twenty picked men of
the service being a captain and having great discre-
tionary powers he was enabled to set forth on this ex-
pedition without consulting his superiors and was thus
able to keep his mission an entire secret and his ela-
tion at the opportunity of obtaining a new feather for
his cap was unbounded

  hour after hour the helmsman kept to the course
prescribed by haines and after six hours of travel at
high altitude the patrol ship neared the island on which
barton and his little group had taken refuge

  here we are exulted haines as he made out the
tiny speck on the surface of the ocean which marked
the position of the unnamed island thats bartons
island below

  and the name was to attach itself permanently to the
small body of land and was to become famous in
history

  the patrol vessel slowly circled about dropping
gradually from its great altitude until within a thousand
feet of the shiny bulk of the inquisitor randall
haines could scarcely contain himself with joy at sight
of the yacht and he instructed his pilot to make as
quick a landing as possible his ship was thus brought
to a sudden somewhat jarring stop on the surface of
the rocky plateau only a few hundred feet from the
inquisitor he was the first to step from his vessel
and his men followed in haste with their weapons
ready and prepared for any emergency

  but there was no sign of life from bartons vessel
and haines and his men advanced cautiously toward its
open door when they were within fifty feet of the
entrance there was a shout from behind and haines
wheeled in his tracks to observe a party of about ten
men and women two of them in purple the rest in
gray this party was advancing from the direction of
the crater and its members were unarmed as far as
could be seen

  halt shouted haines menacing the leader with
his hand weapon which was capable of firing either

explosive bullets or the expanding flexible binders that
were used for capturing a victim and rendering him
helpless without serious injury

  tom easton advanced a step and haines recognized
him at once

  easton he ordered remain where you stand i
arrest you all in the name ofthe law tell your com-
panions to throw down any vseapons they may have
we have none replied tom haughtily and the
law of united north america does not reach to this
island

  oh yes it does easton said haines i have
taken formal possession of it in the name of our gov-
ernment this island is unclaimed by other powers
from the corner of his eye tom easton observed that
kirk paulson watched the proceedings from the door
of the inquisitor for a moment then withdrew hastily
to the interior

  all right haines he said quietly we surrender
  wheres barton asked his captor

  somewhere about the island answered tom eva-
sively we surrender but dont think for a minute that
well aid you in locating and capturing our leader
one of the girls in gray started sobbing and jack-
sterns stepped to her side to comfort her

  keep your places now ordered haines then to
his men bind them boys

  his men advanced on the group and despite some
little struggling on the part of the men soon had the
entire party bound hand and foot and seated on the
hard rocks tom easton suspecting that jack sterns
was about to let loose on their captors with some of the
strongest words in his vocabulary hissed in his ear and
managed to convey to him the knowledge that those
within the inquisitor were aware of the state of affairs
the news somehow passed throughout the group and
all of the captives remained quiet giving the appear-
ance of submitting with humility



in the laboratory of the inquisitor were the remain-
ing members of the barton party philip and kirk
having been at work on the mysterious experiment on
which so much depended aline and mona had been
assisting also though their help consisted mostly of
passing sprightly comments which in nowise bothered
the workers when kirk returned from his visit to
the entrance door and advised them of the coming of
the patrol ship and the capture of the other members of
their party there was consternation for a moment
then philip burst forth

  randall haines he exclaimed confound him
for his spying he has located us with a direction
finder as sure as you are alive but well fix him

  he rushed to the projectoscope and replaced on its
platform the crystal sphere which had been removed
during some of their experiments the apparatus was
soon in operation and at the screen of the detectoscope
philip rapidly manipulated the controls until he had a
view of the immediate outside randall haines and
his entire party had turned toward the inquisitor and
were advancing in close formation to its entrance not
a moment too soon the image of the sphere materialized
at the very doorstep of the vessel and haines drew
back in alarm as his eyes were smitten by its dazzling
colors twinkling with vivid brilliancy even in the bright
sunlight
bartons island



  what devilment is this ejaculated the captain of
the secret service squad in alarm

  philip increased the power rapidly and in a few sec-
onds his enemies were stretched lifeless on the ground
a great cheer was raised by the prisoners and mona
and aline hugged each other in their glee philip and
kirk rushed to the outside followed by the two women

  it was the work of but a few minutes to release the
captives and then philip turned his attention to the
lifeless forms of their enemies

some fine material for our experiments he com-
mented especially haines let us carry them inside
the twenty men who had accompanied haines on the
trip to the island were carried to beds in various state-
rooms of the inquisitor and there left to remain in their
stupor until philip chose to release them but randall
haines was carried to the laboratory and his body was
straightened to a prone position on the operating table
philip said mona youre not going to hurt him 
no indeed dear replied her spouse if my ex-
periment works i am going to make a good citizen of
him if it does not he will not be harmed

  a small replica of the projectoscope tower that had
been erected alongside the inquisitor was wheeled to
the end of the operating table and its short tube was
swung around on the trunnions until the blunt end was
directed toward the back of haines head

  the apparatus on which they had been working was
hastily looked over and at a nod of approval from
philip kirk connected a pair of cables from the jumble
of instruments on the long table to the end of the pro-
jectoscope tube opposite the subject a small motor-
generator hummed merrily beneath the table at a touch
of a switch and the row of vacuum tubes along the
wall lighted with their purple glow a series of black-
and-white keys like those of a piano were arranged be-
side the condensers and inductances that were massed
before the lighted tubes and philip ran his fingers ex-
perimentally along these in swift alternation the vac-
uum tubes responded with flashes of increased bril-
liancy

  okay kirk he said and kirk pulled the switch
that set the air of the entire room vibrating with the
high frequency waves emitted from that harmless-
appearing tube that was trained on the recumbent
figure of randall haines an aura surrounded the head
of the subject a hazy purplish light that hid his shock
of curly black hair in a weird mist

  there was a cross-section chart of a human brain on
the wall near the instrument and many notations had
been made opposite various sections of the pictured
gray matter philip scanned this chart closely as he
ran his fingers over the piano-like keys the vibrating
air of the laboratory changed its rate continuously with
throbbing pulsations that followed the movements of
philips careful fingers all those in the room watched
in breathless wonder as philip seemed like one inspired
then he ceased his movements and turned to the sub-
ject with a thoughtful look in his eyes glancing once
more at the chart he pulled the switch and with the
resulting slowing down of the motor-generator com-
plete silence fell in the laboratory the cessation of
the throbbing pulsations which had set the ear-drums
of the watchers singing left a queer echoing silence
that left them all mute the still figure on the operat-
ing table remained as rigid as before

  all finished said philip solemnly now well
awaken him and learn whether we were successful or
not

   a successful operation

philip placed a stethoscope on haines breast
and listened intently for a moment then smiled
his satisfaction

  heart perfectly normal he sai

  but what do you hope has been accomplished in this
experiment asked jack sterns

  the remainder of the group hung on philips words
as he replied

  jack he said and i might as well tell the rest of
you now that i think i have been successful it is my
belief that we have just altered the brain of randall
haines in those portions controlling his sense of values
of right and wrong his conscience and his morals it
has been known for centuries that in a person of crimi-
nal tendencies there is an abnormality of the brain it
has thus been customary to perform surgical operations
on these diseased brains and thereby restore the crimi-
nal to normality and transform him into a useful citi-
zen but these operations have always been performed
by actually cutting into certain portions of the brain
and removing irritating objects abscesses and the like
and in no cases have they been performed on other than
actual criminals or insane persons my invention
which i shall call the psycho-convertor is intended to
perform such operations bloodlessly and painlessly by
subjecting the involved portions of the brain to the
action of high frequency electrical vibrations of a heal-
ing and vitalizing nature these rays penetrate like
the x-ray and by setting the brain cells in rapid oscilla-
tion can produce complete changes of their structure
and functions if we are successful we shall find that
randall haines is an entirely different person when he
returns to consciousness

  wonderful astounding revolutionary were
the comments that greeted this announcement and the
entire party gathered closely about the operating table
to observe the next move to be made by the great in-
ventor

  stand back a bit folks warned philip if this
thing is not a success you may come to personal harm
when he awakens and it is a very simple matter to
bring him around

  the group drew back a few feet and philip wheeled
to the side of the operating table a small stand on which
there was mounted a small glass bulb with several pro-
jections to which wires were attached in much the same
manner as on an x-ray tube this was adjusted so that
the surface of the cathode presented an angle of forty-
five degrees to the head of the patient and when philip
set its energizer working there was a slight crackling
sound from the vicinity of the tube but no visible rays
emanated from it

randall haines stirred slightly then opened
one eye at a time and looked dazedly at the white
ceiling overhead suddenly he sat erect with a quick
inquiring glance about the room he peered into the
eyes of his erstwhile enemy philip barton and his face
was wreathed in a friendly smile

  barton he said i have been entirely wrong in


amazing stories

making this trip to capture you in fact i have been
wrong for years in my feeling toward you if you can
forgive me i wish you would give me your hand
gladly said philip extending his hand and grip-
ping that of haines in a friendly squeeze how do
you feel old man

  great replied haines springing from the table to
the floor and surveying the astounded group never
felt better in my life barton but what on earth have
you done to me

  philip smiled enigmatically im sorry old man it
was necessary to hypnotize you and your followers in
self-defense he said but i am glad you are taking
it in this manner

  haines looked puzzled for a moment perfectly all
right he said you did the only thing you could do
humanely you should have handled us far more
roughly but i cant understand whatever possessed
me to persecute you all these years and to embark on
this foolhardy expedition why-why-i must have
been crazy and carter-jerome carter-how could i
have adhered to him for so long at last i have come
to my senses and i swear i shall make things up to
you

  philip glanced in the direction of his friends with a
distinctly warning look they understood that they
were to say nothing

  then randall haines laughed aloud then this is
the same thing you did to carter and his council  he
asked

  yes grinned philip and ill awaken them all in
good time meanwhile we should awaken your com-
panions can you guarantee their friendliness to my
followers 

  absolutely said haines they will obey my
orders implicitly and ill confess my error and call
them off at once

  haines men were brought singly to the operating
table and individually subjected to the action of the
resuscitation tube in the case of each man a few words
were spoken in private by haines and instructions given
regarding their future conduct toward barton and his
party when the last man was restored to normal
their leader gave them a talk concerning the action that
had been taken by barton against carter and the mem-
bers of his council philip and his friend exchanged
wondering glances at the evidence of so complete a
change in the attitude of randall haines he had actu-
ally become a champion of the cause of the gray-clad
multitude and held forth in much the manner of one of
their own number at home with the exception that he
spoke even more boldly and his change of heart
toward the dictator was a revelation he swore that
he would devote every effort toward assisting in the
rehabilitation of the republic of united north america
as a true republic and in the overthrow of the dictator-
ship of carter

  when he had finished his men expressed their
amazement in no uncertain terms but agreed that there
was much in what he had said and that they would
support any action that promised success since they be-
lieved that his words were frank statements of truth
that some of them were thinkers was evident from
comments they made but it was equally evident that
they shared the general lackadaisical viewpoint of the
wearers of the purple and were on general principles

content to let things remain as they were provided they
themselves continued in their present positions of favor
with the power behind the administration it was how-
ever clear to all that they were cognizant of the injus-
tice of existing conditions and would prove friendly to
the wearers of the gray provided the power of carter
and his council was in some manner overcome

   the entire proceedings were a revelation to all of the
inquisitors party and more especially to kirks fol-
lowers who had been brought up with the idea that all
wearers of the purple were their implacable hereditary
enemies



when the secret service squad left the inquisi-
tor to explore the island some of them walked
arm and arm with members of bartons party and it was
not long before extremely friendly relations were estab-
lished philip called haines aside and asked him to
return to the laboratory and there discuss with kirk
and himself further action to be taken with regard to
the elimination of the dictatorship haines agreed en-
thusiastically and followed philip to the laboratory
where the three made themselves comfortable while
philip expanded on his immediate plans

  haines said philip it has given me more pleasure
than i have known for many a year to find you so com-
pletely in sympathy-with our ideas for the alleviation of
conditions in the lower levels of the great cities of
united north america and if you will align your-
self with us it will be of great advantage to the cause
i most assuredly will philip said randall haines
sincerely i dont know what it is but there was some-
thing about that hypnotic stunt of yours that has altered
my outlook on life entirely i feel like a new man and
more at peace with my conscience than at any time since
i was a boy what are your plans 

  they are really quite simple randall said philip
the eleven men who are still in the hypnotic state
back in our country must of course be returned to con-
sciousness my one unalterable decision in this entire
matter was that no bloodshed would be countenanced
this is a revolution but there are to be no fatalities
now ill just ask you one question what is your idea
of the outcome of the thing if by some miracle jerome
carter should experience a change of heart such as the
one you have just gone through 

  if he did not lose his forceful personality and tre-
mendous will replied randall haines i am confident
that the entire course of events would be altered i
believe he would bend every effort toward the undoing
of all harm that has been accomplished by his actions
in the past and that he would restore the people to their
rightful heritage of true liberty and freedom and sup-
port the government in all things to the end of benefit-
ing all in the country and favoring none it would be a
marvelous change but it is inconceivable

  not impossible randall stated philip you
have heard of perhaps you have even witnessed opera-
tions on the brains of criminals which have removed
from them forever the criminal tendencies and restored
to them normal well-balanced organs thus transform-
ing these criminals into useful citizens i have recently
perfected a means of performing such operations by the
use of high-frequency vibrations that act on the proper
brain centers and completely alter the functioning of
the particular portions affected these vibrations can
bartons island



be employed for all brain operations and do not necessi-
tate cutting into the cranial cavity i propose to return
to new york and to use my apparatus on carter

  haines opened his eyes wide is there no danger to
the patient in such a procedure 

  none whatever philip replied in fact the health
of the patient should be improved and it is my own
thought that if carter is transformed into a straight-
thinking individual it will be unnecessary to experi-
ment with his associates what do you think

  i think you are absolutely right philip he can
keep them all in line without the slightest trouble as
a matter of fact i feel sure that several members of the
council will welcome the change

  that is my idea also said philip and i am anx-
ious to return immediately and go ahead with the
plans

  can it not be done from here by means of the
searching and penetrating rays of the detectoscope
asked kirk

  it probably could said philip but i am afraid to
chance it in so important a case we will experiment
later along those lines but not on human beings until
there is absolute certainty of success the human brain
is an exceedingly delicate organ you know

  it beats me philip interjected haines admiringly
how you are able to accomplish such unheard-of things
one after another in quick succession and now that i
am in your laboratory i am very curious for one
thing i should like to know how on earth you have
been able to converse with your friends and relatives
at home and how you put carter and his gang to sleep
from this far-off point

philip laughed and consulted his watch ill tell
you what well do randall he said its quite
early in the day here but it is mid-afternoon now in
new york well start for home at once so as to
arrive there in the early evening you remain on board
the inquisitor and allow the pilot to return the patrol
vessel to its own berth on the journey ill demon-
strate my latest inventions those that have permitted
us to accomplish the things you have mentioned
what do you say 

  nothing would please me better said haines his
eyes shining in anticipation like a boys the sooner
the better

   its a go said philip starting at once for the out-
doors where he set up a call for all members of the
party to return to the vessel

  they hurried in from all directions and with the
help of randall haines and his squad it was a short
job to dismantle the projectoscope tower and stow its
sections away in the compartments of the inquisitor
haines gave his men their orders and they returned to
the patrol ship which was soon ready for the
return trip

  philip checked up on his own party and found that
all were present with the exception of kirk and aline

  kirk kirk he called

  coming came an answering voice from the rim of
the crater and the sheepishly smiling face of the tall
young man in gray came into view as he tugged at
alines hand and assisted her to the level surface of the
plateau

  i went to find aline he explained as they ap-

proached the grinning group at the entrance of the
inquisitor

  so i see laughed philip

  aline spoke up brightly and unabashed kirk and
i have just become engaged she announced

  great stuff aline said plp grasping her hand
and turning to the embarrassed kirk congratula-
tions old man he continued transferring his hand-
clasp to his friend of the past several years neither
of you could have done better

  mona had the little girl in gray clasped in a close
embrace and she whispered words of happiness to her

  there was a shout from the patrol vessel and with
a swish and the waving of many hands from its win-
dows it rose vertically and was soon lost to the sight
of the watchers who waved their farewells gaily

  there was no further delay and it was not long be-
fore the inquisitor had taken to the air and was on its
way to far-off new york

in the navigating cabin where philip had just relin-
quished the controls to jack sterns little aline sarov
her hand in kirks spoke sadly as they watched the
outlines of the island fade from view far beneath them
kirk she said id like to come back

  me too said kirk

  perhaps you may said philip i intend to estab-
lish a colony here after things are settled back home-
perhaps erect a laboratory of my own at the rim of the
crater it is an ideal spot to get away from the rush
and bustle of our modern life

  yes agreed randall haines and it shall be
known as bartons island ill see to that you know
i staked claim on the island for our government
philip grinned but mona and aline applauded en-
thusiastically



seven hours later in the bed chamber of jerome
carter the apparatus of philips psycho-convertor
was adjusted in position at the bedside of the sleeping
dictator gathered in a silent group were kirk ran-
dall haines president haven and three physicians who
scowled and hem-hawed over the proceedings

  when the motor-generator commenced its musical
hum randall haines uttered a startled exclamation

  why you old rascal he said to philip thats
what you did to me why didnt i realize it before
sorry  asked philip smiling as he continued with
his adjustments

  sorry repeated haines ill never be able to
thank you enough but well speak more of that later
the operation was soon completed then replacing
the ray director of the psycho-convertor came the re-
suscitation tube all witnesses held their breath as its
sputtering commenced and carters eyelids flickered

  in less than a minute the great man bounded from his
bed and stared about him unbelievingly his eyes
shone with a new light as they fell on philip barton
then he advanced slowly until he faced the inventor
hesitatingly he stretched forth his hand and touched
philips cheek gently

  then he spoke in a choked voice thank god
youre alive philip he said  how glad i am

  he grasped both hands of the man he had so recently
conspired against and wrung them as if his souls sal-
vation depended on the friendship of the inventor

amazing stories

secure in russia he had come from russia to amer-
ica because america especially new york city was
thought by all the world to be the great center of
unused wealth

   thanks to his very creditable letters of introduction
he was at once granted an interview with the president
of the new york university that gentleman was glad
to spend some time with the celebrated visitor from
russia in spite of the fact that he was very busy with
the pre-commencement work in addition to being
greatly worried over the calamity that had befallen his
co-workers chenenko lost no time in giving his rea-
sons for leaving his native land

  honored sir he began i need money-lots of
money-and many learned scientists for my students
i need a large place to work in with very expensive
apparatus if you give me all this i shall be glad to
stay here the rest of my life in your so remarkable
university otherwise i am compelled to go to the far-
west city of chicago

   you will not have to go to chicago replied presi-
dent jacob hubler in a very decided and emphatic
manner tell me what line of work you are doing
the variety of research and i will do everything in my
power to assist you

  in answer the russian went into the most minute
details describing the work of his lifetime at the end
professor hubler was dazed but convinced at least
he was willing to give the biologist his opportunity to
succeed or fail success he knew would be an eternal
triumph for new york over the entire intellectual
world

  all that summer professor chenenko and a group of
the greatest surgeons in the east worked with feverish
haste enormous laboratories were hastily constructed
conference after conference was held meantime pro-
fessor after professor left apparently for the summer
vacation

  september finally came the university of new
york opened as usual to a greater number of students
than had ever before matriculated classes were at
once started the professors capped and gowned
were all seated in their respective classrooms lecturing
more brilliantly than ever junior professors circulated
through the university assisting with the scientific
work holding quizzes and helping backward pupils
there was every evidence that this would be the great-
est year in the educational history of new york the
statisticians pointed with pride to the fact that the en-
rollment in the eastern city was three thousand more
than in chicago



a small group of men gathered in a chicago
hotel bedroom the room had been secretly se-
lected on purpose for this meeting a multi-millionaire
and two scientists were present the captain of indus-
try looked and was thoroughly hard-boiled with-
out mincing words he began

   gentlemen when i spend a million dollars i expect
results all that i can see that has happened in the last
eight months is this instead of new york having one
thousand more pupils than chicago as in former years
she has three thousand more all the professors are
well more keenly intellectual than ever there is a spirit
of success throughout the entire new york faculty
and they are boasting that they have chicago on the run

at last meanwhile you two men have my million dol-
lars what about it

  something went wrong replied one of the men
you know that we performed that experiment on a
dozen dogs then we tried it on those three men and
in every case the sarcoma killed in three months we
know that every new york professor including presi-
dent hubler was thoroujjily infected on the night of
the banquet everyone ate heartily of the sweetbread
patties that evening and we had enough sarcoma cells
in them to kill a thousand men and we know this
some of those men actually developed sarcoma ma-
lignanta our detectives assured us of that then
these two hundred men disappeared as soon as college
was over in june and when the fall term opened not
one of them was absent from his lecture room

  something happened it is unreasonable to suppose
that all of them escaped infection it is more than
likely that most of them developed this sarcoma our
experiments show that once the infection occurs it is a
hopeless case the tumor travels upward from the
feet till it kills

  the millionaire frowned

  meantime not a word from them to indicate that
they suspect foul play

  not a word everything is as fine as can be in
fact they have even gone so far as to offer the chicago
university fifty post-graduate courses free of charge
that is a crowning insult as if chicago could not
furnish its own post-graduate courses

  then all i get for my million is failure

  it is not our fault answered the third man shrug-
ging his shoulders we did our best they were just
too clever for us probably they discovered a curative
serum

  but you told me there was no cure

  we do not know of any

  and there the matter rested

  the rivalry between the two universities went on
but in some way for some intangible reason the new
york university gradually assumed the lead in educa-
tional matters within ten years many of the profes-
sors at the chicago university began to show the signs
of old age their mentality was no longer capable of
absorbing valuating and lecturing on the new facts
constantly being discovered the new generation
seemed strangely lacking in educational initiative when
compared with the older men it was a peculiar cir-
cumstance however that the advance of old age did not
seem to affect the faculty of the eastern city those
men grew more brilliant than ever neither did age
wither nor did time effect decay the faculty seemed to
live on in perpetual vigor constantly increasing in bril-
liancy

  the captain of industry from chicago was defeated
but not depressed he was more determined than ever
to place his beloved university ahead of the eastern
seat of learning accustomed to solve difficult ques-
tions in the business world he was eager to attack the
unknown problems in this inter-city rivalry there was
one point that he could not solve

 why did the professors of chicago
grow old while the new york pro-
fessors remained young

  that question kept the capitalist in a state of neu-
rotic insomnia he consulted every noted physician
the eternal professors



and scientist in the mississippi valley not one of
them was able to give him a sensible or reasonable an-
swer so in despair he determined to investigate the
matter himself he called into his service the head of
a world-famous detective bureau and told him to find
just what the difference was in the lives of the two sets
of teachers

  it took only a short month to secure a report it
seemed that the new york men lived in seclusion in
the university buildings all of them including the
president were curiously separated from their fami-
lies they took no exercise they seemed to save in
every way their physical strength they lectured in
low even tones always they were seated and they
made no gestures the students were never allowed to
go near them or visit them all special work was done
by lesser members of the faculty these old members
of the faculty had for ten years refused invitations to
all banquets had never taken any part in politics and
were absolutely unavailable for public speaking evi-
dently they were leading abnormal lives which while
very anti-social still enabled them to perform their col-
legiate duties in a very efficient manner

  the most interesting part of the report was their
manner of study it was discovered that reading stands
had been constructed which held the books at a con-
venient distance from the eyes when one of the pro-
fessors wished to read an assistant placed a book on
this stand and slowly turned the pages it appeared
that the readers never lifted a hand to personally turn
over a new leaf

all this information simply gave the chicago mil-
lionaire more bills to pay and more inexplicable
facts to think over to do him full justice it must be
said that he approached the problem in a systematic
logical manner these new york men were retaining
their youth and mental vigor while the chicago men
were growing old the financier ascertained a variety
of facts about the eastern men the great outstand-
ing ones were that they refused absolutely to take any
physical exercise or to indulge in any social activity
apart from the classroom and it even appeared that they
had given up family life remaining in seclusion in the
university with this difference to explain the rich
man from the west called in the aid of the most noted
authority on geriatrics or the diseases of old age

  it is a most peculiar circumstance mr bowlers
agreed dr caruth following the receipt of your
letter i went to new york and as far as i could with-
out arousing comment and criticism i looked over those
men i heard some of them lecture they seem to
be mentally alert and in the best of health but i never
saw men that were so nearly motionless they change
their facial expression while talking they move their
eyeballs and wink but beyond that they are immobile
just like statues there is certainly something very
peculiar about it-but i can assure you of one thing
those men have a surprising mentality for their age
and they look much younger than they really are i
never thought that complete muscular inertia was a
beneficial thing in fact i have always advised my old
people to move around and take exercise perhaps i
was wrong the surprising point is the ability of the
university to induce two hundred men of such brilliant
mental prowess to lead lives of such complete isolation

if they are doing this out of devotion to the university
it is the most wonderful example of group sacrifice for
education that i have ever heard of

  the situation was indeed a peculiar one

  put yourself in their place dr caruth said peter
bowlers would you lead that kind of a life unless
you were forced to

  i certainly would not

  do you suppose thejj are being coerced 

  certainly not all of them-not two hundred intelli-
gent men

  then why are they doing it 

  i dont know

  just then the private secretary brought in a radio-
gram from new york bowlers opened it impatiently
then he swore as he exclaimed

  what do you make of this dr caruth this is
from the head of my detective agency he says that
those new york men are acting the way they are be-
cause they cannot do anything else he believes that
something is wrong with their bodies has positive
proof that their hands are made out of something like
wax

  fairy tales

  maybe so but i am off to new york in my pri-
vate plane i just have to know more about this mat-
ter come with me

  cant leave my patients wish i could

  just as soon as one of the fastest planes in the world
could carry him peter bowlers went to new york and
was at once closeted with the detective who had sent
him the radiogram

  it is all true mr bowlers the detective said ear-
nestly we believe that those professors are there
because they cannot move they are closely guarded
but our student-detectives wearing very strong eye-
glasses have been working on the problem from that
viewpoint most of the professors wear gloves all the
time but those who are without gloves have hands that
seem to be made out of something like wax and if
they have bodies those bodies are very insensitive we
were able in a few cases to stick pins into them and
there was absolutely no reaction those men just sit
there twenty-four hours a day as far as we can tell
we established an observation point in an overhead
garret and we have had men at the peep-hole for over
a hundred hours steady and the professor under ob-
servation has never moved

  peter bowlers took the detective by the shoulder and
shook him roughly as he whispered 

  listen to me man i am worth over two hundred
million you solve this mystery if it takes the whole
amount to pay your bribes or any other expenses you
find out what is wrong with those men

  i can spend anything

  anything the sky is the limit and i am going to
stay right here till you deliver the goods

  peter bowlers did just the thing that he threatened
to do he stayed in new york for over two weeks eat-
ing his heart out with desperate longing to solve the
problem then like an explosion everything became
plain

  we should have suspected it before said the de-
tective the reason those men dont move is because
they are unable to they just cant they are
heads without bodies and every one is con-


amazing stories

nected up with a series of tubes through which some
kind of blood is pumped into their heads i suppose
there is a compressed air tube that enables them to
talk

  i dont want any drunken man to use my money
commented bowlers expect me to believe that
draw your pay and quit

  but it is true

  impossible

  absolutely true i saw it with my own eyes just
heads that is all they have been for ten years they
had a russian come over and amputate their heads
from their bodies or their bodies from their heads
whichever way would be correct either way sounds
peculiar to me it seems those professors had some
peculiar form of cancer and this russian saved their
lives by cutting off their infected bodies odd ill
say so then he kept the heads alive by pumping
something like blood into the arteries of their necks and
pumping or sucking it out of their veins do you
understand made an artificial circulation of blood
through their heads kept them alive and working he
pumps air through their larynx and they are able to
talk and give lectures i even found that they had a
celebrated voice culturist give them special training in
talking with the new source of air

  o course this russian was the brains back of the
entire programme i felt that if we could secure his
private papers we might learn something i found a
man that could read russian handwriting and then the
old scientist received a wire to come to boston to con-
sult about a case of course the patient was one of
our operators just as soon as the russian left the city
we got into his office and locking the door went
through his papers we found just what we were
looking for a private diary giving in detail everything
he had done since his arrival in america it seems that
he was forced to come to america on account of lack of
funds to carry on his work so he went to see presi-
dent hubler of new york university here is the way
our russian interpreter translated that part of the
record

    at last i have come to the place where i can ac-
  complish my long hoped for ambition i now have
  friends and unlimited sources of money more
  money than i ever thought existed my poverty is
  at an end what a fine man president hubler is

  i told him i was interested in the transplantation of
  organs that in the future the learned men who de-
  veloped kidney disease would have their damaged
  kidneys taken out and healthy organs put in i told
  him that only three essentials were necessary first
  to remove the organ before actual death occurred
  second to keep the organ alive till we were ready to
  use it and third to successfully unite it with the
  new body then i paid full honor to my dear
  teacher professor brjuckenenko who taught me the
  cardinal points in this work i explained that as
  early as  this wonderful biologist and surgeon
  had cut a dogs head off and had kept that head alive
  for as long as three hours by the establishment of
  artificial circulation that was many years ago and
  it was necessary to explain the great advance we had
  made since that time how well i remember the ex-
  citement that followed brjuckenenkos announce-

  ment george bernard shaw had a lengthy inter-
  view published in the tageblatte shaw thought that
  it might be the means of indefinitely prolonging the
  usefulness of great men of affairs he suggested that
  when a noted man developed a condition like cancer
  his head should be amputated at once and his in-
  telligence be preserved for the benefit of future
  generations

     president hubler was greatly interested in this
  he asked if i had improved my masters technique
  how strange that he thought i had worked w all
  these years without progress i brought in my dog
  grecco in his little coffin-like box my wonderful
  grecco the dog who had lived without a body for
  ten years thanks to my remarkable artificial circu-
  lation and synthetic blood i had grecco bark and
  show pleasure when i scratched his head the presi-
  dent asked me if i could do that with a man how
  strange that this head of a great university has no
  imagination if it can be done with a dog why not
  with a man i said yes give me the man and i
  will do it he asked me if i could do it with two
  hundred men i said yes if i have ample money
  and trained assistants then he told me that all
  the faculty were going to die of sarcoma and asked
  if i would take the responsibility of operating on
  them what a wonderful thing it will make me
  famous forever to save two hundred learned pro-
  fessors to posterity i am to begin as soon as gradu-
  ation is over in the meantime i will at once start
  building my apparatus

    the conversation with president hubler brought
  out many interesting points fortunately in every
  part of the discussion i was able to satisfy him of my
  ability especially were we interested in the effect
  on the intelligence of these men we expected to de-
  capitate would they retain their mental poise in-
  crease their educational ability as years passed or
  would they grow old decrepit and senile 

     we also had to discuss the matter of their talk-
  ing would they be able to lecture what change
  would appear in their voice i was sure that the
  supply of air could be so accurately measured and
  controlled that they would be able to talk as perfectly
  as ever in my operations i would be sure to con-
  serve the nerve that controlled the movements of the
  laryngeal cords

    how fortunate it was that i had perfected the
  manufacture of synthetic blood what a wonderful
  fluid that was a fluid that performed every vital
  function of human blood and yet which could be
  scientifically and accurately manufactured outside of
  the body and which could be perfectly gleansed of
  all impurities every time it made one circulation of
  the head that is what is keeping grecco so young
  and i am sure that our bodyless professors will not
  grow old i do not know how long they will live
  but i am sure if they are carefully guarded against
  infections and if machinery is oh so constantly
  watched that they will live on for many years

  how does that sound to you mr bowlers do you
still think that i am drunk here is a later entry
which tells how the experiment was carried on

    july th-i am busy teaching my technique to a
  dozen of the most expert surgeons that i have ever
the eternal professors



  seen every man is first required to operate on at
  least a dozen dogs the pumping machines are being
  built very rapidly my chemists are all working on
  the preparation of the artificial blood they have
  remarkable ability to learn quickly we must work
  rapidly for all of the two hundred heads must be
  ready to lecture by sept th besides the sooner
  we free the heads from the bodies infected with sar-
  coma the more sure we will be of their going on with
  their useful work

  bowlers jumped out of his chair as he shouted

  that explains everything i understand now why
they did not die from the cancer eleven years ago you
send a full report to me i am going back to chicago
to see some men there you keep on working you
are probably right but it is so absurd that no one will
believe us so we might as well keep quiet you bribe
your men to secrecy and keep on working i will
come back

peter bowlers went back to chicago and lo-
cated the man who had performed the sarcanoma
inoculations for him eleven years ago this man dr
albert johnson was a remarkable scientist and a very
unprincipled man otherwise he was always willing
to do anything provided there was enough money in it
he had scattered cholera bacteria all over northern
india for the russian government and had no scruples
in endeavoring to kill the entire new york faculty
he was more than surprised to see bowlers the last
interview that he had had with that man was not a
very pleasant one the rich man lost no time in telling
the reason for his visit

  you remember that sarcoma experiment johnson
  very well mr bowlers

  i gave you a million for doing it and at the time i
felt that in some way you had double-crossed me you
know that not one of those professors died

  yes i guess that is right

  you cannot blame me for being annoyed i was
sure that you made a bust of it i learned something
in new york city that makes it necessary for me to
apologize to you the sarcoma infection was a  per-
cent success

  but not a one died

  no but they had to do something that i never
thought was possible they took those two hundred
professors and amputated them one by one at the neck
did you know that a surgeon could do that

  i know that years ago a russian called brjucke-
nenko claimed to be able to do something like that
with a dogs head but he only kept the head alive for
three hours

  did he have a pupil

  perhaps yes there was a peculiar recluse by the
name of chenenko i remember reading that he had
come to america and then he disappeared

  he is the man who did the work on the new york
faculty here is the way i have it figured out every
one of those men developed your new form of cancer
they realized the danger-their surgeons saw that it
was hopeless perhaps they suspected some of us men
from chicago but the charge was so unheard of and the
proof so slight that they felt it best to keep quiet then
this russian came and they saw a hope they were

sure that the men were all doomed anyway so they
had him teach them how to operate and makehe neces-
sary pumps and artificial blood-and now for over
ten years there have been just heads teaching there but
they are young and vigorous and brilliant and our
faculty is growing old almost senile

  i believe that you are right replied the biologist
well what are you going to do about it i hate
that new york school just as much as ever they
have the best of us now cannot something be done
disconnect the pumps poison them in some way
hit them on the head with an ax anything to make
it possible for chicago to regain her lost supremacy
you say there is no sign of age

  evidently none

  seems that something ought to be done to put them
out of their suffering

  oh they do not seem to be suffering in fact
i believe most of them are having a good time but
that is not the point they are making it possible for
new york to have a far better university than chicago
can you suggest any remedy

  let me think over it i suppose there would be the
usual fee

  yes one million exactly-paid after you suc-
ceed i am not going to pay that much money for any
more failures

  all right that is a gentlemans agreement

  it will have to be suicide to put it on paper

  and that was the end of the conference

the next spring was a tragic one for the university
of new york within a few weeks over half of
their professors died of apoplexy and many of those
who escaped death were so paralyzed that they were
unable to lecture the death rate was alarming it is
true that the aged chicago professors were also passing
out but not at such a rapid pace the new york
savants who remained alive were irritable forgetful
had periods of alternating laughter and tears swore at
their classes began to sleep when they should have been
lecturing necessity forced the employment of many
of the younger assistants as full professors a large
per cent of the pupils disgusted with the educational
facilities left for other colleges

  one day near the time of graduation the president of
chicago university received a message from the presi-
dent of the new york college to come east for an inter-
view the message was brought in such a way that in
spite of the natural pride of the man from chicago it
was impossible for him to refuse he therefore took
the first passenger plane east accompanied by the com-
mittee who had brought the invitation

the meeting was held in the private study of the
president of new york university jacob hubler
looked more dignified than ever as he sat motionless
except for the restless movement of his eagle eyes
at the meeting the presidents of a dozen of the great
colleges of the land were present these colleges while
smaller than the two giant schools still were colleges
with remarkable histories and excellent faculties pro-
fessor chenenko was there old yet remarkably alert
both mentally and physically dr albert johnson was
there decidedly worried and closely guarded by two
plain-clothes men

  the study contained nine windows in each was a

amazing stories

stained glass with the picture of one of the nine muses
through the colored glass the rays of afternoon sun
came sprinkling the oaken floor with splotches of vari-
colored beauty silence covered the gathered men like
a sullen sunset after a tempest the fact that no one
except jacob hubler knew the real scope of the meet-
ing filled all with anticipatory excitement

  gentlemen that worthy began you are invited
here to listen to one of the most amazing stories that
it has ever been the fortune of a group of educators
to hear as you well know for many years there
has been a sharp and unpleasant rivalry between the
universities of new york and chicago this rivalry
caused intense feeling at the annual football games and
finally in a fight after a game several of the chicago
men were killed i need not say this was an occurrence
that pained us all greatly and we tried in every way
to atone for it but in vain the feeling between the
two colleges was now one of hatred of the worst kind
peter bowlers the multi-millionaire was the leader in
this song of hate he paid a scientist one million dol-
lars to infect the entire faculty of new york with a
new and deadly poison a form of cancer a malignant
sarcoma which would kill in several months the man
who did this who so prostituted his profession dr
albert johnson is with us today

  as a result of his activity the entire faculty includ-
ing myself developed this sarcoma malignanta we real-
ized that we were fatally infected we also believed
though we fought against the idea that in some way
the chicago university was behind our trouble just
then professor chenenko came to us from russia he
proposed the amputation of the entire body of the
sarcoma victim and the keeping of the head alive by the
means of artificial circulation and synthetic blood in
desperation we all submitted to this operation and for
the next eleven years our heads taught and lived while
our bodies molded away in the burial place that we had
prepared for them

  thanks to the power of the synthetic blood we
lived even though we were but a small fraction of our
former selves the part that lived was the intellectual
part while the part cut off was simply so much useless
baggage the men in chicago began to age and die but
we seemed to have developed into eternal pro-
fessors the efforts of the paranoiac bowlers and
the criminal biologist johnson did not succeed new
york continued to lead in educational fields

  you will not believe this till you actually see me
this body under my head is simply a dummy later
on professor chenenko will show you the exact
mechanism that has kept my head alive all these years
and the manner in which i have been supplied with air
so that i have been able to talk and lecture to my classes

  bowlers was furious and became more paranoiac
than ever he finally engaged detectives and they
found out the real condition then he again sought
the help of dr albert johnson he offered him a mil-
lion if he put my faculty out of commission johnson
went to work on the problem he knew that the fluid
forced through our brains was a synthetic blood in
disguise he visited our workroom and finally became
acquainted with one of our best technicians the un-
fortunate man was in debt his wife was ill and he
needed money johnson bribed him and as a result
was able to place an enormous quantity of adrenalin in

a new lot of synthetic blood which they had found

  that blood was used the next day throughout
the brains of our best men in fact through  of our
professors this serum heavily charged with adrenalin
circulated in order for you to realize the result i must
explain to you the effect of this substance in large
amounts it causes small spots of decay necrosis in the
arteries of the normal body these areas of necrosis
either break causing hemorrhage or they calcify re-
sulting in arterio sclerosis or hardening of the walls of
the arteries within a short time many of our best
men died of apoplexy and those who lived developed
the mental symptoms of arterio sclerosis so rapidly that
they became useless as teachers

  fortunately or not i escaped ever since my oper-
ation professorjhenenko has trusted no one to make
my synthetic blood except himself as soon as he per-
formed autopsies on some of our dead friends he sus-
pected the work of an enemy and an examination of the
serum showed what had been done

  however we should never have fully known the
truth had not peter bowlers been seriously injured
realizing that he was fatally hurt he felt that he coulcf
not die with this load of sin on his conscience he made
a complete confession and signed it a few hours before
death it is so fantastic so impossible that if it were
not corroborated by the actual facts we would not be-
lieve it as a result of this confession we arrested dr
albert johnson and will charge him with over one hun-
dred and thirty murders have you anything to say
dr johnson 

  but that man realizing that there was no hope had
placed several drops of a deadly poison on his tongue
for this reason he neither tried to defend himself nor
was he ever punished for his crime after the excite-
ment caused by his death had passed over president
jacob hubler resumed the thread of his talk

  thus we come to the end of the two great facul-
ties one of which died of old age and the other through
the hatred of an insane man back of all of our
trouble have been jealousy and hatred two of the
greatest curses known to mankind working in har-
mony with each other we might have done much
might have inspired a younger generation and grace-
fully made way for their advancement to fill our places
that will have to be done now i asked the presidents
of our sister colleges to be present because i wanted
them to realize what unwise and unchecked competition
would result in such emotions should have no place
in the intellectual life and are certainly out of place
in the curriculum of a university i want you all to
live at peace to be generous with each other each of
you has a definite share in the work of educating our
youth perform that work in loving kindness

  and now i have a peculiar statement to make to
you my family is all dead for years i have been
tired of this stationary life while my colleagues
lived we would be moved near each other and secure
happiness from talking over old times but most of
them are dead and those who are living are so crippled
that it is sad to see them i am taking advantage of an
article of the agreement made years ago we thought
that we might form a faculty of eternal professors
but i am the only one left who is able to retain and
express his intellectual processes i gave orders this
morning to professor chenenko that all the pumps be
bartons island



stopped my professors are now all dead perhaps in
that sense but only in that sense can they be called
eternal i will now close my eyes and smiling ask the
professor to stop my pump

  with streaming eyes professor chenenko pressed

the button life faded from the beautiful face of the
last of the new york professors who had lived so
many years in a state of bodiless perfection

but his wishes were respected and so ended a destruc-
tive campaign for college supremacy

           the end

   concluded from page 

  can you forgive me philip  he asked beseechingly
i have been wrong all these years but illatone
never fear

  yes replied philip solemnly i forgive you
carter

  jerome carter capered like a boy he shooed the
physicians from the room and almost hugged president
haven when his eyes alighted on the gray-clad figure
of kirk paulson he shamefacedly extended his hand

  kirk grasped it without hesitation and carter beamed
his pleasure thank you sir he said you give
me hope that those of the gray will forgive me also
and they shall never regret it things are to be differ-
ent in our country from this time forth

  president haven stared in amazement as the trans-
formed carter turned to him with a sudden remark
mr president he said do you think we could put
an act through congress within the next few days can-
celling the debts of the foreign nations

  why-why-i believe so replied the president in
wonder

  good said carter lets get together on it at
once and i have many other things in mind now
please all of you leave me i wish to dress


later in the evening after the members cf carters
council had been restored to consciousness philip
barton addressed a huge meeting in the auditorium of
the multitude in gray-the new york gathering place
the hall was jammed to the doors and a full hour was
needed to restore order after the thunderous applause
was started that greeted the appearance of philip and
kirk hidden by a screen on the platform sat jerome
carter at kirk paulsons side was the little figure of
aline sarov the applause from the central and west-
ern meeting places came through the loud speakers
with volume equal to that of the local hall and it re-
quired as much effort to silence the distant crowds as
it took to quiet those in new york

  friends spoke philip when quiet was obtained i
have great news for you there is now in preparation
a bill that will be introduced in congress within the
next few days this bill will provide for the cancella-
tion of the war debts of the foreign powers and will
thus permit of their rehabilitation that is but the
beginning we have all hesitated in the past to admit
that our great nation has been under the absolute dic-
tatorship of jerome carter though we have known and
recognized it for years and i am here to tell you of

the radical change of heart of this great man he has
this nigjjt agreed to increase the monthly credit of all
workers by twenty-five per cent this is to take effect
at once and a further increase will follow as quickly as
arrangements can be made all corporation presidents
have already agreed and the matter is definitely settled
further reforms are to follow with all possible speed
the powers of the red police are to be curtailed and
their numbers reduced by seventy per cent only those
needed for traffic regulation and the like are to remain

  housing conditions will be investigated immediately
and all of you will benefit greatly by improvements that
are to be made in this respect educational institutions
are to be opened to wearers of the gray and new ones
will be provided as rapidly as mr carter and his asso-
ciates can obtain material and recruit labor all class
legislation is to be repealed the president has agreed
to use his influence in conjunction with carters a
special election will be held as quickly as the machinery
can be set in motion and the votes of all maj- be cast
without fear of retaliatory action by those of the purple
or the red police you may replace any government
official you desire and may elect whomever you wish
to office from this time henceforth and now i have a
final surprise for you

  a deathly stillness fell over the hall and the two dis-
tant meeting places as philip advanced to the screen
and when he led forth the purple-clad figure of jerome
carter the resulting din eclipsed that which had
greeted him and kirk paulson

  philip seated himself beside kirk and aline as carter
advanced to the center of the platform and waited smil-
ingly for the quiet that would permit him to speak
wonderful isnt it  asked philip

  marvelous agreed aline without relinquishing her
hold on the strong hand of kirk but when do we
leave again for bartons island

  philip laughed heartily at her remark as he watched
jerome carter vainly striving to make his voice heard
above the clamor of the emancipated workers

  and on the streets and through all public and private
newsspeakers there spread the astounding news there
would be very little sleep that night in all north amer-
ica for already celebration was in progress the like of
which had never before swept the country

  in the executive mansion president and mrs haven
were happier than they had been in seven long years
mona thrilled with love and pride at thought of the
great accomplishment of her husband

amazing stories

that it seemed to be as phil claimed it was just dead
so far as vibration or its ability to combine with other
elements was concerned this strange metal was only
one of phils many discoveries and i describe it only
because it was used in his two-dimension experiments

  philip tulane was undoubtedly endowed with one of
the greatest scientific brains that i ever knew he could
have made a name for himself in either chemistry or
physics if he had been willing to accept some of his
flattering offers from various universities but he pre-
ferred to remain an instructor in mathematics at
bennett and i am sure that theda was the cause of
his preference

  theda derioux was as good in her field as phil was
in his she was interested in hypnotism and psychic
phenomena not only had she studied and read widely
along these lines but she was born with strange medi-
umistic and hypnotic powers furthermore she was
gifted with the power of premonition i dont know
much about such matters but theda was a puzzle even
to the psychologists whether it was due to a highly
developed intuitional sense or whether it was the up-
rush of the subliminal or some other power not yet
understood i do not know but theda did marvelous
things in telepathy and mind control without-she de-
clared-knowing how she did them outside of her
mysterious powers theda was a typical specimen of
vivacious charming american girlhood she got her
rather unusual name from her german-french an-
cestry she was a perfect titian blonde and not at all
the type usually associated with the so-called occult
sciences

i must confess that i was very much in love with
theda but what chance had i a bald bachelor of
forty-five  i dont mind admitting my love for theda
at this late date but at the time i kept it well concealed
nobody could doubt that she and philip tulane were
made for each other they were not what you would
call twin souls but rather complementary personalities
-she with her psychic powers and he with his great
scientific mind

  thedas father old dr derioux head of the psy-
chology department was a native frenchman and one
of the most original characters on the campus he
knew his complexes and behaviourisms and he had
carried on a lot of valuable investigations in spiritualis-
tic fields with the aid of his daughters peculiar
powers but like his daughter he managed to retain his
charming personality in spite of his great learning and
outside of his work hours he was so full of inconsisten-
cies and unique sense of humor that he was irresistible

  i doubt if phil knew the first principles of courting
a girl assuming that he had such intentions he did
not seem to want to be alone with theda so he and i
got into the habit of calling at the derioux home at least
one evening a week the four of us had enough com-
mon individual interests to make our weekly sessions
very enjoyable we discussed all the sciences and even
religion and the destiny of man and such things true
the discussions of religion and metaphysics were rather
in the form of a debate with theda and the doctor on
one side and phil and me both rank materialists at that
time on the other

  very clearly i remember the night when the idea of

segregating the dimensions came up for discussion
the conversation had drifted around to the fourth di-
mension a favorite theme with us and each had a
different opinion as usual the doctor much to phils
annoyance upheld the superiority of his own sciencf
over what he called the material sciences

  the fourt dimension declared dr derioux is
not found in ze limited sciences of matematics and
physics dey must be content to deal wit tree while
ze fourt comes in my own realm of metaphysics all
matter have lengt breadt and tickness nossing
functions in ze fourt except ze subconscious mind i
will explain further if you weesh

  you need not take the trouble oi my account
rather testily spoke up tulane i am very well content
with three i think it is rather foolish to seek for the
fourth until we knojv something more about the three
than we can now conceive of

  i think so too agreed theda everything else
goes in threes why not dimensions as for me i
dont believe in the existence of but three on this earth
and have you ever thought of the expression of the
spiritualists the higher plane where we are sup-
posed to exist after death isnt it possible that un-
knowingly they have expressed the real truth about
the next state of existence what i mean is that the
next existence is really a plane existence an existence
in two dimensions i can believe that with one dimen-
sion dropped we might continue to exist without any
real mass we would be like the actors on a moving
picture screen except that vve would retain our con-
sciousness we would be free from all the physical
discomforts that go along with a three dimensional ex-
istence

  a very nice play on words ma cherie the old
doctor replied in an indulgent manner but perfectly
absurd from eizer ze viewpoint of physics or philoso-
phy i have heard ze claim zat a moving picture or a
shadow on ze floor were true examples of a plane but
zat is false ze objects on ze screen or ze shadow are
non-existent in reality and our impression of them is
simply formed by the different intensities of light which
striking ze retina of ze eye stimulate ze nerve endings
so zat dey transmit a message to ze brain which forms
a mental image which says moving picture of john
barrymore making love or shadow on ze floor
that is very good metaphysics smilingly replied
tulane but it leads directly to the theory of the ideal-
ists who claim that nothing exists outside of the mind
i am not quite ready to agree that all matter is the
creation of the imagination for the sake of thorn-
dyke and me who are mere materialists let us please
confine our discussion of dimensions to the mathemati-
cal or physical viewpoint

  in zat way objected the doctor you will hav ze
advantage of ze argument but you are my guests i
will agree to ze terms

  i think theda deserves more credit than you give
her for her play on words  tulane went on i
think that investigations of the possibilities of two
dimensions hold more promise than of four for ex-
ample the oft discussed possibility of travel through
space or into a closed box by means of a little jump in
the direction of the fourth dimension i have investi-
gated most of the theories of the fourth dimension and
the dimension segregator



have come to the conclusion that if it exists at all it
may be defined by the word position length breadth
and thickness-and position being all the necessary
qualifications for existence and that being the case
four dimensional objects are in a sense stationary

i was a firm believer in the einstein theories and
wanted to remind tulane that position was only
relative but i sensed that he had something else on
his mind so i did not interrupt

  now if i wanted to traverse great distances of space
or get inside of a closed box without raising the lid
continued tulane rather than seek to use an extra di-
mension i would discard one of the three that i am now
encumbered with

  but den you would be nossing exclaimed the
doctor

  perhaps so agreed phil but assuming that i
possessed the means of dropping one of my dimensions
and becoming a creature having length and breadth but
no thickness i could pass through any known substance
with one exception without meeting with any resistance
so long as the movement was confined to my own plane
furthermore not having any mass i would not be in-
fluenced by gravity or friction once given a start i
could travel to venus without applying any additional
power on the way i could penetrate to the center of
the earth and find out what it is like ah the possi-
bilities of a two dimensional object are almost unlimited
why seek for four

  why indeed snorted the doctor you might as
well seek for four as for two as long as you confine
your thoughts to physical matter and leave out the
psychic side you will have to be content wit tree-no
more-no less but you have aroused my curiosity
you mention a substance that not even your all-power-
ful plane could penetrate

  tulane was aroused by the old mans sarcasm and he
replied with some spirit

  i wish to amend my statement there are two sub-
stances that are impenetrable by any known means
one is the tjrain of a psychologist and the other is the
heretofore useless substance that thorndyke has in-
sisted on calling tulanium

  the situation between the physicist and the psycholo-
gist was becoming rather critical but theda saved the
day by saying

  you two old fossils cut out the sarcasm and explain
phil what you mean by heretofore useless you seem
to insinuate that you have found a use for tulanium
and i have a feeling that it has something to do with a
scheme of yours for getting into the two dimensional
state so that you can go sailing off to venus or down
into the center of the earth like traveling on a magic
carpet if that is so i want passage reserved for me on
the very first trip

  your intuition is almost true said tulane i
dont have a scheme exactly only part of one i am
really working on a lead that i accidentally came upon
while experimenting with x-rays and infra-red and
ultra-violet rays if you three will promise not to betray
my secret i will keep you posted on the progress of my
invention of a dimension segregator 

  theda was enthusiastic i was interested the old
doctor was skeptical but we all promised to keep the

secret and phil continued to explain his scheme for
projecting himself into the two-dimensional existence
in case he succeeded in perfecting his segregator

  if i can perfect this ray that i am working on it
will enable me to segregate one of the dimensions from
the other two two of the dimensions can be projected
on a plane surface leaving the third behind then by
means of a little shove this projection can be slid off-
let us call it a screen-edgewise tulanium will i believe
be the substance to give the shove as it is an abso-
lute solid it will probably be impenetrable even by an
object having no thickness once on its way this true
plane having no gravity pull and meeting with no re-
sistance will continue on in a straight line through
cterniey unless means can be found for guiding it back
to the screen

  my invention is still in the embryonic stage of
course but later i hope i will be able to project myself
on a tour of exploration into regions as yet not visited
by man

  but phil objected theda how will you ever get
back if nothing can stop your outward journey but a
barrier of tulanium

  dont worry about that i have not gone yet nor
do i intend to go until i find means of dropping one of
my dimensions not even then unless i can feel
reasonably assured of a safe return

  the hour was growing late so we disbanded for
the night after theda had been promised a hand in the
building and operating of the dimension segregator
the doctor was still skeptical and so was i though
i had great faith in phils powers to invent strange
machines

during the next few weeks phil spent all his
spare time in the development of his mysterious
ray he finally came to me with the news that it was
a success and that it was ready to be installed in a pro-
jecting machine and he wanted me to help in the build-
ing of this machine he explained that what he wanted
was a simple housing for the ray tube light-proof on
all sides except for the opening through which the ray
was to be shot there must be lenses to concentrate
the rays on the desired spot and an electrical connection
for regulating the light necessary for the functioning
of the ray-there must be focusing arrangements etc
it was to be on the order of a moving picture projector
but it would be of no use without knowledge of the
secret of the segregating ray

  this secret remained with phil i only knew what
i gathered from chance remarks of his

  it is a combination of rays from radium and light
rays of a higher frequency than ultra-violet rays that
are separated from the spectrum by means of prisms
in the tube he said it resembles in some respects
the x-ray but it has other properties the radium
rays tend to disintegrate matter but the other rays
modify this tendency so that instead of being disin-
tegrated an object in the field of the combined rays
simply has its dimensions separated or segregated with-
out in any way suffering permanent disintegration
this was all as clear as mud to me perhaps some-
one who reads this will know enough about such mat-
ters to enable him to discover the secret of the segre-
gating ray


amazing stories

  i built the housing for him and we took it into the
dark room for the installation of the ray and the finish-
ing touches tulane assured me that if a particle of
light reached the tube the dimensions would be shot
out of everything that the rays came in contact with
he had made it in the dark and we assembled the
apparatus in the dark working by touch alone the
presence of the radium made this a ticklish operation

  we finally got the machine completed however and
set it up in a long room over phils laboratory it was
placed at one end of the room with the screen at the
other and in between was placed a platform on which
objects to be projected were to be placed the screen
was made of a dense alloy of phils manufacture it
had been compressed and polished until it was i be-
lieve the nearest approach to a true plane surface that
has ever been achieved of course if examined under
a powerful microscope it would have shown irregu-
larities of surface tulane was doubtful about the
screen but later it proved its ability to serve as a plane
surface even though it was not strictly one it was
about seven feet square

  the platform and the focus of the ray had to be
adjusted so that the field of the beam barely cleared the
surface of the platform and covered almost the entire
surface of the screen at the first demonstration
which i witnessed i found out why this was phil
later confessed to me that he slyly tested out the machine
alone so as not to risk the chance of being ridiculed
by dr derioux in case it proved to be a failure

at the first public demonstration theda the doctor

 tulane and i were present we experimented
with inanimate objects only this time

  tulane operated the projector and explained as he
proceeded

  i will now place this tin can on the platform turn
the current on and push forward the lever releasing
the energy of the ray tube you perceive the pro-
jection of the can on the screen while the can itself
has completely vanished what has really happened
is that the peculiar energy from the segregating rays
has separated two of the dimensions from the third
these two are stopped by the screen while the third
remains on the platform

  humph snorted the doctor dere is nothing on
ze platform

  just a minute doctor calmly replied tulane
the mere fact that there is no light received on the
retina of your eye which creates an impression on your
brain which says tin can on the platform does not
necessarily mean that there is nothing there i will
prove to you that there is something there in fact the
greater part of the tin can remains with the single
dimension

  i will now reverse the lever which releases the
effect of the ray on the tin can you see the two
dimensions have returned

  it was indeed true the can was removed and one
by one and several at a time other objects were put
through the same process

  but what is ze benefit of all zis demanded the
doctor i do not believe it is a ting but some of
tedas sleight-of-hand or a simple exhibition of hyp-
notism

  ignoring the skepticism of dr derioux phil con-
tinued 

  the most valuable discovery i have made so far is
the answer to the question i have been asking myself
what happens to the weight of the three dimensional
objects when the dimensions are separated  i reasoned
that a two dimensional object could have no weight
being without thickness and i also reasoned that a
one-dimensional object could have no weight multiply
nothing by nothing and you get nothing then where
does the weight come from i was wrong about a
one-dimensional object being without weight i have
found that the weight-the mass-the property of
being affected by the pull of gravity is inseparably
bound up with one of the dimensions which one i
dont know for up to the present time no means has
been known of distinguishing between length breadth
and thickness except the arbitrary custom of calling
the longest dimension the length the next longest the
breadth and the shortest the thickness

  what i do know is that the dimension that remains
behind when the other two are projected retains the
attraction for other matter which is responsible for
the pull of gravity this dimension which is linked
up with mass i shall hereafter call the third and i hope
in my future experiments to determine which proper-
ties are linked up with the other two i shall then give
them distinguishing names

a cube of wood was then undergoing projection
you can learn for yourselves that the weight of this
cube of wood remains on the platform even though it
is invisible not only that you can actually feel the
third dimension with your hands

tulane pulled the lever into neutral the
image remained on the screen the block was
still invisible but the power of the rays was
prevented from any further projection of objects
which came into their field one by one we felt
the third dimension of the block and even lifted it be-
tween our hands it appeared to retain the normal
weight it was a strange experience you could pass
your hand through the spot where the cube had been
in a vertical direction ot from side to side and en-
counter nothing but when you brought your hands
together in the direction of the projection when they
were about as far apart as the thickness of the cube
they would come to a stop and by pressing your
hands against the cube and lifting you could actually
raise the block or rather the third dimension of it and
feel the weight it is not much wonder that people
thought me insane when i related these experiences
yet it was actual fact

  we all moved away from the platform and phil
pulled the lever into reverse and we got another
surprise instead of the cube we now saw a most
peculiar form it would have to be called a cube but
there was not a right angle in it it looked like the
attempt of a lunatic to form a cube even phil showed
a look of blank amazement then he laughed

  now you see some of the possibilities of my
machine he said turning to dr derioux i shall
produce an entirely new set of geometrical figures and
perhaps develop a new school of futurist sculpture by
subjecting old-style statuary to this process
the dimension segregator



  but what in the world happened  asked theda

  i will let you figure that out for yourself enigmat-
ically replied phil

  i guessed what had happened but i dont believe
theda or the doctor did phil placed the new
geometrical form on a shelf and placed a little plaster
bust of shakespeare on the platform and turned on the
ray dr derioux must have had a curiosity to feel
the third dimension of shakespeare he made a
move toward the platform and reached toward the
position of the invisible bust tulane hastily jerked
the switch into neutral just as the hand of dr derioux
had entered the field of the ray the image of the
hand appeared on the screen beside that of the bust at
one extreme edge of the screen

  the doctor looked silly and hastily put his arm be-
hind his back but theda made him withdraw and
surely enough his hand seemed neatly severed at the
wrist there was no blood and he declared he felt
no pain theda and i were filled with consternation
and i thought phils bit of wit was quite out of order

  another possibility of my machine he said pain-
less surgery without anaesthetics

  he was evidently perfectly confident of his ability
to restore the hand but at the next turn of events he
was the most disconcerted person in the group at
this very instant the midnight express passed on the
track not a hundred yards from the building the
whole room shook with the vibration and we saw the
projection of dr deriouxs hand tremble slightly on
the screen and slowly float off the edge and disappear

  oh wailed theda its gone out into space and
it will keep right on through eternity unless it meets
up with a barrier of tulanium somewhere

  which is quite improbable calmly remarked the
doctor

  phil was speechless absent-mindedly he appeared
to give the third dimension of the shakespeare cast a
little twist and then pulled the lever re-aggregating the
dimensions what appeared was indeed a wildly fu-
turistic-looking piece of sculpture still apparently
much disturbed phil placed it on the shelf and then
found his voice to declare

  the wandering away of the two dimensions of your
hand was due to my carelessness in not surrounding
the screen with a rim of tulanium as i intended to do
before performing any experiments it will be neces-
sary for me to project myself into the two-dimensional
existence in order to restore your hand to-morrow
night i shall make the attempt if it costs me my life
nonsense shouted the doctor you will do
nossing of the sort i have enjoy ze seance very much
indeed i tink teda and i had better be going as it
is late evidently he still thought he was the victim
of some sleight-of-hand trick performed by theda and
tulane

 remained with phil after the others had left
he was evidently much disturbed about the doctors
hand

  i havent the slightest idea of how to proceed to
get it back he told me it was simply criminal negli-
gence on my part to have delayed surrounding the
screen with tulanium i intended to do that before i
projected any objects of value whose return to the three-

dimensional state was imperative i must do some
thinking in order to figure out a way to project myself
with at least a - chance of returning

  surely i protested you are not serious in your
determination to allow your dimensions to be segre-
gated and sent wandering in space the loss of a
hand is a small matter compared to the risk of losing
one of the worlds most able scientists

  thanks for the compliment he replied i dont
intend to do anything rash i promise you that i will
remain in possession of all my dimensions until i ex-
periment further and find a way of controlling the
wanderings of the planes in space so that they can be
brought back to the screen butt has been my inten-
tion from the first to use the segregator for the pur-
pose of exploring space and the interior of the earth
but i protested even if you can enter the two-
dimensional state and wander off and return you have
no reason to believe that you will retain the faculties
of perception without which your explorations would
be valueless

  yes i do have reason to believe it i have a theory
that since the property of mass is linked up with the
third dimension the other properties are linked up with
the other two i have made a guess that sensitiveness
to outside stimulations is attached to one of the dimen-
sions and that consciousness and the ability to think
are associated with the other i believe that i will re-
tain full possession of my powers of observation and
understanding

  but even if you do i argued what you see will be
only a sort of cross section of what you pass through
and of very doubtful value to science

  of course he admitted i dont know exactly
what will happen but i have hopes that i will at least
be receptive to the light rays that are perpendicular to
my plane but we will test out my theories when we
have found means of directing our movements while
in the plane existence i want you to help me to-mor-
row afternoon to put a rim of tulanium around the
screen we will at least prevent anything else slipping
off out of our control

  i later learned about the doctors behaviour in re-
gard to his hand he insisted that he was the victim
of some prank some hallucination brought about by
thedas hypnotic powers but finding that his hand
did not return with the dawn next morning he had
become alarmed and had gone to the hospital and called
for the head surgeon a friend of his

  i desire you to examine my hand he said it
feels rather peculiar it may be necessaire to be am-
putated

  i can picture the astonishment of the surgeon as he
exclaimed

  why man you must be joking or crazy it is
already amputated and a very neat job it is how in
the world did it happen 

  ah msieur le doctaire you jest with me the
hand is not gone it is merely invisible i will permit
you to feel it no not that dimension but in a trans-
verse direction-dere zat is ze way

  the surgeon was dumbfounded and dr derioux
was thoroughly enjoying this experiment in psychology
in a new field he said

  ze case den is beyond ze scope of your branch of


amazing stories

science i will confess ze hand was removed by a
new method of painless surgery witout ze use of
anastetics if you can do nothing for me i will have
it restored by the same means by which it was dimen-
sionally dissociated

  i-i th-think we both must be crazy or drunk
stammered the surgeon but i can at least have the
stub dressed to prevent infection and to hasten healing

  non it will not be necessaire but please do not
mention this little visit to anyone until i have consulted
further with ze painless surgeon who has charge of
ze case

  you need not worry about that i think too much
of my reputation for coolheadedness to let anyone
know that i have been made the victim of such a de-
lusion

  phil and i worked on the projecting apparatus all
afternoon we surrounded the screen on three sides
with a slight rim of tulanium and on the fourth side
arranged another rim of the same material which could
be removed at will by a lever we also arranged a
lever attachment to give the screen a slight jar-to
slide the projection off the screen-phil explained
we also substituted a new circular platform which
could be rotated and marked it off into degrees so that
the amount of rotation could be determined

  now if i can have a conference with theda said
tulane i think i will be ready to step off into the
two-dimensional existence and return i think i can
make the outward trip but i will have to depend on
theda to bring me back

the second demonstration was even more amaz-
ing than the first the same four were present
as before but tulane had brought along several rab-
bits and guinea pigs and theda was accompanied by
her pet fox-terrier gyp this gyp was a noted char-
acter on the campus besides being trained to do
several tricks he was rather famous on account of
being the favorite subject for thedas animal hypnotic
experiments another distinction was his unusual
coloring he was pure white except for his right front
foot which was black his right eye was brown while
his left was a pale green

  tulane assumed his class-room manner and com-
menced his explanation of the program for the night

  this evening we are going to experiment with the
projection into two-dimensional existence of animate
objects with and without psychic control first
guinea pigs and rabbits then dogs and if we find that
these animals can be sent wandering in the flat and
brought safely back to the three dimensional form we
will continue the experiments with the species homo-
sapiens tulanii first a guinea pig thorndyke if
you please

  the guinea pig was placed in position and projected
the movable rim of tulanium was adjusted so that
one edge of the screen was open the lever which was
to jar the screen was operated the image of the
guinea pig moved aimlessly back and forth across the
screen came in contact with the fixed rim of tulanium
and was immediately pushed back across the screen
and off the edge

  where do you suppose he has gone inquired
theda

  oh he has probably gone to seek for the doctors
hand lightly replied tulane

  phil i think you are cruel i shall never forgive
you unless the hand is restored

  i was only jesting explained tulane the guinea
pig is gone from us forever unless some one goes after
him or he happens to drift back accidentally i have
no means of knowing whether the projections keep on
moving in a straight line or whether they move around
in all directions in their own plane thorndyke please
remove the third dimension of the guinea pig and place
it on the shelf with the other specimens

  i had no sooner obeyed his command than the image
of the guinea pig came drifting back upon the screen
tulane hastily jerked the leaer into reverse and the
two dimensions of the guirrea pig came back to the
platform but being unable to find the third where it
had been left had to be content to remain in the flat
you may think i am a liar-but this is one of the
miracles performed by the segregator for which the
evidence is preserved when tulane pulled the reverse
lever there appeared on the platform what looked like
a tissue paper cut-out picture of a guinea pig standing
upright i attempted to pick it up edgewise between
my hands but it passed right through both hands-
proving one of phils theories that a two-dimensional
object could penetrate any known substance without
resistance i succeeded in picking it up by pressing
both hands firmly together against its sides but still it
had a tendency to slide between my hands moving it
about was as hard as trying to carry around a drop of
mercury on a slab of glass but i finally managed it
and next day phil and i mounted it on a slab of alu-
minum and surrounded it with an outline of tulanium
he presented it to me and it is still in existence

but to return to the experiments several more
guinea pigs and rabbits were projected but as
none of them returned to the screen after being slid off
we concluded that the return of the first one was a
mere accident

  tulane turned to the doctor and said

  dr derioux i regret to have to confess that the
material science of physics is unable to solve the
problem of controlling the movements of two dimen-
sional objects i shall therefore have to invade your
field and try psychic control

  theda if you will prepare the subject we will see
what can be done

  theda placed one of the remaining rabbits on the
platform and after stroking it gently and talking to it
in a soothing tone drew back and said she believed it
was under her control tulane pushed the lever and
the projection of the rabbit appeared on the screen

  now theda see what you can do in motivating
the rabbit he whispered

  theda seemed to concentrate on the rabbit she did
not have to speak to her subjects she used purely
mental control the rabbit circled the screen it did
not just slide around it hopped it came to a stop
for a moment and then went hopping rapidly off the
screen presently it returned in the same way but
to make sure theda sent it off and on a number of
times and also made it stand on its hind legs and wiggle
its ears she then announced that she was satisfied

i
the dimension segregator



with her control and when the reverse lever was pulled
the rabbit was again on the platform apparently asleep
theda clapped her hands and he jumped down of his
own accord and went hopping off to the corner of the
room apparently none the worse for his experience

  fine work theda exclaimed phil i think it
will be perfectly safe to venture into the two-dimen-
sional existence under your control

  by the way dr derioux you might ask the rabbit
if he saw anything of your hand while he was gone
dr derioux ignored phils inanity he was so
highly elated over the fact that hypnotism had been
necessary for the traversing of two-dimensional space
that he could afford a little ndulgence

  now said phil shall gyp and i toss a coin to see
which is to have the privilege of the next trip  theda
i will leave it up to you if you think gyp is tooi
valuable to risk i will excuse him and go myself
theda looked hurt and replied very seriously

  gyp at least has sense enough to know how much
he is appreciated if i was not sure i could bring him
back i would let you go but i want him to have the
experience so hell be next

  phil turned very red under thedas thrust but he
assumed a nonchalant air and requested theda to pre-
pare the subject gyp was easily hypnotized and was
made to perform his tricks on the screen and go off
and return several times

  i want to lift his third dimension requested theda
and see if it weighs as much as it ought to

  so the lever was put in neutral and theda evidently
with effort raised the third dimension of gyp and
declared that he was fully as heavy as ever

  tulane reversed the power and dr derioux gave
one glance at the platform and gasped

  mon dieu tulane what have you done to tedas
dog he looks like he might have picked up another
dimension while he was gone

he did look that way for a fact for instead of a
normal fox-terrier on the platform there was
a strange object that had but slight resemblance to a
dog-and yet it was recognizable as such it resembled
more than anything else an impression of a dog as
it might be given by one of the extreme cubist artists
whose works i have often wondered at tulane was
amused but theda was filled with consternation

  poor little gyp she cried he is ruined oh
phil what can we do

  i think declared phil that he is quite an improve-
ment however if you dont like him i dare say that
you could sell him to a zoo for a fortune as a new
species of animal

  but noticing that theda was on the point of tears he
hastened to reassure her

  dont be alarmed you shall have your dog back
just as he was before thorndyke will you please
manipulate the lever while i revolve the platform 

  i projected the dog on the screen again and this time
it was the distorted image that appeared phil revolved
the platform a few degrees and the normal gyp was
again on the screen but unable to resist the tempta-
tion to have some fun he continued to revolve the
platform the screen image became more and more
distorted until a ninety degree revolution had been

made at that point the image disappeared momen-
tarily to reappear at once it became less distorted as
the revolution continued until the platform had been
turned  degrees at that point the image appeared
normal and i pulled the reverse

  gyp was again on the platform theda joyfully
sprang on him frightening him out of his spell
snatching him up in her arms she began fondling him
and examining him to see if he was all right being
satisfied she turned to phil and said

  now arent you glad that i let gyp go instead of
you how would you like to be twisted all out of
shape as he was

  i would be only too glad to undergo the experience
if i could be rewarded on my restoration with as much
affection as you are bestowing on gyp

  it was thedas turn to blush now she looked con-
fused and said to tulane 

  stop being silly and tell us what made him look so
funny the first time

  instead of explaining phil suggested that theda
examine the dogs feet and eyes thedas two blue
orbs opened wide with amazement as she hastily gave
gyp another inspection and saw that it was now his
left foot that was black instead of his right and his
brown and green eyes had reversed positions

  tulane explained what had happened as follows
the same thing happened to gyp that happened to
the cube in the first demonstration when theda
picked up his third dimension she set it back down at
a different angle from its original position then
when we brought his dimensions together again one of
them was at an odd angle to the other two producing
the bizarre futurist looking animal that we saw all
that was necessary to restore the normal angle of the
dimensions was to project him again and revolve the

  for instead of a normal fox-terrier on the platform
there was a strange object that had but slight resem-
blance to a dog


amazing stories

third dimension to its original position but for the
sake of experiment i continued to revolve the platform
producing the peculiar kaleidoscopic effect you wit-
nessed on the screen you noticed that at the  degree
point the image disappeared that phenomenon needs
further investigation i only know that two of the
dimensions coincided at that point some very inter-
esting possibilities to that

  the maximum distortion was reached when the
third dimension was at a  degree angle to the other
two while when it was completely reversed there was
no distortion you can see that gyp is exactly as he
was before except that his right and left sides are
transposed like the image in a mirror i dont think it
will cause him any inconvenience unless it makes him
left-handed or makes him see things reversed-mirror
vision i believe the psychologists call it however if
theda wishes it i can easily remedy that

  no theda decided i think it will be fun to have
him this way for a while if it causes him any incon-
venience we can re-reverse him later

  well so much for that said tulane the ex-
periments so far have been only the preliminaries to
the most interesting and valuable phase of dimension
segregation-the investigation of hitherto unexplored
regions i am now ready to make the venture in
person

  mon dieu exclaimed the doctor glancing at his
watch it is  a m we must postpone ze grande
adventure until anuzzer occasion

  but objected phil i am anxious to return the
missing dimension of your hand if it can possibly be
found

  dere is no hurry about zat affirmed the doctor
i have been able to get along very nicely without it
i have disprove ze teory zat a frenchman would be
dumb if deprived of ze use of his hands

  we said good night but for me there was little rest
that night in my dreams hideous creatures appeared
with their dimensions all tangled up and i chased
elusive guinea pigs-in-the-flat who slipped through my
fingers and passed at will through my body and when
the day finally came it was some time before my mind
was able to discriminate between what i had really seen
the night before and what had been part of my night-
mares

	 

we all needed a rest after the great nervous strain
of the two previous nights so we unanimously
agreed to postpone the great adventure until saturday
night following

  on that night we met promptly at  oclock and
tulane took charge of the program and proceeded as
if lecturing to one of his classes 

  there are he said many interesting possibilities
of investigation with our segregating ray without the
necessity of projecting myself into two-dimensional
existence for instance by simply repeating the oper-
ation we can reduce an object to one dimension and
find out the properties of the first second and third
and by going another step we can even do away with
dimension altogether of course that is as yet incon-
ceivable by another method of procedure wre should
be able to establish the existence or non-existence of the
famous fourth dimension a new science of solid

geometry can be based on the forms produced by alter-
ing the angle of incidence of the dimensions just as we
did with gyp with shakespeare and with the wooden
cube there are many other fields of investigation
but that can come later i am growing impatient to
be off on the grande adventure and if theda is ready
to cast a spell on me and use her personal magnetism
to guide me and bring me back again i will mount the
platform

  i have not the slightest doubt of my safe return but
realizing the value to science of my chance discovery
the segregating ray i have carefully written down the
formulae and directions for its manufacture i have
also written down some of my theories as well as a com-
plete report of what we have accomplished i intend to
put the papers in a safer place later but at present they
are in the upper left-hand drawer of my office desk
thorndyke i will give you the key you will also find
a properly executed document transferring to you three
equal shares in the ownership of the invention and all
profits that may result from its exploitation in case of
my demise in either the three- orhe two-dimensional
existence

  then to theda he said all right hypnotizer do
your act

  but she was evidently much affected by phils direc-
tions about what was to be done in case of his failure
to return and she absolutely refused to have anything
to do with projection phil argued and pleaded and
finally declared his intention of making the venture
without psychic control then she grew more alarmed
than ever and stated simply

  i am going with you

  the old doctor snorted and fumed nonsense
impractical absurd ridiculous he shouted how in
ze world can you use hypnotic power to guide phil
while you are yourself in ze two dimension explain
me zat if you can

  theda smiled calmly and said i dont know how
i know it but i do know that i can guide phil much
better if i go along than if i remain behind

  nevaire have i seen such a child complained the
doctor you are ze despair of my existence your
mind is incapable of being psycho-analyzed when-
ever you say you know witout knowing how you know
i have learned from long experience to submit to your
inanities i will say no more i tink perhaps you be-
long more in ze two dimension dan in de tree the
old man calmed down and his voice took on a pathetic
note of tenderness as he continued but teda you
must employ ze extremity of caution your old fazzer
could not live if anyzing happened to you

there were tears in thedas eyes as she assured
her fond father that he need have no fears but i
felt strangely sick at heart at the all too plain evidence
that theda would rather spend eternity in the two-
dimensional state with tulane than risk being perma-
nently separated from him

  theda hynotized phil and appeared to go into a
partial trance herself i manipulated the levers and
they disappeared their projections still in the hyp-
notic state appeared on the screen and presently ap-
peared to awake and arise waving goodby they
slipped off the screen from the time they left until
the dimension segregator



their return dr derioux remained in a state of mental
agitation they soon reappeared on the screen but
were gone again before i could reverse the power

  the minutes grew into hours and i felt ready for a
mental collapse under the strain of watching the screen
and listening to dr deriouxs ravings he was almost
a maniac before the image of theda and phil appeared
again on the screen and assumed a stationary position
i jerked the lever and there they were back on the
platform apparently fast asleep theda came out of
the trance without assistance and awoke phil by a
gentle pat without waiting to be questioned she
began at once with eyes shining to relate her ex-
periences

  oh it was wonderful she declared i am more
than ever convinced that the higher plane of existence
after this earthly life is in a two-dimensional world
i cant explain how it feels but i seemed to be wan-
dering around like a disembodied spirit without weight
or any feeling of solidity i had no trouble in guiding
phil and myself i simply willed to be at a certain
place and lo and behold i was there

  but where did you go  and what did you see  i
interrupted to inquire

  yes where did we go and what did we see
answered phil evidently in a very ill humor we
went to that platform and we saw nothing you three
bright ones must think i am a greater simpleton than
i really am not to be able to figure out that all that
happened was that theda put me to sleep and kept me
asleep while you three planned out your little comedy
theda i did not think you were capable of practicing
such deception for the mere sake of preventing me from
risking the very slight chance of not being able to re-
turn but if you will not allow me to make the trip
into two-dimensional existence under your control i
will get some other assistants and go on my own hook
theda was nonplussed and her enthusiasm over her
recent experience died a sudden death but for only
an instant with a soft laugh she declared

  it is i who am the simpleton why of course your
conscious mind would retain no memory of the ex-
periences you went through while in the hypnotic con-
dition the only way you can find out what you saw
is for me to hypnotize you again and make your sub-
conscious mind dictate while some one writes

  a lot of good it will do me retorted phil to have
some one else tell me what i saw and experienced it
wont do anyone any good to enter the two-dimension
existence except for the purpose of making technical
observations of a scientific nature with his conscious
mind

  oh dont be disheartened pleaded theda per-
haps it will be possible to control your movements while
you are in a semi-hypnotized condition so that you will
be able to remember what you see

  but phil was only partially convinced that he had not
been duped and he was in rather bad humor when we
parted for the night

  the next afternoon theda actually did hypnotize phil
and she made him tell all he had seen and felt while he
was in the two-dimensional state dr derioux copied
it all down and it was filed with the other papers in the
upper left-hand drawer of phils desk unfortunately
i was not present at the time and never had an oppor-

tunity of seeing the paper all i ever learned about
what actually took place in the two-dimensional world
was gathered from the few remarks that theda made

the fourth demonstration was a brilliant success
although it was a nerve-racking experience for me
and the doctor theda partially hypnotized phil and
found that he could be controlled and still have a per-
fect memory of what happened to him she insisted
on going with him again so in their trance-like state
they were projected and left the screen in about ten
minutes they reappeared on the screen and theda held
what appeared to be a human hand

  ah exclaimed the doctor ze prodigal has re-
turned it is my long lost hand which now is found
pull ze reverse lever meestaire torndyke zat it may
be restored so dat i can fall upon his neck and embrace
heem

  i was about to comply but on second thought realized
that i had better think what should be done in this case
it was a brain-twister if theda and phil would with-
draw from the screen and leav the hand i might seat
the doctor on the platform and bring back his hand
but suppose the third dimension of his hand was not
in the same position as it had been at the time of the
accidental projection then his hand would be like
gyp-distorted in that case i could project the doctor
and orientate the platform but in getting his hand
back to normal all the rest of his body would become
distorted

  i explained the problem to dr derioux and after
much argument we were about to give it up then the
greatest marvel of all the marvelous events took place
theda and phil on the screen were apparently laughing
at our dilemma i was much annoyed and was about
to bring them back to solve the problem for us phil
seemed to read my mind and held up a restraining hand
and began to engage in a sort of pantomime for my
benefit he pointed to dr derioux and to the plat-
form the doctor mounted the platform taking care
to get on the extreme edge so as not to disturb the third
dimensions of theda and phil i was about to project
him when phil shook his head and pointed to theda

  then would you believe it theda in her two-dimen-
sional form looked directly at the doctor with a pecu-
liar look of concentration in her eyes and he promptly
became unconscious she actually hypnotized him from
the two-dimensional world this proved that full
powers of mind were retained and contact kept with the
three-dimensional world

  i shot him on the screen and then had the pleasure
of seeing a pretty little screen play the doctor stood
at attention while theda very formally approached with
the hand he extended his wrist and theda attached
the hand testing it to see if it fitted she then kissed
him on both cheeks the doctor saluted with the re-
stored hand and phil approached and gave it a vigor-
ous shake they then seemed ready to be brought back
and i pulled the lever and brought them back and
roused them out of their trances

  dr derioux was delighted and jumped around feel-
ing of his hand and making gestures with it and re-
peating over and over that he must go and show it to
the surgeon and when i asked how it felt to be pro-
jected he replied


amazing stories

  i felt nossing i simply went to sleep and when i
awoke my hand which was lost had returned ah let
us kill ze fatted calf and have feasting and rejoicing
but i was about to forget mr tulane where did you
find heem-ze hand

  oh it hadnt wandered far drily replied phil i
found it on the upper plane trying by means of the
french language of gestures to explain to a class of
two-dimensional sophomores the difference between
ego-ism and egotism

  ah indeed retorted the doctor i have no doubt
zat ze mind of my sophomore class of psychology is of
ze two dimension what you call ze two-by-four but
as for ze matematician and ze physicist-his mind is
in ze one dimension it have no breadth no length it
is only in thickness of ze skull dat it is a grand success
after we had laughed at the doctors wit phil and
theda declared their intention of making another trip
of discovery phil had been able to observe for him-
self this time and had made some revolutionary dis-
coveries concerning the composition of the center of the
earth he declared that he retained all sensory powers
and even acquired the ability to see into the dark in-
terior of solid objects and he also was able to remember
what he saw and felt transportation from place to
place and the passing of time were almost instantaneous
apparently because they had been through the earth
and back in a few minutes he even asserted that he
could bring back objects which of course would be in
the two-dimensional form like the guinea pig these
cross-sections though they could not be chemically
analyzed would be of value to science as to where
and how he had recovered the doctors hand he refused
to say any more at present he said that he was
anxious to traverse the distance to venus and probably
investigate that alleged upper plane of thedas so he
insisted upon being projected immediately

  we went through the usual procedure and they were
off dr derioux and i settled down to wait

  the minutes passed rapidly while we conjectured
about the mysterious return of the hand but the time
began to drag as theda and tulane did not reappear on
the screen the doctor became worried and looked at
his watch every five minutes it was the most miserable
night i ever spent my companion went to sleep in his
chair about one a m and the dawn was breaking
when i awoke with a start from a little nap to see theda
and phil beckoning from the screen

  when they were brought back and the doctor was
awakened he flew into a veritable rage

  teda whatever am i do do wit you you will yet
cause my destruction i ain disgrace i am mortify
here you calmly return at daybreak after being out all
night wiz a man who is not your husband it is un-
conventional it is scandalous what would your
mammon say if she were alive

   father dont be silly theda reasoned with the old
man these things dont count in the two-dimensional
world everything is beautiful and pure and the
physical side of our natures is left behind love is on
a higher plane than it is in this world and besides
phil and i have been united in the two-dimensional
world and if you wish it for the sake of propriety we
will be married in the three-dimensional world

  you have been united in the two dimension mag-

nificent  and i suppose the ceremony was performed
by one of those unitarian ministers who deny the tree
dimensions of god yes well it is ze only cere-
mony zat will be performed unless you proceed in ze
american manner without ze consent of ze parent i
dr derioux i take this opportunity to request the
honor of your daughters hand in marriage phil inter-
rupted very formally

  i am surprise i am amaze i can not she is rrty
only one mr tulane it is a great honor but i must
think i am ze old fool ah i have it it is ze grande
romance ze old man lose his right hand-he offer a
great reward for its return ze young knight come
out of ze west he sail out into ze unknown at ze
risk of his life he recovers ze hand and by his magic
power restores it to ze tree dimension ze old man
is filled wit gratitude he say my son as a reward
for your brave deed i will give you ze hand of my only
daughter it is done you have my consent

  and my congratulations i interposed  and thus
happily ended the fourth demonstration theda and
phil were quietly married that afternoon and seriously
declared their intention of spending their honeymoon in
the two-dimensional world

	 

yfter losing a whole nights sleep and witnessing
tv a marriage on top of that we were all rather un-
strung but theda and phil just wouldnt be denied
one little trip into the two-dimensional world so the
next and final demonstration of the segregator took
place on the very next night april nd a date made
memorable by the occurrence of the great bennett
earthquake and fire disaster

  we wont be gone long phil promised we are
thinking of settling as pioneers in the new world we
have discovered and we just want to pick out a spot
for building the floor plan of our two-by-four cabin
bettaire make it larger laughed the doctor so as
to have room for ze little one-by-one or perhaps two-by-
two phils and tedas that are sure to arrive

  theda very solemnly remarked phil i dont think
we had better go to-night i am having one of my pre-
monitions i seem to have the feeling that something
terrible is going to happen to-night i feel as if the
projection machine is going to be destroyed or some-
thing like that

  i hope you are wrong said phil but anyhow if
anything is going to happen i will feel safer in the two-
dimensional state than in the three wont you 

  a strange look came into thedas eyes and i firmly
believe that she knew at the time that she and phil
would never return to our world if they were projected
into two-dimensional existence but she made the
choice she merely said i am not afraid we
will go

  they were projected and lingering on the screen
only long enough to wave farewell were off on their
strange honeymoon while doctor and i tried to make
ourselves comfortable they had been gone scarce ten
minutes when the windows began to rattle and the floor
to tremble slightly under our feet gyp who was
present growled uneasily

  what train passes at dis hour  nervously inquired
the doctor
the dimension segregator



  i glanced out of the window and replied there is
no train it must be a slight earth tremor

  let us hope dat it will be slight said the doctor
i fear zat tedas premonition was correct her pre-
monitions always are correct

  the second shock came stronger than the first the
screen shook and the platform slid a slight distance
across the floor the tremor died away to be followed
by the third-this time quite severe

  mon dieu fairly shouted the doctor what will
happen if ze machine is demolished and teda away out
in ze two dimension wit no way of getting back i
should have forbidden dis mad adventure to-night
tedas premonitions never fail

  at this moment theda appeared on the screen alone
there were tears in her eyes and she was bidding us
farewell dr derioux hastily pulled the reverse lever
but the platform had been disturbed and the theda
that appeared though recognizable and still beautiful
was dimensionally altered and distorted dr derioux
pushed forward the lever and yelled out

  rotate ze platform rotate ze platform to ze
proper degree dere is no time to waste 

  the earth trembling had ceased and i took my time
hoping that phil would reappear i had just got
thedas image back to normal on the screen when she
glided off to her husband waving us a last farewell
then came the severest shock dr derioux was hurled
to the floor and the lights went off

  all is lost wailed the doctor but i hoped that
was not true the shock was weakening and i hoped
that i could get a light and some storage batteries to
attach to the machine i started feeling my way along
i had reached the hall when the floor seemed to rise
about three feet and i felt myself falling through space
i had been thrown bodily down the stairway

  stunned and bruised i tried to collect my thoughts
i had a vague idea that there was some purpose that i
had started to carry out oh yes-the storage bat-
teries but no it was too late for that now the
machine was probably a hopeless wreck there was
some other thought deep in my subliminal mind that
was struggling for consciousness

  the smell of smoke brought me to my senses fire
had broken out in the building what was it that i
must do  oh yes the upper-left-hand drawer of phils
desk i must make a desperate effort to reach it and
save the papers before everything was lost i dragged
myself along and must have reached the outside of the
desk when some falling object hit me on the head
consciousness left me

	 

i awoke with a throbbing pain in my head and
my first thought was for the papers i made an
attempt to crawl on toward the upper-left-hand drawer
but was restrained by the strong arms of a red-cross
nurse who held me on the cot and said

  you must lie still dont worry about the papers
i settled back and tried to connect things i saw that
i was in what appeared to be an emergency hospital
then i remembered the earthquake and fire and i
realized where i was and why i was there seeing the
surgeon approaching i rose up and asked him what had
become of dr derioux he replied

  i regret to say that he perished in the fire that de-
stroyed most of the university buildings after the
earthquake

  and theda and phil-are they still in the second
dimension 

  yes they were lost too he looked at me queerly
and turned to the nurse and said better keep the
patient quiet he seems to be delirious still

  when the fever had gone and i was allowed to talk
as much as i pleased i found that there had been a
severe earthquake that had demolished most of the
university buildings the shock i learned was for-
lowed by a fire which had totally destroyed with the
other buildings phils laboratory office and the room
where our demonstrations had been carried on about
a hundred lives were lost at bennettsville and the
night watchman had betrayed the fact that dr derioux
and his daughter and phil were in the laboratory build-
ing and had not come out this same watchman had
discovered me lying unconscious ju outside the door
he had been attracted by the furious barking of gyp
who had followed me out and refused to leave my side
in spite of the rising heat from the burning building

  the old doctor gone-phil and theda too but
somehow i felt that though their third dimension had
doubtless been destroyed still their other two must be
together and safe and happy and the papers and
formulae and records were all burnt and the machine
was destroyed it was up to me alone to acquaint the
world of the wonders that phil had performed and to
seek to have the secret of the ray rediscovered

  i searched the ruins but found nothing but a hope-
less wreck of the projecting machine the warped and
melted screen with the rim of tulanium still intact-atid
the queer transformed bust of shakespeare blackened
and broken in two otherwise it was unharmed

  i told my story to many but they only laughed at
me or listened in an indulgent manner that plainly
showed that they thought me mentally unbalanced i
exhibited the flat guinea pig and called attention to the
transposed eyes and feet of gyp but i convinced no
one the tales i told them were too marvelous to seem
feasible i tried to get the surgeon to tell what he knew
about dr deriouxs hand but he refused to discuss
the matter my friend dr fitzpatrick the psycho-
analyst was the only one who listened seriously to my
complete story he admitted that he was at a loss to
explain certain things especially gyps eyes but he
almost convinced me that i had been hypnotized by
theda and was made to see things that did not exist

  it was either that he declared or the surgeon
and the physicians are right in thinking that the blow on
your head caused you to be afflicted with a peculiar
obsession it may be only temporary but if i were
you i would refrain from discussing the subject of
dimension segregation because you are only convincing
the world that you have had hallucinations and you are
injuring your reputation for levelheadedness

  i could not have been deceived no the demonstra-
tions were real but like galileo i had to renounce
my theories at the beck of an unbelieving world in order
to save myself i worked secretly to discover the mys-
teries of the segregating rays but i have not the brain
of a philip tulane nor his knowledge of physics

  after promising not to publish it during my life


amazing stories

time i did finally get a signed statement from the
surgeon describing his examination of the hand of dr
derioux while it was in the one-dimensional state and
after it was restored this statement is on file with
the records of the society for the investigation of
curious phenomena in the museum of the same
organization are the bust of shakespeare with the
angle of incidence of the dimensions altered and the
two-dimensional guinea pig this latter has aroused
much speculation it has been examined by numerous
artists who have declared that it is neither a clever
etching nor a painting nor a print nor any other
form of pictorial representation with which they are
familiar examination under the microscope has failed
to reveal that it is anything other than what i claim it
is-a real two-dimensional guinea pig

  and gyp-i adopted him after he had saved my life
he is not here to give evidence any longer but he was
a noted character on the campus of old bennett and
you could find any number of men who were students
there when the old bennett was destroyed and when

the new university was built who would swear that his
eyes and his front feet became transposed about the
time of the earthquake after living to a ripe old age
he departed to what i like to call the higher
plane

  i have never been able to reconcile biology and im-
mortality but as i grow old i begin to have thoughts
about death and what comes after-if anything and
i like to think that when my time comes i shall cast
off my cumbersome third dimension and pass on to that
upper plane where in the words of theda there is
no immorality or convention or scandal and everything
is beautiful and pure and love is on a higher plane
perhaps in that existence she will be able to spare me a
little of her love which was denied me in this world i
hope to find the dear old doctor there and i believe
that phil and theda have been happy there these many
years

  as for me-i am already on the platform ready to
be projected push the lever forward and smash the
reverse

 it has of course been the dream
 of countless scientists to create
 life in the laboratory it is claimed
 that in some slight degree a few of
 these experiments have been success
 ful in recent years it is hard to fore
 tell how much more successful such
 experiments may prove in years to
 come or what attending dangers
 might follow even if these synthetic
 creations remained of negligible size
 instead of attaining monstrous propor-
 tions the danger might even be
 greater-because there would seem to
 be no danger but that is only part
 of the story the rest is of unques-
 tionable scientific interest

 by stanton a coblentz

 author of the sunken world after
  years etc

        it was not by chance that dr emery
 kramm discovered the secret of the so-
 called blood-mite his success was due
 to none of those freaks of fortune by
 which lesser men occasionally stumble upon
 an unexpected treasure for dr kramm was not one
 of those who blunder by inspiration he was one who
 worked with the mathematical evenness and the certi-
 tude of a chronometer hence he foresaw his astonish-
 ing discovery years before he actually attained it his
 entire life in fact had been devoted to the consumma-
 tion of that one goal first as a student in college later
 as a lecturer on the theory of vaccines and inocula-
 tion and finally as director of the bacteriological labora-
 tory of henry elkins university dr kramm had de-
 voted his spare hours to a single object to which he had

 how triumphantly he must have
 observed the freshly created cells
 become suddenly mobile and how
 gratifying when kramms animal-
 cule was seen to split leaving two
 complete animalcules in its place

of creation

 clung with the dauntless tenacity of an oyster adhering
 to its native rock in the face of discouragement of
 ridicule of financial loss of wasted hours too numer-
 ous to count dr kramm had persisted until finally in
 his sixty-fourth year his efforts were crowned with
 that triumph which dinned on the ears of the world
 like a thunderclap

   yet his goal was not one which had never been
 sought before it had been coveted by many an in-
 vestigator of less perseverance and less talent than dr
 kramm possessed and some of these had apparently
 progressed a slight distance along the difficult road but
 in the end all had thrown up their hands in defeat dr
 kramm had been seeking in a word to solve that most
 difficult of all problems-the enigma of life he had
 been striving to bridge the gulf between inert matter




amazing stories

and organic tissue to convert dead clay into mobile
sentient substance nor was he content with the half-
way measures of his predecessors he did not aim to
create a chemical cell with the mere superficial sem-
blance of life he would have scorned to stop as a
certain contemporary had done with fertilizing the egg
of a rudimentary organism by electrical means his
purpose was as uncompromising as his methods were
thorough-going and his lifelong principles were those
to which he himself gave expression on that epoch-
making occasion when he placed his discovery before
the world

  i realized from the first the difficulties of my task
he declared in that learned document which must re-
main for all time a scientific classic i knew the
boundless complexity of protoplasm and the tremen-
dous gulf between dead matter and even the simplest
living things to create protoplasm might in itself
have been a herculean task but i did not allow my
ambition to pause at this point i desired to create
protoplasm with all the essential functions of life and
what are the essential functions of life they are
simply stated and are only three in number respira-
tion assimilation and reproduction to these may be
added a fourth which however is less essential the
power of locomotion if i could succeed in creating
an organism-a one-celled organism-with only the
first three of these four qualities i should have ac-
complished mans age-old dream to give life to pulse-
less clay   

  it will be needless to recount the various steps by
which dr kramm brought this dream to fulfillment
it is well known how as the fruit of years of labor he
produced the gelatine known unromantically as sea-
glue from the distilled essence of a certain marine
plant and how this gelatine when mixed with certain
hydrocarbons and then subjected to electrical rays in a
manner that dr kramm has explained at great length
may be divided into microscopic particles each of which
though but an amorphous mass of jelly displays the
nucleus and the characteristic appearance of one-celled
animals this fact has been abundantly described
but what is not so generally realized is that at this
point there came a delay of ten years in dr kramms
experiments for the cells though they had the aspect
of living things lacked all three essentials of life they
could not absorb oxygen they could not assimilate
food they could not reproduce themselves and
while a faint quivering was observed in them at times
indicating a latent power of locomotion the result was
merely to perplex and tantalize their creator

but it was not long before the sure instinct of
genius informed him what was lacking i recog-
nized he writes that it was as if i had created a
human body but had provided neither nutriment for it
to absorb nor oxygen for it to breathe in other
words the cells were potentially if not actually alive
all that they required was a propitious environment
but how give them such an environment that was
a problem which as the scientist himself states turned
the last hair gray upon his head and planted the
rutted lines of age upon his cheeks and brow tb
square the circle or to learn the secret of perpetual
motion seemed as easy as to find the proper life-condi-
tions for those infinitesimal cells dr kramm immured

himself like a hermit experimenting until his friends
suspected him of incipient lunacy he tried preparation
after preparation from stagnant water to complicated
protoplasmic brews but never with any results not
calculated to make him wring his hands in agony he
did have certain partial successes it is true-successes
that though they would have made lesser men jubilant
were only enough to prod dr kramm to further ef-
forts under certain circumstances he could cause
the minute cells to move through water with a slow ap-
parently voluntary motion under certain other condi-
tions he could induce them to open and to absorb mi-
nute digestible particles and at the same time he sus-
pected but did not definitely know that they could con-
sume oxygen yet he found no means of making them
reproduce and no means of preventing them from dis-
solving and dying after a few hours was the arti-
ficial creation of life after all as futile as the carving
of statues out of snow

  dr kramm does not make it quite clear what it was
that ultinfyately gave him his saving idea perhaps it
was that all things except one had been tried and
found wanting perhaps it was that he arrived at the
solution by an elaborate process of reasoning too diffi-
cult for the unscientific mind to follow at all events
the important fact is that after ten years of fruitless
experimentation dr kramm wrested victory from the
very teeth of defeat and the agency of victory was
something that had he only suspected it he might have
employed from the beginning it was something with-
out which he no less than the organism of his creation
could not have survived it was the very blood within
him for after all else had failed dr kramm found
that the one-celled creature throve upon blood

  with what feelings of amazement and exultation the
scientist must have watched his first blood-culture
under the microscope how triumphantly he must
have observed the freshly created cells become suddenly
mobile move about furiously with every evidence of
life and fling themselves upon the red corpuscles and
what a fascinating spectacle as these new-born motes
absorbed the corpuscles absorbed also the white cor-
puscles that came forth to oppose them and proved
themselves to be fighting particles of no mean ability
and how gratifying when after expanding as a result
of the feasts of blood-cells the nucleus of each of
kramms animalcules was seen to split leaving two
complete animalcules in its place at last kramm had
achieved the seemingly impossible he had created
a new self-perpetuating species

  but even amid the joy of triumph he did not leap
to ill-formed conclusions the caution of years of
slow investigation was still with him again and again
with the utmost patience and care he repeated and
tested his experiment before presuming to give the
results to the world but in the end there could be
no doubt the blood-mite-as his discovery was
popularly called-could not only be produced at will
but would invariably move breathe consume nourish-
ment and reproduce in a culture of blood

the world-wide clamor upon the announcement of
these facts is now a matter of history it is re-
membered how enthusiastically kramms statements
were received how eager and how heated were the dis-
cussions in every cultured circle and how generally the
the wand of creation



dawn of a new scientific era was foretold neverthe-
less mingled with the tumult of acclaim the voices of
the skeptical began to make themselves heard and
many an unbeliever protested that kramms alleged
discovery was impossible and that the doctor was
either deluded or a charlatan hence numerous parties
of investigation-welcomed by no one more than by
kramm himself-began to visit the bacteriological
laboratories of henry elkins university and letters
of confirmation signed by some of the most eminent
scientists of america and europe commenced to ap-
pear in medical journals and even in the daily papers
dissipating the last doubt as to the authenticity of the
discovery    yet it was one of the investigating
parties which by a freak of ill fortune was indirectly
responsible for the unexpected aftermath of dr
kramms discovery and resulted in converting one of
the supreme scientific achievements of the age into the
greatest curse that had ever afflicted the human race

  the exact facts of course remain clouded in doubt
since at the time the error occurred it was not obswved
and consequently we have to depend on memorial and
surmises for our information yet dr kramm stoutly
maintains that there can be but one explanation in a
lengthy treatise which covers the subject exhaustively
he contends that the seed of disaster must have been
sown on the occasion of the visit of the delegation from
the university of bristol    the summer of 
as every one will recall was a particularly hot one and
the heat was especially burdensome on that august
day when the bristol savants made their call hence
it is not surprising that one of them not observing the
warning that kramm had plastered on the laboratory
walls presumed to open a window without the for-
mality of asking permission and this trivial deed
incredible as it may appear was to be the forerunner
of world-wide catastrophe in their preoccupation
with kramms demonstrations none of the professors
at first observed the open window and kramm him-
self did not notice it until to his astonishment a large-
sized fly settled on one of the blood-cultures which
was probably the most inviting morsel in the room
naturally the doctor was annoyed but he himself
with characteristic frankness admits that he was little
more than annoyed he had as yet no anticipation of
the terrible fruit of evil that lay in store and so he
did what any other normal human being would have
done in the circumstances he chased the insect away
and while the creature went spiraling and circling out
into the open he slammed the window with a bang
and requested his visitors to leave it down thenceforth

  and straightway he proceeded to forget the incident
it was several weeks before the thought of it recurred
to him and when remembrance did come it was under
sadly altered circumstances for in the interval
strange things had been happening in the world

  the beginning occurred when one of kramms
neighbors-a man who had always prided himself on
the strength of his physique and on his immunity to
disease-was taken mysteriously ill the malady was
of a type that four physicians in puzzled consultation
unanimously failed to identify it was as if the victim
had suffered from a severe hemorrhage or sudden
pernicious anaemia for while hale and healthy one
day he had become weak as an infant on the next and
displayed the pallor and the lassitude of one who had

sustained a serious loss of blood and yet there was
apparently nothing to explain this transformation no
vital organ seemed to be affected there was a slight
fever but its source could not be traced it was just
as if the sufferer were fading out of life and when on
the third day the sick man sank into a sleep from which
he did not awaken the physicians were as far as ever
from diagnosing the case nor were they greatly
helped by a post mortem which showed no organic
impairment although it did reveal an astonish-
ing paucity of blood corpuscles

had this been the only case of its kind it might
have been recorded as a medical curiosity but
would otherwise have been forgotten but it was
merely the first of a long series a second and even
more sinister manifestation occurred when the wife
of the sick man as well as three of the attending
physicians fell ill with precisely the same symptoms-
and after three days quietly expired simultaneously
one or two of the neighbors took to their beds as if
suddenly drained of their last atom of strength while
in another quarter of the town eleven cases of a similar
outbreak were reported to the board of health by
this time matters were coming to be recognized as
serious particularly since all but two of the first fifteen
victims succumbed

  what was not recognized however was that the
trouble was so far in its infancy as yet the enemy
had fought only a few preliminary skirmishes but
having won the initial engagements it was to launch a
gigantic attack in a hundred places simultaneously
the mysterious death appeared in every part of the
city and in the outlying country districts the people
began to fall ill and die for no apparent reason while
several cases were reported in a town a hundred miles
away always the symptoms were the same ex-
haustion a sudden failure of strength followed in most
cases by speedy decease and always the cause of the
illness remained hidden it was as if the populace
seized by some dark visitation of providence had been
stricken by an unseen hand while man after man
was plucked as a ripe apple is plucked by the in-
visible fingers of the wind and by the time the malady
had spread across an entire state and five thousand
persons had been afflicted and more than forty-five
hundred had perished a wild superstitious terror be-
gan to possess the land no invading army among
all the ravaging swarms that history has known ever
aroused quite the consternation of that unknown pesti-
lence men suddenly became panic-stricken insane
the doors of business houses were closed farm-lands
wharves and mines lay idle offices and factories were
deserted men immured themselves within their homes
seeking to shut out a foe that none the less slyly insidi-
ously intruded or else they took flight but did not
know where to flee while in their mad rush from the
smitten districts they seemed only to lend wings to the
terror wherever they went the disease was certain
to appear within two weeks it had covered the length
and breadth of the country more than one hundred
thousand cases had been reported in the forty-eight
states and the fatalties-which in that period of
horror and confusion could not be computed exactly-
were said to number more than ninety thousand

  even amid the bewilderment and dismay of those


amazing stories

terrible clays scientists were busy ascertaining the cause
of the plague many a valiant young investigator bent
over his microscope at a risk only too clearly realized
felt the feebleness and languor of the disease overtak-
ing him and offered up his life as a sacrifice and
many a theorist hovering aloof from the scene of
disaster evolved hypotheses to account for the awful
visitation-hypotheses which in only one particular
were recognized as sound the malady showed every
sign of being contagious for those that came into
contact with the victims were themselves likely to be
afflicted while the disease spread from an observable
focus precisely in the manner of a bacterial infection
here at least was a clue to work from-and it is unfor-
tunate that amid the nation-wide chaos of the first at-
tack no researcher had the persistence and skill to
follow the hint to its logical conclusion not until the
scourge had gained universal headway and the in-
habitants of europe asia and africa no less than of
america were perishing by the thousands did any man
make the discovery that was to point the way to the
elimination of the pest

during all this time of course no one thought
of dr kramms creation in connection with the
epidemic dr kramm and his creation alike in fact
had both passed from the public mind-until with the
suddenness of a fresh disaster they were recalled it
was an obscure young physician who working in the
laboratory of one of the smaller medical colleges made
the revealing observation peering under a high-power
microscope at a particle of blood from a victim of the
fainting sickness-as the disease had come to be
called-he observed a number of transparent formless
motes which made their way slowly through the blood-
stream and which coming into contact with the red
corpuscles flung themselves destructively upon those
essential cells here manifestly was the cause of the
fainting sickness here was a microbe new to
science yet the manner of its action was evident
enough it was a sort of carnivorous monster that
preyed upon the blood cells and having entered the
circulatory system it would multiply with great rapid-
ity and destroy corpuscles by the wholesale until not
enough were left to sustain life only in the excep-
tional case was the resistance of the body sufficient to
overcome this potent germ

  but whence came the germ  how did it happen that
so formidable and unique a species had escaped all
previous observation at first the investigator found
these questions impossible to answer having no first-
hand acquaintance with dr kramms discovery he
had no means of identifying the new-found mote one
of his colleagues however had been a member of a
party invited to kramms laboratory and could not
fail to recognize the amorphous moving particles that
had constituted the triumph of kramms lifetime

  and thus almost in a flash the dismal truth came
to be understood dr kramm in solving the secret of
life had at the same time lent aid to the emissaries of
death the cell which he had created so laboriously
had turned out to be a disease germ of unexampled
virulence

  but the announcement of this fact important as it
was for a while promised to be barren of practical
results it was one thing to have ascertained the cause

  of the fainting sickness it was quite another thing
to determine how to conquer that cause with set
teeth and haggard anxious faces physicians all over
the world gave themselves to the problem they experi-
mented with toxins and anti-toxins with fumes and
vaccines and chemicals of a thousand kinds they tried
radium and x-rays and electricity and glandular
treatments they battled to find some opposing harm-
less bacteria they flung down their lives in seeking a
means to prevent the spread of the disease-bearer but
all to no avail they did not even know how the sick-
ness was communicated-and their efforts only served
to emphasize their despair all the while like some
malevolent spirit the disease was spreading all the
while it was snatching victims right and left from the
cringing praying demoralized shuddering ranks of
mankind whole tribes were being rnnihilated whole
districts emptied of human life there was scarcely a
community throughout the wide reach of the civilized
world that had not been made desolate there was
scarcely a town or hamlet that had not known the
tears of mothers the moans of bereaved wives and of
orphaned children the sighs of the afflicted and the
dying and the lamentations of the long funeral pro-
cessions after three months the human race had
been decimated and still the pestilence with long
octopus-like tentacles was reaching out blindly de-
vouring and devouring and devouring   

  it was by ironic justice that the man innocently
responsible for the disaster should have been the one
largely instrumental in checking it dr kramm over-
whelmed at the knowledge that his intended gift to
mankind had turned out to be a curse had been giving
exhaustively of his days and nights in the attempt to
discover some remedy and from the beginning he
worked on original lines how he asked himself had
the blood-mite come to be scattered abroad  he had
done his best to keep all the cultures safely within his
laboratory and it was inconceivable that his visitors
should have borne any of the cells away since none had
come into direct contact with the cultures what then
was the explanation in a startling flash of revelation
dr kramm recalled the incident of the open window
and of the fly settling on the blood-culture was it
possible that the insect had carried away some of the
animalcules on its foot-pads and that they had multi-
plied until they gave birth to world-wide pestilence
knowing how rapidly all one-celled organisjns multi-
ply knowing also how efficient flies may be as the
agents of disease dr kramm was not one to scoff at
this notion instead he set out immediately to test its
validity he found that a fly which he encouraged
to settle on a culture of the blood-mite did indeed
bear away the cells by the thousands he found more-
over upon examining hundreds of flies caught at ran-
dom that in three cases out of four the creatures were
carriers of the dread disease furthermore his
necessarily hurried investigations did not reveal any
other insect carriers of the disease

it was therefore apparent to kramm that the flies
while themselves immune to attack had been the dis-
seminators of the epidemic laden with germs gathered
from contact with the saliva the excrement or even the
skin of the victims they had settled upon food as a
result of which the germs had been transferred and
found means of access to the human system this was
the wand of creation



all simple enough and quite in accordance with find-
ings in regard to other and less vicious diseases and
at the same time the remedy was obvious guard
against flies shun them as if they were venomous
serpents eat no food with which they came into con-
tact  war upon them as upon man-eating tigers this
warning flashed from end to end of the world upon
kramms urgent request was translated into every
language was posted in every town and village of the
earth was dinned and dinned into the ears of the
people by medical advisers and lay speakers alike for
only if these orders were followed was there any hope
of saving mankind   

  time has justified dr kramm the two years since
the outbreak of the plague have witnessed its almost
total suppression once men began to guard against
flies once they began to shield themselves in terror and
loathing from the little winged menace the fainting
sickness commenced to wane for a while to be sure
new cases by the thousands continued to appear but it
was not long before the numbers had diminished ap-
preciably and the blood-mite denied means of access

the

 to the human system began to return to that oblivion
 whence it had issued but the toll it took was suffi-
 ciently severe it will never be known positively how
 many lives were snuffed out but conservative estimates
 place the loss at two hundred millions-a more deadly
 toll than that of any war ever waged-while even to-
 day in some outlying district when caution is relaxed
 an occasional stray case of the disease is reported but
 it is believed that even such rare cases will eventually
 be averted and that the blood-mite will soon be no
 more than an interesting scientific remembrance

   none the less a certain rumor now current cannot be
 disregarded it is said that the governments of the
 world harboring secret cultures of the germ are
 planning to use it as an instrument of aggression in
 the next war-and to scatter it by a new-found means
 much more effective than that presented by the fly
 one trusts however that such reports are mere fabri-
 cations it would be too ironic if dr kramm in his
 successful search for the secret of life should have
 placed in the hands of his fellow men the means of
 driving human life from the earth

a new interplanetary serial in two parts - part 

out of the void

by leslie f stone

what can be more stimulating to the imagination
than a trip through unexplored space man has
been going higher and higher in the air and there seems
little doubt about his ability to reach the outer atmos-
phere some time and perhaps even venture into the
vacuum many lives will probably be lost in the attempt
-but the realization is hardly beyond the pale of possi-
bility this seems particularly feasible since the discovery
by the westinghouse people of permalloy that new metal
which tends to neutralize gravitation

the narrator starts on a fishing trip

he possibility that life is sustained upon a
number of our sister planets has changed
to probability but we on earth have as yet
had no conclusive proof that such life is to
be found on other orbs there has been
talk of sending a man to the moon by a rocket and we
hear much about radio-telegraphing to mars yet up
to the time of these events of which i am writing none
of our scientists had taken seriously the possibility of a
visitor reaching earth from another planet

  neither had i

  i am not a scientific man in fact i am not even a
radio fan to me the moon is an appendage-an inter-
esting appendage to be sure of this good old world and
the stars are there to relieve the monotony of the night
sky it doesnt matter to me whether the earth is
round whether it moves around the sun or whether
there is life on our sister planets or not i offer these
introductory remarks because i want it understood that
this is being told from a laymans viewpoint-from a
disinterested laymans viewpoint i have no theory or
explanations i have only cold bare facts

  i am one of those beings usually designated as the
t b m i go to the shows whose patronage depends
largely on that class of man and like a great many
brethren i am a devotee of the art of fishing this is
not a fish story however though it has its beginnings
in a fishing trip

  it was on one of those rare occasions when i slipped
away from the turmoil of wall street to my own par-
ticular fishing lodge a ramshackle little hut on the bank
of one of the finest trout streams in the east bar none
that i had my adventure

  that afternoon i had telephoned the wife that i
would not be home for dinner for three or four nights
catching the last train out i was soon disembarking
at my wayside station i carried nothing but a small
grip containing my necessities and my beautiful fishing-

  and perhaps this talk about the impossibility of crossing
the vacuum is only a legend-more or less like the talk
that was rampant in the days of columbus about cross-
ing the ocean it seems ridiculous to us now but the
same may some day hold true of interstellar travel

  in the first instalment of this story the author gives
us excellent description not only of the sphere which
makes the trip but of the great void through which it
travels too out of the void easily justifies the favorit-
ism which is showered on interplanetary stories

rod walking briskly i left the confines of the tiny
new jersey village and plunged into the dense woods
that hedged in my shack

  it was already night and i hurried for i had the
city mans fear of the dark i met no one though once
or twice i had the sensation that the woods were full of
spying men once through the trees i saw the gleam
of what appeared to be the eyes of a cat or a wolf
but i laughed that off realizing it could be no more
than two fireflies

  i hurried on my way whistling then my furtive eye
caught the gleam of glass ah thought i a new
neighbor i resolved that i would pay him a visit the
next day the shack was reached at last and with
hands trembling with joyful excitement i pushed open
the door i lit the oil lamp filling it from a tin i kept
for that purpose the night was warm and i needed no
fire i busied myself in making the place habitable

  it was about five minutes later that i discovered the
theft and the jewel i had always kept an old suit of
clothing hanging on a nail against an emergency such
as a wetting for instance although i always brought
an extra suit of khaki with me now the suit was gone
the suit wasnt worth anything an old-clothes man
wouldnt have given me a cent for it but i did not like
the idea of a thief around my hut what could anyone
have wanted with that suit then i saw the jewel

  there on a small shelf where i usually kept my
toothbrush hairbrush razor et cetera quite close to the
rack on which i had hung the old suit was the most
perfect ruby i have ever seen at least i thought it
was a ruby it flashed and glowed like a thing alive
for several moments i stood there too enraptured to
touch it i knew immediately that the jewel had been
left in lieu of payment for the old suit but what sort
of person would do such a thing to whom could that
suit have been worth a ruby a thief an escaped con-
vict no a thief or an escaped convict would hardly
have considered payment at all

  i went to sleep with that ruby under my pillow and


i we both started to our feet and were unprepared for what followed we were
suddenly plunging toward the ceiling as easily as a feather by putting out a hand
against the ceiling we pushed ourselves downward to the floor

for the first time the door and windows were locked
the next morning i was up early with a tingle in my
blood just outside my window i could hear the song
of the stream as it bubbled and swirled among its rocks
and pools dressing i stopped only for a cup of coffee

  all morning i fished completely oblivious of any
mystery it was not until after three oclock in the
afternoon when i finally went to the shack for some
food that i recalled the ruby that jolt knocked all
spirit out of me i lost every desire to resume my sport
i sat brooding over the jewel it was too strange i
recalled the curses that some notorious jewels had cast
over their possessors this might be such a gem or
again what if the thief had not intentionally left it and
should return 

  hurriedly i left the hut i needed air but the stream
and its trout did not lure me the gleam of glass that

i had seen the night before appeared again the owner
of that glass might know something about this mystery
anyway i needed to talk to someone

  half running i quickly came to the spot where i had
glimpsed the glass there was no mistaking it right
there was the converging of two paths at first i saw
nothing the trees and vegetation hid it until looking
upward i saw the gleam again i thought it was the
roof of a greenhouse wondering who in the world
would build such a structure in this part of the country
i walked toward it

a strange visitor

the country was clearing and i came to the edge
of a large natural open glade where i stopped
short astonishment halted me in my tracks
there in the center or rather almost taking up the en-


amazing stories

tire clearing from one side to the other reposed a giant
construction it was cylindrical in section and of the
same general design as a torpedo except that it had
two conical ends it was fully a thousand feet long and
perhaps fifty feet in diameter

  i did not stop to conjecture about the whys and
wherefores of this strange thing after my first sur-
prise i walked up to examine it it was glossy white
and seemed to have a glass-like finish and it was
opaque i discovered later that it was constructed of
glass but i would not have believed it then i walked
all around trying to fathom its secret its purpose
there was not a single opening anywhere it seemed
to have been made of some highly polished stone and
picking up a sharp pebble i tried to scratch the smooth
surface i pressed with all my might but the white
surface withstood me i could make no mark upon it
and the stones tip was blunted it was then that i per-
ceived that the thing was of a clear transparent material
and the whiteness behind it might be a blind drawn
over it

  since a stone could not scratch it i tried the edge
of the diamond in my finger ring it made not the
slightest impression determined to discover some way
of breaking it i backed away several yards and picking
up a stone hurled it with all my strength the stone
bounced off like a rubber ball

  for all of an hour i dallied around the cylinder
trying to discover what it might be or its purpose in
that spot half a dozen times i encircled it running
my hands over it as low as possible and as high as i
could reach endeavoring to find some weak place on
its wide expanse with much difficulty for i was not
as slender then as i was once nor as spry i climbed to
the top of a young tree to see what lay atop there
was nothing but a smooth unbroken surface my curi-
osity was now very much aroused but i could find no
plausible explanation at last i decided to inquire about
it in the village

  with the chagrin of a baffled man i picked up a
rather large rock as i turned to go and flung it with all
my strength against the thing exactly as a peeved boy
might have done i was startled to hear a deep hollow
boom at least the thing was hollow but the stone
left no blemish in disgust i headed for the village
and then i was frightened by the most inhuman shriek

  it was beginning to get dark it was that time of
evening when the dusk is settling and nothing seems
real in the half light this is particularly true of the
woods it came bearing down upon me a thing of
white that in the twilight appeared to tower over me
many feet a ghost i had no time to think i saw
that it was clothed in flowing draperies that streamed
behind it and in those flying things i saw a face-
if it could be called that it seemed more like a mask
of many colors and distorted features i saw all this
as it descended upon me screaming and in the grow-
ing darkness i saw a pair of eyes that gleamed like the
eyes of a cat

  it closed down upon me-flesh and blood strong and
wiry i could get no hold on it something fell on
my unprotected head and there came a painful black-
ness i recall a hazy awareness of other beings and i
was being borne off toward the white cylinder and
through the walls

  when i regained my senses i was comfortably spread
out upon a wide soft couch a blinding light filled my
eyes and i quickly closed them again i lay there
wondering what had happened to me then like a flood
the memory of it all returned the stolen suit the
strange ruby the white cylinder the attack-it all came
back to me

  i opened my eyes again this time the light did not
bother me i saw that i was in a room-the strangest
room i had ever seen close at hand just below my
couch lay a pool filled with water that lapped gently
at the sides strange flowers of forms and colors i
had never seen before grew in pots around the pool
the flooring was of tiles and the ceiling was of glass
a light seemed to flow from the entire surface of the
ceiling and lit the room with a diffused glow that was
like sunlight the walls of the chamber held my at-
tention

  they were of mosaic tiling depicting a pretty piece
of scenery it was as if i were lying in a valley sur-
rounded on all sides by low tree-covered hills with a
bit of sky above on one wall was a meandering river
with a pretty waterfall and above it was the sun only
it was shown as being relatively about as large as an
apple and half covered by clouds another wall showed
a city of tiny white houses built on a terraced hill the
other walls carried out the hill scene it was above the
city that there was one bit of incongruity that spoiled
the entire landscape it appeared like a second sun yet
almost three times as large as a sun should be and its
color was a pinkish lavender that contrasted strangely
with the greens browns blues and whites of the scene

  after looking about me i sat up and was immedi-
ately overcome with a dizziness and a shoulder that
pained i now looked wildly about for a doorway but
nothing seemed to break the continuity of the tiled
walls i tried to get to my feet finally i succeeded in
standing up i swayed and reeled fell into a dead
faint a second time

when i regained consciousness i was back on the
couch a man was bending over me beyond
him i saw that a section of the wall had opened sliding
into grooves on either side the opening

  do not attempt to rise i heard him say your
collar bone has been fractured so you must move about
as little as possible

  i think i cursed for the blood rushed to my head
a pretty predicament i was in

  the speaker continued i regret exceedingly that
you have been put to this discomfort sir my servant
was over-zealous in performing his duty 

  his duty i exploded do you think it was his
duty to attack an innocent  here i fumbled for
a word

  meddler supplied my host

  i bristled at that and was about to say something
caustic but the surprise i experienced on looking up
at my host-or captor-made me forget my anger

  he was a large fellow standing a good six inches
over six feet with a body perfectly proportioned i
thought of the statue i had seen in the vatican of the
apollo belvedere his feet were small and his hands
were almost as fine as a womans his clothing was
cut to show the body to advantage fitting the legs as
out of the void



tightly as a glove with a smock cut close to the
shoulders and low at the neck and girdled tightly at the
waist

  still it was not his form that struck me so forcibly
it was his skin picture a statue of fine well-polished
silver-silver generations old-radiating an inner lustre
the man was truly a silver man face arms hands
and even hair fine as silk falling to his shoulders were
silvery only the inner flush that glowed under the skin
gave proof of red blood behind that strange complexion
and he had lavender eyes

  i was speechless my eyes strayed about the strange
room to the mans stranger garments and back to those
peculiar eyes at last my tongue came free my
god i cried what kind of man are you a
hundred questions raced through my mind

  we come said the strange man from a most
distant planet of which you on earth are not aware a
planet quite on the edge of your solar system we
have no name for it but abrui which translated means
home however we are concerned chiefly about
the present and must consider this untoward situation

  his words left me oddly chilly a cold sweat broke
all over me i could not think but somewhere some-
thing was repeating over and over again men from
another planet men from another planet i closed my
eyes to arrange my thoughts once more i knew that i
was not dreaming and that this was reality there was
a pain in my shoulder i turned once more to the man
but i dont understand how did you come here
how

  i saw him shrug his shoulders slightly and i realized
he considered me a nincompoop he answered you
are aboard an interplanetary vehicle we call it the
yodvcrl which in your language means the ship of
the void 

  how is it then you speak my language i de-
manded

  that my friend is because i am not the first to
have traveled through space he who went before was
from this your native planet

  i tried to comprehend what he had said but it was
difficult having been penned in by a routine of busi-
ness all my life it was difficult for me to conceive such
possibilities or to follow such a train of thought as this
mans words had opened up for me i saw he was
waiting for me to continue questioning him and now
that you are here what are your intentions  i thought
of what a reception new york city would give this
man lindbergh and dr eckener who had but re-
cently crossed the atlantic from germany in a dirigible
would find their noses out of joint

the secret mission

he was smiling at my question and i had a feel-
ing that he had read my thoughts my mission
here is a secret one i am concerned with noth-
ing of this world except one man to whom i bear a
message we arrived on this planet two nights since
and i hope that by to-morrow night we may be in posi-
tion to make our departure that is after we have re-
turned you safely to this spot he sighed but not i
i wanted to know what he meant by his last words

you sir he explained are luckily the only tres-

passer who has had the misfortune to discover our retreat
here we landed at night and slipped into this quiet
glade without discovery on reaching your planet we
picked out a spot near one of your large cities we
needed some equipment as well as a map by which we
might find our destination fortune led us to new
york which we found by means of its great lights
thence we traveled this far i went foraging and dis-
covered the old suit in the cabin which i take to be
yours and i hoped that its owner would not return be-
fore we were on our way

  when you came to find us it meant but one thing
we had to capture you before you carried your story
to the village and brought intruders here hence you
find yourself within our vehicle and though we re-
gret it we must act so as to insure the keeping of our
secret during our stay on earth you may rest assured
however that you will be returned to this spot safe and
well

  i glanced ruefully at my shoulder it will be six
weeks before that can heal

  on the contrary we have with us a salve which
has a healing power that your medical men would no
doubt consider miraculous your collar bone will be
completely well within a weeks time allow me to
bandage it again and rub it with this salve

  as he worked on my shoulder with his cooling un-
guent another man entered the chamber he was like
the first silvery and handsome but somewhat younger
his knowledge of english was not equal to that of the
older man nor did i take to him as readily as i had to
his companion he addressed my host as sa dak
while the younger fellow answered to the name of tor

  later as i began to notice sa dak more particularly

i saw that his face was one of power while in the eyes
was an expression that bespoke some great sorrow
there was no way to determine his age from his fea-
tures and one could not see gray hairs among the silver

i judged him as a man in his prime probably in the late
thirties or early forties the other had no fine marks
of character in his youthful face and his lavender eyes
expressed no emotions he seemed to me to be no
more than twenty-five years old

  after rubbing my shoulder well sa dak asked if
it still pained there was only the discomfort of the
tight bandage and an ache that was no more than a
slight toothache i admitted as much and felt better
about the prospect of my imprisonment suddenly i
remembered that i had told my wife i would stay away
several days and she should not expect me until i
showed up somehow it never entered my mind to
doubt sa daks word and i was looking forward with
childish curiosity to this strange adventure

  just then another creature entered the room he
was bearing a tray on which there were three glasses
filled with liquid and several dishes filled with food
the servant was somewhat smaller than his master
just as finely built and had an extremely intelligent
face but his skin was different whereas his masters
looked silvery he looked golden hair skin and lips
were like virgin gold polished and glistening with the
blood flowing under the skin and his eyes were red
as red as vermilion and they looked quite natural in
that golden face

  my host on perceiving his entrance said ah here 


amazing stories

is the culprit and rapidly he spoke to the fellow in a
strange tongue the servant cringed his tray trembled
as he looked in my direction he managed to distribute
his burden among us and waited nearby while we ate
and drank what the liquid was i did not know the
food was also strange but was vegetable-like and very
delectable

   after taking the dishes the servant waited patiently
just beyond my couch with fear in his strange eyes
his master paid him no attention but continued speak-
ing to me

  when you appeared in our vicinity we knew im-
mediately that it would be necessary to make you our
captive my companion and i enjoyed watching your
attempt to discover what we were and when you started
away with the thought in your mind of making in-
quiries and possibly to arouse the authorities we sent
this poor fellow out to capture you it was his over-
zealousness in the duty of capturing you that caused
him to wound you hence he is now at your mercy
punish him as you will and with a movement of
his arm he brought the trembling slave into our circle

  i was greatly embarrassed had my captors sug-
gested earlier that i punish my tormentor i would
gladly have taken an eye for an eye giving him the same
that he had given me but the situation had taken a
different turn i who had thought these interplanetary
visitors the intruders was convinced that i was the
intruder i managed somehow to smile though i was
feeling like a bully who was beaten by a smaller fellow
i waved the slave away

  you are to be complimented upon possessing a ser-
vant who performs his duties so fully i said and i
smiled smugly to myself as i thought what a good ex-
ample of my countrymen i was setting myself up as
in so magnanimously forgiving the man who had in-
jured me

  the silver man turned to the golden one and spoke
in their soft language the slave looked at me with his
odd eyes and in the manner in which all mankind ex-
presses gratitude he threw himself at my feet and
taking my hand in his he kissed it more embarrassed
than ever i looked to sa dak for relief he spoke and
the slave slowly backed out of the room it is needless
to say that during the rest of the time i spent on the
yodverl he followed me about like a faithful dog ful-
filling my desires before i had time to express them

  it was now quite dark outside and sa dak observed
that within a short time we should be moving i was
rather inquisitive as to where our destination lay but at
a motion from sa dak the other followed him and they
both hurried away through the doorway

curiosity uppermost again

cautiously i rose to my feet this time i
knew no dizziness and i found that my shoul-
der pained not at all walking to the door i
peered through and saw that a small chamber lay be-
yond at its far side was a second doorway and i
surmised that the two silver men had proceeded through
it to their pilot room

  i glanced about the room it was furnished very
simply with furniture made from a strange light metal
there was a broad desk in the center sitting on a square

rug of gray woven from some rough material like
camels hair several chairs were set about three-
legged chairs with seat and back built to conform to
the lines of the body all about the room were set
square cases three feet in height i surmised that they
contained books although the shelves were concealed
behind metal i noted that the walls of the room were
like the ceiling and the light came from all sides there
was nothing to relieve the whiteness of the glass

   the desk held my attention on it was a tall slender
 metal vase with one of those strange exotic flowers that
 i had seen growing in the other room beside the vase
 were several strange oblong boxes of metal about ten
 inches in length and only one inch in width curious
 i picked one up on one side was a small metal tab
 which i immediately pulled one side of the box drew
 out and to it were attached about two dozen thin sheets
 of metal each one as thin as a sheet of writing paper
 and on them was a strange form of writing the letters
 were oddly shaped and on examining them closely i
 found that instead of having been printed or written
 they had been photographed on the sheet i took this to
 be a book

   besides the several books which were on the desk
 was a square box of metal of course i had no right to
 be prying but i was curious i wanted to know all
 there was to know about these people it would be
 something to remember all my days so without any
 scruples i opened the box and let a cry of wonder es-
 cape me for there on the same sort of metal sheets was
 a manuscript written not in abruian but in english

          to professor ezra rollins
  data concerning the results gathered on
  the arrival of the rollins rocket upon an
  unknown planet called by its peoples
  abrui

  with greetings and best wishes to the
  professor

dana gleason

   i looked no further i closed the box my mind now
 in a whirl dana gleason dana gleason where
 had i heard that name then it came to me years
 ago when i was no more than a boy i had heard
 the story of dana gleason one of the wealthiest men
 in the world of fine aristocratic stock dating back to
 the early settlement of the country

   dana gleason had been one of the young society men
 whose very name brought envy to youthful hearts
 tales of his exploits his polo ponies his yachts his
 globe-trotting were read avidly by the curious public
 his marriage into another house of equal rank and
 fortune appeared on the front pages of the newspapers
 then for two years at which time his baby was born
 dana gleason was completely forgotten almost im-
 mediately upon the arrival of the baby both father and
 child disappeared completely later it was discovered
 that the father had spirited the baby away on his yacht
 several weeks later there came a sensational story when
 young mrs gleason was killed at a railroad crossing
 in an automobile

   for months no more news was to be had but an in-
 quisitive reporter learned that the father had planned
out of the void



 with the aid of nurses and tutors to bring up his boy
 with a hatred of women five years later the last
 woman left the yacht but she had been paid not to give
 interviews next we heard ofthe yacht which was
 almost as large as a small steamship from various
 corners of the world-from the north east west and
 south dana gleason jr was having the finest edu-
 cation that man could acquire the greatest teachers
 from every nation were taken aboard the yacht and one
 heard of the famous men of the day being invited for
 cruises the yacht was said to have a swimming pool a
 gymnasium a chemical laboratory and an astronomical
 observatory it carried its own wireless and motion
 pictures of historical events were screened especially
 for the benefit of the heir the accounts of his life
 aboard the yacht read like fairy stories

  the child grew up and his father and he were heard
of in every conceivable place on the globe they were
exploring the arctic regions they had their fingers in
some political pie in latin america they were skiing
at biarritz they were shooting tigers in india lions in
africa they were at the kentucky derby they were
taking in the night-life of new york they were with
an archaeologist on the nile they were studying condi-
tions in manchuria they were presented at the
russian court they were abducted by arabs they
had attempted to climb mount everest but why
should i write all this you too have read these ac-
counts and reveled in them and envied

  you too can recall when the gleasons joined the
british forces to fight germany and you read the
account of gleason seniors death in the third year
of the war and of the record the son made in the air
force and that was the last you ever heard the
name of gleason was forgotten with the rising of new
stars of front-page brilliancy what happened to the
son after the leadership of the father was gone  was
this manuscript perhaps the answer had dana
gleason jr accomplished the last possible thing left
for him to do 

  i turned again to the sheets of metal lying before me
but as i started to read further suddenly the light
about me began to fade and i was in darkness in
wonder i looked about overhead as through a very
thick glass i could see the stars and close at hand i
could make out the shapes of trees in the darkness
then as i gazed in wonder i saw that we were rising
above the trees soon they were far below and i could
see nothing but the twinkling stars in the distance

  there was no pulsation or vibration to suggest
motors it was only a gentle rising and a feeling of
being suspended in space then through the darkness
of the room i saw something that startled me two
glowing orbs had appeared in the doorway it was my
host he spoke

  in traveling through the atmosphere of a planet we
shut off our lights our light does not travel far that
is why we allowed it to shine in the clearing but it is
enough to be seen from below i trust its absence does
not inconvenience you

  i made some inane remark that passed i enjoyed
watching our progress i added that i regretted i did
not have the power to see in the dark as he had

  dana gleason could never become quite accustomed
to the fact that we on abrui could see in the dark as

well as in daylight he observed and i realized that he
knew that i had found the manuscript

  yes he continued we are on the way to deliver
that report to professor rollins who invented the first
interplanetary vehicle we are bound for africa
come join us in the pilot room

looking over the works

i followed him into the nose of the machine
here the pilot tor sat at some controls all about
us was clear glass below we could see the woods
we were leaving a small light glowed here a small
round globe that contained a light in its center al-
though i could see no connecting wires fastened to it
a shade trained its light down upon a map of the two
hemispheres so that the light could be perceived no-
where else i could see faintly two vertical rods rising
from floor to ceiling upon which were various levers
and meters and with these the young man was working

  on the map was drawn a line from the point which
he had left down through the center of the atlantic
ocean along the equator to africa at a point approxi-
mately three hundred miles above johannesburg and
about one hundred miles in from the coast-line our
destination was marked by a small cross

  a chair was given me and i sat down where i had
a good view of everything around us below we saw
the lights of scattered communities but these quickly
dwindled to single lights of squatters and fishermen
along the jersey salt marshes then the dunes slid
by and the rough waters of the atlantic billowed
how long do you judge this trip will take i ques-
tioned the youth at the controls sa dak had left us
for several minutes

  not more than three ro which equals about four and
a half of your earthly hours he declared

  i was incredulous but the estimate proved almost
correct for we were there in exactly four hours what
would lindbergh say to that

  sa dak returned from an examination of the mo-
tors these engines were located in the far end of the
ship all i gathered from the details that he gave me
was that the power of these motors was derived from
that element very rare on earth-radium

  fifteen minutes or so passed we saw a ship with
its lights all aglow steaming on to new york it was
a pretty sight i wondered what its passengers would
say if they could see us my host suggested that i lie
down for a while for my shoulder was still sore and he
thought it best for me to rest as much as possible he
himself led me back to my couch so that i should not
stumble in the darkness i was tired and the bone was
beginning to ache from weariness the golden servant
soon appeared with a glass of liquid that was strangely
refreshing after i had sipped it the stranger in-
sisted that he must dress my shoulder he rubbed a
salve in with his cool deft fingers then with a salaam
he was gone and i fell asleep

  two hours later i awoke and returned to the pilot
room the two men were still at the controls water
lay below us we saw another ship bound we sup-
posed for capetowrr we quickly passed it by in
another half hour the servant appeared again with food
a sort of cooked fruit i might note here that all the


amazing stories

dishes with which we had been served including those
containing liquids which later i have called glasses
were really of metal like almost everything else the
abruians used

  at last we saw the shore line of africa and after
skirting it for some distance we turned inland and the
wide unvarying veld with its low hills and occasional
groves of tropical trees was below us the moon
had risen very late and now it was shedding its silvery
glow upon everything the skin of the two strange
men caught its light and reflected it

  lights now shone out in two or three directions here
the lone camp fire of some traveler or hunter there the
house lights of an isolated farmhouse then we came
suddenly to a halt hung suspended for several minutes
in the air and like a rocket we shot down toward a
group of three lights that were shining from a low
bungalow and its accompanying outhouses

  it was now one oclock in the morning and the country
lay still quietly for all its bulk the yodverl made a
landing sinking down on the smooth grass several
hundred yards from the darkened house the bungalow
was not completely dark for lights shone from two of
its windows a single light burned in the negroes
quarters beyond

  we have arrived stated my host it is rather
late to be calling but i believe we will be welcome
then turning to his companion he made a remark in
their own tongue and disappeared through the doorway

  that was some voyage i remarked to the youth

  he smiled it was necessary for us to travel at so
low a speed he said quietly putting me in my place
out in space we travel many times faster than this

  i had noted from the start that this fellow spoke
english with more difficulty than did sa dak his
was an english that had been learned book-wise and
he spoke haltingly as he carefully picked each word
sa daks mastery of the language was different with
perfect ease he used our idioms and slang expressions
and never seemed at a loss for a word

  sa dak reappeared shortly he had changed his
clothing and was dressed in a suit of white linen the
earthly clothing could not hide the beauty of his superb
body with its easy natural grace instead it made him
look taller more massive and more outstanding

  the suit i took from your cabin was too small
unfortunately he said but it had to do until i reached
a store where they could fit me properly this is
the only suit they had that fitted me without alteration

  i wondered how he had managed to walk around
the streets of new york without attracting a crowd
but then new york was accustomed to all sorts of
strange people on its streets

  yes remarked the man i did cause a stir of
course i had painted my skin to a semblance of white
and in the first pawnshop i came to i sold several jewels
to obtain money with which i purchased a pair of dark
glasses to hide my eyes but my size continued to at-
tract attention and several people made remarks about
the circus in town he laughed at the memory

  i could not quite accustom myself to the fact that
this man could read my thoughts from the first i had
noticed that he had been aware of what passed through
my mind it was unnecessary for me to as much as ask

a question he answered before i voiced my question
even now he was explaining

  reading anothers mind is merely a science my good
sir your world is coming to it the difficulty in my
world is in keeping the other fellow from reading your
mind my friend here and he pointed to tor as
well as my servant have no trouble in reading what
passes through your brain i have had much pleasure
in learning your reactions to us but let me explain that
human nature is much the same the universe over and
any man of abrui would react exactly as you have done
under similar conditions

  his words made me rather uncomfortable but the
look in the smiling lavender eyes comforted me

the old scientist

 nd now sir he went on would you care
to accompany me on my little visit i feel
that i owe you some recompense for detaining
you as my prisoner perhaps you will be interested in
what is to come the person we are visiting is pro-
fessor ezra rollins a scientist that should hold the
highest place amongst your great men but he prefers
to end his days in this deserted spot shall we go
i gladly accompanied him my broken bone now com-
pletely forgotten

  my idea of how we had entered this craft was that we
had come in through its glass walls my kindly host
now pressed a small lever that was fitted on his desk
top to my surprise a doorway opened where there
had been naught visible but a blank wall the door
was simply a large square section which slid outward
and now rested on the grass outside there are forty
layers of glass here explained sa dak our glass
unlike earthly glass is almost unbreakable yet i do
not like to take a chance on the possibility of a crack
hence the thickness made up of plates set in layers
one over the other to several of your feet

  no wonder i could not throw a stone through it i
laughed

  he grinned you gave us quite a bit of merriment
in your attempts

  we walked over to the compound of the bungalow
dogs were howling from their kennels but none came
to stay our progress to the front door a cool night
breeze was stirring somewhere off in the distance we
heard a lion roar sa dak knocked on the house door

  we heard the shuffle of feet what is it asked
a querulous old voice

  one who comes with a message

  then kindly come in

  the door was opened and i followed the silver man
into a cosy little room a much-lived-in room a lighted
lamp was on the table the professor had been reading
he was a little old man with the high smooth forehead
of the savant but his eyes were burned-out lights

  it is a late hour to be calling sir said sa dak we
saw your light and concluded you were awake

  the old man shrugged his shoulders i can not
sleep i can only wait

  for a message

  the old eyes brightened then saddened again a
message that can never come i was once a scientist
but i committed the crime of sending two men to their
out of the void



death that deed awakes the dormant man within me
and awake now i can never sleep again 

  yet a message would change all that

  no message has come

  i bring such a message professor ezra rollins
you mean    why who are you  i i
i come from those two sir from dana gleason and
richard dorr  

  i have never seen a face and body change as did the
wrinkled weary face and stooping body before us he
was suddenly taller younger in a half a dozen steps
he was across the room at a door through which we
could see a flight of steps elsie elsie he cried they
are safe dyunderstand they landed on mars 

there was movement in the room above our
heads the professor turned to us again for
the first time he seemed to note the strange appearance
of his nocturnal guest did you too come from
mars  he questioned almost fearfully

  the abruian shook his head no professor not
from mars but from 

  he didnt finish his sentence for the old man had
fainted away before the sentence was completed

  the big man was on his knees by the professors
side he picked him up as easily as if he were a child
and laid him tenderly on a divan close at hand then
we were aware of a slender girlish form that had en-
tered the room and rushed to the old man what
have you done what have you done she moaned
you have killed my uncle

  he has only fainted his heart is weak and i
erred in not speaking more carefully water please
his calm voice reassured her and she hurried for a
glass of water but the professor was already recov-
ering tears commenced to flow down his cheeks
the other hastened to speak i am sorry sir i
broached my subject poorly dana gleason and richard
dorr live but the planet they reached was a more dis-
tant one than the planet you call mars they are
both well and happy and asked that i come to you
with their message

  the tears halted i should have realized naturally
   you spoke of a message i   i    can not stand
too much excitement ah    the message    you
have it

  the manuscript was brought forth quickly rollins
was scanning the pages ah danas handwriting
thank god they are safe

  he fumbled for his glasses and putting them on his
nose began to read the girl with the glass of water
still in her hand stood beyond the table she was hold-
ing her dressing gown at her throat i saw then that
she was not so young as i at first imagined obviously
she had already passed her twenties the bloom of her
youth was gone given without thought of self to the
service of the old scientist she was elsie rollins
niece of the professor it is to her i owe the story of
all that had gone before this date when years had
passed she came to me in new york to help me in this
work and so together we compiled this record giving
facts and descriptions as we remembered them

  professor ezra rollins had been a world famous
figure not so many years before when he let it be
known that he was working on a vehicle that could

 carry a man to the moon or better still to our sister
 planet mars he had been ridiculed until in disgust
 he left the college where he had held the scientific re-
 search chair and had come to africa to work un-
 molested by reporters who had interviewed him only
 to laugh at him

   with him had come his several disciples who believed
 fervently in his theory a mechanical engineer and a
 world renowned astronomer had joined him in his
 retreat and for almost twenty years they had worked
 together oyer the plans until at last the gigantic rocket
 that they were to shoot to mars was ready all that
 was needed was the man who would undertake the
 journey it required a man of great daring and cour-
 age a man who would be willing to sacrifice everything
 even his life in the hazardous feat it needed a young
 man a man of learning an extraordinary man

   for two years rollins had roamed through the cities
 looking for his subject as he may be called and at
 last he found him a youth whose lifes training seemed
 to have fitted him for this very deed dana gleason
 jr had finished in the war with great honor but now
 he was at loose ends bereaved of his father with no
 friend and a family of which he knew no member he
 had done everything that man could do on the planet
 earth and he had become undeniably bored with life
 thereon

   gleason did not jump at the chance to go to mars
 at first he thought the scientist was crazy when he
 realized that he was in an extremely sane state of mind
 that all plans had been developed and that the rocket
 was there and ready he agreed to consider the sugges-
 tion  and he considered it as soberly as such a proposi-
 tion could be considered he accepted the professors
 invitation he waited only long enough to make a
 will and straighten up all his earthly affairs thence-
 forth he was in rollins keeping

  the message
you have it


amazing stories

getting ready for the trip

it was seven months before the rocket was to be
shot into space for then mars would be in per-
fect conjunction with earth for the experiment
in that time rollins taught the brave youngster of
twenty-six years all he would have to know on landing
on the red planet once there he was to set to work
to build a gigantic radio a replica of the one which was
stored in the attic of the rollins bungalow and broad-
cast his find to earth then if he discovered intelli-
gent beings on the planet which was a probability he
was with their aid to get himself shot back to earth

  miss rollins described dana gleason as being a
slender young chap about five feet seven inches in
height with dark chestnut hair brown eyes that were
almost black and a fair complexion regular features
that were almost girlish except for a masculinity de-
veloped by the full life of a globe-trotter he was a
quiet person little given to talking with a throaty but
well-trained voice only in anger would he become elo-
quent and then his tones were rich though not very
deep he seemed rather temperamental given to moods
that were affected by the elements-rain made him
dreamy storms excited him bringing color to his
cheeks but the sun left him a quiet and serious person
when he spoke of his proposed journey in the rocket his
eyes sparkled and glowed on horseback he would
roam for hours on the veld and though he enjoyed
the chase he seldom bagged any game he was witty
with a somewhat satirical turn to his humor

  he spent much of his time reading the heavy volumes
that the professor gave him and he had a lively in-
terest in the mechanics of the rocket he made friends
readily with the workers and scientists asking ques-
tions learning facts his thirst for knowledge of all
things was extraordinary he would go on long walks
with one of his new friends or sit relating to them
some of his own experiences though he was never one
to brag and he never spoke of his wealth his bear-
ing with servants was such that he was greatly beloved
by them however he never made any overtures of
friendship to elsie rollins preferring rather the society
of men he showed that he appreciated the fact that
the girl had set him on a pedestal and admired him and
his attitude to her was one of consideration but during
the seven months of his sojourn on the veld she was
never one of his intimates he had great respect for
professor rollins and they became as true friends as
the disparity in age would permit he had one friend
to whom he appeared to be drawn on sight that one
was richard dorr

  richard dorr was practically the only neighbor that
the rollinses had aside from the inhabitants of the few
native villages here and there he was by profession
a mining engineer and somewhere in the hills was his
gold mine but on his word it was a poor sort and he
did not seem to spend much time there with him had
come the rumor of an affaire de coeur that had not
gone well and one could wonder having seen him
how any woman could give him up

  he was tall above the average broad of shoulder
and graceful of limb strong and powerful with the
face of a viking his blue eyes were accustomed to
looking over great distances his hair was the color

of old copper and crinkled and shone in the sun his
skin had teen tanned nearly to the shade of his hair
so that he looked almost as if he had been cast out
of reddish metal he was a great humanitarian and it
was known that he was doing a lot to help the natives
of africa find themselves all the servants within
the rollins compound adored him out in the world
he might have become a great leader of men

  at first he paid little attention to young gleason he
noticed him no more than he noticed the other men
around him he and professor rollins were staunch
friends and could sit for hours discussing the rocket
around which the latters life revolved dorr had given
many valuable suggestions for it and had been at
hand to help during the casting of parts that could
not be obtained in any market he had known and
played with elsie since she came to the veld at the age
of ten when both her father and mother died she
had seen the friendship grow up between gleason
and dorr and noted the many hours they were to-
gether

  many evenings were spent in the little sitting room of
the bungalow with the three men reading and talking
while the girl sat in her corner mending and embroi-
dering secretly she was initialing all of gleasons hand-
kerchiefs and shirts often the four sat down to a
game of bridge one night she surprised an expres-
sion she could not fathom on the face of dorr as she
sat studying the absorbed face of dana gleason sit-
ting there reading one of the professors heavy tomes
it was an expression that she could not interpret and
it puzzled her for many a day

  then dorrs visits became less and less frequent and
days passed before they would hear the beat of his
horses hoofs across the veld his absences were
noted once a time intervened and a boy was sent to
learn if he were sick he returned with the answer
that he was merely busy and when he came there
was an evident surliness

  the time drew near for the departure one evening
rollins faced gleason in just six days my boy you
shall go he told him and rollins eyes shone brightly
there was no change of expression on the youths face
there was only a new glitter in his eyes

  a messenger was dispatched to dorr to apprise him
of the fact he came that night and a quiet evening
was spent not until he was ready to leave did he
speak directly to gleason the professor had gone into
the kitchen for a glass of water miss rollins was
seated in the shadows unnoticed

  so you are going through with this dorr had
suddenly demanded of gleasyn

  the other looked up in surprise then he straight-
ened and got to his feet and what reason have you
to believe that i should not he asked coldly

  i had or rather thought i had a reason dana
gleason but i see now that i was wrong and
without another word he had gone out of the door
rollins returned surprised that he had gone without
a word of farewell

  this is an opportune nsoment to speak of the great
vehicle that was to carry the youth on his way miss
rollins has described it to me and tried to make me
understand the principle by which it worked as i
out of

the void



said before i am a layman and have little knowledge
of machinery

the great invention

he machine was a great cylindrical thing eight
hundred feet long and about fifty feet in diam-
eter its walls were very thick and its nose was
pierced through with great springs it was of smooth
steel and the only things to break its surface were four
great windows many inches in thickness set in its
girdle

  within was a space hermetically sealed in which
were the living-rooms for the traveler these were
slung on springs which were set in slides in such a
manner as to keep the chambers within on an even keel
no matter how the shell might twist and turn from the
living quarters a passage led to the great windows
where small cells were provided for the observer the
living room was no larger than an ordinary chamber
fifteen feet by ten and only seven feet high the
reason for the low ceiling was that once outside of
earths power there would be no gravity and the in-
mate of the room would find himself without weight
perhaps floating about the room by pushing against
the ceiling he could draw and push himself about for
the same reason rails were set around the room at con-
venient heights and the floor walls and ceiling were
heavily padded chairs table and cupboards were all
fastened to the floor and a low padded seat the width
of a bed ran around the entire chamber here the voy-
ager would sleep pillows and coverlets were stored
in the cupboards beneath the seat

  beyond the living room was a small kitchen wherein
was installed an electric stove an iceless refrigerator
a cupboard for dishes and a small sink food in a
concentrated form and water were provided to last
for almost a years time there was also a goodly
supply of fresh foods the rocket carried its own
dynamo with sufficient battery to keep it running for
several months for the purification of the air the
same device that is used in submarines which renews
the air by absorbing the carbon dioxide by soda-lime
and purifying the air chemically was used there
were also tanks of fresh oxygen provided and by open-
ing a valve this could be let into the room oxygen
masks and portable cylinders were also stored to be
used if the traveler found he could not breath the air

   because of his lack of technical knowledge the writer has failed
to explain the fundamental processes by which the rocket when once
out of the atmosphere of earth could hold and increase its speed
as it flew through space

first one must take into consideration newtons third law of
motion ie to every action there is an equal and opposite re-
action that to push anything forward there must be a backward
motion just as a man in walking pushes with one foot backwards as
he propels his body forward in professor rollins rocket this push
is given by means of a kick from an explosive powder this pow-
der is confined in a strong steel chamber capable of resisting the
pressure of the explosion and the gases thereof are ejected through or
driven out of the base of the cartridge through an expanding nozzle a
nozzle that resembles that of a steam turbine and is designed to give the
highest possible velocity to the gas in this manner a great rate of speed
can be obtained each explosion adding acceleration to the speeding body

at the shooting of each cartridge of powder the chamber is
thrown off so that those kept are full ones this gives the rocket
less weight and consequently greater velocity so with each ejection
of the gas the speed ot the rocket has a twofold increase and though
the machine can start at a comparatively slow rate the nearer it is
t its destination the faster it is traveling on sighting its destina-
tion the traveler will then shut off all power so that the rocket will
arrive in the atmosphere of the planet traveling only on the acquired
momentum and an easy landing can be made

   on the rocket weight as it may be termed would be greatly in-
creased by the rapid acceleration at the start but this was all cal-
culated in advance and allowed for the acceleration would also be
under perfect control being maintained by means of a time-clock at
just as great a degree as the passenger could stand

of the alien planet adjoining the living quarters was
the bathroom with all its necessary fixtures the medi-
cine chest was stored with innumerable tubes of tooth
paste powders soaps et cetera together with medicines
for first aid nothing miss rollins said was missing
below was stored a small dismounted airplane to be
put together for use in an emergency

  the machinery that was to keep the rocket moving
was set in the stern once released powder was to be
shot off automatically causing explosions which fur-
nished its source of power

  the hour came for the two preceding days the
house laboratory and compound seethed with activity
and last minute preparations were made everyone
was too excited to think but elsie rollins continued to
wonder why richard dorr had not made his appear-
ance since the night he had spoken to gleason so
strangely

  the rocket had been slung long since on the giant
catapult that would shoot it off and there was much
climbing of the ladder and last inspection only news-
paper reporters were missing then there was supper
when all the mechanics helpers engineers and scien-
tists gathered together for the last time to pay homage
to the valiant youth who was putting his life into the
care of the god of the void toasts were drunk to suc-
cess to the professor to one and all it was a very
quiet meal though the professor was in high spirits
and there was a slight flush on the cheek of dana
gleason

  the meal came to an end and gleason retired to his
sleeping room to gather his last personal effects miss
rollins had seen to it that his linen his socks and his
handkerchiefs were all ready he was also taking
several suits of khaki the last thing he did before
leaving the bungalow was to stuff his pockets full of
chocolate and cigarets though several large cases were
stored in the rocket a number of cases of whiskey
for stimulant and medicinal purposes were also pro-
vided

  it was just about time to start the rocket was to
be shot at exactly twenty-two and a half minutes after
eight oclock how long the trip would take was not
certain professor rollins judged it would take about
seven weeks of course he had experimented with
miniature rockets in a vacuum but how fast the giant
rocket would travel was conjectural

  there were the farewells the last bits of advice were
being given the last round of handshaking was going
on gleason leaned over and kissed elsie rollins
cheek gently and then he was climbing the ladder with
the professor who had one more word to say and so
dana gleason jr disappeared from the sight of men
into the aerial vehicle rollins went in but reappeared
in a few minutes and started his way down the ladder

  then came the unexpected all were too engrossed
with the leave-taking to hear the beat of horses hoofs
and none was aware of richard dorrs arrival until
he had his hands on the ladder in his hurry and ex-
citement he almost threw rollins off his balance al-
ready gleason wa drawing to the great door fitting
in its socket like the breach-block of a cannon when
dorr slipped within

  for another minute the door stood open then slowly
and ponderously it closed-just at the moment that


amazing stories

professor rollins placed his hand on the release lever
it is doubtful whether in the high tension of that mo-
ment he realized that a second passenger was on his
way to mars

  there was a deafening explosion the force of which
sent large pieces of machinery flying through the air
killing two mechanics wounding several others and all
but killing the professor he was knocked unconscious
and did not recover for many minutes so that he was
not an eyewitness to that awful departure

professor rollins now looked up from
his study of the manuscript the silver man had
brought him his face was screwed up into a
grimace such as a child would make his mouth trem-
bling but    but this contains nothing but facts
about this unknown planet he muttered

  yes said sa dak dana gleason has made a
worthy survey of the planet i find it complete

  that is all right for the universities but that isnt
what i want man i want danas own story what
happened  what happened 

  the other smiled gently that is all there is sir
tears came to the eyes of the old man and i want
more i want facts i must know just what occurred
everything that took place the story the story   he
looked up helplessly you say they are well and
happy how did they find this happiness and con-
tentment 

   it is a long story sir

  you know it then  you will tell me  you were an
eyewitness 

  yes i was an eyewitness and since you insist
sir i shall do my best in my desk i have the diary of
dana gleason that may interest you will you accom-
pany me to my machine sir or shall i bring it here
we will go with you only lets hurry cried the
old man in his excitement

  and you miss rollins inquired sa dak

  she nodded then remembering that she was not
dressed for outdoors asked that we wait a moment she
returned very soon with a light coat on we went to
the yodvcrl whose glass surface was aglow with its
inner lights

  my host and the professor walked ahead miss
rollins and i followed sa dak was trying to direct
the eye of the scientist to the construction of the great
vehicle modeled after the professors invention but the
old man paid no attention he was intent on hearing the
story i told miss rollins something of my abduction
and she told me a little more of what had preceded that
astounding departure soon we entered the vehicle

  tor was there to greet us sa dak explained why
we were there and then he turned to us now he
said if you will accompany me through the vehicle
i can demonstrate to you some of the devices which
dana gleason and richard dorr found in use on
abrui that will make the telling of the story easier
for me

the house of a neighbor

i was beginning to feel a little weak on account of
my shoulder but forcing it from my mind i fol-
lowed the little party we went into the room
in which i first found myself this said our host

is called the atol or main living room of the abruian
home here is where the family gather to eat their
meals and discuss the days events here they greet
their friends here they start the day with their morning
swim the lowliest home possesses its swimming pool
its potted flowers its scenic walls the scene you see
depicted here is typical of abruin scenery

  in arranging the rooms in my rocket i have tried
to reproduce exactly my home in abrui he continued
as he led us to the next room which proved to be a
small reproduction of the first room with a smaller
pool and fewer flowers there were four small door-
ways two in either wall leading to bedrooms the
scene on the walls was that of a garden a group of
two or three women were seated on low stone benches
under the shade of some low trees and a short distance
away two men were practicing some knife play each
holding a short dagger in either hand with which he
attempted to break through the others guard on an-
other wall several children were seated in a circle with
the markers of some strange game in their hands a
golden slave-girl stood near by with a silver baby in her
arms a game of tag played by youths of about fif-
teen or sixteen was in progress among some shrub-
beries another slave was working in a flower bed it
was a happy life-like scene and the reproductions of the
people of abrui were very fine i noticed that the
costume worn by the women was exactly like that worn
by tor while the children wore suits of the same style
somewhat abbreviated one of the women wore a
long flowing cape that fastened to the shoulder and
reached to the ground the colors used were of every
shade and hue and some were unknown to us the
light that shone over everything was rosy and seemed
to come from the overlarge pinkish globe that i had
seen painted in the atol and had objected to it was
in truth the second sun of abrui

  this room said sa dak is called the cof and is
the inner room of the house here is one of the bed-
rooms and he brushed aside the curtains of one of
the small doorways revealing a small cell-like chamber
furnished simply with a wide couch a chair a chest of
drawers and a long mirror in these rooms the family
sleep but this chamber is sacred to the women of the
house here they come when not disposed to mingle
with their friends and only the family are allowed
entrance here the mistress of the house carries on
her affairs and directs the welfare of her house

  the next room we were informed was the kitchen
though at first glance it was no more than a small
chamber with the walls of opaque glass however by
touching a small lever cljse to the doorway it was
transformed the glass covering opened out reveal-
ing shelf after shelf containing various dishes on
one side was a glass-enclosed refrigerator and we could
see the array of food placed within all around the
room projected a piece of smooth glass about two feet
into the room this could be utilized for the table i
saw neither stove nor any other means for cooking

  we were enlightened however removing a small
dish made of glass from one of the shelves our host
took from the refrigerator which i call by that name
although there was no visible means for the preserva-
tion of food a strange vegetable about the size of a
grapefruit this he dropped into the glass dish he held
out of the void



in his hand immediately before our eyes a change
took place the food began to cook we saw it soften
its juices run and a delicious odor filled the room in
less than five minutes the vegetable was entirely cooked
taking three small metal plates from another cupboard
our host then served the vegetable on the plates cut-
ting it with a knife of glass tor went for three
spoon-like articles that had tiny prongs on their tips
somewhat like our ice-cream forks at home the
vegetable was quite good

taking another glass dish the man poured into it
some milk from a metal container and dropping into
it several small pellets he stirred it well while we
watched the process that was taking place the milk
had begun to freeze when we ate it we found it was
somewhat like ice cream flavored with something that
tasted like sweetened cinnamon

  we all marveled over these utensils and our host
went on to explain that the cooking dishes were
treated with a solution derived from radium which
caused the food placed within to cook immediately it
was the same for the freezing dishes only the
inside of the dishes were treated so that it was pos-
sible to hold them in ones hand while the change was
taking place the inside of the refrigerator had
been treated in a similar way but to a less degree than
the dishes so that foods could be kept indefinitely and
still be edible haw my wife who is quite a cook
would have envied such cooking methods

  i shall now show you our stable  went on sa
dak and led us to a small chamber like the others
it was scrupulously clean a low manger was arranged
in one wall and there were four of the prettiest little
creatures i have ever seen they were somewhat
smaller than our cows standing no more than three
feet high and looked somewhat like deer with soft
liquid eyes and faces that were dog-like one was a
bull while two had the large developed udders of a
cow the fourth creature was no more than a calf

  these are called muti the little one there was
born since leaving abrui

  the little creatures had looked up at our entrance
and in their eyes was an expression of intelligence
that is never seen in the eyes of earthly cattle their
master made some soft sounds in his throat and there
was response from the bull who made a like sound for
a minute or two they continued and it almost seemed
as if they were actually talking yes went on the
man we have discovered the language of our beasts
and make it a practice to converse with them

  we showed our astonishment

  and why not he continued why should ani-
mals be denied the right of speech naturally their
intelligence is not equal to the thinking mind of man
but it is far better that they understand what is ex-
pected of them

  how can you kill them then  it seems horrible to
me to think of eating their flesh observed elsie
rollins

  the man smiled we do not eat their flesh miss
rollins that is civilized man does not we know
that fruits and vegetables are quite as strength-giving
as meat no our muti are raised only for the milk
they give and when that supply is gone the animal

is simply done away with in a manner that gives no
pain they know this and understand that we treat
them no differently than we treat ourselves

  you mean that when age comes you kill the
old

  is not that the better way the aged are only a
burden to themselves as well as to others their value
to the state is nil only we do not kill we go to
sleep we have discovered a ray that destroys animal
life dissolving the compounds that make up our bodies
this ray turned upon us does away with the body com-
pletely the chemical compounds returning to their
former state there is no pain no suffering only a
last sweet sleep

  and the soul

  goes to its appointed place of that we do not
pretend to know anything

  i could not but think how pleasant such an end would
be no suffering no funeral no grave no tomb-
stone

  i would like to die that way sighed the professor

  i saw that elsie rollins was trying to break the
spell that these thoughts had wrapped about us our
host was quick to see this and he now suggested that
we return to the atol where we could comfortably dis-
cuss life on abrui

  you will notice he said that the ceilings of the
rooms we have passed through are all of glass it is
so on abrui every house is but one floor in height
the light from the two suns of the planet shines upon
these roofs giving daylight to the rooms again we
use radium which being a phosphorescent element
takes into itself the sunlight thus distributed responds
to it and at night redispenses it so that at all times we
have an even glow of light we find that people living
under this light are greatly benefited disease is there-
fore completely done away with it took many years
to discover this use of radium for radium in its raw
state as you must know does bodily harm to anyone
exposed to it we also have the means of shutting
this light off at will

  we had now returned to the living room the
golden slave appeared and was arranging several
couches into a small circle and we were invited to take
our places there tor the youth had thrown himself
on the floor on a pile of cushions while our host drew
up a chair that was standing near my shoulder pained
again and i appreciated the relief of repose

  at a word from his master the slave left the room
and shortly returned carrying a small black leather-
bound book miss rollins exclaimed the diary of
dana gleason it was handed to her

  perhaps you will read a few of its entries for us
they may prove of interest said sa dak she was
already skimming the pages

  why here she said is the date on which uncle
ezra first approached dana with the proposition of his
taking the trip to mars

  read it said the professor since entering the
yodvcrl rollins seemed a different man he had got-
ten a new interest he seemed younger and brighter
he was happy perhaps for the first time since that
fateful night

  the young woman acquiesced and commenced to
read in a clear voice

in the great fall of the rochet both of them marveled at the
majesty of the breaking up she fell to the ground like a bit of
fluff scarcely sustaining a jar

the diary

  i  o-day fate came to me in the guise of science
at first when professor ezra rollins spoke of
a trip to mars i thought him crazed yet as he
talked his face alight with the fire of his passion i
realized how earnest and intense he was he left me
with my mind in a whirl shall i take this one chance
in a million can i do it would dad have done it
had the professor only known me for what i am he
would never have come to me but havent i proved
myself equal to any man why cant i do this

  i am sure dad would have done it and he would
have expected me to do it to remain here on earth
can mean but one thing for me-exposure howard
courtland will keep his promise even though i put the
world between us and i born of woman though i am
can not and will not give up the heritage my father
has given me no man shall force me to admit that i
am a woman-thing even though i was born with the
body of one 

  miss rollins looked up in wonder her face had
gone white as she read and a low groan from the pro-
fessor showed that he understood dana gleason a

woman the three of us exclaimed in one breath and
turned to our host

  he smiled somewhat sadly and there was sorrow in
his eyes true i had forgotten that you believed dana
gleason a man i am not certain but i believe her
father hated women and was resolved to raise his
daughter as a son this courtland of whom she speaks
had discovered the truth and would have disclosed her
secret thinking he could make her his wife dana
gleason is an attractive woman

  a woman mused miss rollins then and her
eyes brightened that explains many things i could
never understand did    did dick   richard dorr
accompany her    knowing 

  yes he knew

  read elsie read what happened aboard the
rocket said the professor impatiently

  i do not feel quite right about reading this she
said

  the silver man shrugged his shoulders dana wrote
the story of her own experiences and i fear i could
not do the tale justice i am certain she would have no
objection to your reading it
out of the void



  none of us thought to ask how he had obtained the
little book

  throwing aside her qualms miss rollins hastily
turned the page

  aboard the rocket it read

  mars is due ahead and earth is behind us for
the first time man has stepped into the great unex-
plored vacuity-space it takes time for one to collect
ones thoughts out here already forty-eight hours
have passed and i can only now bring myself to write
writing in this diary has become such a fixed habit with
me that to neglect it is like neglecting a dear friend

  when i climbed the ladder for the last time i hardly
expected what next took place although i had looked
for richard dorr among the friends that bade me good-
bye six days before he had addressed me in an odd
manner believing that i who had given my word would
back out before the moment of departure i could not
imagine what had made him think such a thing know-
ing me as he did

  the day had passed and at last i was ready to
leave forgetting dorr entirely in my concern for the
rocket after a few more words and a warm hand
clasp the professor backed out and i was ready to
swing the great door that would seal me within when
suddenly richard dorr appeared at the aperture in
surprise i cried out for him to go back for only a few
minutes would elapse before i should be hurled on my
way instead of obeying he came toward me for
gods sake i cried go the minutes are precious he
still came on with a smile on his face then he had
his hand on the door and made ready to push it to
what are you doing i demanded

   i am going with you he said quietly

  i must have lost my head then for i was command-
ing him to leave even while i was fastening the bolts
and pulling and adjusting the levers into place

   what  would you have me killed by the moving
machinery he questioned and there was a twinkle in
his eyes

  i could say nothing and then all conversation was
cut short rollins had pulled the lever without taking
into consideration the fact that his friend was within
the shock of the explosion was terrific and we were
both thrown off our feet i had been thrown to the
floor in a corner and a great pressure seemed pushing
down upon me so that i felt i should be crushed it
was almost impossible to take a breath so tightly were
my lungs compressed and my ribs seemed strained to
a breaking point-then a darkness swept over me it
was several minutes before i came to feeling bruised
and sore in all my body painfully i tried to sit up i
had known that something of this sort would happen
caused by the great shock of shooting the rocket but
i had not been prepared for anything as bad as this

t ooking about i saw dorr quite close to me he

  i was coming out of his stupor i managed to sit up
and he did likewise later he admitted that he had be-
lieved all the oxygen in the chamber had been forced
out leaving us without air to breathe everything was
working smoothly however

  as we left earth we had both slipped to the rear of
the chamber as earths gravity tried to retain its hold

upon us that too passed and we knew that strange
sense of having practically no weight we both started
to our feet and were unprepared for what followed
we were suddenly plunging toward the ceiling as
easily as feathers by putting out a hand against the
ceiling we pushed ourselves downward to the floor and
so gained our feet grasping one of the hand-rails
we managed to keep there then by planting our feet
firmly and using a swaying motion we were able to
walk upright i could foresee funny experiences to
come

   well i observed quite superfluously we are on
our way out of earths orbit

  dorr shrugged his broad shoulders and going into
the bathroom returned with a bottle of iodine and
quietly painted a slight scratch on his hand

   how did you fare  he questioned holding out the
bottle

  impatiently i brushed it aside now tell me why
have you come  i demanded

   and if my reason does not suit will you open
the door and ask me to step out  he queried with a
grin

  i could not help but laugh at such an idea but i
waited for my answer

  oh i merely figured that two headsll be better
than one dana gleason he answered

   and the true reason  surely had professor rol-
lins known of your aspiration he would not have had
to seek me out kindly explain 

  he lifted his eyes to mine they were hard look-
ing eyes less than six days ago i had no thought of
this i was heartily contented with my corner of the
world i did not then nor do i now approve of you
or anyone else making this hazardous trip one can die
much more easily at home however that is neither
here nor there professor rollins is a friend of mine
one of the finest of men with one of the finest brains
in this world i admire his courage just as i admire
your courage and it is in the interest of rollins that
i decided at the last moment to accompany you

  i was still not satisfied for i knew that dorr was
not speaking the truth and i could not be content until
i was sure of his real purpose had professor rol-
lins felt that it would take two men to make this trip
we would have recruited another i stated

  he answered in a resigned tone i have told you
why but since you require more  let us suppose
that you do reach mars you are certain to find
strange conditions there perhaps wild beasts wild
men or  a dead world of nothing true you have
considered all that prepared for it but you have for-
gotten one thing in your enthusiasm dana gleason   
are you able to cope with these adversities  are you
   are you    

   man enough  i put in

   thats just it    are you man enough dana
gleason 

  it dawned upon me what dorr was driving at some-
how he like howard courtland had learned the truth
he knew me to be a woman he nodded as he saw
that realization in my eyes just that oh yes i know
your records  i know all your courageous deeds
your researches your science your war experiences
your bravery yes i know all that but with it all   


amazing stories

you are a woman you are brave strong great willed
yet you arc at a disadvantage and you are attempting
a tremendous thing how stupendous neither of us can
guess so i came you see with no ulterior motive i
simply came in the interest of my friend professor
rollins  

  i couldnt speak for several moments and when i
did it was in a trembling voice and knowing this   
you didnt go to the professor and tell him the truth
he would not have let me go then 

  and break his heart no i saw that you were
really going through with his plans and were the per-
son for it henceforth you may look upon me as
your bodyguard

   how heroic i said with a curl of my lip

   no rather like a fool i should say i liked his
easy manner

  then you count us both fools

  a smile came to his bronzed face impulsively i
held out my hand and we gave a hearty hand-clasp
together we would see our foolishness through

  the room was quiet but for the hum of the electric
motors and our voices we are in a perfectly sealed
chamber where no sound can penetrate we hear
nothing of the timed explosions that are now taking
place according to schedule shooting us onward across
space i examined the various meters that showed our
rate of velocity and our mileage the oxygen gauge
the water gauge and the electrical instruments showed
everything to be working in proper order

viewing the void

 t was now prepared to visit the lookouts and
invited dorr to accompany me we crept down
a the short passage and faced the windows at
first we could see nothing we were in an inky black-
ness for since there is nothing to reflect the rays of the
sun they travel onward to more distant bodies then
far off we began to distinguish the things we call stars
their brilliancy was almost blinding for here there
is nothing to affect their rays overhead the milky
way glistened and we saw the light of more stars than
we had ever seen upon earth directly behind us lay
the sun a great flaming ball that was blinding a
little to the left appearing as large though not as
bright as old sol was mother earth near her
hovered the good old moon now only a darker blot
against the dark side of the planet in several direc-
tions above and below we could see the brilliant stars
they did not twinkle but looked clearly back at us

  after about an hour of this we returned to our
quarters and i proceeded to take dorr on a tour of in-
spection of our quarters then finding we were hungry
we sought food there were enough fresh foods to last
perhaps three weeks-if the refrigeration held out and
there was a quantity of perishable foods that would
hold without refrigeration for awhile we dined on a
young fried broiler that i knew thoughtful little elsie
rollins had prepared for me i found a number of
jars of jam just as thoughtfully placed there for me
what wonder would be reflected in her brown eyes if
she knew that the hero she has been worshiping all
these months was of her own sex had i been of dif-

ferent stuff i would have confided in her all my hopes
and desires my joys and disappointments but i am not
womanish or mannish enough either to indulge in such
a pastime never having had a confidant i should
not know how to confide only this little book knows
me for what i am how the devotees of the daily
papers would revel if they could read this volume how
anxiously they used to seek copy from dad and me
i only trust that mars knows nothing of yellow
journalism

  so ended that entry the next was made three
days later

  seventy-two hours have passed i cant count by
days for day and night are all one to us even in
our lookout there is no change in that darkness about
us we eat sleep and awake by the clock several
meteorites passed a few hours ago-great masses fall-
ing ever falling do they ever reach bottom  in the
look-out i feel as if i were trespassing upon the domain
of the one who controls this great illimitable sameness

  dick and i share alike in all the chores aboard our
ship we have arranged to take turns at arranging
meals each vying to make his or her meal the most
appetizing and at the same time conserving the fresh
foods of dish-washing we make a great ado jealously
attempting to prove our individual superiority in the
feat we are both reading the heavy books with
which professor rollins so thoroughly stocked the cup-
boards-books that teach us even more about what we
are to expect on mars when the hour grows late and
we are weary the pillows and coverlets are brought
from their places we lie down after first removing our
boots and loosing our belts and collars we sleep thus
fully clothed for as dick says one can never tell
what pranks the void might play upon us and we want
at least to be dressed and ready then smoking our
last cigarets we toss a coin to see who is to turn out
the light we leave only a small light burning in a
shaded reading lamp for an emergency

  how thankful i am that richard dorr elected to
join me how drear the hours would have been alone
and it is surprising how much fun can be had in our
tight quarters how surprised our friends with whom
we have gained reputations for being staid and serious
would be yet it is through the means of play that we
forget the vastness outside and the meagerness of our
chance to live

  our instruments show that we are now traveling at
the rate of fifty thousand miles per hour we are al-
ready seven million and two hundred thousand miles
from earth in another twenty-four hours we shall
be traveling several thousand miles faster for as each
magazine of powder is shot and its gas ejected we
gain velocity sitting down with a paper and pencil
i calculated that we should average sixty thousand miles
per hour throughout the entire trip of thirty-four mil-
lion miles which is the present distance of mars from
earth it will therefore take us exactly twenty-three
days thirteen hours and a fraction to reach the red
planet professor rollins had computed that it would
take us at least thirty-five days but of course he was
not able to judge just how swiftly the rocket could
travel

  the next entry was made ten days later
out of the void



  in approximately nine days more we shall land
upon mars if we do land never have we al-
lowed ourselves to forget that word if these days
have been pleasant in the company of richard dorr
he has proven himself a perfect companion he is a
well-versed man with a fine working knowledge of peo-
ple his love for his work helping the natives of
africa was sincere what a pity that it is all over and
that such a man is lost to earth i who have led
such a worthless indolent life seeking only my own
pleasure pitting my own strength and mind against that
of man proving to myself that nothing is impossible to
me am a poor sort of a person beside this man who has
always given himself in behalf of his fellow-men i
see now that i have shirked my duty as a woman in
the guise of a hater of that sex and what crude stuff
i am made of compared to this man who gave up his
life work in the interest of a friend

  one has much time out here in the void to think of
the past god are we to live  shall we ever see
grass and trees again shall we ever see sun on the
water  shall we ever know the glory of a storm again 
shall i be allowed to begin a new life i can only feel
the appalling minuteness of man who tries to place
himself on the level of a god who can create this big-
ness how scornful he must be of us have i been
right in hating my mother as my father taught me to
do  is it not possible that he was at fault also  are
they somewhere watching

  now we see due ahead the red eye of mars in
size he has become as large as the sun appears to us
from earth and glows with a copperish light that is
strange and awesome out here in the blackness hourly
earth has dwindled a dark brownish globe we see
only its dark side with its one moon beyond lies
the sun red and fiery with never a setting far be-
low and above all about us are the lights of distant
constellations some appearing blue to us others green
and so for all the colors of the spectrum one star
glows with a beautiful violet light how strange it
must be to have a green sun lighting ones world we
passed a number of meteorites today and we feared
that one particularly large one would surely hit us we
passed by ere it reached our path

  what god what mind could have conceived this
terrible greatness is he laughing at us here in our
tiny atom traversing this god-place does he pity us
in our fall does he look with wonder and amaze-
ment at his creatures who so boldly dare  or did he
plan this eons ago and is he merely watching intently
now as we go our fated way

  dick and i were discussing this but he knows no
answer his belief in a god a true god who sees the
sparrow fall can not be shaken and i who have been
taught to laugh at mens belief in god-things am
shaken can one look on these vastnesses these great
worlds and doubt

  we are now traveling much faster than i ever be-
lieved possible at every well-timed explosion we gain
velocity and with each discharge of the magazine and

the lightening of ton after ton the rocket shoots ahead
-like a hound from hell dick said that at this rate
we shall reach mars earlier than my schedule even as
i write the red planet comes closer it lies above us
or so it seems but i am sure we head directly for it
twenty-four hours later

arth is behind while before us mars looms
hugely its strange spots and markings are
very clearly defined the lines that are believed to be
canals pass black and wide across its face we wait
breathlessly as we draw near leaving the look-out
chambers only long enough to eat today we ate the
last piece of meat rashers of bacon

  sixty-hours later

od has answered we are passing mars
for many breathless hours we were uncer-
tain but now mars lies not in our path but away
thousands of miles to our left i can not think i can
not talk only by putting down these little black words
can i remain calm dick has nothing to say he sits
with me here before the window smoking his pipe this
is the end we have shot our bow and we failed could
there still be a possibility that mars will reach out and
draw us into his orbit therein lies our hope still
he is senile his strength has left him

  for hours we watched mars draw closer until we
thought we saw grass and trees we put everything
in readiness one pull of the lever and the gauge that
controls the powder charges would have closed proudly
we would have swung in line with the great planet we
inspected everything saw that nothing was forgotten
from rifles to pick-axes i gathered together all my
data the blue prints for the giant radio set and for the
loading of our rocket we stuffed our pockets with
chocolate and cigarets but mars disdains us there
is no welcoming pull of gravity the instruments show
no change is there still a chance that we might land
on mars perhaps a slim bare chance

  two days later

  it is true we have completely passed mars he lies
there slowly swinging in space how long we can
travel we do not know perhaps a year or even two it
will be all the same ever falling falling we will be
caught like rats in a trap there was but one chance in
a thousand a million and that chance failed us yet
there remains one last hope another planet may accept
us but what will be our fate 

  jupiter he is yet too young saturn is older
but could he sustain us neptune he is so poorly
warmed by the sun and there is distant uranus
beyond that what 

  still why should i complain did i in losing a
world not gain something else something more pre-
cious  who could have said that dana gleason should
be happy in discovering her womanhood  oh the irony
of it on earth i was not ready to recognize the
chance now

amazing stories

that any move on his part in that direction would be
met by rebuffs a hint dropped to mr henley one
day had elicited nothing but a hurried and ill-concealed
anxiety to change the subject

  austin gave up definitely the idea of questioning his
mother partly because he felt very sure that she was
at the bottom of the conspiracy and partly because he
loved her dearly and shrank from the thought of caus-
ing her pain she was a fragile dark-eyed person with
white hair a quick eager manner and tiny soft hands
that were always reaching for him with caresses he
admired her as greatly as he loved her

  an inkling of the truth came to him in quite an
unexpected manner during his mothers absence in
new york one rainy day and while mr henley was
writing some letters in his room austin stole down to
the sloop unobserved by the rest of the household cast
the boat loose hoisted the sail and stood out into the
open sound in a brisk north-wester with his eyes on
the distant connecticut shore line he was a good
sailor and he had learned to handle the little craft
with the skill of a veteran so the increasing of wind
did not disturb him he merely took a reef in the
mainsail and went on he had no definite idea of
where he was going he merely felt the immediate
need of the open of wind and rain sweeping down
upon him from illimitable spaces

  it was not long before he noticed that more clouds
were gathering in the north he wondered if a storm
was coming up and in the same breath hoped that
one was he felt elated at the thought curiously light
and free from restraint tiller in hand he watched
the green seas come tumbling along the rail as the
sloop heeled to the pressure of her sails she clove the
crested seas shaking the spume and smother from
her bows at each leap spindrift lashed his face he
shouted with exultation

  so engrossed was he with his newly-acquired free-
dom that he did not notice the rapid foreshortening of
all horizons the shifting of the wind and the blotting
out of the land forward and aft an hour later after
tacking about double-reefed in the teeth of the gale he
was forced to give her sheet and run off free another
hour and he knew that he was being blown out to sea
at the rate of ten miles an hour

  he was not frightened his elation at his new-found
liberty left no room for fear for the first time in
his life he was going about the business of living inde-
pendently he felt like one who had claimed at last
some long deferred birthright

  after six days of knocking about the atlantic with
a box of sea-biscuits and a small breaker of water as
the only food and drink he was picked up by a
gloucester-man returning homeward full to the deck
with halibut he slept in one of its bunks nearly all
the way back to gloucester while the sloop was towed
astern he was completely exhausted the exhilara-
tion was gone his body seemed in the grip of some
monstrous apathy from which he was unable to rouse
himself even after being drenched with sleep he
felt a curious disinclination to stir

  the authorities at gloucester communicated with his
mother at once she arrived in her car accompanied
by doctor goldwin and henley that same afternoon
with terror in her dark eyes which austin searched

his tired mind in vain to account for he had expected
a scolding but none came doctor goldwin gave him
one of the orange-colored capsules and the four re-
turned a silent party

  austin had never seen his mother so tender before
she cried nearly all the way down the coast she
took his face between her small soft hands and searched
his eyes with a sort of breathless intentness that puzzled
him he tried to respond to her caresses but they left
him cold and apathetic he was conscious even of a
slight feeling of nausea at her demonstrativeness he
glanced at mr henley for an explanation of this ex-
traordinary phenomenon but the tutor averted his face
as if loath to meet his questioning eyes drowsiness
overtook him at last he sank back in the cushioned
seat and slept

when he opened his eyes the next morning he
found that he was in bed in his own room he
lay for a long time trying to review the happenings of
the last ten days but his brain refused to respond to
any orderly survey he felt no desire for anything
except to lie prone but he did not get any feeling of
rest or relaxation from the thought of remaining in
bed he glanced about the chamber he had a mo-
mentary illusion of being in a strange room even the
most familiar object seemed remote and unreal

  he was conscious of being thirsty but it took him
several minutes to make up his mind to arise and search
for a glass in the bathroom as he passed the cheval
mirror on his way back to bed he caught sight of him-
self therein and paused blinking at the image he saw
there a sallow face with lacklustre eyeballs set deeply
in narrowed slits he ran his fingers through his hair
as if by this motion to brush away the vision that con-
fronted him in the mirror and noted that his hair felt
curiously dry and brittle to the touch

  he stood staring at himself for some moments then
crept back to bed he didnt understand what had
happened and his mind was too tired to grapple with
the problem when the nurse brought him his capsule
fifteen minutes later he swallowed it and said nothing

  during his convalescence he tried to screw up cour-
age to get out of bed and look at himself in the mirror
and when he finally did get the courage to do so at
the end of the second week he saw there a well set-up
youth with clear blue eyes soft wavy hair and a healthy
ruddy skin he decided that he had dreamed that
other image

  when he was twenty-two years old his mother died
the day before she had been well and happy they
had motored to montauk point and had lunched at
a wayside inn upon returning she had complained of
a slight headache and had retired early the following
morning elaine the maid had gone into her room to
awaken her and had found her lying dead upon the
canopied bed with her white head thrown back and
her small hands clutching the silken covers she had
scarcely stirred death had been instantaneous and
except for the tightly-closed hands there was no evi-
dence of pain or struggle her heart had simply
stopped

  ausfin was left in a daze by the unexpectedness of
it and the confusion of the household robbed of its
governing hand added to his misery he stayed beside
the grim inheritance



her until doctor goldwin arrived and ordered him to
leave the room even then he could hardly tear him-
self away he gave the still form on the bed one last
look and stumbled downstairs after old sims then
outdoors and down to the sloop

  he sailed on the sound that afternoon his mind a
blank when he returned he found that they had
taken her away her room had been made up he
wandered about its crypt-like emptiness and touched
her things one by one on the dressing table there
was a small silver casket containing a few long strands
of white hair she had told him laughingly one day
that she was saving them toward a switch for old
age he touched the strands lightly with the tips of
his fingers now they seemed still a part of her living
fragile self

  he opened the door of the clothes closet doll-like
dresses hung there in orderly rows and a dozen pairs
of tiny cinderella slippers stood against the wall her
warm eager personality seemed to be expressed in
every pair to be lingering in every last fold of each
dainty garment he wanted to gather them up in his
arms and take them to some secluded spot and cry
over them but he couldnt cry   

  a week after the funeral there was a meeting in
the library between several men with the exception
of dr goldwin all were strangers to austin the
will was read by a heavy-faced man with a porcine
brow and a flattened skull about which a fringe of
coarse iron gray hair rode like a misplaced halo

  austin listened abstractedly he gathered from the
stilted legal phraseology that he was the only heir
later that the heavy-faced man whose name was stod-
dard and who seemed to be a distant relative of his
dead father had succeeded in getting himself appointed
by the court as administrator in the discussion that
followed the reading of the will austin discovered that
his mother had lived far beyond her income for years
and that the estate was heavily incumbered the man
stoddard informed all present in somewhat pompous
tone that he would do his best to save what was left
of the crane fortune

  austin looked at the speaker and said nothing fi-
nance was a closed book to him and an instinctive dis-
trust of the man kept him silent after much arguing
pro and con it was decided that the servants were to
be discharged the heavily mortgaged house offered
for sale and that austin was to live with the stoddards
in new york until other arrangements could be made

the men gathered up their legal documents and
brief cases and left doctor goldwin alone re-
mained when the sound of their motor had died
away in the distance the physician stopped pacing the
floor and said

im going to tell you something my boy-something
that ought to have been told you long before this
austin felt a shock pass through his body as his eyes
met the serious kindly ones of the old physician bent
upon him searchingly

  yes he replied breathlessly

  you have wondered often about certain things-i
refer particularly to the medicine

  austin nodded he gripped the arms of his chair
he was on the brink of a momentous discovery the

realization of it made him inarticulate

  i am going to tell you what i consider necessary
for you to know the physician went on against my
advice your mother kept it from you i tried to make
her see her error and to make her realize the danger
she exposed you to by keeping you in ignorance of cer-
tain things but she wouldnt listen women are that
way sentimental and unwilling to face the truths of
life he paused and glanced at the white face staring
up at him from the depths of the cushioned chair
theres nothing to be frightened at lad he said
pull yourself together and listen to me

  i am listening austin replied with an effort to
keep his voice steady

  do you know what a cretin is the physician
asked

  austin shook his head

  i am not going to go into obscure medical termi-
nology that would only confuse you a cretin is a man
or a woman in whom from some pathological defect
the cause or origin of which is as yet unknown a cer-
tain gland functions improperly or not at all by
administering extracts of such a gland taken from
animals the missing ingredients can be supplied arti-
ficially and with the identical results attained in natures
most wonderful laboratory the human body

  you were born a cretin this need not frighten
you there are thousands of them we rub shoul-
ders with them every day but no one except the most
intimate members of their families know it they
are being constantly watched and supplied with the
missing ingredients which keeps them normal and
healthy it is only when deprived of these through
ignorance or by not being themselves informed about
their affliction that the tragedy of retrogression occurs
what dyou mean austin asked breathlessly

  i mean that they will return to the cretinous state
if the supply of glandular extract is cut off or with-
held the retrogression begins almost at once even
in a few days there is a marked change the pulse
becomes slow the mind sluggish the body begins
to shrink the features change the skin becomes dry
and sallow and the hair brittle if you could have seen
yourself four years ago when we brought you back
from your attempt at crossing the atlantic in the sloop
after being deprived of your medicine for ten days
youd know what i mean

  i did see myself in the mirror of my room austin
replied in a small tense voice

  the physician started

  and youve been carrying that picture in your mind
unexplained ever since you poor lad

  i-i thought that i dreamed it-afterwards

i see i understand the recovery when the ex-
tract is again supplied is as rapid as the retrogression
austin was silent the answers to a thousand ques-
tions crowded into his mind at once but one question
was still burning there unanswered

  what would happen to me if this medicine was cut
off entirely and forever heasked

  the physician held up his hand in protest

  the picture would be too unpleasant for me to paint
and for you to contemplate remember what you saw
in the mirror four years ago and imagine that magni-
fied a hundred fold but there is no reason to fear

its supply being cut off it is easily accessible and not
particularly expensive i merely tell you all this for
your own protection and to warn you not to be with-
out it anywhere for more than twenty-four hours

austin cranes readjustment

his life with the stoddards in new york wa
a series of adjustments and compromises for
austin hitherto the world had revolved about
him now he found himself suddenly in the role of
satellite from the position of prince royal with every
whim or wish anticipated and gratified he had de-
scended at once to the level of commoner at home
someone had always stood between himself and the
realities of life in the stoddard mansion on upper
fifth avenue no one seemed to care what he did nor
when or how he did it the most ordinary things
which every man does for himself as a matter of course
in the daily prosecution of existence presented them-
selves as problems to austin

  at first he was confused and unhappy but gradually
his untrained mind began to adjust itself to the new
manner of things little by little his dormant faculties
began to react to the new influences and responsibili-
ties each experience was a draft upon his resources
that must be honored at once it became a game a
fascinating sport with his soul and integrity as the
stakes

  he was quick to learn he did not know that within
the human brain lies the knowledge of all things and
that only by contact with problems this knowledge
comes forth he merely knew that he must learn or
perish he was confronted with problems which boys
of ten had assimilated before their milk teeth were
gone his twenty-two year old mind bridged the chasm
in an instant there was nothing to unlearn his
brain sensitized to receive whatever might come its
way was like a virgin phonograph record awaiting the
recording needle

  the stoddard household puzzled him his dislike
of the man stoddard was deep-rooted and it increased
as time went on he had never encountered a human
of predatory habits before there was no precedent
to guide him his distrust was instinctive

  there was a mrs stoddard a florid coarse woman
as heavy as her husband with prominent china-blue
eyes and a great pile of over-bright yellow hair which
in spite of its elaborate dressing always seemed in
imminent danger of tumbling about her ears austin
encountered her rarely except at mealtimes she ig-
nored him utterly for both circumstances he was
thankful when she ate her tiered chin reminded him
of the pouch of a pelican she seemed to divide her
time equally between her suite of rooms in the east
wing of the big house and her showy automobile

  the stoddards were childless but there was another
member of the household whose exact status austin
was unable to determine her name was ann barrett
and she seemed to occupy the position of a servant
wlio was displayed as a poor relation only at mealtimes
or when company was present for the sake of appear-
ances she also was a distant relative of mr stoddard
and had become indigent it seemed shortly after join-
ing the household she was a quiet self-effacing crea-
ture who rarely spoke except when addressed and

whose brown eyes austin caught now and then regard-
ing him with a sort of repressed warning across the
table or when he encountered her in the dim cavernous
hallways he had the curious feeling that she was
forever on the point of telling him something but
that she was not sure whether she ought to

  altogether it was a strange household a person
of experience would have been warned but in austins
limited contact with life he had not yet encountered
knavery he felt merely a sense of restlessness and
depression that was accentuated by the tomb-like air
of the big house even the servants were aloof and
impersonal not like old tender-hearted sims and
friendly garrulous culp the only person he felt
anything in common with was the girl ann he was
unable to account for this feeling but there were times
when he wanted to take her aside and tell her about his
mother at such times he wondered if her hands were
soft and cool like his mothers

  once a month he called at doctor goldwins offices
for a fresh supply of his medicine he always looked
forward to these visits they talked about his mother
and the old place on the north shore of long island
which the doctor informed him was being subdivided
into suburban lots by the stoddard development com-
pany on one of these visits austin asked the phy-
sician if stoddard knew of his affliction

  no one knows about it except yourself and me the
physician replied you mustnt think of it in the
terms of an affliction if anything youre a grade above
the average both physically and mentally theres no
reason why you shouldnt live a long and useful life
what you need is an interest get that and forget the
other and youll be happy

  he went to his desk and opened a drawer from which
he took a slip of paper

  this is the prescription for your medicine he
said i meant to give it to you last time you were here
but i forgot you will find the address of the labora-
tory that prepares it on the reverse side dont lose
it in the event of my death theyll supply it to you
direct

  austin gripped the arms of his chair

  but youre not going to die-soon he said in sud-
den panic

  the physician smiled

  i hope not but one never knows he paused
and regarded his frightened young visitor sternly you
must stop depending upon others son go out and
mix with people make friends go into some sort of
business or learn a trade or a profession get away
from yourself learn to love work and to-love he
added

  i-i will austin replied as he folded up the slip
of paper and put it in his pocket

for days he thought about his talk with doctor
goldwin at home on long island his mother had
set aside a small plot of ground for him for a garden
he had loved this little spot on summer mornings
he would awaken while it was still dark and lie waiting
impatiently for the sun to rise and then bolt his break-
fast and hurry down to see how much his plants had
grown during the night he had felt an immense re-
sponsibility for their welfare when a spring gale
the grim inheritance



broke one of his young trees he had wept over it for
days a month later new shoots had appeared below
the break and the wound was healed over with rosin
on all sides he saw the constant feverish effort of all
loving things to create to perpetuate themselves against
great odds

  learn to love work and to-love doctor goldwin
had said it was odd that with this sentence running
through his mind austin should think of ann barrett
when he met her in the halls he felt the impulse to
gather her in his arms somehow she seemed to hold
within her small compact body the joy of creating the
promise of perpetuation

  he felt vaguely ashamed of himself he was in-
finitely better equipped for battle than the poor broken
tree

  the months that followed were busy ones for him
his talk with the physician awakened in him a desire
to know all about himself and the world into which he
had been so suddenly projected he spent his days
wandering about the city observing what men had done
while his mind had been asleep he spent his nights
in reading and study his ability to assimilate was
as great as his thirst for knowledge he saw noted
and mentally digested

  he had been with the stoddards a little over a year
when the first inkling of disaster came to him his
monthly allowance was cut off stoddard explained to
him in the library one evening a week or so later that
due to unfortunate conditions over which he had no
control the remnants of the crane fortune had been
swept away

  you mean that i have no money at all austin
asked

  stoddard replied that because of his mothers mis-
management such was the case but added magnani-
mously that austin was welcome to the hospitality of
his roof until he could find something to do austin
glanced at the mottled face of his distant relative the
mans small furtive eyes seemed to flit about the room
as if in an effort to evade his own the young man
wondered if the documents which he had signed now
and then at stoddards request during the past year
had anything to do with the loss of the money

  he went upstairs without a word he had seen
enough of poverty in his wanderings about town to
make him thoughtful beggars had stopped him now
and then with hands outstretched for alms depressing-
looking slinking creatures in soiled garments into
whose trembling palms he had dropped coins the
thought of what might become of him if there was
no money for his monthly supply of medicine made his
brain reel he clutched the bannister for support

  at a turn in the dark hall he was confronted by the
girl ann her finger was raised to her lips in an
admonitory gesture

  i was listening she whispered i heard what he
told you in the library oh why didnt i warn you
long ago he stole my money and now he has stolen
yours

  austin searched her face in the gloom his mind
was so full of his own problems that the significance
iof what she told him did not impress him at once

  he stole your money he reiterated

  yes yes the court made him my guardian after

my fathers death ten years ago im doing the work
of a servant here while they live in luxury on my
money

  austin drew a deep breath his distrust of stod-
dard flamed into suspicion then certitude in an instant
he looked down at the small face upturned to his in
the darkness pity for her made him forget his own
problems she seemed so small so abandoned he
did not know how it happened but somehow their lips
met and at that moment life with its infinite possibili-
ties was opened to him he kissed not only her lips
but her eyes and her hair and when he finally released
her frightened at his own vehemence she did not run
away they stood looking at one another as if a
miracle which their senses could not credit had been
performed before their eyes

  then at a sudden slamming of a door behind them
the girl turned and fled down the hall in the direction
of mrs stoddards suite

  dinner was being served when austin entered the
dining room that evening neither stoddard nor his
wife as much as glanced at him when he took his
accustomed seat opposite ann but he caught a quick
interchange of looks between them as he unfolded his
napkin the girl raised her eyes to his for a moment
then dropped them again hurriedly

  he ate mechanically and with no thought upon the
food stoddards conversation with his wife was mono-
syllabic as usual and he consumed his food with noisy
indelicacy his smooth flat skull gleamed dully in
the soft light his heavy face had the peculiar mottled
and flabby aspect of a toads belly and the toad-like
effect was further accentuated by the short neck upon
which his head was thrust forward slightly in advance
of the rest of his body

  he never seemed more repulsive to austin than
at this moment the young man felt a sudden impulse
to arise and denounce him and to sink his fingers into
the bovine neck the only thing that deterred him was
the warning glance from the brown eyes at the other
side of the table they seemed to say

  not yet bide your time plan think

  he slept not at all that night his brain was seething
with vague plans and half-formed ideas he had no
definite notion of what he intended to do he only
knew that the girls kisses still burned on his lips
for her sake he must find a way to bring stoddard
to account

crane secures employment

it was with this thing in mind that he approached
stoddard the following day with the request that
since he was now penniless he might take him
into his office to learn the real estate business stod-
dard regarded him in heavy-lidded silence before reply-
ing then said

  ill give you a try-out but mind you no foolish-
ness youve been pampered all your life i dont
pamper my employees ill give you a note to kraft
the office manager report for work to-morrow
austin found kraft a medium-sized very blond man
with a bulging forehead prominent glassy blue eyes
and a nervous jerky manner he was known among
his business associates as a booster he was always
on his toes about something even if that something


amazing stories

was merely an order for new typewriter ribbons he
expressed himself in detonations his simplest remarks
were minor explosions he prided himself upon a
brisk and business-like manner he was merely a gatling-
gun firing an unceasing barrage at some spot the range
of which was uncertain but which he hoped to hit by
the simple law of averages it never seemed to occur
to him that by purchasing a range-finder he could
have saved himself a lot of ammunition

  he put austin to work as a file clerk not because
he needed one but because stoddard had told him to
create this position the files of the stoddard devel-
opment and realty company were like all concerns of
this kind a simple record of sales made and of property
listed for sale they were consulted only upon enquiry
from some customer answering an advertisement or
to compute mr stoddards very large income tax the
stoddard company were specialists in their line real-
tors of the better kind was mr krafts slogan they
handled nothing but large business properties and
development projects running into six or seven figures

  austins clerkship consisted merely of half a dozen
trips a day to pull a card from the files and bring it
to mr krafts or mr stoddards desk the balance
of his time was taken up in running errands about
town these errands were many and varied such as
taking documents to the recorders office making de-
posits at the bank carrying papers to and from the
title companies delivering leases serving vacating no-
tices putting up rental placards on vacant properties
and for sale signs on empty plots

  he began to get some insight into how modern busi-
ness was conducted he learned observed and paid
close attention he knew that he was holding his posi-
tion at the stoddard firm on sufferance only and that
stoddard was watching for a slip as an excuse to dis-
charge him so he executed his commissions with dili-
gence and attention to the minutest detail his time
was limited sooner or later the axe would fall he
watched every move of the firm nothing escapecj him
he knew that an outright monetary reprisal wife out
of the question the firms business was done almost
entirely by checks and the limited amount of cash in
the office safe was not worth his while

  he found that stoddard did a good deal of trading
on his own account in high grade bonds and stocks
also that the firm was not always overscrupulous how
the offerers of them had come by them as long as they
were negotiable or bearer certificates and the price was
right in one instance he had been sent to the bank
to cash a large cheque the money some four thousand
dollars had been given to a hard-looking individual who
had been in long and earnest conversation with stod-
dard in his private office and who left behind him
a bundle of securities identical with those mentioned
in the headlines of a morning paper as having been
stolen in the robbery of a bonding house a few days
previously stoddard had put the bonds away in his
safe at once and later had removed them to his safe
deposit box at the bank this fact gave austin food
for thought

  certain plans had begun to form in his mind
they became crystallized almost at once when one
afternoon doctor goldwin summoned him to his
office

  ive some good news for you the old physician
told him doctor swartz from vienna will be here in
new york this summer his gland operations are
nothing short of surgical miracles i havent said
anything to you about him before because i did not
want to raise false hopes in you but after watching
his work for the past four or five years im convinced
that if you have the courage to submit to his knife
youll be permanently cured his fee is ten thousand
dollars i guess you can manage that sum ill have
a talk with mr stoddard about advancing you the
money

  austin held his breath the plan which he had
worked out would be frustrated if stoddard found out
about his affliction he considered momentarily the
wisdom of confiding in doctor goldwin about the
cutting off of his allowance but decided against it
his plans required that he play a lone hand the
possibilities which the physicians announcement of
doctor swartz visit held for him sent the blood
pounding to his temples his future ann life as a
normal human being the father of children-anns
children   

  ill see stoddard myself he said please dont
mention my-affliction to him ill get the money from
him on some pretext or other promise me that you
wont say anything to him about it he insisted
earnestly

  as you wish doctor goldwin replied he smiled
indulgently at what he thought was a display of sen-
sitiveness this is may doctor swartz will be
here early in august i want you to be ready for
him

  ill be ready for him austin said ill have ten
thousand dollars in your hands by the first of august

  very well you must rest during the month of
july in preparation for the operation get stoddard
to let you take your vacation early

  i will austin replied dont forget your prom-
ise stoddard must not know

  ive given you my word my boy the old physi-
cian said as he escorted him to the door

  once outside austin realized that he had committed
himself definitely to an obligation that would take all
his sagacity to live up to but the discovery that a
permanent cure was possible made all other things
possible he could go to ann with clean hands if
he had had any misgivings about the success of his
plan they were now swept aside

  there was no time to lose in putting the scheme in
operation his time was more limited than ever now
a certain amount of cash was necessary this he se-
cured from the pawning of his mothers jewels he
felt a stab of remorse at parting with them for even
a few months but he had to have money with the
proceeds he went to the fishing village on long island
near his old home and left instructions with the boat-
man there with whom he had left his sloop in charge
for the past year to overhaul the boat thoroughly for
a long cruise that summer -this and the stocking of
the boat with provisions took half of his limited capital

  he visited his old home while he was negotiating
the repairs on the boat the fine old grounds had
been subdivided into building plots and rows of small
cottages all alike as peas shut off the view of the
the grim inheritance



sound from the once wooded slopes knowing what
he did of business now he marveled at his own
credulity in signing the papers which stoddard had
submitted to him from time to time and to which he
austin had put his signature without as much as glanc-
ing at them he saw how completely his utter ignor-
ance of business had delivered him into stoddards
hands the man would hardly have been human to
resist the temptation

  austin shed a tear or two for the fate of the old
home then set his face resolutely toward the future

the weeks that followed were busy ones for him
as he worked during the day only his evenings
were available for his preparations at a store in the
bowery district he purchased an entire new outfit of
cheap flashy clothes a tie that only a race track tout
would have dared to wear a soft fedora hat with
brightly colored band and a pair of light tan button
shoes that shrieked to heaven he also purchased a
pair of dark eye glasses of the variety known collo-
quially as rubber-tired

  these things he carried to the sloop in a suitcase and
stowed away in the small cabin when the repairs on
the boat had been consummated he sailed the little
craft into the east river one sunday past hell-gate
and moored it in the angle of one of the piers at the
foot of eighty-sixth street near the ferry dock the
stoddard house was in the eighties just off fifth
avenue a run of less than ten minutes on the eighty-
sixth street crosstown bus from where the yawl was
moored

  his last move was to purchase a five hundred dollar
bond of a certain public utilities corporation with the
remainder of his money the bond was one of those
standard securities in which widows invest their life
insurance money and which are as negotiable and
almost as safe as united states treasury notes

  it was early in june when all his preparations were
perfected he went over everything in detail every
step he meant to take was planned out the audacity
and boldness of the plan augured well for its success

  on the evening of the fifth of june he approached
stoddard with the request that his summer vacation
begin that following saturday the alacrity with
which stoddard granted the request amused him he
was not needed at the stoddard development and
realty company and knew that he was kept on merely
because stoddard was just a little bit afraid of him

  i would like to run down to bermuda in the yawl
i may be gone two months or so if you have no objec-
tion austin told him

  stoddards heavy lips parted in a wolfish smile he
considered how he could turn this circumstance to his
own account when austin returned by letting the
young man out on the plea that business was not what
it ought to be at any rate it gave him an excellent
opening to dispense with his proteges services

  take as long as you like he replied with a mag-
nanimous wave of his pudgy hand

  thank you sir said austin gravely

  he had a long talk with ann that evening in a se-
cluded corner of central park where he had asked
her to meet him he told her many things some of
which stirred her to wonder and filled her dark eyes

with tenderness and others that made her fearful for
him

  he waved her fears aside they clung to each other
in the dusk of the warm spring evening when they
parted she said

  even if you do not raise the money for the opera-
tion we can work together and save until we have
enough nothing matters except that i love you
there are others to think of he replied as he
kissed her tenderly and fiercely in the same breath
for their sake ive got to win

  the following saturday he packed up a few neces-
sary things and departed for his yawl moored at the
foot of eighty-sixth street his mind became filled
with a sort of subtle intoxication as he began to put
his plan into operation he had no intention of going
to bermuda for a month or so he simply stayed
aboard the well-provisioned and comfortable little craft
and proceeded to deprive himself of his medicine
with the memory in his mind of the image he had
seen in the cheval mirror of his room when his mother
and doctor gold win had brought him back from
gloucester the procedure took every ounce of will
power he possessed the inforced inactivity of one
month which was necessary to accomplish sufficient
retrogression to make him unrecognizable would have
appalled a less determined man the result would
have made a heart less stout than his fail

                                                 

a strange visitor

it was on a very hot afternoon in the first days of
july that stoddard perspiring in his shirt sleeves
in his office received a bulky special delivery let-
ter he ran his stubby forefinger under the flap of
the envelope wondering mildly what its contents might
be when a five hundred dollar negotiable bond of a
certain well-known public utilities corporation dropped
into his hand his pale blue eyes lighted with sudden
interest and the interest was heightened by the con-
tents of the typed letter which accompanied it

  mr j c stoddard new york city he read
dear sir-a pal of mine-never mind who-ad-
vised me that you would be in the market for securities
of this kind if the price was right i have 
worth of them and my price is right thirty-three per
cent discount for cash if not interested please re-
turn the enclosed sample at once

          sincerely yours

                         joseph scanlon

general delivery new york

  stoddard dabbed his bald skull with a damp purple-
bordered silk handkerchief he turned the certificate
over examined it closely and held it up to the light
it was undoubtedly genuine it carried six and one-
quarter per cent interest and was worth he knew fully
one hundred cents on the dollar he considered the
letter ponderously two -hundred thousand dollars
worth of these bonds at a discount of thirty-three per
cent would have netted him sixty-six thousand dollars
a very nice profit but stoddard was not a man to be
satisfied with a nice profit in a deal that contained the
elements of a clean-up he knew that men who of-
fered bonds of this kind at a knock down price were not
in a position to dictate so he came back at mr


amazing stories

joseph scanlon general delivery new york with an
offer of thirty-three cents on the dollar instead of thirty-
three per cent discount

  mr scanlons answer was a typewritten howl of pro-
test he cut his price to forty per cent discount
stoddard raised his offer to forty cents on the dollar
they finally compromised on fifty cents partly be-
cause the sum represented by this amount-or -
- was within two thousand dollars of all the cash
stoddard possessed in the world and perhaps partly
because the writer of the letter was aware of this fact

  mr scanlon explained that as for reasons of ex-
pediency he was lying low in the bowery district
and did not care to be abroad in daylight because the
sun hurt his eyes he would call at mr stoddards
home address which had been given him by their mutual
friend with the package of bonds further that if
mr stoddard would have the hundred thousand in a
certified cheque ready for him at say eleven oclock
on a certain night the deal could be consummated
without any fuss or feathers

  mr stoddard agreed to all this except on one count
he was a careful man a certified cheque would con-
stitute a legal record of a transaction that might cause
him some little embarrassment to explain away to an
inquisitive prosecutor if mr scanlon should recover
from his eye trouble and venture forth in broad day-
light the cash would be on hand in large bills he
stated by return mail

  mr scanlon replied that although he hated to carry
such a sum on his person after dark in a city like new
york full of unscrupulous characters he would abide
by mr stoddards decision as a postscript he added
that hed bring two pals along to watch outside the
house and that if mr stoddard knew what was good
for him he wouldnt try any rough stuff or he mr
scanlon would make it his business to put a lily in his
mr stoddards hand forthwith

  mr stoddard smiled grimly at this horticultural post-
script these underworld characters were a suspicious
lot he could afford to smile he had no intention of
pulling any rough stuff he was quite satisfied with a
profit of one hundred thousand dollars and a whole
skin

  he did however take the precaution of having the
money to pay for the bonds delivered to his residence
by an armored delivery car company and immediately
transferred it to his wall safe in the library

  at eleven oclock that evening the agreed time his
door bell rang he answered it himself the man
whom he let into the darkened hall wore a soft felt
hat with a brightly colored band pulled down over
his eyes dark tortoise-shell eyeglasses a blue double-
breasted suit with broad stripes and a pair of light tan
shoes under his arm he carried a bundle done up in
common brown wrapping paper mr stoddards swift
glance of scrutiny noted the ominous bulge of the right
hand pocket of the striped jacket

  mr joseph scanlon i assume he asked pleas-
antly

  the man nodded he stood for a moment peering
about the darkened hall in a listening attitude

  come into the library stoddard said leading the
way were all alone he added reassuringly my
wife is out and the servants have gone to bed

the man followed him slowly without a word he
walked with the peculiar shuffling gait of advanced
age seated opposite in the better-lighted library stod-
dard got his first good look at him he was a singu-
larly depressing-looking man the skin of his face
which was of a waxy pallor seemed to hang in folds
that apparently could not be smoothed out it gave
him a peculiar wizened look in spite of the fact that
he was quite evidently a young man although well
above middle height he gave the appearance somehow
of being shrunken and his movements and speech were
abnormally deliberate he sat staring at stoddard
through his darkened eyeglasses his lower lip droop-
ing askew in an uncanny half imbecile way

  lets see the bonds he said finally

  lets see the jack the other replied forcing out
each word slowly in a hoarse voice as if the mere act of
speaking was an effort

  stoddard pointed to the wall-safe its in there
he held out his hands for the brown paper package
the man made no movement he said merely lets-
see-it

  stoddard made a motion of impatience

  i play square he said

  the man reached for his hat as if to leave

  all right stoddard grumbled ill show it to you
he went to the safe and opened it then flipped the
bundle of bills in the light of the table lamp before
laying them down

  the mans wizened hand holding the brown paper
package moved forward slowly he pushed the parcel
across the table to stoddard then put the hand into the
bulging right hand pocket of his jacket and leaned back
in his chair

  stoddard tore the brown paper off the parcel he
found that it contained some half a dozen neatly folded
newspapers of a very recent issue

  what-whats this- he raised his head with
an angry snarl but the snarl turned to amazement
when he found himself looking into the bore of an
automatic pistol which at the distance of the six feet
that separated him from his visitor looked to his bulging
eyes like the end of a section of drain pipe

  pass-me-the-jack the man said in his slow
emotionless voice

  mr stoddards lower jaw dropped wide his pudgy
hand moved to the bundle of currency then came
away with a quick cat-like movement as if it had been
turned he took a step backward and slumped into
his chair and sat staring at his visitor with the beads
of perspiration streaming down his mottled face

  the man arose slowly reached for the money and
put it into his pocket he stood looking at stoddard
for a moment then said in his peculiar hoarse brittle
voice

  the telephone-wires-are-cut stay-where-
you-are-f or-five-minutes- or-my-pals-will-
get you

  without another word he backed out and left the room
slowly when stoddard heard the front door close
upon him he arose halfway in his seat but fear made
him drop back he knew that men of joseph scan-
lons type would stop at nothing

he sat staring at the bundle of newspapers on the

graves y jyvllifier

by george frederick stratton

 judging from all the talk about conquering gravitation and space bying
 it would seem that nullifying gravity would be of only one advantage
 that is not so a multitude of other benefits would be derived from the
 discovery of the secret or from an invention to enable man to free himself
 from gravity many of us are watching for something in that direction with
 keen interest but notwithstanding einsteins work we hardly know where
 to begin to attack the problem

                  m lundholm the imperious president of
           the uinta power and light company glared at the
           photograph the wrinkles in his square strong forehead
           drawn together in a cynical frown of doubt

 is this-er-thing he demanded of hidreth his
 chief construction engineer who had just handed him the picture

   well no but its one of the countless proofs of the power of
 the thing you remember the genie of fairy book fame who had
 no power until liberated from the bottle well this fellow performs
 his stunts while still imprisoned in a two by four box houdinis arts
 are not wanted the contraption you are looking at is in the mouth
 of the ophengo canyon which opens out of the foothills where
 graves house is its a blind canyon no trail up and no water on
 one side as you see theres an almost perpendicular cliff and twelve
 hundred feet up that cliff theres an acre or two of flat bench

    off that ledge graves has projected two steel beams to carry those
 upper wheels these are grooved wheels eight feet in diameter
 keyed to the ends of an eight-foot shaft and each carries an endless
 steel cable from similar wheels twelve
 hundred feet below and fastened be-
 tween those cables are barrels-ordinary
 whiskey barrels i guess-so that as one

 she shifted
 the lever
 and the en-
 tire outfit
 of barrels
 began to
 move slow- s
 ly quickly
 gaining
 speed

amazing stories

line is coming down the other is going up

  and that line of barrels going up mr lundholm
has its gravity entirely nullified until each barrel passes
over the top wheel then it regains its normal weight
which is all used for the downward pull

  h-mp then as i understand it hidreth this fel-
low claims that the ascending line of barrels has no
weight while the descending line has-well-how
much 

   there are no less than three hundred barrels on each
side mr lundholm theyre filled with wet sand and
the total weight on the descending line cannot be much
less than two hundred thousand pounds the shaft at
the foot of the cliff carries as you see a three-ton fly-
wheel on one end and a driving pulley on the other
whats he driving with it  asked the president
nothing he says that he built the outfit simply as
a model for demonstration that he could belt it to gen-
erators or sawmills or anything and give three or four
thousand horsepower some little model eh mr lund-
holm 

  the president made no response to that the muscles
of his wrists were rigid as bronze as he grasped the arms
of his chair and in a voice astringent with irony he
asked

   do you believe all he tells you hidreth 

  i cannot-and-yet-i do retorted the engineer
i cannot believe the man graves is a faker i knew
him well when i was on the staff of the ensign machine
company in denver we took him into the experi-
mental department because he was an inventive genius
and he never said anything that wasnt just so he is
the man who invented that marvelous mind revealer
that the international telephone company took up you
know

   an intense grin came over the presidents face sure
i remember old jake hindleman told me about it
they paid a hundred thousand dollars for that inven-
tion and if it had been a fake graves wouldnt have
needed any gravity nullifier old jake would have
kicked him out of the reach of gravity all right

  an appreciative grin came over the engineers face
and there was a pause then lundholms features
stiffened into their usual determined furrows and he
seized his phone

  get me graves sam graves at the ophongo can-
yon

  when the connection was made he asked is mr
graves there 

   

  this is president lundholm of the uinta power
company ive just been talking with our engineer
and wed like to look a little further into your-er
gravity outfit

	  

yes i see well be out there this afternoon

  he hung up his receiver and turned to hidreth his
wife answered graves went to chicago on last nights
train and wont be back for a week or ten days but she
says that if we go out she can show us the controller
as she calls it

  h-mp grunted the engineer thoughtfully i
wonder if hes got chicago parties on the string i told
him i felt sure that youd look into it without much de-
lay and he didnt express any impatience at all said

he thought denver parties were the logical men to capi-
talize the thing

  there hes right exclaimed lundholm all the
same i dont like this trip to chicago if the thing is
genuine-if he can really control gravitation-even in
a small degree it will be the biggest thing the world has
ever seen mind cannot conceive its limits and east-
ern capital is grabbing every good thing here

  hidreth nodded slowly say it gets me the same
way i didnt sleep two hours last night-thinking of
it every moment almost the last thing i saw before
i left graves yesterday was way across the plains a
long train of loaded coal cars being started on the track
and the exhaust reports came only about ten a minute
graves said indifferently if i went over there with
this controller box and connected to that string of cars
with an insulated coupling to the locomotive it would
start them all as easily as if it were only one light
caboose 

  then slamming his fist on the table he added and
it would lundholm if gravity can be eliminated or
controlled

  the president nodded gravely then in a low but
intense tone he murmured its no more wonderful
and perhaps as possible as sending a hundred thousand
horsepower over a wire no bigger than this pencil lets
go hidreth

  with the presidents -cylinder car they covered
the  miles from denver to the ophongo canyon in
less than an hour as they ran slowly up the sage-
brush trail from the highway to graves bungalow the
inventors wife daintily dressed swung her little figure
from the porch hammock and murmured to herself
smilingly here comes the big fellow mr george
m lundholm multimillionaire president of six or
eight great companies and on the directorate of a dozen
more gee i wonder if i can behave properly and
will i be up against the cold glassy stare

  she glided down the steps as the car stopped and
with a radiant smile said im not going to wait for
an introduction gentlemen because theres no one here
to introduce me welcome to our glorious city and
the rest waving her pretty arm towards the giant
mountains the snow-tipped peaks glittering in the sun

  lundholm bowed courteously i believe i scowled
a little mrs graves when i heard that your husband
was away but now im intensely glad i suppose if
he had been here we should have gone right on to the
canyon and then missed seeing you

  thats very nice mr lundholm all the same im
sorry sam isnt here he had to go to chicago to get
some valve or gasket or something for a speed gov-
ernor hes making for the gravity plant its about a
half mile up there shall we ride over

  she called to a tall man in overalls who placed a
small but heavy box in her own car which was parked
there and started towards the mountains while she en-
tered the presidents car a few minutes over a rough
trail of sage-brush and huge boulders brought them to
the foot of the stupendous cliffs at the canyon mouth
and a sharp turn at the base ran them close to the huge
flywheel on the power shaft

  edna sprang from the car and tossed a kiss at the
two strings of barrels hanging from the curious struc-
ture twelve hundred feet up that appalling precipice
sam graves gravity nullifier



thats the way i feel she laughed thats the re-
alization of sammys dream and its wonderful mr
lundholm sure wonderful

  he nodded gravely a little spasm of indignation
sweeping over him that he a great capitalist involved in
the biggest industries of the west should be compelled
to listen to the gush of a bit of a woman like this

  but she fluttered over to a small wooden building
eight by ten feet in size close to the driving pulley of
the gravity plant followed by the mechanic who un-
locked the door and threw open a shutter across the
front of the building

  this is our control department she smiled and
this pointing to the box which the mechanic had placed
on the floor is the nullifier-sam calls it

  with amazing deftness she connected a wire from
the electric light service wire to the one end of the box
then connected the other end to a plain switchboard on
the wall there were two circular switch levers above
one was a rough inscription ascending over the
other was descending

  grasping one lever edna replied ill start it mr
lundholm you see all the barrels now have their
normal weights and of course theres no movement until
we cut out some weight from the ascending side now
look

  she shifted the lever and the entire outfit of barrels
began to move slowly quickly gaining speed

  i dare not nullify any more she explained or the
speed would get beyond control

  the two men watched intently the now rapidly mov-
ing lines and the whirling flywheel a rude but power-
ful lever brake was pressing on that great wheel and
was being controlled by the mechanic for a few min-
utes they all silently watched the movement once or
twice edna threw back her switch until the line almost
stopped then she threw in the nullifier again and
speeded up

  the controls good she exclaimed excitedly if
anything was belted on we could instantly nullify all
the gravity from that ascending line and get all the
power possible from the descending line do you un-
derstand

  perfectly replied lundholm its quite simple
except one thing the nullifier that is an unseen
miracle

  seems so to me she responded but then im
not a scientist i havent the faintest idea how that
current is changed in that box to do such marvelous
work ive seen the mechanism and the windings of
course-could assemble it all myself i think if neces-
sary but why or how it acts that way is beyond me
and to tell the truth mr lundholm its beyond
sammy-my husband he doesnt know any more
about that part of it than you or i

  how was it possible then for him to design or in-
vent the machine-the nullifier mrs graves 

  how was it possible for marconi to devise wire-
less she retorted with a bewitching smile or for
other big scientific men to send millions of horsepower
through a tiny wire  they dont even know yet what
the juice is do they

  lundholm nodded gravely that is about so mrs
graves

  she added earnestly they have found that current

would rush itself over a wire but theyve never found
out how

  im going to show you something else she smiled
you dont know now for sure that the gravity is really
eliminated from some of those barrels there may be
some fake dont you think ill show you

  she rapidly disconnected the nullifier and ordered the
mechanic to carry it over to the presidents big car fol-
lowing it herself with a small coil of wire the mechanic
ascended the electric light pole and connected one end
of that wire while she quickly connected the other end
to the nullifier and the nullifier to the rear of the car

  dont fear for your car mr lundholm weve
tested it with our own a score of times

  pulling on a big rubber glove she grasped the front
end of that car and lifted it as high as her sparkling
eyes it doesnt weigh a pound you see try it
yourself

  he did so and the keen estimating look which he
had worn before and which was not without a touch
of hard suspicion disappeared in its place came a
glare of utter amazement as he lifted the end of the
great car as high as his head without an effort

  he relinquished it to hidreth strode over to edna
and held out his hand im thoroughly convinced mrs
graves thoroughly that test is absolutely con-
clusive

  she disconnected the nullifier again and the man took
it to her car the two engineers had strolled over to
the foot of the barrel outfit silently gazing at it

  its a crude arrangement she said as she joined
them those barrels were the handiest weight carriers
we could get and the sand was lying all around us sam
is making an automatic speed governor thats what hes
gone to chicago for-to get some parts say let me
tell you how he built that supporting platform way up
there the man who helped will tell the same story

  you see there was no way to get even a pack mule
up there the men cut out a trail and scrambled up
with what tools they needed but those beams weigh
nearly two tons apiece the men just rigged a wooden
derrick with a light hoisting rope and then sam nullified
those beams and one man pulled them up as easily as
if they had been made of cork it was the same with
the big wheels and the cables savvy 

  i savvy all right murmured the president

  on the short run back to the bungalow lundholm
asked mrs graves do those men who helped and
that mechanic whos with us know anything about the
nullifier

  no more than you do mr lundholm no one but
sam and myself has ever had one little look into that
box

  thats good he muttered then after a long
pause as soon as your husband gets back telephone
me if you please and well arrange for a conference
this matter will i think have to be very carefully
handled

  all right mr lundholm well be ready

  and your husband has applied for a patent of
course  perhaps you have a copy of the specifications
and drawings if so wed like to have a chance to look
them over it would save time of course

  he hasnt applied for a patent sir he made out
the specifications and drawings but i persuaded him not


amazing stories

to go so far yet i think i showed him that it was far
wiser to keep the process secret-at present at least
you you advised him that the president dis-
played almost as much amazement as when he lifted his
own car with one hand then a grim smile came over
his face i thought a woman-most women-never
absolutely kept a secret

  she tossed her little head and pouted perhaps that
is so mr lundholm but ive had some office-training
with men-real men the cartwright cattle company-
and ive learned what it means sometimes to keep a
secret

  the puzzled look came back into his eyes and he lifted
his hat courteously and drove away with his engineer
while edna sought out a box of chocolates snuggled
into the hammock again and opened a well-worn note-
book murmuring joyfully let us see what ive got
about mr george lundholm

she fingered over the leaves until she found the clip-
ping she sought it was from a denver daily and
read

  in a recent interview with george m lundholm the
millionaire president of several great industries in the
intermountain region he said never since i started
on my career have i been in anything in which i had not
secured complete control when i cannot secure that i
let the whole matter severely alone

  she laughed roguishly that means that he wont
play unless he has a perfectly good hand and bret
harte says life aint th holdin of a good hand but
th playin of a poor hand well m-mp i think that
sammy and i are going to see some life pronto

  a week later she was telling her husband of the
presidents visit she finished with so you see sam-
ivel that lundholm wont come in unless he has full
control-he thinks

  what of that retorted sam if he buys outright
let him have all the control he wants thats his busi-
ness  sell him for a million dollars if hell give it if
not make it a quarter million or a half

  a million dollars she gasped only one little
million for a new power of world-wide application 
its all we want edna ive got other things on my
mind thatll bring in more

  just like an inventor she laughed a little bitterly
no business instincts at all almost unlimited wealth
in your grasp and youre sidetracking yourself to make
other inventions

  well my girl you cant get even that million without
giving control with it but capital wont come in any
other way

her eyes flashed and she said eagerly you say i
cant do it do you mean that youll leave it to me 
sure do you can play the hand if you like im
not afraid of your losing all and i dont want to be
bothered with it

  that goes sammy just dont trump my aces and
ill see that the score builds up to a respectable size
im not playing on a little million dollar limit watch
me

  she presented herself a few days later at president
lundholms office and was received courteously but
with an evident expression of doubt and surprise
hasnt mr graves returned yet he asked

  oh yes but hes very busy on that automatic gov-
ernor mr lundholm and he doesnt want to waste time
on business details he said so he sent me

  instantly there came a suspicion to the presidents
mind and a fierce scowl swept over his face as he
thought it possible that the damned fool sent his wife
here to vamp me to squeeze a few thousand more out
of me with pretty smiles and childish talk hell
then flashing as quickly as a movie picture change
came another thought its their ignorance of any
gleam of the real value of the thing the fools sending
her into town to sell it-to sell this prodigious value-
just the same as he sends her in to buy a pound of tea
and box of crackers theyre pikers and acting like
pikers and theyre surely my meat

  i hope youre not disappointed mr lundholm
she murmured as she noted the black cloud over him
sam is an inventor he knows and cares little for
business he always leaves such things to me i am
sure that i can tell you plainly what we propose

  he felt jubilant this was going to be much easier
than he had expected all right mrs graves i sup-
pose youve brought the drawings and specifications
with you

  she shook her head and smiled no sir we de-
cided that we would not reveal the secret until a real
company was formed and we were paid what we think
right

  good lord mrs graves can it be possible that
you expect me to waste my time in organizing a com-
pany and looking up capital for something i know
absolutely nothing about

  youve seen what it will do mr lundholm
capital hasnt seen it he retorted grimly what
sort of fool would i look to ask men to put up perhaps
two or three hundred thousand to exploit some machine
thats locked up in a box and which i dont know is
metal or er-legerdemain ridiculous we may as
well end this interview right now mrs graves i am
a pretty busy man

  she smiled bewitchingly youre also a man of big
reputation mr lundholm and too good a sport to
throw up your hand without seeing a little further into
the game

  perhaps she hit him right anyway a curious twinkle
came into his eyes whats the ante mrs graves 
not even a white chip sir until you see those papers
and drawings heres our proposition you form a
company with ten million dollars capital and pay us six
millions in stock for the patents when that company
is incorporated and the stock paid in well give you all
drawings and specifications apply for the patent and
assign it to you

  he gasped as he slumped back in his chair and the
term pikers went before his eyes in circles presently
he sneered

  and suppose that patent is never allowed 

  ive thought of that please -you can put our six
million dollars of stock in trust somewhere to be de-
livered to us when that patent is allowed-not before
isnt that fair

  he scowled again without answering the question
the sum you mention is absurd quite out of the ques-
tion make it a million capitalization-you take forty
per cent for the patents and ill talk to you
sam graves gravity nullifier



  oh dear no sir if it was only yoti we were to deal
with we might do something like that but with a
company we never know who are friends and who are
-are schemers we must retain control

  beneath the smiles the roguish curves of the lips
the almost girlish pleading in the tones he saw a de-
termination in the eyes and chin which surprised him
he grimly smiled as he remembered and i thought
they were pikers then

  of course your figure is absurd  youre estimating
what the invention will do far above its merits now
look what special saving would there be with your
-er-barrel power plant over a hydraulic plant water
costs nothing the entire cost is in the harnessing and
youve got to spend about as much to harness your
gravity nullifier

  she gasped a little at that thought and he followed
up his point

  you spoke the other day of its revolutionizing
transportation how would it youve got to transport
goods even if a carload doesnt weigh a pound and it
costs nearly as much to run empties as to run loaded
cars the tracks rolling stock and personnel all have
to be there besides how would you keep trains on
the tracks if they had no weight

  its the same with vessels if a hold is full of
freight that has no weight the ship would have to take
in ballast and if you nullify the gravitation of one youll
do it with all no vessels would ever untie from a
wharf with practically empty bottoms how would
you move stuff youd destroy all transportation in-
stead of helping it

but she had recovered herself now and smiled
frankly those are good talking points mr
lundholm but i have some good ones too how about
steam power with its tremendous cost of great engines
and enormous consumption of coal and oil how
about using nullifiers on great construction operations
building skyscrapers great dams and bridges how
about getting minerals and coal up two or three thous-
and foot shafts  besides there may be development of
control which will make it fully as useful in transpor-
tation

  you havent shown any indication of it yet mrs
graves

  we surely have dont we take the gravity out of
just what barrels we choose to up there at the canyon
and leave those we choose to normal 

  but how

  i didnt call your attention to that sir those bar-
rels are connected in groups of twenty and we can
turn the nullifier current into any one of those groups
without affecting the others

  how about the cables mrs graves dont they
carry the current 

  theyre insulated from it you noticed that every
barrel has an iron tube running clear through it the
ends projecting about a foot from each end those
tubes hold the barrels to the cables but where they are
fastened to the cables they are in solid rubber insula-
tions

  i see he murmured of course other improve-
ments may be made the thing has some value but-

  there he paused and his brow was heavily corrugated
and his eyes half closed i tell you what ill do id
rather keep this in private control for the present i
have two propositions ill capitalize an ample factory
to manufacture the nullifiers and develop a trade for
them and give you half the profits or ill give you
two and a half millions outright for the patents when
they are secured

  she scarcely pondered for a moment i think wed
rather take the cash if it was five millions instead of
two and a half i really believe that your offer of half
profits would pay better but i suppose im a little bit
like mr edison did you ever hear what he once said 
ill show you

  she took her little notebook from her bag turned to
a clipping and read  thomas edison once said i al-
ways play my blue chips first i think of the biggest
thing that could be done and try to do that many men
take twenty years to get where they should have started
the first day

  thats the way i feel mr lundholm we might get
two or three times five millions in twenty years but
were going to play our blue chips first savvy
again his eyes half closed and the deep corrugations
wrinkled his forehead as he muttered to himself and
this is the woman i thought a piker or a little mar-
ried flapper trying to play business

  he glanced at her keenly the shrewd keen cold
eyes the thin tightly compressed lips the obtrusive
chin of the business woman were not there in the
slightest degre priding himself as he always had in
his ability to quickly estimate any man he found himself
utterly bewildered by this attractive little woman in her
sport skirt her brushed wool sweater and jaunty hat
pressed down on curly head so firmly that only the
twinkling innocent eyes peeped at him from under the
narrow brim

  presently he grunted i guess it will have to be as
you say he pressed a button and when his stenog-
rapher appeared said

  jim take down an agreement two copies

  he dictated and when the typewritten copies were
ready handed one to edna who read it carefully she
handed it back

  the last clause mr lundholm reads any im-
provements or additions made at any time by the said
samuel graves shall become the property of the said
george m lundholm without cost to him

  there should be added to that sir that the cost of
experimenting and making such improvements will be
paid by you

  he laughed grimly to the last pound of flesh eh 
make that change jim

  then with a very earnest expression he added if
you had accepted my first offer i should have suggested
that you become an active partner in the business-the
business manager in fact you have just the qualifi-
cations for this particular thing i dont mind telling
you now that i decided before to limit my offer to a
million or perhaps a million and a half and youve
forced me to raise my ante to five millions

  yes she laughed but dont forget that you take
the whole pot mr lundholm

was grave

  youve heard the news i suppose the old physician

stoddard and company have failed he told austin
about the robbery and gave him the details of the fail-

 self to cover up his embezzlements of your money and
 the girl ann barretts his description of the alleged
 bandit was so fantastic that the authorities smelled a
 rat and took charge of his books im afraid my boy
 that youll never get a red cent out of the mess

   austin drew a deep breath

   it was lucky i got the ten thousand out of him before
 i left he said you think that the operation will be
 a success doctor im banking on it i want to get
 married-to ann barrett

  the doctor cleared his throat he seemed to be
thinking

   theres not the slightest doubt about it my boy
 he said finally im more than ever convinced since
 my talk with doctor swartz a few days ago he
 paused im glad the little girl will be provided for i
 was wondering what was going to become of her

   austin smiled

  shes got a little money laid by that stoddard
failed to get his hands on he replied well make

   the old physician gave him a quick appraising look
 his wise old eyes held austins for a moment then he
 drew his breath in sharply as if an idea had suddenly
 struck him

editor amazing stories

about a year and a half ago a group of boys
and myself were standing by a newsstand making
fun of the names of cheap magazines placed there-
on when suddenly one of our number pointed at
one magazine and began guffawing in a most
amusing manner the magazine was called
amazing stories we all joined in and laughed
with him intending to have more fun i picked
up the magazine and examined the cover i was
puzzled the picture was not in keeping with the
name of the magazine merely out of curiosity i
opened the magazine and saw the first illustration
it astounded me with its wealth of scientific detail
my eye quickly jumped to the title of the story
the comet doom i mused scientific maga-
zine i said aloud then eagerly i turned the
pages until i came to the second illustration i
believe i yelled aloud because it was also scien-
tific a magazine dealing with the subjects i
loved i turned the pages eagerly scanning each
of the illustrations with ever increasing interest
i began reading one of the stories and uncon-
sciously began walking home reading when sud-
denly a loud harsh voice with a foreign accent rent
the still evening air hey dere vot you doing
bring back der magazine awakening from my
trance i turned to see the irate newsdealer yell-
ing for me to return the magazine to its rack

return it i thought never i gladly paid him
the required amount by sheer will power i
closed the magazine while i ran home i collided
with three people and didnt even turn my head
dashing into the house and throwing my cap some-
where i dived for the couch and with expectant
eyes i scanned once more the now precious pages
i have not missed an issue since that day

  there has been so much intelligent comment on
all of the issues up to the april number that there
is little left for a  year old boy to say however
in the story the worm a worm is supposed to
have grown to colossal proportions almost the
width of a house and much longer according to
j b s haldanes essay on being the right
size in his book entitled possible worlds this
would be highly improbable because a worm has
a skin through which all of the oxygen it requires
can soak in a straight gut with sufficient surface
to absorb its food and a simple kidney increase
its dimensions tenfold in every direction and its
weight is increased a thousand times so that if it
is to use its muscles as efficiently as its miniature
counterpart it will need a thousand times as much
food and oxygen per day and will excrete a thou-
sand times as much of waste products

  now if its shape is unaltered its surface will be
increased only a hundredfold and ten times as
much oxygen must enter per minute through each
square millimetre of skin and ten times as much
food must pass through each millimetre of in-
testine

  the skylark of space was absolutely the best
scientifiction story i have ever read anywhere
one of your readers wondered why the occupants
of the skylark would need heavy wrappings
the atmosphere it is known exerts a pressure of
 lbs per square inch and the human body in
order to preserve its contour would have to exert
an equal pressure against the atmosphere he
mentions that there is almost no pressure and the
human body exerting its outward pressure would
swell and eventually burst maybe they did need
the suits the skylark plays havoc with ein-
steins theory einstein holds that an object as it
gains speed diminishes in size until it reaches the
speed of light and then it ceases to exist also he
contends that if one could travel as the speed of
light time would stand still that is to say
that if a clock coud travel at the speed of light
the hands would not turn while it was traveling at
this speed because no time would elapse

  into the green prism was the most enjoyable
story you have published since the skylark of
space a hyatt verrill is my favorite author
there are a few things however that puzzled me
the minute people he says were uncrushable be-
cause they were scarcely larger than atoms if
this were the case why did not they fall through
the relatively spacious molecular structure of
the earth would they not be hammered to
death by the vibrations of the molecules of the
earth ramon mentions also that each molecule of

  have been present this being so no loss of

  the concentration of their original weight on such
  a small area as that upon which they stood would
  have forced them into the earth do you not

  curred each year it seemed a bit queer to have

  there seems to be an argument about whether
  or not inertia is present in a body free from the
  effects of gravity i am no dyed in the wool
  scientist but i contend that inertia is ever present
  in a body it always takes force to start or stop
  a body a balloon that has the same weight as an
  equal volume of air may be used as an example of
  a body that is free from the effects of gravity if
  in a strong wind you throw this balloon upward its
  inertia will tend to make it move in a straight line
  away from your hand the balloon will not travel
  with the wind as soon as it leaves your hand but
  it will resist the winds effect and describe an arc
  before it travels wholly with the wind

  one of your readers thinks a shadow three
  dimensional but i contend that he cannot even
  think about a shadow because it does not exist
  shade is the absence of light and nothing else
  you do not even see a real shadow its outline is
  determined by surrounding light

  the illustrations are fine but we need more of
  them to relieve our overworked imaginations i

  i think that we of the discussions department
  should start a correspondence club and discuss
  various scientific subjects

  you object to the worm growing so terribly
  large in the story of that name but would it not
  be possible that so large a worm would have a
  more active skin both internal and external but
  whatever criticism your views on the physiology
  of the worm may be it is interesting to see that
  your arithmetic is very accurate many people do
  not understand the relation of cubic contents to
  the superficial area as you do

  a sudden withdrawal of all pressure from a
  human body might have disastrous effects but the
  body would not explode unless the change was in-
  stantaneous

  several communications touch on into the
  green prism it is open to criticism we know
  if we accept the modern theories of the constitution
  of matter as being definitely and fixedly right but
  we must remember that these views are changing
  from year to year and when anyone is writing so
  beautiful a story and with so much poetry in it
  we should gladly allow him some poetic license

  inertia is quite independent of gravity and it is
  always present in matter there you are per-
  fectly right in your contention

  as regards the shadow we do not see how you
  can get nearer the idea of two dimensions than by
  this absence of light as you term it

  as regards the correspondence club we publish
  the names and addresses of our correspondents so
  that there will be no difficulty in starting such a
  club as you propose why dont you try it we
  will be glad to publish in amazing stories the

the path taken by space travel-
lers in a vessel will nullify
gravity

editor amazing stories

  when you said that the face of isis would
become a target for criticism you were right
that is the object of this letter

  when reading a story i like to imagine it could
really happen under certain conditions and this is
what i thought of mr wates yarn until i came
to the place where the professor revokes wells
theory concerning what a body screened from the
earths attraction would do this apparently
learned man i e the professor states that if a
body were released from the earths gravitation it
would fly off at a tangent to the revolving earth
which is very true however mr wates must
have considered that the earth would stop revolving
when he said that the body would fly along the
earths surface and straight into space because if
a condition like the one stated were possible it
would be found that the body would rise vertically
from the earths surface or at least would seem
to do so to any person in it because the earth
would revolve on its axis as swiftly as the space
car would fly off therefore the car would not go
faster than the earth from the nullification of the
earths attraction as mr wates would have us
believe in fact the car might even seem to go
slightly backwards

  the authors mistake arises from the fact that
he places himself not on the earth but outside of
it standing still in relation to space as we might
infer from the illustration of the revolving wheel
and electro-magnet am i not right

  another story that i wish to criticize while im
at it is four dimensional surgery at one
point in the story the characters are supposed to
have been pulled into the fourth dimension by
some four dimensional forceps in this dimen-
sion they are supposed to be able to put their
hands into their bodies without feeling it as though
they were not there it is then that one of the
characters snatches some gall stones within him-
self and extracts them apparently forgetting that
they are as much in the fourth dimension as him-
self and he can no more touch them than his body
and his hand would therefore pass through the
stones

  accuracy is what distinguishes jules verne and
wells from these others and i would therefore
appreciate more of these two authors works mr
hyatt verrill and garret p serviss are other fine
authors and i enjoyed the formers story into
the green prism

gustave albrecht

 north rockwell street
chicago illinois

  your criticism on the face of isis is very
clever any object propelled by centrifugal force
so called follows a tangent to the circle or curve
where the force in question was generated so a
car or object whose gravitation was nullified
would certainly fly off under the effect of centri-
fugal force at a tangent to the earth but again
if the body went through a vertical tube first we
would have a radioed component introduced so that
the curve or path traversed would be of a more or
less complex order

  as regards the four dimensional story that is
easy to criticize and most stories based on the
fourth dimension have to be treated as fantasies
for they certainly are not facts into the green
prism is certainly a fantasy also but it is dis-
tinguished by mr verrills knowledge of eth-
nology and the archeology of south america it is
a story which few will read without obtaining from
it real information-editor

thing we do not know the story is probably very
good but it does not fit in your magazine

  another thing i do not know much about inter-
planetarianism but i shall presume to ask a
question on it when the authors write stories
about interplanetary trips they forget a prime
factor that is digesting food in the space out-
side of the gravity radius of the planets i think
it should be almost impossible to eat for in-
stance when you are standing on your head you

f jss the tuned
 underground aerial

 for better reception

 with an untuned aerial
 frequently the sensitivity
 of the set is not great
 enough to give the broad-
 cast signal a predominat-
 ing strength over the ex-
 isting noise level as a
 result static predominates
 and the set is unable to
 get the desired broadcasts

  with sub-tone the aerial
  is tuned to the broadcast
  being received this al-
  lows the broadcast signal
  to have greater strength
  than the static and noise
  finer selectivity is allowed
  and reception is clearer
  and more enjoyable

heres great news for the same cost
as an ordinary overhead aerial you can
now enjoy greatly improved reception
and be through once and for all with the
old-fashioned inconvenient noise-gather-
ing roof aerial there has been such a
great demand for an improved under-
ground aerial that for over a year we
have kept engineers busy designing test-
ing and perfecting a satisfactory device

the result is the new amazing sub-
tone it is designed to decrease static
and noise get finer selectivity and give
true radio enjoyment by virtue of tim-
ing the underground aerial to the radio
circuit

its so simple a
child could install it pj

takes but a few minutes just
dig a small hole and placc the
aerial in it sub-tone is also
equipped with a scientific ground i   flhfflr
plate so that you can take care of
antenna and ground in one simple operation the lead-
in wires are brought to the set-the aerial wire connect-
ing first to a binding post on the tuner a small com-
pact device that can be placed in the radio cabinet or any
convenient place near it your aerial is out of sight and
protected from lightning soot wind and interference
you avoid many aerial troubles with the use of sub-tone

try sub-tone on your own set free

you dont need to take our word for the merits of sub-tone-we want you to
try it and prove to yourself what tests and reports from users have already
proved to us put in a sub-tone entirely at our risk just hear the differ-
ence and judge for yourself if you arent delighted with the improvement

  cannot eat not even when you are lying down
  to prove this point try it in other words i
  claim that gravity is necessary to digestion as
  there is no gravity between planets there can be
  no digestion except by special methods

   i think that the name should be changed to
 something that sounds nicer and is more sugges-
 tive amazing stories is hardly appropriate
 another thing-some people say a change of name
 would reduce circulation on the contrary the
 circulation would be increased the people who
 had been reading it before would continue to do
 so on account of profuse announcements if the
 name were good like scientifiction it would at-
 tract more readers because it is unique and because
 it is not trashy sounding

    i want to criticize your criticizer of critics i
  mean louis walder it is preposterous for a cor-
  respondent to try to criticize critics if it were
  not for the critics the magazine would lose
  interest to many the authors would not try to
  correct mistakes because they wouldnt know about
  them it is by stiff criticizing and by knowing its
  mistakes that a magaine can improve itself

    i think walter a yonovitch belongs to the class
  i have specified above he professes to have a
  great interest in the science club and yet he
  complains of the room given for discussions

    i have been reading amazing stories for some
  time but just recently i started reading dis-
  cussions now i take as great an interest in them
  as in any of the stories

    i am greatly interested in science especially
  physics i do not know much about any science
  but i have been learning and i will continue to
  learn

        nelson avenue bronx new york

   you have often noticed at the head of our
 magazine a picture of the monument to jules
 verne we have felt that he in a sense is one
 of our examples of scientific fiction authors so
 you must not object to our giving occasionally one
 of his stories we admit that we never thought
 about the digestion of food in interplanetary space
 the writer remembers many years ago seeing a
 magician standing on his hands head downwards
 on a table and taking a glass of beer in his teeth
 and swallowing the beer perhaps however he
 didnt get it down until he returned to his feet
 we are always willing that our correspondents
 give us constructive criticism-editor

a request for reprints

  editor amazing stories

     im starting my letter off with a request which
  i am sure will be seconded by a large host of
  amazing stories readers what i wish you
  would do is to reprint a merritts story through
  the dragon glass which appeared in the all-story
  magazine years ago also some stories written
  for the same magazine by austin hall ralph
  farley and homer e flint in the discussions
  column of the may issue of amazing stories
   a reader by the name of todhunter said he
  would like to know of a story called the invisible
  professor the correct name is the vanishing
  professor and its author is fred mclssac i
  read the story when it appeared and can safely
  say any scientifiction reader would enjoy it thor-
  oughly

     im for reprints but i do not mean the ones
  that were written so long ago that their forecasts
  had already come true i am also in favor of
  your reprinting the blind spot even though
  ive already read it and editor if you are
  undecided as to whether or not to print it you
  should hurry along with your decision for the
  readers of the magazine in which it originally
  appeared are voting whether they should have it
  reprinted or not by the way will your readers
  please stop casting slurs at weird tales maga-
  zine i buy every issue of argosy weird
  tales and our magazine as they appear for
  all have the same authors or most of them they
  list

     	edmond hamilton

     	david h keller

     	a merritt

     	clare w harris

     	ray cummings

     	murray leinster etc etc

     so you see when you criticise that type of
 fiction appearing in these magazines you are in
 turn throwing dirt at your own

     and editor give us another cover story con-
  test i have written many science stories amateur-
  ishly and can hardly hold myself in restraint
  when i know that some of my friends who have
  also written science stories galore chiefly among
  them john reibel author of voice from the
august 

amazing stories



 moon also of emperor of ten worlds both
 sunday times and bernard kantor author of
 invisible world and beyond this finite
 world and are also waiting for a chance to
 number as contributor of our magazine

                    jerome siegel

         kimberly avenue cleveland ohio

    we are receiving so much good and original
 matter that we have to be very chary in giving
 reprints from a literary standpoint we almost
 wish our magazine were twice as large as it is
 but of course that would be impossible now
 however with the new length of our type page
 about three pages of editorial matter is added
 we think you will like the illustrations as they
 now appear more than ever we are trying to im-
 prove amazing stories artistically as well as in
 literary and scientific value-editor

helpful ideas to be pondered
over a suggested way of
changing the name

  editor amazing stories

    your stories are good but i like all the rest of
  mankind will at present overlook all the good
  parts and give you only my criticism

    now to get down to brass tacks as the saying
  goes do you really think the english at the
  north pole comes under the heading of scienti-
  fiction does it warrant the taking up of half of
  those precious pages for which we have to wait
  a full month to make things worse only half
  of it is past the story can be found in any library
  and while it is a good story and i must say i did
  not read the book but read it in our magazine
  i still maintain it has absolutely no place under
  the heading of scientifiction

    here is another brickbat i wish the authors
  would not write some of the stories in that jerky
  fashion it looks as though theyre either pressed
  for space or else lack words what i mean is that
  the story seems to be uncompleted or else only an
  outline of the story is given i especially refer to
  the moon strollers of the may issue since it is
  the freshest in my memory

    now about pictures i read a lot about pro and
  con and have nothing to say as to whether you
  should have more of them but couldnt they be
  just a little less explanatory it often happens
  that i take a good look at a picture and can tell
  just what the story is about that takes the zest
  out of it

    now you will again hear something youve often
  heard before cant you change the title of your
  magazine i will tell you why

    i attend college during lunch time the fellows
  get together and often discuss things that would
  make a good basis for your authors once i hap-
  pened to mention amazing stories and all the
  fellows at once suggested ghost stories love stories
  etc for me they while i know all of them
  would enjoy amazing stories never looked into
  one as though it was just another of the trashy
  category

    now my argument is this if you would put
  into say six issues a large noticeable announce-
  ment that you will change the name you positively
  will not lose any of your steady readers now let
  us say it will cost you something to effect this
  change i feel certain that the increased number
  of readers those that are interested in science will
  in a very short time reimburse your possible loss
  you certainly cannot lose any old readers by
  changing the name again i repeat that many
  people who would be overjoyed to read your maga-
  zine dont do it because they do not recognize its
  value i myself came upon it accidentally and
  many to whom i recommended it are thankful to
  me

    the old experimenter suddenly disappeared
  and we had a deuce of a job finding out what
  became of it it should have been advertised as i
  suggested

    but please think twice before you give us an-
  other jules verne story let us have long inter-
  planetary stories with good science especially some
  of that brand new science the authors invent so
  when i get up against some fellow reader who uses
  your magazine as a textbook we can have a red
  hot debate

    science teaches us that things expand in heat
  well summer is just around the corner and i
  suppose you are about outlining your summer
  issues couldnt you follow science and expand
  your magazine make it a little longer not the
  size of your paper of course but the stories and
  their number

    you advertised that the quarterly will be out
  april th well it is the th now and still i
  dont see it what is the matter i hope your

  course of your life and attract success
  health happiness and a development of
  mental foresight that will astound you
  and surprise your friends

  the rosicrucians were the master mys-
  tics in all ages and today they are or-
  ganized in lodges groups and colleges
  in all parts of the world in their teach-
  ings they secretly preserve the ancient
  wisdom that made the pyramid in egypt

  temples of greece the most alluring
  places of strange achievements

  you may share in this great knowledge
  if you are more than a mere seeker for
  mystery and magic if you really desire
  to master the arcane occult knowledge
  of the masters step by step and become
  a true adept of the rosicrucian frater-
  nity you may have the doorway opened
  to you

  the rosicrucian teachings containing
  the true knowledge of the mystics are
  never published in books but you may
  borrow a book called the light of
  egyptin which the strange story of
  the rosicrucians is told and an explana-
  tion of how you may have the private
  teachings of the rosicrucian fraternity
  in america

 unless you are truly sincere and
 anxious to study and gradually become
 developed in a superior manner do not

   the english at the north pole like the
journey to the center of the earth which we
published some years ago is full of science
meteorological and otherwise you rather weaken
your argument about it by letting us know that
you read it for the first time in what you so aptly
call our magazine every author of course has
his style and while we take the liberty of very
carefully editing the stories we cannot make any
radical changes

   our effort in the matter of the pictures is to
get them accurate if there is a test-tube rack in
one of them or a bunsen burner we like to show
it as it really exists but this does not tell the
story the trouble about changing our name is
just this the magazine is now very widely known
under that name it has a large and appreciative
circle of readers so that you can see that any
change in the name is a very delicate matter

   an interplanetary story from the very nature of
things must have more fantasy in it than anything
else we think it is possible that it might be really
cold in interplanetary space where there is no air
the distance of the different planets their size
their characteristics as far as known-these and
other things take care of the basic science element
in these popular and imaginative productions

   as the prizewinners of  i have selected
the war of the worlds by h g wells and
the land that time forgot by edgar r
burroughs for  the moon men by frank
brueckel jr and armageddon- by
philip nowlan takes first place for 

  and now for the brickbats-in the face of
isis by cyril g wates the author states that
the action of a base on an unknown element com-
bined with magnesium makes it a non-conductor of
gravitation i believe this to be impossible be-
cause the aforesaid force acts through the ether
and any chemist would think you crazy if you
told him that the action of an acid on a compound
could decrease its mass by making it denser
and thus increase the speed of its electronsr

   while i have not as yet made a special study
of worms as classed under metazoans i do not
believe that they have eyes or are equipped for
boring through rock that would blunt a diamond
drill as dr david h keller states in the
worm also how can a shadow be a perfect two-
dimensional object it is merely an image in the
brain caused by the reflection of light rays a
two-dimensional object could not exist since every
particle of matter in the universe has three
dimensions

   and now i have at least one bouquet for you if
you do not regard my second paragraph as con-
taining such mistakes are becoming fewer and
fewer and your stories are a distinct improvement
over those first published

   your letter is very interesting we have en-
joyed its comments

  you must not be too positive about how the
force of gravitation acts you say it acts through
the ether but the ether is a hypothetical body and
magnetic induction and gravitation are profound
mysteries and bid fair to remain so for a long
time

   dr kellers story the worm has an atmos-
phere about it which gives it true value and the
atmosphere certainly was conduced to greatly by
his attributing such power to the worm

   as regards the shadow problem you say every
particle of matter in the universe has three di-
mensions but the shadow has only two so we
think it is really an admirable though somewhat
metaphorical presentation of the two-dimensional
object the last sentence of your letter tells us
that our magazine is improving this is a most
welcome tribute-editor

a critic of mr verrill

  editor amazing stories

    allow me for the first time to contribute to the
  discussions column

    each issue brings new thrills and added scien-
  tific knowledge to me i read the april number
  yesterday in one sitting  the revolt of the
  atoms was superb an excellent lesson in chem-
  istry the motto of amazing stories ought to
  be learn while you are entertained

    while reading into the green prism i dis-
  covered several inconsistencies which i call to
  your attention

    	the author says the microscopic manabis are
  about the size of an atom then he says the grains
  of sand would appear as mountains to them if a
  grain of sand were magnified to the size of our
  moon the atoms of sioa might then be visible

    	another statement makes the molecules of
  water appear as great clouds to the tiny manabis
  then the professors see the manabi village wet
  from the rain can the author explain how a
  molecule of h can be split up so that a fine
  spray of water would result  this is incredible

    	let us again take the authors statement that
  the manabi village could be situated between two
  grains of sand as between great cliffs would not
  the tread of a full-sized mans foot displace several
  grains of sand at the least and thus bring destruc-
  tion to the tiny inhabitants

    	once more mr verrill says that each mole-
  cule of water would appear as a dark large
  cloud now if a molecule at that height would
  be of such great size the atoms and the electrons
  composing it would be visible the electrons
  would be the size of tennis balls revolving hundreds
  of feet from the nucleus would the rays of light
  be too dense to enter between these i agree with
  one reader who writes that out of the sub-uni-
  verse was the best story youve ever published
  it certainly was grand dr menzels articles on
  einsteins theories in science and invention
  are most vivid and have given me more enlighten-
  ment on the subject than any book i have ever
  read on it

    i disagree with readers who want the name or
  type of cover changed both the name and cover
  are well established and it would be poor policy
  to change them

   buried treasure was amusing the crypto-
 gram is clever and reminded me of poes the
 gold bug

    long life to scientifiction the worlds most
  popular boon to the advance of science 
  leon rosenthal

         liberty st w h newburgh n y

    we have already spoken of mr verrills story
  into the green prism and have observed that he
  has attained almost classic writing as he has pro-
  duced what is really a beautiful story with much
  of the poetic side of human nature in it he is a
  very popular writer and perhaps the fact that he
  always takes liberties in his stories must be justi-
  fied for the need he feels of keeping the readers
  interest alive he is a distinguished scientist
  himself and you will find his ethnology and his
  descriptions of archeology of the spanish ameri-
  cas most interesting as regards atoms and mole-
  cules you will find that scientists are still far
  from certain as to their constitution-editor

from a young reader

  editor amazing stories

   after sitting and listening to your readers talk
  all evening i find myself obliged to put in my oar
  i have just finished your may number the
  story i liked best was the moon strollers it
  is i think very practical and is in accordance with
  a principal point of interest of the present age
  that of reaching the moon

   next i would like to take up the age-old argu-
  ment your cover i just read mrs snyders
  epistle and my case is the same i was also at-
  tracted to the magazine by its cover

   i am a young reader being only fourteen i do
  not get every number as my father considers
  amazing stories sensational trash which it
  most certainly is not

                    theodore e green

              p  box  vista california
  we receive many letters from young readers
  most of them are decidedly commendatory as
  regards your father do you not think you could
  get him to read some of our stories so that he
  will change his mind about the status of amazing
  stories we take such a personal interest in it
  that we are anxious to have everybody like it
  the letters we publish in our correspondence
  column and there are many more which we have
  no room for are absolutely not picked out because
  they praise us rather we are guided by their
  interest and solid value-editor

a reader looks for cold facts in
amazing stories

  editor amazing stories

    i have been reading amazing stories for the
  past year and i find its contents as good as any
  stories i have ever read there are some stories
  i do not like but the majority of them are ex-
  cellent such stories as the world of the giant
  ants for instance do not appeal to me i
  thought amazing stories was based on facts if
  they are then why print such stories as these
  i also like good interplanetary stories but i think
  when too many are published in one edition it
  tends to destroy the interest one has in the
  magazine

    in one story an author tells us that in travel-
  ing through space a person in a space-flyer has
  no weight to speak of in another story the
  author tells us that a person in a space-flyer can
  walk around as though he or she were on the
  earth now which is truthful

    i believe that after passing out of the atmosphere
  of the earth a body has no weight whatsoever
  if that is true how is it possible to attain any
  speed desired it is so that the less weight the
  more speed but with less safety

    another thing if all the instruments that have
  been produced in the last ten years are as they
  have been claimed to be why has there not been
  started a projectile such as explained in four
  dimensional transit

    i read the story of the master of the world
  in it it explained how an airplane could be turned
  into a speedboat a submarine or into an auto at
  will if that is true which i think it is why has
  it not been done

    your appreciation of our work is most accept-
  able sometimes we feel as if it has taken all
  these years to give us a complete feel of the
  public taste in such material as we use and we
  believe that the result will be to give a better
  magazine always amazing stories may be said
  to be based on facts largely but its stories are
  based on other things also they are based on
  possibilities of the future and in order to give the
  romantic touch our authors indulge in what may
  be called quite wild predictions of what is to come
  your views about weight are inaccurate the
  atmosphere of the earth has no connection with
  weight except as it acts to buoy up the body and
  if the body is that of a human being the buoyant
  effect is very little in case of a mass of lead it
  would be still less proportionately weight is due
  to the gravitational attraction of the earth for the
  object and of the object for the earth a space
  traveler would ultimately reach a zone of no
  weight or of practically none there is no rela-
  tion between weight and speed if the body con-
  tinues to be propelled a very heavy projectile
  other things being equal will go further than a
  light one because proportionately there is less air
  resistance if you do not understand the points
  we are making do not hesitate to write again
  various efforts have been made in the direction
  of constructing an automobile which would cross a
  river acting as a boat but we never heard of
  anybody attempting to give it the third function of
  being a submarine so do not look for cold facts
  only in amazing stories look for inspiration
  and possibilities of future times and realize that
  the wildest predictions in many cases may be true
  views of the future-editor

  editor amazing stories

    i have just finished reading the discussions
  department and was rather amused at the many
  varied ideas for bettering our magazine

    it has been my thought if you were to try and
  please every one why not take inventory of the
  likes and dislikes of each individual and make a
  magazine for that person alone now as that is
  quite impossible why must there be so much
  squawking do not our readers realize they are
  getting some of the best stories from some of the
  best if not the best authors of their type in the
  country

   and now as i am a loyal booster of amazing
 stories and that name stands for me ive been
 telling my friends about the educational faculties
 in scientific lines which are in the magazine in
 hopes of getting more loyal boosters for us i
 have succeeded very well to a certain degree but
 then ive been laughed at by others especially
 when i outlined the story of a modern atlantis
 the fellow i am living with is taking up aviation
 and naturally knowing something about it said it
 wasnt practical at all and so i receive the merry

  haha but as the saying goes he who laughs last
  laughs best it is an old saying and a true one
  for there is now indisputable proof of the prac-
  ticability of that idea

    i will try and explain to those who may still
  doubt the far-seeing and correct-seeing eyes in
  some of the authors stories in our magazine

    at wilmington delaware there is now under
  construction a seaport patterned after the descrip-
  tion given in that story it is to be completed in
  six months after a trial of six months between
  the united states and bermuda if proven success-
  ful six more are to be built and stationed across
  the atlantic a company has already been formed
  with capital and funds to complete all of these
  floating airports if the first proves its worth
  and the other six are completed it will cut trans-
  oceanic travel from five and six days to  or 
  hours so i hope some of your skeptical friends
  will read this and verify my statements

    in closing may i just state that all the stories
  published so far have been very good and some
  cannot be praised enough as for the reprints
  put em in and i hope you get so many calls for
  more editions that you have to start a weekly
  besides the monthly quarterly and annual

    i am glad to see at least one old veteran taking
  an interest in something really worth while i
  refer to our blind friend who lost his sight in the
  big fight i was there but was only nicked

a friend and booster
no name

no address

    we thank you for your kind letter it is quite
  interesting to find you noted the construction of
  the floating sea-port at wilmington its progress
  will be followed in the columns of science and
  invention

   the waves of the ocean affect the water to
 a- very limited depth the motion of a deep
 draught ship in a seaway is far different from
 that of a shallow vessel the floating sea-port

a good criticism and apprecia-

a baseball player

  editor amazing stories

    in the discussions department of your maga-
  zine i have read letters from people of every walk
  of life but never have i read one written by a
  baseball player-so here goes

    i have been a reader of amazing stories ever
  since the first issue was printed and i find i have
  nothing but praise for the magazine i stay far
  away from home most of the year and amazing
  stories helps wonderfully to pass the lonely nights
  away i am especially pleased with your magazine
  cover your artist does himself proud on every
  cover produced and circulated the cover helps
  to distinguish your magazine from all others on
  the book-stand and if the pictures are extraordi-
  nary in looks they only harmonize with the con-
  tents of the magazine-so thats that i also read
  letters in discussions criticizing certain stories
  as being scientifically incorrect-that is not good
  most of the criticizers have no absolute proof that
  they are right in their opinions and as i under-
  stand it the object of amazing stories is to
  stimulate the imagination i see no use in this
  criticism that the magazine receives through
  discussions i have corresponded with numerous
  people all over the globe and i enjoy that very
  much all in all i think that amazing stories
  couldnt be improved on for good solid reading

 possibility of improving amazing stories but
 what we have in mind is to improve it materially
 during the next year if we can do so we would
 have it continue to be your friend to whom you

  we have had stories about mars and we hope
that mr ullrich will accede to your wishes and
give us a good story as a sequel to the moon
strollers but we are afraid that the limitations
of size in our magazine and the great quantity of
stories which are brought to our desk will make
the giving of sequels rather a problem it is not
known whether there are inhabitants on mars
there is a feeling that it involves great waste if
there are no inhabitants on the planets but the
sun is so great a waster that it casts all other in-
efficiencies into the shade only an infinitesimal
part of its heat and light are picked up by the
planets-editor

a correspondents little say

editor amazing stories

well since i have read eveiy mag you have
printed since the first i figure i have a perfect
right to my little say where i get a lot of my kick
is in the discussions i have before me now a
fellow that is broadminded and then he goes on to
tell about a certain story that is a lot of bologny
it wasnt long ago that all the smart boys said
after a fellow fell so far he was dead before he
hit the ground but that has been proven false
and a good many of the inventions to-day are
made contrary to all the smart boys beliefs

as for the cover

it was the cover that attracted my attention for
the very first publication and that is really all
your cover is good for-i mean to attract new
readers because the old readers only look for
the name

we know whats inside of the cover

sy neigbors
co irene johnson eureka california

we were very glad to get your little say
you are right we should be very slow in pro-
nouncing a thing to be impossible it is safe to
say every great discovery of the last  years has
met many critics some who scientifically demon-
strated its impossibility who called it absurd until
it was proved beyond doubt and what you say
about the name it seems to us is quite true it
is perfectly clear that if we change the name
many of our old readers would feel as though they
were lost on the other hand the covers must
attract new readers-that is its function the
discussions columns certainly do interest us
and whatever the writers may say whether good
or bad the exhibition of their interest is very
flattering-editor

a breezy letter of hidden
appreciation

editor amazing stories

   knowing that your magazine amazing stories
is a comparatively new one allowances must be
made for its quality it certainly does not com-
pare favorably with the best fiction magazines in
regard to quality of paper print cover designs
illustrations etc but it is improving perceptibly
and no doubt will continue to do so in the future

   i would send mr frank brueckel jr a text-
book on trigonometry or higher math if i knew
the date of his birthday i am sure it would
please him far more than the moon pool

   such stories as the moon pool are a serious
menace to the mental equilibrium of the great
minds of our noble country

   something should be done about it-for instance
give us more of them there are a few readers
like me who will martyr themselves by taking a
chance on them and then start yelling for more

   well anyway i like discussions and youll
get plenty of knocks in your engine if you cut
down on the space devoted thereto

   this is our mag and if it werent for us
readers there wouldnt be any amazing stories
so its up to you to let us air our pet grievances
etc and also give vent to our irrepressible enthu-
siasm via discussions

   the stories are fine and i liked the june issue

we consider the present well named the machine
age but it is easy to see now that we are a long
ways from the limits and perfection of mechanical and
scientific inventions even those who have recently
arrived at the adult age can remember the time when an
automobile was not only a rarity but an awe-inspiring
sight and a matter for much wagging of skeptical heads
yet already the airplane bids fair to being the common
mode of long distance transportation within the next few
years new machines are constantly being invented to

eliminate more and more labor where will all these new
inventions-which can almost be predicted with certainty
-lead the great masses who depend on their muscle for
their livelihood

  in this story harl vincent himself a scientific man
intimately connected with the world of electrical and
mechanical inventions suggests many possibilities in
bartons island he brings us much beyond the seventh
generation though he does it in his own realistic
manner with plenty of scientific detail

resident ross haven for the past
seven years the nominal chief executive of
united north america apprehensively re-
garded the heavy jowled red-faced in-
dividual who sat across the desk from him
in his private chambers in the new executive mansion
high above the crystal roof-tops of the great city of
washington with a sinking of the heart he recalled
that he was completely in the power of this unscrupu-
lous master of men who had reached the position of
virtual dictator in the world-feared republic that was
formed after the disastrous eurasian war of -
 entering that frightful holocaust late in 
the united states of america had emerged victorious
and with most of the worlds wealth in her possession
including title to the dominion of canada now in
 with europe asia and africa not yet recovered
from the terrible ravages of the great war united
north america with a population of more than a half
billion dominated the world with a ruthless and iron-
gloved hand and jerome carter the presidents visi-
tor dictated its policies

  i cant do it carter stubbornly stated the presi-
dent

  carter leaned his huge bulk forward in his chair tap-
ping the glass-topped desk with a pudgy forefinger
the presidents slight form seemed to wither beneath
the baleful glare that came from the deep-set piggish
eyes of his caller his care-worn face sagged and its
lines deepened into the furrows of approaching old age

  oh but you can do it said carter with a mean-
ing grimace otherwise its-assassination

  you wouldnt dare whispered haven

  wouldnt i  who do you suppose was responsible
for the passing of the recalcitrant selwin former sec-
retary of labor

  haven started you didnt- he faltered

  i did chuckled carter gloatingly and youll not
use it to my harm either apoplexy the physicians
called it but my chemists know how apoplexy can be
brought on quite simply and surely

  you-you-beast stammered the president

  i forgive you the insult mr president sneered
carter with mock deference but are you ready to
listen to reason now

  haven became propitiatory perhaps after all

you are right he offered you have not given me
your reasons in full you know

  that is better and i know this has come to you
as a shock philip barton being your own son-in-law
it is entirely due to that relation that he has not already
been-removed-as was selwin i have a deep affec-
tion for you mr president and for your sweet daugh-
ter who was so unfortunate as to have married this
barton but barton is dangerous and must be removed
from our fair country in deference to your feelings
i am proposing that he be merely exiled and in all
fairness i am willing that his wife and certain of his
boon companions accompany him i swear that no
violence will come to any of the party but he must be
exiled

  with this hypocritical speech carter thrust a paper
into the presidents hand sign he commanded

	 

two hours later the public and private news-speak-
ers throughout all north america repeated the
astounding information that the president had decreed
banishment for his own daughter and her husband it
was during the mid-day rest period for the workers
and in the lower levels of the great cities thousands
of gray-clad toilers slipped from the moving ways to
gather in the squares where the huge instruments of
the newscasting corporation blared forth the an-
nouncements from washington pasty-faced laborers
who had not seen the light of day in many months
gazed understanding and hopelessly at each other as
the significance of the governmental proclamation be-
came evident for philip barton was the friend of the
subservient multitude in gray

  in new york the great center of population which
spread its crystal roofs a full fifty miles along the
hudson river and housed more than sixty million
souls a little group gathered in secret behind one of
the great pillars that extend from the third sub-level
to the fortieth upper level of the city in cooper square
a small group it was indeed-not more than twenty
men and girls-but they were staunch and loyal sup-
porters of that figure now most in the public eye philip
barton they had eluded the watchful eye of the law
personified by the red-clad police who were well paid
and luxuriously housed by the plutocracy

i he great universities of chicago and new
york were in constant conflict each was
determined to be known as the greatest
american seat of learning for years the
rich men of each metropolis had competed
with each other in the endowments that they gave to
their favorite university famous educators from all
parts of the world had been induced by magnificent
salaries to come to one or the other of the two univer-
sities in fact the cream of modern intelligence was
centered around these two schools had the two fac-
ulties suddenly died it would have been an absolute
impossibility to replace them by other such teachers

  and not only educators were lecturing at these col-
leges men of renown in every walk of life were giv-
ing courses in their specialties and these special courses
were considered as a very great factor towards the nec-

acted to similar stimuli this opens vistas of possibilities
for what might not be possible when this apparatus is per-
fected and progressive experiments have been made in this
story by dr keller who is not only a physician but has a
record of thirteen years of psychiatric practice behind him
also we are allowed an absorbing glimpse into a vision of
possible future achievements we have often wondered how
the individuals accumulated knowledge might be used

 essary culture of the young students novelists actors
 poets economists politicians explorers all were ea-
 gerly sought the two schools bidding against each other
 for the right to claim them as members of their respec-
 tive faculties

   the tremendous funds available at each city made
 possible contracts with these men lasting throughout
 their lifetime their intellectual efforts were literally
 sold completely and permanently till the day of their
 death and even after their death their salaries were to
 continue as long as any dependents survived them for
 many years this effort of each city university to secure
 only the very best intellects in the world continued it
 came to an end only when every noted educator scien-
 tist or expert in literature had a permanent contract
 with the one school or the other the conflict ceased
 for a while because of lack of material to fight over

the

kternal professors

  by david h keller md

  when the lull came it is only the truth to say look-
ing at the schools from an unbiased viewpoint that the
two faculties were rather evenly matched each had
over two hundred supermen who daily lectured to large
classes of enthusiastic students each city claimed its
college as the greatest in the world and the rivalry
might have been beneficial and mutually inspiring had
it not been for an unfortunate enthusiasm on the part
of some of the new yorkers which resulted in the seri-
ous injury and final death of several of the most bril-
liant of the chicago professors

  the friendly contest at once degenerated into a bitter
internecine warfare the university of new york
expressed its regret at the unfortunate happening but
the chicago university scorned the apologies all re-
lations between the two schools ceased and the contest
to secure the highest enrollment was more determined
than ever it was now not a question of lowering the
tuition rate but of actually subsidizing students to leave
one city and seek their education at the other

  this condition lasted for a year the feeling was
tense but it was hoped by the cooler minds that ulti-
mately the bitterness would disappear then like the
sudden dawn in the tropics a catastrophe struck the
new york faculty for a while the cause was as mys-
terious as it was damaging to the future hopes of the
eastern university within a few weeks practically
every member of the teaching force of the new york
university developed the preliminary symptoms of ma-
lignant cancer so uniform was this occurrence so
simultaneous was it in its development that only one
conclusion could be reached by the medical men of new
york who were in charge of the secret investigation
they were sure that in some way the entire faculty
had been inoculated with the deadly germs then one
of the doctors remembered that a month before practi-
cally every member of the faculty had been present at
a banquet given in honor of the president of the uni-
versity it must have been that the unsuspecting diners
had been fed some unknown germ then

  it was truly an unknown type of cancer cell and the
resulting disease was also absolutely new to medical
science the trouble started in the feet and while it
did not at once disable the victim there was every indi-
cation that it would prove fatal within a few months

  though it seemed to resemble in some details the
giant celled sarcoma it had certain characteristics that
were different certain peculiarities that made it par-
ticularly hopeless to the new york scientists it was

a threatening danger that spelled doom to the future
hopes of the wonderful university unless something
could be done unless this deadly danger was success-
fully fought by every form of ultra-scientific medicine
and surgery then not only would these two hundred
men die but with them would die the greatness of tne
metropolitan seat of learning this faculty could not
be replaced and chicago would at once leap to the fore
as the most important seat of learning in the world
the work of patient years would be set at naught the
efforts of a generation would be obliterated in a few
months

  the professors told of their fate and faced the inevi-
table with the calmness that might be expected of phi-
losophers and scientists feeling confident that they
had no souls they viewed with disdain the certain dis-
solution of the bodies which housed the nerve cells
which when functioning enabled them to think they
felt that if the most celebrated surgeons and physicians
in new york said that they were doomed it was useless
for them to worry their dependents were provided
for their memory was certain to be preserved in the
sacred archives of the college library they having
made education a vital force in new york now needed
no other monument in a few weeks the summer vaca-
tion would begin and they all felt that they would be
able to finish their lectures during the summer vaca-
tion they could dictate their memoirs and prepare to die
like gentlemen the only thing they had to worry about
was the fact that they were not sure as to what they
were dying of or what part if any the university of
chicago played in the tragic happening

  a mantle of silence was spread over the entire mat-
ter no man who could not be trusted was allowed to
partake of the secret the faculty had decided that
they would die without giving chicago the satisfaction
of knowing that they were dying

coincident with this tragedy a remarkable visi-
tor came to america he was none other than
professor chenenko of leningrad for many years
this biologist and vivisectionist had been working in his
laboratory allowing the world to remain in ignorance
of his efforts his obscurity was not a deliberate con-
cealment on his part but was simply due to the fact that
he had been so intensely interested in his lifework
now he had reached the point at which it was not only
necessary for him to have more help he also needed
far greater financial assistance than he possibly could

ever since einstein started the talk about the fourth
dimension and relativity there has been little abate-
ment of interest in the subject for most of us however
this matter is hardly cleared up by much reading on the
subject on the contrary it seems that each time a point
is definitely cleared up the next tome on the subject com-
pletely disproves your conclusions

  but in the words of the scientist who is the hero of this

have known the late dr thorndyke for
over twenty years and have found him to
be an unusually truthful man not at all
given to exaggeration or misrepresentation
it is true that for a time after the great
bennett university earthquake and fire disaster in
which he almost lost his life he was considered mentally
unbalanced from the effects of a blow on the head but
everyone agrees that he fully recovered and ceased to
be troubled by his so-called hallucinations

  knowing the man as i did i cant doubt the truth of
the marvelous story which he had typewritten and at-
tached to his last will and testament i myself have
seen the two-dimensional guinea pig and the strangely
distorted bust of shakespeare -also i can attest to
the fact that the brown eye and the green eye of gyp
changed positions about the time of the earthquake
without further explanation i will let you have the
story just as dr thorndyke wrote it himself so that
you can be your own judge of its probability

thorndykes story

to whomever it may concern being the only
living man who witnessed the demonstrations of
the so-called dimension segregator unless phil
and theda make their return to the three-dimensional
existence i consider it my duty to leave to posterity
all my knowledge of the said machine and a description
of the experiments performed with it in my presence

  after repeatedly having tried to convince the world
of the actual existence of the machine and its wonderful
performances only to be judged insane i decided to re-
frain from discussing the matter further i worked in
secret in the attempt to discover the nature of the
wonderful segregating ray but without success

now realizing that my remaining years on earth are

story- we should learn something first of the two-dimen-
sional world if we expect to learn anything of the fourth-
dimensional world it seems to us there is much wis-
dom in that thought our new author apparently agrees
with his hero and proceeds to listen attentively to his ex-
planations and watch his demonstrations all of which is
done in layman style

 we suggest you join the author and us

but few i am having this manuscript prepared to leave
to posterity so that if the ray is rediscovered after my
death the credit may go where it belongs-to philip
tulane also that the rediscoverers may use what knowl-
edge i have in their experiments i am writing from
memory but though it has been twenty years since
the occurrence of the wonderful phenomena described
herein they have been continually in my thoughts and
i have not omitted a single detail of importance

i was an instructor in the school of electrical
engineering at bennett university at bennettsville
california and philip tulane was an instructor in
higher mathematics i was ten years older than he but
we grew to be warm friends our friendship was not
the kind based on social equality or anything like that
neither of us had time or inclination to mingle in the
social life of the campus we both spent most of our
spare time in dabbling in the sciences outside our regu-
lar lines my amateur experiments in biology and as-
tronomy never produced any results unless it was a
lessened efficiency as an electrical engineer but with
phil it was different his hobbies were chemistry and
physics and he made several notable discoveries in
these sciences

  among his discoveries was the strange substance
which i named tulanium in his honor i dont know
whether this substance was like that which has been
called nutronium or not i do know that it was pro-
duced by reducing iron to absolute zero by means of
complicated compression refrigeration this tulanium
was infinitely hard dense and very heavy he ex-
plained to me that at the temperature of absolute zero
all molecular vibration ceased he even claimed that
the spaces between the atoms and molecules were closed
up so that it was an absolute solid i dont know about
that but i do know that it was not affected by heat and

much is being written now about glands the action
of the endocrine secretions has a definite effect on
the human system it is almost appalling when we con-
sider the vast harm a gland which is not functioning prop-

erly can have on the well-being and health of an individual

the story of the endocrine gland is aptly woven into a
scientific detective story of definite merit we know you
will enjoy reading the story as much as we have

an unexpected development

cranes earliest recollection was
having to take his medicine liter-
eaking every morning his nurse
give him an orange-colored trans-
capsule he was warned not to
chew it like candy but to swallow it right down with
the drink of water which she had ready for him this
recollection dated back to a period when he was be-
tween three and four years old

  the first nurse he remembered had worn puff sleeves
some years later at the age of eight austin had come
across a fashion plate in an old magazine all the
figures wore puff sleeves he had wondered mildly
to whom these ladies fed orange-colored capsules before
breakfast

  being an inquisitive child he had also wondered
about certain other things why for instance was he
not permitted to go to school with other children
the big handsome schoolhouse with its doric columns
had always fascinated him when he rode past it with
his tutor and culp the liveried chauffeur slowed up the
car at the school crossing austin would peer through
the glass at the words knowledge is power which
were chiseled in gold letters above the door as he
watched the army of shouting children at play an
almost uncontrollable impulse to fling the door of the
car open and to run out and join the shouting mob
would sweep over him he wanted to yell with them
to be yelled at by them and above all he wanted to be
let in on his share of the power which was advertised
in the golden letters above the door

  at such moments he vaguely felt that somehow or
other life had cheated him that there was something
lacking in his existence which neither culp the chauf-
feur sims the butler mr henry the tutor or his
mother could supply he also felt that a sort of con-
spiracy to cheat him of something he hardly knew
what was going on between these people and old doctor
goldwin who came down on the first of every month
and looked over and left a fresh supply of orange-
colored capsules with his mother

  it was on one of these monthly visits when austin
was eighteen years old that he overheard a discussion
of himself between her and the doctor he had not
meant to be eavesdropping he was coming down the
soft-carpeted stairway when he heard the voices of his
mother and the physician in the living room doctor
goldwin said

  the boy is entering young manhood with every nor-
mal manifestation you need not worry he is a
perfect specimen of manhood his physical and mental
status is decidedly above par

  austin heard his mother reply

  but suppose he wishes to marry some day-and the
day must inevitably come

  i see no reason why he shouldnt the doctor had
replied

  austin tiptoed back upstairs to his room he pon-
dered deeply upon what he had overheard he won-
dered what they had meant if there was anything
wrong with him he wanted to know it he decided
to speak to his mother about it that night after doctor
goldwin had gone but abandoned the idea when he
remembered that in doing so he would indict himself
for eavesdropping the physicians words hes a
perfect specimen of manhood kept ringing  in his
ears what did doctor goldwin mean and why
shouldnt he be a perfect specimen

  he crossed to the window and stood looking out
into the long island sound in the cove at the foot
of the garden his sloop lay moored his mother had
bought it for him two years before and on fine days
he and mr henley cruised about the sound in it
beyond the wide sun-hot expanse of the sound the
low cliffs of the connecticut shore lay traced faintly
in the late afternoon mist he wondered what manner
of people lived there he felt suddenly a strong desire
to go and see-to bolt from the odious restraint of his
daily routine of lessons exercises and walks and to
escape the spying eyes of sims culp mr henley and
his mother

  turning he walked to the cheval mirror at the end of
the room he looked himself over critically he could
judge himself only by comparison with the few people
with whom he came in daily contact he knew that he
was taller than mr henley the tutor almost as tall as
culp the chauffeur and that he carried himself nearly
as straight as sims the butler certainly with more ease
he knew that his blue eyes were much clearer than
culps and that his light hair was of much finer quality
he wondered if these were signs of perfect manhood
he had always rather admired the chauffeurs wiry hair
and the way culp wore his cap pulled forward over
his shaggy eyebrows

he had thought about this episode for weeks he
was burning to know about himself but he knew

ustin
that of
ally sp
would
inheritance

 he raised his head with an angry snarl but the snarl turned to amazement when he found himself looking
 into the bore of an automatic pistol which to his bulging eyes looked like the end of a section of a drain pipe
