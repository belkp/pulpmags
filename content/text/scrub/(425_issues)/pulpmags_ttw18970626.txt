  toots the colored boy who had
spoken first began to sway in his saddle
and frank merriwell spurted to his side
grasping him by the arm as he sharply
said 

  brace up you mustnt give out

 	lawd save us hoarsely gasped the

  you are to blame for this merri-
well came reproachfully from diamond-
you were the one who suggested that
we should attempt to cross the grea
american desert we could have gone

round to the north and-

  say diamond cried harry rattle-
ton  riv us a guest-i mean give us a
rest you were as eager as any of us to
try to cross the desert for you thought
wed have it to boast about when we re-
turned to yale 

  but well never return
	frank merriweli

  perliaps not still i dont like to hear
yon piling all the blame onto merry
he suggested it

  and you seconded the suggestion
we started out with a supply of water that

we thought would last-

  we should have known better
perhaps so but that is the fault of
all of us not any one person you are
getting to be a regular kicker of late
jack shot harry a savage look

  be careful he said i dont feel
like standing too much i am rather
ugly just now

  thats right and you have been the
only one who has shown anything like
ugliness at any time during the trip you
seem to want to put the blame of any
mistake onto merry while it is all of

  say drop it commanded frank
sharply this is no time to quarrel
those mountains are close at hand i am
sure and a last grim pull will take us to
them we will find water there for you
know we were told about the water holes
in the desert range

  those water holes will not be easy to
find

  i have full directions for finding
them after we get a square drink well
feel better and therell be  inclination
to quarrel 

  oh water water murmured brown-
ing how id like to let about a quart
gurgle down past my adams apple
urn um muttered rattleton lift-
ing one hand to his throat why do
you suppose a fellows larynx is called his
adams apple

  nothing could be more appropriate
declared bruce soberly for when adam
ate the apple he got it in the neck 
something like a cackling laugh came
from harrys parched lips

  diamond gave an exclamation of dis-
gust

 on the deselit

  this is a nice time to joke he
grated fiercely

  the matter with you said rattle-
ton is that youve not got over think-
ing of lona aer the mormons daugh-
ter whom you were mashed  youve
been grouchy ever since you and merry
came back from your wild expedition in-
to the forbidden valley of bethsada its

too bad jack-

  shut up will you  ive heard enough
about that

  drop it harry commanded frank
warningly youve worn it out for-
get it 

  great scott grunted browning i
believe my bicycle is heavier than the
dealer represented it to be

  think so asked rattleton

  sure

  then give it a weigh

  brownings wheel gave a sudden wob-
ble that nearly threw him off

  dont he gasped its not origi-
nal you swiped it from the very same
paper that had my adams apple joke in
it

  well it was simply a case of retalia-
tion 

  id rather have a case of beer oh
say-a case of beer i wouldnt do a
thing to a case of beer-not a thing
oh just to think of sitting in the old
room at traegers or moreys and drink-
ing all the beer or ale a fellow could pour
down his neck  it makes me faint
you should not permit yourself to
think of such a thing as beer said
frank jokingly you know beer will
make you fat 

  dont care id drink it if it made
me so fat i couldnt walk id train
down you know dumb bells punching
bag and so forth

  speaking of the punching bag said
frank makes me tnink of a good tiling
on reggy stevens you know stevens
hes near-sighted goes in for athletics
frank mekriwell on the desert	

and takes great deliglit in the fancy man-
ner in which he can hammer the bag
well he went down into the country to
see his cousin last spring sometime dur-
ing the winter his cousin had found a big
hornets nest in the woods and had cut it
down and taken it home he hung it up
in the garret first day stevens was
there he wandered up into the garret and
saw the hornets nest hanging in the dim
light ho said reggy didnt know
cousin had a punching bag glad i
found it ill toy with it a little then
he threw off his coat and made a rush at
that innocent-looking ball with his
first blow he drove his fist clean through
the nest holy smoke gasped reggy
what have i struck then the hornets
came pouring out for the nest was not a
deserted one they saw reggy-and
went him several better say fellows
they didnt do a thing to poor reggy
about five hundred made for him and it
seemed to reggy that at least four hun-
dred and ninety-nine of them got him
his howls started shingles off the roof of
that old house and knocked several
bricks out of the chimney he fell down
tlie stairs and went plunging through
the house with a string of hornets trail-
ing after him like a comets tail the
hornets did not confine themselves strictly
to reggy some of them sifted off and
got in their work on reggys cousin
aunt uncie the kitchen girl the hired
man and one of them made for the dog
the dog thought that hornet was a fly
and snapped at it one second later that
dog joined in the general riot and the
way he swore and yelled fire in dog lan-
guage was something frightful to hear
reggy didnt stop till he got outside and
plunged his head into the old-fashioned
watering trough where he held it under
the sirface till he was nearly drowned
the whole family was a sight and
reggy-well hes had the swelled head
ever since 

  rattleton laughed and bruce managed
to smile while toots gave a cracked
yah yah but diamond failed to show
that he appreciated the story in the least

  however it soon became evident that
the spirits of the lads had been lightened
somewhat and they pedaled onward
straight for the grim mountains which
had seemed so near for the last two hours

  the sun poured its stifling heat down
on the great desert where nothing save
an occasional clump of sage brush could
be seen

  heat shimmered in the air and it was
not strange that the young cyclists were
disheartened and ready to give up in de-
spair

  suddenty a cry came from diamond

  look he shouted look to the
south why havent we seen it before
were blind  water water 

  they looked and at a distance of less
than a mile it seemed they could see a
beautiful lake of water with trees on the
distant shore the reflection of the trees
showed in the mirror-like surface of the
blue lake

  come on hoarsely cried jack as he
turned his wheel southward ill be
into that water up to my neck in less
than ten minutes

  stop shouted merriwell

  jack did not seem to hear if he
heard he did not heed the command
he was bending far over the handle-bars
and using all his energy to send his
wheel spinning toward the beautiful lake

  i must step him cried frank it
is a race for life

chapter ii

a race for life

  a race for life on the great desert be-
neath a burning pitiless sun

  frank merriwell forgot that a short
time before jack diamond had accused
him of leading them all to their doom by
	fkank mekriweltj on tiie desert

indncing them to attempt to cross the
barren waste-he forgot everything save
that a comrade was in danger

  no he did not forget everything he
knew what that race meant it might
exhaust them both and render them un-
able to ride their wheels over the few re-
maining miles of barren desert between
them and the mountain range when
diamond learned the dreadful heartsick-
ening truth about that beautiful lake of
water it might rob his heart of courage
and hope so that he would drop in de-
spair and give himself up to death in the
desert

  frank would save him-he must save
him  he felt a personal responsibility for
the lives of every one of the party and
he had resolved that all should return to
new haven in safety

  stop jack he shouted again

  but the sight of that beautiful lake
had made diamond mad with a longing
to plunge into the water to splash in it
to drink his fill till not another swallow
could he force down his throat

  madly he sent his wheel flying over
the sandy plain panting gasping furious
to reach the lake

  how beautiful the water looked  how
cool and inviting was the shade of the
trees on the other shore oh he would
go round there and rest beneath those
trees

  frank bent forward over the handle
bars muttering

 ride now as you never rode before

  the wheel seemed to leap away like a
thing of life-it flew as if it possessed
wings

  but frank did not gain as swiftly as he
desired for diamond also was using all
his energy to send his bicycle along

  faster faster panted frank

  faster and faster he flew along the
hot breath of the desert beat on his face
as if it came rushing from tlie mouth of
a furnace it seemed to scorch him fine

particles of sand whipped up and stung
his flesh

  but he minded nothing save that he
was racing to save the life of his friend
and comrade his teeth were set and
there was a look of undying determination
on his dust-clouded face

  gaining-yes he was gaining at last
but slowly-far too slowly

  faster faster he panted once more
speaking to his wheel as if it were a
thing of life and could understand on
my silent steed we must stop him
soon 

  he heard a strange laugh-a wild
laugh

  heaven pity him  thought frank
knowing that laugh came from jacks
lips the sight of that ghostly lake has
nearly turned his brain with joy i fear
he will go mad indeed when he knows
the truth 

  on sped pursued and pursuer and the
latter was still gaining frank merriwell
had engaged in many contests of skill
and endurance but never in one where
more was at stake his success in over-
taking his friend meant the saving of a
human life-perhaps two lives

  now he was gaining swiftly and some-
thing like a prayer of thankfulness came
from his lips

  once more he cried out to the lad in ad-
vance but it seemed that diamonds ears
were dumb for he made no sound that
told he heard

  one last spurt-frank felt that it must
bring him to diamonds side he gath-
ered himself his feet clinging to the fly-
ing pedals as if fastened there

  a slip a fall a miscalculation might
mean utter failure and failure might
mean death for diamond

  now frank was close behind his friend
he could hear the whirring sound of the
spokes of diamonds wheel cutting tehe
air and he could hear the hoarse pant-
ing breathing of his friend
frank merriwell on the desert	

  a steady hand guided merriwells
wheel alongside that of his friend  a
steady and a strong hand fell on the
shoulder of the lad who had been crazed
by the alluring vision of the lake in the
desert

  stop jack

  diamond turned toward his friend a
face from which a pair of glaring eyes
looked out his lips curled back from
his white teeth and he snarled

  hands off dont try to hold me
back cant you see it you fool the
lake-the lake

  there is no lake

  yes there is you are blind see
it

  stop jack  i tell you there is no
lake

  frank tried to check his friend but
diamond made a swinging blow at him
which merriwell managed to stop

  wait-listen a moment entreated
frank

  but the belief that a lake of water lay
a short distance away had completely
driven anything like reason from dia-
monds head

  hands off he shouted if you try
to stop me youll be sorry

  frank saw he must resort to desperate
measures he secured a firm grip on the
shoulder of the young virginian and a
moment later gave a surge that caused
them both to fall from their wheels

  they were whirling along at such
speed that it was no light thing to take a
fall but down they went togetier and
by a good stroke of fortune they hap-
pened to fall clear of the wheels

  as frank had pulled diamond toward
him he fell beneah and the shock when
he struck the ground drove the breath
from his body it also robbed him of
strength for a moment

  over and over they rolled and then
lay in a limp heap on the desert where

the earth was hot and baked and tlie sun
beat down with a fierce parching heat

  diamond was the first to stir and he
tried to scramble up his one thought be-
ing to mount his wheel again and ride
onward toward that shimmering lure

  frank seemed to realize this for he
caught at his friend grasped him and
held him fast

  with a mad exclamation the hot-
blooded southerner turned and struck
merriwell in the face with his clinched
fist

  it was a feeble blow for the shock of
the fall had deprived diamond of no little
strength but it stung and it aroused
frank in a marvellous manner

  then there was a furious struggle
there on the desert diamond making a
mad effort to break away but being held
by frank who would not let him go

  the eyes of both lads glared and their
teeth were set frank tried to force dia-
mond down and hold him but jack had
the strength of an insane person and
time after time he flung his would-be
benefactor off

  the eyes of the young virginian were
red and bloodshot while his lips were
cracked and bleeding his cap was gone
and his straight dark hair fell in a
tousled mass over his forehead

  occasionally muttered words came
from diamonds lips but the other was
silent seeming to realize that he must
conquer the mad fellow by sheer strength
alone

  so they fought on their efforts grow-
ing weaker and weaker gasping for
breath seeing that fierce struggle 
one could have imagined they were any-
thing but the most deadly enemies
battling for their very lives

  at last after some minutes diamonds
fictitious strength suddenly gave out and
then frank handled and held him with
ease merriwell pinned jack down and
held him there while both remained -
frank mekriwell on the desert

tionless gasping for breath and seeking
to recover from their frightful exertions

you fool whispered the virginian
bitterly what are you trying to do
trying to save your life but you have
given me a merry hustle for itanswered
frank

  save my life  bah why have you
stopped me when we were so near that
lake

  there is no lake

  are you blind all of us could see
the lake itis near-very near

  i tell you jack there is no lake
  you lie

  you have been crazed by what you
fancied was water some time you will
ask my pardon for your words

  you will ask my pardon for stopping
me in this manner frank merriwell
you did it because i was the first to dis-
cover the lake you were jealous you
did not wish me to reach it first i know
you  you want to be the leader in every-
thing 

  if you were not half crazy now you
would not utter such words jack

  oh i know you-i know

  then diamonds tone and manner sud-
denly changed and he began to beg
please let me up merry-please do
ohmerciful heaven lam perishing for
a swallow of watei  and it is so near
there is water enough for ten thousand
men and such beautiful trees where
the shadows are so cool-where this ac-
cursed sun cant pour down on ones
head please let me up frank ill do
anything for you if youll only let me go
to that lake

  jack dear old fellow i am telling
you the truth when i say there is no lake
there could be no lake here in this burn-
ing desert it is an impossibility if
there were such a lake the ones i asked
about the water-holes would have told
me  

 they did not know i have seen it
and i know it is there

  frank allowed his friend to sit up
  look jack he said where is your
  lake

 jack looked away to the south the
 east the north and then toward the west
 where lay the mountains

  there was no lake in sight

chapter iii

on to the mountains

 where-where has it gone slowly
 and painfully asked diamond i am sure
 i saw it-sure the lake the trees-all
 gone

  i told you there was no lake

 then-then it must have been a
 mirage 

  that is exactly what it was

  with a deep groan of despair diamond
  fell back limply the sand as if the last
  bit of strength and hope had gone from
  him

 this ends it he gasped whats
 the use of struggling any more we may
 as well give up right here and die
 not much cried merriwell with
 attempted cheerfulness that is why i
 run you down and dragged you from
 your wheel

 what do you mean

  i knew the mirage might lure you on
  and on into the desert seeming to flee be-
  fore you till at last it would vanish in a
  mocking manner and you titterly ex-
  hausted and spirit-broken would lie
  down and die without another effort
  jack was silent a few moments

  and you did all this for me he fin-
  ally asked you pursued and pulled me
  from my wheel to-to save me

 yes

  another brief silence-
  frank

 well jack

  i-i think i struck you
frank merriwell on the desert



  yes said merriwell cheerfully
but you were too exhausted to hurt me
it didnt amount to anything

  but i struck you just the same
  sure

  i was mad 

  you looked it 

  my thirst-the sight of what i took
to be water-the shadows of the trees
ah yes i was mad frank

  well its all over now

  yes it is all over the jigs up
nonsense get a brace on old man
we must get to the mountains it is our
only chance jack

  the mountains i never shall reach
the mountains frank i am done for-
played out

  thats all rot old fellow you are
no more played out than i am we are
both pretty well used up but well pull
through to the mountains and get a drink
of water  

  you never give up

  well i try never to give up
frank i want you to forgive me for
what i said before we saw the mirage
you know i was making a kick

  o never mind that its all right
jack

  i want you to say you forgive me
thats dead easy of course i for-
give you think im a stiff to hold a
grudge over a little matter like that
diamond looked his admiration from
his bloodshot eyes

  youre all right merry he hoarsely
declared you always were all right i
knew it all along sometimes i get nasty
for i have a jealous nature- although i
try to hold it in check i never did try
to hold myself in check in any way till i
knew you and saw how you controlled
your tastes and passions that was a
revelation to me merry you know i
hated you at first but i came to admire
you despite myself i have admired you
ever since sometimes the worst side of
my nature will crop out but i always
know i am wrong forgive me for strik-
ing you 

  there there old chap why are
you thinking of such silly things you
are talking as if you had done me a dead-
ly wrong and this was your last chance
to square yourself

  it is my last chance-i am sure of
that i am played out and i cant drive
that wheel further its no use-i throw
up the sponge right here

  a look of determination came to
franks face

  you shall not do anything of the
kind he cried i wont have it
jack

  diamond did not reply but la limp
 the ground frank put a firm hand
on his shoulder saying

  come jack make a bluff at it

  no use

  i tell you it is come on we can
reach the mountains within an hour
the mountains came huskily from
diamonds lips god knows if there
are any mountains they too may be
a mirage

  no no

  think-think how long we have been
riding toward them and still they seemed
to remain as far away as they were hours
ago 

  that is one of the peculiar effects of
the air out here 

  i do not believe any of us will reach
the mountains and if we should we
might not find water those mountains
look baked and barren

  remember i was told how to find
water there

  but this did not give the disheartened
boy courage

  i know you were told but the man
who told you said that at times that water
failed its no use frank  the game is
not worth the candle

  then it was that merriwell began to
grow angry

  i am ashamed of you diamond he
harshly cried i did think you were
built of better stuff where is your back-
bone come man you must make an-
other try

  must came rather defiantly from
jack ill not be forced to do it

  yes you will

  the virginian looked at frank in as-
tonishment

  what do you mean he asked

  i mean that you will brace up and
make an attempt to reach the mountains
with the rest of us or ill give you the
blamedest licking you ever had-and


frank merriwell on the desert

there wont be any apologies afterward
either

  that aroused jack somewhat

 you-you wouldnt do that-now
he faltered

  wouldnt i cried frank seeming
to make preparations to carry out his
threat well youll see

 bu t-but-

  there are no buts about it either
you get up and make one inure struggle
or ill have the satisfaction of knowing
you are not in condition to make a
struggle when i leave you that is busi-
ness audits straight from the shoulder
diamond remonstrated weakly but
frank seemed in sober earnest

  i believe it would do you good he
declared it would beat a little sense
into you its what you want anyway
a sense of shame came over jack

  if youve got enough energy to give
me a licking i ought to have enough to
make another try for lifelie huskily
said

  of course you had

  well ill do it it isnt because i
fear the licking for that wouldnt make
any difference now but i can make an-
other try for it if you can 

  frank dragged the other boy to his
feet and then picked up their fallen
wheels jack was so weak that he could
scarcely stand seeming to have been
quite exhausted by his last furious strug-
gle with the boy who had raced across
the desert sands to save his life twice
frank caught him and kept him from
falling

  whats the use diamond hoarsely
whispered i tell you i cant keep in
the saddle

  and i tell you that you must there
are the other fellows coming this way
i will signal them to ride toward the
mountains and we will join them
frank made the signal and tiie others
understood for they soon turned toward
the mountains again

  then merriwell aided jack in mount-
ing and getting started mounting himself
after that and hurrying after the virgin-
ian whose wheel was making a very
crooked track across the sand

 when it was necessary frank sup-
ported jack with a hand on the arm of

the dark-faced lad speaking encouraging
words into his ear urging him on

  and thus they rode toward the barren-
looking desert range where they must
find water or death

chapter iv

at the water hole

  they came to the mountains at last
when the burning sun was hanging a ball
of fire in the western sky from a dis-
tance merriwell had singled out split
peak which had served as his guide at
the foot of split peak were two water-
holes one on the east and one  the
south

  first frank sought for the eastern
water-hole and he found it

  but it was dry

  dry save for the slightest indication of
moisture in the sand at the bottom of the
hole

  i told von gasped diamond as he
fell to the ground in hopeless exhaustion
there is  water here

  wait said frank hoarsely well
see if we cant find some come boys
we must scoop out the sand down there
in the hole-we must dig for our lives

  by golly said toots dis niggers
reddy teh dug a well foty foot deep if
he can fine about fo swallers ob wattah 

  a well muttered rattleton well
sink a shaft here 

  well i dont know murmured
browning

  so they went to work two of them
digging a time and with their hands
they scooped out the sand down in the
water-hole as they worked a little dirty
water began to trickle into the hole

  yum yum muttered toots his
eyes shining nebber saw muddy
wattah look so good befo t done fink i
can drink bout n bariel ob dat stuff

  they worked till quite exhausted and
then waited impatiently for the water to
run into the hole it rose with disheart-
ening slowness but rise it did

  when he could do so frank dipped
up some of the water with his drinking
cup and gave it to jack first of all

  diamonds hands shook so with eager-
ness that he nearly spilled the water and
frank merriwell on the desert



lie greedily turned it down his parched
throat at a gulp

  merciful goodness how sweet he
gasped more frank-more

  wait a bit my boy you have had
the first drink from this hole the oth-
ers must take their turn now when it
conies round to you again you shall have
more 

  but there may not be enough to go
round jack almost snarled what
good do you think a little like that can
do a fellow who is dying of thirst i
must have more-now

  well you cant have another drop
till the others have taken their turn-not
a taste

  when frank merriwell spoke like that
he meant what he said and jack knew
it but the little water he had received
had maddened diamond almost as much
as had the mirage as frank turned to-
ward the water-hole jack started to
spring upon him crying

  well see

  hold   said browning as one of
his hands went out and grasped diamond
i wouldnt do that you are excited i
reckon ill have to sit on you while you
cool off  

  then the big fellow took jack down
and actually sat  him while the vir-
ginian raved like a maniac

   poor fellow  said frank pityingly
he has almost lost his reason by what
he has passed through

  one by one the others received some of
the water and then it came jacks turn
once more by this time he was silent
but theie was a sullen light in his eyes
when frank passed him the water in the
drinking cup he shook his head and re-
fused to take it

  no he muttered i wont have it
drink it all up you dont care an-
thing about me let me die

  well hang a fool snorted brown-
ing in great disgust

  say jes yo pass dat wattah heah
marser frank an see if dis coonll re-
fuse teh let it percolate down his froat
yes give it to toots grated dia-
mond you morethink of him than
you do of me anyway give it to him 
dont chool with that fump-i mean
dont fool with that chump snapped

rattleton let him have his own way
hes got a bug in his head  thats what
ails him 

  let him alone bruce said frank
quietly i want to talk to him

  he struck at you behind your back
never mind  he wont do so again
oh you dont know muttered dia-
mond

  yes i do declared frank with con-
fidence never mind us fellows i
want a little quiet talk with jack

  they understood him and the two lads
were left alone

  frank began talking to diamond in a
smooth pleasant way appealing to his
sense of justice at first jack turned
away as if he did not care to listen but
he heard every word and he was affected

  you are not yourself old fellow
paid jack softly placing his hand gently
 diamonds shoulder if you were
yourself you would not be like this it
is the burning desert the blazing sun
the frightful thirst-these have made you
so unlike yourself i dont mind any-
thing you have said about me jack for
i know you are my friend and jou would
not think of saying such things under or-
dinary circumstances a little while ago
away out  the desert you told me as
much it was then that reason came back
to you for a little time knowing how
you have suffered i gave you the first
drink from this water-hole the water
ran in slowly and  did not know that
there would be enough to go round twice
you were not the only one who had suff-
ered from thirst but the others made no
objection to your having the first drink-
they wanted you to have it but it was
necessary that they should have some of
the water so that all of us would be in
condition to search for the other water-
hole surely old fellow you see the
common sense in this and now jack
look-the water has cleared and more is
running into the hole it will quench
your thirst and you will be yourself
again you are my friend and i am
yours we stand read to fight for each
other at any time if one of my enemies
were to try to get at me behind my back

why you would-

  strangle the infernal cur shouted
diamond give me that water frank


frank merriwell on the desert

you are all right and im all wrong
just let me have a chance to fight for you
and see if i dont fight as long as there is
a drop of blood in my body

  merriwell had conquered but he
showed no sign of triumph although he
quietly said

  i knew all the while dear old fellow
in fact i believe i know you better than
you know yourself

  then when the others came up ready
to jolly diamond about refusing to drink
frank checked them with a gesture

  jack felt better when he had taken the
second drink of water as water had
risen in the hole ali the boys were able
to get another round and the spirits of all
of them were raised

  i believe we have some hard bread and
jerked beef havent we merry asked
browning

  yes

  well we are all right then cant
knock us out now all i need is a good
chance to rest

  oh you need rest nodded rattle-
ton you always need that you can
take more rest and not complain than any
fellow i ever saw

  young man said bruce loftily it
wont work i refuse to let you get me
on a string so drop it

  youll be lucky if you get out of this
part of the country without getting on a
string with the other end hitched to the
limb of a tree 

  that reminds me drawled bruce
at the last town where we stopped i
asked a citizen if there were any horse
thieves in that locality and he said there
were two of em hanging round there
the night before

  yes nodded harry that was the
place where they said they were going to
stop lynching if they had to hang every
durned lyncher they could catch

  boys laughed merriwell we are
all right when you chaps get to spring-
ing those things i feel there is no further
danger well pull out all right

  suttinly sar grinned toots is
gwan teh bet mall money on dis crowd
ebry time chilluns wes hot stuff an
dar aint nuffin gwan teh stop us dis
side ob san frandisco-no sar

chapter v

    the mysterious skeleton
finally refreshed and filled with new
hope the boys mounted their wheels and
started to seek for the second water-hole

  frank led the way and they turned to
the south riding along the base of some
barren cliffs

  are you sure well be able to find
our way back to the water-hole we have
left if we fail to discover the other one
asked rattleton

  i am taking note of everything and i
do not think there will be any difficulty 
answered frank

  they had proceeded in this manner for
about two miles when they saw before
them a place where the barren cliffs
opened into a pass that seemed to lead
into the mountains

  there is our road cried merriwell
cheerfully feit should lead us straight to
the second water-hole

 yah yah laughed toots
cayarnt fool dat boy chilluns he
knows his business yo bet wont
sprise me a bit if he teks us stret to a
resyvoyer-no sar   

  they made for the pass and in a burst
of energy the colored boy spurted to the
front taking the lead

  of a sudden as they approached a
point where the bluffs narrowed till they
were close together the negro gave a sud-
den wild howl of terror tried to turn his
wheel about and went plunging headlong
to the ground

  scrate gott gasped rattleton
whats struck him

  something is the matter with him
sure as fate said frank

  toots was seen to sit up and stare to-
ward the wall of stone while it was plain
that he was shaking as if struck by an
attack of ague then he tried to scramble
up but fell on his knees with his hands
clasped and uplifted in a supplicating at-
titude while he wildly cried 

  go way dar good mr debbil i
aint done nuffin teh yo please don
touch me is nuffin but a po good-
fo-nuffin nigger an i aint wuff bod-
derin wif-no sar dar am some white
boys wif me an i guess yoll lek them a
heap sight better jes yo tek one of
them good mr debbil
frank merriwell on the desert



  has he gone daffy to muttered
frank in astonishment

  then the boys came whirling up and
sprang from their wheels at which toots
made a scramble for frank caught hold
of his knees and chatteringly cried 
don yeh let him kerry me off
marser frank  i knows yo aint afeared
of ntiffin so i wants yeh ter protect po
toots from de debbil wif de fiery eyes
but frank was so astonished that he
scarcely heard a word the colored boy
uttered

  seated on a block of stone in a niche
of the wall was a human skeleton it
was sitting bolt upright and seemed to be
staring at the boys with eyes that flashed
a hundred shades of light

  poly hoker-no holy poker pal-
pitated harry leaning hard on his wheel
what have we struck

  for a time the others were speechless
wonderfully and fantastically was the
skeleton decorated on its head was a
rude crown that seemed to be of glittering
gold while gold bracelets adorned its
arms aborit the flesh less neck was a
chain of gold to which a large locket was
attached and across the ribs was strung a
gold watch chain while there were other
fantastic and costly ornaments dangling
over those bones of a human being

  the eyes of the skeleton flashiug so
many different lights seemed to be two
huge diamonds of enormous value

  no wonder the young cyclists stared in
astonishment at the marvellously be-
jeweled skeleton 

  well drawled browning with his
usual nonchalance the gentleman
seems to have dressed up in his best to
receive us someone must have sent
him word we were coming

  toots seeing the others did not seem
frightened had got on his feet and picked
up his bicycle

  goodness muttered diamond if
all those decorations are solid gold there
is a small fortune in sight

  what is the meaning of this frank
asked rattleton how do you suppose
this skeleton happens to be here

  ask me something easy said merri-
well shaking his head

  the skeleton must have been decor-

ated in that manner by some living per-
son asserted rattleton

  but where is that person

  not here that is sure

  it may be a warning said jack
gloomily

  warning nothing exclaimed
frank it is plain the thing has been
left there by some person and we are the
discoverers it must be that the skeleton
is that of some poor devil who perished
here for want of water

  and it may be that the one who
placed it there perished also said rat-
tleton

  very likely

  in which case came eagerly from
jacks lips all that treasure belongs to
us boys it is a wonderful stroke of for-
tune we have made enough to take the

whole of us through yale and-

  if we ever get back to yale old fel-
low this unfortunate fellow perished
here and our fate may be similar

  boo shivered browning thats
pleasant to think about

  more than that frank went on
the treasure does not belong to us if we
can find the real owner or his heirs
the excitement and interest of the
boys was great they were eager to ex-
amine the decorations of the mysterious
skeleton

  well stack our wheels and then one
of us can climb up and make an inspec-
tion said frank

  so they proceeded to stack their
wheels toots observing

  yo can fool wif dat skillertou if yo
wants to chilluns but dis niggers gwan
teh keep right away from it bet fo dol-
lars it will jes reach out dem arms an
grab de firs one dat gits near it wo-oh 
land ob wartermillions it meks me
have de fevah an chillins jes to fink ob
it

  well draw lots to see who goes
up said frank winking at the others
you will have to go if it falls to you
toots 

  oh mah goodness gasped the
frightened darky i aint gwan teh
draw  lots marser frank-no sar is
got a poerful bad case ob lieart-trouble
an mah doctali hab reckermended dat i
dont fool roun no skillertons he said


frank merriwell on the desert

it might result distrus if i boddered wif
skillertons 

   whats that cried frank sternly
would you drink your share of water
when water is so precious and not take
even chances with the rest of us in any
danger 

  now marser frank cried the
darky appealingly don go fo to be
too hard on a po nigger de trubble
wif me is dat im jes a naclieral bon
coward an i cant git over hit nohow
dats what meks mail heart turn flip-flops
ebry time dars any dangar sar 

   but think of the treasure up there that
we have found if it should fall to you
to investigate and you were to bring
down that treasure of course you would
receive your share the same as the rest
of us 

   lawd bress yeh honey i don want
no treasure if ive gotter go an fotcli hit
down id a heap sight rudder nebber
hab no treasure dan git wifin reachin
distance of dat skillerton-yes sar
dont fool with him merry said
diamond impatiently of course you
dont expect to send him up and you
wont think of giving him any part of the
treasure 

   frank flashed a look at the virginian
and saw that jack was in earnest

  you are mistaken old man he
said i do not expect toots to go up
there but if there is a real treasure and
it is divided you may be sure he will re-
ceive his share 

  oh well cried jack somewhat
taken aback  of course i dont care what
you do about that but i thought you
were in earnest about what you were say-
ing

  the trouble with you muttered
rattleton speaking so low that jack
could not hear him is that you never
see through a joke

  come spoke browning if weve
got to take chances to see who goes up
and makes the examination come on i
hope to get out of it myself but if i
must i must

  we need not take chances said
frank promptly i will go

   it will not be difficult for it is no
climb at all said jack two of us can

swing ourselves up there in a moment
and i will go with you merry

then it was that rattleton suddenly
gave a great cry of stupefied amazement
whats the matter asked merriwell
look look gasped harry pointing
toward the niche in the rocks the
skeleton-it has disappeared

  they looked and dumb for the time
with amazement and dismay they saw
rattleton spoke the truth

the mysterious skeleton had vanished

chapter vi

indians

  gone cried jack

  sure nodded frank

  lordy massy sakesteh goose-grease
gasped toots again shivering with ter-
ror didnt i done tole yeh chilluns
if yo know when yo am well off yeh
git erway from heali jes as quick as yeh
can trabbel oh mail goodness

  shaking in every limb the colored boy
tried to get his bicycle out from the oth-
ers lost his balance fell over and sent
the entire stack of wheels crashing to the
ground

  well this seems to be a regular
sleight-of-hand performance coolly
commented browning now you see it
and now you dont guess where its
gone it drives me to a cigarette

  but he discovered that his cigarettes
were gone which seemed to concern him
far more than the vanishing of the skele-
ton he declared he had lost a whole
package and seemed to feel quite as bad
about it as if they were solid gold
rattleton was excited

  what sort of pocus-hocus-no hocus-
pocus is this anyway he spluttered
wheres it gone who waved the old
thing a took-i mean who took the old
thing away

  it couldnt have gone away of its own
accord said frank so some one must
have removed it 

  don yeh fool yosef dat way
marser frank cried toots sitting up
amid the fallen wheels dat skillerton
am de berry ol scratch hissef de next
thing some ob dis crowd will be disum-
pearin dat way gwan teh git kerried
off chilluns if yo don git out ob dis in
a hurry 
frank merriwell on the desert



  oh shut lip snapped diamond
you make me tired with your chatter
mistali dimund said the colored
boy with attempted dignity if voll let
dat debbil kerry yo off yoll nebber be
missed-no sar

  jack pretended he did not hear those
words

  here goes to see what has become of
the thing cried frank as he scrambled
up to the niche where the skeleton had
sat

  i am with you cried diamond as
he followed frank closelj

  reaching the nook in the face of the
cliff they looked about for some sign of
the skeleton that had been there a short
time before but not a sign of it could
they see the ghastly thing was gone
and the glittering ornaments had van-
ished with it the block of stone on
which the object had sat was still there

  well fat do you wliind-i mean
what do you find cried rattleton im-
patiently

  not a thing was the disgusted re-
ply it has gone sure as fate

  so have my cigarettes groaned
browning

  the treasure-is any of that there
asked harry eagerly

  not a bit of it 

  well thats what i call an unfair
deal  murmured bruce it is a blow
below the belt if the old skeleton had
desired to go away none of us would
have objected but it might have left the
trimmings with which it was adorned
frank was puzzled and the more he
investigated the greater grew his wonder
he knew they had seen the skeleton yet
it had vanished like fog before a blazing
sun

  jack shrugged his shoulders and shiv-
ered saying

  theres something uncanny about it
old man i believe it is a warning
nonsense cried frank what sort
of a warning

  a warning of the fate that awaits all
of us

  you are not well jack

  oh it is not that first we see a lake
of water and that disappears then we
see this skeleton and now that has van-

ished you must confess that there is
something remarkable in it all

  the vanishing of the mirage came

about in a natural manner but-

  but ou must confess there was some-
thing decidedly unnatural about the van-
ishing of the skeleton

  it was removed by human hands-i
will wager anything on that

  then where is the human being who
remove it

  i dont know

  unable to remain below rattleton
came climbing up to the niche

  ive got to satisfy myself he said
as he felt about with his hands as if he
expected to discover the vanished skele-
ton in that manner i cant see how
the blamed old thing could get away
well you can see quite as well as we
can acknowledged frank it is
gone and that is all we can tell about
it

  the boys satisfied themselves that the
thing had really disappeared and they
could not begin to solve the mystery
after a time they returned to the ground

  it am de debbils work asserted
toots don yell mek no misteks bout
dat chilluns

  they held a council of war and it
was resolved that they should go on
through the pass and try to find the sec-
ond water-hole before darkness fell

  already night was close at hand and
they must needs lose no time

  we can come back here in the morn-
ing and see if were able to solve the
mystery said merriwell i for one
do not feel like going away without mak-
ing another attempt at it

  nor i nodded rattleton

  it is folly  declared jack gloomily
i say we have been warned and the
best thing we can do is get away as soon
as possible 

  by golly dat am de firs sensibul
fing ive heard yo say in fo days cried
toots approvingly

  they picked up their wheels and soon
were ready to mount

   heres good-by to the vanishing skele-
ton ior to-night cried frank

  he was answered by a wild peal of
mocking laughter that seemed to run


frank merriwell on the desert

along the face of the cliff in a most re-
markable manner

  ha ha ha it sounded hoarsely
and ha ha ha came down from the
rocks like a mystic echo

  o-oh lordy

  toots made a jump for the saddle of
his bicycle but jumped too far and went
clean over the wheel striking his knee
and turning in the air to fall with a
thump on the back of his neck

  mah goodness he gurgled as he
lay on the ground dazed by the shock
of the fall de ol debbil done gib meh
a boost then fo snail

  the other lads looked at each other in
perplexity

  well wh-wh-what do you think of
that stammered rattleton

  he ought to file his voice whoever
he is coolly observed browning its
a little rough along the edges

  it strikes me that somebody is having
fun with us said merriwell a look of
displeasure on his face

  what are we going to do about it
asked harry

  we dont seem able to do much of
anything now come on 

  toots scrambled up and they mounted
their wheels as they started to ride
away a hollow-sounding voice cried
stop

  oh riv us a guest-i mean give us a
rest flung back rattleton

  stop repeated the mysterious voice
do not try the pass there is danger
beyond turnback

i told you it was a warning cried
jack what do you think of it now
i think somebody is trying to have a
lot of sport with us exclaimed frank
well what are you going to do
not a thing i dont propose to pa
any attention to it come on fellows
we must have more water and theres
none too much time to find it before
dark

  diamond was tempted to declare he
would not go any further but he knew
the others would stand by frank and so
he pedaled along

  as they drew away from the spot where
they had seen the skeleton they heard
the mysterious voice calling tg them
again commanding them to stop and

turn back thus it continued till they
had ridden on so that it could be heard
no longer

  despite himself frank had been im-
pressed by what he had seen and heard
and a feeling of awe was on him ahead
the shadows were thick where the dark
cliffs seemed to come together and there
was something grim and overpowering
about the bare and towering mountains
that sullenly frowned down upon the lit-
tle party

  the boys were silent for they had no
words to speak each was busy with his
thoughts and those thoughts were not of
the most pleasant character

  a feeling of lieartsickening loneliness
settled down upon them and made them
long for the homes that were so far away
what satisfaction was there after all in
this great ride across the continent
they had encountered innumerable perils
and now it seemed that they were over-
shadowed by the greatest peril oi all

  how still it was the mountains
seemed like crouching monsters of the
great desert waiting there to spring upon
and crush them out of existence there
was something fearsome and frightful in
their grim air of waiting

  the whirring of the wheels was a warn-
ing whisper or the deadly hiss of a ser-
pent as they passed between the frown-
ing bluffs which rose on either hand the
whirring sound seemed to become louder
and louder till it was absolutely awesome

  frank looked back and of all the party
bruce browning was the only one whose
face remained stolid and impassive it
did not seem that he had been affected in
the least by what had happened

  he has wonderful nerve thought
merriwell

  diamonds dark face seemed pale and
there was an anxious look on the face of
rattleton toots betrayed his excitement
and fear most distinctl

  frank feared they would not get
through the pass in time to find the sec-
ond water-hole  and he increased his
speed 

  the ground was favorable for swift
riding at that time merriwell thought
it fortunate but later he changed his
mind

  of a sudden the pass between the
frank merriwell on the desert



bluffs ended and they shot out into a
valley or basin

  a cry of astonishment and alarm came
from franks lips and he used all his
energy to check and turn his flying
wheel

  before them blazed a fire and around
that fire were gathered-

  indians palpitated harry rattle-
ton

chapter vii

   blue wolf tries the bicycle
indians echoed jack diamond
indians grunted bruce browning
astonished

  o-oli lordy gasped  toots dis
am whar a nigger boy i know is gwan teh
lose his scalp fo suah 

  turn commanded frank-turn to
the left and well make a run to get back
through the pass

  but they were seen and the redskins
about the fire sprang to their feet with
loud whoops

  at the first whoop toots gave a howl
and threw up both hands

  don yo shoot good mistar in-
junses he shouted is jes a common
brack nigger an i aint no count no-
how mali scalp wouldn be no good teh

yo arter-

  then he took a header off his wobbling
machine and fell directly before jack
whose bicycle struck his body and dia-
mond was hurled to the ground

  stop fellows cried merriwell
we mustnt run away and leave them
come back here

  from his wheel he leaped to the ground
in a moment running to diamonds side
grasping jack by the arm he exclaimed
up old fellow-up and onto your
wheel we may be able to get away
now well make a bluff for it

  but it was useless for jack was so
stunned that he could not get on his feet
though he tried to do so

  toots was stretched at full length on
the ground praying and begging the
good injunses not to bother with his
scalp saying the hair was so crooked that
it was no good nohow

  up came the redskins on a run and
surrounded the boys bruce and harry
having turned back

  browning assumed a defensive atti-
tude muttering

  well if were in for a scrap ill try
to get a crack at one or two of these
homely mugs before im polished off
there were seven of the indians and
nearly all of them carried weapons in
their hands although they were not in
war paint the were a decidedlj ugly
looking gang and their savage little eyes
denotedanytliing but friendliness

  ugh grunted the tallest indian of
the party an old fellow- with a scarred
and wrinkled face

 ugh ugh ugh grunted the
others

  then they stared at the boys and their
biccles the latter seeming a great curi-
osity to them

  well this is a scrolly old jape-i
mean a jolly old scrape fluttered rat-
tleton were in for it

  toots looked up saw the indians ut-
tered another wild howl and tried to
bury his head in the sand like an
ostrich

  frank singled out the tall indian and
spoke to him

  how do you do he said

	how returned the indian with
dignity

  unfortunately we did not know you
were here or we should not have called
explained merriwell

  the savage nodded the single black
feather in his hair fluttering like a pen-
nant as he did so

  um know he said urn see white
boy heap much surprised

  jee he can talk united states mut-
tered rattleton

  talk it said bruce in disgust
he can chew it thats all

  i trust we have not disturbed you
said frank calmly and we will leave
you in your glory as soon as my friend
who fell from his wheel is able to mount
and ride 

  no no quickly declared the tall
indian white boy no go way injun
like um heap much

  browning lifted his cap and felt for
his scalp

  it may be my last opportunity to ex-
amine it he murmured

  but we are in a hurry and we cant


frank merriwell on the desert

stop with you however much we may de-
sire to do so declared frank glibly
you see we are on urgent business
yes very urgent agreed rattleton
smoly hoke-no holy smoke dont i
wish i were back to new haven new
york any old place

  white boys must stop said the big
savage black feather say so that set-
tle urn 

  i am afraid it does confessed
browning

  diamond got upon his feet assisted by
frank

  well he said somewhat bitterly
this is what we have come to by failing
to heed the warning we received

  dont go to croaking snapped rat-
tleton these indians are peaceable
they are not on the war path

  but they are off the reservation
said frank in a low tone and that is
bad they have us foul ami there is no
telling what they may take a notion to
do

  its pretty sure theyll take a notion
to do us sighed harry

  fhe tall indian who had given his
name as black feather professed great
friendliness and when the boys told him
they had been looking for the water-hole
lie said 

  um water-hole dare by fire good
water heap much of it come have all
water um want 

  well that is an inducement con-
fessed browning we may be able to
get a square drink before we are scalped 
it was with no small difficulty that
toots was forced to get up and after he
was on his feet he would look at first one
indian and then dodge and look at an-
other each time gurgling

  o-oh lord

  and so surrounded by the indians the
boys moved over to the fire which was
near the water-hole as black feather
had declared

  well well all drinksaid frank as
he produced his pocket cup and proceeded
to fill it here fellows take turns
while they were doing so the indians
were examining their bicycles with great
curiosity it was plain the savages had
never before seen anything of the kind
and they were filled with astonishment

and mystification they grunted and
jabbered and then one of them decided to
get on and try one of the wheels

  it happened that this one was the
smallest shortest-legged redskin  of the
lot and he selected the machine with the
highest frame

  ugh he grunted white boy ride
two-wheel hoss injun him ride two-
wheel hoss heap same watch blue
wolf

  yes said browning softly nudg-
ing merriwell in the ribs with his elbow
watch blue wolf and you will see him
smash my bicycle i sincerely hope he
will break his confounded head at the
same time

  white boy show ijuu how um git
on ordered blue wolf

  go ahead bruce directed frank
oh thunder groaned the big fel-
low im sp tired 

  but he was forced to show the indians
how he mounted the wheel which he did
being dragged off almost as soon as he
got astride the saddle

  ugh grunted blue wolf with great
satisfaction um heap much easy
watch blue wolf

  yes watch blue wolf repeated
browning it will be good as a circus
oh my poor bicycle

  with no small difficulty the little in-
dian steadied the wheel reaching for-
ward to grasp the handle bars while
standing behind it the first time he
lifted his foot to place it on the step he
lost his balance and fell over with the
machine

  the other indians grunted and blue
wolf got up saying something in his
own language that seemed to make the
atmosphere warmer than it was before

  the bicycle was lifted and held for the
little indian to make arother trial he
looked as if he longed o kick it into a
thousand pieces but braced up placed
his foot on the step and made a wild leap
for the saddle he missed the saddle
struck astride the frame just back of the
handle bars uttered a wild howl of dis-
may and went down in hopeless entangle-
ment with the unfortunate machine
frank merriwell on the desert



chapter viii

  frank does some trick riding

  wow howled blue wolf

 oh my poor bicycle groaned
browning once more

  the fallen red man kicked the bicycle
into the air but it promptly came down
astride his neck and drove his nose into
the dirt

  ugh grunted the watching indians
solemnly

  wioop roared blue wolf spitting
out a mouthful of dirt

  then he made another frantic attempt
to cast the machine off but it persisted
in sticking to him in a wonderful manner
oie of his arms was thrust through the
spokes of the forward wheel to the shoul-
der and as he tried to yank it out the
rear wheel spun round and one of the
pedals gave him a terrific thump on the
top of the head

yah snarled the unlucky indian

  two wheel lioss kick a heap ob-
served black feather

  blue wolf tried to struggle to his feet
but he was so entangled with the bicycle
that it seemed to fling him down with
astonishing violence

  then as the noble red man kicked
and squirmed and struggled the bicycle
danced and pranced upon his prostrate
body like a thing of life

  o-o-oh wailed blue wolf in pain
and fear

  toots suddenly forgot his fears and
holding onto his side he doubled up with
a wild burst of coon laughter

  oh land ob wartermillions he
shouted dat bisuckle am knockin de
stuffin out ob mistah injun yah yah
yah lordy lordy scuse meh but i
has teh laff if it costs me all de wool on
mah liaid 

  browning folded his arms a look of
intense satisfaction on his face as he ob-
served 

  i have made a discovery that will be
worth millions of dollars to the govern-
ment of the united states now i know
a swift and sure way of settling the
indian question provide every indian in
the country with a bicycle and there will
be no indians left in a week or two

gamlets host-i mean hamlets

ghost chuckled rattleton holding his
hand over his mouth to keep from shriek-
ing with laughter i never saw any-
thing like that before

  merriwell sprang forward and assisted
blue wolf in untangling himself from
the wheel fearing the bicycle would be
utterly ruined

  the little indian was badly done up
his face was cut and bleeding in several
places and he was covered with dirt
with some difficulty he got upon his feet
and then he backed away from the
bicycle at which he glared with an ex-
pression of great fear on his countenance
heap bad medicine jhe observed

  it seemed that the other indians were
really amused although they remained
solemn and impassive

  give me hatchet blue wolf sud-
denly snarled heap fix two wheel
boss

  he would have made a rush for the
offending wheel but frank held up a
hand warningly crying

  beware blue wolf it is in truth bad
medicine and it will put a curse upon
you if you do it harm your squaw will
die of hunger before another moon your
children shall make fooc for the coyotes
and your bones shall bleach on the
desert beware

  blue wolf paused dismay written on
his face he longed to smash the bicycle
but he was convinced that it was really
bad medicine  and he was afraid to
injure it

  say that is great old man enthu-
siastically whispered rattleton in merri-
wells ear keep it up

  blue wolf not hurt two wheel hoss
declared black feather who seemed to
be the chief of the little band want to
see white boy ride

  do you mean that you want me to
ride asked frank

 ugh

  all right said frank ill show
you how it is done

  then he motioned for the savages to
stand aside

  no try to run way warned black
feather injun shoot urn

  all right your royal jiblets if i try
to run away you may take a pop at me


frank merriwell on tie desert

  they made room for frank to mount
and ride

  standing beside the wheel frank
sprung into the saddle without using the
step caught the pedals and started

  the savages gave utterance to a grunt
of wonder and admiration

  frank had practiced trick riding and
he now proposed to exhibit his skill feel-
ing that it might be a good scheme to
astonish the savages

  he started the bicycle into a circle
round which he rode with the greatest
ease and then of a sudden he passed one
leg over the frame and stood up one oue
of the pedals which he kept in motion at
the same time

  the indians nodded and looked pleased

  then frank began to step cross-legged
from pedal to pedal passing his feet over
the cross bar of the frame and keeping
the wheel in motion all the time

  a moment later he whirled about and
with his face toward the rear continued
to pedal the bicycle ahead the same as if
he had been seated in the usual manner
on the saddle

  heap good  observed black feather

  then like a cat merriwell wheeled
about lifted his feet over the handlebars
to which he clung slipped down till he
hung over the forward wheel placed his
feet on the pedals and rode in that man-
ner this made it look as though he
were dragging the bicycle along behind
him

  there was a stir among the indians
and they looked at each other

  without stopping the bicycle frank
swung back over the handle bars to the
saddle having reached this position he
stopped suddenly turning the forward
wheel at an angle sitting there and grace-
fully balancing on the stationary machine

  heap much good declared black
feather growing enthusiastic

  oh those little things are dead easy 
assured frank with a laugh do you
really desire to see me do something that
is worth doing

  what more white boy can do

  several things but ill have to make
a larger circle 

  it was growing dark swiftly now the
sun being down and the shadows of the

mountains lying dark and gloomy in the
valleys

  go head directed black feather
frank started the bicycle in motion
and then with it going at good speed he
swung down on one side and slowly but
neatly crept through the frame coming
up  the other side and regaining the
saddle without stopping

  pale face boy great medicine said
black feather

  ugh grunted all the indians but
blue wolf

  the little savage was looking on in a
sullen wondering way astonished and
angered to think the white boy could do
all those things while he had been un-
able to mount the two wheeled horse

 how do you like that black
feather asked frankcheerfully

  much big confessed the chief do
some more

  all right catch onto this

  then away frank sped lifting the for-
ward wheel from the ground and letting
it hand suspended in the air while he
rode along on the rear wheel

  merry is working hard enough said
rattleton i never knew he could do so
many tricks 

  there are lost of things about that
fellow that none of us know anything
about asserted browning who was no
less surprised although he did not show
it

  he is a fool to work so hard tj please
these wretched savages muttered dia-
mond

  now dont you take frank merriwell
for a fool in anything came swiftly
from harry i never knew him to make
a fool of himself in all my life and i
have seen a good deal of him

  well why is he cutting up all those
monkey tricks what will it amount to
when it is all over

  wait and see

  the indians will treat us just the
same as if he had not done those things
perhaps so 

  of course they will

  now black feather old jiblets
cried frank in his merriest manner i
am going to do something else get onto
this 

  sending the bicycle along at high
frank merriwell on the desert



speed frank lay over the handlebars and
swung his feet into the air till he held
himself suspended in that manner head
down and feet up

  the indians were more pleased and as-
tonished than ever

 oh its all in knowing how
laughed frank as he gracefully and
lightly dropped back to the saddle

  again the indians grunted

  now black feather old chappie -
said frank i am going to do the great-
est trick of all ill have to get a big
start and have lots of room watch me
close

 away he went bending over the
handlebars and sending the bicycle flying
over the ground he acted as if he in-
tended to make a big circle but suddenly
turned and rode straight toward the pass
by which they had entered the basin
before the indians could realize his in-
tention he was almost out of sight in the
darkness of the young night

chapter ix

brownings ruse

  sudden howls of rage and dismay broke
from the indians the shouted after the
boy but he kept right on quickly disap-
pearing from view

  there sighed browning with satis-
faction i told you he was not doing all
that work for nothing fellows

  hes done gone an lef us wailed
toots

  thats what he has grated dia-
mond -left us to the mercy of these
miserable redskins thats a fine trick
oh will you ever get over it rasped
rattleton why shouldnt he he had
his chance and hed been a fool not to
skin out

  i thought he would stand by us in
such a scrape as this

  what you thought doesnt cut any
ice hell come back 

  after we are murdered

  rattleton would have said something
more but the indians who had been
holding an excited conversation suddenly
grasped the four remaining lads in a
threatening manner

  oh mah goodness palpitated toots
heah is whar is gwan teh lose mah

wool it am feelin poerful loose al-
ready 

  browning was on the point of launch-
ing out with his heavy fists and making
as good battle of it as he could when he
heard black feather say 

  no hurt white boys make um keep
still so um not run way off like odder
white boy that am all

  ill take chances on it muttered
bruce giving up quietly

  the four lads were forced to sit on the
ground and some of the savages squatted
near the fire was replenished and the
indians seemed to hold a council

  deciding how they will kill us said
diamond gloomily

  nothing of the sort declared rattle-
ton see them making motions toward
the bicycles they are-talking about the
wonderful two-wheeled horses

  gracious gasped toots dat meks
mah hair feel easier-

  browning held a hand on his stomach
in a pathetic manner

 oh my he murmured how
vacant and lonely my interior depart-
ment seems to be methinks i could
dine 

  the hard-bread and jerked beef
whispered jack it is in the carriers
attached to the wheels

  yes and we had better let it remain
there

 why

  these indians look hungry too
  you think--

  i do they will take it away from
us and eat it if we bring it out that
would leave us in a bad fix

  but they can get it out of the
carriers 

  they can but they wont

  why not

  they are afraid of those bicycles-so
afraid that they will not go near them
therefore our hard-bread and jerked-beef
is safe as long as we let it remain where
it is 

  harry agreed with bruce and they de-
cided not to touch the food in the car-
riers but all were thirsty again and they
expressed a desire to have another drink
from the water hole

  to this the indians did not object and
they took turns at drinking although the


frank merriwell on the desert

water did not taste nearly as sweet as it
had the first time

  having satisfied themselves in this
manner they sat down  the ground
once more being compelled to do so by
the red skins who were watching them
closely

  they have us in a bad position in
case they take a notion to crack us over
the head said harry we wouldnt
get a show 

  mah gracious gurgled toots hold-
ing fast to his scalp with both hands
wes gwan teh git it fo suah chilluns
de fus fing we know -we wont no
miffin

  we must get out of this somehow
muttered bruce

  thats right nodded jack merri-
well has taken care of himself and left us
to take care of ourselves

  he spoke in a manner that showed he
felt that frank had done them a great
wrong

  its a good thing he got away as he
did asserted harry now we know
we have a friend who is not a captive  ke
ourselves and we know he knows the fix
we are in you may be sure he will do
what he can for us

  hell do what he can for himself
how can he do anything for us

  hell find a way 

  i doubt it 

  you have become a great doubter
and kicker of late diamond it is certain
the loss of that mormon girl who married
the other fellow has soured you for you
were not this way before why dont you
try to forget her

  i wish you might forget her yon
make me sick talking about her so much 
i dontlike it at all

  if you dont like it lump it

  jack and harry glared at each other as
if they were on the point of coming to
blows and this gave browning an idea
he saw the indians had noticed there was
a disagreement between the boys and he
leaned forward saying in a low tone
keep at it fellows-keep at it i
have a scheme pretend you are fighting
and they will let you get on your feet
when i cry ready well all make a jump
for our wheels catch them up place
them in the form of a square and stand

within the square the redskins are
afraid of the wheels-think them bad
medicine they wont dare touch us
browning had made his idea clear with
surprising swiftness and the other boys
were astonished for they had come to
believe that the big fellow never had an
original idea in his head

  both jack and harry were taken by
the scheme and diamond quickly said 
its a go keep on with the quarrel
rattleton 

  harry did so and  a very few seconds
they were at it in a manner that seemed
intensely in earnest their voices rose
higher and higher and they scowled
fiercely flourishing their clinched hands
in the air and shaking them under each
others nose

  browning got into the game by making
a bluff at stopping the quarrel which
seemed to be quite ineffectual he seemed
to try to force himself between them but
rattleton hit him a hard crack  the
jaw with his fist with which he was
threatening diamond

  scissors gurgled bruce as he keeled
over  his back holding both hands to
his jaw what do you take me for-a
punching bag

  you have received what peacemakers
usually get said harry as he continued
to threaten diamond

  the indians looked on complacently
their appearance seeming to indicate that
they were mildly interested but did not
care a continental if the two white boys
hammered each other

  jack scrambled to his feet and dared
harry to get up harry declared he would
not take a dare and he got up then
bruce and toots lost no time in doing
likewise and just when it seemed that
the apparently angry lads were going to
begin hammering each other browning
cried 

  ready

  immediately the boys made a leap for
the bicycles caught them up formed a
square with them and stood behind the
machines like soldiers within a fort

  the indians uttered shouts of astonish-
ment and the four boys found themselves
looking into the muzzles of the guns in
the hands of the savages

  what white boys mean to do
frank merriwell on the desert



harshly demanded black feather no
can run away

  heap shoot um howled blue wolf
who seemed eager to slaughter the cap-
tives then no can run away

  hold on ordered browning witli a
calm wave of his hand we want to
parley 

  want to pow-wow asked black
feather

  thats it

  no pow-wow with white boys white
boys injuns prisoners no pow-wow with
prisoners 

  no shouted blue wolf shoot
um  shoot um

  land ob massy gurgled toots
dey am gwan teh shoot

  black feather said browning with
assumed assurance and dignity it will
not be a healthy thing for your men to
shoot us

  how how

  do you see that we- are protected by
the bad medicinemachines if you were
to do us harm now these machines would
utterly destroy you and every one of your
part the moment you fired at us these
machines would be like so many demons
let loose and as they are not made of
flesh and blood they could not be
harmed not one of your party could
escape them

  the light of the fire showed that the
indians looked at each other with mingled
incredulity and fear

  scrate gott muttered rattleton
is this browning i hear how did you
happen to think of such a bluff

  have to think in a case like this
returned the big fellow guardedly i
think only when it is absolutely neces-
sary this is one of those occasions
the indians got together and held a
consultation

  cant we make a run for it now
asked diamond eagerly

  we can nodded bruce but we
wont run far theyd be able to drop us
before we could get out of the light of
the fire 

  what can we do

  why well have to--

  browning was interrupted by a clatter
of hoofs which caused him to turn toward

the east the indians heard the sound
and they turned also

then wild yells of terror rent the air

chapter x

escape

  coming through the darkness at a mad
gallop was what seemed to be the gleam-
ing skeleton of a horse the ribs the
bones of the neck legs and head all
showed plainly glowing with a white
light

  and on the back of the horse which
had sheered to the north and was passing
the fire sat what seemed to be the skele-
ton of a human being the bones gleam-
ing the same as those of the horse

  it was almost astonishing and awe-
inspiring spectacle and it frightened the
indians greatly

  howugh-owugli-owugli wailed
black feather dismally

  then the savages dropped on their
faces covering their eyes so they could
not see the skeleton horseman

  almost at the same moment as the
horseman was passing the spot the
ghastly-appearing thing seemed to give a
sudden swing about and completely dis-
appear

  polylioker gasped rattleton its
gone

  thats right palpitated diamond-
vanished in a moment

  oh mah soul-mail soul wailed
toots dat sholy am de ol debbil his-
sef chilluns when we see it next its
gwan teh hab one ob us fu slio

  hark commanded browning

  the beat of the horses feet could be
distinctly heard but the creature had
turned about and was going back toward
the pass through the bluffs

  cliucker-chucker-chuck	cliucker-

chucker-chuck  cliucker-chucker-chuck 
came the ghostly sounds of the galloping
horse

  its turned about gasped harry in
astonishment

  its going fluttered jack

  and wed better be going too put
in browning

  then with a familiar whirring sound
something came flying toward them
through the darkness causing toots to
utter a wild shriek of terror


frank merriwell on the desert

   into the light of the camp fire flashed a
boy who was mounted on a bicycle and
they saw it was frank merriwell

  away he hissed as he flew past
them make straight for the pass by
which we entered this pocket i will join
you 

  then he was gone

  browning gave toots a sharp shake
fiercely whispering

  mount your wheel aiid keep with us
if you want to save your scalp if you
dont you will be left behind

  then the boys leaped upon their bicy-
cles and were away in a moment before
the prostrate indians had recovered from
the shock of terror given them by the ap-
pearance of the skeleton horse and rider

  for the time bruce browning took the
lead and the others followed him toots
had heeded the big fellows warning
words and he was not left behind

  barely had they passed beyond the
range of the firelight and disappeared in
the darkness when wild yells of anger
came from behind them and the knew
the indians had discovered they were
gone

  bend low bend low hissed dia-
mond they may take a fancy to shoot
after us stoop fellows

  stoop they did bending low over the
handle bars of their bicycles

  bang bang bang

  the indians fired several shots and
they heard some of the bullets whistle
past but they were not hit

  well thats what i call luck mut-
tered the young virginian

  what do you call luck asked rat-
tleton

   the appearance of that skeleton horse
and rider in time to scare the indians and
give us a chance to get away

  oh said harry sarcastically i
didnt know but it was merrys return i
told you he would not desert us

  i wonder how he happened to come
back just then 

  he came back because he was watch-
ing for an opportunity to help us and he
saw we had a splendid chance to get away
while the redskins were scared by the ap-
pearance of the horse and rider you
ought to know him well enough to know

-he is not the fellow to desert his friends
iu a scrape like this

   diamond was silent

  i wonder where frank is said
browning he said he would join us
and he is--

   right here old man  said a cheer-
ful voice as a flying bicycle brought
merriwell out of the darkness to brown-
ings side this way fellows well
hit the pass and get out of here as soon
as we can

  lawd bress yeh marser frank
cried toots joyfully i didnt knows
id see yeh no mo boy

  i hope you didnt think i had left
you for good

  no sar declared the colored boy
i done knows yeh better dan dat sar i
knowed yehd come back but i was
afeared yehd come back too late sar
deni injunses was gittin poerful anxious
fo dis yar wool ob mine-yes saj-
well i am glad to know you thought
i would not desert you i dont want any
of my friends to think i would go back
on them in the hour of need

   diamond was silent

   the pass was found without difficulty
and they went speeding through it

  how did you happen to turn up just
then frank asked harry

i was waiting for a chance to come to
you and i saw the chance when that
horse and rider frightened the indians
the horse and rider-where are
they asked browning

  gone through the pass ahead of us
mah gracious exclaimed the colored
boy what if dat ol debbil teks a
noshun teh wait fu us

   what sort of ghost business was it
anyway questioned rattleton it
seemed to be a skeleton horse and a
skeleton rider and it disappeared in a
twinkling i will admit this skeleton
business is beginning to work on my
nerves 

   it is rather creepish  laughed frank
but i do not think it is very dangerous 
all the same you do not attempt to
explain the mystery

  not now

  not now can you later

  perhaps so

   it is plain he knows no more about it
frank merriwell on the desert



than the rest of us said diamond as
for me i am getting sick of seeing
vanishing lakes and vanishing skeletons
if i get out of this part of the country
alive youll never catch me here again
meh too exclaimed toots

  well i dont know as any of us will
care to revisit it laughed frank
anyway we have been very lucky in
escaping from those indians that you
cant deny 

  you fooled them easily said rattle-
ton

  yes and they did not even take a
shot at me which was a surprise i ex-
pected they would pop away a few times
what are we going to do after we get
out on the open desert again asked
jack it seems to me well be as bad off
as ever  

  well have to go round the range to
the south or wait for the indians to get
away from that water hole so we can go
through the mountains as we originally
intended 

  the indians may not go away

  i rather think they have been scared
so theyll not hang round there long i
dont fancy theyll be anywhere in the
vicinity by morning

  if they are gone--

  well be all right providing we can
make our hard-bread and dried beef hold
out till we can reach one of the small
railroad towns

  how far away is the railroad

  not much over fifty miles

  that is easy declared rattleton
we can make it on a spurt

  as they reached the eastern opening of
the pass their attention was attracted by
a bright light that seemed to shine out
from the very niche where they had found
the jewel-decorated skeleton

chapter xi

gone 

  what does that mean exclaimed
jack in astonishment

  land ob warterinillions gasped
toots it am de debbils light fo suah
chilluns don yeh go near it

by jove cried frank that is
worth investigating come on fellows 
he headed straight toward the light

and as they came near the niche they saw
the bejewelled skeleton was again seated
as they had seen it in the first place and
a bright flood of light was shining upon
it from some mysterious place

  its back exclaimed harry in as-
tonishment

  sure enough  said frank it is on
deck again 

  i tells yeh to keep away from dat
skillerton shouted toots hit am
gwan teh grab yo this time if yo gits
near hit

  well take chances on that declared
frank this time we wont give it time
to get away but well go right up and
examine it 

thats what we will agreed harry
but even as he spoke the light disap-
peared and this made it impossible for
them to see anything up there in that
dark nook

  ha ha ha

  again they heard the mocking laugh-
ter smothered hollow and ghostly in
sound

  somebody is having lots of fun with
us said frank as he leaped from his
wheel it may be a good joke but i fail
to see where the ha ha comes in

  is the skeleton gone

	i dont know but ill mighty soon
find out

  without hesitation he swung himself
up to the niche in the rocks and rattle-
ton followed determined that frank
should not go alone into danger

  harry afterward confessed that he was
shivering all over when he climbed up
there in the darkness but his fear did not
keep him from sticking to merry

  a cry broke from franks lips

  what is it called browning from
below

by the eternal skies its gone again 
didnt i tole yeh cried toots from
a distance come erwav from dar
marser frank if yo don yo s gwan
teh be grabbed 

  it is gone agreed rattleton this
beats the old nick 

  again they heard that mocking laugh
which seemed to come down from some
point above their heads

  woobi shivered harry that
sounds pleasant


frank merriwell on the desert

  hang it all exclaimed frank in a
voice that indicated chagrin i dont
like to be made fun of this way if we
dont solve this mystery before we go
awav i shall always regret it

  beware

  it was the same voice that had uttered
the warning when they were riding into
the pass and now in the darkness of
night it sounded even more dismal and
uncanny than before

  come out and show yourself called
frank

  to this there was no answer

  for some time the boys remained there
but they were forced to abandon the task
of solving the mystery that night frank
descended to the ground with no small
reluctance and harry kept close to him
they mounted their wheels and rode
away once more fully expecting to hear
the mocking laughter or the ghostly voice
calling after them in this however
they were disappointed as nothing of the
kind happened

  after they had ridden some distance
frank proposed that they halt for the
night

  we are in for an open-air camp to-
night he said it is something we did
not expect but it cant be helped and as
the night is not cold i think we can get
along all right we need rest too
thats right agreed bruce i feel
as if i need about a week of steady rest-
ing but i dont care to take it here
how about the indians asked jack
we are not very far from them and
they might find us

  i scarcely think there is any danger
of that

  why not 

  those redskins were so badly fright-
ened that theyll not go hunting after
white boys to-night it is more likely
they will skin out and make for the
shoshone reservation on which they
must belong

  but what if they should happen to
follow us jack persisted

  we must take turns at standing guard
to-night and the guard should be able to
give us warning of danger in time for us
to mount our wheels and get away

  it was plain that diamond was not in

favor of stopping there but he said no
more

  fortunately the night was warm so
they suffered no discomfort by sleeping
thus no dew fell out there on the desert

  it was arranged that diamond should
stand guard first while frank came
second with toots for the last guard
toward morning

  they ate some of the hard bread and
jerked beef and then threw themselves
down with their bicycles near at hand
so they could spring up and mount in a
hurry if necessary

  browning was the first to stretch him-
self on the ground and he was snoring
almost immediately the others soon fell
asleep

  the rim of a round red moon was
showing away to the eastward when jack
awoke frank

how is it merriwell asked have
you heard or seen anything suspicious
not a thing was the reply all is
still as death out here-far too still i
dont like it 

  well it is not real jolly confessed
frank with a light laugh but i dont
think we need to be worried about
visitors and that is one good thing

   jack was fast asleep in a short time
morning came and toots was the first
to awaken dawn was breaking in the
east as he sat up rubbing his ees and
muttering

good land dat am de hardes spring
mattrus dis coon ebber snoozed on-yes
sar nebber struck nuffin lek dat befo
then he looked around in some sur-
prise

  gracious sakes he continued
whar am de hotel it done moved
away in de night an lef us

  it was some time befoie he realized
that they had not put tip at a hotel the
night before

  recktim dis is whar we stopped las
night he finally said i niembah
bout dat now we was ter tek turns
watchin i aint took no turn at all an
its mawnin he he he guess de
chap dat was ter wake me fell asleep his-
self an clean fergot it dat meks meli
bout so much sleep ahaid ob de game
he was feeling good over this when he
noticed that three forms were stretched
frank merriwell on the desert



on the ground near at hand instead of
four

  wliar am de odder one he mut-
tered one ob dem boys am gone fo
suali land ob warterniillions what do
hit mean dar am dimunan dar am
rattletum an dar am brownin but
wliar-wliar am marser frank

  in a moment lie was filled with alarm
and he lost no time in grasping harrys
shoulder and giving it a shake while he
cried 

  wek up heah yo sleepy haid-wek
up i tells yeh dars suffin wrong heah
ur s a fool nigger

  muts tlie whatter mumbled rattle-
ton sleepily cant you let a fellow

  eh grunted harry starting up and
rubbing his eyes why the moon is just
rising 

  moon snorted the colored boy
dats de sun coinin up an i dont
beliehe yo took yoah turn keepin

  browning grunted and rolled over
flinging out one arm and giving toots a
crack on the neck that keeled him over
on the ground

  landy goodness squealed the
darkey grasping his neck witli both
hands what vo tryin ter do boy
want ter kill a po coon nebber seen

sitting up and staring around

  but nobody roused me declared
rattleton

  nor me asserted browning

  git up chilluns-git up squealed
toots excitedly wes gotter find dat
boy in a hurry spect lies in a berry
bad scrape

chapter xii

the mystery explained

  by this time the boys were fully
aroused an investigation showed that
merriwells wheel was gone

   didnt i tole yeh old debbil skillerton
would done cotch some ob us cried
toots in great distress

  i hardly understand what the skele-
ton could have wanted with merrys
wheel observed browning

  gway dar boy didn de skillerton
ride a hawse

  and you think it is an up-to-date
skeleton that has decided to ride a bicycle
hereafter in that case i congratulate
mr skeleton on his good sense

  it must be that frank has gone on a
ride without saying anything to us said
jack i do not see any other way of
explaining it 

  but why should he do such a thing
asked rattleton

  that is where you stick me

  browning slowly shook his head

  it is remarkable that he should do
such a thing without saying anything to
us  declared the big fellow

  and he must have taken that ride in
the night said jack

  while he should have been 
guaid added harry

  the boys stood looking at each other
in sober dismay

  it isnt possible that merry could
have gone daffy muttered rattleton
he is too well balanced for that

  i dont know came gloomily from
diamond this dismal burning desert
is enough to turn the brain of any
fellow  

  yah cried toots don yeh git
 noshun dat boy ebber had his brain
turned  it am de weak brains dat git
turned dat way his brain was all right
but i jes know fo suali dat he hab been
cotched 


frank merriwell on the desert

  and i suppose you want to nun away
as soon as possible before you are
cotched 

  then the colored boy surprised them
all by saying

  no sar  don want teh go way till
we knows what hab become ob marser
frank dat boy alwus stick by his
friens an dis coon am reddv teh stick
by him even if he do git cotched

  good stuff toots cried rattleton
approvingly you are all right if any-
thing lias happened to frank well know
what it is or leave our bones here

  the boys were worried they hurriedly
talked over the remarkable disappearance
trying to arrive at an understanding of its
meaning

  at length it was agreed that frank
might have gone back to try to solve the
mystery of the skeleton and then they
decided that two of the party should re-
main where they had made their night
bivouac while the other two proceeded to
search for merriwell

  diamond insisted on being one of the
searchers and rattleton was determined
to be the other so browning and toots
were left behind

  the boys mounted their wheels and
rode back toward the pass through the
bluffs

  diamond was downcast again
everything is going against us he
declared there is fate in it i am
afraid well not get out of this wretched
desert 

  oh youre unwell thats whats the
matter with you declared harry
scornfully ill be glad when you are
yourself again 

  thats all right muttered diamond
you are too thoughtless thats whats
the matter with you

  they approached the spot where the
mysterious skeleton had been seen and
both were watching for the niche in the
rocks

  suddenly they were startled by hearing
a wild cry from far above their heads and
looking upward they saw frank merri-
well running along the very brink of the
cliff but limping badly as if he were
lame

  but what astonished and startled them

the most was to see a strange-looking
bare-headed man who was in close pur-
suit of frank above his head the man
wildly flourished a gleaming long-bladed
knife while he uttered loud cries of rage

  smooly hoke cried harry will
you look at that

  diamond suddenly grew intensely ex-
cited

 what can we do-what can we
do he exclaimed frank is hurt that
creature is running him down he will
murder him

  if merry had a pistol he would be all
right 

  but he hasnt we must do some-
thing harry-we must

  neither of us has a gun

 no but--

  we cant get up there

  but we must do something

  we cant

  jack grew more and more frantic he
leaped from his wheel and seemed to be
looking for some place to try to scale the
face of the bluff

  oh if i could get up there he
groaned id show frank that i was
ready to stand by him id fight that
man bare handed

  and rattleton did not doubt it for he
well knew how hot-blooded diamond
was and the young virginian had never
failed to fight when the occasion arose
he would not shirk any kind of an en-
counter

  merriwell saw them and shotited some-
thing to them but they could not under-
stand what he said

  turn turn  screamed jack you
must fight that man or he will stab you
in the back  he is going to strike you 
frank seemed to hear and comprehend
for he suddenly wheeled about and made
a stand in a moment the man with the
knife had rushed upon him and struck
with that gleaming blade

  a groan escaped jacks lips as he saw
that blow but it turned to a gasp of relief
when frank stopped it by catching the
mans wrist

  give it to him give it to him
shrieked diamond dancing around in a
wild frenzy of anxiety and fear

  then the boys below witnessed a terrific
struggle on the heights above them
frank merriwell on the desert



  the man seemed mad -with a desire to
plunge the knife into frank and it was
plain that merriwell did not wish to harm
the unknown but was trying to disarm
him

  what folly what folly panted
diamond hell get his hand free and
stab merry sore beat him down frank
-beat him down

  once frank slipped and fell to his
knees a fierce yell of triumph broke
from the man and it seemed that he
would succeed in using the knife at last

  with a groan of anguish diamond
covered his eyes that he might not wit-
ness the death of the friend he loved
for jack diamond did love frank merri-
well for all that he had complained
against him of late

  a cry of relief from rattleton caused
jack to look again and he saw frank
had regained his feet and was continuing
the battle

  and now the man fought with a fury
that was nerve thrilling to witness his
movements were swift and savage and he
tried again and again to draw the knife
across franks throat

  jack and harry scarcely breathed until
with a display of strength and skill
frank disarmed his assailant by giving
his arm a wrench causing the knife to fly
through the air and fall over the edge of
the cliff

  down to the ground below rattled the
knife and then diamond said 

  now frank will be able to handle the
fellow 

  but flinging his arms about the boy
the man made a mad effort to spring over
the brink for some seconds locked
thus in each others arms man and boy
tottered on the very verge and then they
swayed back

  frank broke the hold of the man
striking him a heavy blow a second later
the man reeled and dropped on the edge
of the precipice he scrambled up hastily
but a great slice of rock cleaved off be-
neath his feet and went plunging down-
ward

  then the watching boys saw the un-
known tottering on the brink wildly
waving his arms in an endeavor to regain
his balance frank sprang forward to aid
him

   too late

   with a wild scream of despair the
strange man toppled over and whirled
downward to his death

   its all up with him poor fellow
said frank merriwell as he stood near
the body of the unknown man looking
down at the face that was white and calm
and peaceful in death

   frank had disappeared from the top of
the bluff while jack and harry were
bending over the fallen man and had re-
appeared nearly twenty minutes later by
swinging down from the niche in which
the mysterious skeleton had been seen

   who is he asked harry

   what is he asked jack

   i am afraid those questions cannot be
answered confessed frank that he
was a raving maniac i am sure and he
lived in a remarkable cave close at hand
but who he is or how he came to be there
in that cave i do not know

   well how you came to be up there
with him running you down to stick a
knife in you is what i want to know
said harry

  thats right jack nodded ex-
plain it old man 

   then frank told them how after the
moon rose the night before he had taken
his wheel with the intention of riding
around the camp feeling he could- keep
watch as well that way as an- after the
moon was well up he saw there was no
one anywhere about and a desire to re-
visit the spot where they had seen the
skeleton seized upon him he rode to the
spot but there was no skeleton in the
niche among the rocks leaving his
bicycle he climbed up there to examine
once more and to his astonishment
found that what seemed to be a solid
immovable stone had turned in some
manner disclosing an opening

   then with reckless curiosity frank
resolved to investigate further and he de-
scended into the opening found some
stone steps and was soon in a cavern
the first thing he discovered was the
skeleton still decorated as the boys had
seen it in the first place and he remained
there till he found how it could be placed
i in view on the block of stonee and then


frank merriwell on the desert

removed in a twinkling he also found
a lamp with a strong reflector which had
thrown its light on the skeleton from a
hole in the rocks there was another
opening near that where a person in the
cave could look out on the desert and
frank knew the ghostly voice they had
heard must have come from that place

  merriwell continued his investigations
having lighted the lamp by the light of
which he wandered through the cave
suddenly he came face to face with an
old man who seemed surprised but spoke
quietly to him

  the old man declared he was pro-
fessor morris fillmore but did not say
what he was professor of and he volun-
teered to explain everything to the boy

  this he did telling how he worked the
skeleton to frighten away those who
might molest him in his solitude as he
wished to be alone there was another
entrance to the cave and in a large airy
chamber a horse was kept the horse
was coal black but on one side of him
was drawn the outlines of the skeleton
frame of a horse and the strange old man
explained that he had a suit of clothes on
one side of which he had traced the
skeleton of a human being this had
been done with phosphorus and it glowed
with a white light in the darkness

  the old hermit had entered the pocket
and ridden near the camp of the indians
when he turned about the skeleton trac-
ings in phosphorus could not be seen and
so the ghostly horse and rider seemed to
disappear in a most marvelous manner

  frank questioned him concerning the
treasure and the man seemed to grow
excited and suspicious he said some-
thing about the treasure being the prop-
erty of some one who had fled from the
destroying angels of the mormons in the
old days but had perished in the desert
frank was led to believe that the skeleton
was that of the original owner of the
treasure

  but when the boy would have left the

cave the strange man told him he could
not do so he informed frank that he
could never go out again and then it was
that the boy became sure fillmore was
crazy

  as the man was armed frank decided
to use strategy first he sought to lull
the mans suspicions and after being
watched closely for hours he found a
chance to slip away

  almost immediately the man discovered
what had happened and pursued by
chance frank fled out through a passage
that led upward till the top of the bluff
was reached but he fell and sprained his
ankle so he was unable to get away
the hermit followed and the mad battle
for life took place

  well this is amazing gasped jack
what are you going to do with that
treasure

  take it to some place for safe deposit
and advertise for the legal heirs of pro-
fessor millard fillmore

  and if no heirs appear--

  the treasure will belong to us

  franks plan was carried out all the
treasure was removed from the cavern in
which the mysterious old hermit was
buried the hermits horse was set free
and the boys carried the treasure to tjllin
nevada where it was shipped to carson
and deposited in a bank there

  if it is not claimed in a years time
boys said frank we will go about the
work of having it evenly divided among
us in that case we will have made a
good thing out of this trip across the
continent

  hooray fo us shouted toots

bingo

  bingo was a dog

  bingo was exceedingly black eyes skin hair every-
  thing about bingo except
  the sad fate	liis disposition was of the

most sombre hue he had

          ot a

the most charming qualities
firemans dog as an offset to his funereal
coloring he was intelli-
gent he was kiud he was unselfish he was faithful
and he was devoted to his vocation

  both his parents were french so according to the
law of canine genealog bingo was a french poodle

  bingo came into the possession of a fireman when he
was a very young and utterly ignorant little poodle the
puppy was trained with the greatest care and bingo
became a fire-dog

  a fire-dog is one which lives in a fire-station and
takes an active interest in conflagrations

  the fireman taught biugo many tricks and accom-
plishments but w here fives were concerned the dog
picked up everything by himself in this particular
station the horses are kept in stalls close to the engine
everything is arranged so that there will be no delay
iu starting off for the fire the moment the alarm is
souuded the harness hangs from the ceiling high
enough from the ground to allow the horses to come
under it

  the moment the alarm sounds the horses start with
the greatest alacrity trot to the engine ami put them-
selves iu position to lie harnessed by the time they are
thei-e the firemen are sliding down the smooth round
pole which goes from the ground floor of the engine-
house up to the room wheie they sleep

  the harness is dropped on the horses the buckles
made fast iu a jiffy  he driver vaults into his seat
and iu a moment more the engine is galloping full tilt
through the busy streets the liremen hoarsely shouting
to warn vehicles aud pedestrians to get out of the way
it is a most exciting sight to see the horses bounding
along the heavy engine rattling and saying over the
stones

  biugo soon determined what his function was and he
acquitted himself of it with the most ardent zeal this
of course was after he had grown up and had reached
maturity when he was a wabbly little puppy and
when later he was a thoughtless giddy young dog he
did not go to gres but was fed and trained upstairs

  but he grew to be very strong although be was
never veiy large his hair was clipped so that ho
looked somewhat like an african lion it was cut very
close in daces but was left thick around his shoulders
and head with a tuft on ihe end of his tail he had
little armlets of his own hair on his legs and a little
clump on his houclies

  his black shiny eyes glistened from beneath the silky
hair that hung over them and he looked so keen and
quick that oue felt obliged to be very clear and precise
with him because he had the air of not being able to
lose any time in foolishness

  bang bang bang would go the gong the horses
would come clattering forward trampling the floor
with their sounding hoofs and at the same moment
bingos cheery bark was heart i as he scurried iiouml
in mad anxiety to get everybody oil all light to put
out the fire oh how important he felt when thealarm
was given and he felt called pn to contribute to the good
of the community by his generous efforts

  after the engine hail started out he tore along ahead
of it turning round now anil then to see that it was
following and dodging around among the feet of the
horses and the vans that h met he barked all this
time with a tremendors sense of his importance as if
proclaiming clear the way good folk  i tear the
way there is a fire and we are in a hurry to put it
out

binfro used to follow the men who went into the
burning building and would frequently make his way

	the roof it was his chief delight to get near the fire-
man who was directing the stream upon the fire

  when the are as out he trotted back with the proud-
est air of complacency and upon returning to tue en-
gine-house lie would frisk among the burly firemen as
if courting attention and praise for his services

  oue cold bright night in december the fire-alarm
sounded the horses sprang to the engine there was
the rush of firemen but there occurred for some reason
or other a moments delay hingo was skipping around
iu great distress of mintl at this hindrauce there was
that fire limning and where was lie

  as soon as the doori were opened be charged madly
forwartl some oue was in his way however and in
dodging him he hung himself against a door-post the
shock as so great that he was thrown bick anti fell
under the hoofs of the horses as they charged out a
heavy hoof with its iron shoe crushed down upon his
side

  poor bingo when the engine had passed over him
he feebly and painfully dragged himself toward one of
the stalls for the horses he was tauting ami once or
twice he uttered a feeble whine there was not one of
those he loved most near at hand to comfort him they
were at the fire he would never go to a ire agalu
he raised his head and looked arouud the faimliar sta-
tion with a sigh then his head fell heavily to the
ground aud bingo was dead

punishing an elephant

  some elephants resemble men in their liability to sud-
den outbursts of passion aud in their exhibition of re-
morse when the passion having subsided they see the
results of their violent temper an illustration of an
elephants violence and coutrition is given by the au-
thor of rough kotes of an ld soldier

  while the party was in camp a mahout went with
his elephant to cut forage as he was binding it in
bundles the elephant began to help himself and
knocked about the bundles already tied up

  the mahout punished the beast for his disobedience
by a blow on the shins which so enraged the elephant
that he seized the man with his trunk dashed him to
the ground and trampled him to death

  no sooner had he killed his keeper than he repented
roared and bolted for the jungle to bide himself six
other elephants guided by their mahouts followed
him on being driven into a corner he surrendered
ami was led into camp a prisoner aud chains were
plac d on his legs

  then came his punishment an elephant was placed
on either side each holding a heavy iron chain as
the deatl body of the mahout was laid on the grass be-
fore him the elephant roared loudly being perfectly
aware of what he had done

  a mahout ordered the two elephants to punish the
murderer iifting the two heavy chains high in the
nir with their trunks they whipped him with these
iron whips until he made the camp echo with his roars
of pain he was then picketed by himself and an iron
chain attached to his hind leg which he dragged after
him on the march

sports and pastimes

bicycle training

   it is advisable before conmienciug to train says
 zimmerman to consult a physician and to be care-
 fully examined to see tliat you
 hints from	are thoroughly sound if you

 three experts are  would be folly for
 you to begin lie careful as
 to diet retire early and abstain from smoking
 and alcoholic dri-iks smoking depresses the heart
 and shortens the wind while drinking strains the blood

 i	have beaten many a man who would have had a far
 better chance and perhaps beaten me if he could have
 let liquor alone

   i do not train or ride duringthe winter but take a
 complete rest lu my opinion this is a better course
 for the american rider to pursue than to attempt to
 keep in condition all the winter

hoad training

   most men should commence training on the road at
 least a month before the first race but i take a much
 longer time to get lit my consolation is that i keep in
 form longer than usual generally right through the
 season this preliminary road riding like everything
 connected with training must be done in a systematic
 manner the morning exercise should be taken from
 one and a half to two hours after breakfast i do not
 believe in taking any exercise before breakfast as some
 advise i have tried it but it was not a success it
 seemed to me like trying to run an engine w ithout fuel
 one and a half or two hours after breakfast ride from
 eight to ten miles on the road

   train for the distance which after experience you
 find the best adapted to your capabilities some men
 have the power to stay long distances at a moderate
 pace but cannot sprint at all w hile others can do just
 the opposite a very few can do both

won in the last quarter

   when you have found out the distance which suits
 you best try it about once a week let some one hold a
 watch on you and time each quarter of a mile at
 each succeeding attempt try to improve the previous
 quarter a little but hold enough in reserve to ride the
 last quarter the fastest

   laurens meintjes says

   i begin to prepare for the racing seasou in the
 spring my preliminary consists of a teu-niile spin
 about ten oclock am i ride at a slow but steady
 pace after i have finished i get a good rub down and
 rest quietly for a cop pie of hours when i enjoy a two-
 mile walk at an ordinary gait coming back to my
 training quarters  again mount my machine and reel
 off about twenty miles goiug free and easy

   the early part of my ride is confined to slow pace
 which i gradually increase and finish with a sprint at
 top speed this work i continue for another month
 -when  begin to sprint quarters and halves having
 satisfied myself that i am thoroughly fit that my wind
 is good and  am willing to wind up with a strong
 sprint i start for the race meets after that the work
 you get in your race will be quite enough to keep you
 on edge provided you diet yourself i eat everything
 and anything i like except pastry i never use liquors
 but am an inveterate smoker

walter sangers advice

   walter sanger says

   before doing any work at all the stomach must be
 got into shape by a thorough physicking which re-
 lieves the system of all biliousness this leaves the
 body in a very weak condition ami it must be strength-
 ened gradually by keeping very quiet and eating light
 food such as milk toast soft boiled egijs etc for a
 few days after which more strengthening food may be
 taken

   the first three days very little exercise is sufficient
 -three to six miles a day at about a  to - gait
 this should be gradually worked down day by day
 until at the end of a few weeks the pace is brought
 down to about  th third week will show a more
 rapid chatge iu the condition of the man the miles
 will be rolled off at about a  to  clip and the
 distance by this time will be lengthened to about nine
 miles each day

  a little faster work may now be indulged in and
half a mile can be reeled off at about a one-minute clip
paced to show the condition of the man in regard to
endurance if he is found wanting he must aain re-
turn to plugging but if he has the required endur-
ance he may start to sprint a short distance

  it is at this point that the trainer should get in his
fine work turning the superfluous flesh into muscle
after each work-out the man should have a thorough
drying with coarse towels followed by a most thorough
massage every muscle being worked and manipu-
lated

a wonderful bicycle palace

  one of the most striking features of the paris exhibi-
tion of  is going to be so it is said a most remark-
able bicycle palace to be designed and built espec-
ially to do houor to the wheel it will be used for the
display of the cycle in all its forms from the first
crude two-wheeled walking machine to the delicate
mechanism of the present day

  the exact dimensions of the structure have not yet
been decided upon but the plans provide accommoda-
tion for sever thousand persons on the ground floor

  the ground surrounding it will be circular with
paths like spokes leading to the common centre all
the windows are likewise to be circular with spoke
frames and w ith a small round colored pane iu the mid-
dle to indicate the hub

  the main entrance will be entirely of marble cut in
the form of immense bicycle forks while overhead will
rest a huge handle bar of burnished steel a number
of smaller rooms will lead off from the main floor sep-
arated only by festooned curtains made entirely ot such
netting as is usually employed on ladies bicycles

  at either end of the main floor will be a monster
wheel with illuminated tires these wheels will re-
volve front the opening to the closing of the exhibition
apart from the light produced in this manner the
only illumination will be large bicycle lamps eery
seat in the building will be made of parts of bicycles
though many of them will be so arranged as to be far
more comfortable than qven the very latest novelties in
saddles curved and straight handle bars will be used
for backs and cushioned wheels in some cases for seats
while the chairs will be held up by different parts of
the frame

  the exhibits will be guarded from the visitors curi-
ous touch by a series of cycle chains and the lectur-
eis of whom there will be a plentiful supply will
travel about the building on wheels

  refreshments will be served by a busy corps of cy-
clist attendants mounted on bicycles and it is promised
that the manner in which they will conduct their evo-
lutions will be truly remarkable

  each pillar of the building vi ill he decorated with
cycle chains and surrounded at short distances by tires
even the floor will represent the wheel circular tiles
are to be inlaid with spokes ami the triangles formed
by the meeting of every thiee circles will be filled by
tiles representing small cycle frames there will of
course be a lively jingle of bicycle bells this being
the ouly form of signaling allowed in the building

  all tiie doors are to be locked at night with bicycle
locks and a number of special gendarmes will patrol
the grounds on wheels

  every seat in tiie building will he pneumatic and
be supplied with a bell the main floor is of course to
be kept clear for the public performances and contests
there will be only one exhibit in the centre of the
room this will consist of a number of the vei latest
inventions in the bicycle world the whole to be sur-
rounded by a monster electric unicycle the inxention
of a parisian electrician this feature however may
be changed iu case a more advanced invention is re-
ceived

  the roof of the building will be festooned the gird-
ers being made of steel with every conceivable part of
a bicycle woven into the designs orders have already
been placed in england for the manufacture of all the
pottery to be used in the building every piece will be
made bicycle fashion cups saucers plates- in fact
even the forks used will represent the wheel having
only two prongs and being made in the manner of bi-
cycle forks
