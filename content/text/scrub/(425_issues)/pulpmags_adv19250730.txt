will have some idea of the number of persons
who perished last year in the united states from
drowning accidents more than  drowned

knowing the depth or what
lies beneath the surface-
who swims far out disre-
garding unknown currents
undertow and cramps

learn to swim-not alone
because swimming is joyous
recreation and splendid exer-
cise-but so that you can
save your own life and the
lives of others if called upon
swimming is not at all a dif-
ficult accomplishment once
learned it cannot be forgot
ten good instructors may
be found almost every
where it is of highest
importance to be well taught

your chance to save a life

day after day all through the summer you read
the tragic story of death by drowning some one
dares a beginner to swim out to the raft or
perhaps the water is too rough even the
strongest swimmers take unnecessary chances
go ahead be a sport has brought disaster to
thousands

dont be a sport-be a sportsman

there is a vast difference between a sport and
a sportsman the sportsman is courageous and
willingly hazards his life for others-but he is
not a daredevil

the sport showily daring is the one who does
stunts to dazzle onlookers-who dives without

there is one thing that everybody young and old
should know how to do-revive the apparently
drowned often they are not dead	 

though life seems to be extinct pa-   s
tient persistent manipulation of the	 

right kind would bring them back to
consciousness it is heartbreaking
to think of the lives that could have
been saved if some one in the crowd
standing paralyzed with horror had
but known the simple manipulations
necessary to rekindle the vital spark

this summer be prepared never
court danger but be ready to meet
the great hazard that sometimes
lurks in water sports

  during the months of july august and septem-

  except heart disease and tuberculosis-among the
   policyholders in the metropolitan
  life insurance company deaths from drowning
  are at their height during these months

  in july  the number of deaths among metro-
  politan policyholders from drowning was about
  twice as many a from typhoid fever and diph-
  theria together

  it is the duty of parents to have their children
  instructed in swimming and the art of resus-
  citation so that the danger from drowning at-

 tending summer vacations may be minimized
 the metropolitan has prepared a booklet  arti-
 ficial respiration  which shows by diagrams just
 how to restore breathing by manipulation of the
 apparently drowned body as well as what to do
 in the case of gas suffocation or electric shock
 carbon monoxide poisoning claims an increasing
 number of victims each year because it is not

christianity
on broadway

excerpts from editorial in
the daily reporter white plains n y
by iv livingston lamed

an unusual project has been
 set in motion in new york a
business building is to rise on
broadway at rd street dedi-
cated to christianity to be known
as the broadway temple it will
contain a church offices auditori-
ums schools hotel accommodations
cafeterias etc and to a large ex-
tent it will be erected by popular
subscription individuals buy bonds
representing a  per cent invest-
ment and the total cost will be ap-
proximately 

   it is the first undertaking of its kind and
has so many amazing features that we will
do well to observe some of these innovations
for this is a combination of church and sky
scraper business and christianity will be
housed under one roof

this broadway temple is in a sense a
gigantic symbol of the uncontrovertible fact
that godliness can and should be continuous

   broadway will be the better for a substan-
tial reminder of this holy presence from
e vqry vantage point on sunny days or nights
filled with the sinister menace of storm a
high-flung cross of unquenchable light will
be visible glittering against the heavens
and he will murmur to himself reverently
the holy spirit bides with me wherever
i may be walking or sleeping

  broadway temple will cover 
square feet of foundation space facing a
whole block on broadway it will have a
beautiful tower  stories high six million
people will see a revolving cross of light
 feet high on its topmost pinnacle the
church auditorium will seat  there will
be sunday school rooms a social hall and
every modern convenience for religious and
community work an apartment hotel in the
tower is to contain  rooms public offices
and dining halls apartments for house-
keeping in the two wings will accommodate
 persons and there are stores fronting
on broadway

   in exploiting this magnificent and ambi-
tious plan its sponsors say a - per cent
investment in your fellow mans salvation
broadway temple is to be a combination of
church and skyscraper religion and rev-
enue salvation and  per cent-and the 
per cent is based on ethical christian
grounds

   broadway temple is more than a revolu-
tionary idea more than a sound investment
more than an architectural wonder of the
age it represents a spiritual stepping-stone
in man s climb upward to the cross

trcbuy these bonds
and let god
come to broadway

our eight-year-old girl would lose weeks of school work
besides being incapacitated while she was in school from
attacks of stomach trouble i decided to give fleischmanns
yeast a trial i began with half a cake mixed with peanut
butter on bread and then i served it in many different ways
my child has never had another attack of stomach trouble
since i gave her yeast yeast is just as good for children as
for grown-ups	mrs g a viele costa mesa cal

after i gave birth to my child i felt very much run
down i had constant trouble with my stomach and what
troubled me most-i suffered from terrible sties finally an
eye specialist prescribed fleischmanns yeast in two months
there wasnt a trace left of the sties my complexion improved
wonderfully i no longer have an aversion for food and i
manage to keep and look young with the help of fleischmanns
yeast	mrs sarah steinhardt new york city

what everybody knows

the danger of clogged intestines
the evils of digestive troubles
and disfiguring skin eruptions
the tragedy of lowered vitality

not a cure-all not a
medicine in any sense-
fleischmanns yeast is simply a
remarkable fresh food

  the millions of tiny active yeast
plants in every cake invigorate
the whole system they aid di-
gestion-clear the skin-banish
the poisons of constipation where
cathartics give only temporary
relief yeast strengthens the intes-
tinal muscles and makes them
healthy and active and day by
day it releases new stores of energy

  all grocers have fleischmanns
yeast start eating it today buy
several cakes at a time-they will

keep fresh in a cool dry place for

 nother specimen with pro-
 nounced facial asymmetry
 the doctor said the nose
 deviates the jaw is bestial

any scars

  seated before the table were two military
doctors a captain and a lieutenant the
captain nearing fifty graying beard gold-
rimmed spectacles did most of the talking

  the man in question stood before them
naked his face was sinister and in spite
of the powerful muscles on his long limbs
the pasty pallor of his face made him appear
ill a tattoo mark spread on his chest
blurred indistinct as if the needle had been
used to erase a previous handiwork

  saying whats wrong with my face wont
help me doctor he said aggressively

  if i had told the lieutenant that you
showed symptoms of liver trouble sug-

gested the officer patiently you would not
be angry youre no more to blame for
your face than for your liver we note
your characteristics see the way you react
and learn some time it may help us save
some other poor fellow

  im a sort of human guinea-pig then
im on to your bluff you get paid for
this thats all you worry about

  a word of advice- the doctor re-
sumed you see the stripes on my coat
i happen to be first a doctor then an officer
therefore i understand you mean no harm
but usually it is foolish to speak defiantly

we cant change the ways of humanity over
night

  he shrugged wearily helpless before the
misery of the world seeping into his in-
spection room

  next he called sharply

  as if in a dream edmond chaptel moved
forward

  he was aware of his comrades lolling
against the walls of the room in various
stages of undress exchanging guarded words
occasionally and of the sergeant in charge
standing by the open door the kepi was
clamped solidly on his small head secured
by the narrow chin-strap circling the mas-
sive jaws

  he was a machine a cog without personal
feelings his walk was mechanical on
the way from the depot chaptel had been
fascinated by the regular steps and by the
precision of his voice a voice that tolled off
orders as a clock ticks off seconds he was
the personification of the military grind the
grind that had seized chaptel for two
years perhaps longer if the tales he had
heard were true

  at the age of twenty-one frenchmen are
called to the colors every year among
the thousands called for duty there exists a
small proportion of young men who have al-
ready served terms in prison to mix them
with the sound normal elements that form
the home regiments would prove unwise
special units perforce were created to re-
ceive them the african battalions of
light infantry the bataillons dinfanterie
legere d afrique the famous bat daf
garrisoned in north africa

  chaptel had just arrived to join the xst
battalion in ain saffra this meant that
he had served before his twenty-first birth-
day at least six months in prison yet
there was nothing of the conventional
prisoner about him he himself knew that
he had shaken off the effects of his half-year
sojourn within walls knew that he had re-
acted against environment and was as
sound mentally and morally as he had ever
been but the law is the law and knows no
exception

  he had joined his present comrades in
lyons two days three days more than a
week he had been with them yet they
kept him out of their conversations out of
their lives feeling evidently that although
with them he was not one of their kind
queer fellows a collection of nightmare faces

men who spoke a slang foreign to him pro-
truding jaws low foreheads thick lips that
twisted thin lips that sneered-and eyes
that did not meet the glance squarely

  in the train from lyons to marseilles
and on the boat that carried them from
france to algeria across the mediterranean
chaptel had attempted to make friends or
at least a friend this was his first long
voyage his first adventure into far coun-
tries and sentiments surged within him for
expression once impressed by the mag-
nificence of sea and sky by the unusual
warmth of the air by the glow of the more
powerful sun he had remarked to the near-
est man concerning the peculiar sensations
all this aroused in him something also of
hope for the future the other had looked
upon him in bewilderment had shrugged
and walked away

  the voice of the captain broke through
his reverie a curt reminder that the inspec-
tion room was no place for musing

   he answered questions as to his name age
place of birth was measured and weighed
after these preliminaries the doctor thumped
his chest examined his teeth his eyes

  no trace of degeneracy no tattoo
marks he dictated then commented
unusual specimen a case in a thousand
doesnt belong here

  mutely chaptel agreed with him
  criminal record the doctor questioned
  six months in prison

  stealing

   chaptel flushed

  no doctor

  women

  no doctor

  what did you do

  struck a gendarme he lost an eye
the men on the benches overheard and
laughed one or two yelled in mock ap-
plause

  the sergeant by the door opened his
mouth and a command hurtled like a
bullet-

   still

  you seem a good sort of a fellow the
doctor declared this will be only a pass-
ing trial for you dont allow yourself to
sink im noting your name with good
conduct you will be allowed to enter a regu-
lar regiment at the end of eight months
thank you doctor

  get dressed

  back to his place on the bench chaptel
knaves of spades



dressed leisurely for the first time he
felt hopeful the doctor evidently meant
what he said and eight months was not
an eternity

  i knifed a cop myself boasted the
youth next to him but i didnt get
caught they pinched me breaking into a
store one night

  chaptel was spared further details the
vigilant sergeant invited the young man to
silence

  when the last of the men had been ex-
amined they glanced expectantly at the
sergeant wondering what was to happen
next then a fellow whom chaptel had
never seen before came out and stood be-
tween the two doctors

he was of average height but
he was broad his arms were enor-
mous his back muscles swelled
abnormally his legs were aston-
ishingly slender for a man of his bulk wiry
covered with hair tattooed across his back
appeared a crudely executed drawing an
army officer in full uniform crucified above
the head the legend stood out in bold let-
ters mort aux vaches death to cows
the battle cry of the paris apache just as
every member of detective and police forces
in america is a bull he is branded a cow
in france why the feminine greater del-
icacy of language who knows

  the newcomer saluted the doctors re-
spectfully

  ive seen you before whats your
name

  achille duval yes you saw me be-
fore doctor you have a sacred good
memory im the man who served five
years in the penitentiary for assaulting a
sergeant

  i remember you got a new tattoo eh
you think that drawing on your back artis-
tic pretty

  not at all doctor i told the fool who
did it to give me something distinguished
out of the ordinary thats what i got
its too big to disguise aint it

  duval glanced quickly about the room
when the black eyes struck his own glance
chaptel felt a sort of shock in the pit of the
stomach

  duval was attractive and at the same
time repellent he was not good looking
in the strictest sense of the word his nose
was too broad the jaws too powerful but

he was beautiful as an animal is beautiful
with the suggestion of intense physical
strength of immense possibilities for love
and hatred his eyebrows thick and dark

almost met across his face and only a nar-
row strip of forehead showed between them
and the crisp black hair hair that was still
bristling newly grown on his shaven head

  youve come back here to finish your
term you have only three months to
serve the doctor went on you better
than any one else know what the military
penitentiary is like you dont want to get
back there keep yourself in hand duval
and dont seek quarrels with non-coms
duval half turned and glared at the
sergeant his teeth bared in a sort of grin

  its hard to hold in doctor he said
loudly most of them treat us like dogs
this sergeant for instance i remember
him his nose deviates his jaws are strong
as a bulldogs he should be with us not
over us

thats no way to start out the doctor
admonished youll offend the sergeant
no doctor the non-com offered with-
out moving from his post what that scum
says dont touch me any

  but chaptel who was watching him
closely saw the blood ebb from his neck
gradually and his tiny eyes followed duval

  forget it sergeant ordered the doctor
duval was joking the hospital is not the
barrack-yard and whats said here doesnt
concern the outside

  he gathered his papers and signified to
the sergeant that he could clear the room

  fixe get out into the yard all of you
the non-com ordered

  he stood aside and allowed them to pass
out one by one

get in ranks according to height
chaptel found himself next to duval
the man from the penitentiary had assumed
an expression of extreme innocence and
placidly returned the stare of the sergeant

  stay here ordered the latter ill be
back soon 

  he walked away through the shimmering
light of the yard to a small building at the
far end of the esplanade evidently the can-
teen leaving the men in the sun

  chaptel glanced to right and left the
faces were far from prepossessing at best
as the uniforms had not yet been issued
all were in civilian clothing ranging from
well-cut broadcloth suits to overalls the


adventure

headgears comprised every known style of
hat and cap the shoes were as varied
from elastic tops to cord-soled sandals worn
by those of the men recently released from
prison duval wore the brown garments of
the penitentiary with a large number in
black stitched over the left breast

  several men in uniform members of the
battalion had come close to inspect their
new comrades with many caustic remarks

on their appearance and foul references to
their morals and behavior one or two of
them recognized duval and greeted him
without much show of cordiality

  feeling that he had the good fortune to be
next to a man of experience chaptel ques-
tioned the ex-convict

  what do we do next why do we wait
here

  duval did not turn his head but spoke
from the corner of the mouth nearest
chaptel with scarcely a movement of his
face

  the major commanding will make a lit-
tle speech then the uniforms will be
issued

  when do we eat

  at five

  good food

  not for you for me yes ive starved
so often in the hills that anything tastes
good

  you mean they starve you up there
  shut up here he comes

  the sergeant was coming back ac-

  companied by two other non-coms his
  face had resumed its usual pigmentation
  perhaps he was a trifle redder on the cheek
  bones the impersonal manner he had
  shown in the hospital-room was gone he
  halted five paces from the line examined
  each man in turn slowly from head to foot
  chaptel understood he was asserting his
  hold over them same old trick played by
  prison-keepers and gendarmes staring a
  man out of countenance when his own
  turn came he fastened his eyes on the ser-
  geants brows and remained at attention

   your papa must be proud of you jail-
bird was the comment

   chaptel was compelled to admit to him-
self that his father was not proud of his son
but the non-com from long habit was able
to color his tone with subtle insult the
puerile papa combined with the suavely
pronounced jail-bird assumed tremen-
dously offensive qualities

   out in a year-no in eight months you

   the sergeant lighted a cigaret blew out
the match-

  never

   chaptel felt the blood rise to his face was
about to speak

  shut up duval warned

   it was not a whisper but a thought trans-
mitted without sound

  chaptel understood back-talk was un-
safe in prison the keepers first would
coax the prisoners into conversation then
gradually lash them into frenzy resulting
invariably in a lengthened term

  you have already made friends with
duval the sergeant resumed you must
be a pretty disgusting sort of fellow
youre known for what you are

  chaptel saw that duval was quivering
the non-com pressed his advantage he
walked closer blew smoke into duvals face

  you took the little man under your
wing nice boy isnt he youll be to-
gether a long while your breed never gets
out of here youll take your pal into the
hills paris good-by paris-and the
pretty girls do you ever think that if you
had worked one-tenth as hard in paris as
you have down out here you wouldnt be
here and to think how your tastes have
changed then as duval groaned in-
articulately-look me in the eyes du-
val what do you see you see the ser-
geant marietti knows hell get you before
you finish your term
knaves of spades



  im looking a pig in the eye marietti a
dirty corsican pig you have no witness
save that kid next to me and he wont back
you up you can ride me as much as you
want every time i see you ill look at you
youll know what im thinking marietti is
a -- corsican pig

  chaptel recalled much the same words
exchanged between small boys here were
two men vibrant with rage exchanging
puerile threats and resenting the implied
insults

  youre butting your head against a stone
wall marietti warned

  go learn to speak french duval sug-
gested mildly

  the average corsican non-com in the
french army keeps a strong trace of
italian accent and is sensitive on the sub-
ject marietti stood still then shook him-
self as if dazed he was about to speak
when the other non-com ran down the line
pushing the men into a semblance of order

  a group of officers was approaching the
major commanding the battalion con-
spicuous slim-booted legs broad shoulders
bronzed face a glitter of stripes and medals

  fixel marietti called himself freezing
in place hand to the vizor of his kepi

  awkwardly the men imitated him

  rest the major suggested mildly

  he turned to the lieutenant at his side

  you have the thing he asked

  here major

  the major received a folded sheet of paper
he was manifestly bored and desired to get
matters over with he scanned the paper
for several seconds spread his feet apart as
if to make a tremendous effort and read

  young men in the name of the bat-
talion i welcome you among us accept
bravely happily with dignity the trade of
the soldier learn to obey in silence to
respect and love discipline

  here the major turned to the lieutenant
impatiently pointed at the paper the
subaltern leaned forward and deciphered
the doubtful words in a low voice then
the major resumed

  there are many among you who remain
under the impression that your presence
here is an added punishment for the errors
of your past such a conception of the
african light infantry is erroneous and in-
sulting the battalion is not a unit for
punishment but a test corps you not
only are soldiers privileged to wear a uni-

form but you are entering a unit famed
for valor everywhere frenchmen have
fought the african light infantry has
been in africa in mexico in japan in
tonking in madagascar in china france
has trusted you with a flag would she
have done this had she believed you con-
victs the most glorious feat of arms in
thisvery algeria was done by your predeces-
sors mazagran one hundred and twenty-
three men against thousands victoriously
defending a town is that anything to be
ashamed of

  your past is forgotten you have paid
your debt forget the stories you have
heard before arriving here i am human
the officers are human and the sergeants
far from being the brutes they have been
depicted are honorable soldiers of sound
moral character

   if one of you ever feels that he has been
undeservedly punished let him come to
me i will investigate seek the truth and
if warranted will lift the punishment

  not bad thought chaptel the major
would not make a public promise which he
did not intend to keep the truth was
everything that had occurred up to now had
been principally verbal of course here
was duval just returned from the hills
where he claimed to have been hungry-
and marietti yet of the two the major
and marietti the first was the chief and
his intentions certainly were good

   if i find the punishment justly inflicted
the major concluded ill double it else
every one would complain and my time
would not suffice to hear all the tales
thats all

   there was a string to the altruistic offer
how often in a controversy between
sergeant and private would the low-rank
man be granted the benefit of the doubt

  the major left followed by the other
officers and tearing up the written speech
as he walked

   right by fours march marietti barked
leading the way to the main building

  he again halted by the door to allow the
men to file in

  hurry jail-birds blackguards scum
offals of the universe

  chaptel bent his head meekly

  like the chorus of a familiar song came
the mocking echo of the majors words
you are soldiers your errors of the
past are forgiven


adventure

up to his fifteenth year chap-
tel had enjoyed a peaceful fairly
prosperous home life his father
was a clerk in a notarys office
commanding a fair salary four hundred
francs a month which to a family of three
almost permitted luxury in school he
had made good in his studies and won
several purses which would entitle him to
free tuition in a lycee and his conserva-
tive father naturally wished him to em-
brace some paper-scratching profession

  but chaptel junior felt the call of a trade
a desire to learn of mechanical things not
abstractly but actually at length he was
permitted to become apprentice in a ma-
chine shop

  at seventeen he became known in the
small circle of the town for his deft handling
of motors this admitted him into the
society of men older than himself by several
years many of them having already served
their time in the army he soon became
familiar with the anti-militarist spirit he
had a quick tongue and was not devoid of
wit he soon learned the stock phrases of
the orators he heard in the cafes and jok-
ingly imitated them

  soon after his eighteenth birthday chap-
tel took part in a mass meeting denouncing
the authorities a strike in the silk mills
had recently been declared scarcely realiz-
ing the gravity of the situation he made
public speeches perhaps he went a trifle far

  sufficient to say that a certain afternoon
while delivering a fiery harangue he was
startled by the appearance of two husky
well-fed gendarmes in the doorway of the
hall they came down the aisle with slow
majestic tread one placed a hand on his
shoulder and suggested that he accompany
them to the commissary of police

  chaptel was aware that he had nothing
to fear a sermon a reminder of the
shame he was bringing upon his father a
warning and dismissal

  and so he smiled and assured the minions
of the law that he would be happy to follow
them wherever they might lead but the
crowd viewed the proceeding from another
angle the self-elected leader pushed be-
tween the young man and the gendarmes
and informed the latter that it were best for
them to leave the place peaceably there
was a little shoving a few verbal threats

  who struck the first blow no one ever
could find out with certainty the gen-

darmes said the strikers the strikers ac-
cused the gendarmes suddenly chaptel
found himself the center of a milling group
while a hand on his collar tugged him this
way and that the hand of the corporal of
gendarmes the pull on his throat half
strangled him and he struck out desper-
ately without conscious aim the man
holding him fell to the floor was trampled
upon his partner drew first his saber
then his revolver firing several shots into
the ceiling

  reserves of gendarmes stationed out-
side rushed in there was the sound of
beefy fists on meaty faces much shouting
chaptel found himself in the open street
solidly held by two uniformed men and
shoved through a menacing crowd while
ten feet behind the corporal of gendarmes
his face streaming blood followed sup-
ported by solicitous comrades

  at the commissary of police he was
severely beaten by the gendarmes bruised
aching in every hmb he was thrown into a
cell that night his father whom he had
summoned sent him a curt note declaring
that he had washed his hands of the whole
affair that edmonds mother was broken
hearted and that he had engaged a lawyer

  the lawyer was efficient blows costing
the loss of an eye are usually punished by a
minimum of two years in prison had the
gendarme pushed the charge chaptel would
have been given the full penalty

  but he appeared in court with a bandage
over his eye and eloquently pleaded for the
young man describing the scene of conflict
and frankly admitting that chaptel had
reacted to instinct he advised acquittal
saying that two wrongs do not make a right
and that the thought of a boy of eighteen in
prison would add to his unhappiness it is
to be suspected that a large part of chaptel
seniors savings contributedjto this leniency
even so chaptel was given six months an
extraordinarily mild sentence for such an
offense

  at first the keepers were not gentle
particularly those who indulged in strong
drink they had a habit of waking a
prisoner up on a cold night taking him
naked into the yard and administering
various tortures not included in the penal
code then blue notes wisely distributed
took effect chaptel became a sort of pay-
ing guest loafed about the yard smoked
cigarets read endless piles of paper-covered
knaves of spades



books loaned by the head keepers wife
stupified by the sugary novels coughing
from too many cigarets weak from lack of
exercise he was turned out when his time
was up

  his first ordeal was the home-coming the
tongue lashing his father had held in reserve
his mother aged ten years in sixmonths the
savings of twenty years dented beyond re-
covery

  when he attempted to join his former
friends in the cafe they turned away after
explaining that they did not approve of the
way he had behaved in court-room and jail
he should have been more defiant should
have scorned to accept the gendarmes
pity chaptel bitterly retorted that none
of the talkers had offered to come forward
and take the blame

  after a year things settled down to rou-
tine again chaptel recalled his prison
term merely as a sort of bad dream of utter
boredom he avoided looking in the
windows of newspaper stores for fear he
would see the mawkish novels by the au-
thors he had perused when stew was on
the table at home he did not eat that
was all in the shop the nickname of
convict playfully applied to him on his
return was forgotten he fondled cylin-
ders and levers with his greasy hands
whistled and was happy

  when the time approached for his mili-
tary service he sought out the probable
garrison to inform himself as to the amuse-
ments to be obtained he even thought of
enlisting in the marines for the opportunity
of seeing foreign lands

  the notice that he was to report to the
first battalion of african light infantry
came as a shock he investigated and
found there was no way to escape the
ordeal

 and so he now found himself in ain
saffra here also his father was to send
him a few francs each month for his minor
comforts

duval occasionally produced a
money order for a small sum from
an uncertain source together
they went to the zgag chergui
east street to an arab cafe where they
smoked and drank thick coffee out of metal
cups sprawling on clean mats forgetting
for the time the discomforts of bar-
racks

  of his life previous to his arrival in the
battalion duval spoke little that he
was from paris could not be concealed
his accent his mannerisms were ample
proof why he had gone to prison chap-
tel never could learn of the penitentiary
duval could and would speak

  he spun long yarns of terrific labor un-
der the sun of freezingly cold nights of
beatings by sergeants in charge of the
camp biribi as the place was nicknamed
was hell the guards were native tirail-
leurs greedy vicious unless bribed they
made ones life a burden if their liking
could be obtained however many privi-
leges were acquired they permitted loafing
on a task for the small price of two or three
cigarets for a half a pound of sugar they
allowed their charges to go to the nearest vil-
lage after the pastimes the place af-
forded

  as he had served twenty-one months in
the battalion before his condemnation to
the penitentiary in the hills he knew the
tricks without him chaptel would have
spent half that first week in the guard
house for dingy buttons and unclean arms
it is no unusual thing for the veterans to
make a mistake when called for inspec-
tion shift rifles on the rack and cause the
recruit to be sent to confinement and the
extra drill squad duval met this danger
by tying to his piece various metallic orna-
ments distinguishable to the touch-a coat
button a shoe lace chaptel imitated him
and attained the specklessness required by
regulations

  they made plans to enter into business
when their time was served duval get-
ting out earlier would look around paris
he said he was tired of the queer life he had
been leading that he wanted to be a solid
citizen his girl the preferred one among
many was willing to marry him she
must be sincere for his friends in paris
wrote him concerning her she was work-
ing as a seamstress

  you wait chaptel ten years from
now well be laughing at this bunch down
here

  i hope so chaptel produced a news-
paper pointed out items of interest the
aeroplane is being perfected duval thats
what i want to do in ten or twelve years
it will be as universal as the automobile is
today

  bicycles and autos will do for me


adventure

there were traits in duvals
character that worried chaptel
he was a bully to other recruits
and even held the older men in
subjection chaptel had seen him sud-
denly leap forward and almost twist a com-
rades arm out of the socket in answer to
chaptels remonstrance he grinned

  those pigs if a fellow didnt keep them
at respectful distance life wouldnt be
bearable

  as for sergeant marietti duval said that
he was craftily biding his time that his al-
most friendly manner was a blanket for his
hatred the non-com had stool pigeons in
the dormitory duval before going to bed
each night and many times during the day
inspected his blankets and advised chaptel
to do the same on three occasions they
found money concealed in the folds of the
bedding marietti broke in abruptly de-
clared that some one had complained of
being robbed and searched the beds du-
val who had discovered the men in the ser-
geants game had replanted the silver where
it would backfire

  smilingly he underwent the investiga-
tion

  not this time sergeant you missed
the last train

  good good i didnt suspect you du-
val but i have to do my duty

  why should i steal with only sixty
days to serve

  thats right youre almost through
arent you im glad for you

  ill send you postal cards from paris
  thanks

  and the search passed on

  the major was never once known to lift
a punishment several of the more gul-
lible recruits reported episodes at the bat-
talion office invariable result they had
their sentence doubled the oldest axiom
is that the superior is always right the
foundation and mainstay of discipline

  one afternoon chaptel was on duty while
duval was free he had stated that he
would go to the post office as money-orders
were due at the six oclock roll call he
was still missing he returned at eleven
to get his blankets preliminary to entering
the guard house for having outstayed his
leave

  chaptel awoke

  where were you

i all over

 youve been on a souse chaptel ac-
 cused smelling the unmistakable odor of
 absinthe

 yes but i couldnt get drunk

 youll get pulled in for another five
 years if you keep on you told me your-
 self the stuff made you crazy

 what the-do i care five years

 more or less--

 chaptel sat up

 whats wrong

 i got a letter my woman-

 sick

 duval laughed

 no rich guy and me with only
 sixty days more to serve she had waited
 seven years nearly can you understand
 that

 no forget it and find another one
 chaptel advised lying back and pulling up
 the blankets

 duval did not appear to him to be a man
 who would allow flowery sentiment to over-
 whelm his common sense

 you dont understand it wasnt the
 woman i wanted its the person who had
 faith in me waited all that time

 getting yourself into trouble wont help
 any trot to the guard house sober up
 and pull your stretch to the end like a little
 lamb

 you may be right

 mariettis voice came from the outside-
 duval are you coming tonight or must
 i wait until tomorrow

 right away sergeant

 duval bent close to chaptel

 maybe if i could get away tonight-
 reach paris-there might be a chance the
 man is from some small dump-and is buy-
 ing her things furniture dresses in paris-
 so shell follow him to the old home town
 shes getting her price all right my friends

 tell me everything in the letter i-

 dont be a fool duval

 marietti bearing a lantern followed by
 two men under arms came into the vast
 room the sound of his hobnailed boots
 on the floor awoke many of the sleepers
 speculative murmurs arose

 get a move on or ill double what ive
 handed you

 yes sergeant

 holding his blankets under one arm du-
 val took his place between the armed men
 and left

 chaptel heard marietti  chuckle as he
knaves of spades



gained the door the private on the bed
next to duvals got up and followed the ser-
geant there was a whispered conversation
at the far end of the room silence then
mariettas footsteps receded

  chaptel waited until the stool-pigeon
had gained his bed for several minutes
he struggled against temptation then im-
pelled by his friendship for duval he came
to a decision his bayonet hung on a peg
at the head of his cot beneath the plank
supporting his belongings he grasped the
scabbard with his left hand and drew the
weapon out with precaution naked blade
in hand he slipped out of bed shaking with
excitement

  evidently the stool-pigeon had no con-
science for he had already fallen asleep
chaptel twined his fingers in his hair and
laid the steel against his neck

  a half groan half curse came from the fel-
low

  i wont move what do you want

  what did you tell marietti

  i wont tell

  chaptel pricked his throat with the
point-

  listen i wont need much to push it
home

  push ahead the others are awake
youll be shot 

  no one gives a - what happens to

you theyre all sick of you they wouldnt
give me away chaptel answered

  if you bleed the swine kid ill treat you
on my next money some one prom-
ised

  go ahead chaptel push well keep
mum

  do you hear chaptel asked

  i told marietti about-his-woman

  you did eh

  chaptel straightened up went to his cot
and slid the bayonet into the scabbard he
trembled more than ever he knew that
he had been very near killing a man yes
it would not have taken much for chaptel
to have pushed

  he knew marietti and the foul epithets
the sergeant could summon the unbeliev-
ably coarse allusions given the rich ma-
terial of duvals recent misfortune he
would outdo himself sober duval had
enough biting wit to keep the sergeant at
bay but with an absinthe-soaked brain
he could not keep calm in his simple loy-
alty to duval he wished to be at his side

was willing to risk a few days prison for the
sake of helping him through the night

 he slipped on trousers and coat and ran
 out of the building barefooted the officer
 of the day was not in the watch room the
 orderly murmured something vague con-
 cerning rounds chaptel surmised that the
 lieutenant had ducked into town

what could he do he thought of the
doctor who had proved so understanding
but he was not in the barracks at night he
lived far out on the other side of town
and chaptel had no pass to get by the
sentries

he hesitated then made for the guard-
house

 before the lockup the sentry held him off
 with the bayonet point

what do you want

 i want to get in there

 the sentry laughed

some drunk youve got-wanting to
break into the guardhouse

 let me in pleaded chaptel

 id be willing if youd get a sergeant to
 back you up

 where can i find a sergeant

 theyre all in there that big fellow
 duval is soused theyre having fun with
 him

 let me in

 listen friend you try to sneak by and
 ill hand you one with this paper cutter
 then the guard felt it his duty to give ad-
 vice go to bed and sleep it off

do you mind if i hang around

go to it old man that doesnt con-
cern me

 chaptel squatted on the ground some dis-
 tance away he was miserable the night
 was cool and he shivered far off the
 twelve strokes of midnight strung out

 must be amusing themselves in there
 grumbled the sentry they forgot to re-
 lieve me

 at one oclock chaptel was still there
 facing the sentry

 a man carrying a lantern passed through
 the yard chaptel entertained a wild hope
 that it was the lieutenant he rushed
 across to find an orderly

the lieutenants horse has colic he

explained talk about a-trade that

 brings you up at all hours

 chaptel wearily went back to his vigil
 two had just struck when the sound of loud
 voices came indistinctly from within the
io

adventure

building followed thumping as if men
were struggling

  hes done it thought chaptel

  he attempted to rush by but the sentry
barred the way brought the butt of his piece
against his chest

  stop you fool

  ten or fifteen minutes later the door
swung open chaptel drew back into the
shadows the guard thinking he had so-
bered up was merciful and did not inform
marietti of his presence

  the corsican paused in the lighted door-
way he was rearranging his tunic collar

  he tore off two buttons he remarked
it was lucky i thought of having you fel-
lows handy i would have been choked
sure as death

  he held out long didnt he remarked
another non-com i thought hed burst
he was swelling so much the last thing
you said was a good one though marietti
he laughed and repeated the sentence he
looked as if you had torn his liver out
hes a bad egg agreed marietti i
thought he was going to hold out all night
but hes good for a court martial now look
at the scratches on my neck-five years-
five years-iu stick around here until he
gets back and get him another five

  what did he do to you marietti i for-
got to ask

  he said my nose was twisted in front of
all the other scum

  it is laughed the other

  perhaps marrietti assented but to
have an equal say it or that apache-well
theres a difference

  not quite comprehending dazed and
cold chaptel went back to bed

as marietti had taken the
precaution to have four non-coms
with him witnesses against du-
val were not lacking chaptel
of course could not get into the rooms when
the court martial was held perhaps fear-
ing that the truth would come out were
chaptel allowed to speak marietti sent
him to the guardhouse on the morning of
the event and kept him there throughout the
trial which did not last long

  chaptel hoping to obtain an interview
with the doctor and inform him of the real
fact feigned sickness marietti was not de-
ceived he came with three men whom he
trusted closed the door of the cell behind

him and proceeded to manhandle chaptel
knowing that the sergeant was acting with-
out orders that he would not dare make the
episode public chaptel fought back as long
as he was able it took the combined ef-
forts of the three men to stretch him on his
cot one man sat across his legs another
on his head holding his wrists marietti
then unbuckled his belt and flogged him

  bleeding heartbroken more from the
raging helplessness than from the pain of
the blows chaptel finally ceased to strug-
gle accepted the beating and even pleaded
for mercy as marietti demanded

  youll stay here for a couple of weeks
until you get better the sergeant declared
i know your tricks

  in two weeks when chaptel was released
he learned that duval had been condemned
to biribi for five years

  he went straight to the doctor told his
story not admitting a detail

  sorry-the decision against duval is ir-
revocable the doctor informed him you
must admit it was somewhat his fault he
deliberately incurred the sergeants resent-
ment

  what about me

  you were not seriously hurt in any
case you have no witnesses marietti
could easily make it seem that you attacked
him the major thinks highly of him
what do you think of it yourself
doctor

  i the doctor smiled i dont know
just what to think you seem of different
breed from the lying brood here but just
the same you told me you coaxed mariettis
informer how did you do it with your
bayonet

  oh you know that

  marietti told me from an aloof stand-
point i disapprove of informers from the
viewpoint of the officer interested only in
the good of the whole i am compelled to
realize the usefulness of the stool-pigeon
many a murder has been prevented through
him

  im sure there must be a way to get jus-
tice doctor cant you advise me shall
i go to the major

  frankly i wouldnt advise you to do so
he has little sympathy with duval who
came here with a bad record and has lived
up to it did you know that he narrowly
escaped the guillotine before coming here
no sir
knaves of spades

ii

  he was involved in the murder of an old
woman no positive proof of guilt could be
obtained that alone saved him do you
know what they nickname him in barracks
and at the penitentiary le couperet-the
slicer

  i never heard that name applied to him

  he doesnt like it and youre his
friend they woudnt dare use it before
you do you remember what i told you
to keep clear you disregarded my advice
think it over

  the doctor turned and set to work on the
papers before him

  doctor- faltered chaptel

  get out if every private wasted as
much of my time as you do when would i do
anything

  chaptel joined his heels saluted and left

  he felt that he was no match for the ex-
perienced marietti who had told just enough
to the doctor to forestall an investigation

  whether in spite of his pretended dis-
trust the doctor had warned marietti to
leave chaptel alone or the sergeant was
satisfied with what he had thus far accom-
plished he changed utterly in behavior
toward the private generally he ignored
him and when he did notice him it was to
show a certain degree of kindness chaptel
applied for leave until midnight some time
later and it was granted

  ain aaffra boasted several beuglants-bel-
lowers music-halls frequented by the troop-
ers as a rule the privates occupied the
outer tables the non-coms were placed
nearer the stage while the officers had front
reserved seats the entertainment was
not high class antiquated ladies veterans
of every small town in france performed
dances and sang

  the officers absorbed alcohols of various
description and fancy cocktails the ser-
geants drank beer the privates drank wine
a specially concocted drink cost forty to
fifty centimes a glass of beer twenty while
the wine imbibed by the troopers sold for
twenty-five centimes a liter or approxi-
mately ten centimes a glass two different
brands of absinthe existed one for officers
and non-coms one for the privates for
ten centimes a private could buy a glass
for less than a franc complete oblivion
cheap at the price many considered

  chaptel had never been a hard drinker
one or two glasses of wine seldom three
but this particular night having no one

to talk to and feeling very lonely the
mechanical gestures were repeated sliding
a copper coin across the table lifting the
glass-first wine then absinthe

  at first the songs bored him gradually
he found himself laughing then he beat
the rhythm on the table top and sang the
chorus the painted ladies he had scorned
at first now seemed as light as fairies pranc-
ing on soft springy fields through the
alcoholic haze they were deified a fat
good-natured blonde performer kindled ad-
oration in his heart

  shes beautiful he muttered

  he made such a disturbance applauding
that marietti seated with a group of friends
turned around and saw him the sergeant
laughed and nodded grateful for the small
recognition chaptel stood up and saluted
resuming his seat he stared about him com-
placently and announced to the universe in
general and to the waiter in particular-

  you see-he knows me

  marietti knew him-he was the only one
in this strange place in this stranger
country who had ever nodded to him
not a bad man marietti a little rough
perhaps yes a little rough but men with
rough exteriors often had kind hearts
marietti had a kind heart had he not
recommended him chaptel for leave to-
night

  he wondered why had he ever disliked

marietti

  oh he had it marietti had kidded
duval into striking him and then had him
sent to the hills duval who was his friend
was that right

  his feelings shifted with the elusiveness of
smoke one moment he worshiped mari-
etti the next he hated him something
was needed to crystallize in his sodden brain
one of the two emotions admiration or
hatred

  the waiter a stocky spaniard touched
him on the shoulder

  friends of yours outside

  friends

  chaptel could think of no friends

  they must be the waiter insisted
they gave me this to tell you they wanted
to speak to you

  he exhibited a fifty centime piece in his
palm

  gravely chaptel placed another be-
side it

  thank you i will go


adventure

        he dodged a table skirted
poi another by a fraction of an inch
and gained the open door the
-cooler air swept his face it was
delicious to breathe freely after the smoky
hall chaptel forgot his mission leaned
against the wall smoking

  two civilians standing not far off eyed
him speculatively for a few minutes vague-
ly annoyed chaptel returned the stare
one of the men was long and thin and the
other short and thin their faces were
familiar yet he knew he had never seen
them before he reasoned the stamp of
the prison he recognized-they had some-
time been battalion men

  at length the smaller man made up his
mind and came forward diffidently

  are you chaptel

  yes what do you want

  our names dont matter call me
charles if you want were friends of
duval

  hes at the pen

  we know he wrote us all about it
we came down to execute marietti

  no joke

  the short man smiled joyously

  do i look like a joke did we come
from paris for a joke do we risk our be-
ing recognized--we both served here-for a
joke

  what do you want me to do asked
chaptel

  help us marietti was not our ser-
geant we dont know who he is you
dont need to do anything more describe
him tell us where he hangs out

   chaptel laid a finger across his lips im-
portantly

  surprize he whispered

  hes drunk the man who called him-
self charles informed the other cant
get anything out of him

  im not warmly protested chaptel
i have a surprize look in there through
the doors see that red-faced striper be-
tween the quarter-master sergeant of
zouaves and the guy with the red whiskers
you know who that is ah-ah-that is
marietti

  enough said now get back to bar-
racks youll need an alibi

  do you think im a quitter duval was
my friend chaptel grumbled ill beat
him up too he beat me up

  listen advised charles this will be

more than a beating youll get blamed for
it unless some one saw you elsewhere at the
time

  what do i care

  get some sense chaptel the other
guy and i cant put this off we came in on
the quiet we can get away tonight on the
quiet if we wait well be pinched youve
done your share beat it

  wbat do you think i am

  charles grasped him by the arm pulled
him along the sidewalk away from the lights
of the cafe the other man followed si-
lently he did not say a word his long
face quiet eyes almost gentle smile fright-
ened chaptel

   what does he keep his hand in his pocket
for he asked

  shut up tell us what you know
dont ask questions where does the ser-
geant go from here usually

where dont make me laugh chap-
tel recalling tales of the non-coms behavior
outside barracks mentioned an address in
the arab quarter ill take you there
we know the place

   ill show you chaptel insisted
charles spoke to the other in a low voice
the tall man shrugged

   its his funeral he said speaking for
the first time everything is arranged for
tonight we couldnt get away with it to-
morrow i for one will not go back with-
out doing what i said id do

  all right chaptel charles concluded
  lead on

  as they walked he explained

  duval the two of us and some others-
were together the fingers of one hand
duval has done little jobs for us he wrote
that hed consider it even if we did up mari-
etti in style between pals that sort of
thing cant be refused

  no agreed chaptel heartily duval
is a fine fellow

  ub-not always when his selfishness
is in play he knows no friend but we
want him back sometime he hasnt an
equal for certain jobs

  have you arranged for your getaway
chaptel asked

   his brain was clearing and he was specu-
lating for the first time on the consequences
of tonights job

didnt any one see you get into town
no and no one will think this is an
outside job theyll question the privates
knaves of spades



tomorrow is friday market day we
came in with a bunch of spaniards italians
and arabs as soon as we finish well hop a
freight train-the depot isnt well watched
anyway-and be far from here by morning
we have return tickets from a certain place
to algiers in that place i have business
real business i joined the useful to the
agreeable on this trip and got the repre-
sentation of a wine firm he- charles
jerked a thumb over his shoulder toward the
silent partner--is my assistant see

in a few minutes the trio had
left the strictly european part
of ain saffra and were making
their way through the narrow
streets of the town bound for the special
quarter it was the custom of marietti to
end his evenings of liberty here watching
the ouled nails dancing girls do the danse
du ventre he and a few dilettantes of his
ilk were noted frequenters of a celebrated
establishment reputed to offer the prettiest
representatives of the art as a fortunate
coincidence marrietti was rich tonight soon
after pay day he could not fail to turn his
steps toward hospitable portals

  when the rhythmical tread of the patrols
drew near charles would hurry to shelter
at last they halted within the shadow of a
door their backs glued against the panel of
wood guttural singing from a house three
doors away betrayed the place where mari-
etti was known to go

  the tall man brought his hand out of the
coat pocket came a metallic sound
charles also was fumbling with metal objects

  american punch he volunteered which
meant brass-knuckles

  and whats he got chaptel asked re-
ferring to the other

  a sticker eh bibi show this boy
bibi at last identified handed his knife
to chaptel who felt the blade in the dark-
ness it was a full seven inches sharp as a
razor in the hands of a resolute man it
was a fearsome weapon the click chaptel
had heard was the powerful spring opening

  had bibi been about to use a pistol had
charles frankly carried a club chaptel
might not have been brought to his senses
but the typical apache weapons shocked
and frightened him he had always dread-
ed the thought of a knife wound imagining
the sharp pain if the blade were driven into
the pit of the stomach he would have

faced a gun without shrinking but would
have fled from a knife

  youre going to-hit him-with those

  of course not were merely playing
scoffed charles

  youll kill him

  thats what

  i wont have anything to do with it i
thought youd beat him up thats all

  cold feet i dont blame you well
get away theyll pinch you youre ripe
for the firing squad we tried to tell you
but-

  i must go

  no ones keeping you here by the way
if any one asks you about us itll be health-
ier to know nothing eh

  all right

  without another word chaptel hurried

away

  the walk and the cold air had sobered
him he was disgusted with himself
knifing an unsuspecting man regardless of
what that man had done was dirty the
doctor had been right-he was sinking

  i swear never to mix with them again
he told himself as he ran if i get out of this
safe

  he prayed that marietti would change
his mind and return dutifully to barracks
failing that he hoped that he himself would
make the barracks before the time of the
attack he retained enough calm to hide
from patrols once he bumped against an
elderly native who turned and cursed him
shaking a stick in his direction chaptel
instinctively averted his face

  out of breath he hid in another doorway
no sooner had he done so than he saw the
glint of brass buttons down the street he
glimpsed mariettis face as he passed be-
neath a lamp the sergeant was alone
walking at his usual gait he passed six
feet from chaptel but did not appear to
notice him he was whistling gaily one of
the late songs chaptel decided to stop
him and warn him but the sergeant dis-
appeared from view and he feared to run
after him marietti was quite capable of
having him imprisoned perhaps sent to the
pen regardless of the warning

  guardedly chaptel risked himself in the
open once more and walked with all the dig-
nity he could command toward the barracks
which he found himself calling home so
much did he desire to be safe within the
friendly walls


adventure

  suddenly he halted breathing hard
from behind had come three pistol shots
in quick succession he wondered if they
were connected with the sergeant and the
two gentlemen waiting there when shouts
followed the shots he hurried on he was
young and boasted good lungs moreover
he was in danger he tore down the streets
at a mad pace as luck would have it straight
into a patrol rushing toward the distur-
bance

  with alacrity he shortened his stride
saluted the non-com in command and
effaced himself with a polite gesture to allow
the six men to pass his ruse failed

  you come with us my friend sugges-
ted the patrol commander i heard you
running

  i was in a hurry to get back before roll
call protested chaptel

  either your pass calls for liberty until
ten oclock and youre overdue already or
it calls for midnight which gives you an
hour to kill the sergeant pointed out logi-
cally theres queer goings on here to-
night

  nothing to do but retrace his steps under
escort he shuffled miserably between two
privates of zouaves they did nothing to
ease chaptels mind between the zouaves
and the joyeux as the battalion men are
called there was little love lost

  pretty head for the guillotine remarked
one

  the patrol now had to push its way
through a shouting swarm of natives who
had rushed out with torches toward the
scene of the shooting

  marietti was the center of an excited
group of non-coms from the cafe the
sergeant was rearranging his tunic under
his left eye the beginning of a mouse was
showing his cheek was lacerated bleeding
one leg of his trousers was ripped open and
a friend was bandaging a cut doubtless
from the knife wielded by bibi

  charles was a few feet away face down
bibi was seated limp against the wall his
head hung down on his chest and chaptel
knew that he would be silent for all eternity
strangely enough his feeling was one of
deep admiration for marietti taken by
surprize the sergeant had dropped two men
in three shots for the first time chaptel
understood how he had earned the medals
he wore marietti was a brute but he was
also a fighter and a cool-headed soldier

  the commander of the patrol made in-
quiries

  as i came close to the cafe marietti
narrated those two jumped out at me
the tall one was nearest and brought down
his knife i leaped back he fell over and
instead of stabbing me in the stomach he
ripped my leg open i lowered my gun and
shot him through the back while he was
doing it the short fellow punched me in the
face with that contraption of his i saw
thirty candles for a moment if he had kept
after me id have gone down but the one
shot had scared him and he ran away i
missed him with one shot got him with the
second

  thunder the patrol leader approved
that was fine work he laughed softly
i nabbed one of your birds running away
on the chance he was mixed in it but i
guess he was too far from here ill let him
go

  chaptel released by the zouaves was
making for the open streets when marietti
halted him

  stick around chaptel youre under
arrest

 why

  for investigation marietti turned
and explained to the listeners i saw this
fellow hiding in a doorway down below he
thought he was hidden but the fight shone
on his buttons

  chaptel became aware that the brass
fasteners on his coat must in fact have glin-
ted as brilliantly as those of the sergeant

  marietti went on

  thats why i was on guard when these
fellows made for me i told myself mari-
etti that fellow hasnt got a clean con-
science i was glad i had my gun the

- with a revolver i fear nobody i

was in the tonking i was

  youre going back with this man the
patrol commander asked

  no send him back as for me i al-
low nothing to interfere with my pleasure
come on you fellows i treat i must show
my gratitude to heaven mustnt i

the chaptel case brought nov-
elty into the monotous routine
of the court martial

  the ordinary case of insults
slapped sergeants punched corporals the
tedious recitals of voluntary destruction
of government property sank into the
knaves of spades



background here was an attemped assas-
sination in which two outsiders figured
both charles and bibi had been identified
as former members of the battalion but
it was soon decided that they had not acted
in a personal quarrel for neither had been
under marietti or even in touch with him
during his time of service

  a civilian lawyer volunteered to defend
chaptel he argued long with chaptel in
an attempt to make the private tell the com-
plete story how he had come to know
charles and bibi chaptels criminal record
had taken place in eastern france far from
the haunts of the apaches yet the waiter
at the music hall declared that they had
specifically asked for him had even pointed
him out

  chaptel refused to talk not because of
his loyalty to duval which had been consid-
erably lessened in view of recently acquired
knowledge but the fear that there might
exist more members of the duval-charles-
bibi gang judging from experience they
were a resolute bunch and a man who crossed
them was not likely to enjoy a long life of
unmarred happiness after a little thought
it became clear to him how the two strangers
had picked him up out in the cafe on his
first outing with duval they had gone to a
photographer to procure pictures pictures
which were sent to duvals girl

  under strict application of military code
chaptel was in serious danger of being shot
his lawyer however assured him that he
could save him but did not guarantee to get
him off lightly unless he would make a clean
breast of everything

  so chaptel was not in the best of spirits
when he faced the judges

  the doctor testified for him pleaded that
even a young man of fine character could be
led astray that he was sure there was more
to the case than appeared on the surface
his most damaging evidence was the fact
that chaptel had come to him on behalf of
duval and that marietti had been the
means of sending duval to the public works

  marietti coming forward to testify with
his swollen eye reminded chaptel forcibly of
the gendarme in france the corsican was
deeply embarrassed at ease before a crowd
of forty privates the glittering row of offi-
cers dazed him it was several minutes be-
fore his sentences were coherent the poor
fellow had been in the army so long re-
spected rank so deeply so sincerely that

he faced his superiors with the same humil-
ity the battalion men faced him

  sacred thunder sergeant speak
clearly

  the major under whom marietti had
served for many years put him at ease

  the familiar words gave marietti a fash-
ion of landmark in his maze of statements
he launched out boldly used mild curses-
as long as the major used them he could-
described the attack and his defense in much
the same way he had spoken to the crowd
on the night in question he told of seeing
chaptel of his hunch that something was
wrong

  when he seemed through with his story
the major indicated that he was at liberty
to leave the stand but the sergeant lifted
his hand for permission to go on

  it aint my business he said to tell
messieurs the officers what to do in a case
like this but i sort of feel that having
been as you might say the center of the
trouble having my leg ripped open and my
face punched i know more about this than
most

  he paused respectfully to permit the offi-
cers to end their laughter looking about him
to see the cause then went on

  theres not a man knows the fellows i
command better than i i can tell whether
theyre good or bad now this young one
here today hes all right

  chaptel started this was strange talk
from marietti

  hes a good man i mistook him at
first for a bad egg he was hanging out
with duval thats saying a lot nobodys
asking me to give my ideas here but maybe
theyre good i think this duvals at the
bottom of the whole business chaptel is a
different breed he wouldnt knife a man

  chaptel stood up

  i wouldnt i was somewhat drunk i
thought they wanted to beat you up thats
all

  the waiters testimony of having deliv-
ered a message to chaptel had established
beyond doubt his acquaintance with the
would-be murderers

  beat me up thats enough marietti
remarked i had to beat chaptel up once
when he wanted to make a lot of fuss over
duval

  its against regulations to strike a man
the major chided

  theres lots of things against regulations
i

adventure

tying a man to a tree when a tiger is howl-
ing around-thats not printed in regula-
tions marietti laughed softly that
was done in indo-china to scare some of
the toughs into being good boys

  active service-necessity snapped the
major who evidently knew who was re-
ponsible for the punishment just mentioned

  yes major what i mean to say is
dont be hard on chaptel he licked the
costaud-strong guy-of the room hes in
and refused to take graft that shows he
doesnt belong here

  the court will consider you may go
sergeant

  marietti saluted gave an understanding
wink to chaptel and made room for the
next witness the zouave non-com who
had commanded the patrol he brought
no new light on the subject took up much
time narrating just what places he had vis-
ited and was excused before he had told
ought concerning chaptel

  the captain representing the army got to
his feet patently he didnt care about the
job he contented himself with saying that
in his opinion chaptel was a potential mur-
derer and should be given the extreme pen-
alty within the power of the court the
effect of his brief utterance was considerably
lessened by the casual way in which he ut-
tered it

  followed a painful ordeal for chaptel
his lawyer stood waved his ample black
sleeves became pitiful animated sad happy
in turn painting the home life of the pris-
oner until the first misstep he brought
the accused mans mother into play an
honorable father who had never been re-
proached for a dishonest action chaptel
wished he would stop he was marring the
effect of mariettis straight-forward speech

  when the lawyer at last sat down every
one in the room was utterly bored

  the military judges conferred briefly and
the major arose

  the court martial condemns the accused
edmond chaptel to five years public works
only five years the lawyer said jubi-
lantly i gripped them

article two of the regulations
governing the military peniten-
tiaries of the french republic
reads as follows

   the efforts of the various military authorities
must tend toward the moral reform of the prisoners

  it is therefore of prime importance that they be
classified according to the cause of their imprison-
ment and of their antecedents

  they will be separated in as complete a fashion
as the organization will allow into classes those
condemned for crimes or misdemeanors covered by
the ordinary penal laws and those condemned for
solely military crimes moreover in each of those
classes there will-be an attempt to isolate the second
offenders from the others

  the prisoners will be managed so as to separate
the condemned men from those awaiting trial etc
etc

  when a private breaks sacred regulation
he is severely punished unless five years
labor for a nervous reflex might be consid-
ered a mild reproval the authorities them-
selves smashed the rules with impunity in
the penitentiaries the sheep are mingled
with the goats as for moral reform and a
special department for first offenders the
mere thought would send the non-coms
into spasms of laughter to them the con-
vict is one sort indivisible they reason
with unshakable logic that the man must be
no good in the first place or he would not
have come under their supervision

  chaptel was sent with a motley assort-
ment of other prisoners to a mountain camp
beyond ain ben khelil in western algeria
close to the moroccan frontier the de-
tachment was guarded by three mounted
gendarmes good-natured middle-aged men
who dug into their pockets at times to buy
drinks for the poorest of the group

  humanity from this unexpected source
touched chaptel and he resolved that he
would accept his lesson meekly and do
nothing to extend his term he dare not
think over much on the brutal knowledge
that his two years had suddenly stretched
into seven after five years in the peniten-
tiary he would be sent back to ain saffra to
finish his regular term of service for the
months and years in criminal camp count
for nothing as far as the army is con-
cerned

  in truth he rather enjoyed the long hike
over the mountain trails the scenery was
awe-inspiring more rugged more savage
even than his home hills of jura the
natives no longer pure arabs but berbers
interested him he was surprized to find
among them many points of resemblance to
the french mountaineers the same stolid
patience and stocky build they evidenced
far less curiosity than his own people would
have shown before a convoy of convicts
they were not unkind and did not expect
 knaves of spades





more pay for their food from the prisoners
than from free men

  ain ben khelil he was not allowed to see
as a private of the african battalion he
had enjoyed some liberty as a convict of
course he could expect none the camp
constructed on a small plateau consisted of
a half dozen huts residences of the non-
coms in charge and fifteen huge tents
the marabout tents in which the prisoners
lived

  the sergeant-major in command counted
the new arrivals handed a signed receipt to
the gendarmes who bade their unfortunate
companions farewell and took the road
southeast

  it had been late in the afternoon when the
new men reached camp the tents were
empty for the occupants were at work on
the road of what use the road in this re-
gion visited by no one where the existing
paths were sufficient to the small commerce
of the natives chaptel could not see per-
haps it was a far-sighted provision for the
occupation of morocco

  the prisoners were assigned to different
tents chaptel drew number five near the
outer enclosure of spiny bushes as he
marched toward it he perceived perched
high on a lumber scaffold a turco-algerian
tirailleur-the principal sentry overlook-
ing from this vantage point the entire camp
day and night the tower was occupied by
a man with a loaded rifle chaptel began
to understand why escape was said to be
impossible any man leaving the tents
would be visible at some point of his journey
to the open country

  once inside the tent chaptel reeled back
before the stench occupied by hopeless
men most of them born to filth the surface
cleanliness chaptel had learned to associate
with the army was missing the place
reeked of sweat and unmentionable odors
dominated by the pungency of tallow and
oil the latter no doubt arising from the
clandestine candles and lamps used by the
prisoners at night

  you stay here until i tell you to come
out the sergeant suggested

  yes sergeant

  they were four assigned to this tent one
of the men brought out a greasy pack of
cards cigarets were lighted and the haze
of cheap tobacco added to the other odors
when a match was struck it seemed that
the flame found it difficult to blaze in the

   

thick air fluttering in the fog like a will o
the wisp

  at half past six the prisoners returned
from the road looking like a procession of
fantoms in long vizored caps and baggy
gray uniforms

  they did not address as much as a glance
at the newcomers but sank fully dressed on
their bedding many removed their shoes
the card game had ceased with the failing
light but the four clung together as if to
seek protection from the others the veterans

  the latest comer made for the group
kicked the nearest man in the back slapped
another

  out of my way scum

  this was undoubtedly the costaud the big
boss the man who collected his half on the
money and the food

  the way cleared he struck a match
lighted a cigaret chaptel read the number
across his left breast  sullen resent-
ment filled his heart not content with be-
ing tortured by the sergeants who at least
had the excuse of self-righteousness the
prisoners allowed one of their number to
tyrannize over them within the tents he
knew that sooner pr later he would come to
blows with the fellow not so much to save
his money or his belongings but to preserve
the lurking spark of self-respect that still
existed within him he would not repeat
here his mistake of the ain saffra barracks
and join a clique it would be hard to play
a lone hand for five years

  wine called the costaud who has
wine

  here

  some one got up in the obscurity guided
himself fumbling to the leader

  chaptel heard the gulps as the liquid left
the bottle

  for several minutes chaptel had been
scratching the tent had inhabitants not
mentioned in the official roster

  a low laugh came from the next pile of
blankets

  fresh meat well have a little rest now
until you four new ones ripen

  cooties

  youd call them that i guess but
theyre as large as rats some of them so
big you can tll them apart

  isnt anything done against them

  they issued powder at one time but
these ones seem to thrive on it you see
theyre foreigners

adventure

 what

 we had the usual kind until six months
 ago then two italians came up from the
 foreign legion and we got these they
 dont answer to usual treatment at all at
 all the man yawned id go to sleep
 but ive got to get them out of duvals shirt
 as soon as its safe to make a light

 achille duval

 dont know his first name  the
 man added in a whisper the slicer
 where is he 

 over there drinking

 is that him i know him

 i didnt say anything against him the
 unseen man went on hurriedly i just
 thought you might know him better by his
 nickname

 chaptel reassured him

 after a while he laughed no need for
 him to fight duval

 eagerly he made his way toward the
 costaud

 hello achille

 whos that speaking

 me edmond

 when did you come this afternoon
 i hope it wasnt you i kicked duval
 reached out with both hands and drew
 chaptel close you poor kid did they
 railroad you up here too

 i got what was coming to me all right
 you wait chaptel that swine mari-
 etti will be settled-soon

 evidently duval did not know of recent
 events the prisoners sole communication
 with the battalion was through the new ar-
 rivals and he chaptel had come with the
 first batch he told-the slicer of the at-
 tempt on mariettis life of the sergeants
 resistance of the death of charles and bibi
 duval trembled swore his first thought
 however was of himself

 you didnt squeal

 no

 youre a good kid duval patted him
 affectionately on the back dont fret
 marietti will get his yet

 hes a decent sort-he testified for me
 at the trial

 hes double-faced he hoped youd be
 acquitted then hed have asked you to
 tell on the rest thats the way he gets his
 informers

 chaptel was elated this was a marvel-
 ous stroke of luck to find duval in the peni-
 tentiary already enthroned as leader he

really liked him immensely and talking
with him soon destroyed his late suspicion
that duval might not be a safe companion

  listen kid duval said youre in
for a hard time tonight i cant help you
either

  what is it

  the sergeants will initiate you bichet
the big boss of this dump usually tries to
break your nerve the first evening he has
a half dozen different ways he hung me
by the thumbs for four hours to start me
right i think hes crazy

  is thgre any way to make him ease up
none that i know of youve got to go
through with it one man died last month
a guy from the foreign legion who could
hardly speak french bichet kept after
him trying to make him recite some piece
without anaccent the poor -- pro-
nounced p like b and b like p he could
control his tongue for one or two words but
before the end of his little speech he was
bound to fail you know how cold the
nights get here or you will know well
bichet kept him naked in the open then
threw him into one of the pits in the ground
used as a refrigerator the guy got pneu-
monia and croaked

  cant some one report him

  you know how that goes the officer
leaves you here while the charge is being
investigated bichet would see that you
were not around to speak when the time
came shot trying to get away thats
what happens and the tirailleurs of the
guard would lie for him

  chaptel tried to accept with fortitude the
prospect of torture strangely enough he
forgot the unpleasant future before a nearer
problem

  when do we eat

  tomorrow at ten we had our panikin
of soup at five you new fellows get noth-
ing its that much saved bichet says 
im hungry

  some one may have a crust left ill
ask

  but chaptel was unwilling to deprive
another of his hoarded provisions and he
was also reluctant to use duvals power for
his own comfort

  dont bother i can stand it

  he became aware of a grinding noise
within the tent as of metal being scraped
against stone

  whats that duval
knaves of spades



  some one making a knife

  a knife

  didnt they take your knife away
  yes

  well now if you want to get along
here youve got to keep your rights and
youve got to have a knife usually we turn
them out of a spoon they arent so good
but theyll do the business feel this
duval placed the knife in chaptels hand
long grinding against hard stones had given
it a double edge and a point as keen as a
razor

  one through the guts and your fellow
says nothing more about wind or weather
proclaimed the sheer

  did you ever use this

  no thats the new one i made since
coming up here before i had one that
confessed four fellows

  you killed four men achille

  it was either them or me and i preferred
it to be them catch on youll come to
it some time kid duval lowered his voice
you think being the costaud means only a
scrap now and then youre wrong youve
got to keep up your end or youd be done
for if some fellow licked me then some
other fool who was sore at me would do me
up even now i can never sleep sound
i imagine all the time that some man is crawl-
ing toward me with one of these stickers
chaptel stirred uneasily

  cant you make a light duval

not yet theres an inspection at nine
whats the matter scared these cattle
wont do anything while my eyes are open
the cattle rustled at duvals words
for he had spoken aloud

  is the work hard chaptel changed the
subject

  not if you know how to get away with it
the two hundred men are divided into
gangs each one under a sergeant the ser-
geants go to sleep in the shade i imitate
the sergeants and go to sleep im in good
with messaoud who has charge of our
bunch he always wakes me up before the
sergeant is up and about youd laugh the
way i get busy breaking stones squatted be-
fore a big heap

  you see each man has got to show what
hes done well the others chip in on mine
ill see that you dont sprain your wrists
breaking stones dont worry messaoud
trusts me and even lets me go to the village
two three hours at a time that dump

aint the boulevards but it seems good after
this- ill take you along

the flap closing the tent door
was suddenly drawn aside and a
man carrying a lantern appeared
a sergeant behind him two
turcos lebel rifle in hand stood casually

  holding the lantern high this non-com
one of the gang chiefs made the round of the
tent and counted the men duval stood
at attention and saluted meekly as did the
others

  the newcomers will follow me the ser-
geant said

  go kid and keep a stiff upper lip
whispered duval say whatever he wants
you to say good luck

  he pressed his hand warmly

  the moon was shining outside in the
brilliant light the hills were beautiful
chaptel found himself wondering how this
aggregation of human misery could exist
in this earthly paradise

  of the four new men chaptel was the
first to enter the sergeant-majors hut or
rather the hut used as an office a few
chairs a table a kerosene lamp hanging
from the ceiling-on the chairs the ser-
geant-major bichet the other gang-chief
and the youthful sergeant in charge of the
establishments book-keeping department

  bichet was a man of forty-two or -three
of medium height he wore a goatee im-
precise as to color mingled red and blond
his eyes were small and of a peculiar hazel
shade his smile was so mild that chaptel
found it hard to imagine him as the perpe-
trator of the cruelties narrated by duval

  like marietti he wore the colonial and
tonking medals and also a large enamel
plaque bestowed by the government of
tunis he smoked thin cigars with a straw
tip a cheap brand well known to chaptel
in fact but for the uniform he might have
been mistaken for a good-natured cafe-
keeper

  politely even suavely heasked the pris-
oners name inquired as to his record as
he spoke he rubbed his feet on the floor and
chaptel attracted by the movement looked
down the planking was stained

  the young sergeant scribbled in a register

  number  he announced

  thats your number chaptel your
new uniform is over there on the shelf
strip off what you have on


adventure

 chaptel still wore the white fatigue gar-
 ments of the battalion he obediently
 stripped and turned to go to the shelf

 just a minute my friend said bichet
 chaptel halted naked

 come back here

 the sergeant-major sucked thoughtfully
 the cigaret tip he beamed upon chaptel
 you have a good education

 hoping for a clerical position in the office
 against all possibilities chaptel enumerated
 his qualifications

 thats very good you have good relig-
 ious instruction also i presume you know
 your catechism

 i think i can remember something of it
 sergeant

 thats splendid bichet smiled hap-
 pily how many persons in god

 chaptel hesitated looked intently at the
 sergeant-major then deciding the man was
 serious replied-

 there are three persons in god sergeant
 yes who are they

 god the father-

 bichet interrupted him violently

 wrong you know no more than the
 other swine

 he signaled to the turcos standing by the
 door the two came in seized chaptel
 one of the sergeants came forward fastened
 two thin cords about chaptels thumbs a
 system of pulleys was employed to lift him
 until only his toes touched the floor

 will you give me that answer asked
 bichet

 i have given the only answer i know
 sergeant

 youll find out another before long pull
 there

 after fifteen minutes bichet patently felt
 that his repeated questions would never ob-
 tain an answer such as he desired he lis-
 tened for chaptels groans

 youre calling on the wrong person
 chaptel he declared who strung you
 up bichet who alone has power to re-
 lease you bichet

 yes sergeant

 now that you know who is god in this
 camp beg me to let you go

 chaptel knew the folly of resisting this
 blasphemous beast

 i beg you to let me go sergeant

 say your piece better than that-as if you
 were in church

 i implore you to let me go sergeant

  on your knees on both knees you im-
plore me

  yes sergeant

  fine ill let you go im good i am
but you have committed sacrilege chaptel
you didnt know who i was do you know
now who am i

  the blood was streaming down chaptels
arms where the cords had cut into the flesh
every muscle ached with the strain he
was faced by a man obviously demented
very likely drunk judging by the bottles
and tin cups on the table the others were
laughing what could he do

  he gave the desired answer

  bichet looked at his watch

  only twenty-five minutes you were
converted swiftly  some more de-
voted than you took seven and even ten
nights to see the light but they all come
to it

  chaptel was released and permitted to
sink down in a comer he was too weary to
dress the next man was brought in he
perceived chaptel glanced at the ropes at
the sergeants and began to tremble he
quivered more and more through the pre-
liminaries and when the turcos approached
to grasp him and tie his thumbs he fell to
the floor foaming at the mouth and kicking
right and left

  sacred- exclaimed bichet an

epileptic

  the sergeants left the room to get water
strangely eager to relieve the sufferer per-
haps they felt remorseful and afraid before
this unforeseen manifestation of a power
stronger than theirs

  writhing and howling the man beat the
floor with hands and feet turned over and
over he had bitten his tongue and the
flecks of foam on chin and chest were blood
stained he was a dreadful sight chaptel
watched him fascinated by the horror

  suddenly with his face hidden from the
turcos the man grinned at chaptel quickly
and winked at least one of the new comers
had the intelligence to find a way out chap-
tel chided himself for not having thought of
the trick the sergeants returned dashed
water over the prostrate man who at last
arose to his feet but at the first question
he fell again a magnificent bit of acting
indeed so well acted that chaptel himself
doubted his own eyes doubted that the grin
and the wink were not products of his own
super-excited brain
knaves of spades



  and bichet was defeated bichet gave up
get your clothing and beat it out he
ordered

  the other two were not so fortunate
they stated in due time who ruled the camp
after the same procedure used on chaptel
this concluded bichet harangued them

  you three are heretics i have a few
others of your sort cooling off outside youll
join them for the night

   as the trio started to get their clothes he
added

  not so fast boys you came into the
world hairless and naked you have hair
thats sufficient for an improvement
smiling blandly he led the way the cold
wind that swept the plateau chilled chaptel
immediately his teeth rattled	

  my-is cold said bichet

  he took them to a pit in the ground where
other naked men were huddled

  hop in there

  the first man hesitated and he pushed
him roughly the next slid in chaptel
who had never come to accept close skin
contact with others demurred

  thats a way to catch a disease he pro-
tested

  ah monsieur is dainty monsieur
wants a private boudoir all to himself gen-
tlemen  wishes a private chamber
astonished at this deference to his wishes
chaptel followed him the walk had some-
what abated the effect of the cold the
party came to another pit smaller and deeper
than the first one

  ill give you a last chance to be good
chaptel bichet suggested i want to
warn you that with the others youd be
warmer you can squeeze together and the
fellow who is strong enough to get inside the
bunch is in soft what do you say

   ill take this one

  all right get in

  chaptel slid down on the cold earth to the
moist bottom of the hole

  how do you find it

  the spring is hard and the mattress
damp sergeant but it will do

  bichet leaned over the edge holding the
lantern high

  do you know who was in there a fellow
who was sent to the hospital today

  chaptel made as if to leap out but one of
the turcos menaced him with a gun butt
the sergeants left laughing loudly and
chaptel was left alone naked in the cold

hole panic stricken at first he presently
saw through the sergeant-majors ruse the
last statement had doubtless been untrue
intended to frighten him

  in any case he told himself this cold
earth would kill any germs

  his feet and hands were already numb
he trotted around the hole beating at his
fingers the stars paled as the hours went
by

  chaptel was wondering how long it took to
make a spoon into a blade

chaptel was young strong
born with an iron resistance to
hardship his ancestors for gen-
erations had been peasants farm-
ers mountaineers out of the twelve men
in number one pit only two were sent down
the line to the hospital although their
parents were tuberculous alcoholic under-
nourished these men themselves seemed to
have their souls nailed to their bodies

  on the next morning chaptel was given
his clothes he gulped down a pint of weak
coffee and relegated his experience to the
past	

  at six he joined the gang bound for the
rock-pile he saw duval but as silence was
the iron-clad rule he dare not converse with
him when the men arrived at the point of
the road where the work of the day was to be
done the heavy hammers were distributed
the turcos took their posts rifles in hand
as for the sergeant in command he sought a
soft place in the shade stretched out his
cap shading his face and went to sleep re-
gardless of pounding hammers and an oc-
casional altercation between the sentries
and the convicts

  refusing duvals offer to be freed from
work at the expense of the others he swung
the tool with good will as for duval he
lighted a cigaret sat in the shade keeping
an eye on the sergeant and snarled his orders
to the others who came in turn to do their
stint toward his rightful share of labor
duval handed messaoud the corporal a
cigaret and conversed with him in the broken
speech half-arab half-french that the tur-
cos used

  at ten the first meal of the day was
brought from the kitchens in large pails
the rations were fairly generous boiled
beans a few ounces of beef plenty of bread
washed down with a pint of coarse biting
red wine for duval the cooks had sent a


adventure

tidbit two short thick sausages and a raw
onion seemingly duvals leadership was
recognized outside of his tent

  between ten and twelve the temperature
rose the hillside was flooded with sunlight
and the broken stones glittered like dia-
monds after eating the sergeant went
back to sleep a native in dingy-hooded gar-
ments came near leading a few goats he
sold the milk to the convicts and when asked
produced packages of cigarets playing cards
and newspapers these last were a month
old and tattered chaptel learned that they
had been retrieved by the sergeants order-
lies and then sold with the sergeant asleep
low conversations started leading as usual
to scufflings and insults it appeared that
the convicts could not talk five minutes with-
out quarreling

  duval joined chaptel

  how did you make out last night

 chaptel told him

  hes an awful slob chaptel went on
youre all so ready with a knife up here i
wonder why he wasnt bled like the pig he is
before now

  we might get a worse one

  i dont believe it

  duval laughed shortly bichet it seemed
was considered a fairly good sergeant-major
he usually rested content with the initiation
and then left the men alone other sergeants
kept after them months on end

  and even among yourselves you dont
get on well i wonder why for instance
they stand for what you do duval

  same reason they might get some one
worse

  why dont they inform the authorities
about you and any one who succeeded you
why because its the rule of the place
that the informer be killed do you see that
chap over there he indicated hes due
for a sticker in his belly sometime he de-
nounced one of the costauds here the rest
of us have sworn to do him up did you
ever hear of the ace of spades

  the ace of spades

  yes a society-a gang existing in every
camp every barrack every prison through-
out military establishments stretching -even
to the civil penitentiary in guiana well i
belong to it no one not a member ever
hears of it all the costauds caids malabars
-gang leaders-belong to it

  duval bared his arm

  you see that

  he exhibited a small tattoo just above
the elbow on the inside of the left arm a
well-executed reproduction of a pip of
spades

  you could get money even freedom for
reporting this duval declared theyve
been trying to find out about this for years
practically since the creation of the units
the officers the sergeants all feel that it
exists those of the convicts who dont be-
long know nothing more than the stripers
then why did you tell me

   ill get you in kid no later than tonight
itll save you a lot of trouble

   i realize that it will help me said chap-
tel cautiously but nothing is ever gained
without something given in exchange what
will i be expected to do

  nothing much a fellow wearing this is
generally a tough mug and able to fight
but when he is transfered to a new camp if
he finds that the costaud belongs to the bunch
he doesnt try to oust him he says nothing
and shares on the graft if any man squeals
on the costaud the knaves of the ace of
spade get him thats why if you stay here
a hundred years you wont see another case
of squealing that fellow over there be-
lieves he got away with it hell find out
chaptel stared curiously at the doomed
man thin and short almost dwarfed he
wheeled a barrow loaded with stones he
held a cigaret in the corner of his mouth and
grinned out of the other corner probably a
half-wit but the costaud no more than the
mills of justice would take cognizance of his
lessened responsibility it stirred vague
unknown emotions in chaptel to see a man
to all intents and purposes dead walking
away with a smile on his face

  messaoud leaned close

  sergeant awake he whispered

  the non-com had unexpectedly awakened
and now came toward the two

  what where you showing him on your
arm he asked duval

  nothing much sergeant duval re-
plied he thought his forearm larger than
mine

  at the same time the sheer extended his
arm and nodded to chaptel to do the same
it is larger the sergeant declared
duval surprized looked down at the two
arms

  by- it is i hadnt paid attention

  chaptel caught something of annoyance in
his tone evidently the apache was proud
knaves of spades



of his bulk and did not like to be surpassed
even on one count

  what did you do before coming here
the sergeant asked curiously

  automobile mechanic

  youve got an arm like a country-fair
wrestler the non com stated ill keep
an eye on you ill bet youll be costaud here
within a month

  he pulled a metal-cased watch from his
fob pocket yawned you two get back to
work with big strong muscles like that ill
expect your piles to be larger from now on
contact between jailer and convict in-
variable ended unpleasantly for the latter

  that night duval led chaptel from the
tent in the moonlight the guard on the
scaffold stood out sharply duval whistled

  thats messaoud he explained noth-
ing to fear so long as we dont try to beat it
out of bounds

  he led the way to the huts where the
kitchen was installed inside a score of men
were gathered the knaves of the ace of
spade the head cook himself a convict
shut the door and lighted the lamp chaptel
was introduced and instructed in the various
signs and passwords then sworn to preserve
secrecy had he refused to take the oath he
would not have been allowed to go out alive
the melodramatic performance half-awed
half-amused him

  then using a card as a pattern a tattoo
artist marked chaptel with the brand of the
gang as the fellow worked his mouth
stuffed with needles chaptel wished that he
had not accepted duvals offer this tattoo
habit in the battalion in the camps was de-
grading and here he was undergoing the
rather painful process for the squalid privi-
leges to be obtained

   his initiation over the others ignored him
the cook produced wine cards were brought
out chaptel joined in and lost as the
wine took effect the crude formalities were
abandoned chaptel saw things that night
that threw a new light on the knaves and
on duval

  the time-honored song of the bat daf
rose-

trabadja la moukere

trabadja bonnol

  chaptel pulled the cooks sleeves

  the sergeants theyll hear

  youre young laughed the cook
theyre dead drunk by now i swiped this

absinthe from the table right under their

noses and they didnt move

  he brandished a half-filled quart

and chaptel saw the mixing of a strange
cocktail-strong red wine cut with absinthe

  the door opened a turco appeared
chaptel started up but the arab was not
on duty

  bonjour kruya he greeted the cook
good day brother have you a small bit of
sugar

  the usual blackmail said the cook

  he gave the turco a handful of lump sugar
which the native stuffed in the pockets of his
voluminous trousers he contemplated the
orgy placidly until his attention was drawn
to the card game he hesitated then
squatted down and asked that he be dealt a
hand net result he lost all the copper
coins in his various pockets a knife and a
silver watch no more than chaptel could
he cope with the sharpers he left scowling

  you better give him back that watch
duval suggested to the winner hell get
mad and shoot you when he finds you alone
if you dont you remember- he listed
several names

  ill give it back to him all right the
other assured him but ill coax a night
outside for it next time hes on guard
thats the idea duval complimented
then seeing chaptels tin cup still full-
youre not drinking-whats the mat-
ter

  not thirsty

  duval roared with amusement called the
others attention and repeated what he
called a good joke

  didnt i say he was a funny guy he
dont drink because hes not thirsty what
an egg

  two hours before daylight the party
broke up duval halted by the door for a
few words with one of the men

  tonight

  tonight

  thatll mean no end of a fuss and no
work in the morning

  back in the tent chaptel removed his
shoes and went to sleep the last words he
had heard had meant nothing to him in
fact he was too disgusted tired and sleepy
to fathom the meaning

  in the morning the groups formed as
usual and were about to move off when one
of the sergeants exclaimed-

   where is he


adventure

  there was an inquiry then the ser-
geant decided to visit the mans tent he
came out waving his arms about his head
in wild excitement

  hes croaked some one croaked him

  he ran toward the office returned with
bichet who wore only undershirt trousers
and slippers

  bring him out here i cant stand the
smell said bichet petulantly

  two men entered the tent and returned
with the body of the man whom duval had
pointed out the previousafternoon they
laid the corpse on the ground

  the skinny legs jutted out of the gray
shirt both hands were clasped around the
protruding end of one of the spoon-knives
his open eyes stared straight toward the
sun and his lipsstill grinned

  bichet scowled at the gathered men

  who did this

  no one answered 

  get back to your tents ill get after
you one by one

  but the sergeants questioning did not
produce the truth the companions of the
dead man remembered nothing had seen
nothing heard nothing yet the little fel-
low had not died immediately his hands
were bloody as if he had tried to free the
blade he must have groaned he probably
screamed but before the stolid denials
bichet was forced to give up a report was
made sent down to ain saffra

  bichet was like a maniac -- reigned

in the camp for the next few days tor-
tures were freely distributed chaptel
miraculously escaped his share duval
spent two nights naked in the pit and came
through the ordeal without so much as a
head cold the murder made the turcos
nervous they wounded a man who had
gone aside from the others suspecting that
he tried to escape

  when the next meeting of the knaves of
spade was called in the cook house the chef
had important news

  i was waiting on table he said for he
combined the culinary art with the task of
table attendant to the sergeants and
bichet was almost crying what do you
think he asked the others theyre bawl-
ing me out they say its the sixth in three
months thats true but how can i help
it do i sleep in the tents i cant know
ahead of time whos going to be killed can
i and theyre looking into the pneumonia

cases youd think this scum here was good
as gold the way they worry down at head-
quarters

   dont worry sergeant another pipes
up itll blow over like it always has
theyve got to justify their existence pre-
tend they earn their salt thats all

  but bichet gets madder

   dont worry- he yells you know

what they write me ill get a lieutenant
up here thats what you know what that

means -fool of a baby with a lot of

-foolish ideas

  but the others laughed

   dont worry they assured him no
officerll come up here its too far from
town and women 

  opinion among the knaves was divided
some believed a lieutenant would come
but the majority agreed with the skeptical
sergeant no officer liked the lonely exist-
ence in the hills

  wouldnt a lieutenant change things
for the better chaptel asked

  how could he

  the sergeants couldnt get away with so
much the officers dont graft on food
either wed get more meat more wine
the regulations state that once in a while
were to get sausages yet i never see any
save what the cook gives us when were to-
gether

  those are the regulations sausages
kid the cook said i keep them for the
real boys

  would the officer stand for the pit
chaptel went on

  no

  im willing to lose the extra portion of
sausage i get here to escape the pit

  the others glanced at each other du-
val scowled then instead of the sharp
words he intended to speak explained

  a lieutenant here will mean good-by to
us for the time the sergeants will stay
awake on the job and well have to work
moreover hell always be snooping around
trying to find out who is the costaud the
officers have it in for us its as much as
your life is worth to be found out you get
sent down to ain saffra youre asked a lot
of questions if you have any money hid-
den they find it and confiscate it for the
hospital fund

  then you get sent not to a camp but to
a prison sometimes you get two years in a
cell which two years dont count on your
knaves of spades



time here and they try hard as they can
to pinch a murder on you to send you to
guiana no the officer aint good for us

  theres always a way of getting rid of
him suggested the cook

  even that aint safe they make a fuss

about a convict but a -of a lot more

about an officer

  if the worst comes to the worst the
cook can stew a few laurel leaves in his cof-
fee volunteered another

  the taste gives it away and what if
they took the body for autopsy id be ripe
for the widow-the guillotine the cook
said

  thats so duval concluded lets
hope he dont come

the lieutenant fell into camp
like a bolt from the blue

  he arrived at three in the
afternoon after a short inter-
view with bichet he sought out the labor
gangs on the hillside

  chaptel saw with glee the change on his
non-coms face when the officer shook him
awake

  is that the way you give your men an
example of industry a third of your men
are loafing while the others do the work
ive been watching for the best part of an
hour

  the sergeant buttoned his coat saluted
his face became redder and redder until
chaptel feared it would burst open like an
over-ripe tomato

  i beg your pardon lieutenant

  all right-all right you cant be ex-
pected to show zeal the sergeant-major
gives the keynote i suppose

  the lieutenant was a tall wiry young
man between twenty-two and twenty-five
he was blond with a small mustache cross-
ing his tanned face a face lighted by a pair
of resolute eyes his uniform was elegantly
cut and he carried himself well even with
this aristocratic appearance he managed
to convey to the convicts that he under-
stood them instead of barking orders as
did the sergeants he merely motioned for
them to gather in front of him

  theres been a lot of queer business in
this camp he announced thats over
i know its useless to try to get at the bot-
tom of the killings but if its possible i
intend to prevent the repetition i wish
you fellows to understand that it is to your

interest to behave yourselves after i have
passed three months here ill draw up a list
of worthy cases and submit it to my supe-
riors recommending the best for rehabilita-
tion for pardon

  you can make this job of mine easy or
hard its up to you i can only say that
i have my work to do as you have yours
it will be best if we pull together

  he indicated the road the rockpiles

  i have consulted the papers left by the
various inspectors this road hasnt ad-
vanced a mile in two years that is why
you regard it as a hopeless task its an
insult to your self-respect to expect you
to become enthusiastic over a monotonous
grind the idea behind this road is not to
make you labor but to use your labor
you have enough rock broken up for the
moment tomorrow well change the
action a bit well clear the land ahead
he turned to the sergeant

  draw back fifty yards and wait until i
call you

  then to the convicts

  he can not hear have you any com-
plaint to make

  no one replied chaptel would have
stepped forward but duval pulled his sleeve
warningly the lieutenant waited for a
few moments then shrugged

  i know you have but you wont talk
i dont blame you when you know me
better you will go back to camp now
work is over for the day

  he walked away located his horse where
he had left it in the bushes following the
disgruntled sergeant the men marched back
to camp

  why didnt you let me talk chaptel
asked of duval

  because youre a fool do you think
that jewel will stick it up here long hell
go back before two weeks then the ser-
geants would learn who spoke

  in camp the lieutenant continued his de-
tective work again he called the men to
face him

  the regulations permit you to have
macaroni today is down as macaroni day
what did you get

  boiled beans said the cook
  yesterday

  boiled beans

  i saw the rations cut up for today cook
was there enough meat for each man
why were some mess tins better filled than


adventure

others no need to answer you have
special friends

  the lieutenant turned to bichet

  ill have the lock repaired on the sup-
ply shack sergeant youll issue person-
ally the supplies for each day and ill see
that each man gets a fair share any one
among you able to fix that lock

  no one volunteered the lieutenant bit
his lips paled somewhat and shrugged
again

  one of the sergeants stepped forward
  chaptel  is a mechanic

  chaptel where are you chaptel
  chaptel saluted

  here lieutenant

  why didnt you answer my demand

  i am a mechanic lieutenant not a lock-
smith

  you seem fairly intelligent though
theres a tool kit come over to the shack
and try your hand	

  chaptel followed respectfully a quick
examination of the lock convinced him that
he could repair it in a few hours he set
to work with screw driver and removed the
massive iron from the door he sat down
on the threshold and spread out the vari-
ous parts for inspection

  my name is olivier lespart volun-
teered the lieutenant

  chaptel looked up

  mine is edmond chaptel he grinned
or  if you prefer lieutenant

  edmond chaptel is sufficient between
us lespart assured him how do you
find it here chaptel

  his tone was friendly but chaptel was
wary

  so-so lieutenant good and bad mo-
ments as everywhere else

  the turcos had herded the convicts back
into the tents the sergeants had vanished
into the huts the two were alone les-
part produced a cigaret case and offered it
to chaptel

  have one he said youll work bet-
ter if you smoke

  chaptel wordlessly took the proffered
cigaret

  man to man chaptel forgetting you
are a prisoner and i an officer cant you tell
me something about what goes on here
you blame us for not helping yet you wont
do anything to facilitate our task we see
the outside of you men but have no idea
of your reactions your habits inside the

tents your obstinate silence is what
loses you

  dont blame the sergeants theyre
only men and in their turn when they were
new doubtless tried to do their best
gradually they get to hate you all realiz-
ing your lack of trust then the loneliness
the drink takes hold of them and you get a
bichet i know of a man who has just been
thrown out of the army a former sergeant
because he was friendly with his men and
they took advantage of it five escaped
and he was discharged hes trying to get
reinstated maybe he will do you be-
lieve that he will then treat his men in an
affectionate manner

  no lieutenant

  i have been in the battalion three
years lespart went on i have seen
hundreds of men and i am a fairly accu-
rate judge youre not prison game chap-
tel all that ails you is a quick temper at
times ill bet this cigaret case against
the spoon-knife you doubtless have hidden
somewhere that the initial cause of your
trouble was a quick blow given in anger

  the spoon-knife is more useful to me
than that thing stolidly replied chaptel
i wont bet

  he held up the lock-bolt snapped it with
his finger

  lespart laughed

  you and i can reach an understanding
chaptel im not asking you to denounce
your comrades i despise an informer
but were alike had you been lucky you
might be in my boots had i been unlucky
i might be in yours

  chaptel choked and his eyes prickled
yes he felt nearer to this officer than to
any one he had spoken with since arriving
in algeria had they met on an equal basis
they undoubtedly would have become great
friends and lespart was stretching out his
hand to him he sniffed uncomfortably
and worked savagely at the piece of
iron

  what goes on in the tents at night
chaptel

  you cant imagine lieutenant some-
times i wonder whether im on earth
sometimes i feel like vomiting my soul in
sheer disgust the smells the fleas the
bugs-and the beatings

  we know something of that but you
can serve every one here if youll suggest
what is lacking why the prisoners have
knaves of spades



such gloomy ways regardless of outside

causes

  they dont know how to play lieu-
tenant they dont laugh healthily most
of them never were kids they were hard-
boiled men at six vicious degenerates at
ten and thieves at fourteen nobody ever
took any interest in them you know what
sort of fatherly counsel one gets from
jailers

  chaptel laughed an old mans laugh
thats it chaptel i dont know my
kind doesnt know the poor the orphans
the brats of apaches and low women they
form a sort of small nation within the na-
tion they speak a different language obey
a different code of honor i it must be
admitted have eavesdropped on groups of
men to try to see whether i could learn
something useful they spoke a french i
did not understand

  prison argot made up of words from the
battalion the penitentiaries the prisons and
the slums old man hugo who shuddered
at the slang of the criminal of his day would
find something to astonish him here it
isnt one chapter he could write on slang
but books a library

  as he spoke he got up to screw the lock
back into place

  just to test it he explained ill take
it down again and finish

  chaptel marveled here was a striper
a man in uniform with twining braid on his
sleeves the representative of the crushing
system and chaptel did not hate him be-
neath the clothing was a man a real man
strongly tempered sensitively organized

  are any of the men interested in sports
lespart went on

  no theyre all fighters that is they
know a multitude of tricks gouging kick-
ing but i dont think theres one who can
box or fence or wrestle according to the
rules

  how would they react to physical recrea-
tion

  i dont know

  what you said about their not knowing
how to play struck me theres an angle
that might get me an opening into their
trust what do you do sundays

  work-or we stay in the tents

  did you ever play football

  i belonged to a team that played swiss
teams from across the border not a crack
team of course but fairly good

  then you can explain the game to them
by sunday ill have a ball ill send to the
zouave barracks for one dont say any-
thing precise about it but try to find out
whod like to play and who wouldnt ill
have this camp happy before im through
as for you ill see that you get work re-
pairing tools and little things no use
wasting your skill on the road by the way
mark out the playing field and put up goal-
posts

  yes lieutenant

  when you get finished with that lock
let me know

s sunday afternoon saw two teams
lined up for the initial soccer-foot-
ball game chaptel was center
duval goal-keeper all had eager-
ly grasped at this occasion to distinguish
themselves

  chaptels experience counted heavily for
his side he avoided the others with absurd
ease and trickled the ball down the field
toward the goal to make the contest even
he held himself in reserve duval left his
post often leaped into the game and re-
gardless of friend or foe kicked the ball
he had no comprehension of team play
and neither did any one else

  the losing aggregation passed from en-
thusiasm to sullen determination the
smiles vanished from their faces and they
struggled as other men fight several times
chaptels opponent outplayed swung a fist
toward his head but chaptel ducked and
left his man asprawl behind him

  several fights started and were quelled
by lesparts interference the lieutenant
however could not be everywhere at once
one of the players suddenly was down
howling nursing his shin the skin was
gone for several inches the sufferer quit
then and there and chaptels team played
on with but ten men

  slow to learn the intricacies of the play
the convicts had discovered every possible
means of fouling before the game was half
over chaptel upon a signal from lespart
eased up and allowed the others to bear the
burden the result was a swift desperate
advance against duval who waited teeth
set brows knit but could not prevent a
goal enraged the apache dived forward
head first and smashed into the midsection
of the man who had scored

  the awe in which duval was held had


adventure

been forgotten in the heat of the struggle
and one of the men swung heartily for the
sheers jaw duval shook his head re-
covered instantly from a punch that would
have dropped the average man spun
around landed on his hands and kicked the
fellow under the chin

  that was a mere prelude to what followed
spectators rushed upon the field punched
bit kicked blood flowed chaptel who
had hurried forward to avoid the mix-up
reeled back with a gash over his eye just in
time to stop lespart

  dont go in there lieutenant theyre
mad they wont know you from any one
else

  i cant let them go on theyll kill each
other

  if you get hurt theyll all suffer better
get the turcos

  bichet and the non-coms wisely kept
away the turcos were sent for and ar-
rived at the double gun butts soon calmed
the most ardent duvals face was swelled
one leg of his trousers had given away his
big chest heaved and his eyes glared

  get back and try it again he chal-
lenged lets see if you can score now
but lespart had wisely decided to call off
the game this was the first and last game
of football played in the camp to the con-
victs sportsmanship was a dead letter
their self-esteem suffered from any marked
superiority when lespart arranged foot
races as less conducive to homicidal fury
the results were contested

  he tripped me lieutenant

  --liar dung filth

  wait ill bleed you like a pig

  one thing the contests accomplished the
breaking of the obstinate silence usually
maintained by prisoners before officers
chaptel saw that competition would merely
create new hatreds new jealousies he
foresaw that the time might come when the
champion runner might be knifed by an
envious rival	

  is there anything you men can do with-
out fighting lespart demanded
nothing said duval

  the games were ended

  then lieutenant lespart went into his
own pocket to purchase two sheep for the
camp and the prisoners enjoyed that un-
believable luxury-roast meat meat that
had not been boiled into fibrous fragments
for this gastronomical treat the convicts

were not ungrateful a delegation in which
duval figured knocked at the lieutenants
door and when he came forth in answer
addressed him

  in the abyss of misery in which we poor
outcasts wallow the spokesman said
using as do all batdaf men on festive
occasions ready made phrases culled from
socialist newspapers your generosity has
brought a ray of sunshine we thank you
from the bottom of our hearts hearts that
some may call heaps of dung but in which
the tiny blue flower of sentiment still blooms
we-

  all right lespart said with a smile
im glad you like it double wine ration
tonight

  lieutenant you are better than a
mother

  if any one ever annoys you another
offered just tell me thats all-just
tell me

  i will lespart laughingly assured him

  the group left and returned to their mess
kits the cooks brought buckets of wine
the tin cups were passed around drained
refilled a convivial atmosphere pervaded
the camp blows exchanged at the foot-
ball field were forgiven men embraced in
emotional outburst all in all the day was
a great success

  and what do you think of the lieutenant
now chaptel asked duval triumphantly
isnt he a regular guy

  duval his mouth full cleared his throat
with a gulp of wine

  hes a kid well get away with murder
while hes here so far he doesnt seem to
want to bother us costauds

  if you lay low and dont ride the others
i guess he wont chaptel said and i
guess the days of the pit and the beatings
are over

  lay low- duval said with a

soft fool like him therell be a lot for a
smart fellow to do and well need money

  hell tumble to tricks in no time i
talked to him the other day hes no soft
fool

  duval stared intently at chaptel

  i know you did he said shortly

  he munched in silence for some minutes

  wouldnt it be queer kid if he hap-
pened to know things he shouldnt know

 you think i-

  i dont think nothing-yet i just said
it would be queer
knaves of spades



   as he spoke duval dug his spoon vicious-
ly into the roast meat separated a sizable
morsel which he picked up with his fingers
and crammed into his mouth he wiped
his lips clear of grease with the back of his
hand

  it would be queer he repeated

lesparts first attempt at a
new order of things revealed him
ikmtfrni to be far from the soft fool duval
branded him

   his idealism was bolstered by a very solid
sense of reality bichet soon learned that
the orders he received were meant to be
carried out chaptel no longer went to the
rock-pile but wandered about the estab-
lishment doing odd jobs mending a roof
here a leaky drain pipe there the tents
were cleaned out and disinfected in one day
lespart found the spoon-knives and passed
bi-weekly inspections during which the
spoons issued must be presented chaptel
admired the common sense methods he
used

  although their lot was incomparably bet-
ter than it had been the men grumbled and
cursed the young officer for the privileges
he did not grant moreover lespart soon
obtained an almost mystic grip over the
turcos overnight they became almost
honest refused bribes or when they did
accept a bribe refused to grant the pur-
chased freedom the night meetings of the
knaves of spades were ended for the time
the lieutenant had formed an annoying
habit of getting up in the night and roam-
ing about the inclosure in search of prowling
prisoners

  on the surface all was quiet in the
tents trouble seethed becoming sure of
protection the oppressed members of the
aggregation refused to supply half of their
money to the various costauds the delec-
table dainties served by the cook to his
friends were no more the strong-man
stock chaptel remarked jokingly to duval
had sunk fifty points below par

  wait he laughs best who laughs last
the slicer said darkly

  remember the tale of the iron pot
against the earthern pot the lieutenant
is iron were earthenware

  well see well see its all right as
long as he doesnt come out openly against
us leaders

  if he knew he would-

  duval peered at him keenly bared his
teeth in a sort of snarl he was not pleasing
when he did this chaptel remembered the
murdered old woman the stiff-legged in-
former and the vague fan toms of five men
duval boasted of having sent to a bet-
ter world he shuddered not so much be-
cause he loathed the man he called friend
but because of the fact that he still liked
him he was inclined to think that some-
thing perverted had crept into him when
he could share bread and wine bucket with
a self-confessed assassin

  kid duval said once more youre
getting too fond of that officer for my liking
i usually stand for no such thing from my
pals take warning

  chaptel versed in the ways of his sur-
roundings shrugged spat on the ground

  duval seemed to harden and gathered
himself as if about to leap alarmed chap-
tel clenched his fists felt his heart thumping
against his ribs and knew that he paled
but the slicer finished with a laugh

  youre all right kid i was teasing
you

  the influence of lespart a clean man
was taking effect on chaptel the tyranny
exerted by duval over the others in the
tent irked him when he heard the sicken-
ing thump of fist on flesh the groans and
stifled screams as the slicer asserted his
mastery he found himself vibrating with
indignation once or twice he speculated
on his chances against duval or any other
he had been a mere boy a few months ago
but he had grown large and strong but he
stilled his desire fought against slithering
into the universal attitude of the camp-
admiration for brute strength

  one night after the last round by the
sergeant when the majority of the men were
asleep duval felt thirsty he lighted a
candle filched for him by the cook and
proclaimed his wish no one rushed for-
ward as was the custom with a filled con-
tainer duval was enraged he reached
out grasped the arm of the man nearest
him

  whos got wine

  i dont know

  get up and look bring it to me

  the others had awakened in the vacil-
lating glow of the candle chaptel saw the
drawn faces the trembling lips the man
detailed to search for the wine went from
one bed to another at last he found a full


adventure

pail he seized it without protest from the
owner and offered it to duval the costaud
drank until he turned the pail bottom up
he should have been satisfied and a sigh of
relief breathed through the tent

  but duval arose tightened his belt the
two quarts of wine had taken no visible
effect he did not stagger but his eyes
blazed more than usual he licked his lips
slowly without saying a word he made for
the man who had hidden the drink from
him as he walked his shadow huge and
distorted moved against the dingy cloth
wall

  the man whose guilt had been to keep
for himself wine carefully hoarded from the
daily rations got up and cringed back star-
ing fascinated

  i wont do it again duval he prom-
ised

  you bet you wont

  i thought some one else would give you
wine

  my self-respect what of it am i the
costaud or aint i

  and the slicer leaped forward in his
hands the man was a feather he twisted
him about slapped him threw him on the
ground the beaten man dare not cry out
for a cry might have brought the turcos
he stifled his groans tears of pain ran
down his cheeks he made no attempt to
fight back

  let go oh let go

  duval gave a last wrenching pull on his
arm there was a muffled crack a bone
was broken duval surprized released his
hold and stepped back but he was un-
willing to admit having overstepped his
rights

  serves you right you sneak he said

  he came backto his cot blew out the
light and soon was snoring chaptel heard
the man groaning in the darkness but no
more than any one else did he find the
courage to go forward and speak to him

  in the morning the fellows arm was dis-
covered to be swelled and useless lespart
decided that he should be sent to the hospi-
tal in ain saffra from the sufferer he
could learn nothing from his comrades
no more he questioned chaptel asked
him in the name of past favors to give him
a hint as to the identity of the costaud
chaptel reminded him of his own stated
opinion of stool-pigeons

  all right ill get the truth myself

  the next day instead of being taken to
work the men were gathered before lespart

  a man has been hurt he said i am
perfectly aware that there are men low
enough to take advantage of weakness you
call them costauds their right name usual-
ly can be found branding their occupation
before they came here the sole difference
is that here they live off men im going to
root them out the fellow im after is the
one who broke this mans arm

  i know that it is dangerous for you to
talk much as you would wish to above
all i dont want any more killings in
there- lespart indicated the room he
used as an office-in there are sheets of
paper each bearing a list of the men in the
tent where this accident occurred on
the table there is a pencil next to it a
box i want you one by one to enter the
room no one but myself can see you and
only from the back i want you to mark a
cross opposite the name of the man who did
that trick then youll fold the paper and
slip it in the box

  he signaled sergeant-major bichet to
call the roll one by one the men entered
then came out again chaptel took his
turn alone in the room he tried to puzzle
out the lieutenants scheme

  lespart must know that no prisoner
would betray the costaud even with ap-
parently no chance for discovery although
they could not get along peaceably with
each other they banded together against
the outside the papers were not marked
he assured himself neither on jthe front or
back he folded the sheet without making
the requested cross and slipped it into the
box

  duval went in soon after saluting meekly
as he passed lespart when the proceed-
ings were over the gang-sergeant led the
men to work all save chaptel who was
installing a system of gutters to catch rain
water for the laundry

  very soon lespart came from the office
grinning

   i know who did that thing last night
   yes lieutenant

  that brute duval

  chaptel went on hammering for a mo-
ment then he looked up and faced the lieu-
tenant candidly

  ah you think so

  yes i think so  he had a jocular
way of addressing chaptel by his number
knaves of spades



which was far from making the prisoner feel
degraded you know im right

  i know nothing except that this is no
day for me to be seen talking to you

  i understand

  he left immediately

  chaptel wondered how lespart had ar-
rived at this conclusion he felt certain
that no one would betray duval the risk
would be too great

  duval returned with the others he sat
next to chaptel at meal time eating
heartily pail between his knees he spoke
of the events of the day

  say he exclaimed suddenly wholl
pull a long face tonight that long-nosed
friend of yours thought he could find out
something by that paper trick

  chaptel hesitated should he warn du-
val but in so doing he would betray him-
self make it known that he had conversed
with lespart on an even footing an un-
guarded word to the sheer at this time
might be dangerous he remained silent

  summoned again before the lieutenant
the men exchanged ironical glances duval
winked at chaptel

  i told you id find the guilty party
said lespart and i have

  duval did not quiver doubtless he
reasoned that the officer was bluffing

  a costaud is always a coward thats
a rule and a coward never loses an oppor-
tunity to insult a man he would not have
the guts to speak to face to face i gave
him the opportunity i am explaining
everything fully so that not one of you may
be accused of squealing there is such a
thing as invisible ink if youd paid careful
attention to me instead of calling me names
beneath your breath youd have noticed
that i had you go into the room according
to roll-call which makes numeration easy
after you had gone i picked the papers out
of the box only one was marked a few
words written clumsily a disguised hand-
writing the words not complimentary to
me i decided to find out who had been so
rude a candle on the invisible ink-and
the number i took the roll and counted
the names who could wish to insult me
the man i was after simple eh

  chaptel without moving glanced out of
the corner of his eye the slicer was pale
but smiling he was keeping up a good front
moreover he was not convinced that he was
identified his last doubt was soon removed

  mesaoud bring achille duval here
messaoud gravely came to duval and
conducted him forward

  here you are lespart greeted him
and you dont seem very sure of your-
self i have called you a coward i repeat
it your breed disgusts me as it would dis-
gust any man with a stomach look at
him you men who refused to betray him
isnt he a brave man the little fellow
whose arm he broke had probably done
much less to him than call him a coward
he dare not touch me because to touch me
means the firing squad he tortures men
has killed men yet fears death himself
duval blanched

  you gold-braided swine he said firmly
loudly a sergeant taunted me until i
struck him of the two of us who is the
greater coward you who dare me to
touch you at the risk of my life or me the

convict with all your - machine ready

to squash me if i am what i am its your
kind that did it dare me again and ill
throttle you thats what i am-achille
duval the slicer

  youre a bully but not a coward said
lespart

  both had courage duval to talk back
lespart to admit a mistake before the men
around him he felt a surge of enthusiasm
not for the officer but for duval these
men whom the slicer had oppressed were
now proud of having been his slaves a
low murmur of approval rippled and all
of them with the exception of chaptel
hated this young man who was arresting
their hero for their good

  lespart beckoned to sergeant-major
bichet

  place him in irons

  yes lieutenant frog-tie him too
  no

  thank you lieutenant duval said
suavely by the way what am i arrested
for what has been my sin

  here lespart made a grave mistake an
older man would have stood by his first
statement would not have engaged con-
versation with the prisoner

  youre under arrest for breaking that
mans arm

  i beg your pardon mon lieutenant-
when occasion demanded duval could ex-
press himself with elegance-you may
arrest me on suspicion thats your right
but please do not consider me guilty as


adventure

for the slip i do not admit having written
it it is very very possible that the sheets
were shifted he gestured widely so
many men handled them and no one is
infallible save his holiness the pope

  this was a crucial moment if the lieu-
tenant discussed the matter further duval
would argue and evade and each clever
reply was a point in favor with the other
convicts between the officer from another
strata of society who wished them well
and who was going to unnecessary trouble
for their sakes and the slicer who was of
their class and tyrannized over them their
choice was made one and all they would
stick to duval the psychology of it who
can fathom the abnormal brain the phre-
nometer has yet to be invented

  lesparts small mustache bristled each
hair apparently straining forward his eyes
narrowed when he spoke his voice had a
strange metallic quality

  i have a perfect right to clamp you in
prison with or without reason im begin-
ning to believe thats the right course to
follow with you irons pit irons pit i
have been unable to explain to your satis-
faction why i am locking you up youll
have plenty of time tonight to think it over

  i always knew that your fine promises
of justice would end in this manner duval
said intrepidly i presume you will also
prevent me from stating my case in writing

  lespart smiled

  not at all ill take your protest to ain
saffra im going down there tomorrow on
other business bichet take duval to jail
the rest of you dismissed

  on the afternoon that the lieutenant left
the gang-sergeants sought the customary
shady spot that the officer would never
come back was the general belief he was
said to have taken a run-out powder
to have fled from the loneliness of the place
where he mingled neither with the sergeants
nor the prisoners chaptel himself was
gripped by this popular belief

  the costauds settled accounts with those
who had murmured against authority who
had refused a service due from a loyal serf
to a baron of the large muscles before twi-
light came upon the hills faces minus
blackened eyes swollen noses and bruised
ears were the exception yet in spite of
the disorder a little thrill of relief pervaded
the camp with lespart actual suffering
had been lessened but other things had been

missing principally the complicity of the
turcos and the laxity of the sergeants

  bichet immediately absorbed several
drinks his eyes gleaming nose outthrust
belligerently above his thick mustache he
set out to assert himself

  chaptel was leisurely laboring on minor
repair work-plugging a hole in a tin pot-
when a formidable shock sprawled him face
down into the dirt he gained his feet
saluted the sergeant and dusted his cloth-
ing bichet agog with concentrated mirth
watched him

  eh eh our model prisoner how have
you been my dear boy havnt seen you
to speak to for ages

  very well sergeant chaptel then
risked a joke you have lost no strength
yourself what a heavy visiting card

  bichet was appreciative

  you spring good ones sonny well
now that your friend is gone what are you
going to do i hold it from very good
source that the lieutenant has been assigned
to a company leaving for the sahara so
youll be all by your little self ill try to
keep you busy

  thank you sergeant

  bichet braced his feet wide apart and
swayed back and forth hands clasped be-
hind his back

  i have several plans for reform in mind
he declared as has been the custom ill
discuss them with you now the prisoners
will receive salaries equal to non-coms a
three-course dinner good wine i intend
to construct beautiful spacious dormitories
twice a day i and my comrades will line
up and allow you all to kick us isnt that
a program

  i have also written to the president of
the republic and to the minister of war
suggesting various rewards for long service
prisoners who stay with us ten years will
receive the military medal and a pension
for twenty years the legion of honor no
more brutality kindness to be the rule
see i am even kinder than the lieutenant
but all this bichet added with great show
of courtesy is still uncertain for the
future

  without warning he struck chaptel in
the face cutting his lips

  the prisoner wiped the blood away and
saluted

  youll do me the pleasure to drop that
job youre playing at bichet went on
knaves of spades



and trot down to the rock-pile select a
hammer and get to work i like palms
hardened by honest toil yours are getting
as soft and pink as those of a young lady
brought up for marriage

  yes sergeant

  you run very well i saw you the day
of the games make that clump of trees
in thirty seconds or the pit tonight and
your skin for a nightshirt

   chaptel held his cap in one hand and sped
for the clump of trees indicated the fear
of the sergeants wrath gave him unknown
speed although he slowed down to a
moderate walk as soon as he was out of
sight of bichet he was still panting when
he found his tent mates they were sur-
prized to see him and spared him neither
caustic comments nor cutting allusions to
his misfortunes

  good-by soft snap

  his ittle friends gone no one loves
him now said big mary a tall slender
youth

   chaptel after a glance to assure himself
that the sergeant was not watching
knocked big mary down with a open hand
blow swinging a hammer he faced the
others they saw that he was angry enough
to use the tool and subsided

  i guess youll get thick with duval
again some one volunteered believe
me its better to pick your friends in the
tent who gave you that smash

   i fell

  messaoud strolling near suggested that
he better work

   he was kept on the rock-pile three days
then news reached camp that lespart
had refused an assignment with combat
troops and would come back to the hills
it was bichet who received the official
announcement

   bichet called chaptel into his office ap-
plied various ointments to his bruises

  go ahead with the work the lieutenant
gave you he said between ourselves
i think you better keep your mouth shut
he may go away again for good remem-
ber i never forgot either a dirty trick or a
lavor

   ill be dumb sergeant

   thats right 

  when will he be back

   in four or five days

  when chaptel went for his food the cook
leaned close and whispered

   

  kitchen tonight after the last roll-call
messaouds on guard the sheer will be
there

  hes in irons

  trust me

        the cook made good his word
w-j-s duval was there when chaptel
reported at the meeting of the
knaves

  bichet and the sergeants were drowning
their disappointment in absinthe had been
since four in the afternoon to filch the
keys from the semi-conscious man had been
an easy matter for the cook chaptel
strongly suspected that the culinary artist
had added certain ingredients to the mens
coffee not mentioned in the receipt-book
messaoud had forgotten his newly acquired
principles before the offer of a kilo of sugar

  hello kid duval said extending his
hand	

  hello how are you making out

  the slicer laughed

  im used to it all in all i must have
spent the good part of a year in irons

  then the usual songs were sung the cus-
tomary drinks served but chaptel felt
that something important would be decided
before the meeting broke up the cook was
fidgeting duval was more nervous than
he cared to admit often a hush fell over
the gathering during which time the men
stared at each other without words

  lets get down to business duval said
at last

  his dominance was pronounced his
courageous reply to lespart had branded
him not only a strong man but a daring
champion he propped his elbows on his
knees nursed his chin in the palms of his
hands chaptel again was fascinated by
the massive face the hard eyes

  about lespart something must be
done the slicer stated hes coming
back here hes found me out and its
only a question of time before he finds us
all out and tumbles to the meaning of the
ace of spades

  you were foolish to write what you did
on the paper chaptel offered

  that aint the question kid its not
what i did but what were going to do
you fellows are no wiser than me are you
hell find some way to get under your skin
lespart aint the sort to be scared by warn-
ings hes a stubborn ass proof of it hes


adventure

coming back for myself i fear nothing
he cant prove i broke that fools arm at
the most ninety days in a cell one lives
through it

  thats a lot of talk muttered the cook
are you scared to tell us what youre
hinting at

  no weve got to settle lespart
theres only one way

  only one way the others agreed

  got the deck of cards duval asked
  the greasy pack was produced

  ace counts highest stated the slicer
to avoid possible controversy after the cut-
ting go to it chaptel

  chaptel cut without trembling he felt
strangely indifferent but he breathed
easier when he held up a two-spot
youre out-next

  what about yourself duval one of
the knaves remonstrated

  me how could i ill be in irons
the cook cut a queen he mopped his
shaven cranium nervously only when an
ace was cut did his hands cease shaking
at last every one was eliminated except
two men who had cut aces a second cut
decided the question the unlucky man
accepted his lot quite calmly woolen-
leg as he was nicknamed was serving his
thirteenth year in the penitentiary being
unfortunate when he chose to punish a
balky serf a sergeant usually appeared he
had a flat face his eyes were colorless and
his skin shone like a mirror

  its my business he accepted ill do
it but ive got to be told when where and
how

  when duval mused as soon as
possible after he comes back on the first
moonless night therell be no getting per-
mission from the turcos in a big mess
theyd squeal where lets see

  he was silent for several minutes

  he always gets up around three in the
morning and snoops around between the
tents to make sure some one will watch
you cook when he comes out of his hut
you can hoot once woolen-leg will slide
out and lay for him in the far tent two of
you will start arguing loud he wont
watch himself but will run straight for the
trouble you know him thats all

  is it woolen-leg asked scornfully
do you think i can get him with my bare
hands hes no weak sister and packs a
gun and he took away our stickers

  the cook will give you one

  me never howled the cook id
be accused of it

  sure you would unless you fixed it this
way stupid duval said two three days
before the thing tomorrow if you want yell
like blazes say some one pinched your bacon
hacker all the time youve got it hidden
away where you can put your hand on it
youre not such a fool that you cant get it
to woolen-leg on the quiet

  id prefer not to have anything to do
with it the cook said ill get the irons
for losing the knife

  wed all prefer duval said with heavy
sarcasm thirty thousand francs income a
mansion on victor hugo avenue woolen-
leg is not kicking why are you

  oh me woolen-leg put in modestly

one more or less-

  after its all over therell be-to pay

duval went on well have gendarmes
captains lieutenants judges up here i
have been in a camp before when an officer
got removed you better have your stories
ready and stick to them there wont
be no torture to make you own up the
newspaper boys will come up from algiers
oran and even paris but the judges are
tricky and theyll try to catch you if any
one tells you that he knows you didnt do
it but was there any talk of it before it hap-
pened say no the lieutenant was such a
regular guy that no one wished to hurt him
it must have been an outside job better
question the natives in the village thats
the way it was worked before the time i was
telling you about they got the brother of
the officers native queen and gave him
twenty years for luck

  i guess it will sort of cool off the rest
woolen-leg remarked lespart with a
kitchen knife in his belly

  chaptel who had been sitting dumbly in
his corner accepting all this free talk about
murder without emotion shuddered

  he recalled the stiff legs of that other
emerging from the dingy gray shirt more
than this he feared the long days of expec-
tation when lespart would speak to him
offer him cigarets joke and all the time he
chaptel would know that he was as good
as dead

  and that conclusive night in the tent
when he would listen for the cooks signal
when he would hear woolen-leg making
his furtive way between the tents there
knaves of spades



would be a cry a scream but no one else
would pay any attention the turco on
the scaffold might shout a question then
forget about it and chaptel would he
between the blankets sweating cold until
bichet discovered the corpse during the
morning round during that night chap-
tel felt he would lose the last shred of self-
respect he would be guilty of conspiracy
to murder everything that happened to
him from then on would be deserved

  lespart had treated him like a man
whatever light there had been in his life
since he left france had been due directly
to the lieutenant chaptel imagined the
roles reversed he chaptel the officer
lespart here in the kitchen listening to the
planning of a cold blooded murder what
would lespart have done done he
would have stood up and denounced the
whole group for what they were scum

  caution whispered if you talk theyll
kill you not one of them would hesitate
to plunge a knife in your belly if you
talk youll get yourself killed and will not
change the course of events a bit and if
you keep silent and warn the lieutenant
no matter where you go theyll get you
and the lieutenant too one word of pro-
test now and all those sinister faces would
turn toward him he would be singled out
a marked man without a chance from that
moment his body would be found by the
outer fence no one would talk that would
be the end of it

- if he told lespart-lespart took every-
thing concerning danger with utter calm
he would not realize the gravity of the
danger lespart was of a courageous breed
was brave alone in the dark a bravery
distinct from that of duval who was brave
before an audience not so brave without
spectators one was a gentleman the
other a bandit of the two whom did
chaptel resemble the most it all hung
on his decision tonight

  it seemed useless to interfere don quix-
ote jousting with windmills was sane com-
pared to chaptel if he challenge the gang

   his mouth felt dry his scalp prickled he
was half sick with fear at the mere thought
of speaking he would never find the
strength

   lets have a drink on it duval said

  chaptel accepted the bottle placed his
lips where the others lips had just been and
swallowed absinthe almost undiluted

a dazzling light came into his soul that
night in ain saffra when charles and bibi
had found him he had had courage false
courage true but enough to risk anything
here in the glass container was bottled
bravery a bravery often despised but not
finding it within himself to be brave when
sober what was chaptel to do he coughed
once or twice but drank on at length du-
val took the bottle from him held it up to
the candle marking the level with his thumb 

  and i thought you could be trusted with
a bottle

  chaptel silently rubbed his stomach
already warm

  oh that the stuff might blaze in his veins
so that he could throw away his life without
regret without fear as lespart would have
done sober chaptel plus absinthe equals
one lespart a strange addition thought
chaptel for a lespart minus absinthe
did not make chaptel contrary to the old
school rule that a subtraction proved the
total of an addition

  a sort of gaiety came to him and while
the others conversed in low tones he sang

           pendant que chantait la fauvette

          ils sen allaient les amoureux-

          while the warblers were singing

          the lovers went their way

  he felt immensely sentimental lonely as
the broad ocean he recalled his mother
his father poor folks they had brought
him into the world watched him fondly
coddled him raised him to manhood and
all that would be made useless tonight when
he talked he recalled foolishly enough
the deep hole where he learned to swim
shaded by willows with the gaunt poplars
standing against the brilliant sky majestic
and complacent of all trees poplars were
nearest humans

  bravo chaptel duval applauded
after you leave here you can go into
opera

  i may not leave here chaptel declared
with a grin

  he was enjoying the joke he alone
knew that he would not leave the camp
ever unless one might call leaving the camp
to go to the straggling row of crosses in the
cemetery down the hill where the native
shepherd lads occasionally came to prove
their disrespect of christians

  christians here they were twenty odd
christians knaves of spades what a


adventure

pretty opinion of a race they gave the na-
tives what a wise thing for france to do
sending her wayward sons to represent her
in the algerian hills edification of euro-
pean virtues for the moslem natives bril-
liant brilliant

  he had stopped singing but another had
picked up and chaptel having given the
mood the usual entertainment of filthy bal-
lads was forgotten the big fellow in the
far corner chanted in a not unpleasant bass
something about two white oxen marked
with red a familiar peasant song

  the cook produced a last bottle which
was offered to chaptel in his turn he
gripped it eagerly and added to the supply
of courage of warm courage hiding in his
stomach 

  duval lifted his hand for attention

  the meeting will break up in twenty
minutes ive got to go back to the lock-up
before they change guards is everything
agreed upon the cook to supply the knife
two to start the fight and woolen-leg to do
the heavy work lespart must go

  he looked about him and then asked the
question invariably asked by all confident
costauds the question that chaptel had been
waiting for

  thats what i say who says different

chaptel rose to his feet

  i do he shouted

  duvals first reaction was in
in the nature of an anti-climax
the expected tigerish leap the thump of
fists against his flesh-nothing came the
sheer did not even get up he smiled
broadly winked at the others

  kid he said solemnly youre soused
as a pole

  not so soused that i cant tell you that
im fed up with your apache ways chap-
tel retorted but soused enough to knock
your head off come ahead costaud

  but the slicer persisted in taking the af-
fair as a joke he laughed gently

  go to bed you dont know what youre
saying i should have known better than
to let you in on this usually no guy gets
in who hasnt been here years by that
time theres nothing yellow left in them
knifing a man in cold blood is a dirty
thing you fellows cant do it while im
alive

  listen to the kid will you exclaimed
duval youd never think he once was

ready to bayonet a man for me would you
chaptel feared that if the discussion were
prolonged his nerve would fail him he
decided to hurry matters and have it over
with he was willing to be annihilated
but not to endure long suspense there is
a word in french to describe duvals pro-
fession a sad calling not easily forgiven
by men but counting among its followers
such distinguished names as that of the
duke of marlborough victor of blenheim
chaptel knew that to speak this word would
precipitate the conflict

  i was green then i didnt know what
you were sheer you dirty souteneur

  in a single move duval was on his feet
and lunging forward chaptel put up his
hands and with an uncertain sentiment of
happiness welling within him made ready
for the shock but the cook had launched
his fat figure between duval and chaptel
somehow entangling the apaches arms in his

  not so fast im responsible for this
shack and whats in it when youve
schemed for years to get a job like this you
dont risk losing it

  let go of me let go of me duval pant-
ed trying to throw him off

  not much

  the two were careening dangerously near
the racks where the sergeants china was
kept the sheer had kept sufficient con-
trol of himself not to hurt the cook and re-
luctantly drew back

  its got to be settled tonight he said
then added to the others thats grati-
tude ive been easy with the kid thought
he was green there he goes and sticks up

for that-lespart

  the sergeants are drunk messaouds
on guard whats to keep you from going
back of the tents asked the cook

  in the dark

  the cook threw open a shutter indicated
the brilliant moonlight

  all right send some one out to warn
messaoud

  a man left and returned in a few seconds
corporal messaoud promised to give orders
to the turcos that the prisoners should not
be interfered with unless they passed camp
limits

  youve got to be back in irons when
the guards change suggested woolen-leg
ill handle him

  not much messaoud will fix that too
lets go
knaves of spades



  they trooped out heedless of the uproar
they caused as they passed the sergeants
quarters the cook perfunctorily looked in
and turned away satisfied

  that was a good brew he said proudly

  behind the row of tents between the
shelters and the hedge of spiny bushes en-
closing the camp was a spacious clearing the
place once used as a football field some-
how the men in the tents had learned or
scented something important about to hap-
pen the turcos rifles in hand leisurely
approached herding the swelling crowd be-
fore them no one conceded chaptel an
outside chance against the powerful duval
but to see the apache in action any man
wouldhave foregone a nights sleep

  duval teeth set took off his coat and
shirt spat in his hands chaptel imitated
him swiftly knowing that the other would
not be above taking advantage of any delay
on his part

  the wind was cold and blew across chap-
ters chest and face he felt the vapors of
absinthe clearing from his brain yet ex-
ulted to find himself uncringing ready he
faced his opponent fists clenched head low
watching the heavy-booted feet

  to his and every ones surprize the slicer
did not repeat his famous onslaught he
appeared to respect chaptels ability as a
fighter unproved though he was evi-
dently he recalled the sergeants prediction
that the younger man would be costaud

  chaptel did not wish to attack to un-
cover himself what slim chance he had
he would not throw away to rush a man
as agile and powerful as duval would be im-
becility so for a full minute the two
circled around each other

  then duval sprang forward

  chaptel bent at the waist evaded the
flaying fists and shot both hands to duvals
face he did not know how to deliver a
punch had no particular skill in boxing but
the sheer weight of his muscular body was
sufficient to bring the apache to a stop and
drive him off balance chaptel followed
up the advantage with several blows to the
head under his tightly bunched knuckles
he felt the flesh give way he threw cau-
tion to the wind and dived in

  the slicer who had never given ground
before any man he had fought did not now
he leaned forward bore the punches and
threw his fists against chaptel blindly and
the younger man was amazed to find that

although the punches hurt they did not
have the withering power he had expected
he instinctively felt that he was having the
better of the exchange they stood head
to head swinging their arms the blows
drumming dully

  very soon chaptel lost consciousness of
the punishment he was undergoing and
knew only that he was hitting duval with
every move the forgotten lore of his boy-
hood fights came to him he took a step
backward and as duval shuffled forward
struck him behind the left ear duval
rocked almost fell chaptel felt hands
gripping at his shoulders knew that the
apache was trying to throw him down he
broke clear then duval kicked out vi-
ciously a long side kick aimed at the spot
immediately below the knee cap chaptel
sprang away lightly

  again they circled the sheer rushed
chaptel leaned back lashing with a right-
hand blow duval vanished from his vision
he felt a terrific smash against his ribs and
reeled back a kick-duval had landed a
kick his breath pained him his head
was not clear

  duval scrambling on all fours along the
ground gripped his ankles and threw him
down himself rising immediately to a favor-
able position for another kick but chap-
tel sensed the danger concentrated his
energy into effort and was up and out of
his way

  watch his feet chaptel some one ad-
vised

  chaptel needed no such recommendation
the one kick had come near to being the
end he was aware that once down he was
lost duval knew too many tricks of that
game for a novice to hope to cope with him
when the next kick came chaptel was
ready he seized the heel pushed upward
and before duval could rise found time to
stamp several times upon his torso

  fall on him get his eyes

  chaptel recognized the cooks voice his
successful stand had already gained him a
following duval was feared but not deeply
liked to see him humiliated by a young-
ster whom he had scorned would please his
victims the ex-costauds

  duval on his feet again staggered back
holding his stomach then he fell on his
knees chaptel eager to finish the fight
rushed forward his eyes on the muscular
neck where he would press his knee but


adventure

duval suddenly gripped him around the
knees and threw him having learned
that chaptel was as quick as he he did not
let him rise but squirmed his body about
holding him close for a long panting mo-
ment the two lay head to feet one on the
other the slicer was obviously afraid to
release his hold to seek a better one chap-
tel had one hand free his quicker mind
gave him the edge he grasped duvals
ankle and twisted

  duval screamed in a muffled way loos-
ened his grip dug the ground up with his
nails kicked out and freed himself the
two were up at the same time and the slow
circling began again

  of the two chaptel was the thinker

  while duval tried for a few simple finish-
ing holds chaptel was planning his battle
with method in the moonlight he could
see the sheers tattooed chest heaving his
flanks working like bellows the fast pace
was telling on him

  chaptel therefore made a running fight
of it he had suddenly remembered that
duval ate heavily and drank more than his
share the dainties prepared for him by
the cook would be his ultimate undoing if
chaptel could make the apache run after
him the fight was his the slicers vicious
habits would do the rest he wondered
why no one had ever thought of this before

  but this turn did not please the crowd
he was roundly cursed for his apparent
cowardice but he held to his plan duval
pursued him doggedly swinging his arms
kicking out chaptel watched him closely
did not try to retaliate and saved his
strength at one time he even turned his
back frankly and dodged away this was
comical and the spectators became hilari-
ous messaoud applauded-

  kif-kif oiseau-the same as a bird

  hell catch him-he wont catch him-
hell catch him-he wont catch him
chanted a wit

  this was more amusing than any one had
a right to expect a comedy with a certain
tragic ending the grotesque appealed to
the distorted minds duval was raging
and swearing when he halted for breath
chaptel teased him with faint rushes kept
him always on the move the massive
apache was drenched with perspiration

  his running gradually wore down to a
trot his arms swung with less vigor
when a blow did reach chaptel he felt it

merely as an ungentle tap the sting was
gone

  then chaptel set to work

  he aimed at duvals nose pumped
smashes into the sore spot as fast as he
could he felt the warmth of blood on
his fingers he shifted to the eyes and
pounded away the slicer made a few
ineffectual passes with his feet almost
tumbling with the effort he groaned
and spat blood

  kick him kid advised woolen leg
shamelessly passing into the winning side

  chaptel found a savage pleasure in bat-
tering that formidable face he pounded
the protruding jaw from all angles sharp-
shooting at the bobbing head as a marksman
aims at a bottle in the water duvals tre-
mendous vitality alone kept him on his feet

  tired chaptel paused duval stood in
place arms down head forward punch-
drunk

  had enough

  no

  duval somehow found strength to swing
his arms chaptel brushed them aside and
continued to rain blows he was begin-
ning to sicken but he could not leave
duval on his feet unless he admitted him-
self beaten and pleaded for mercy

  at last the slicer sank to his knees piti-
lessly chaptel leaped on his back pressed
him to earth bore down with his knee
against the neck holding duval by the ears
and rubbing his face into the ground when
duval stopped struggling he arose and
wiped his hands on his trouser leg he be-
lieved the fight was over but duval got
up on his hands then to his knees he
stood

  this was a ghastly nightmare chaptel
had to push him down again he remem-
bered how he had once liked the slicer his
old feeling of friendship began to return
again he rubbed the raw face into the soil
and released him again duval got up
the magnificent courage of the man the
courage he had often doubted appalled
him he wanted to flee from this sullen
determination more than he had wanted to
flee from death

  where is he mumbled duval with
both eyes blackened he could not see

  im here duval you better stop

  duval tottered forward

   ill get you yet

  chaptel could not summon the will power
knaves of spades



to strike him again he threw him down
heavily duval struck the ground with a
sickening thud sprawled out bloody face to
the moon and lay still

  satisfied chaptel found his shirt and coat
and donned them

  when he turned again duval had rolled
on his stomach was hoisting himself up
again a sort of hush had come over the
crowd they watched without a word of
mocking or encouragement how many
times would duval arise

  bhnd rage swept chaptel he ran for-
ward leaped upon his beaten enemy and
flattened him out then once again he
gripped the ears but instead of rubbing
the head sidewise he bumped it on the
hard soil once begun he could not stop
the nervous strain had snapped his com-
mon sense of decency duval must not
get up again that was all he remembered

  no one interfered

  at length chaptel stepped away half-
expecting to see that persistent dragging
movement but the slicer was done done
for that night at any rate several min-
utes went by and he did not stir but lay
sprawled out face down messaoud ap-
proached curiously-

  he croaked

  chaptel shrugged then he gestured
again to indicate that all was over the
cook ran forward

  i hope he isnt killed he said theyd
find out i let him loose

  he turned the slicer upon his back
duvals jaw had dropped upon his chest
from the mouth flowed blood and saliva
the cook pressed his ear against his chest
held up one hand for silence he looked up
at chaptel with a grip

  hell do

  do you think hes hurt much chaptel
wondered anxiously

  him youve got to kill a man like
that to hurt him hell be all right tomor-
row and in three weeks his face will be as
good as it ever was then he added ju-
diciously which aint saying much

  he called to woolen-leg and another
man

  help me carry him to the lockup and put
the irons back on him

  woolen-leg laughed

  whats the idea chaptel asked

  im thinking of the face on bichet to-
morrow when he sees how duval beat him-

self up all alone with claws and paws in
iron bracelets

  in spite of his disgust and weariness
chaptel smiled he was worried about
duval he dipped a handkerchief in water
washed the apaches face then he tried
to revive him but duval had taken so
long to lose consciousness he seemed to de-
mand an equal length to recover neither
beating in his palms throwing water over
his head or the uncorked flask of ammonia
produced by the cook had effect

  and so chaptel was forced to abandon
him on the hard sloping planking that
served as mattress in the lockup with his
wrists and ankles circled with irons

  the cook had waited outside

  come over to the kitchen i guess you
want to talk to us 

  chaptels speech was brief and to the
point

  you know what the fight was about
you better forget it i wont interfere with
you on anything else for the moment but
what i say goes from now on who says
different

  he waited no answer came

in lesparts absence bichet
drank all day and the longer part
of the night

  and the lieutenant returned

unexpectedly

  from another prisoner chaptel heard
what happened

  old man when the striper came in
duval was roaring with fever

   what ails that man the lieutenant
asked

   i dont know bichet says

   you dont know have you made
your rounds regularly sergeant-major

  bichet kind of laughed

   mon lieutenant he says astonished-
like am i the man to neglect my duties

   no no i cant say that the striper
pipes up bring a light i think hes
sick

  it was as dark as a niggers pocket in
there i hear bichet fool with a lantern i
see a match fuse up i knew how duval
must look so i didnt waste time looking at
his mug but kept my eyes on the officer
you know those eyes of his they seemed
to leap out of his head hke and that
funny wisp of hair he calls a mustache stood
up like bayonets on parade


adventure

   norn de dieu sergeant-major is this
duval

  youd have laughed to see bichet his
jaw dropped and those black teeth of his
looked like a stump fence he licked his
lips

   i think it is mon lieutenant

   hes been beaten the striper goes on
then i looked at duval and i almost
laughs out loud i dont know whether it
was the cold made it worse but duvals
face was all swollen and puffed he looked
as if he was sprouting mushrooms of differ-
ent colors you must have busted some-
thing high in his nose because it kept leak-
ing blood the striper looked as if he was
going to fall down crying

   its a crime an abomination he
bellows

  and i thought for a minute he was going
to wallop bichet the sergeant stepped
back	

   i didnt do it he says

  you didntdo it lespart picks up
you didnt do it who did then not
the other prisoners theyre in irons
youre the only man who has the keys
sergeant-major

  bichet was a sight he couldnt say he
had got drunk on duty and let the keys get
away from him and unless he said that
he stood out as the guy who had lambasted
duval

   its disgusting to beat a defenseless
man the striper said zharply you un-
speakable swine its men of your sort that
give the army a bad name

  bichet could only roll his eyes and say-
   mon lieutenant mon lieutenant
  then the striper turned to me

   you saw the sergeant-major do this
 i did not lieutenant i says it
was too dark to see anything

   did you hear anything

   no i sleep sound lieutenant

   facts speak for themselves the striper
said and called for water and washed du-
vals face he kept swearing under his
breath

   you hit him with a club he accused
bichet dont say different these arent
fist blows the poor fellows in pain

   give him morphine suggested bichet
eager to say something

   no hes excited delirious i fear he
has concussion or a fracture of the skull
the best thing is to send him to the hospital

poor fellow hell only get out of bed to face
court martial as for you bichet youll
be thrown out of the army and if this
man dies ill see that you get yours

  they took the irons off duval four
men came in to take him out of the lock up
he was still raving

  he was raving when they put him in the
wagon to go to ain saffra chaptel put in
bichet went with him

  thats a good one on the sergeant-
major

  yes chaptel agreed funny thing
how accounts are squared	

  later news came from ain saffra

  duval under treatment had recovered
quickly he had refused to make an accu-
sation nevertheless the evidence against
bichet was sufficient to cause the non-
coms dismissal from the army duval
himself stood trial for breaking a mans
arm the court martial condemned him to
an additional two years in a military peni-
tentiary at lesparts request he was
sent to another camp on the desert border
these two years added to the five he had
drawn for striking marietti gave a total of
seven as he had already served two years
in the battalion and five in the pen for a
former offense his minimum stay in algeria
would be fourteen years and if he met
another marietti he would never get out

  there were moments when chaptel
wondered if his career would not parallel
that of the slicer

  gradually he had acquired the swagger
and insolence of the costaud although he
never took money from his subjects he
drifted into lazy habits at the expense of the
others another man made his bed a
second washed his clothes a third hunted
fleas and lice in his garments when the
work was not to his liking he meted out
punishment but without duvals bru-
tality

  he had drawn away from lespart he
could not afford to be thought overfriendly
with the officer

  sometimes at night after an altercation
with a weaker man he feared to close his
eyes strained his hearing to catch the rustle
across the tent floor which would warn him
of a stealthy approach he came to know
the cold fear of a knife often he awoke
suddenly and brought his hands down to
protect his belly he spent glorious half-
mad half-drunk hours gloating over his
knaves of spades



power making the men perform antics for
his amusement

  he had experienced bad moments when
his authority was challenged and feet and
fists were brought into play

  his previous life sank into the back-
ground was forgotten

  whole months rolled by and he did not
write home what was he to write
could he give his parents details of his inti-
mate life was there anything in his ex-
istence that would bear the telling to his
mother could he write

  yesterday a man refused to clean my
shirt therefore i beat him

  more and more he learned to speak in the
slang of the pen words that had once
shocked him were the only ones that came
to mind when he desired to express himself
a quart of wine a cigaret nothing to do-
that was his ideal he had occasional con-
cern about his physical condition the
others worked on the rock-pile lespart
still allowed him to do lighter tasks about
the camp his biceps once hard and
springy were flabby the skin did not
seem to stretch over the muscles around
his waist rolls of fat appeared

  some night he knew there would come
an answer to his query-

  any one says different

  the man would be strong hard ambi-
tious and chaptel would go down to
take his place among the lowly to shrink at
a word to kill fleas in another mans shirt

  but the fear was not great enough to
make him work

  he lost consciousness of the passing of
time one day was like another twice
lespart went on leave twice he came
back a year and a half had passed since
duvals departure

  eighteen months-counting his time in
the battalion he had been in algeria twenty-
two months when he next entered the
barbers shack to have his head shaved
he paused before the mirror and removed
his long-visored cap

  his face was lined soggy there was
resolution but little intelligence he was
startlingly like any other convict now
the doctor would not say that he was dif-
ferent from the rest what a mug his
mother would have doubted his identity
had he seen such a face in france he would
have exclaimed-

  jail-bird

  what fear could not do a remnant of
vanity accomplished that night he made
his own bed examined his own shirt re-
fused the wine offered him

  resolutely he closed his eyes and tried to
forget the possibility of the knife he must
first conquer that particular fear the fear
that showed in his face it was an uphill
fight against habit-the hardest for a man to
win and he won the change in his ap-
pearance attracted attention he was
chaffed about his cleanliness and he man-
aged to allow the jokes to pass unpunished

lespart some time later
pausing near him briefly en-
couraged him

  i was giving up hope chaptel
you were going under-fast i was seri-
ously thinking of sending you to the rock-
pile for the good of your soul what came
over you no matter youre pulling up
good work

  thank you lieutenant i believe i
had the prevailing disease lack of interest
in life

  discouraged eh you know its the
most heartening thing to see you recover
chaptel had served twenty-four months
in the pen when lespart called him into his
office the officer was smiling and patting
a paper spread before him on the desk

  your case never seemed quite clear to
me i wrote to the authorities in ain
saffra and asked for an investigation the
civil authorities looked up charles and bibi
addresses found on them were traced let-
ters found duval had written his friends
about his quarrel with marietti hinting
that mariettis removal would please him
he wrote in so many words that you
chaptel would point out marietti to the
two men but that you would not help them
if you knew their full intent as is well
established by your trial you withdrew
when you understood the criminal plans of
charles and bibi

  marietti himself said you were not quite
sober the night of the attack he saw
you at the music-hall my superiors have
agreed with me that your case can bear
correction i am practically certain that
your sentence will be lifted within a few
months i think you may be expected to
serve a few months in the battalion of
that i am not quite sure the petition
signed by the major the doctor and myself


adventure

is before the commander in chief you
are aware how slowly such matters are at-
tended to but i can almost promise that
youll be out of this camp in two months
and home in eighteen

  chaptel groped for a chair his cap fell
to the floor he held his head in his hands
lespart more touched than he liked to ad-
mit breathed noisily coughed laid a hand
on his shoulder

  what the -  thats nothing

to cry over

  how would you feel toward a man who
had pulled you out of a quicksand

id promise him not to jump in again
thats promised chaptel assured him
im going to be a man some day thanks to
you if you ever need that man lieuten-
ant ask for him

  ill make a confession to you chaptel
im getting as much joy out of this as you
you dont believe it just try to play
providence for some one some time
chaptel straightened up as he recalled
that one night when he had played provi-
dence for lespart his debt had been paid
in advance and lespart had helped him
without knowing any cause for his gener-
osity

  the two men shook hands and chaptel
left feeling as if he treaded on air

  he sought his tools but his trembling
hands refused service he was filled with
sentiments which defied expression he
wanted to shout sing his head still swam
with emotion when five oclock came

  the cook emerged from his shack wad-
dled majestically toward him with a bucket
filled with potatoes

  help me peel these he suggested
sure chaptel agreed wondering what
he had to say

  they worked in silence for a few minutes
six new turcos have come to reinforce
the guards the cook volunteered one
of them brought a letter to messaoud who
gave it to me to give to you i guess the
guy who sent it didnt want it read by the
officer otherwise he could have mailed it
the cook cast a cautious glance about
ill slip it in the bucket you take it out
casual like

  chaptel did as he was directed secreted
the envelope in his tunic he put a two
franc piece in the bucket

  give to the turco this

  the cook turned away but chaptel saw

  that he licked his lips he knew what pro-
portion of the tip would reach the turco
the two franc coin would melt to a twenty-
five centime piece in the journey

  as soon as the night meal was over and
chaptel was alone he took out the envelope
the message was not signed it was badly
written sprinkled with mistakes in spelling
when deciphered into normal french it ran
as follows

edmond

i made a friend of you when i had nothing to gain
and much to lose by doing so remember how i
taught you to clean your things in barracks

  you ended our friendship in a cruel way you
humiliated me before everybody for the love of a
man who was not even one of us remember that
if i had given the word everybody would have piled
on you and finished you i wanted to go easy with
you not hurt you much just enough to knock some
sense into you you tricked me and won in a dis-
loyal way

  i got two years in this-of a place and it has

made me bitter if you thought id forget youre
wrong you probably told the striper that you
didnt want me in camp i was forced out of a good
camp to this hot place which is ten thousand times
worse than up in the hills

  i write you now because some of the turcos are
going to your camp its the first chance i have
had to tell you what i think of you this place is
breaking up weve finished laying the telegraph
wires as far as isallah i know ill be sent back to
the old camp and when i get there youll be the
sixth i warn you ahead of time so youll know
why it happened ill sleep easier after ive got

you you- you false friend you hypocrite you

- etc

  chaptel folded the paper then as an
afterthought set a match to it duval
coming back-soon-

  what could he do

the next morning chaptel went
to lespart

  lieutenant he said i
would like to be transferred
the officer seemed taken aback doubt-
less he could not reconcile this request with
his own announcement the previous after-
noon

 how where why you come and
fire demands at me without explanation
recall that a transfer at this time will com-
plicate the procedure to free you

  i wish to be sent to another camp any-
where i dont care much as long as its
away from here i have private reasons for
wanting this lieutenant

  i have no doubt lespart agreed
gently but how do you expect me to
knaves of spades



know if you dont tell me come on talk-
you and i are alone no one will hear you
i can not talk

  lespart pushed his kepi to the back of
his head aftd grinned he slapped the desk
jovially

  some inside stuff that messieurs the
prisoners do not want noised abroad eh
chaptel you had a quarrel with some
one i will transfer you to another tent
thats the limit of my power until i am able
to pass on the necessary papers you see
the camp in the south is breaking up and
contingents from it are overflowing into
other establishments it would be a dif-
ficult matter to convince the authorities that
you should be transferred merely on a
whim theres no two ways about this
either you tell me who has threatened you
or i can do nothing

  chaptel saluted

  i understand lieutenant he assured
the officer then he shifted to a routine
matter

  may i have  to help me today
lespart filled out an order for the ser-
geant in charge of -aliasgautier alias
woolen-leg-to permit that man to assist
chaptel for the day

  although the cook had preserved a vague
hostility toward chaptel woolen-leg had
proved his loyalty backing the new costaud
with the authority of his long term of
service in the camps between the vet-
eran convict and chaptel a friendship had
grown a sort of mutual respect a tacit
agreement to keep the others under con-
trol on the fine points of penitentiary
etiquette woolen-leg was matchless

  and so that afternoon chaptel broached
the subject

  duvals coming back up here

  then you better watch out he may
be sore over that hiding you gave him
hes a mean bird that way

  he wrote me a letter says hell knife
me do you think he means it

  he does theres only one thing to do
get him first

  i couldnt bring myself to to do that
woolen-leg shrugged whistled softly and
went on with his work he did not press
his point asked for his advice he had
given counsel this being disregarded he
had no further concern in the matter

  will it do any good for me to change
tents chaptel asked after a pause

  whats a few yards more or less to go
when youre after a man as for the tur-
cos you know as well as i do whether theyd
interfere with duval

  im half tempted to make a clean breast
of the whole business to the lieutenant he
might do something then

  woolen-leg looked at him coldly

  that wouldnt help much he might
jail duval or transfer you but youd get
yours just the same because it wouldnt be
duval alone that would be after you but
all of us me with the rest

  why what choice is left with me
why you give duval away and in-
directly it may lead to exposing all of us
the spades thats why woolen-leg
chuckled talk if you want no one
ever got away with it look at this

  he drew a newspaper clipping from his
pocket torn from a french provincial
paper

  a former member of the battalion had
been killed knifed through the back in the
cafe he owned woolen-leg produced other
clippings evidently he had a methodical
turn of mind as well as a keen interest in the
subject

   they talked thats what he explained
this affair of yours is between duval and
yourself dont make it spread

  i wont chaptel announced heartily
this knaves of spades business is like
putting your finger in cog wheels

  woolen-leg did not reply again chap-
tel took the initiative

  i wont get duval he said firmly i
cant get out of here by talking to lespart
thats understood there remains one other
way-escape

  to the coast the gendarmes would
nab you before you got far youre a
european and cant go through native vil-
lages unnoticed ill bet you dont speak a
phrase of arabic

  i dont whod have taught me the
turcos but were near morocco once
clear of the camp a nights fast march and
id be over the border

  then what

  id gain tangiers then america

  just like that- woolen-leg exclaimed
mockingly do you know what happens
to men who try to get away through mo-
rocco no the fellows over there chop
them up no joke me-me whos talk-
ing to you i saw with these two eyes the


adventure

bodies of a bunch of boys from the foreign
legion who had deserted with arms and
ammunition nine of them not far from
this place just this side of the border on
what is officially french ground those
nine boys were armed and could fight vet-
erans with medals they just went crazy
the way legionaires do and beat it how
many moroccans they got no one knows
but in the end-

  i guess i couldnt make it

  guess you couldnt do you know what
escape means thirst sun madness cap-
ture then an extra term for trying to get
away woolen-leg paused reminiscently
i tried it once

 when

  a few years ago a fellow was coming
back to camp to get me i got frightened
used to dream of him at night couldnt
stand it any longer but i didnt dare kill
him at the time i had never killed no-
body its the first one that counts i
managed to steal a bayonet from a turco
another fellow came along with a clasp
knife you know how hard it would be to
get out of here well that other place
down near the desert was worse we did
it though

 how

  who can tell we were crazy no one
saw us go we walked all night and slept
in the bushes all the next day the patrols
looking for us passed not twenty yards
away with darkness we managed to steal
a couple of blankets from the natives in
a village they were pretty white and at a
distance could pass for burnous we had
to bury our uniform caps and go bare-
headed we didnt dare go near the water
holes they were watched eat noth-
ing much a couple of dates thats all
enough to keep an arab alive but not one
of us

  after a week stealing a chicken here a
piece of meat there land once in a while a
drink we were so tired and hot we could
hardly stand my feet were swollen and
bleeding and we had sores on our legs from
walking through spines then we got
almost caught by a native goum-native
auxiliary cavalry-and had to hide two
days then we found an old guy an
arab with a little boy watching sheep near
a well the old boy held his gun on us and
told us wed have to pay for food i
managed to ask if we could have water out

of the well for nothing he said no yet
it wasnt his well it was everybodys
can you picture anything as mean as that

  i got sort of crazy then and jumped
him gun and all the thing went off and
tore half my right calf away but i put the
bayonet through his belly my pal had
caught the kid when i turned he was
laughing with the boy across his lap throat
cut and his eyes looked backward at me
we drank until we near busted then we
threw both down the well with stones and
sand in their clothing after we killed a
sheep and ate a lot cooking the meat over
the old mans fire it was only when i be-
gan to feel sick to my stomach and weak all
over that i bandaged that hole in my leg
with rags

  the other fellow was for staying with
the sheep near the well he couldnt think
of nothing else i knew that somebody
was bound to come and look for the old guy
and the kid and said wed move on we
filled a skin from the well-maybe it was
imagination but i thought it tasted of
blood-cut big hunks of meat from the
sheep and went on

  i managed to crawl bum leg and all
the other fellow got crazier and crazier
one night he tried to kill me with his clasp
knife shouting that i was the kid come
back i beat him up and left him there
i was fed up with trying to escape and
gave myself up when they looked for the
other fellow he was dead starvation and
hardship they said i drew down an extra
year

  what about the fellow who wanted to
knife you

  oh him i got him first nobody
ever knew thats how it worked out
youve seen a lot of things in your time
woolen-leg chaptel said flattering him
if you were in my shoes and didnt want to
get duval what would you do

  you can mutilate yourself cut off a
finger put out an eye-swallow germs
given you by another fellow whos sick
chaptel shuddered

  you can take a wallop at one of the
sergeants or at lespart youll get sent
down for trial but both ways bring you
back here after a while and put off the
time when you got to face duval theres
another way but you might not care to take
it get some sharp instrument wound a
sergeant then theres a big trial and
knaves of spades



maybe ten or fifteen years hard labor in
guiana guiana is no worse than here

after all except that the climate is--

rotten and a lot of guys escape from
there too many more than from here
there escape is easy

  ten or fifteen years-escape easy-

  then theres the trip its a big
change you see the sea you see south
america some people pay money to
travel like that but- woolen-leg
compelled himself to an honest statement-
its touch and go sometimes when you
wound a sergeant the court martials stiff-
necked and calls it military rebellion arms
in hands then youre stood up against a
wall

  my chief aim is to keep alive other-
wise id wait for duval id be willing to
serve fifteen twenty years rather than get
the slicers sticker in my guts you said
you dreamed about it so do i it gets
me sweating in the night all of a sud-
den just thinking you know how
it is

   we lead a life not fit for a dog yet we
like to keep on always hoping for a
miracle-as if we didnt know were due to
croak here

  did you ever know any one who got
away from guiana

  one fellow from here i knew i got
a post card from argentina hes a sailor
now and a fellow in my tent has a
brother in new york-you know in the
united states-who skipped out after seven
months

	theres such a thing as extradition
chaptel protested

  not for small fry youre no celebrated
apache or a well-to-do crook who murders
his girl your photograph wont be around
in every paper in the world for every cow to
look at neither will you be branded as a
dangerous criminal youre just a poor
bum that got away theyre almost sure
to say good riddance

  chaptel was tempted

  no use he said at length i wont
risk the firing squad

  i dont blame you i-- woolen-leg
broke off suddenly and smote his forehead-
i got it--wound a civilian they cant call
that rebellion and youre good for ten
years in guiana

  not a bad idea but wherell i find a
civilian none around here and any-

way i couldnt harm a poor fellow who had
done me no harm

  if you object to everything woolen-
leg blurted out how can i suggest any-
thing you want to get away but youre
not willing to do anything

  the conversation thus ended unsatis-
factorily and the two resumed work in
silence

  it is imagined by free men that a human
being of average intelligence and normal
instincts would prefer death to a long
prison term it is also imagined by men
in good health that should they develop
an incurable disease they might resort to
suicide as a favor to themselves and to the
universe but the sick man clings to the
hope of a cure the prisoner to the possibility
of escape or the miracle that will free
him

  chaptel decided as had thousands be-
fore him that life was worth living regard-
less of the torturing features he arrived
at this conclusion not through a logical rea-
soning but through instinct for self preser-
vation which seems to develop rather than
wilt in hardships

  escape from the algerian camp seemed
impossible woolen legs experience was
but one of many a single success he had
heard of a german youth enlisted in the
foreign legion stranded in the convicts
camp had vanished on a certain night and
had been heard from six months later it
was said that the imperial consul in algiers
had spent a small fortune in bribes but
chaptel had no such influence

  should he be able to get to guiana there
was a chance

  he calculated that duval would return
in perhaps two weeks rumors floating
about the camp combined to give him that
opinion he had two weeks in which to
reach a decision

  a week passed swiftly without new devel-
opment

  the rabbit thrown in a boa constrictors
cage a mouse between a cats paws doubt-
less undergo feelings similar to those chap-
tel entertained while waiting for duval
as inexorable as the shifting of day into
night was the persistent hatred of the
apache he knew the relentless patience of
the breed duval could hold back his hand
days weeks but eventually chaptels body
would be dragged out into the sunlight some
morning when he failed to answer roll-call


adventure

he lost his appetite grew thin
and haggard he relaxed into his
former slovenly ways lespart at
first tried to be sympathetic then
seemed puzzled by the sullen silence he re-
monstrated with chaptel even threatened
with a term in irons then he changed
tactics again chaptel was summoned to
the office

  i may have been wrong in telling you
of the prospect of freedom the lieutenant
-said the reaction of the first moment of
happiness is on you thats all your nerves
have snapped youre impatient you long
to be out of camp isnt that it

  chaptel who saw no purpose in denial
nodded mournfully

  i have a plan lespart went on
youve been around here several months
without even walking as far as the rock-
pile you need a change ill take a
chance give me your word of honor that
you wont try to escape and ill send you
down to the native village with messaoud
to do the marketing for my table and the
sergeants mess corporal messaoud will
not watch you-hell carry the basket
youre going for a stroll alone

  thank you lieutenant

   i merely want to make one thing clear
letting you out without authority from
headquarters is against regulations it will
pass unnoticed if you behave yourself if
you dont ill be in hot water

   you may trust me liejitenant

   i know it lespart shoved three five-
franc pieces across the desk take these
and get out have a good time heres the
list of stuff youre to buy be careful of the
eggs better let messaoud inspect them
before a light i prefer my chicken some-
what older

  flanked by the lanky messaoud who
bore only the bayonet and a capacious
basket chaptel passed cigaret in lips be-
fore the astonished sentry and strolled down
the road toward the village

  there was no use denying freedom felt
good even this limited freedom to try
the sensation of going where he pleased
chaptel left the main trail followed by the
imperturbable turco he grew drunk on
the sense of being his own man of not
having to glance over his shoulder for a
watchful sergeant hands in pockets jin-
gling the three silver coins musically he
ambled along he met the lad with the

troop of goats and bought a drink of fresh
milk

  you go down to the village often he

asked messaoud

  twice maybe three times a week

  youre a lucky man messaoud

  messaoud did not quite understand but
he did not question that was the good
point of messaoud he gave one a sense
of companionship yet did not interfere by
foolish requests for information

  the village was not exactly a metropolis
stone houses brown roofs emerging from
the rose-laurel hedges a group of women
coming back from the fountain at the foot
of the hill two or three children and in a
corner a white-bearded old man squatted
in the sun asleep save for the fleeting
glimpses from the train windows on the
journey from algiers to ain saffra this was
chaptels first sight of a village he forgot
his misfortune to admire the picturesque
aggregation

  messaoud who did not have the same
reasons to pause suggested that they shop
first then while he messaoud went to the
cafe chaptel might look about at leisure
chaptel consulted the list and then sought
out the woman who usually supplied the
camps military staff with fresh food

  messaoud although an arab spoke ber-
ber with sufficient fluency to haggle over
prices he drove bargains as if acting in
protection of his own purse rather than in
the interest of the government he asked
for a lantern and examined each and every
egg of the three dozens bought the woman
argued protested messaoud broke the
egg in question and invariably proved his
point

  from there they went to another house
to see what the turco corporal considered
the most marvelous spectacle in the hills
a jeweller at work pouring gold into a
mold chaptel had lived in a section of
france renowned for watch-making and
jewelry and saw nothing to admire and
asked messaoud to take him to the cafe
refusing the red wine offered by the native
owner he drank coffee and ate little cakes
with an unutterable feeling of luxury as
the cafe also served as general store he
purchased chocolate for messaoud the
owner of the cafe spoke a little french and
chaptel conversed with him

  the dialog consisted for the most part in
questions and monosyllabic answers
knaves of spades



 you know algiers

 yes

 nice city-big place-tram-cars

 big place

 i come from france big place too no
 oranges no dates you been to franee  
 no

 a pause then the inn-keeper asked-
 what they make place you come from
 chaptel reached out pulled the watch
 from the sash-belt around the fat waist
 make these

 yes the native rubbed his thigh
 placidly then rose and disappeared within
 the shop to return with a long-handled
 knife in an ornate leather sheath

 what men pay for this in france
 chaptel examined the curio

 ten francs maybe

 a man from algiers a european is due
 here they say he give me twelve francs
 sometimes fifteen for a blade like this

  is it old

 yes

 thats why

 old knife is worth more than new one
 then

 sometimes is the man from algiers
 here now in this village

 no he comes this afternoon
 soon

 soon wants to buy knives swords
 rifles all old	

 a collector of kabylian antiques and
 home-made implements chaptel surmised
 he must not miss him it would do him
 good to talk to a man of his own race he
 lighted a cigaret stretched out on the mats
 eyes shaded by the peak of his cap les-
 part had not told him to hasten and he need
 not return until the six oclock call

 he was willing to forego a meal to pro-
 long this seeming liberty the inn-keeper
 summoned his helper with a new pot of
 coffee and squatted gravely silent mes-
 saoud relaxed and jovial hummed to him-
 self on a roof not far away a stork
 strutted intensely white against the blue
 sky women laughed in spite of the heavy
 water jugs balanced on their shoulders and
 the sound was pleasing to chaptel starved
 as he was for the sound of laughter

 his day-dreaming was interrupted some
 one had come into the cafe a european by
 the step chaptel rearranged his coat placed
 his cap at the correct angle wiped his shoes
 with a dingy handkerchief this done he rose

to his feet and faced the newcomer the
face beneath the panama hat was familiar
eh well  how are you
sergeant bichet

  no not sergeant bichet-monsieur
bichet if you please you can not fail to re-
call that i was put out of the army although
i swear i didnt do anything lespart still
up there

  yes

  too bad id have liked to have gone
up and seen the boys for old times sake
but he never took to me much did he
how have you been you look older by
the way i remember your number but not
your name

  edmond chaptel

  yes well as you see they did me a
favor at first i didnt know quite what to
do in france i had no luck i came back
to algiers got in touch with a firm that ped-
dles stuff to tourists told them i knew the
lingo up here and am on commission ten
per cent of the profits look

  bichet went into his pockets produced a
handful of bills and coin

  a little better than fifty francs a month

what and no stubborn-to make life

miserable for me no weak sister to sym-
pathize with the down-trodden prisoners
i guess you found it a change all right
chaptel agreed dont you ever miss it
i remember you used to have a pretty good
time with some of us

  oh that kidding the newcomers i sup-
pose youre still a little sore about it but
-i dont mean this for you-its necessary
to get the jump on that cattle up there or
theyd walk all over you lets see what
was the gag i pulled on you

  you asked me how many persons in
god monsieur bichet and you put me in
the pit where the sick man had been
didnt hurt you much did it and you
realized right away who was boss saved
us a lot of fuss later now that im not an
official you see im not a bad fellow have
a drink chaptel

  sure

j bichet was not fond of coffee
and a bottle of wine was substi-
tuted -chaptel suave and polite
in appearance was revolving
thoughts that would have made the former
non-com uneasy but bichet was not a
mind-reader


adventure

  how long do you still have to serve

  a few years

  provided you live that long i always
thought you was mixed up with that duval
just an idea of mine the gang sergeant
told me you were thick with him at first
oh well lets forget it im a civilian now

  the word civilian struck an echoing
chord in chaptel if he attacked a civilian
he stood a fair chance of being sent to
guiana to guiana where men escaped to
go to sea or to settle down in new york

  bichet was a civilian quite a coinci-
dence that night in the pit he had won-
dered how long it took a man to make a
spoon-knife and he had been thinking of
bichet

  he looked keenly at bichets pockets for
a possible bulge denoting a revolver he
recalled that marietti had carried one and
bichet was of the same breed but the ex-
sergeants pockets were reassuringly flat
and there was nothing to fear from his puny
physical strength he picked out the spot
on the low forehead between the eyes
where he would send his fist crashing but
then a thought occurred-a beating with
fists would not be sufficient it might be
called merely assault he must wound the
man to make it appear an attempt at
murder

  he glanced about leaving bichet to
prattle on boastfully narrating in detail
several clever deals put through in this very
village there was of course the wine bot-
tle which would make a passable weapon
but it failed on two points in one case
it might simply raise a bump on bichets
head if the skull proved thick or again
crack that skull wide open

  chaptel desired neither the firing squad
nor the guillotine and bichets death would
mean one of the two strangling offered
the same risk too tight a squeeze and the
former sergeant might pass out a weak
grip and only finger marks

  messaoud after a grinning recognition
of bichet had turned his back and was talk-
ing with the inn-keeper his bayonet hilt
protruded and was within easy reach a
swift lunge the blade once in his hand a
thrust through the shoulder but mes-
saoud was wiry quick as a cat and would
prevent the appropriation of a weapon for
which he was responsible then a better
idea occurred to chaptel

  pst-pst-messaoud will you hand

me that knife i was looking at i want to
show it to monsieur bichet who buys such
things

  messaoud had been turning the knife
over and over in his hand scraping his palm
on the keen edge without looking around
he offered the weapon and went on talk-
ing chaptel drew the blade from the sheath
and gave the latter to bichet for inspection

  ill look at it bichet agreed the old
manll probably want too much for it
he glanced at the weapon casually not
a bad piece of work though you see we
tell the value this way-

  chaptel took a secure hold on the hilt
hesitated a last brief second it must be
done-sometimes men escaped from guiana

  he struck

  bichet stared and uttered a short grunt
not a loud grunt for messaoud did not
even turn around chaptel drew the blade
clear fearful that a second blow would
follow bichet rolled away with a swift
lurch to one side shouting for help his
left side was red

  messaoud faced about chaptel ex-
pected a blow from the turco or some at-
tempt at restraint but the corporal
grinned and buried his hands in his pockets

  no finish he asked

  calm now chaptel shook his head and
threw the knife aside lespart had told
messaoud that he had no control over his
prisoner for the day and he would not in-
terfere that was obedience

  chaptel suddenly recalled having prom-
ised good behavior what a manner to re-
pay lesparts trust but it was too late
now bichet was groaning with pain star-
ing in utter amazement

  no finish then we go back now
messaoud concluded

  the innkeeper had picked up the knife
wiped it clean replaced it in the sheath
then only he thought of bichet

  i go for toubib he declared and wad-
dled out of the cafe into the sunlit street

  without another glance at bichet chap-
tel followed messaoud and took the road
back to camp

the sinking sun spilled its red
glow on the wave crests flying
fish lifted and darted like a swarm
of gleaming arrows into the flank
of the combers in the sky sea-gulls
twisted and spun immensely free intensely
knaves of spades



white nearly a month ago chaptel had
left algiers bound for cayenne or saint
laurent du maroni in french guiana the
penal colony of the french republic

  looking out through the open port-hole
chaptel was happy happier than he had
been in many months ahead-he thought
he could already smell it-was the land
that land of abject misery guiana which
to him was the land of hope the land from
which men escaped

  hold number five of the convict trans-
port loire was neither comfortable nor
beautiful but it was free from smells and
vermin the ships doctor and the husky
guards enforced discipline and cleanliness
around this cage in which more than a
hundred half-naked men huddled ran metal
pipes which would spout steam in case of
rebellion little wonder that disturbance
on the transport was unknown no one
wished to be boiled alive

  in the cage with chaptel the majority
of the men were assassins and among the
number one or two celebrities there was
hulot chief of a band of chauffeurs-heat-
ers-who had terrorized an entire section of
france they would invade an isolated
farm tie up the servants and search for
money if they could not find it they would
seize the master of the household remove
his sabots and socks and toast his feet over
a blaze when hulot and his gang were dis-
covered and surrounded by gendarmes and
half a company of infantry of the line sum-
moned for help they had put up a spectacu-
lar fight somehow their courage had ap-
pealed to the population and influenced
by the general trend of sympathy the presi-
dent of the republic had commuted their
death sentences to life imprisonment

  hulot strong in the bloody prestige of
his past performances swaggered insolently
and accepted cigarets and candy from the
cabin passengers who were unhealthily
curious and eager to touch the hand that
had killed on his left arm chaptel had
seen the pip of spades and had learned
from him that he was a former private in
the battalion and a former inmate of the
military penitentiary

  there was also bouciaux a huge brute of
a man muscular pugnacious yet jovial
and kind-hearted he had killed a man and
a woman passionate crime the newspapers
called it bouciaux was the victim of a too-
sudden rise to fame five years ago he had

been happy as a cooper in the river port of
lyons singing at his work keeping time
with the mallet a visiting singer of con-
siderable fame had heard him been at-
tracted by his voice three years later
bouciaux was barytone in grand opera
making more money in one evening than he
had formerly made in a year simple and
rough he had become interested in a sec-
ond-class prima donna who to his unsophis-
ticated eyes represented romance things
went well for a while

  then bouciaux found that he had a rival
the lady in question doubtless expected an
outburst of temperament threats perhaps
a slap bouciaux doggedly serious was
uncouth enough to strangle his rival and
remove the prima donna from further par-
ticipation in opera or any other life had
bouciaux possessed a glib tongue and a
handsome face he would have been ac-
quitted with a tearful apology from an ad-
miring jury but he expressed himself like
a dock laborer net result-life at hard
labor

  bouciaux was the light and color of the
aggregation he sang in the stuffy hold
his voice may not have possessed the rich
tones once poured forth in a theater but
his choice of ballads appealed to his partic-
ular audience he had thrown out of his
repertoire the stately operatic selections
and had gone back to popular compositions

       jaimerais mieux croire au diable

tirer sur sa queue inusable-

        id sooner believe in the devil
        and pull his everlasting tail

  the men were of this opinion satan
was their patron bouciaux naked to the
waist a thatch of hair spreading like a mat
over his chest boomed similar songs in the
semi-darkness

  these men were not much different from
the men chaptel had known in the hills
save that the age average was higher with
his mere attempt at murder on the person
of ex-sergeant bichet chaptel could not
hope to take his place among the aristocracy
of this circle he was an obscure member
although esteemed by hulot as a knave of
spades

  hulot was of medium height and not
powerfully built but he was as quick as a
panther in action he was a strange mix-
ture of feline and reptile there was some-
thing cold-blooded terrifying in his ways


adventure

how much of this was real how much pre-
tense chaptel could not say but the fact
remained with the exception of bouciaux
all the men feared him even the massive
red-necked guard whose blue cap appeared
at regular intervals accompanied by a
jangle of steel

  this guard was in charge of all of the pris-
oners and had several uniformed men
under his orders to chaptels surprize he
was almost courteous in speech and during
the entire trip did not once use violence a
heavy service revolver bumped on his right
hip in a holster slung over the left shoulder
he was at once firm and gentle when he
had occasion to pass chaptel he softly
urged him aside with open palm instead of
punching and kicking as the camp ser-
geants would have done

  chaptel soon noticed that he avoided
speaking to hulot when he was com-
pelled to through the exigencies of his duty
he did so in an impersonal tone the guard
had his wife and a six-year-old son on board
the wife chaptel never saw although the
youngster often came down for a few min-
utes and stared at the convicts fearfully
once chaptel heard him speak to a sailor-
one of those men is going to kill my
papa

  nonsense why should they your
papa watches them because its his duty
why should they want to kill him

  the boy stamped his foot impatiently
my papa says that he knows one of
them will kill him he says that there are
bad men there

  the sailor laughed

  get back on deck if youre frightened
kid

  chaptel heard a low chuckle at his side
he turned to face a wrinkled old convict
whose clipped hair showed white

  the guard has the wind-up-hes lost
his nerve he said i knew him years ago
before that kid was born and he was a
hard nut then feared nothing i guess
getting married got his nerves frayed he
wont last long once they get scared they
either get killed or die in a few months from
worry i had been wondering why he was
so polite i served eight years under him
in a camp in the bush wood cutting
youve been in guiana before then
nine years escaped five years ago
roamed all over finally i got homesick for
the old village and sneaked in some one

saw me recognized me and i was re-arrested
at the dinner my sister had cooked to cele-
brate my home coming but dont worry
i wont be here long i know the ropes

  how did you manage it chaptel
asked

  easy enough when i succeeded i had
tried twice once by sea trying to make
a brazilian sail-boat the guards over-
hauled me and pulled me out just in time
to save me from the sharks the second
time i tried to make it by land intended
to cross the maroni into dutch guiana i
starved for two weeks then gave myself up
for that i pulled down thirty two months
altogether in the isle of silence

  whats that

  one of the salvation islands where the
tough eggs get sent there are three of
them royale saint-joseph and devils
island on royale they put those who try
to escape a first time or those who commit
murder while in guiana saint-joseph
which is called the isle of silence is for the
fellows who cant learn a lesson on second
offense youre sent there all the time
youre there youre not allowed to talk no
one talks to you if the keepers have any-
thing to let you know they use gestures or
a written slip you think it isnt hard
most men go crazy under that system i
was two years learning to talk after i left
you cant imagine what a man goes through
day after day without hearing a human
voice once in a while some fellow breaks
down and screams then he is punished
and his term extended it may be legal
but its torture just the same worse than
the old business of pouring melted lead into
a mans eyes

  you finally got away though

  it was this way from the isle of si-
lence i was sent back to cayenne on the
mainland but they had already more con-
victs than they could accommodate i was
scheduled to go back on to the island with
fifteen others in a small schooner piloted
by an old man named pierre who had been
doing just that business for years two
soldiers niggers from martinique were to
watch us but the sixteen of us were des-
perate all toughs without planning
anything we understood each other

  one night we jumped the niggers got
their guns away we tied up old man
pierre and the four men in his crew there
was one of us who had been a sailor before
knaves of spades

i

a quarter-master and he sure knew all
about sails he turned right around and
started for brazil in a few days we made
belem we kept pierre his crew and the
niggers below deck while we sold the cargo
for whatever it would bring then we
scooted ashore

  pierre complained to the brazilian au-
thorities but i dont know why brazil
dont put our kind out wont give us up
in belem i bet you you could count five
hundred men who have got away from
guiana they call themselves brothers
of the coast and live on what they can
pick up because they landed without
money

  we had money from the sale of the
cargo we scattered i saw the sailor once
after that three years after he was in
chili he had a coasting steamer all of his
own and took drinks with the port officials

i was a-fool and blew my money and i

got homesick and here i am i bet i get
three years silence but after that good-
by and next time i wont go home
youll chance it again

  yes i have a little money hidden away
though not as much as i should have if
you have money you can escape easy

  the conversation dropped

  and chaptel was hopeful

he recalled now his last inter-
view with his parents they had
come to algiers to see him before
j his departure for south america
he had found his mother aged twenty years
in appearance a white puffy face with
tearful eyes dressed in black she seemed
to be in mourning for him his father in
black frock-coat very solemn had been al-
most as pathetic he bit his mustache and
large tears streaked his cheeks and nose
although he made his voice rough and en-
couraging

  chaptel dully submitted to his mothers
embraces answered mechanically why
had he struck bichet she wouldnt under-
stand how long had he to serve in gui-
ana eight years after well he might
have to come back and serve a prison term
in algeria equal to his original condemna-
tion while in the battalion after he
would have to serve the balance of twenty
months still due to the army in total
about thirteen years

  she would be dead before that non-

sense he declared many women live to be
sixty but she could not be consoled and
begged the helpless guard to do something
to shorten her sons stay in penal institu-
tions before the time of the visit was up
she fainted the guard rushed out for
water

  i hope youve had your lesson said
chaptel senior look here i have a few
thousand francs left if they can ever help
you-let me know sacred thunder i
wish you could have employed them in a

different way-but life is life---

  listen father chaptel had said i
dont intend to stay in guiana ill escape
ill go to some foreign country you and
mother can join me there

  his father had nodded in agreement
blown his nose vigorously more heart-
rending minutes and chaptel was at last
alone he had wished that they had re-
frained from this last visit the sight of
his mother discouraged him made him re-
gret that he had not taken the braver
course would not his mother have pre-
fered him dead than think of him suffering
in a strange land

   the injustice of fate made him want to
scream to shout his denunciation of the
order of things in punishing him two in-
nocent people were punished two hard-
working honest persons but bouciauxs
family hulots the relatives of the old man
who had escaped all suffered life was
life and a bitter life

  he thought of lespart white-faced
lespart had reproached him with his lack
of honor and had declared himself through
not only with chaptel but with all punish-
ment camps the lieutenant had not spared
cutting words he said he fully realized
why men in charge of camps became like
bichet a few examples of ingratitude and
one never felt like trusting any man again
chaptel knew that all his later troubles had
arisen from his defense of lespart but his
ups were sealed

   he was aroused from his gloomy thoughts
by hulot who came to his side

   blue he asked

   yes i keep rolling things over and over
in my head and i feel as i was going to
burst in two i have eight years to serve
out there

   eight years sixteen you mean

   i was condemned to eight years thats
all


adventure

  you poor fool grunted hulot didnt
you ever hear about the doublage men
condemned to hard labor are supposed to
serve a length of time equal to that of their
sentence as free men colonists to build up
the colony if you servd five years hard
labor when you get through you cant
leave guiana for another five years eight
-you stay eight years eight and eight
are sixteen

  youre kidding me

  no my lawyer-i had a good law-
yer- hulot gave a world famous name-
told me so its called the law of may
th  the double system was used by
the english to colonize australia they
succeeded because the climate was good
this republic imitates them but guiana
isnt australia the double is the hardest
part the government stops feeding you
and you have to hunt your own grub
thank god i drew a life sentence with
me it means either escape or assured
living

  chaptel dug his nails into his palms

  i wont stand for it i wont

 - swore hulot it might be

worse suppose you had nine years instead
of eight

  shakily chaptel sought the veteran
from guiana he hoped that hulot was
not serious but it was a vain hope then
something seemed to break within him he
sank into a heap in a corner sobbing the
others stared at him puzzled after a
while chaptel got up glaring into space
im going he said

  hes off his head bouciaux an-
nounced

  headlong chaptel made for the iron
door pushing men out of his way roughly
they glanced at his face and feared to bar
his progress he grasped the iron bars and
screamed

  let me out let me out

  no one answered he battered his hands
against the steel his fingers were cut and
bleeding he fought against that inert
metal his frenzy growing sixteen years
his cries attracted attention

  the head guard appeared hand on his re-
volver

  stop that racket will you people will
think im murdering you down there

  i want to get out-i want to get out
chaptel pleaded

  you cant the guard replied then he

added tonight ill let you get on deck
if you want some air but stop shouting

  out out i want to go home

  the head guard summoned his assistants
they opened the door and halted chaptels
savage rush they were seven against one
yet the prisoner bore them to and fro for sev-
eral seconds before they could bring him
down and lace him into a straight jacket

  its begun said the head guard know-
ing that one such outburst would precipi-
tate others

  he was right for several hours the men
were screaming and fighting the sight of
the hysterical chaptel had snapped the over-
taut nerves

  at last worn out the guards were able to
rest

  i wonder what started that first man
the chief asked

  hulot laughed

  i told him about the doublage he said

one of the guards a resolute young man
under thirty faced the notorious criminal

  he isnt as hard as you are hulot its
enough to make any man go crazy to mix
with your kind

  theres one thing worse than an assas-
sin hulot said and thats a man whos
too lazy to work and too cowardly to steal
and makes his money watching us

  diplomatically the head guard ended the
controversy

  were all men we make our mistakes
you boys be quiet and ill give you wine

chaptels rebellion was of
short duration the head guard
accepted his promise and released
him exhausted from his out-
burst he slept like a beast that night

  when he awoke the loire was rolling
deep and the engines had stopped he
went to the port-hole and glanced out at the
land which might be his home for sixteen
years or if events took the usual trend his
grave he could not see much long lines of
palm trees rising from the shores of little in-
lets jagged black rocks emerging from the
blue water he was reminded of story-
book descriptions of deserted islands that
was his sole impression

  the veteran convict was at his elbow

  saint-laurent chaptel asked

  no cayenne i hear theres yellow
fever in saint-laurent well be landed
here
knaves of spades



  why dont we pull into port

  the muds too thick in the harbor well
be taken ashore in small boats see-
he indicated a fleet of boats rounding a point
of land-there they come

  french guiana has at call ten to fifteen
thousand pairs of arms those arms belong-
ing to men who so the law states are to be
employed at the hardest forms of labor
yet guiana possesses but a few miles of road
only seventeen miles of rail and lacks even a
passable harbor while the grass grows tall
in the main streets of the town the con-
victs work of course but not at anything
useful they sweat and die in the bush
cutting wood those who manage to live
cut more wood and thats all

  nice place chaptel pronounced

  the cess-pool of france replied the
other who knew

  the boats were bumping against the sides
of the loire each manned by six convicts
and a guard with the inevitable revolver
slung in a black leather holster from the
shoulder chaptel noticed that these guards
wore medals everywhere that he had gone
he had found that keepers wore medals

  he glanced with interest at the convicts
his future comrades torsos bare feet bare
legs clad in tattered trousers faces shaded by
immense straw hats they seemed little like
europeans rather members of some primi-
tive white race tattoo marks strength-
ened this impression until one was able to
decipher the inscriptions many of the
boatmen had words on their faces that
would prevent them from moving about in
a civilized community

  among the half score men within his
range of vision chaptel made out three
knaves of spades he wondered why the
men in charge never thought of associating
the mark so often met with as that of a se-
cret organization and yet the pip of spades
hidden in the crook of the left arm was not
easily seen dwarfed in importance by the
larger more striking drawings adorning
chests biceps and backs

  eh rats tail called the veteran
back again he thrust his wrinkled
face out of the port-hole how have you
been

  still alive the other replied so you
got caught did you

  no replied the old man with deep sar-
casm i came back for a visit then he
mentioned several names how are they

  four were dead two from sickness
one shot trying to escape  the fourth
guillotined two were serving time on the
isle of silence five were cutting wod up
bush one had escaped-one out of twelve

  the head-guard he who feared the pris-
oners came down unlocked the iron grill

  take your bundles pass before me one
by one go up on deck

  he had his hand on the butt of his revol-
ver and bit his mustache savagely hulot
swung his pack on his shoulders and led the
way bouciaux was next chaptel had to
wait his turn in this as in all things a
fashion of hierarchy had been instituted
among the prisoners

  chaptel hoisted himself up the compan-
ionway ever under the watchful eyes of the
guards strung out at strategical positions
he stumbled upon the deck which felt very
hot to his sandaled feet although the sun
was not as brilliant as in algeria the heat
was more intense chaptel was undergoing
the first feel of the tropics he descend-
ed the ships ladder into an open boat took
his seat in the stern without realizing he
leaned against the knee of the guard and
received a hearty kick in the small of his
back as a warning the craft gradually
filled up neither hulot nor the old man
were with chaptel and he felt very alone

  nagel called the guard when the boat
was full

  the men at th oars pushed away from
the loire swung their blades outboard and
leaned back

  a little pep barked the guard ryth-
mically the backs bent and straightened
bent and straightened the boat gathered
speed

  then came a sharp report

  the first one said one of the oarsmen
with a laugh

  a prisoner unwilling to land in guiana
had dived overboard and been shot evi-
dently the guards were instructed to pre-
vent even attempt at escape and were held
responsible for the deaths for the guard
near chaptel spoke up

  wont be any shooting here first guy
to make a move gets knocked on the head
and then goes to saint-joseph for a spell

  few would risk the isle of silence

  the boat rounded the last tongue of palm-
fringed land and cayenne was in sight
nothing extraordinary

  a huddle of gray and yellow houses


adventure

topped by the slender shaft of a steeple-
worship exists even in guiana-and the
crest of palm trees palm trees which
chaptel had ever associated with a life of
romance and ease and which now domi-
nated his gloomy existence

  they landed and formed in fours like
troops swung through the grass-grown
streets of cayenne toward the penitentiary
structures located some distance away from
the town the intervals between buildings
were spacious the aggregation well laid out
and with a little effort could have been made
charming but effort is hard to supply in
the humid heat

  chaptel was struck by the number of
breeds ranging from dusky mulattoes to al-
most white octoroons these had no curi-
osity concerning the newcomers convicts
were a familiar sight even the children
shouted their derision perfunctorily

  at the barracks the new arrivals were
given food and drink and then were as-
signed to their quarters against the re-
cent recruits precautions were taken the
guards had learned long ago that the first
night in guiana was the most to be feared
the men still retained a degree of courage
and determination had not yet sunk into
tropical apathy later the watch over
those who had proved to be good subjects
would be relaxed but this first night every
one must be ironed

  so chaptel lay down on the sloping plank
that served as bed his ankles locked within
circles of steel

the dull thud of machetes and
axes resounded the flies buzzed
and swarmed on perspiring backs
a group of sunburned skeletons
skin and bones bent and rose the majority
completely naked a few from habit
rather than decency still showed a pair of
ragged trousers the guard alone was com-
pletely dressed too completely for the taste
of the prisoners he carried carbine and
revolver

  the convicts of the french republic were
cutting brush from the path of the road that
was to link cayenne and saint-laurent du
maroni the road was planned in the time
of napoleon iii now two fifths of a cen-
tury later it had progressed fifteen miles
the famed weaving of penelope was a swift-
ly completed task compared with that road

  for eighteen months chaptel had been

in guiana fourteen of these he had spent
on the road the camp in the hills of al-
geria had not been a rest cure the guiana
road was a hundred times worse nothing
much to eat bad water-who cares about
the sanitary conditions of a convicts water
the south american tropics are a well-
known fever hole so the convicts had
fever more than half were constantly
shaking the guard himself had fever oc-
casionally a sick guard develops a grouch
a man with a high temperature is quick
with a revolver or a carbine or a club

  chaptel had been beaten he had been
shot in the leg once the guard sick or
drunk had seen him stray several feet out
of the way and suspected him or pretended
to suspect him pf trying to escape and had
discharged his pistol into his thigh a
dirty handkerchief on the wound and chap-
tel had gone on working

  he was younger than the others perhaps
of stronger constitution he had resisted
fever save for one or two attacks not con-
sidered sufficiently severe to permit him to
stop work neither was he the prey of
other common diseases his stomach was
sound his belly did not droop from his body
in that oval shaped sack nicknamed by the
french colonial egg which is caused by
minute worms swarming in a mans bowels
physically although gaunt and weary he
was sound mentally he was but half a
man the rest was brute a brute that
grunted at the sight of food drooled at the
sight of water and raved at the chance of a
drink of strong liquor

  when he thought of the camp in algeria
he was overcome with loneliness of his
previous life he had very little recollection
it seemed to him that he had always been in
prison at first he had availed himself of
his membership in the knaves of spades
but the great hold of the knaves had been
the fear of death

  here on the road that fear did not exist
a knife thrust was considered a mercy
very often men took matters in their own
hands and were found hanged one had
even choked himself with his fingers a mon-
strous evidence of a desire for death that
stilled the last vestige of self-preservation
several had tried to force the guard to give
them a pass to a better world by bolting for
the bush but the guard wounded them in
the legs guiana was one land where spar-
ing a mans life was not considered a mercy
knaves of spades



  chaptel often laughed loudly at night in
the bamboo hut that was when he recalled
the time he had desired to come to cayenne
but many men laughed as he did for one
reason or another so no one paid attention
sometimes a wind of revolt would blow over
the huts the death of a guard then a try at
escape in a body but it fell through al-
ways these men had not been able to
agree with the world no more could they
agree with each other

  hulot was dead in an attempt to escape
from the bush settlement where he was de-
tained he had killed a guard the head
guard of the loire he who had foreseen his
end at the hand of a convict hulot had
been tried and condemned to the guillotine
chaptel had heard the gruesome story of
that execution the executioner was a con-
vict and half-mad he took excessive pride
in his bloody calling often in the last
struggle before the heavy blade falls the
victim pulls his head out of position and the
edge strikes the base of the skull thereby
causing what the executioner termed a
messy job and moreover nicking the
blade to forestall this the guiana execu-
tioner had invented a simple device he
attached a pound of lead to the guillotine
which would drop upon the skull a fifth of
a second before the blade was released
stunned the man relaxed and the edge
found no other obstacle than the spinal
column

  hulot more vigorous than others had
twisted himself half around from the sloping
plank the lead weight had stunned him
in that position and the blade in its course
had severed his head obliquely cutting off
part of the chin ashamed of himself for
what he called his dishonor the execution-
er had taken the hundred francs paid him
for each execution and had kept drunk for
two weeks

  bouciaux had a more glorious finish

  his southern imagination had overcome
the apathy of the climate and he had tried a
first escape for days he had roamed the
bush on the banks of the maroni river try-
ing to obtain ferriage across to dutch gui-
ana but he had no money neither ne-
groes indians nor liberated convicts were
willing to help him out free of charge
caught he had been sent to the isle of si-
lence bouciaux the songbird and silence
that could not exist he sang as he had al-
ways sung he was punished saw his term

lengthen to thousands of days in a lonely
cell without light he decided to get out
if only to go to the guillotine and dislocated
a guards shoulder the guard and two of
his kind had beaten him into insensibility
beaten him so severely that he was taken
to the hospital three days after a coffin
was missing one of the few on the island
for there a coffin can be used an unlimited
number of times the coffin is opened on
one side the corpse deposited and then
taken a few hundred feet from the shore
and dumped into the sea the sharks do
the rest

  so bouciaux had stolen a coffin and in
this crude and sinister craft had struck out
for another shore a launch sent after him
had soon overhauled him the singer stood
up waved a mocking farewell and leaped
into the water the sharks perhaps be-
cause they were not accustomed to see their
human food in action had spared him long
and bouciaux had evaded the launch in
which men were making frantic efforts to
save him for the living death of the cell at
last a shark had done his duty and bou-
ciaux and his voice were gone forever

  chaptel wondered when his brain could
wonder at anything but his immense misery
how many of the men who had come with
him on the loire would ever see france
again to think himself one of the excep-
tions was not sane yet where there is no
sane hope a man will cling to a mad hope

  in vain chaptel had tried to obtain as-
signment as a house servant to some white
man either in cayenne or saint-lau-
rent there were fortunate convicts who
served their period of punishment in this
manner he had written to the governor
to the inspector of the penitentiary grovel-
ing pleading letters but here again he
found that he lacked distinction he was
not an assassin not even a murderer he
was nobody save a number in the thirty
thousands  to be accurate there is
a coquetry among employers of convict ser-
vants in guiana they like to say to their
invited guests

  my servant is so-and-so of the famous
murder case look how docile he is with
me

  so he was cutting shrubs while the man
who had poisoned his wife and children went
forth to a more alluring life one was roll-
ing pills in the hospital another distin-
guished prisoner was teaching school a


adventure

third was serving his term de luxe as butler
in a house in town he had friends in the
legislative chambers who saw to it that he
was not harshly dealt with liberty equal-
ity fraternity vain words in guiana-as
elsewhere

  eh there calfs head shouted the
guard do you want me to wake you up
magre the guard who did not lack a
sense of humor had branded his charges
with nicknames it is doubtful if his humor
would have lasted had he known that the
prisoners called him black monkey
chaptel straightened wearily lifted his
ax the roots in the ground were thick
and strong and it took many blows to slice
them into fragments and chaptel often cut
his feet that did not matter greatly his feet
were not things of beauty the jiggers
had bored under his toe nails he had
scratched his soles on spines the sores had
festered and not treated carefully lasted
long walking was much like stepping on a
pin cushion with the points wrong side out
part of the day and all the night the mos-
quitoes were busy there were venomous
spiders in the bush also small snakes with
nasty bites the guard who wore boots
stayed in the open and ordered his men to
go ahead

  calfs head do you absolutely wish me
to help you with my foot in a place where it
will do the most good

  no chief

  work harder then

iiflmt the ax rose and fell eighteen
jfjjyk months a strong man could
jopfjb last three years some lasted five

        but never eight and if he
served his eight years hard labor he would
have to remain eight more earning his living
as best he could one man among the thou-
sands waiting for the half dozen jobs avail-
able no wonder the man serving doublage
tired of being hungry committed another
crime to get back into hard labor where at
least a small amount of food was assured
the day progressed the sun grew hotter
the rainy season in guiana is long six to
eight months and during the rest of the
year there are occasional storms the
ground is always sodden hence the steam-
like air and the mosquitoes blazing sun on
swampy soil part of the day then drizzling
rain pouring rain flooding rain one day
follows the preceding to give place to an-

other no let up no rest the guards go
to france on leave every two or three years
they are given a rest in town every few
weeks the convicts live on and on with-
out change live and then die die on a day
like all the others

  enough for today suddenly pro-
nounced magre who was finding it too hot
even though he did not have to labor

  he herded the men back into the huts

  chaptel lay down like the others the
hut smelled there were mosquitoes vi-
brating in the convenient obscurity but
there was no work it has been said that
the relief from pain is happiness chaptel
was not tortured as much in the hut as in
the bush so it might be said that he was
happy

  all about the fever-stricken men chattered
their teeth like rattles some were past the
first stage and delirious they were allowed
to howl as they pleased to do what their de-
mented minds willed them as long as they
did not threaten violence being sick they
were entitled to quinin but the guard
was sensitive to bad odors and loathsome
sights and did not bother with the formality
which would bring him into the hut one
got well without quinin or one did not it
was all the same to him

  two men had found the courage to con-
verse

  what did you do to come here 

  then followed a lengthy tale of blood
how much was real how much was imagina-
tion no one could say the speaker him-
self probably did not know

  chaptel laughed the others thought he
had fever what had he done to come here
been a fool a young fool that was all lis-
tened to older men talk then imitated them
after he had been slightly drunk and
got mixed up with a bad affair through a
man named duval after he had risked
his life to save a man who had befriended
him and then to save his own life he
had wounded lightly a man who deserved
death that was all

  time after time he had resumed his brief
story unbalanced or not he believed that
he had not done enough to deserve what he
was undergoing those others perhaps
who had killed looted deserved a hun-
dredth part of what they endured and
even their victims would have forgiven them
if they could have seen the punishment

  the main idea was to prevent reoccurrence
knaves of spades



of the crime so the laws said but the
world was hypocritical and in reality took
revenge enjoyed the tortures it inflicted on
the misfits the half lunatics those who re-
belled against ordained custom and took the
law into their own hands a man stole a
million he was lightly punished or acquit-
ted with a near apology another stole a
few francs he was imprisoned in hell
why because one was educated or intel-
ligent enough to do the thing bloodlessly
while the other was primitive and reacted
with less hypocrisy to his desire for gain

   crime was eternal such crimes as his
chaptels would never end because a
man would always be foolish when young
always be loyal to friends false though they
might prove and would always fear
death

   the man next to him begged for tobacco
chaptel had never learned to refuse he
fumbled beneath the rags which served as a
blanket and found a package of cigarets

  here he said have you a match
no-just a minute

   he produced a bottle half filled with
matches against the rules to smoke in
the huts or to have matches but every
man was willing to risk a beating from the
guard for the sake of tobacco

   chaptel scratched the match then tempt-
ed by the first whiff of smoke lighted a
cigaret for himself

   i just arrived this afternoon and have
no pal here didnt expect youd give me
anything but tried it just the same then
he looked closer werent you a friend of
hulots

  yes

i place you now youre the kid that
threw the fit when he learned about the
doublage what do you think of that i
was the guy that told you aboutmy escapes
the old man

  the old man

   inarticulately chaptel gropedout for his
hand he thought he saw a ray of light
the old man-who knew about the ways of
escape-who had told him that if oie had
money one could escape

   they only gave me a year and a half in
the isle of silence the other went on be-
cause they said i hadnt done anything bad
while i was out it pays to be good dont
it whats your name

   calfs head chaptel said mechanically
   i mean your real name i couldnt call

a fellow who gave me a smoke calfs
head

  chaptel

    chaptel-chaptel- 

  i thought youd be out before now

  i had no chance

  you could fix magre up-hes out for
the cash

  magre you sure

  just lately i heard about him the old
man went on theres a fellow in america
now who got away through him and many
others that i dont know about

  hell get me out of here for money
surest thing you know hes square
that way he is he fixes it up so that no
one will go after you for a while

  chaptel at first wildly hopeful grew des-
pondent

  but i cant get much money my old
man has it in france he told me i could
have--all i wanted-but the authorities
dont let much money through at a time
dont fret magre will attend to it i
think he has a pal in france who collects in
advance

  and its almost a sure thing

  if you have two thousand francs sonny
you may be smoking a cigar in buenos aires
inside of three or four months you can get
away from here i know that through magre
the rest wont be so easy but it wont be
any harder than here

  again chaptel reached out and grasped
the old mans hand

  thanks he whispered

  you gave me tobacco so i put you on
one favor claims a return the old man said

         fear of magre vanished with
jyjvijf the knowledge that he could be
k bribed but he must use caution
isa jn approaching him else less for-
tunate members of the convict group might
overhear and report magre to the inspector
private conversation with the guard in the
ordinary course of work was impossible
magre never came close to the men no
nearer than was absolutely necessary for a
kick not only were his sensitive nostrils
offended by the odor of unwashed humanity
but the convicts were armed with sharp
weapons and there were among them a fair
proportion who would not hesitate to bury
an ax between the uniformed mans shoul-
der blades

  the first thing to accomplish therefore


adventure

was a chance to speak a few words to the
guard and so on the next afternoon chap-
tel misdirected an ax blow and opened a
neat gash across his right anlde the blood
flowed to sink to the ground groaning in
pain was the next move

  magre loosened his revolver from the hol-
ster waved the other men away from chap-
tel and drew near

  another cut calfs head your mother
should have married a wood-cutter hed
have taught you to use an ax

  it hurts-moaned chaptel it hurts
then swiftly in a lower voice-

  chief youre interested in money arent
you

  magres expression did not change he
brought up a tender hand to smooth his
mustache

  youre not hurt bad enough to quit
work come around to my tent for iodin
tonight

  magre had understood for it was not
the guards habit to show solicitude for a
minor injury

  chaptel begged a rag from a comrade
chewed a few leaves into a pulp which he
applied to the cut a tight bandage and
the bleeding stopped a cheap price to
pay for a private interview that might mean
liberty

  after bolting his scanty ration of boiled
meat chaptel went to the guards hut

   magre was in his shirt sleeves feet in slip-
pers from the waist band on his trousers
the butt of a service revolver jutted chap-
tell pushed the door shut with his heel and
stood at attention

  theres iodin on the table fix your
ankle suggested magre

  chaptel opened the bottle and washed the
cut with the burning liquid he wrapped
the wound in gauze supplied by the guard

  you spoke about money magre began
you want a favor is it a transfer to a soft
snap in cayenne or saint-laurent or the
big thing

  the big thing

  how much are you willing to pay
  five hundred francs

  nonsense grunted magre thats
less than it costs me i wont do this thing
at a loss

  whats the usual price

  i risk my position as guard i risk hav-
ing to join you boys four thousand francs
is the very least

  all right four thousand francs
before we go any further i want to know
a thing or two are you resolute can you
stand hardships the worst hardships a man
can endure

  i can-you know that

  escape is not a bed of roses magre
explained particularly my way if it
was only a question of getting you across
the maroni into dutch guiana that would
be different but the dutchmen are treach-
erous sometimes when they need labor
they accept all the escaped men from here
when business slacks they send them back
i cant afford to have any of my men sent
back my way is sure no one of the
fellows i helped was ever recaptured heres
a list he drew a paper from the table
drawer before him here are the men who
escaped from this place i swear to you
that not one of the names marked recap-
tured or shot paid me a cent they all
tried it on their own now you sit down
here and write a note to whoever has the
money mark the address plainly put in
enough personal details to assure the re-
ceiver of your identity how many of your
fathers teeth are missing the brand of
tobacco he prefers what you did the day
before your tenth birthday understand
yes chief

  i have an associate in france who col-
lects hell send me a letter when its done
then-ill see that you make your break
by the way you may have a friend who can
fork over the right amount take him with
you it dont cost much more for me to
get two out than one clear profit

  i know some one

  fine from this week on im going to
make you a trusted man youll take tools
to be mended to saint-laurent youll bear
letters and so on that means that youll
be gone days at a time four five as long
as a week people around here will get used
to your absences so when you really go
i wont have to report you for several days
i can always say i had sent you on an
errand

  days and days without being watched
but magre was something of a mind
reader

  better not try and escape on your own
my boy the niggers between here and
saint-laurent are all out to collect reward
for bringing in escaped convicts you have
no money to pay a canoe to take you across
knaves of spades



the maroni at least i dont think you have
you dont want to give up the substance
for the shadow in three months the an-
swer will be here then you can go with
an even chance

  what guarantee have i that youll carry
out your bargain once the moneys in your
hands

  the guys wanting to escape know my
name and in some way learn the result of
my help you heard did you not if i
once fail good-by money and i want
money its not on the salary i get here
and the petty graft on the eats that ill
make my pile this escape game brings me
sometimes as high as thirty thousand francs
a year i cant run the chance of losing
out on that

  thats right chaptel was compelled
to admit

  now get out or the night guard will be
here after you

  chaptel his hand on the door handle
asked a last question-

  if my father refuses or cant supply the
money what then

  then magre shrugged did any one
ask you to bribe me no you started
things yourself if the money is not forth-
coming well ill say you tried to escape
magre touched the butt of his revolver
suggestively

  chaptel paled his father although he
had mentioned the few thousands might
fall short of the amount his credit in town
might not be very good with a son in
guiana

  some disappointed fellow might squeal
magre explained thats why i cant
afford to take the chance now get out
and good luck

with hope chaptel became
more cheerful fand his new work
that of messenger was not as
tedious and back-breaking as the
road he and lavaud the old man had
also managed a private interview with
magre walked together along the grass-
grown trails convicts having this com-
parative liberty were not rare and they
attracted no attention in saint-laurent
out of the small amount of money each re-
ceived from home were purchased strong
shoes and clothing the shirt must bear
a number stitched across the breast

  magre for appearance sake kicked chap-

tel perfunctorily when he came within range
of his boot in public but they were al-
ready privileged characters lavaud the
more experienced warned chaptel against
appearing too happy happiness was not
normal and would cause suspicion

   months passed

   then one day when they were on the way
 to saint-laurent a stranger suddenly stood
 before them framed by thick bushes

   he was a large sunburned fellow with a
 good-looking face and splendid teeth which
 he was manifestly glad to show in a smile
 he was dressed in stout brown clothing
 wore tall laced boots and carried a sporting
 rifle in the crook of his elbow at first
 glance chaptel believed him to be white
 then the liquid brilliancy of his eyes his
 teeth something in his voice revealed the
 negro strain when he removed his large
 straw hat in a mockingly elaborate saluta-
 tion chaptel saw that his skull was covered
 with wool a graying wool

   messieurs chaptel and lavaud

   yes replied chaptel bewildered by the
 unfamiliar appellation and his family name

   i represent chief magre everything
is settled and youre to follow me

  follow you where

   youll learn in proper time

  you mean-escape

   no less

   a quarteroon chaptel decided one of the
 self-styled cayenne creoles he spoke
 good french save for an occasional lapse
 into the mulatto patois spoken on the coast

   chaptel and lavaud were too astonished
 to move but stared mouths agape at this
 man who was to lead them into liberty

  my name is yo-yo the native de-
clared behind me in the bush youll find
a bundle with clothes theres a double-
barreled shotgun for one of you quinin
in case of fever also a small ax and two
knives

   chaptel was the first to make for the
thicket there he found the bundle they
found laced boots to fit their feet and brown
clothing chaptel took the gun and slung
two bags of cartridges across his shoulders
lavaud contented himself with the other
supplies which included various articles of
culinary aspect

  ready yo-yo announced chaptel
ringingly

   fine lets get off this picada-trail-
 into a less public road from today on
o

adventure

we want no one to see us follow me
they swung in after him left the road
and were soon lost in the bushes yo-yo
moved without sound he was an expert
bushman that could easily be perceived
but he did not seem talkative in fact
offered no further remark that day at
dusk they entered even thicker growth
where immensely tall trees lifted above the
bushes monkeys barked in the distance
matto bravo said the guide loconically
i know as much as i did before chap-
tel said with a laugh

  gun in hand in decent clothing and at
the end of his imprisonment he had re-
covered his gaiety with astonishing speed 

  bad wood explained yo-yo but
for you good wood

  he marched ahead steadily until dark-
ness fell then found a clear spot not too
damp and spread two blankets which he
carried slung army fashion around his torso
he produced a bulky parcel

  dried meat he said all for tonight
we cant shoot or light a fire so near traveled
roads theres water in the tin bottle try
to sleep as quick as you can

  and the first day of liberty drew to a
close

  yo-yo was up with the sun and went on
at the same tireless gait he never asked
whether the two found it difficult to keep
up this was not his first experience with
escaping men evidently and he was aware
that no pace was too swift the hours suc-
ceeded each other surprizingly devoid of
incident for two days the trio existed on
dried meat and water then yo-yo shot
monkeys and small animals which he called
pecas a sort of rodent not unlike the hare
he lighted small fires and roasted the meat
when chaptel or lavaud tried to engage
him in conversation he yawned and pre-
tended to sleep

  after nine or ten days chaptel asked a
definite question

  are we nearly out

  no

  how much longer will it take us
  three months-maybe four

  chaptel gasped

  but it will be worth it yo-yo con-
cluded and smiled and said nothing more

  the next important remark was made
more than a week later chaptel noticed
that when the choice lay between two roads
one hard and well defined the other boggy

and overgrown yo-yo invariably chose the
latter he questioned him for his reason

  this is the dry season said yo-yo
if we keep to the dry roads we wont find
many animals no animals no food its
not knowing that gets fellows like you into
trouble when you go out without a guide
ive seen escaping men starving while i
lived on the fat of the land

  chaptel injected a subtle flattery in his
voice

  i suppose you could go out with almost
no equipment and make your way in com-
fort you seem to know these roads as
peter knows heaven

  yo-yo showed his teeth in a swift smile
twenty-seven years ive roamed around
here

  just doing this taking convicts out
its a hard way to make a living i should
think

  youve got no reason to complain
theres gold ahead

  gold lavaud exclaimed

  and chaptel could not repress a thrill
of excitement

  yes i have found it too but it is in
small amounts in the river banks i dont
care for that the soil here is much the
same as california and australia where
gold is found theres a rich strike to be
made somewhere and i keep on looking
but i need money for equipment and to
live when im in cayenne i suggested this
scheme to magre and weve been running
it for seven years he doesnt pay me much
fifteen hundred francs for this trip but
i can get along on it well enough after ive
got you out ill retrace my steps and ex-
amine closer all the places that have looked
likely to me on the way youve seen me
fool about with a pan havent you
yes

  i was sifting for gold yo-yo hesitated
i dont know why i tell you all this its
none of your business

  lavaud signaled for chaptel to lag be-
hind and when yo-yo was at a safe dis-
tance pointed out

  he thinks well watch him and do him
yp if he makes a strike you better talk
to him and say we wont youve got a
good tongue and can put him off his guard
then if he finds it well if the two of us had
plenty of gold wed be safe even if we
walked back into cayenne cigars in our
beaks
knaves of spades



will you shut up you dirty old mur-
derer chaptel invited

 lavaud laughed quietly to himself

 from then on yo-yo dropped
 his attitude of suspicion toward
 chaptel and talked freely

 one day unexpectedly he
 asked to see chaptels hand after looking
 a long time at the palm he came to a
 conclusion

 youre not bad he said

 lavaud was forcibly out of this newly
 established intimacy and resented it al-
 though he tried to hide his feelings

 i dont like that portion of a nigger
 he said

 forget it chaptel advised youre
 getting out arent you if youre going to
 get fussy about your associates at this
 time-

 hes an outsider we two are bagnards-
 convicts-and he isnt

 hed soon be if he was caught helping
 us if thats any consolation

 hes doing it for money not because he
 likes us

 what did you kill for before being sent
 here love

no but-

 chaptel soon tired of the endless senile
 arguments and joined yo-yo the guide
 would point out matters of interest in the
 woods reveal what he knew of bush-lore
 once they were startled by the appearance
 of a jaguar yo-yo picked up a dead
 branch and threw it at the big cat which
 vanished in a spotted streak across the path

 shaking chaptel wiped his face with a
 sleeve

 narrow escape he breathed

 as for lavaud his power of speech was
 gone and he gazed at yo-yo with intense
 admiration

narrow escape yo-yo grunted
thats what that tiger thinks he was so
scared you could have gone up and pulled
his tail as long as he wasnt wounded he
wouldnt lift a claw against a man theres
nothing dangerous to man in the woods
except insects

 and snakes said chaptel

 theyll go if you give them a chance
 the worse things are the pecaris and theres
 always a tree handy with a good rifle a
 man has nothing to fear

 although it was important to save am-

 munition yo-yo sacrificed a number of the
 precious cartridges to exhibit his prowess
 as a marksman then he taught chaptel
 how to make a fire with dry sticks how to
 cook a piece of meat in the open the trip
 assumed the aspect of a personally con-
 ducted hunting expedition whole days
 were wasted while he learned to stalk a
 tapir yo-yo and he made new soles for the
 worn-out boots with raw hides made hats
 out of palm leaves

  old man lavaud persisted in considering
himself and chaptel bound together against
yo-yo he darkly hinted that the quar-
teroon would not forever be the center of the
picture and he lavaud would take his
place as leader for he was the most ancient
his jealousy reminded chaptel in a maudlin
way of duvals jealousy of lespart but
he had made a resolution that he was
through considering the opinion of his fellow
convict should matters reach a climax
and he be forced to choose between one of
the two he would side with yo-yo

  on second thought lavauds pretension
was ridiculous no more than chaptel did
he know even within hundreds of miles
where they were chaptel was not always
certain of general directions such as north
and south the trails taken by yo-yo
meandered in bewildering fashion they
might be as near brazil as dutch guiana
and they were completely at yo-yos
mercy

  if the guide suddenly decided never to
return from one of the numerous hunting
trips he took by himself to procure food
when game was scarce in the immediate
vicinity lavaud and chaptel would die in
the forest they could of course find a
stream follow it to another and so on until
they reached the coast but they might be
unfortunate enough to return to the start-
ing point and be imprisoned on the isle of
silence with everything to be done over
again yo-yo had also dropped several re-
marks concerning the presence of nikey
epidians indians who ate human flesh
once they had seen smoke rising from a
clearing and the guide had circled the spot
with great caution

  yo-yo was aware of lavauds antago-
nism forced to face him at meal time he
was compelled to take a definite attitude
and picked that of amused tolerance the
old man was querulous and although he
should have been disciplined by the years


adventure

of solitary confinement lie spoke his mind
freely on all subjects he called yo-yo a
coalsack and other names referring to his
ancestry and legitimacy chaptel was often
tempted to halt him fearful that yo-yo
would become angry and leave the ungrate-
ful wretch to himself he had come to feel
a sense of responsibility for lavaud and
wanted to see him safely through but
yo-yo allowed the remarks to slide off un-
noticed from his armor of contempt

  hes a rude-mouthed old--chaptel
apologized for his friend but hes pretty
near in his second childhood and the pen
is not a place to learn manners

  let him talk yo-yo said with a sad
smile he merely voices aloud what others
think there is less disgust in his eyes than
in those of many people who have called me
monsieur its a relief to hear any man
come out with his inner thoughts

  i try to keep him quiet as much as
i can

  dont bother i only hope for his sake
that he gets back where he wont have to
see any man my color- again he smiled
slowly-or rather with my sort of hair
because i look pure white as to face
dont i

  sure you do

  the following week saw them out of the
jungle and traveling through open plains
which yo-yo called campos they met
groups of indians poor looking creatures
armed with bows and arrows the guide
conversed with them in their own tongue
they were good people he said who asked
for nothing better than to live in peace
chaptel who had believed all indians to be
beardless saw with surprize that many of
these men had mustaches macouchis was
their tribal name according to yo-yo they
had once lived nearer the coast hne but the
first white invaders and the raids of war-
like tribes of their own color had driven
them back inland

  yo-yo trusted them sufficiently to rest
in one of the villages chaptel became ac-
quainted with cachiri an alcohol made from
sugar cane he never touched it again after
he was informed by yo-yo that the juice
was procured by a primitive process the
women of the village chewed the cane and
spat the juice into a container one glance
at the elderly dames sprawled in their
wrinkled greasy nakedness and cachiri was
forbidden to his not too sensitive stomach

in vain yo-yo insisted that on occasion
it was made in a crude mill

  with the village as a base the three men
investigated the surrounding country gold
could be washed out in small quantities
although working for yo-yo chaptel was
enough interested to labor long hours it
was fascinating to sift the brilliant particles
from the sand and to think that the metal
would find its way into the civilized world
to cause havoc probably on one occasion
chaptel found two small nuggets which he
turned over to yo-yo lavaud was also
lucky but had to be compelled to give up
his finds since the sight of gold the old
man seemed to have gone mad could talk of
nothing else

  big sacks of it he shouted jubilantly
big sacks in the right place lets stay
here chaptel for a few years and get all
we can

  and die before we could get out eh
not much id sooner see a railroad track
than all the gold in guiana

  yo-yo smiled and pensively weighed the
small bags in his palm

  ill sell them when we get there he
murmured

  where asked chaptel

  where were going

  their destination that was one bit of
information chaptel could never obtain
from yo-yo possibly the guide still feared
that if the two knew their way or believed
they did his life would be in danger con-
victs had been known to commit murder for
less than the small amount of gold at
hand

         gold yo-yo said one night
wen the two lay before the fire
cn	in the maloca-hut-assigned to

         them by the villagers gold-i
dont know why i want to find it but i
want to perhaps its more for the thrill of
coming back and announcing a big strike
gold-the finding of gold in big quantities
would make guiana an important place
chaptel men would come from all over
the world the convicts would be sent else-
where cayenne would have a good harbor
saint-laurent would become a big city
with gambling saloons dance halls and tall
buildings look at california australia
where would they be now if gold had not
been found there youll say the climate
is better than here i grant that but it
knaves of spades



needs more than a good climate to attract
men anywhere

  he paused thoughtfully then went on

  i picture myself at times coming back
to cayenne placing a few sizable nuggets
before the governor and saying- theres
any amount at such and such a place
then sit back and watch things happen
men from everywhere i said frenchmen
germans americans all sorts and id
say to myself- you did all that yo-yo 
youre something of a guianian yo-yo
i didnt suspect you of so much love for
your country

  this isnt my country said yo-yo

i dont give a - what becomes of it

but id enjoy the feeling of being the first
cause for the movements of a quarter million
men dont think i mean personal fame
i wouldnt care if my name was never men-
tioned its my own private satisfaction
that would matter

   he lighted his pipe for a fifth time

  if i did that-discovered gold in plenty-
id be justifying the faith of a half hun-
dred world-famous men do you know
that early legends stated that el dorado
was in guiana more particularly in that
part now french in the sixteenth century
a spanish pirate martinez crawled back
to havana to die on his deathbed he said
that he had discovered immense gold de-
posits in the upper country of this very coast

  he was a good catholic and would not
have lied to a priest i believe he told the
truth the english knight walter raleigh
believed that too he would have come
back here if he had not been executed
how many looked for the fabulous manoa
deldorado i cant say i found two skele-
tons some years ago in the thick bush by
mount leblond from the remnants of
dress they had died in the late sixteenth or
early seventeenth century i brought back
to cayenne what was left of a rusty rapier
an official bought it for six hundred francs
for a museum the gold exists as martinez
said it did

  florimon a frenchman around 
was shown a creek by a native and picked
up five pounds in nuggets right on the spot
he stood on he went crazy with the idea
rushed back to the coast got backing and
was unable to find thereafter either the
native who had guided him or the creek
lavaud ten feet away hoisted himself
on his elbows

  sure theres gold here you sooty ape

i can find it if i stay long enough

  go to sleep and give us a rest chaptel
suggested roughly

  yo-yo talked on launched on the topic
of gold he could not be halted his knowl-
edge of the bush was paralleled by his
erudition concerning the dim history of
guiana from the discovery of the coun-
try by vicente yanez pincon to the actual
time he reeled off names and dates of the
explorers in broad outline he painted the
early struggles the arrival of white men
black slaves and the gradual receding of
the indians into the interior the epic tale
of poncet and his companions greedy but
brave resisting the temptation to abandon
the game and massacred to the last man by
the natives

  the fantastic expedition led by the abbe
marivault and de royville eight hundred
men in all who started from paris with
high hopes of conquest marivault fell into
the seine river and was drowned at the
start de royville was assassinated by his
followers on the high seas then as now
guiana was synonymous with blood of
the eight hundred only fifteen escaped alive
to suriname up the coast

  yo-yo was gifted with a pleasant voice
and an ability to choose words his recital
became almost a chant a saga chaptel
saw the formidable figures of pirates and
gentlemen of fortune not always distinctly
separated rise out of the past stride into
the unknown with heroic swing facing in-
dians starvation fever in the hope of gold
but what pleases one man does not neces-
sarily please another lavaud interested
when the talk rolled on the present gave
up listening when historical events were
mentioned and soon was snoring 

  yo-yo threw another stick on the fire
tell me said chaptel abruptly tell
me yo-yo where were you born if not in
cayenne and where did you learn all
those details and why are you here help-
ing two bums escape from- instead of

discoursing on history in some school in
france or anywhere else for that matter
the guide touched his wool

  thats why

  he smiled and chaptel caught a glimpse
of the real man behind the mask affected
by yo-yo the smile was bitter self-mock-
ing no sane man smiled thus no mad
man either thought chaptel the smile


adventure

was not human it was more than a gri-
mace more than a reflection of an emotion
it held all the rancor of a tortured mind

  i once thought myself white would you
believe it chaptel i might as well tell
you what makes me suffer is not the scorn
of others but my own scorn my earliest
recollection is senegal in africa my father
was an officer down there i had a real
name not yo-yo there were blacks all
about me and i considered them as others
did i had learned by the time i was ten
that i was not exactly like other children
there was much talk about my mother
who was dead

  i caught a bit here and there no one
thought i noticed my father had been sta-
tioned in martinique in the west indies
it was there that i was born i went with
him everywhere after that until he thought
i needed more education then he sent me
to france to a private school i learned
many things quickly i guess although i
did not suspect it at the time that the un-
tired brains of my black ancestors gave me
more mental vitality than is usual i won
the red-covered prize books the laurel crown
at the end of the school terms i was some-
what of a hero among my comrades be-
cause of my early travels

  when i was about thirteen big and
strong for my age getting to be a man an
unbelievable thing happened my hair
until then had been curly and black but
not woolly i guess my strain of black
showed with puberty it got woolly my
hair did at first i liked the feel of it wien
my father came home i told him and he
told me the truth can you conceive the
colossal unconcern of the man to let me
shap my life white and then laugh it off as
he did when he saw my wool the fact
preyed on me i still went to school and
had lost interest when i had served my
time of service in the cavalry i applied and
obtained a colonial position in the govern-
ment i was sent to cayenne

  i was thin-skinned i soon saw that i
was rated among the creoles i kept by
myself and studied furiously to forget
i read all the books to be had on guiana
and suddenly got the gold madness i
chucked up the job and set out and thats
all ive done ever since i never saw my
father after what he told me i guess he
was afraid of me he died some years back
i have half brothers and sisters in france

who got the money he was right to forget
me i wish hed forgotten me earlier in
martinique

  but why do you make money illegally
it doesnt seem in your character you
dont like us convicts

  why it amuses me to turn you back
upon france and the rest of the world
yo-yo laughed loudly white men-white
men-white men

  chaptel made no remark yo-yo went
on and on gradually his discourse became
more and more entangled he mentioned
events that had occurred in guiana and
which he said he had witnessed when but
a few moments before he had said that at
that time he was in france he spoke of
his grandmother smoking a pipe on the
threshold of a hut

  it suddenly dawned upon chaptel that
the sad tale was fiction made up by the
imaginative yo-yo to color his character
the same impulse that caused him to hunt
for gold that he might startle the universe
with his discoveries yo-yo was insane
far more insane than the old man lavaud
asprawl in the dark corner

  it was a horrible plight this being cooped
up with two maniacs he began to doubt
his own sanity the fleeting smiles on
yo-yos face were disturbing he must not
let him know that he suspected the truth
but yo-yo was far from being disconcerted
he was lost in an imaginary world of his
own his voice rose higher and higher
the yarns had brought him to a dangerous
pitch of exaltation chaptel quietly spread
his blanket and stretched out

  he tried to keep awake but presently
dozed off into a deep sleep and the last he
heard was yo-yos reiterated words

  white men white men

after leaving the indian vil-
lage they roamed in the un-
chartered territory south of a
high mountain which chaptel
later learned was mount leblond they
spent days and nights in deep damp gullies
on wind swept plateaus in the jungle in
the leather pouch sluing over yo-yos back
bounced little bags of gold-dust

  lavaud now boasted a long gray beard
and a mane of snowy hair which combined
with his wrinkled puffy face gave him the
startling appearance of a dissolute patriarch
yo-yo had kept his face clean-shaven
knaves of spades



chaptel had learned the fact that in spite
of his muscular frame and utter oblivion
to fatigue he was but two years under
sixty

  chaptel when he took the trouble to gaze
into an igarapey limpa yo-yos term for a
limpid brook could scarcely believe that
the brown lean black-bearded face was his
debilitating as the climate was supposed
to be none of the three men had been
harmed the quinin the plain fare the
constant exercise had kept them in con-
dition they were all suffering from insect
bites and lavaud had eczema a little an-
noyance indeed compared with what chap-
tel had been led to expect

  one hundred and twelve days after the
first meeting with yo-yo they came to the
first white mans dwellings a brazilian mili-
tary outpost on the right bank of the
aragouary river a score of huts similar
to those of the natives a crudely erected
church a cemetery with dilapidated wooden
crosses a staked enclosure holding a few
oxen that was all the soldiers were
ragged they had old rifles antiquated
bayonets that did not fit their guns and
no shoes but one of them was pure white
the others were indians negroes and the
various racial subdivisions that can be
created by a free mixture of white black
and red these soldiers had their families
with them

  as warriors they were not impressing
they sat about gloomily without pretense
of desire to be ready to exercise their calling
even the oxen seemed a prey to the all-
prevailing boredom

  yo-yo sought the commander and pre-
sented a paper bearing the official stamp of
the french government and accrediting
messieurs pardon picard and marechal-
yo-yo chaptel and lavaud-gold pros-
pectors to the brazilian authorities this
sort of passport yo-yo had told chaptel
was easy enough to obtain he had a
mulatto friend in government service who
refused no request accompanied by a
twenty-franc gold coin

  the white commander tenente-lieu-
tenant-manoel da morea had been born
in rio he was as ragged as his men but
his manner was that of a perfect gentleman
he did his best to accommodate his un-
expected guests and took a particular lik-
ing to chaptel without anything being
said the officer had decided picard was

  

the head of the party pardon his guide
and marechal his servant yo-yo made
it clear that it would be best to leave him
under this impression and lavaud grum-
blingly assumed his re which consisted
chiefly in finishing the bottles from the
table

  manoel da morea spoke fluent french
had studied in paris had even represented
his country at maneuvers in france he
did not like the life in the outpost he de-
clared but a soldier had to take the bad
with the good he would not listen to
chaptels early departure and invited him
to remain a week under his roof to rest
as he put it from the arduous trip so ad-
venturously taken chaptel was aware that
the invitation was not free from self-interest
morea wanted to talk make up for his
months of loneliness he purchased the
gold with brazilian money which he paid
to chaptel yo-yo accepted half and told
chaptel he could keep the rest

  there is all of guiana to supply me with
more-and it has been pleasant to talk to a
man of the class i should have belonged
to he said

  morea who had many friends in the
brazilian government insisted that he
should write letters of introduction to the
officials in macapa in para and even in
rio if the prospector should care to visit
the metropolis in south america chaptel
hesitated to accept this proof of friendship
from a man he was deceiving but pro-
testation would have awakened sus-
picion

  morea expressed the opinion that one
must be uncomfortable in cayenne due to
the number of convicts there

  in my opinion he said they should
be shot instead of allowed to roam at large
lucky for them not one ever comes this
way i wouldnt waste much time with him
crack-gone morea pointed at lavaud
basking in the sun outside chatting with a
group of natives i spotted him hes a
free man and your servant now but he
was once one of them

  i think he was admitted chaptel
but hes a good old man now

  perhaps - perhaps beware of him
however hes too familiar with you
allow those dogs to take an inch and they
swallow you

  chaptel therefore hastened his departure
morea was not a fool from suspecting


adventure

lavaud to gradually suspecting him was
but a narrow step

  when he left he promised to write morea
and was compelled to give him a fictitious
address in france where morea declared
he would come to see him and renew the
pleasant friendship begun in the desolate
jungle on the banks of the aragouary a
last kindness he forced upon chaptel an
escort of four soldiers to protect him and
help him on the hard journey to macapa

  the distance between the outpost and
macapa was about ninety miles which yo-
yo said could be easily covered in a week
the road was bad partly through thick
brush partly over rough stony soil the
scenery was monotonous depressing but
it could be felt that they were nearing in-
habited areas they had been weeks with-
out glimpsing signs of a fire now when
night came they could see the reflection of
flames against the sky desultory cattle
grazing ineffectual attempts at agriculture
were the industries of the country-side
ragged vaqueiros mounted on gaunt ponies
passed the little party grinning in saluta-
tion yellow teeth in saddle-colored faces

  on the third day the sky being clear
chaptel perceived mountains in the dis-
tance yo-yo was satisfied with the prog-
ress made chaptel noticed that lavaud
sought every occasion to speak to the guide
in private and that the two engaged in long
arguments in which the old convict seemed
to be pleading and yo-yo refusing

  at length lavaud came to him

  i have asked coal-tar to take me back
with him as far as those creeks we saw
he wont do it

  are you crazy what difference is there
between suffering at the creeks and suffering
in cayenne youre too old to take any
more chances lavaud

  theres gold up there heaps of it since
i saw what we got in just a few days playing
around i know i could make enough to be
rich what is there for me in the world
if i have no money all i had went to
magre this way ill just be an old bum
without a friend on the whole earth

  you should have thought of that before
you started

  lavaud rubbed his chin musingly

  im not so sure that i wouldnt want to
go back to cayenne i feel that i wouldnt
die as long as i was planning to get out
again that keeps a fellow alive

  suddenly lavaud bent his head and
snuffed loudly to chaptels amazement
he began to sob

  come out of it old man chaptel in-
vited i didnt mean to be rough with
you

  what do i care about you lavaud re-
torted defiantly what i feel broken-
hearted over is that i wont have anything
to think of now im getting old and its
hard to get a new interest

  this absurd scene grated on chaptels
nerves here was lavaud actually home-
sick for cayenne and the isle of silence
missing the constant planning the longing
for freedom he seemed to want cayenne
even more than the gold

  go and talk to yo-yo chaptel sug-
gested

  but lavaud was discouraged he con-
tinued to weep his shoulders sagged and
he declared himself worn out chaptel was
for making a long halt but yo-yo declared
that he saw through the old mans trick
lavaud wanted to be left behind to wait
for yo-yos return and dog his steps back
to the alluring creeks and perhaps cayenne

  chaptel informed lavaud that yo-yo
never traveled the same road twice that he
would take a different route on the way
back he pointed out that the guide could
not afford to become too well known to
morea or any other officer for they would
suspect that the constantly changing pros-
pectors bound for macapa were not as in-
nocent as they pretended to be

  all right-walk on ill follow la-
vaud said meekly

  chaptel and yo-yo had to wait for him
repeatedly lavaud breathed loudly and
his face was white chaptel felt his head
his wrists and assured himself that it was
not fever that dragged so heavily upon the
senior member of the group he began to
worry anything was likely to happen to a
man of lavauds age after the arduous
journey through guiana

  he called a stop under a convenient tree
and lavaud threw himself on the ground
he never regained his feet again he be-
came delirious he seemed to have lost con-
sciousness of his surroundings and ad-
dressed himself to persons he had known
formerly and whom he thought were
near by

  how do you expect pigs to grow fat on
dish-water rosalie he shouted potato
knaves of spades

 

peelings old bread thats what they need
be quiet lavaud rest easy for today
and youll be all right in the morning

  monsieur le juge pleaded lavaud be-
fore an imaginary court of justice i didnt
shoot that game-keeper i swear i didnt
we had words the night before thats true
and he had arrested me for shooting a
rabbit but look at me am i a man that
would kill a game-keeper he was shot in
the morning and that morning i was on
the way to the fair with three pigs in the
wagon

  chaptel forced the spout of his canteen
between his teeth and poured down a long
drink of tafia strong alcohol parting gift of
lieutenant morea then he turned to
yo-yo-

  whats the matter with him

  i dont know i have seen others die
like that after they knew they were out
he isnt very strong i guess

   you think hell die

  yo-yo nodded

  chaptel shook lavaud trying to bring
him into momentary calm

  eh lavaud whats your address
where does that sister of yours live cant
you talk youre badly off and i guess
shed like to know what happened to
you

  i couldnt have shot him i was going
to the fair with three pigs in the wagon
what fair begged chaptel hoping to
get some indication of the town

  if the situation had been reversed he
would have wanted his family to be in-
formed rather than that they should worry
over a long-unexplained silence

  the country fair of course said
lavaud

   chaptel wiped his face

  where did you live lavaud what
did you do

  went to the fair with three pigs in a
wagon

  lavauds agony lasted several hours
his answers to chaptels questions never
varied the names of places he did men-
tion were so general that they could have
been apphed to any french village the
golden lion cafe the store next to the
church the old house near the fountain
these could not be called precisions when
night came yo-yo made a fire and chaptel
still watched by the old man hoping against
hope that he would have a lucid moment

  at last lavaud sat up bruskly with an
indignant gesture

  how could i with three pigs in a

wagon

  he sank back his jaw dropped

and chaptel who had not shed
a tear in years cried over the old
fellow he had never heard of
the game-keeper and knew that
lavaud was quite capable of lying to him-
self even in an unconscious condition the
man had lived hard suffered greatly-and
he was dead under the stars in this lonesome
corner of the immense forest

  the soldiers who had been lagging be-
hind arrived at noon the next day they
consented to dig a grave not overdeep
however for they soon tired yo-yo re-
moved his hat ceremoniously and said a
prayer in latin the soldiers knelt and
chaptel imitated them the guide pro-
ceeded unctuously his words resounding
under the trees	

  amen yo-yo ended then without
transition we can go now	

  the soldiers crossed themselves a
time then evidently fearing a fate similar
to that of lavaud if they hurried unduly
found comfortable resting places by the
road not twenty feet from the newly made
grave and went to sleep

  four days later the two reached macapa
from which yo-yo informed chaptel a
steam-boat would take him down the ama-
zon river to santa-maria de belem de grao
para known as belem to the convicts and as
para to the brazilians

  yo-yo did not enter the city

  i stop here he announced

  you start back right away

  yes i never enter the place i do not
care to be well known it is better that
you should go in alone

  then im all alone

  youre luckier than the others who have
no money and are compelled to join the
beachcombers you have money for the
gold and can buy your passage for belem
there ships come from all parts of the
world good luck

  he turned without another word and
strode back in the direction from which they
had come chaptel saw the tall massive
figure round a clump of orange trees and
his last connection with cayenne and his
former life was gone


adventure

  he was puzzled half-afraid to enter the
town he had an uncertain feeling of be-
ing naked for he was deprived of compan-
ionship and in a strange place but he
stepped forward resolutely entered the
first cafe showed the letters of introduction
was conducted to the fort where a friend of
morea received him cordially and de-
clared himself willing to serve as mentor
until he was safely on the river steamer
bound for para

  the way opened wide for him where
would he go should he stay in brazil or
seek a new life elsewhere

  come with me monsieur picard his
host suggested i wish you to tell my
friends of your adventures in the bad
woods well open a bottle or two and
show you that if macapa is not paris a good
drink makes for a cheerful evening

whats wrong with you pic-
ard henri zimmer asked sud-
denly

awit	with me chaptel repeated

i hats wrong the heat i guess
she heat of the immense city seemed in
fact to pour in through the open window and
fill the small room from wall to wall the
cigaret smoke clung to the dingy curtains
and shredded lazily toward the airshaft
the clang of metal the rattle of the ele-
vated on ninth avenue new york city
added din to the heat chaptel naked lay
on the bed trying to sleep zimmer the
alsatian occupied a worn easy chair read-
ing a newspaper absent-mindedly smoking
cigaret after cigaret the intervals being
filled by long swallows of beer

  that doesnt sound true to me picard
he insisted look here ive known you
almost a year you think im a friend of
yours dont you cant you tell me what
ails you lately

  a year chaptel said musingly that
long zimmer

  sure

  chaptel sighed pulled the top sheet as
far as his armpits and sighed again

  he had been in new york twelve months
it was therefore almost two years since he
had entered macapa since he had left yo-
yo yes it must be two years for the
nightmares in which he was recaptured by
the police disturbed him no longer

  in belem he had avoided mixing with the
other escaped men on the beach moreas

letters made a path for him he had gained
port of spain trinidad and new orleans
without difficulty then his money had
given out

  at the time he could speak but a few
words of english and fell back upon the
french sailors on shore leave for help he
told them that circumstances made it im-
possible for him to ship on a french vessel
and that he wished to reach new york
they presumed him to be a deserter from a
merchant steamer and having had mo-
ments when they themselves had been tired
of their surroundings understood

  through them chaptel became acquaint-
ed with a frenchman who held the position
of cook on an american vessel chaptel
realized the need of some sort of trade and
stayed with him until he had mastered the
elements of the culinary art at last
thinking himself equipped to face life in
the north american metropolis he shook
hands with the cook and went ashore

  there are many frenchmen in hotel
kitchens in new york but they form a
closed fraternity and unless a man has the
proper introductions he finds it hard to get
work chaptel found people colder and
colder toward a petitioner for help the
further north he had traveled he was
turned away everywhere and his last dollar
dwindled to two dimes and a nickel

  at this critical moment a sign in the
window of a lunch counter on west street
near the docks attracted his attention a
dish-washer was wanted chaptel entered
agreed to the conditions laid down by the
proprietor which he could not understand
his knowledge of english still being limited
and he washed dishes thick cups thick
plates evidently made for length of service
greasy tin forks spoons heaps of them for
sixteen hours a day he was free and bet-
ter off than in guiana but still this was not
his idea of happiness

  he was lonely every night he walked
up and down west street at times as far as
the chelsea docks where he could meet
french sailors from the pier on fifteenth
street these men showed him little
sympathy the down and outers were too
numerous to be listened to he had no
chance to explain that he did not want
money but the sound of his own tongue j

  at last he halted zimmer who was re-
turning from a lengthy visit to a steward
zimmer was happy cheerful he told
knaves of spades



chaptel that he had also tasted bitter mo-
ments

  chaptel introduced himself as picard
thinking the name given him by yo-yo as
good as any together they had gone to an
arm-chair restaurant and talked matters
over zimmer was an alsatian when he
was two years old his family emigrated to a
manufacturing town in connecticut his
french was far from musical-he mixed it
with german and english words but his
heart was good

  he immediately acquired a sense of re-
sponsibility over his casual acquaintance
scoffed at the idea that chaptel should go
back to dish-washing in the morning he
took him to his room and declared that from
this night onward he and chaptel would be
friends that he guaranteed him a job as
bus-boy in the cabaret where he was em-
ployed

  chaptel soon became a full-fledged waiter
he was tall good looking and was granted
the privilege of serving tables near the
dancing floor where tips are heaviest

  as soon as he had saved a sufficient
amount of money he declared his intention
of leaving his position to look for work in a
garage as he had some mechanical training
zimmer could not understand this picard
was making good money he declared more
than he could make at any other trade
moreover it would separate them for
zimmer would work nights and picard
days chaptel sacrificed his personal in-
clinations and remained with his friend

  he did not like waiting-not from a false
pride but because it did not require the use
of his fingers in the intricate manner ma-
chinery demanded but zimmer had been
kind to him and he did not want to annoy
him in the slightest manner it can not be
said that he was unhappy he had come to
appreciate good food clean living quarters
and personal liberty the petty annoy-
ances were nothing to what he had endured
the scolding of the majestic head-waiter
was mild compared to the bitter tongue
lashings of marietti bichet and magre

  the growling of the gentleman who want-
ed to impress his companion with his ex-
acting sense of proper table service he met
politely he had the ready smile for the
well-known patron who beamed his satis-
faction at public recognition from a man
employed in the gayest place in town the
former costaud was often threatened with

bodily violence by inebriate gentlemen
he learned that a rush order consisted of a
swift search for left-overs

  he had informed his father of his suc-
cessful escape he corresponded with his
parents cautiously had assigned a general
delivery address for his mail and he was
homesick desperately homesick he strug-
gled against that feeling told himself that
lavaud had been recaptured through grati-
fying a like impulse to go back home
would almost certainly mean walking into
a trap

  and zimmer was asking him what was
the matter

  come on picard whats wrong zim-
mer repeated

  to tell the truth im homesick

  you have enough money for your fare to
france and back i have a few dollars that
would be better off in circulation take
the next boat and visit your folks

  i cant go back

  zimmer pursed his lips whistled

  you ducked your military service did
you

  something of the kind

  how long ago did you leave

  about seven years ago

  would many people know your face
i think ive changed a lot i was not
much more than a kid then

  suppose you grew a mustache a beard
even anyway you wouldnt need to go
into the place where youd lived stay at a
place some distance away and get your folks
to come and see you

  im afraid that i might be questioned
i have no papers

  thats easy said zimmer ill give
you my birth certificate and a bunch of let-
ters written to me youll be henry zim-
mer german subject born in alsace
chaptel propped himself up on one elbow
could i get away with it

  why not

  and you

  i have my american citizenship papers
thats all i need

  chaptel reached over and grasped his
hand

  only you better be careful and not visit
alsace the germans would pull you into
the army as quick as a wink and with
your temper you could never stand being
bossed about by a thick-necked sergeant
you cant imagine what army life is like i


adventure

had a brother who stayed in the old country
you ought to hear him tell about it
kicks-swear-words  

  chaptel smiled then his face set stern-
ly could he accept zimmers identity
and leave him in ignorance of his former
life it was a great temptation to take the
papers and keep silent but presuming the
worst happened and he was caught by the
french police what would zimmer think
no he had full right to risk his own
liberty but no right to destroy a mans
faith in humanity

  i guess thats all a dream he declared
wearily cant be done

  zimmer was almost violent in his in-
sistence his accent in french was terrific
and chaptel thought he saw a way out

  listen zimmer i cant speak ger-
man

  its only right that you dont speak
german zimmer pointed out triumph-
antly you left home when you were
two years old youll be one poor fel-
low from the land that was lost in the war
everybody will say youre right not to speak
that pig german language no

  chaptel was forced to admit the logic of
this argument there was but one way to
make zimmer understand

  if i told you i had been a convict zim-
mer would you still want me to use your
birth certificate

  it was some time before zimmer re-
covered from his astonishment

  what others say you did what you
did i dont care zimmer said i like
you and thats all i want to know

  you might get into trouble

  youre the hardest fellow to do a favor
for i evermet sputtered zimmer may-
be you think it is this way if zimmer had
been in sing sing he would not be your
friend no yes he would the alsa-
tian nevertheless caught some of chaptels
emotion and his voice became throaty
have a glass of beer thats good in hot
weather

  chaptel held up his glass in silence

  all was settled-on the surface but it
would need more than a birth certificate
and a plausible story to clear him if he were
suspected to go back was sheer madness
the much criticised french police counts
among its members genuinely intelligent
men peculiarly gifted for their calling one
glance at his nose his forehead his eyes and

the recollection of a small photograph seen
on a filing card- chaptel would not know
of this he would go on living quietly be-
coming more and more secure and feel a
hand on his shoulder just when he would
least expect it

  the identification the convict-ship cay-
enne the trial which would add five years to
the eight earned through striking bichet-
the dreaded mark would be passed and his
doublage would swallow the rest of his life
the isle of silence the bush attempted
escape the isle of silence again he might
never succeed in escaping for there was not
always at hand a greedy magre of a ma-
niacal yo-yo an endless round that
would be his until he was thrown into the
sea to the sharks

  or again lavauds fate death in the
forest delirium

  three pigs in a wagon

  but the homing instinct was too strong
could not be denied chaptel was able to
face chance calmly for the sake of seeing
his people his home a strange thing is
man guided by instincts that are not al-
ways for his good instincts that he can not
resist

  two weeks later he sailed for havre

        in the deserted waiting-room
of the station he paused to ex-
jbgfipk amine himself in the mirror sur-
mounting a machine which sup-
plied chocolate for the insignificant sum of
two sous he remembered this particular
machine there had been a time when he
was compelled to stand on tip-toes to insert
the coin in the slot he cleared his throat
with a hearty cough unwilling to admit the
emotion that gripped him

  it was not likely that he would be recog-
nized the nine days on the sea had
browned his face he was certain that he
had grown taller heavier and the black
mustache completed the change from the
loose-limbed pink-cheeked lad who had
left seven years before he turned down
the brim of his felt hat buttoned his light
top coat to the throat and swung out into
the open place before the station

  the gendarme on duty small and fat
chaptel had known he had once arrested
him for throwing stones at the pigeons near
the town hall his heart stood still when
the uniformed man brought his hand to the
peak of his cap he had forgotten that
knaves of spades



greetings were tendered to strangers in his
home town

  bonjour monsieur said the gendarme

  bonjour

  the officer was loquacious and volun-
teered the facts that the day promised to be
clear that he could see the gentleman was a
stranger in town and that he took it upon
himself to recommend the inn three streets
down from the station omelets-one
would smack his lips three hours after eat-
ing those omelets and the wine that
tasted like nothing but radiant sunshine in
ones soul

  what is the name of that inn asked
chaptel who could not have passed it less
than a thousand times

  the silver bell say that hamel the
gendarme sent you

  merci-au revoir

  chaptel entered the inn of the silver
bell and ordered omelet and wine he had
eaten shortly before at a preceding station
but thought it best to conduct himself in
this leisurely and carefree manner the
serving maid grumbled at the unusual
hour it lacked forty minutes of six

  chaptel strolled out once more and by
circling through many streets made his way
toward his old home the milk carts
drawn by large dogs were the only vehi-
cles on the move chaptel recognized the
woman who had always brought milk to his
home he had spent a three weeks vaca-
tion at her farm once but she did not
recognize him nothing had changed but
himself

  the town seemed smaller of course
ridiculously small he had seen large cities
and was rather disappointed distances
had shrunk apparently for he soon found
himself standing before his own door
it was unlocked he remembered that
the man on the top floor a retired army
officer went for a walk at four oclock
every morning he must be still alive and
still walking for there was the street door
open

  the semi-darkness of the stair-case the
smell of dust and polishing oil seemed fa-
miliar as did the feel of the round hard-
wood ball ending the last pole of the ban-
nister

  the third step creaks he told himself
and avoided the third step as he had done
in other days when coming back too late
for parental approval

  third floor-here we are he whispered

   he stood before the door his heart beat-
ing savagely shaking him like the vibra-
tion of a motor

  he tried the handle the door was not
locked he opened the panel through
the hall he could see the little dining room
the same carpet the black-wood buffet he
could see a corner of a picture a colored
print depicting a herd of cows in a grassy
field with slim poplars lining the horizon
not daring to move he stood there back
against the wall breathing hard

  he noticed a change the furniture was
dusty a dreadful fear crept into his
heart some one was moving in the
kitchen he heard the clatter of a coffeepot
being replaced on the stove then a step
that of his father crossed the floor

  chaptel saw him he had aged-his
mustache was white his face was lined
and he was preparing his own breakfast
there was no woman in the house no
french woman would have permitted him to
lay a hot dish on the table top without pro-
tection for the wood chaptel felt the tears
roll down his nose this was what he had
feared his mother was dead she had
not been able to survive all the anxieties he
had caused her he had killed her as surely
as if he had driven a knife into her heart
he was inclined to close the door without
saying a word take the next train out of
town and return to america

  but his father had seen him he started
and challenged the intruder

  what do you want cant you knock
instead of creeping in like a thief you
made my heart jump

  chaptel walked into the room and stood
in the light of the window

  dont you know me monsieur chap-
tel

  edmond thunder

 mother-

   hebroke off and could not go on

  whats wrong with her

  she isnt- she isnt-

  no shes spending a few weeks in the
country she was sick for a while when we
didnt hear from you but when she knew
you were safe in new york she got better
did any one see you coming in here

  no

  right after you escaped i had two or
three visits i thought it was one of the
police come back againjvhen i saw you


adventure

  theyre watching

  not always but every once in a while
an inspector of police comes around ive
been careful of the letters i sent you
though

  chaptel showed him his papers and ex-
plained how he got them

  its not safe for me to stay near here
he said ill go to belfort near the border
i can be in alsace in two jumps

  then he sat down and told his father of
his escape

  thunder youve traveled mon ptit
youve traveled the old man said envi-
ously you know ive always wanted to
do that sort of thing but i got married
then you came that yo-yo now how
old did you say he was

  chaptel gave the desired details his
fathers eyes glowed

  what are you doing now chaptel
asked still at the same place

  yes my employer says business is slow
people are nervous around here since
that austrian fellow was shot two weeks
ago theres been talk of war if it comes
to a head you can get back to america in
time he shrugged sadly thats all
you care to do i guess the army and
france have been pretty bad for you

  he seemed to feel the humiliation keenly
having a boy that could not serve in case the
long-expected war broke out at last

  you better not stay here too long the
old man advised theres a train tonight
at eleven for belfort you had the good
sense to come early going out late you
stand the same chance of not being dis-
covered

  he glanced at his watch

  im due at the office i dont dare stay
away some one might come to see what
was the matter ill try to get off early
in the meanwhile theres enough to eat in
the kitchen

after he was gone chaptel
who was not hungry sat down in
the arm chair war would not
come he told himself how
many times within his memory had it been
predicted in his boyhood he had seen
troops rush through the streets in the mid-
dle of the night bound for the border all
these rumors had dwindled and the fighting
had not started this was but another
scare

  he spent the day rumaging through
drawers reading old books his father re-
turned at nightfall laden with packages
there was roast chicken bottles of olives
and cherries truffles two quarts of pomard
cognac and the cigarets that he had pre-
fered

  i took the chance that no one would
suspect that you were my company for to-
night the old man grinned your
mother would feed you and i guess thats
what i should do

  at quarter of eleven he took his leave and
went to the station hamel was not there
the gendarme on duty paid no attention
to him in another five minutes he was
safe in a compartment of the train rolling
toward belfort

  several days elapsed before his mother
came doubtless the father had tempered
her impatience and warned her against too
great haste in the mean while chaptel
was bored the music halls did not inter-
est him he was longing to be back in new
york where he would be free from the
haunting fear of arrest and the sense of
impending calamity was in the air troops
were pouring by night into the city officers
strutted about with a preoccupied air
gendarmes and policemen were scanning
strangers with keen eyes scenting possible
spies even when he had explained to his
landlord that although his name was zim-
mer he was not german but an alsatian
the man had not appeared satisfied almost
any moment he might expect to be taken to
police headquarters and questioned

  he momentarily forgot his worries when
his mother arrived she could not hear
enough of his wanderings exclaimed angrily
over magre pityingly over lavaud and
said that henri zimmer was the best man
alive chaptel knew that she should re-
turn immediately and that he should go
but he did not have the courage to tell her

  the order of mobilization came on the
second of august  belfort was an
important point in the defense of the french
eastern frontier the first surge of the
german attack was expected here

  you cant go into germany now his
mother said you better take the next
train into switzerland while there is still
time then you can go down into italy
and get a boat to america

  chaptel went to the window on the
street soldiers were marching the day
knaves of spades



before they had seeftted ridiculous in their
baggy garish clothing now they swung
together like a machine with a set look upon
their faces straining forward war was in
the future and was all glory and triumph
the air was as if charged with electricity
the united energy emanating from these
young men swept chaptel strangely he
shook like a leaf the bugles caught at
something within him strings that had
never vibrated and suddenly it seemed
monstrous that any men not french should
come into belfort into his home while he
was forced to run away

  right by fours-march

  the voice of a sergeant with a ring
identical to that of marietti but chaptel
stiffened at the command

  my- mother im afraid i cant run

away

  why not

  i dont know what to say-how to ex-
plain i know its crazy for me to want to
do anything for a nation thats crushed me
-all that was worth while in me--i know
this will make more worry for you but i
cant go

  youre no longer french guiana has
unnaturalized you edmond youre your-
self thats all

  the shrill yell of a woman pierced
through the pounding of feet

  vive la france

  chaptel struck his head with his hands
tears came to his eyes

  im crazy im crazy he shouted i
know what france has done to me i know
that those poor fools will get killed for
some one else i know all that and here
i am caught by it vive la france shout-
ting it means much the same for me as
shouting-vive la guyane vive biribi
vive bichet marietti magre

  his mother was silent not urging him to
either course

  what would you want me to do
mother he asked helplessly stay go
what i havent the strength to make a
decision you say what you want what
you think is right

  edmond god knows i dont want you
to be killed i dont want you to suffer any
more but the others are going she be-
gan to weep quietly and heaven for-
give me i want you to go with them-be-
cause i love you-its hard to say hard to
understand why i guess its one of those

things like the tides of the sea that you just
cant help some time some one may in-
vent something better than ones country
-but i- i -

  chaptel laughed he remembered the
cayenne saying about the flag the flag now
passing beneath the window red white and
blue red with blood white with fear blue
with sickness liberty equality fra-
ternity liberty to die of hunger equality in
misery and cain-like fraternity france
marching at the head of civilization with
the unnamable horrors of guiana straggling
behind his reason rebelled but his heart
was trapped

  im going--im going then he hesi-
tated but how can i im not con-
sidered fit to fight im a convict

  you have zimmers papers

  under his name he could not go into
a french regiment would have to enter the
foreign legion he paused dazzled
the foreign legion-theres a recruiting
bureau here-a man told me so in the bat
daf right or wrong im going-now this
afternoon

  his mother between dabs at her
eyes with her handkerchief had packed
her baggage he closed his bags with
alacrity

  ill put you in a cab for the station
mother you go home and tell the old man
i fell for his stuff thatll crack a grin out
of him you take my bags with you i
wont need them-until its over-for every-
body or for me

  a few minutes and the parting was over
as chaptel looked after the cab as it dis-
appeared around the corner he involun-
tarily thought of yo-yo vanishing around
the orange-tree clump then he was going
into a new life now also

        within two hours he was a
member of the foreign legion
and in the belfort barracks
awaiting his assignment to a
central unit grinning boys-many of
them reminded him of zimmer-chatted in
german they were alsatians at the
last moment the queer call had come to
them they had felt that their place was with
the french two days later he left belfort
for the rear areas for lyons on the train
he heard various rumors the french had
smashed the german army in alsace had
taken mulhausen which was again called


adventure

mulhouse the gray tide of prussians ba-
varians saxons was flooding through
belgium liege was holding out he
wrote to his parents his first doubts had
vanished his whole soul was in the fight

  the letter from his mother came the
first paragraphs were the usual news his
mother was hoping that he would not be
hurt that all would be over before his time
came then in the next line she told him
that she knew he would distinguish himself
chaptel smiled thinking that she wanted
nothing less than a war with the maximum
of success and honors and the minimum of
danger for her only son

  the last item made him start -

  there is a providence watching over you ed-
mond when i got to the station i saw many
gendarmes and policemen they were arresting
men bound for switzerland it seems that no one
whose business is not absolutely clear will escape
investigation i am sure that if you had tried to go
you would have been caught and sent back to that
awful place i was still wondering at the time why
i told you to go i guess i felt it inside me as we
mothers do

  lucky theres a providence for men
with careless mothers chaptel muttered
if that letter had been ripped open by an
officer id be in a mess looking more
closely at the envelope he saw a seal that
of his battalion commander the letter
had been opened

  this meant another few days worry for
him needless worry it proved for
after an inspection previous to entraining
for the front the major beckoned to chap-
tel

  your name is henri zimmer

  oui mon commandant

  youre an alsatian arent you

  chaptel breathed an answer

  then youre in the right place the
major went on i expect great things from
you my lad alsatians are our best sol-
diers

         for two years chaptel fought
in all the engagements in which
the foreign legion took part
he was with the men who went
over the top in the units initial assault in
the great war on december nd 
north of prunay during the retaking of
zouaves wood on the th of may 
he left the trenches of france and with the
others entered the famous white works or
hill  he saw majors noire muller and

gaubert fall he was alive and unhurt at
the end

  in the legion there was no half-way
mark either one distinguished ones self or
was killed chaptel came out and was
decorated medaille militaire and the in-
separable croix de guerre september 
 he went forward again in the fierce
assault that just fell short of ending the
war he was a sergeant then he took a
satisfactory part in the attack on navarin
farm and the fighting in the wood about
that place the cross of the legion of
honor joined the first two

  these engagements had taken many men
the two regiments of the legion were re-
formed into one under lieutenant-colonel
cot as part of the celebrated moroccan
division the regiment was called when
veteran troops were needed troops that
could suffer immense losses and keep after
their objective there never has existed
throughout the history of the world a bet-
ter fighting aggregation than the war time
legion etrangere

  in july  chaptel received his first
wound a shell splinter in the left side
that was during the bayonet charge into
belloy he took this opportunity to ask
for a transfer into the aviation his record
the intelligence he had shown in handling
situations within his scope made this easy
january  found him an adjutant pilot
of a chase plane

  his success was almost immediate he
had that rare gift a flying sense he was
at once cool and audacious he had the
mental balance to discriminate between
necessary daring and rashness a mis-
sion entrusted to him was fulfilled

  it was the custom in his squad to paint a
distinguishing design on the individual
planes when asked what mark he pre-
fered chaptel impulsively suggested a huge
pip of spades many thought this a con-
ceit chaptel was considered an ace for he
had long before brought down his fifth
plane

  the design caught the fancy of the troop-
ers in the trenches they referred to him as
las de pique the ace of spades and in-
variably saluted when he flew over among
men in the service he was well known well
liked his unselfishness was proverbial a
tale ran the rounds of the various fields a
very young pilot newly decorated due for
leave had evidenced traces of nervousness
knaves of spades



before his last flight chaptel had just re-
turned from a flight over the lines had
hoisted himself into the boys machine and
before any protest could be made was off

  as is the way other decorations added to
the first three a trip to northern france
on the small sector held by the combined
french and belgian forces had netted him
the british cross and two belgian crosses
in the courteous exchange of decorations by
various allied governments he reaped a rich
harvest

  of the end of the war he never thought
there was little possibihty that he would
escape death men as able as he were being
brought down every day but his luck was
holding firm

  late in  he was summoned by his
flight commander a reporter for l illus-
tration asked for an interview and a pho-
tograph

  nothing doing he told the officer
shortly you know i avoid that sort of
thing mon commandant its a principle
with me

  you know zimmer this excessive mod-
esty borders on conceit your comrades
submit to the ordeal and you should
moreover you dont belong to yourself but
to the aviation your fame is also that of
your comrades i dont know if i am quite
qualified to give you orders on that score
but i wish you would do as i suggest

   chaptel hesitated

   i cannot allow my picture to be printed
he declared i realize that my behavior
seems queer but i assure you major it
is best for me to remain in obscurity

   whats at the back of all this zimmer
the officer asked bruskly you evidently
fear recognition youve known me several
months i have seen you rise from adjutant
to lieutenant and you know that you have
acquired my esteem something more than
a youthful pecadillo is needed to change me
dont allow your face to be published but
trust me im not curious i take you for
what you are but im sure that things
are not as grave as they seem to you

  they are major first of all my name
is not henri zimmer
i i suspected as much give me credit
for a little intelligence whats that dread
secret of yours

  im an ex-convict no not even that
an escaped convict im wanted in cay-
enne

  no more than here i dont believe you
stole

  no major

  then you killed a man for private rea-
sons you have to my knowledge killed
thirty-eight for france the nation should
forgive one killing in exchange for thirty-
eight the war has altered things if
you havent earned a pardon ill turn
monk i congratulate you in advance

lieutenant-

  he hesitated

  edmond chaptel but i never achieved
distinction as a criminal major

  he went on and explained his position
the officer listened until he was through
then shrugged something wrong with our
laws he said the chief culprit seems to
be the government which does not separate
the accidental offender from the hardened
criminal

  chaptel smiled

  before the war major if i had told you
my story what would you have said if i
were not decorated on every seam what
would you think of me

  what i do now you were a misguided
kid thats the story you trot out give
the interview pause for the photographer
im due for a leave tomorrow ill see men
i know in paris will go as far as the presi-
dent if need be and ill be back with a full
pardon and rehabilitation papers before a
week do you want to change your name
no it was good enough to protect me
ill keep it while in the army theres a
private in the american army who is glad
that i bear that name he claims me as a
cousin the name sticks

the major was as good as his
word he brought back the
promised pardon there had
been little difficulty the ques-
tion of rehabilitating men who had fought
for france had been discussed a law
would ultimately be passed by the cham-
bers to effect this automatically

  it was passed and is known as the law
of march  

  the article concerning lieutenant zim-
mer ace of spades appeared in lillustra-
tion chaptel grinned when he saw his
likeness and imagined the effect of marietti
bichet and magre should the magazine ever
come into their hands and provided the war
had spared them


adventure

   the publicity had one unforeseen result
however a staff machine drove into the
yard and chaptel was summoned it was
lespart who had acquired the rank of
major-and lost an arm

   chaptel explained everything

  they talked of the prison camp les-
part had not lost interest in the penal ques-
tion but the changing of rules and habit
would be hard to perform as long as men
wished to defeat the well-intentioned mea-
sures of the higher officers sergeants would
become brutal and costauds would flourish

  chaptel who was not altogether free
from superstition felt that his luck had been
pushed too hard and he was right what
his enemies could not do a stupid accident
managed to accomplish returning from a
flight over the lines a stay on his machine
snapped somehow strangled into the whirl
of the propeller-and chaptel broke both
legs

  followed months in the hospitals his
legs set slowly there were longer months
convalescing moving about on crutches
but this had a compensation it gave his
parents a chance to exhibit him slowly
but surely the rumor spread that he had
been unjustly condemned to the batd af
and that the president of the republic him-
self had apologized for the mistake

  at last he was permitted to resume
 service not at the front however but in
the aviation school at pau his request
for action was accepted too late for him to
return to the front the armistice was
signed

  he located zimmer the reunion was
attended with much drinking and reminis-
cent joking the alsatian however was
never quite at ease until the two doffed
their coats in the seclusion of the hotel room
to smoke drink beer and play cards even
then every few minutes zimmer would
beam

   eh my birth certificate it brings you
luck

  months later chaptel was in paris
leaving a dinner party early to take a train
home where he had been promised employ-
ment in a manufacturing plant he was con-
cious of being followed

   a nervousness he had not felt for years
crept over him turning swiftly around a
corner he managed to catch a glimpse of

his pursuer duval there was no mistak-
ing his first action was undignified he
ran the instinct had been too strong
people he jostled looked at him in surprize
he realized that he still wore a uniform
he should be through with craven actions
by now

  he stopped and waited

  duval wore a uniform that of a corporal
of infantry

  duval saluted

  i recognized you mon lieutenant and i
thought id say hello for old times sake
how are you duval what are you
doing

  my term was up in sixteen and i was
sent to the front with the battalion i be-
haved myself as you see im a corporal
already and will be a sergeant soon im
only thirty-eight and in fifteen years can be
pensioned duval paused embarrassed
about what happened-back there-it was
all a mistake you werent one of us but
i didnt know

  there was a silence neither man knew
what to say next duval recovered first
again he saluted

  good-by mon lieutenant 

  left alone chaptel walked rapidly he
must make that train the position might
not be open for long

  strange thing he mused duval
turning honest and straight but-i feel
sorry for him the other way he was more
-more himself-more picturesque

  he could find no words to fit his senti-
ment was not a placid sergeant of in-
fantry better than a knave of spades and
yet duval seemed like a lion in a cage

  what about me chaptel asked himself
suddenly do i fit in as a manager of a
factory isnt it just as ridiculous for me
to go back and live like a middle-aged man
of leisure

  he halted suddenly-the vision of long
years of steady work never moving from
the narrow bounds of his native town he
stood still heedless of the crowd brushing
by him then swiftly he made his de-
cision entered a cafe sought a telephone

  a well-known voice answered

  hello major said chaptel ive
changed my mind still time to enter a
plane in that paris-dakar flight yes-fine
-yes major three days from now--
infernal ingenuity

by arthur woodward

s omewhere in the oozy mud of
the hudson river near the city of
yonkers new york lies the rot-
-j ting wreckage of a small sloop
in that wreckage reposes the oaken rem-
nants of the turtle the first submarine ever
used by the united states in warfare against
an invading enemy

 in the early autumn of  when gen-
eral washington was laying plans for the
defense of manhattan island against the
combined land and sea forces of lord howe
and his hessian allies david bushnell an
inventive young genius of saybrook con-
necticut brought before washington the
plans for an underwater vessel to be used
in the destruction of the english shipping
in new york harbor

 this extraordinary machine according
to an account given in the journal of dr
james thacher a surgeon in the conti-
nental army was constructed of wood and
the external appearance of the torpedo
bears some resemblance to two upper tor-
toise shells of equal size placed in contact
leaving at that part which represents the
head of the animal a flue or opening
sufficiently capacious to contain the oper-
ator and to support him thirty minutes

  at the bottom opposite the entrance was
a quantity of lead for ballast the opera-
tor sat upright using one oar for rowing
either forward or backward and was also
provided with a rudder for steering his craft

 a valve in the floor compartment ad-
mitted water when the operator wished to
descend and it is related that the tiny ship
could descend with ease to any depth and
rise to the surface when the water was
ejected through two brass force pumps it
was rendered perfectly water-tight through-
out and was equipped with glass windows
for the admission of light and with ventila-
tors and air pipes to be used when the craft
was running awash with the surface

  in the rear of the submarine just over
the rudder was located the torpedo
made of two pieces of oak timber hollowed
out and filled with  pounds of powder
with a clockwork attachment on the in-
side which was only released when the

magazine was unscrewed by the operator
the clockwork was so arranged that it
could be fired any time within twelve hours
by the gun lock attachment connected with
the explosive a wooden screw for the
purpose of fastening the infernal machine
to the bottom or side of the target was also
manipulated by the pilot after he had
drilled a hole with the augur carried for that
special work

  the turtle gave promise of revolution-
izing naval warfare and both general
washington and major-general israel put-
nam who was in charge of the defense prep-
arations of the city at the time were keenly
interested in the curious invention

  when the vessel was finally completed
and tested out it was determined by gen-
eral putnam to put it into good use the
first vessel picked as the victim was the
british flag-ship eagle a handsome man-
of-war of sixty-four guns then lying at
anchor in the inner bay not far from
governors island

  it so happened that bushnells brother
who had been instructed in the operation
of the submarine was taken suddenly sick
sergeant ezra lee afterwards made a
captain of a connecticut regiment was
hastily initiated into the mysteries of the
mechanics of the craft he embarked one
night in october  with the powder
magazine in place ready to blow up the
proud ship of the line

  sergeant lee submerged and reached the
eagle in safety unfortunately in at-
tempting to drill a hole in the wooden
timbers near the rudder hinge he struck an
iron bar passing from the rudder hinge to
the ships quarter and was unable to at-
tach the wooden screw a movement of
his hand six inches one way or the other
would have crowned his efforts with suc-
cess but the sergeant unused to maneuver-
ing around under the keel of a british war-
ship lost all sense of direction and in
shifting the position of his craft lost the
british ship also

  after seeking her in vain by groping at
random under the water he finally ascended
to the surface some distance from the


adventure

ship and finding daylight well advanced
thought it imprudent to renew the attempt
and set out for the shore on passing
governors island then occupied by the
enemy he feared he was discovered and
imagining that the torpedo retarded his
progress cast it off it exploded one hour
later throwing a vast column of water to
an amazing height in the air and leaving
the enemy to conjecture whether the stu-
pendous noise was produced by a bomb a
meteor a waterspout or an earthquake

  lack of resources put an end to further
experimentation the submarine with a
new torpedo was loaded on a small sloop
which for safety sake was anchored under the
protection of the guns of fort washington

  treachery on the part of deserters from
the garrison in fort washington or the in-
formation of spies caused the british fleet
which had hitherto remained practically in-
active during the construction of the ob-
struction across the hudson river at
jeffrys hook where the light house now
stands to get ready for sudden action

  early on the morning of wednesday
october th not long after the unsuccessful
attempt to blow up the eagle the british
frigate phoenix accompanied by the roebuck
a frigate of thirty-two guns the tartar of
twenty guns and three tenders stood up
the river towards fort washington frighten-
ing the sloop bearing the submarine and
another schooner laden with sugar and run
into hasty flight

  the contest was unequal the schooner
was speedily captured while the sloop which
had reached a point opposite yonkers was
sent to the bottom with a few well directed
shots where it probably lies to this day
thus ended the first attempt at submarine
warfare in north american waters

another ingenious use of an
infernal machine in the early
days occurred when the first
flood of emigrants pushing west-
ward over the alleghanies at the conclu-
sion of the revoluntionary war spread out
along the timbered creeks and lowlands of
kentucky and ohio the salt springs on
salt creek a tributary of the scioto not
far from chillicothe were deemed rare
prizes

  prior to the coming of the whites the
indians frequented the licks and ob-
tained their supply of salt from them

after the whites came the indians used the
springs as points of ambush and many a
luckless settler lost his scalp or was car-
ried into captivity when seeking the
precious salt

  the old scioto salt works were among
the first worked by the whites in ohio
having been known and recognized on
maps since  in the year  wells
were sunk to the depth of about thirty feet
and the salt obtained from the evaporation
of the water was taken from the kettles on
packhorses to the various settlements and
sold for three or fouj dollars per bushel
this practise was continued until as late as
 in fact so important were these
springs considered that when ohio was
formed into a state in  congress
enacted a measure setting aside a tract six
miles square embracing the springs in
order that the new state might benefit from
the revenue thereof

    as might be expected the regular
workers of the salt works when the lots
along the creek were rented by the state to
private owners were a coarse reckless set
on par with the charcoal burners and boat-
men

  it was among this roystering crew that
an expression originated which existed in
ohio until after  namely to shoot one
with a pack saddle the saying came
about in this manner

  a traveller having come on horseback
for some distance to the scioto salt works
to purchase salt had his pack saddle stolen
by the boilers and used in the furnace for
fuel being outnumbered and realizing
that he could obtain no legitimate redress
from such a crowd he loaded his horse with
salt and went his way determining how-
ever not to be caught napping a second
time

  not long afterward he again had occasion
to make the journey to the works and on
making camp threw his pack saddle care-
lessly to one side and prepared to pass the
night when the boilers thought he was
asleep they again stole his saddle and
threw it into the furnace it had been
there but a short time when a terrific ex-
plosion ensued and furnace boilers and all
appliances were hurtled in every direction
the saddle had been carefully loaded with
gunpowder needless to say the salt pur-
chaser never lost another pack saddle at
that camp

author of mustang breed the three missing men etc

 vv hiskers beck very deliber-
 ately turned where he sat and
vv subjected bob crowe of the
lll j z to a curious stare then
he snickered faintly and turned away

 now just what the - demanded

bob crowe testily do you mean by that
in the flickering firelight bob seemed to
consist chiefly of a tall pair of angular
propped-up knees

  whiskers lit a crooked cigaret flicked a
spark out of his brushy white beard and
grinned a young puncher strange to the
country might have seen trouble ahead
but whiskers had ridden for the neighbor-
ing triangle r for ten years and knew ex-
actly which end of his rope the hondo was in

  belt may be a good cow hoss he con-
ceded aint sayin he aint but when
yuh cracks out that hes two jumps an a
long spit ahead of anything in the country
i guess yuh aint includin my hoss
brandy

  whiskers looked around at the twenty-
odd riders who lounged about the tiny fire
in the starlight he was a long way from
home old man rutherford owner of the
triangle r had decided to represent him-
self at the fall round-up of the j z and
whiskers was accompanying him but the
ancient cowboy knew that he was still
among friends

brandy he went on aint limited to
the brains o the man what taught him

namely me he picked up his own eddica-
tion where i left it off an carried it on his-
self to where its complete

 mebbe so bob crowe answered
but belt he was born a cut-horse teach-
in him the ways o the critters is just like
showin a gopher how to get hisself into a
hole

  lemme tell yuh somethin brandy
done said whiskers i had brandy
punch a wet cow out o the main herd an
over to the cuttin grounds but the cow
an calf had some way got pried loose one
from tother in the main herd anyways
when we gets to the cut the calf aint
there ridin back into the herd brandy
starts workin sudden without no sign from
me i sits quiet to find out whats his idee

well sir -if he aint smelled out that

lil bawlin calf an is cuttin her out to take
back to her maw

  that aint nothin heres a sample o
belts regular work said bob crowe
i rides into the main herd with belt an
picks a critter for the cut somethin is
funny about the way hes workin real
contrary not mindin what i say moren
half the time we gets to the edge o the
herd an i finds that belt has cut out the
critter i picked all right an two more
three to oncet an all three j zs

  there was a moments silence then-
first liar aint got no chance said a
voice in the background


o

adventure

  listen to what my horse spare-ribs
done spoke up heavy landor from
the sawbuck outfit

  he was a merry fat man not too tall with
a short child-like face and a perpetual
twinkle in his eye

  im ridin through the herd when i falls
off see i falls off o course right
there i has a chance to get trompled on
cause when i falls off i gets knocked in-
conscious

  more so than usual asked a voice
from the shadows

  yeah said heavy but not so much
as you so what does spare-ribs do but
turn around an pick me up by the seat
o the pants with his teeth an rush me
right out o the herd

  shut up heavy ordered whiskers
me an bob is tryin to do some serious

lyin now my hoss brandy once-

  shucks said bob crowe yuh see
that just goes to show that if a man aint
seen belt he aint seen a cow horse if i
mention the least little thing belt does its a
sign for all an sundry to break out with the
tallest lies they can think up

  probly whiskers admitted you was
real lucky to get belt cut to your string
but-

  string nothin bob crowe protested
belts my own horse what i won in a poker
game at hogjaw represented ten hun-
derd dollars in the pot belt did an
wasnt throwed in till his owner was cleaned
stripped down to a whistle an a brag
that explains it whiskers pointed out
any man has a right to pologize for the
hoss he atcherly owns

  you own brandy bob suggested
nope brandys just a ordinary hoss in
a string but hes had trainin

  you make me tired said bob crowe
frankly i suppose you aint got brandy
along o course not the best horse is
always the one thats somewheres else
but im sayin that if he was here why

id bet my socks an boots-

  brandys here said whiskers in
person

bob crowe considered for a long moment
we start cutting tomorrow he said
ill just put up belt against brandy in
the regular work leave anybody judge an
betcha fifty dollars

  whiskers grinned hate to take your
money bob taint right

  youre scairt

  a chuckle whispered among the lounging
punchers discreetly suppressed but evi-
dent whiskers eyes twinkled he shifted
from his elbow to a sitting position causing
his bald head to shine in the little flicker of
firelight

  yes said he well ill jest raise
yuh a hunderd

  then as bob crowe hesitated and bit
his sandy moustache hate to make yuh
ride all winter in the cold bob gets into
yore summers pay pretty heavy does it
nope i aint figurin to lose i was
jest wonderin how fer i could raise without
shovin yuh off the table

landor sos ill know whether to turn in

  i picks the old man whiskers said
kelleher asked bob in surprize
bein j z boss looks like he knows

  rutherford said whiskers guess
you forget that my old man is representin
the triangle r his own self at this j z

side of the fire i cant do it i got a
side bet up

  gosh was peters only comment

  i pick kelleher hisself said bob
who yuh want for third man

  heavy landor said whiskers him
an me was in a shootin scrape on two
opposite sides consekently hell gimme
square deal for fear it wont look right
heavy landor laughed merrily

  you sure dont hold a grudge much
  neither d you whiskers added

  im plumb amazed bob crowe stated
but it suits me

 kn whiskers always a handy
man when there was eating to
be done finished breakfast early
he had saddled brandy and was
already astride when bob crowe walked out
to the edge of the remuda by daylight
bob crowe was a lean horse-faced man
whose sense of humor was concealed by a
permanently sorrowful expression and a
dejected mustache

  after some moments bob crowe emerged
from the remuda leading an unprepossess-
ing-looking pony of a dusty dun color
about all that could be said for belts
build was that he was close-knit he was
stocky bumpy of knee and short of pastern

his neck was inclined to the ewe pattern
and he carried his head straight forward
on a dead level the only promise to be
found in his appearance was in a certain
brightness of eye which may mean several
things or nothing at all

  enthusiastic j z punchers whose eyes
ran from belt to brandy and back again
admitted that a comparison of looks left
belt looking pretty ratty brandy a big
brock-faced chestnut of rich bright color
stood arch-necked and alert he had bucked
a few rods at first mounting with whiskers
making fun of him the while and now
pawed and danced as the old cowboy tried
to hold him in one place

  brandy happened to be still for a few
moments as belt was led out and during
those moments whiskers sat like a statue
staring at bob crowes horse then he
silently wheeled brandy and riding to
where old man rutherford was saddling
he dismounted and walked close to the boss
of the triangle r

  big boy he said did you put a bet
on brandy

  i sure did said the old man

  was it much

  rutherford grinned and spat

  much you know that spring we call
the lobo hole where i want to build a
camp

  the one you an hack berringer is
figgerin to lawsuit about

yep hack berringer claims it for his
sawbuck outfit i say its mine well
sir i just bet hack berringer all rights on
the lobo hole on your horse thats all
whiskers looked sick

  you seen bobs belt hoss

  nope

  take a look

  rutherford looked a good long look
then the men looked at each other

  whatll we do asked whiskers

  do aint nothin to do we bet
didnt we

  rutherford shrugged

    cept you get in there an ride cowboy
you ride an well beat him yet brandys
no slouch hisself whiskers

  all an sundry know that he aint
said whiskers turning away

  yuh look scairt whiskers sung out a
grinning cowboy as he cinched

  mighty fine lookin hoss that belt
said whiskers guess ill have to sit in


adventure

the saddle after all course i was jest
goin to send brandy into the herd by
hisself

  better had whiskers youre gettin
too old to be climbin on horses

  yep pretty old whiskers agreed good-
naturedly wouldnt blieve to look at
me that ill be only ninety-seven come
christmas now would yuh

  rutherford walked over to joe kelleher
boss of the j z

  joey he said was this bet the boys
made put in writin

  sure was ben no argyments for me
not while im in the embarrassin position
o judge

  leave me see

  joe kelleher unbuttoned the pocket of
a tawny shirt that had once been orange
and dug out a crumpled piece of paper
torn from the back of the tally book he
handed it to rutherford

  this odd document when deciphered read
as follows

to whom it may concern

   i bets that a horse eddicated by me can beat any
cowhorse eddicated elsewhere in all round work
speed on the straightaway barred or anyways
that bob crowe can not prove different this round
up

  g halford beck namely whiskers

   i bets that such is not by no means the case

  robt crowe

  p s we both agree that what the judges says
goes without argument

  it sure took a pile o hagglin to perduce
that same said joe kelleher look all
right to you

  yep old man rutherford ran a big
hand over his craggy face and gazed for a
moment at the irregular horizon well
he concluded as he turned away well
see what timell deal out

some hours later joe kelleher
sat his horse somewhat apart
from the herd watching oper-
ations with a clouded brow
beneath a blazing cloudless sky a vast
puddle of cattle milled with a ceaseless
revolving shuffling movement held in by
the circle riders repeatedly a lone critter
bellowing with wrath and hurt feelings
bolted out of the herd hazed by a close-
ridden horse tried to head back and was
finally delivered at one of the smaller pud-
dles that were the cuts

  when chance arose joe kelleher called
heavy landor and wad peters to him
what time is it heavy

  heavy drew out a nickel-plated watch
five minutes of

  of what

  the hefty puncher shot a calculating
glance at the sun

  well i shd say eleven

  but what does the watch say de-
manded kelleher

  it dont hour hand busted off two
years back tells how close it is but dont
say to what

  well t any rate its gettin on toward
noon bob an whiskers will straddle
fresh horses an fore then weve got to fig-
ure out who wins this-fool cow horse

contest an right now i want to say i
wisht i was in no way connected with it

  gosh remarked wad peters contem-
platively

  powerful lot o bettin mongst the boys
my own cook has let out moren six hun-
dred dollars in bettin on brandy he bein
contrary an always likin to run down the
outfit hes with guess he must o win a
crap game before he come here near all

what used to be a faro dealer oh your
j z rannies found some takers mister
kelleher

  theres goin to be a heap o argyment
if our decision is the least bit over-ripe
said kelleher which do yuh like

  the punchers looked blank

  which has cut out the most cows
asked heavy

  kelleher shook his head

  that dont signify seems like bob is
a few ahead but whiskers has been han-
dlin some terrible snaky stock one of
em was the king of the rattlesnakes for
sure all the boys stopped work to watch
an holler

  dont think belt hasnt been doin
some pretty work nuther said wad
peters i never in my life see two such
ponies in one remuda belt goes at it like
each critter was his last chance at somethin
top horse from hog jaw 



to eat look now boy didja see him
take a steak off that blue steer with his
teeth

  brandy aint exactly nailed to one
place heavy offered he can step
around some too puts me in mind of a
spider on a stove

  beautiful horse brandy said kelleher
a real pitcher

  didja notice bob holdin his hands over

his head on that last one - if that

horse needs a bridle a-tall

  shucks whiskers has had his reins
tied to the horn for a hour those boys
start em with their legs an the horse does
the rest

  that brandy has a powerful lot of
bottom said heavy dancin all the
way

an belt is just one chunk o tough
leather an gamer than a buck flea on wash
day said kelleher boys im worried
i cant offer no decision mebbe we
should call it a draw said wad peters

  leave me an mr kelleher get about
four miles start-then you announce it
said heavy landor pityingly ill take
a chance with one faction against me but
there aint no percentage in havin em all
land on yuh at once

  i spose if worse comes to more so we
can make em ride again this afternoon
said kelleher though taint hardly
right

  whiskers would quit cold fore hed
risk spoilin that chestnut wad peters
opined

  i got it yelped heavy i sees a way
whereby well get out o this alive an
happy 

  for --s sake how demanded kel-
leher

  take both boys into the middle o the
herd post a rider at north an south for
markers then make em each try for the
same steer one to cut him to the east the
other to the west

  bust me for a wool-duster said kelle-
her if i dont think he has it

  one side o the herd may be closer set
objected peters an whos to say which
is the middle

  leave bob post the markers an pick the
middle said heavy then give whiskers
choice o sides

  i guess that does it wad peters ad-
mitted

  boy you got a head that would crack
an ax declared kelleher an im for yub

you agreeable wad

   let er rip

       bob crowe welcomed the idea
       with enthusiasm and whiskers
       though looking a little dubious
       agreed to make the test

  riders to act as markers were posted to
the north and south of the herd it was
agreed that fifty yards outside of the near-
est three cattle at the edge of the herd
would be the point at which the critter
would be considered cut within that
distance the losing rider might still attempt
to turn the animal back in case of doubt
as to which side the contested animal was
brought out on the direction in which
the animal passed beyond the markers was
to decide

  kelleher rode into the herd with bob and
whiskers and the former picked the center

  that red steer said he

  ill cut to the west said whiskers
instantly

  kelleher rode between them until he
could touch their shoulders with his out-
spread arms then take im away
and the ponies leaped to their work

  the judges had anticipated a careful
play of skill and luck probably lasting
many minutes to kellehers bewilder-
ment the contest was over almost before
it was begun

  two ponies descended upon the aston-
ished red steer like twin whirlwinds a snap-
ping rope end made the hair fly on his rump
and he dodged bellowing into the thick of
the herd

  twisting and turning among scrambling
mixed stock the steer and his hazers bolted
south through the cattle a temporary
advantage in the shifting of the cattle put
bob and belt a little in the lead and the
steer bent to the east

  whiskers and brandy were clear again

  now boy yelled whiskers

  suddenly brandy stopped short so un-
expectedly that whiskers bent almost
double over the horses withers at that
moment a squalling calf plunged distracted-
ly in front of belt and horse and rider went
down belt was up almost instantly
with bob in the saddle but they were out
of it then-

  astonished punchers heard whiskers yell


adventure

at his horse saw him snatch at the reins
which he had disdained to untie from
the horn brandy had perceived a momen-
tary opening in the herd flashed around
the hindquarters of the fleeing steer to the
opposite side and turned the animal not
west but east

  whiskers spurred brandy forward en-
deavoring to make the turn complete thus
heading the steer to the west the red
critter dodged and cattle surged in between
the contested animal had neared the east
border of the herd belt was shouldering
his way twisting and turning through the
cattle the steer tried to turn back but
belt seemed to be on both sides of him at
once

  then belt stretched out a lean straining
neck and punished the steers rump with a
shearing snap the next moment that
steer was out of the herd out of the herd
unmistakably to the east

  whiskers rode slowly into the open and
toward the remuda

   taint yore fault he muttered i
taught yuh that to work with the other
hoss an not agin him

  a long rumble of indecent expressions
peculiarly original and vivid smoked their
way out of whiskers beard

the cooks horn had blown a
dozen laughing jubilant punch-
ers and a few dejected ones
had unsaddled and were drawing
their chuck whiskers sat well off to one
side staring at the crowd without seeing
it apparently in deep thought no one
ragged him

  wait now protested blackie bender
to the six or seven punchers who clamored
about him for their winnings wait up
judges decision aint come in yet no i
dont care how you seen it billy m boy
eyes now sought the three judges and
found them in conference with old man
rutherford three rods away the old
man of the triangle r was arguing a point
quietly but intensely and heavy landor
at least was beginning to look alarmed

  here now yelled hack berringer
influencin the judges dont go you
leave the arguin to them rutherford
at this interruption the three men and
rutherford still talking in undertones
began to stroll toward the main group
the eyes of the judges thoughtfully studied

the ground their hands sought pockets
heavy landor asked a question and joe
kelleher pulled out the crumpled paper
from his shirt pocket and showed it to him
heavy nodded ruefully

  well said the boss of the j z aloud
we may as well have it over with now
he took back the paper from heavy and
strode forward

  the cook stopped dishing out grub all
waited some standing near the cook
others seated cross-legged a little apart
pans of chuck in their laps

  boys said kelleher i guess most of
yuh know me i guess youll all admit that
i stand for square deals an in the first
place i dont want no rowin nor bother

in no shape over this decision a -

peculiar thing has come up that no one in
no way looked for whiskers and mr
rutherford too says that if theyd had any
idea of it they wouldnt in no case have left
this contest go on an i personally knows
both o them to be square

  not a puncher moved both factions
stared in noncommital suspense

  speakin for the judges we cant do this
or dont want to unless both contestants
is willin but in case both contestants is
agreeable were ready an willin to call
this no contest or a draw

  speakin for whiskers rutherford
spoke up instantly hes agreeable

  well i aint bob crowe flashed

an i think thats a-of a way to do

things if that was a draw im a indian
a scattering rumble of support came from
the punchers who had put their money ou
belt

  everybody notice anyway what whisk-
ers an me offered to do growled ruther-
ford yuh asked for it now yuh get it
go on joey

  the bet reads like this said kelleher
holding up the wrinkled sheet from the
tally book signed by both contestants
he read slowly

  to whom it may concern i bets that
a horse eddicated by me can beat any
horse eddicated elsewhere in all round
work speed on the straightaway barred
or anyways that bob crowe can not prove
different this round-up signed g hal-
ford beck namely whiskers i bets that
such aint the case robert crowe

  well i done it with belt said bob
  accordin to the way this bet reads
top horse from hog jaw



said kelleher weightily the decision goes
to whiskers

  there was a moment of open-mouthed
silence then kelleher hurried on

  rutherford i know dont lie he says
belt was bred an born on the triangle
r range out of a mare o his named silver
he sold the foal to whiskers who named
him bullet an broke him trained him and
rode him for six years up until last winter
when he lost him in a poker game at hog-
jaw which same game was the reason
whiskers did winter ridin last winter for
the first time in twenty years

  therefore whiskers wins both horses
bein eddicated by him in the first place
another long moment of silence then
pandemonium broke loose a dozen ar-
guments were going at once blackie
benders right hand snatched at his gun
two old hands dropped to their hands
and knees to be out of the line of fire
just as heavy landor grabbed blackies
arm from behind a general brawl looked
to be the order of the day

  shut up bellowed kelleher firing his
forty-five into the ground ill kill the

- that opens his trap you charley

hank smoky

  again a silence a most desirable one
prevailed

  this will be reasoned out by the con-
testants and the judges continued ruther-
ford an all bets will go as they decide
now what yuh got to say bob

  i say all bets are off but mine said
bob i stick otherwise no contest
whiskers accepts that said rutherford
anybody else that wants to carry on
their bets can make special arrangements
between theirselves but all previous bets
is off accordin to me

  that goes with the judges said kel-
leher an the man that gets insultin
about this has got me on his neck to start
with

  as for me bob went on i dont
back down on my bets with no man
all i asks for is proof i bragged an
ill back my brags but i think in a
case like this it aint right to ask any
man just to go on somebodys say so
without no other proof no matter who
the feller is

  i check that said hack berringer
i never welched on a fair bet yet the
judges final decision holds with me but
i gotta see proof

  then our bet stands asked rutherford

  yep i asks no odds anywhere said
hack

  that fair from whiskers lookout
joe kelleher asked old man rutherford

  check said rutherford

  well looks like your move ben joe
said

  rutherford scratched his head several
times he opened his mouth and shut it
again his eyes swept the distance con-
templatively then suddenly they came
to rest on something behind the others
and he grinned

  look yonder he said theres all
the proof yuh should want

  they looked and witnessed a rare
phenomenon of the range a little dis-
tance apart sat whiskers hands locked
about his knees hat down over his
eyes head bowed in thought a horse
strayed from the remuda was coming
up behind him with nose outstretched
as they watched the horse softly
nudged whiskers neck with his nose
it was belt

for stern devotion to duty and punishing
weakness

  standing on the poop parrot had been
casually calling some man on the main
royal yard a spineless son of a barnacle-
which was his limit of bad language-when
he had chanced to observe one of those gen-

erally kindly preachers who conduct bethels
for sailors on the dock-side thus on this
blustery afternoon hard casepol had in-
vited that one into his cabin the main
result at first was the purchase of a case
containing three dozen bibles and the
captains promise to do what he could to
spread the word the promise worried
him because he kept his promises and he
could see no possible way of keeping this
one the possession of the bibles worried
him still more because of the intimate
superstitions aforementioned for captain
parrot knew only too well that the bible
was a great book but not a book for the
profane or the ignorant

  he was not profane himself but all his
acquaintances were and his next crew would
be just as bad as the last the ancient
marine belief held that the bible must not
be touched by evil hands that if anything
were laid upon the bible or if a leaf of it
were torn the person responsible would be
damned eternally this may have been
the reason why one never found a bible in
the forecastle of one of those old-time sail-
ing ships or in the cabin either

  so captain parrot worked his ship out
of the bristol channel his mind disturbed
by the preachers advice to tone down his
superstitions and his imagination trying to
puzzle out how he could ever do it while


the mutiny



his promise to that excellent man now
seemed like a good-natured lie and pol
never told a lie lying being weakness

  the presence of all those bibles on board
was an added source of worriment the
captain had never heard of a ship going to
sea with bibles on board and here he was
with thirty-six of them if the crew had
been religious it would have been different
but thirty-six bibles aboard a ship with a
crew still mostly drunk who were being
chased around by a mate and second mate
whose language was simply terrible-why
surely this would mean bad luck and a long
passage the old superstition would not

die	it would be useless to tell the mates to
quit profanity in the first place the habit
was too well established-they could not
quit and in the second mates who had had
the habit so long could not be expected to
get the limit of work out of sailors unless
they swore at them and captain parrot
recognized it as his duty to his owners to
get all the work out of the men that was
possible that was what they were paid
for

  so long before they passed lundy hard
case pol was facing one of the most difficult
problems of his life his disposal of the
bibles too was a matter of which he felt
ashamed the case was not marked and
to the questioning steward parrot had said
oh put it down in the lazarette with the
other stores feeling when he said it hor-
ribly like one who hides her head under the
bedclothes to escape the lightning

  the weather was fine and the wind fair
but such was hard case pols distress that
he would almost have welcomed bad
weather because a head wind and a gale
would have given him something else to
think about

  a week passed the weather still fine and
the wind still fair if it had not been for
his promise to the kindly preacher parrot
might have forgotten the bibles for
either the old superstition was wrong or else
-surely it could not be possible that he
had a religious crew aboard a moments
consideration convinced him otherwise

  then the blow fell the steward sorting
stores dropped the case and discovered its
contents he had been well brought up
had that steward and was naturally offend-
ed to find thirty-six bibles all mixed up
with peas for soup pantiles for bread and
ancient horses destined for the harness

cask so he carried them up to the captains
cabin

  i thought the lazarette was no nice place
for bibles sir he explained virtuously

  no more it is steward

  hard case pol suddenly saw a wonderful
way of redeeming his promise to the bethel
minister as well as of asserting his domi-
nance in a new and delightful manner and
the scheme that came to him also provided
a safe course for avoiding the danger of sail-
ing too closely to the bible superstition

  leave them here steward ill attend
to it

the steward left the cabin and
the captain well pleased with
himself contemplated the further
beauties of his plan yes he
would avoid getting caught aback on the
bibles while still keeping his promise it
would never do to indiscriminately issue
bibles to such a crew as inhabited the fore-
castle of the kenyon neither would it be
safe to supply the mates carpenter sail-
maker cook or steward with them for
sooner or later some careless marlin-spike
of a fingered ruffian would tear a leaf or
something

  the inevitable bad luck would ensue and
then some poor innocent wretch would be
blamed a regular witch hunt would take
place for the jonah with the wrong man
suffering had parrot not seen a man al-
most keel-hauled because he was suspected
of being a jonah he had just like the
superstition of witchcraft he would avoid
such trouble trouble interfered with the
work captain parrot would read the
bible to the men himself every sunday be-
tween noon and one oclock this would do
the men good and no work would be inter-
fered with since it would be the watch below
of one watch and on sunday afternoon only
needed work was done anyway but first
being thorough he would study the bible
himself

  at once he began to apply his mind to ab-
sorbing the old testament and since by
sheer force of character he had made his
own life and moulded the fives of others the
ideas he gained were tinged largely by his
reactions to what he read he read with
care he found parts which entranced
him and he had not gone very far maybe
skipping a chapter occasionally before he
found himself becoming a hero-worshipper


adventure

for the first time in his life and enjoying the
sensation

   moses that gallant old fighter for liberty
was the hero parrot simply idolized the
leader of the children of israel particu-
larly did he enjoy the part moses played in
regard to pharo those plagues of egypt
and what a first mate moses would have
made hard case pol positively smacked
his lips when he thought of this he had
good enough mates as mates went but
fancy having a man like moses a picture
of moses chasing the crew of the kenyon
around the deck always holding over them
the possibility of one of the plagues en-
tranced captain parrot

  he spent some of the happiest moments
of his life contemplating the effect of this
uncomfortable threat on some of his men
all of them in fact for like all old captains
parrot firmly believed that to allow sailors
to be comfortable was to ruin them yes
a man like moses even one who was not a
perfect likeness would have been worth
double wages and hard case pol did not
believe in high wages the more wages
paid the more whisky drunk was his idea
money was therefore wasted on sailors
but a mate like moses

  so the captain told the mate to rig church
next sunday he spoke as evenly and
naturally as if he had been giving an ordi-
nary order showing nothing of the effort it
cost to be natural for sincere as parrot
was it was not easy to teu such a man to
prepare a church the mate struggling
between surprise and horror could only
gasp

  church sir

  yes mister

  where asked the stunned mate

  on the poop where did you think
said pol acidly

  the mate grinned with much lack of tact

  wheres the psalm-slinger sir he
queried

  mister marshall replied parrot severe-
ly holding his temper because of what he
was going to say and his belief that religious
teachers always kept their feelings under
control mister marshall ill thank you
not to use either vulgar or disreverent re-
marks about preachers of the gospel
dont call them any sort of slingers as to
your question i will lead the service you
get the church rigged

  very well sir

  and the mate went away feeling anaes-
thetized

  now no mate curries favor with his men
he it is who must bear the mens ill feeling
and be prepared to hit hard if the ill-feeling
becomes too apparent even when he knows
the men are blaming him for some needless
driving work which the captain has origi-
nated nevertheless this excellent mister
marshall went away contemplating break-
ing the awful news with some gentleness via
the carpenter-sailmaker route and he also
thought of letting it be known that he
marshall was not responsible for the ex-
traordinary order

  but before it came to him that no man
would ever suspect him of religious endeav-
our his sense of discipline and duty ban-
ished the weak notion the order would be
given naturally as parrot had given it
besides if he let the men know how he felt
they might become contrary and imagine
that they possessed souls or something that
needed saving whereas mister marshall
knew quite well that they didnt

  then further thinking led him not to
anticipate trouble but joy-much joy
when the unhappy sailors were ushered into
church and compelled to listen to their
captains teaching for pol was distinctly
an amateur at this sort of thing

  marshall visioned the faces the entire
scene with delight because they would
not know what was going to happen they
would rig church feeling bewildered no
doubt but not one of them would know
what was being done none of them knew
what the inside of a church looked like
neither did the second mate and least of all
him no what the mates intended and
elaborate preparations portended would be
a mystery to the men who would do the
preparing under his orders the captain
had just told him to rig church given him a
free hand that his own ideas regarding
the inside of a church were entirely theo-
retical mattered not marshall would rig
church as he considered churches should be
rigged the men would never guess what
was going on

it was a fine sunday with the
kenyon doing nicely close-hauled
on the starboard tack the sea
was a confused delight of agitated
diamonds under a sun which was a spirit
of radiance during the forenoon watch
the mutiny



mister marshall proceeded with his ecclesi-
astical preparations parrot never inter-
fered with an officer when the officer was
doing his best unless the safety of the ship
demanded interference but there were mo-
ments during that church rigging when he
was called upon to exercise some restraint
for the mate was doing his work lavishly
even rising in architectural moments to
what he called a pulpit the while loudly
chasing his puzzled watch

  but when pol took the sun at noon his
restraint broke down he was not accus-
tomed to taking a meridian altitude from
the interior of a church parrot fussed
with his sextant trying to get the best side
of the ship for the observation but it was
too much of a sort of obstacle race he
boiled then called

  mister marshall what does all this
mean

  you told me to rig church sir answered
the mate with fine innocence

  mister marshall i am not calling you
names but please remember that the person
who even in fun mocks religion is not wise
but very much the reverse unrig the
church ive been thinking it over you
take away all the gear you have put on the
poop and just leave a camp stool for me near
the wheel the rest can stand it aint
right anyhow for the men to sit in the
presence of their captain

  and captain parrot walked away leaving
the mate strangely ashamed of his fooling
parrots sincerity might have crude mo-
ments but it was soul-touching

  forgetting hunger in expectancy the crew
gathered pol cowed them with a look
forgetting that ministers do not open the
service with hardcase manifestations the
mate had annoyed him but he was not
nervous

  settling himself the captain glanced up
at the leach of the main royal as the
kenyon was sailing by the wind it was the
duty of the man at the wheel to keep the
leach lifting as this was duly taking place
parrot opened the bible

  men i am going to read a chapter to
you most of you know what the bible is
but for those that dont ill say its the
greatest book on earth all religions are
built on it just as all ships are built on keels
now listen because i dont want to have to
get angry with any of you ill read about
one of the greatest men that ever lived

his name was moses and i hope it will
do you good because i aint in the habit of
wasting my time trying to do good to the
likes of you

  he paused and the men who had been in
theaters if not in churches trying to do
what they believed to be the correct thing
in spite of their feelings began to applaud
again parrot cowed them and then he
plunged with gusto into the plagues of
egypt

  naturally and dutifully the man at the
wheel was interested besides like the
majority of the congregation he had some
trouble in preventing his face from express-
ing his feelings and as he dreaded the result
of giving vent to them his steering became
somewhat erratic

  and moses said unto pharo-

  the captain looked up at the main
royal instead of the leach shaking the
sail was ramping full he swallowed hard
but realizing that it would never do to
speak his mind in the middle of the plagues
he went on reading but the old adam was
giving him more trouble than even pharo
gave moses

  and moses said to pharo-

  again he looked aloft the sail was away
full parrot the captain began to get the
better of parrot the teacher like gobbo
he fought manfully with the devil inside
but-

  and moses said to pharo- luff you
blistered son of a jelly-fish luff-youre
two points off the wind

now when the mutiny took
placs and the colored cook-who
really belonged to the afterguard
and was therefore a traitor-
came aft as the herald of the mutineers par-
rot was sitting in his cabin cogitating over
his ill-success as a teacher his efforts did
not seem to have met with the result they de-
served there was just as much bad lan-
guage for instance as there had been be-
fore he was muttering

  ill make this crew religious if i have to
ropes-end the lot of them

  prior to the ambassadorial effort of the
cook the men had talked a great deal seek-
ing a more or less valid excuse for bearding
the captain their simple souls had no
objection to religion as religion only to the
captains teaching it to them but as they
did not like to take the risk of telling him


adventure

this directly and in ordinary language
and they struggled to find a befitting
excuse

  they found many excuses for protest but
not one which they felt would have any
chance of success all the things they
could invent seemed only to point to blister-
ing answers harder work fewer watches
below in the afternoons and such like
unpleasantness but they continued to
seek

  it was one peters a gentleman of un-
known nationality but probably of several
it was peters who was inspired to become
the forecastle moses who would endeavor to
lead his mates away from the bondage of
pharo parrot

  i got it he announced in the midst of a
blue meeting which had become mute i
got it

  got wot queried a skeptical and
cynical cockney

  religious liberty guaranteed by every
constitution on earth said peters ecstati-
cally

  liberty constitutions growled the
cockney a fat lot old pol cares abart
liberty or constitutions least of all ours
wot with is workin us up an all a fat lot
old pol cares abart constitutions when were
a thousand miles from land

  well tell him in a round robin pur-
sued peters

  wots the good of that said the cock-
ney even if you can write youve got to
say somethink avent you which is wot
weve been trying to do better swaller is
bible readins taint doing us much
arm

  anyway ill write it said peters if
so being the rest of you is willing to sign
along of me them that can not sign can
make their marks ill just ask him to cut
out his teaching on sundays make it look
like as if we was going to teach ourselves
like save him the trouble and thank him
for his kindness

  the cockney spat silently but expres-
sively

  will you all put your names around the
robin asked peters

  it wont be a robin if we dont thats
forecastle law said the cockney

  you go ahead and write it if you can find
paper and pencil

  but aint it mutiny asked one timid
soul

  the cockney laughed

  mutiny course not mr peters ere
dont deal in mutinies e writes round
robins and calls em religious wars

  but peters was not to be deterred by
scoffers the timid would sign or make
their marks when he commanded few
of them could read anyhow this thought
impressed him with the need of careful calig-
raphy it would never do to send aft a
robin which the captain would not be able
to read

  dont ask me to take yer robin aft
remarked the cockney

  i wont peters looked up and saw the
cook who was not supposed to be familiar
with the sailors listening with much inter-
est i wont ask you ill get the most
intelligent man i can find to do it youd
make a mess of it

  wholl you get the cockney grinned

  oh cook-cook could you oblige me
with some writin paper most of us here
aint got the education to have such
things

  peters beamed and the cook fell the
cockney hid his delighted face but the othei
men looked on with astonishment

  but the agreeable and smiling cook lacked
writing paper he would never have ad-
mitted this before the men after what
peters had said and he pretended carefully
to search his bag but he did not fool the
astute peters

  oh used it all exclaimed that marine
machiavelli all you handsome chaps
writes so many letters to girls neve- mind
maybe you can find some other sort of paper
that will do what the likes of us writes on
dont matter much

  the flattered cook owned a pair of lurid
socks as yet virgin around these was
wrapped some paper with some hesita-
tion-but whether he hesitated on account
of the socks or on account of the feelings of
peters is not known-he then offered the
wrapping paper

  fine said peters with gallant hearti-
ness yet secretly troubled lest the captain
eventually discovering the author of the
round robin might suspect him of lack of
taste or even sheer ignorance of the correct
thing in writing papers

  many great men have never mastered
spelling and peters was one of these

  old pol will know what we mean he
said hopefully as he labored
the mutiny



  lets ope so-or not as the case may
be said the cynical cockney

  as peters warmed to his task some dim
memory of the early protestant heroes
cheered him his history was somewhat
mixed and so he debited the persecutions of
the reformers to nero by this time he was
thinking of lions and howling roman mobs
he paused he had no desire to be a
martyr and began to feel unhappy he

was between the-of his jeering mates if

he did not go on with his task and the deep
sea of the wrath of captain parrot if
he did

  but the fact of the impossibihty of ascrib-
ing a round robin to any particular indi-
vidual because of its circle of signatures
relieved his fears he possessed no dis-
tinctive style of caligraphy and parrot
would not have known it if he had but he
took much care to disguise his writing

  it aint like we was refusing to do ship
work or anything he said as he finished
and were not refusing to be religious
only asking for freedom to be religious our
own way he cant get mad about that
can he

  well you wrote it said the cockney
ungratefully

  but you all put your names to it par-
ried the scribe and he wont know who
began it

  lets ope not the cockney was en-
joying himself of course you dont
know old pol because this is your first voy-
age with him but i do this is my
fourth voyage along of him each time the
bleedin boardin ousekeeper promised to
get me an easy ship wiv a gentleman for a
captain and each time i woke up in my
bunk with the ship at sea and hard case
pol captain of her lets ope e wont
catch on to who sterted this ere robin
you dont know im like wot i do or youd
never ave done it

peters seemed distressed but
it was too late to draw back be-
cause the cook entranced by the
the magic flattery of peters into a
joyful irresponsibility and complete forget-
fulness of his traitorous position had gone
aft with the round robin had some one
mentioned just whispered to him that in
war times-and he had heard the cockney
call this a religious war-had some kind
spirit told him that traitors were shot in

times of war and explained that he the
cook was a traitor he would have jumped
over the side rather than have gone aft
with such a dignified manner stiffening his
greasy dungarees but there was no one
to warn him or even suggest that as one of
the afterguard his position as ambassador
of mutineers was dubious he smiled quite
happily and naturally when he asked the
second mate if he could speak to the cap-
tain that captain who even then was con-
sidering spreading religion with the end of
a rope

  and sitting on the fore hatch the cock-
ney was saying consolingly to a worried
peters

  of course you aint scared but thats
because you dont know old pol and his lit-
tle ways like wot i do

  better wait awhile cook said the
second mate good naturedly the old
old man seems sore about something
but mister wilson sir i must see
him	

  and the cook with vast importance
showed the neatly folded paper

  what have you got there demanded
the second mate becoming interested

  i cant tell you sir its-its private-
for the old man

  the second mate was human and curious
there was but one thing to do if he were to
satisfy his curiosity he walked down the
poop ladder

  you wait here cook he said at the
cabin door ill let you know if the cap-
tain will see you

  so the cook waited while the second
mate went in trying to smooth the grin
from his face set there by his speculations
concerning the matter about which the cook
would write letters to the captain and the
manner of the captain when he received
the letter he had never heard of cooks
writing letters to captains never before
therefore this was a sort of experiment of
the cooks and pol was not the sort of
man upon whom to try experiments not
particularly not the experiments of cooks
writing to the captain as if they were
equals the interest of the second mate in-
creased but his curiosity concerning the
letter was dimmed by his curiosity concern-
ing what the captain would do to the writer
of it for of course the second mate had
no reasons for supposing that any one but
the cook was the writer


adventure

  the cook wants to see you sir hes
acting mail-man to his own mail

  what-what are you talking about
mister snapped the captain who was in
no mood for jests

  the cook is aft sir and he has a letter
hes written to you which he wants to de-
liver

  the captain stared then he sniffed
no the second mate was sober was it
the sun then

  mister wilson do you mean to stand
there and tell me that the cook has written
a letter to me to me and that he is aft
here wanting to deliver it

  thats what he says sir replied the
second mate cheerfully

  the captain gasped then he became
himself again

  bring him in mister and when hes in
the cabin do you shut the door so he cant
get out till ive finished with him and
put your back against it write letters to
me will he even if he has gone crazy its
no excuse

  the second mate walked along the alley-
way feeling in better health than at any
other time since his last girl had jilted him
and beckoned the cook that ones dark
face showed less hilarity more interest in
the deeper values of life as it were and
possibly of death some dim echo of jungle
instinct had scented danger and while the
consciousness of the ambassador had not as
yet translated the feeling of fear into either
thought or action its presence was sufficient
to chill given a half hour longer to wait
he might have realized that it were better
that he retired to his galley with the missive
undelivered

  come in cook said the second mate in
strangely gentle tones

  yes suh

  the cook advanced hesitating as that
most impolite of men the second mate
politely stood aside to allow him the cook
precedence along the alleyway to the wait-
ing captain

  the captains waiting cook

  and the cook hesitated no longer that
foolish self-importance which has ruined
so many of us held him in its tentacles
he ceased to wonder at the politeness
of the second mate he had no business
with such low persons as second mates
was not the captain himself waiting for
him

  yes cook what is it

  hard case pol spoke as gently as the
second mate had spoken which in itself was
a danger signal but his eyes directed
upon that round robin which he supposed to
be a letter from the cook to himself showed
no gentleness neither mercy they glowed
with a fire which seemed to have been
especially kindled to incinerate cooks and
the unfortunate african while not entirely
appreciating the enormity of his crime
crumpled under that heat something was
wrong just what it was did not matter
half so much as did the prospect of escape
the trapped cook turned in terror to the
door it was closed and the unusually
broad shoulders of the erstwhile gentle
second mate were stretched across it

  yes cook what is it

  there was less gentleness in the voice of
captain parrot

  suh-oh jus nothing jus nothing
the cook wailed

  so you come aft here taking up my
time and the time of the second mate for
nothing eh what do you mean by that
rasped pol

the cook could not face that glare in
desperation he turned with pity pleading
from his eyes to the second mate the
second mate apparently saw him not
what have you got in your hand

  the captain was getting to the heart of
the matter

  oh sir just nothing just nothing sir
captain parrot sir

  you lie like a horse give me that
letter

  it aint no letter captain sir no
letter sir

  give it to me and keep your mouth
shut

it is probable that this com-
mand robbed parrot of an inter-
esting explanation of the letter
which he seized from the trem-
bling hand although that command was not
literally obeyed its meaning however
was for the cook said nothing he was
far too scared but his mouth remained
open at a most acute angle

  captain parrot unfolded the missive and
gazed at it while the deeply interested sec-
ond mate who could not leave the door
suffered from curiosity in a silence as deep
as the cooks
the mutiny-



  the captains gaze concentrated upon
something like this

      tsthe-vev

  words are impotent and captain par-
ot said nothing the silence became hor-
rible it was broken by the frantic babble
of the cook who was collapsing under the
frown of that spinx-like face staring at the
letter

shut up come here mister wilson

  the second mate obeyed with alacrity
but as the captain had rolled the round
robin into a hard ball he was bereft
of the pleasure of reading it he felt
hurt

  mister wilson i think you are the
strongest man on the ship let me see you
grip this fool and force his mouth open i
am going to see that he eats every bit of this
fool paper

  to describe what followed would be as
painful as reading that awful book sur-
gical operations prior to anesthesia a
graphic description of the horrors of the tor-
ture chamber of the tower of london would
be mild by comparison let us not even
inflict reflected misery upon an already
suffering world let it suffice the cook ate
every scrap of that round robin but what
he thought of the captain who gave the
order and what he thought of the strength
of the fingers of the second mate are sub-
jects best avoided we do not use that
kind of language

go forward cook the captain spoke

with no gentleness if there was any one
to do the cooking besides you id throw
you over the side and dont mix with the
men again they have made a bigger fool
of you than your parents did mister wil-
son call all hands aft i want to talk to
them

   lay aft all hands

  the voice of the second mate roared along
the deck and certain of thosewho had signed
the round robin trembled while the chief
conspirator felt distinctly unhappy the
least any of them expected was captain
parrot standing on the break of the poop
and taking shots at them with his revolver
instead of this he began to talk like a father
who has only the kindest interest in the
welfare of his children but this parental
attitude of voice did not last

  like a lot of children he leaned over
the rail before the mizzen mast like a
lot of boys you send that idiot of a cook aft
with what you call a round robin now
why didnt you come aft like men and tell
me what was the trouble eh have i
ever refused to talk to you you benighted
sons of ignorant heathens so you want
liberty to go your own way in religion do
you well where do you think your way
of religious liberty will take you there
is only one place and thats a whole lot hot-
ter than the equator but im going to do
the best i can for you you may sail your
own religious course but i am going to
supply the charts steward

  the quiet but crescendo voice rose to a
sudden howl and the steward appeared
precipitately

  bring those bibles out of my cabin
steward

   very good sir

  at the word bibles a wave seemed to go
over the assembled crew while the second
mate gazed at the horizon as if he saw a
distant ship every man of them had
known the superstition concerning bibles
since he had first gone to sea and there were
those who had been at sea for nearly half a
century the bibles arrived

  is there any reading matter in the fore-
castle demanded hard case pol have
you any books there how many of you
can read anyhow those that can read
hold up their right hands

three hands were held aloft one started
to go up but the owner of it did not seem
certain that what he knew about reading


adventure

was enough to entitle him to be called a
reader so he put it down again

  the captain looked very grave

  go forrard two of you and bring aft
all the books papers and reading matter
there is in the forecastle

  the men went aft and when they came
aft again bearing the small pitiful reading
matter of windjammers of that date the
gravity of the captain increased piece by
piece he examined that reading matter and
piece by piece he handed it back to a
trembling sailor after examination

  his features set in awful doom like a
judge about to pronounce sentence of exe-
cution the second mate ceased to be in-
terested in the remote horizon and ap-
proached quietly but parrot who never
reprimanded an officer before the men
said-

  go and see how shes heading mister
in a tone which clearly meant that the liter-
ature he was examining was no stuff for the
eyes of a decent second mate

  so for the second time that day the second
mate was bitterly disappointed as a matter
of fact the reading matter was as harmless
as skimmed milk

  so said parrot in a terrible voice so
you that reads such muck as this asks for
liberty to learn religion your own way do
you its a good thing that i take more in-
terest in my men than some captains do

  the men doubted the goodness but said
nothing

  then parrot turned upon the men holding
the reading matter and fairly shouted-

  throw that stuff overboard

  oliver cromwell could not have done it
better or could not have been obeyed more
rapidly

  it was said of captain parrot that he
could stand aft at the wheel and make him-
self heard by a man on the end of the jib-
boom if his ship was heading into a hurri-
cane always provided of course that a
man could exist on the end of the jibboom
during a hurricane it was with the same
sort of roar that he would have been re-
quired to use under those interesting con-
ditions that he now shouted

  how many of you has bibles

  not a man admitted having a bible

  i thought so the voice striving to
express sorrow could have been heard by
normal ears half a mile away i thought
so you low unchristian heathens acute

  pain pulsed in his tones i was afraid of
this suppose some preacher came aboard
to pay us a visit when we get to port sup-
pose one did and when he asked me if my
men had bibles i had to tell him no you
may well hang your dirty heads but ill
change all that im going to serve out
bibles to every one of you you know
what happens if you dont treat them right
the man that tears or anyway mishandles
one of these bibles knows what is coming to
him

  i wouldnt do this usually but you de-
manded religious liberty the british em-
pire is founded on religious hberty so i
have to let you have it and this is a
british ship even if most of you is either
dutchmen or runaways that no country will
own you shall have your religious liberty
but im thinking that most of you will wish
that you had let me teach you now every
one of you read these bibles youd better
because next week im going to ask every
man questions in his watch below and the
man that fails to answer any bible question
i ask will suffer them what cant read
get the others to read to them and dont
dirty them bibles the voice rose again
steward serve out bibles to every man in
the forecastle religious liberty eh-well
now you have charts to help you find your
way

        dante assisted by milton
lllll might possibly describe the awful
misery of the kenyons forecastle
during the next few days the
superstition regarding bibles terrified an-
ticipation of captain parrots intended
questioning terrified possibility of harm
coming to the bibles also terrified the men
who could read were afraid to read and the
men who could not read were afraid be-
cause they couldnt

  and then of course the fine weather left
them and the fair wind became foul it is
reasonable to suppose that hard case pol
had counted on this meteorlogical assist-
ance but to the men it was the working
of the dire superstition and they wondered
who was the jonah who had torn a leaf
the second day of the gale with the deck
full of water and the kenyon under a goose-
winged main lower topsail the men could
stand it no longer in forty-eight hours the
threatened examination was due and not a
man had read a line religious hberty was
s

the mutiny	

good but freedom from fear was better
and there had been at least seventeen fights
peters indeed could hardly walk

  and so captain parrot stamping briskly
about the weather side of the poop observed
his men standing humbly to leeward one
of them bearing a bible carefully protected
under his oilskins approached after the man-
ner of a nubian slave to a roman emperor
captain parrot sir

  parrot walked to and fro for three min-
utes as if he had not heard then suddenly
in fearful tones-

  well what is it

  if you please sir-if you please we
thinks you had better teach us we-we
aint quite enough educated for that there
religious liberty sir

  parrot bore down on the men his frown
a threatening weapon

  are those bibles in good shape

  oh yes sir we got em all wrapped
up sir and clean

  give me one of them

  from the many hastily offered parrot
selected a bible

 steward he yelled down the com-
panion-way

  and when the steward appeared-

  collect those bibles and stow them
away

  this was done and the captain with a
gesture drove the men aft by the wheel to
where he had first essayed to teach religion
the wind cut like a knife of myriad blades
the spray and sleet sang wildly across the
ship but the men felt almost happy even
when the captain began to read in thunder-
ous tones about moses and the plagues of
egypt while they shivered in the cold
even then when they thought of the misery
of the past few days even then they felt
happy

  now said parrot severely now
im going to read the bible to you heathen
whenever i feel that you need it day or
night by the time im done with you
youll know something about it liberty
means knowledge and responsibility and
when i have given you the first and youre
fit for the second you wont have to make
any fool round robins

  he looked carefully to windward

fate and the fish-hooks

by thomas

j-t- fisherwoman of many

i	moods is fate when she has

    hooked a man she may either
i   jerk him to his doom with one
turn of the wrist or she may play him round
the world and back again

  to william swallow as he stumbled on
board the colonial brig cyprus at hobart
town in van diemens land on a fine
september morning in the year  it
seemed that the last fatal jerk had been
given with fifty convict companions all
heavily ironed and dressed like him in the
hideous yellow uniform liberally sprinkled
with broad arrows which gave to the
long-sentenced prisoners the nickname of
canaries he was bound to the hell of
macquarie harbor they felt that they
were pot only as good as dead but a great
deal worse

  for forty years great britain had been
using australia as a dumping ground for
the surplus population of her prisons the
island of van diemens land later to
change its name to tasmania was one vast
prison of which macquarie harbor was the
center midway in an iron-bound coast
beaten upon by the huge sea which driven
by the westerly winds that sweep right
round the world in these latitudes rolls
without a break from the far off shores of
tierra del fuego the narrow passage known
as hells gate opens into a broad harbor
on the landward side wild mountains cov-
ered with thick forest dripping with almost
perpetual rain barred escape

  men who had tried to escape through
these inhospitable forests had been driven
to cannibalism by hunger only one man
alexander pearce the man-eater had won
through to the settled country beyond
with seven other convicts he had broke
loose from the gangs which worked at felling
huge trees floating them down to the settle-
ment and cutting them up  the little stock
of provisions that they had contrived to
save from their scanty rations were soon
exhausted

  two men turned back and gave them-
selves up the other six struggled on
through the dark forest without food with-
out fire wet through day and night then

dunbabin

they came to a river that they could not
cross one of them travers had fallen
lame his companions killed and ate him
as the only means of saving their lives
strengthened by this abhorrent food they
crossed the river and worked their way
through the woods beyond hunger again
assailed them and they drew lots the
man who drew the shortest stick was killed
and his mates devoured his raw flesh so
it went on till but two men remained-
pearce and matthew greenhill pearce
was unarmed while greenhill had an ax

  for three days and three nights they
never slept each waiting for the other to
give way greenhill gave out first pearce
killed him with his own ax and then strip-
ped the flesh from his bones the flesh of
the last survivor of his five companions gave
pearce strength to struggle out into the
open country he gave himself up desiring
as he said rather to die than to live he
had his wish for he died on the gallows at
hobart town

  such was the port to which the cyprus
was to carry swallow and his fifty fellow
convicts a place of horror and gloom where
desperate men drew lots to see which
would kill the other and where the lucky
one was he who drew the lot which made him
the victim

  yet with the help of a few fish-hooks fate
was to give swallow  miles of fine and
then with the aid of those same fish-hooks
to bring him back to captivity

  when she had run a quarter of the 
miles between hobart town and hells
gate the cyprus lay becalmed in recher-
che bay waiting for the breeze which would
enable her to turn the corner of the island at
whale head there were fish-hooks on
board and fish to be caught in the bay so
the soldiers of the guard took a boat and
went fishing

  while they were away swallow and his
canaries rose on those who remained on
board and took the vessel when the
fishermen returned from their fishing they
were caught too guards and seamen
alike were put ashore to make their way to
hobart town with them went several
women wives of officers accompanying
fate and fishhooks



their husbands to macquarie harbor the
men whom fate had made prisoners in their
turn were forced to dress in the yellow uni-
forms of the convicts while swallow and his
men masqueraded in the clothes of the
officers and sailors the women left behind
them rich dresses ornaments and trinkets
they seemed of little use to swallow but
everything has its value

  when the breeze so long awaited did come
the cyprus did not round whale head but
stood away for new zealand swallow had
been a sailor in his day serving in american
vessels and he could set a course and sail a
ship little use as most of his new crew were

  the cyprus never reached port but a few
weeks later captain billy worth of the
brothers and captain john guard of the
waterloo two sydney whaling schooners
lying at anchor at port underwood on
tie new zealand coast were surprized by
the appearance of an american brig the
friends of boston which had called in for
wood and water on a voyage from manila
to the west coast of south america

  the friends had been newly painted black
and the letters of her name were fresh and
bright though her master captain walk-
er whom his crew sometimes addressed as
swallow was evidently a smart sailor and
spoke with a down east accent there was
little of the discipline common on american
vessels in fact the rough and ready look-
ing crew behaved in a very free and easy
fashion

  a couple of days after the arrival of the
stranger urias allender a harpooner on the
waterloo decided that it might be worth
while to catch something smauer than
whales urias allender came from hobart
town and unlike many whalers of his day
he could read print to fish he needed
hooks and having none he borrowed a few
from a sailor on the friends of boston the
hooks were wrapped in a bit of torn news-
paper newspapers were rare in old new
zealand and allender glanced at it

  there was a familiar look about it
urias soon found that it was a bit of the
colonial times published in hobart
town a few weeks earlier obviously
the story that the friends of boston had
come direct from manila was a cock-and-
bull yarn when he had finished his fishing
for he was a man who believed in finishing
one thing before beginning another allender
told captain guard of his discovery

  

  he also told him that while her color was
different the friends of boston looked to
him the image of the van diemens land
brig cyprus guard took fire at the idea of
seizing the vessel and her crew of runaway
convicts there was a reward to be earned
which might be worth more than many
whales but guards crew alone was
heavily outnumbered by swallows crew of
desperate runaways

  so guard went to worth with his story
it looked as if fate were tired of playing
with her fish but worth a most unusual
thing with the whaling schooners of the day
had his wife on board and mrs worth had
a word to say swallow with a generosity
not without a touch of calculation had
given to her some of the stuffs and trinkets
left behind by the officers wives sent ashore
in recherche bay he invented an expla-
nation for their presence on board which
was convincing enough for mrs worth

  now his generosity with other peoples
goods was amply repaid

  your business is to catch whales not to
put your head into a mares nest on the
strength of some story about a fish-hook and
a newspaper she said to her husband as
to captain walker if there were more men
like him the world would be a better place

  the gray mare was the better horse and
worth refused to join in the attack lack-
ing his help guard could not act and the
friends of boston sailed in peace ill-
found as she was for a long voyage swal-
low drove her north across the pacific by
sheer force of character he established some
sort of discipline amongst his reckless
riotous crew when they would have
settled in some pleasant island of the south
seas he reminded them that they ran the
risk of being plucked thence by a british
warship as the fifteen convicts who had
carried away the schooner phoebe from the
shoalhaven river in new south wales had
been plucked from the society islands only
the year before

  so they pushed far to the north and after
months of voyaging made a landfall on the
coast of the hermit kingdom of japan then
still closed to foreigners as it had been for
two centuries and not to be visited by ad-
miral perry for another quarter of a cen-
tury seven men rightly confident that
the long arm of the british navy would not
reach them in this unknown land and
assured that for them japan could not be


adventure

worse than van diemens land went ashore
in one of the ships boats and stayed there

  if he could have read aright the men of
the fish-hooks swallow might have done the
same but he had other plans he had
sailed in american vessels and he knew that
canton was a port to which they much re-
sorted he pointed out to his companions
that once they reached america they would
be safe they might even if they cared to
do so turn respectable and become citizens
of credit as others had done in like case

  to reach america in the battered cyprus
was hopeless so off the mouth of the can-
ton river the friends of boston foundered
at sea and her crew reached canton in the
boats for the moment all went well the
committee of supercargoes at canton pro-
vided for the distressed mariners until they
could ship in outward-bound vessels as sur-
vivors of a new england vessel they showed
a natural desire to ship in american ships

  but while swallow was still waiting for a
ship a vessel arrived from sydney amongst
her crew was urias allender once a har-
pooner on the waterloo who had borrowed
fish-hooks at fort underwood on the
waterside at canton he met the man who
had lent him the hooks wrapped in a bit of
newspaper urias talked and some of
swallows men had babbled under the spell
of rice spirit

  when the crew of the friends of boston
left canton they sailed in a limejuicer all
those that the committee of supercargoes
had been able to lay hold of were in irons
and bound to london from london they
were sent back the weary voyage to van
diemens land

  at hobart town they were placed on
their trial on a charge of piracy on the high
seas the case was clear and the humanity
which swallow and his followers had shown
when they seized the cyprus in recherche
bay setting the guard and crew on shore
stood them in evil stead with cruel
mercy their fives were spared and they were
sent to macquarie harbor instead of to the
gallows like others in the same case they
begged as a favor that they might be hanged
out of hand but the boon was denied
them

  on a fine spring morning in the year 
the survivors of the fifty men who had been
driven on board the cyprus went on board
the schooner prince leopold bound for
macquarie harbor they were chained to
one another attached to the right leg of
each by a stout chain was the heavy ball
that gave to those who wore it for long a
limp that never left them as long as life
lasted

  this time there was no clam in recherche
bay and no use for the fish-hooks of fate

atburpart story-part iii

 ty leonard h nason

author of eye-wash rockets at daybreak etc

the first part of the story briefly retold in story form

t was in june  that we routed the french

  at dettingen in bavaria we had been without
food or fodder for many a day and as soon as the
french broke leaving open the road to hanau the
army forgot the enemy in its eagerness to reach its
base of supplies	

  my nag was in such a plight that i was left be-
hind and in the night came upon a french officer
and killed him after a long-drawn fight i relieved
him of a fine sword rings gold buttons and other
booty then austrian marauders our allies set
upon me badly wounded i lay out in the marshes
until a party of our own men found me and carted
me to hanau

  a physician named gulf took me into his house
and cared for me in exchange for one of the rings i
had taken from the frenchman when the army
marched out of hanau i was left behind for i was
still very weak some days later i was discharged
although i was in no state to travel and the doctor
would have robbed me of my last gold button had i
given him the chance

  at a near-by tavern i met a youth viscount bar-
net who had deserted his post because he wished to
reach england in a great hurry an estate awaited
him there but he was without funds and in debt
he suggested that i let him exchange my booty for
money lend half the sum to him and that we travel
together to the coast this i agreed to do although
gulf cursed me for a fool and went so far as to offer
me a commission in the army of the pretender
charles stuart but i cursed him back and left his
house

  we started the viscount and i in the frankfort
diligence but were held up by a scouting party
which tried to slaughter us for the officer knew that
barnet was a deserter we were almost beaten
when a party of horsemen that i had seen at gulfs

house came to our rescue they cut down the
scouting party and rode away no sign could i find
of barnet until i reentered the diligence and found
him hiding beneath a bale of goods

  do you owe those men money i asked

  well not money but something of the sort
said he and then would speak no more but held his
peace chewing upon his fingers

when we reached frankfort we hired horses to
continue our journey a fortnight later we
put up at an inn near brussels where there were
many english officers one of them picked a quar-
rel with us and the viscount killed him he es-
caped leaving me to defend myself as best i might
until knocked down and sorely beaten

  i awoke in a stable midden the viscount was
there and helped me mount my horse and away
but i was so weak and bruised that i could not sit
my horse and fell off very soon barnet left me for
he was in grave danger agreeing to meet me at the
sign of the gaper in the town of williamstadt

  next day i found that the viscount had taken my
last penny and i had to beg my way afoot to the
seaport there i found an english boat whose
skipper first took me later to the sign of the gaper
where i was told that the viscount had sailed the
week before for england and then aboard his vessel

  i slept so soundly that i awoke only when we were
well out to sea on board were the six travelers
who had saved us from the scouting party they
disclosed themselves as agents of the pretender and
their leader asked me to serve with them when i
stoutly refused i was given until we reached the
coast to agree to his proposal or die

  when we hove to however we were set upon by
gagers and soldiery and i escaped in the dark the
near-by villagers were in arms becausea local tavern

adventure

keeper had been taken by the press gang and forced
to enlist after being embroiled with them for half
a night i broke away and made my way across the
moor until a coach overtook me and i climbed into
the rumble-tumble i slept soundly until the
coach was halted by a highwayman i hid by the
roadside my sword still lying in the rumble-tumble

m y next thought was for the im-
petuous gentleman who had tried
to seize the highwayman i had
v-j to paw around in the dark for
some time before i found him for the
impetus of his rush from the coach had
carried him off the road and under the
hedge

  i kicked against the robbers first pistol
where he had dropped it when he drew the
other and then i felt of a boot and so to my
gentleman whom i found lying on one el-
bow fumbling at his broken head and trying
to gather his scattered wits

  whos that he demanded hoarsely

  then as a recollection came upon him he
rolled upon his other side and after a mo-
ments search thrust a purse at me

  keep your purse i ordered you
have the wrong man jack-of-the-roads
is gone and is half way to the next town by
now can you walk

  ill know better in a minute said he
drawing out from under the hedge where
after a little effort he stood upright that
was a sad knock he fetched me said the
man reeling a little but who might you
be

  i was riding in the rumble-tumble said
i and ducked into the ditch where the
shadow of the hedge kept me from being
seen

  where is the coach

  gone on said i fast enough and here
we are in the midst of this forsaken dingle
and night set in

  there will be a moon he suggested
hopefully

  not for some time said i if you will
remember last night

  that is true he agreed it will rise late
well we can not be far from an inn for the
coach inns at dark and it was just at night-
fall that this wolf set upon us we have but
to follow the road i suppose our man will
give us no trouble now that he has all our
money

  i doubt if he returns but yet he might
have you a sword i asked

  pauls blood cried the man clapping

until the coach drove off then i leaped out of hiding
and took possession of the highwaymans loot one
man who had tried to resist sprawled unconscious
and unnoticed in the middle of the path

  having relieved the highwayman of his ill-gotten
gains i hdped him to mount with the toe of my boot
and sent him on his way

hand to his thigh i left it in the coach
have you

  in the coach but here is a pistol the
highwayman dropped it may be useful as
a club i have one of my own that will bite
i repeat i doubt if he returns he went away
fast enough

  with our gold to speed him added the
young man

  you lost no money i reminded him
perhaps not he said but the others
did if my foot had not caught on the edge
of the step not a one would have been a
groat the poorer i would have wrung that
poaching ruffians neck i warrant you
doubtless i agreed dryly but they
are none the poorer nevertheless for i have
secured what was taken

  by the teeth of - cried he i

think you are the rogue himself if it were
not so dark i could be surer secured what
was taken hear him a sheep takes its
prey from the wolf the hawk drops its plun-
dered fowl when bidden if it were lighter
you might see that there is no green in my
eye come i suppose the thief was stricken
in conscience and gave it you back

  if i were a thief i replied in as stern a
tone as i could muster i would have pis-
toled you out of hand and left you to rot
under the hedge i would also inform you
that you speak to hugh bancroft late of
ligoniers regiment of horse and one not

used to having the he in his teeth be--

to you and i turned to stride off

  true enough he muttered hold
i want no quarrel with you wait now
this blow upon my skull has addled me i
am wrong my hand

  now when this man had first spoken his
speech was so thick and dazed that i could
scarce tell what he said but as he came to
himself and spoke more clearly it seemed to
me that i had heard his voice before where
i could not at that moment tell but heard
it i had and no doubt of it i tried to see
his face but could not for it was so dark
in that cursed dingle that i could not so
much as make out the shape of his hat

  so we set off together my companion
the bold dragoon



stopping from time to time and swearing
to himself once i heard the lock of his
pistol click and there being no good reason
why he should cock it i let down the ham-
mer of mine with my thumb and then hauled
it back again loudly so that he should know
that i was also armed

  it is a difficult thing to hit a man in the
dark i remarked

  aye said he so it is

  and after that we held no morq speech
we continued for some time in this man-
ner he complaining from to time of his bro-
ken head and at last reached the outskirts
of a town of some size a short way down
the principal street was the inn where the
coach rested overnight and thither we took
our way the innyard was deserted the
coach had been rolled under a kind of shed
where it kept company with several carters
wagons their poles propped on sticks
pointing to the stars there was no sign of
life here save a few skulking dogs but a
cheery light shone from the windows of the
common room and a very pleasant odor of
baking meat saluted us

  presently we came into the light from the
window and my companion turned his face
away but not so quickly but what i saw
who he was it was my merry viscount

  ha said i my hand on his collar
well met by cock and pie

  let go your hand my bouncing dra-
goon said he i knew you when you
rapped out your name so vigorously a half
hour agone listen i have news of import
for you never think i abandoned you
what i waited two weeks for you but my
affairs pressed i had to go now come in
let us drink a dram or two and all shall be
made clear

  i had my doubts of him but now that
he was under my hand we might as well go
in as stand chinning in that dark inn-yard
where it was cold and unsavory so we went
to the door and so entered

within before the great hearth
there was a small company the
merchant stood with his back to
the blaze declaiming and the two
countrymen who had ridden with us listened
with gaping mouths there were three or
four others there people of the neighbor-
hood and a beribboned sergeant either on
his way to join a recruiting party or return-
ing to london after having left one

  the inns host skipped merrily about now
running out to the kitchen to watch the prog-
ress of the cooking now bending at some
ones demand for another jack of ale and
ever and anon glancing about to be sure
that there were no sneakers there and that
every one present was paying for the warmth
of the fire by buying generously of the inns
drinkables

  it was after one of these hurried glances
that the host discovered us standing in the
shadow of the door at once he swooped
at us and catching a lanthorn from behind
the settle he lifted it high and inspected us

  wot ave we ere he demanded coarse-
ly now then speak up lads wot can
we do for you but first therell be no
sleeping in the ay and so you may save
your breath by not harsking for it

  i was so struck down by this greeting
that i could find no reply-indeed i am
slow of speech at best-but the viscount
rapped out a volley of oaths and striding
forward caught mine host by the collar of
his smock and nigh throttled him

  - your blood cried the viscount

here is a pretty way to treat a gentleman
by the hair of luke i will toast you at your
own fire

  here the merchant ceased his exhortation
on the unsafeness of the highways and
watched what was going forward with his
jaw hanging

  rooms and food and a hot drink and

quick too continued the viscount -s

blood no sleeping in the hay ill hay
you

  and he fell to beating the host with the
full strength of his arm the company
arose and pried the two apart

  peace cried the merchant i am a
magistrate and i command you both to lay
down your arms and abide in peace under
penalty of invocation of the statutes made
and provided against public brawling why
bless my soul he exclaimed in astonish-
ment it is the viscount hold hard land-
lord stop beating that young man i know
him well it is viscount barnet what
landlord stop it now

  inasmuch as the landlord was quite black
in the face and could but feebly parry the
shower of blows the viscount was pouring
upon him it was difficult to see what the
landlord should stop the attacker how-
ever held his hand and suffered the poor
host to rise gasping and clawing at his throat
 

adventure

  ah good young man cried the mer-
chant safe and sound safe and sound
we were mustering our force here you see
mustering our force to go out and find you
we were to apply to the law here we were
to have out the possecomitatus we were to
rouse the country with bell and blaze but
now you are here and it is not necessary
tell us how you are ho a glass of wine
here wine for the viscount

  several of the company laid aside various
weapons that they had and hastened to
bring wine while the rest bustled about for
napkins plasters and such like to bind the
viscounts wound when he had had a
glass of wine and a peg or two from the
leathern jack the viscount waved them all to
silence and began his explanation

  the poor host still wobbling his neck and
feeling of his throat humbly contrived to
apologize pointing out that the lanthorn gave
but a feeble light that the viscount was
quite bloody and had upon him a great deal
of mire where he had lain under the hedge
and moreover not arriving with the coach
the landlord had thought him one of the
many masterless rogues discharged soldiers
and runaway apprentices that were continu-
ally beseeching him for barn room to all
this the viscount turned a deaf ear but hav-
ing had another peg from the leathern jack
he began his account of his adventures

  now then gentlemen you remember
when the robber had discharged his pistol
by accident and i had rushed forth to seize
him that he was adroit enough to fetch me
a knock on the skull with it by token of my
tripping over the door sill of the coach
now being somewhat stunned i lay for a
while under the hedge whither i had fallen
and it was thus that this dust came upon me

  here the viscount had another peg of ale
all this time i had stood without the circle
of firelight waiting until some one should
take notice of me and having a good
stomach for a bit of ale myself for the night
was chill but now that the viscount had
started upon his tale none gave me any heed
being all too eager to hear one of the gentry
talk to them and being deeply interested
for themselves since the highwayman had
been the chief interest about the fire before
we had come in

  at any rate thinks i now that he has
started upon his tale he must very soon
come to that part that i played in it and
then i shall receive some attention

  having lain under the hedge for some
time continued the viscount i came to
my senses just as the coach departed and as
i lay hearkening i heard one arise from the
ditch and draw up to where the robber sat
his horse

   -s gates said a voice here is a

poor bag for there was no one in the coach
but a merchant and two farmers but the
merchant had considerable gold in his boots
and a watch and a wig all of which i light-
ened him of

   no said another voice there were
four you have missed a very handsome
and brave young man a viscount and i
warrant you he hath a well-lined purse for
he has all the look of a man of high connec-
tions

   why to be sure continued the first
speaker he attacked me and fell under
the hedge i had forgotten him

   give me the sack said the second man
and let us haul out this cockerel from under
the hedge 

  the viscount then had another glass of
wine while i wondered with humming brain
what this was all coming to i had begun
to have a feeling that it boded me no good
after the viscounts memory had been re-
freshed with the draft he began again

  the man on foot came to me where i lay
and hauled me out by the heels while the
man on horseback watched but they found
that i was a bird of a different color my
pistol i discharged at the mounted man who
fled shrieking and i doubt not but what he
is now dead and the other i seized by the
throat and demanded him in king georges
name to yield which he incontinently did-
and there he stands

here he pointed directly at me
ski and i like the lackwit i was
kail could but drop my jaw at him
and gasp but when they moved
at me to seize me i found voice

  you he in your throat i cried you

- hamstringing hound its not true

i was a passenger in the coach

  search him then cried the viscount
see if he hath not the booty upon him
he lies cried the merchant i never
saw him before

  un was not on coorch wi us agreed the
farmers nodding their heads vigorously

  i rode in the rumble i shouted at them
my sword and valise are still there and i
the bold dragoon



have papers that will soon enough prove
who i am

  the viscount bit his up at this and swore
that i but sought to gain time but the ser-
geant took up his stand at the dpor and the
landlord rushed out into the yard and across
to where the coach lay under the shed

  there is a case of pistols and a sword in-
side called the viscount after him fetch
them to me

  there were no further words until we
heard the hosts shoes clattering over the
stones and he rushed in with the viscounts
pistols under his arm and a sword in his
hand he came close to me and gave me a
searching look in which there was less of
animosity than i would have expected and
turning to the company he announced-
this ere is the honly sword in the coach
and there is naught in the rumble but bales
of wool and ides

  he is a thief shrieked the merchant
upon him search him my watch and
gold

  hark forward hark forward tally-
ho whooped the viscount hounding them
at me as if i were a fox and they the pack

  i resisted as best i might but i am slight-
ly built and light for a dragoon and the
stable boys and hostlers having run in at
the sound of the alert and the drawers and
women folk from the kitchen lending a hand
the first leaping at me and the second pull-
ing my hair most grieviously it was not long
before they had me down my pistol plucked
from my belt and the merchant gleefully
dragged the sack containing the gold from
my pocket

  it is true he cried it is true and he
chuckled and rubbed his hands together
there is my clock and my seals and all my
gold untouched o brave my lord o bold
young man and he fell on the viscounts
neck

  has un gotten our horn snuff box
asked the farmer that hung on my arm
zee if un has

  none offered to find the snuff box how-
ever and the poor man had to be content
with twisting my arm and very nearly hav-
ing it out by the roots

  for my part i was not silent during this
time but shouted the right of the story at
the top of my lungs now and again telling
the viscount my opinion of him and what i
should do to him when i should be released
the word had meanwhile gotten forth

that there had been a highwayman taken
in the inn and numbers of the townspeople
crowded in armed with bills and forks and
shouting till their throats were nigh to
cracking many of them came close and
peered at me to see if i was of their acquaint-
ance and finding that i was not continued to
howl and hoot

  many of these honest citizens have traffic
with the gentlemen of the road giving them
fire food and candle and helping them dis-
pose of their stolen goods but seeing that i
was not one of their customers they were
nothing loath to see me hanged out of hand

  all the while that i was being hurried up
and down and pushed and shoved and every
one reaching to take a buffet-at me i had
noticed from time to time when i could get
my head clear that the landlord stood on a
bench a little apart regarding me fixedly and
once i could swear he made me a sign of en-
couragement what this could mean since
it had been he that had betrayed me by say-
ing there was no sword or valise in the coach
i could in no wise make out after a time
he descended from his bench and swinging
a bung mallet ordered the townspeople out
cursed the stable boys back to their kennel
and hurled the women from the room

  now then he announced looking
around him lets ave im locked up for the
night and well ave im before squire in the
morning

  the men that hung to me had increased
from two to twice that number or more and
at his suggestion they followed the host
across the darkened yard the whole of us
moving at a shambling run and i heard
them fumbling at the fastenings of a door
and calling for a light

  at last there was the creaking of a hinge
and i was hurled into a small windowless
room the dim ray of a coach lanthorn
held by one of the men showed me a row of
musty great-coats and a great pile of saddles
and harness in a corner then the door
swung to and i was left in darkness

  at the first i had no thought but to curse
and kick upon the door but i soon found
that i wasted my breath and made my foot
sore so i desisted and sat down on the pile
of saddles to think what was best to be done

  this was a pleasant homecoming for a cer-
tainty here i was not a week in england
and in a fair way to be strangled for an-
others crime the reaction of the excite-
ment weakened me exceedingly a grateful


adventure

 country mine indeed having wellnigh
 given up my life for her in flanders now
 that i was broken and fit for no more fight-
 ing invalided home landing on the shore
 almost penniless the very people for whom
 i had fought were all for hanging me on the
 word of a scoundrel they had never seen
 before

   for the viscounts conduct it was easy
 enough to find a reason he was a scoun-
 drel and a cur and my sudden appearance
 - embarrassing him he had taken this means
 of getting rid of me the landlord how-
 ever was different as for saying that
 there was no baggage in the rumble it might
 have been stolen by one of the hangers on
 the rest of his actions were unexplainable
 the whiteness of his face when he returned
 and his curious looks at me from the bench
 now that i thought of it i could have sworn
 that his eyelid flickered at me

    i pulled down several of the old coats to
 cover me and what with weakness and the
 fatigue of the journey and the nights battle
 i fell asleep to be awakened by a chill blast
 across my face to my surprize the door
 stood ajar and though it was still dark i
 could hear cocks crowing lustily the next
 instant a hand brushed my face and seized
 me by the shoulder

   come hout sir come hout panted a
 husky voice

    still half asleep i staggered out the door
 which was at once clapped to behind me a
 sword hilt was thrust into my hand-mine

 it was mine i would know it at -s

 mouth

    i am very sorry sir if you have been in-
 convenienced continued the voice but
 this is no place for a gentleman of the honest

 party here are all - tories your

 sword sir will give you away and an hex-
 press has been through that you and your
 friends are about now sir to orse and be
 on your way before daylight

   i was by now fully awake and when the
 explanation came to me i could scarce stifle
 a laugh england was as i have said fair
 torn in two between stuart and hanover
 no man knew the true state of neighbors
 politics and here this poor rogue misled by
 the fact that an alarm had been sent out of
 the landing of the jacobites had taken me
 for one because of my french sword the
 carrying of such a weapon would be cause
 enough for question when the very cut of
 a mans wig would bring suspicion of

espousing the pretenders cause upon him

  here the landlord appeared leading a
horse with my valise strapped to the sad-
dle

  leave him at the child and boot said
he  e will be taken care of your honor
will forgive me for not bringing in your
sword with that soldier there and all the
rest you would ave been lost hindeed if
i might make so bold change your clothes
and get another sword for it will be a ang-
ing matter else

  i thanked the man as civilly as i could
and belted on the sword the horse was a
sorry hack i could tell by the feel of his
backbone but he would carry me to safety
at least and if the man thought me a jacob-
ite the more fool he

  a stirrup cup now cried the landlord
reaching me a mug and then filling one him-
self he added the kings health at the
same time swinging his arm over the horse
trough which is a trick these gentry have
it signifying over the water and they
drink thus to their king over the water who
skulks in italy behind a hedge of petticoats

  king george god bless him said i and
slapping the crowbaits ribs i clattered from
the yard leaving the poor wretch to put
what construction he might upon my ac-
tions it was a foolish thing to do and he
might very well raise the hue and cry after
me and then he might not for he would
have his own part to explain

  as for me a health to george for he had
taken the field with us at dettingen and led
us gallantly and well a thing no king had
done before for a long time nor has any done
it since

  so then having a beast-one could scarce
call it a horse-beneath me and my sword
on my thigh once more i proceeded toward
london and the sun rose up and lighted me
on my way

  before i had gone very far from the un-
happy inn i bethought me that if the land-
lord should have a change of heart-and it
was very likely that he would since i had re-
fused to toast the pretender-it would be
easy to trace me by the crowbait that i be-
strode so shortly after day i turned him
loose to go home or wander about the fields
as he saw fit and hailed a great wagon that
was passing laden with two families going
up to london

for a very slight sum they took me in and
the rest of the day and the night i rode in
the bold dragoon

                



the wagon very sore with the jolting of it
and with the crawling over me of the innu-
merable brats that were part of the cargo

chapter vi

of my poverty in the city

we came into the city early in the
morning of the following day i had
in mind offering my services to some gentle-
man going to the indies or the virginias and
with this in view i went down to the docks
and spent the day there but had my labor
for my pains and when night fell i turned
into the first street that opened in search of
lodgings i was fortunate to secure them
in water lane for five shillings the week
and miserable enough they were a room
with no fire but all that i could afford

  i spent after that a wretched week it
would seem that in all this great city with
its thousands and thousands of people there
might be some place where a man with a
knowledge of horses a veteran of dettingen
and endowed with youth and health enough
to walk about could find employment

  i used to stand many a morning in cheap-
side and watch the apprentices taking down
the shutters of the drapers and goldsmiths
and the haberdashers shops and think it ill
that all these should have employment and
i none then i would go through the poul-
try to lombard st and so down fish hill to
the waterside and thence to billingsgate
where the fishwives gathered to wait for the
ringing of the high-water bell to go to
gravesend this was the only amusement
i had watching them fight and i learned a
number of new words from hearing them
curse

  as the week advanced and my money
grew less i became desperate here were
many people earning their daily bread and i
was denied mine i thought for a time of
selling brooms or costards or some of the
simples that were cried about the streets
but the thought of a soldier a dragoon no
less and a wounded veteran of the last cam-
paign going about london crying brooms
here buy my brooms or clove water
stomach water was too jnuch

  my clothes were of the cheapest to begin
with and traveling in carts and sleeping in
them which i had to do to keep myself
warm had not improved them so that they
were in such state that no jew in st mary
axe would give me a farthing for them

  even the ragged boys that hung about
the crossings with brooms to sweep them
clear of mud and then demand a penny for
the service would take one look at me and
never stir a hairs breadth one of the imps
went so far as to offer me his broom crying
that i had more need of a crossing to sweep
than he

  it was upon the evening of the seventh
day after i had been to the kings mews in
search of employment and thence to st
james park that as i was passing a tavern
a number of soldiers came out one of
these brushed roughly against me in passing
and then turned to glare at me both he
and i whooped loudly in concert for i recog-
nized nick dashbaugh who had been with
me in flanders

  well well he shouted i never would
have known you in that rig what did
you get safe away from the mob you
have had no time to tell me your luck since
dettingen do you know that the deacon
has grown into a cornetcy we are giving

his commission a wet tonight - my

teeth but you must come on our way
now move out and you can tell me your
story as we go

  in spite of my protests he dragged me off
and indeed i was not very loath for i had
had nothing to eat all day

  it is not much of a story i told him
after the battle a number of us were out
gleaning what we could do we had gone
down by the morass and i had found me a
french officer who had upon him some rich
rings and a sum of money after i had fin-
ished his affair i was set upon by a party of
horse perhaps they were stragglers per-
haps a detachment from the enemy rear
guard but i still believe to this day that
they were austrians

  well whoever they were i was cut down
at the first onset and being left in the marsh
had a fever and was very near death so i
was invalided and discharged because my
lord cumberland felt that i was no more use
and so tossed me aside like an old shoe

  i then told them of my meeting with the
viscount and of his treachery

  a scurvy trick remarked dick but
you come with us and youll forget all your
troubles then in the morning we can see
what can be done

  i suppose you got safely away from the
riot how did you make out after the loss
of your recruit
io

adventure

why we just took justice dawley he
fearing for his life and recruited him
what became of my friend the squire
ha ha being a hearty fellow though
a little ripe we plied him with liquor and re-
cruited him too

  well where is this wet to be i asked
him when i had done laughing

  at the seven moons he replied in
gough square

  good then we can stop at my lodging
and i can get my sword i have no craving
to be abroad after nightfall and unarmed
i left dashbaugh sitting on the door sill
while i climbed the stairs and belted on my
picinino which with its silver-chased basket
hilt went very ill with the rest of me and
then went down and so to the seven moons

  when we were still some distance off we
could hear a great tumult and when we en-
tered the tap room the room was so thick
with tobacco that one could scarce see
they were roaring some catch and after a
minute or two i could make out the words
those of a very famous one and a great favo-
rite with us in flanders

          fill the cup phillip

          and let us drink a drain

         once or twice about the house
         and end where we began

  it was sometime before the company per-
ceived that we had entered and when they
did they welcomed us uproariously the
deacon in whose honor the wet was being
held was already upsee-freeze or in other
words stiff drunk and had been rolled into
a corner but the spirits of the rest were at
their highest

  now i never was any great man at the
bowl and since my wound i had no head at
all so as soon as i perceived that the greater
part of the company were unknown to me
and that there was nothing to eat i made up
my mind to steal away from there as soon as
possible

they were drinking out of a
huge mug that must have held
several quarts and which was
pegged down the side with silver
pegs every man in his turn must sink the
liquor from one peg to the next and any one
detected in sneaking was forced to take a
double draft it was quite easy to detect
this last for the company looked into the
mug before each man drank and again after
he finished to be sure he had had his whole

peg after the fourth round they called
upon me for a song and i gave them

          it is a cold and stormy night

          im wetted to the skin

          but ill bear it with contentment

          until i reach the inn

         and then ill have a merry time
         with the landlord and his kin

  this was well liked and after the song was
ended i managed to steal away which i did
the more easily as the company had detected
dashbaugh in sneaking and were pleasantly
occupied in forcing a double draft down his
unwilling throat

  when i came into the street i had not the
slightest idea of the hour it was very cold
with a damp wind and a great promise of
fog i proceeded in the direction of water
lane halting now and again and resting
my head against the bricks of a wall to
cool my brow i must have had more than
i realized or else the drink had been of great
potency for my head was none of the light-
est and i had a desire to burst into song

  it was after one of these pauses that i be-
came conscious of a distant rumor a kind of
tumult higher up the hill in back of me i
listened as best i might for the buzzing in
my ears but could hear nothing save the
watchman in the next street crying lan-
thorn and candle light here maid a light
here for the householders to hang out lan-
thorns to light the street

  as i was about to go on i heard the
noise again and nearer hoots and howls
frightened squeaking and the crash of glass-
breaking a party of drunkards doubtless
or one of those bands of young men that
roam the streets after nightfall outraging
honest citizens and frightening housemaids
into fits

  whichever one it was i had no desire to
meet them and i went off at my best pace
clearing the skirts of my coat from the pici-
nino in case i should have use for it what
with my drunken head or my ill luck or my
lack of direction i had no sooner reached
the foot of the street and was about to cross
over to the next than a chair accompanied
by two linkboys turned the corner and after
it a crowd of men shouting and hollooing

  even as i watched they overtook their
quarry and were upon the chair with drawn
swords the linkboys and the chairmen
took to their heels i could hear a deal of
swearing and the thumping of swords upon
the chair roof and sides and very shortly
the bold dragoon



they had the occupant out he calling lustily
for the watch and they shouting with laugh-
ter

  unfortunately there was a light there a
lanthorn that the householder at that corner
had hung out and i had stopped directly
under its light so that some of the rascals
must have seen me for one cried out-

  go fetch him here and let us sweat the
two of them

  at this two or three came over the way
toward me with their swords in their hands
and i lugged out the picinino with a glorious
whing the three came to a halt at the
sound and looked rather adrift being sur-
prized to find not a poor shopkeeper
or middle-aged citizen but a stern-visaged
young man with a naked broadsword glim-
mering in the lanthorn light

  ho they cried blades here he
draws on us blades blades

  at this the whole party left their prey on
on the other side and rushed over toward me
crying

  he draws does he well draw him
tip him the lion tip him the lion heres a
comb to be cut well teach him sword-
play

  i set my back against the house and put-
ting the picinino in guard considered them
while they formed a half circle about me

  now i am no trouble hunter and certainly
not a brawler for as i have said i am of
slight build and light for a dragoon riding
as i do at scarce ten stone but here was
trouble thrust upon me and being in a man-
ner of speaking pot-valiant i felt no fear of
them but rather a keen enjoyment

  here was a band of young men idlers and
beaus for the most part who thought them-
selves successors to the scourers and mo-
hocs very brave in attacking chairmen and
linkboys but rather given to pause at the
sight of a sword that was made for killing
and not for ornament

  they stood about me swearing and call-
ing to each other to close in and settle the
matter but none dared to do more than to
point the brad awl he called a sword at me
so while they stood there of two minds
whether to close with me or let me alone and
go after easier game i stepped quickly for-
ward and had my steel into one of them
halfway to the hilt he went down with a
sobbing gasp and the rest of them gave back
a little

  then with a shout two or three surged at

me crying to the others to fall on ones
sword i shattered with a parade the other
had an inch or two of the picinino in his arm
and fled giving tongue like a kicked pup i

advanced again making the broadsword
glitter like a tongue of lightning and the
rest of them took their heels and fled down
the street

  i bent down to examine the man that i
had let my sword into and as i stooped my
foot slipped in his blood and i fell or that
moment had been my last the third man
of those three that had rushed at me had
lurked in the shadows and when i bent over
he had stepped out and thrust at me and
but for my slipping would have spitted me
i went for him

  by jonahs whale he cried ill slit
your crop like a capons

  then neither spoke again but fell to with
our tucks and thirsted for the others blood

the other man whose voice and
face half shadowed by his hat as
it was i could have sworn i recog-
nized was no mean antagonist
he had a light sword and stuck to the lower
guard attacking me with great vigor a
broadsword is no weapon for that kind of
fighting being a sword for different kind of
work indeed those who are masters of
it use a dagger to do their parrying using
the sword to thrust only

  howbeit i did what i could skipping
about and hacking at him whenever chance
offered but with the weight of the picinino
and the weakness from my recent wound
and the fact that i had eaten none too
heartily the past week or so i began to lose
strength rapidly

  the form of the other man began to blur
before my eyes there was a taste of blood in
my mouth and it seemed that i could not
bear the weight of my sword another in-
stant much less parry a thrust with it

  my antagonist feeling me growing weak-
er pressed his advantage and so fierce was
his attack and feeble my resistance that i
expected every instant to feel his sword
questing among my ribs i could see his
teeth gleaming in a smile of triumph he
made a strong thrust at me but the dark-
ness hindered him and he missed even
though i made no attempt to parry it

  this was my salvation for having my
sword still advanced while he was recover-
ing from the thrust i summoned what last
io

adventure

strength i had and cut down at his head
he parried just too late but the stroke was
so weak on my part that he managed to turn
the blade so that the flat and not the edge
struck him

  as it was his hat was flattened and he
went to his knees like a pole-axed bull i at
once set my foot upon his sword and resting
on the picinino tried to recover my breath
he got back his scattered wits at about the
time that i did my wind and tried to jerk his
sword from under my foot

  -you he cried you have killed

my best friend ill have your heart for

that by -

  drop it i ordered and shifting my foot
quickly from the blade i stamped on his
fingers so that he dropped the sword and
came for me with his bare hands i re-
treated menacing him with- my sword and
i began to fear that i should have to kill
him after all but he suddenly stopped and
sitting down on the steps of a house be-
gan to weep bitterly

  come said i stop your snotting and
if you will lend a hand well see if we can
not have a surgeon for your friend come
back now to the light and well see what
can be done

  yes he agreed lets go back he may
not be dead by the bones of timothy but
this is a sad nights work

  we went back to where the man that i
had thrust through lay in the ditch and i
picked up the two swords and cast them into
the sewer i went up the street a little way
and looked about me and then went back
to where the other man was loosening the
wounded mans clothing

  this is the foot of fetter lane said i
and my lodgings are but a little way off so
lets carry him there and then we can do
what may be necessary at any rate we
can not stay here to be taken by the watch
and i think there is some kind of a reward
for mohocs or any one caught disturbing
the peace of the city after nightfall

  i know not what to do cried the other
man chewing his fingers i know not
what way to turn

  catch hold of his heels i directed and
i will show you the turnings it is but a
step down fleet street and then we will
have him safe enough

  so my antagonist took hold of his friends
heels and i his head and we started on car-
rying him between us

  i could not at that time explain nor have
i been able to since why i should befriend
two rufflers and peace - breakers such as
these who but a moment before were doing
their best to kill me i think perhaps my
guiding angel had a hand in it for certain
it was that this nights events were to be the
turning point in my fortunes although i did
not know it for yet a long while

  presently we were come to my door and
had the wounded man up the stairs if any
one heard the noise of us they would only
think we were late revelers going to bed and
the sight of two men carrying a third was a
common enough one we laid the wounded
man on the mattress and i struck flint and
steel and lighted a candle

  now then i said let us get this damp
out of our bones with a little nip and i
reached out a bottle of wine that i had in
which there was about the width of three
fingers of liquid the other man looked up
at me and the rays of the candle fell full
on his face it was my rascal my double-
dealer my split-tongued liar my viscount

  for the space of half a dozen heart-beats
i looked at him but i had made no mistake
and i only wondered that i had not discov-
ered him before from the tones of his voice
his strange oaths and his habit of chewing
upon his fingers when in perplexity then
i stepped softly to the door and shot the bolt

  now my fine viscount quoth i turn-
ing about i have a score to settle with you
that has lacked payment over long

my antagonist started at
this like a spurred horse he
gazed intently into my stern face
for a moment and then throwing
himself into my one chair roared with
laughter

  by the head of john he cried if it is
not the gloomy dragoon why this is bet-
ter than a play here he went off into
another gale

  come i said your laughter is a little
out of place we have yet your friend to
attend to after which i know a man who
would do well to say his prayers

  at the mention of the wounded man the
viscount sobered instantly and with the
greatest concern he caught up the candle
and held it closely to his friends face

  come here he said to me his features
working piteously i fear-i fear he is
gone
the bold dragoon



  i took down a bit of mirror that i had and
held it before the wounded mans mouth
it came away clear i lifted one of his hands
and the chill of death was upon it i felt a
little sick at this but it had been the mans
own folly that had brought it upon him and
my greatest care now was how we might dis-
pose of the body

  is he dead asked the viscount with
tears in his eyes i nodded whereat the
other burst into weeping

  here thought i there are at least
some tender feelings in this man after all
it was hardly the time to call him to ac-
count for his betrayal of me at the inn now
that i had killed his dearest friend his broth-
er perhaps it might even be a good thing
to cry quits and at that the balance would
be in my favor

  enough i said at last dry up your
tears and be a man if that is possible your
friend is dead and all your groaning will not
bring him back if you cared as much for
him as all that you should not have suffered
him to scour about the streets and put him-
self in danger of being run through by some
honest citizen

  i weep not for him replied the vis-
count but for myself for that man was
to have been meat and drink to me the
next twelve month

  this remark fairly took the wind from me
i looked about for a place to rest for my
knees shook under me but there was none
other than the bed which the dead man
took up and the chair in which the viscount
sat finally i took my dragoons valise and
putting it on the floor sat down on it with
my back against the door and the picinino
across my knees

  the room was bitter cold and the candle
guttered and swayed in the draft from the
crazy window but though every bone in me
cried out and my eyelids were forever
drooping i resolved that i would have some
sense and satisfaction out of this blubbering
viscount cost what it might two bodies
could be dumped into the thames as easily
as one he began however to speak with-
out further urging from me

  i owe you an explanation indeed and
an apology he began i am a viscount
and the head of my house but that is all it
amounts to the entail of my estate was
broken up before i was bom and what with
gaming and wine and women and an unfor-
tunate venture by my elder brother with the

earl of derwentwater when i came to my
majority and the title there was nothing to
support either with my poor father in an
effort to restore his fortunes married a sec-
ond time the daughter of a london ship
owner

  ill fortune cried the viscount bitterly
has dogged the footsteps of my house for
generations my stepmothers father as
soon as the marriage had taken place pro-
ceeded to lose all his money so that my poor
father was again poverty-stricken and
straightway gave up the ghost i can not
blame him the slightest he had a posthu-
mous child a daughter and the shipowner
was mean enough to settle all that was left
of his fortune upon her she lives here in
london and gives me a little aid now and
then she is a girl of most disgusting vir-
tue and makes me promise that i will not
spend at the gaming table any of the money
she is so niggardly with

  surely an uplifting account i observed
but what has all this to do with me i am
not concerned with the wreck of your house
nor your brother who went out with the earl
of derwentwater and was probably knocked
in the head with all the rest of that rebel
crew

  ah said the viscount giving a little
moan and rolling his eyes if that rebellion
had only succeeded i might have been made
a duke

  be-to you and your dukes i cried

rising what of this dead man bleeding
all over my floor what of my five hun-
dred pounds and a worthless bond what
of a lying cur that put my neck in the shad-
ow of a rope not a fortnight since

  to my surprize the viscount made a com-
plete change of front he drew back his
chair and rose with a quiet dignity

  sir said he through his teeth you are
armed and i am not i have lost my sword
and you have me at your mercy but if you
will loan me a weapon i will be in a fair way
to make you eat your words i am no man
to take the lie in my teeth without satisfac-
tion

  i am not here to bandy words with you
i replied nor must you forget that it is
i that am asking satisfaction go on with
your story and bring it to an early end

  well then this man pointing to the
form on the couch was my school fellow
he was an orphan but his mothers brother
had taken upon himself the schooling of him
no

adventure

money he had and horses and a man or two
this uncle of his lived in the american colo-
nies and must have been a man of great
wealth to judge by the allowance his neph-
ew had

  now then my friend comes up to lon-
don to live and very shortly the name of
the honorable george brockhurst there he
lies- nodding toward the bed-became
well known as a reckless plunger both at
the tables and with the fair sex in the
midst of this comes a letter to me where i
am biting my nails in hanau saying that
word has come that the uncle is dead and
the honorable george is sole heir and would
i care to make the journey to the colonies
with him to claim his estate

  he was my old schoolfellow and play-
mate you see and moreover he owed me
upward of two thousand pounds that i had
diced from him from time to time i ap-
plied for leave but could get none and hav-
ing no one at home to plead for me i was
like to stay in germany and so lose this gol-
den opportunity

  i had heard that you had so many debt-
ors they would not trust you out of their
sight i interjected

  well perhaps so said he no matter
to continue your worthy doctor had a
system of getting men away but he must
have payment first for the head passage
cull does no business on tick and i had no
money he proposed to me that i join a
mission that was going shortly to england
from the court of young stuart in italy
which mission was to pass through hanau
to have a look at the state of king georges
army

  there being no other way for me to get
to england i agreed at this time he men-
tioned cutting your throat and that matter
was cleared as you know you being so
generous as to make me a loan there was no
need of being a jacobite so i was quit of
them and had no more to do with them

  why then did they pursue you so thirsti-
ly they hunger for your blood my buck

he changed color a bit and
moved about nervously

  ah well they have little rea-
son they provided me with a
passport that took a good fortnight and
much money to get and i did not return
it to them and moreover i had some knowl-
edge of their plans

  and so betrayed them to the norfolk
coast guard

  what would you he cried that i
should let them land in peace and come
whooping into england to cut my throat
and overturn the government how do
you know all this did they give you pas-
sage in my place i warrant you they did by
your sober face well my gallant galloper
your neck is in the shadow of the scaffold if
you came into england in that company
not on your word i retorted there
breathes no man so near to death as the vis-
count of barnet at this minute say on
now

  well there is not much more to say save
that i intended to redeem my bond from
this mans funds and i really had an estate
to secure even if it was in america and not
in england but it is all one now by
your unlucky sword and so i think you
have your revenge of me after all

  but how of betraying me at the inn with

such a-false currish lie as you put upon

me there and moreover when you rode
away so swiftly from me in flanders you
lifted my purse which was poor enough
return for the good i had done you

  i lifted your purse you rave i did
no such thing your purse indeed had
i robbed you would i have come back to
that inn-yard and lifted you on a horse and
put my neck in danger having gotten safely
away once could you not lose it could
not any horse tender or turn spit in the inn
have gone through you while you lay there
like one dead and you put the blame on
me

  well why did you not wait for me at
williamstadt

  i waited man as long as i could i
must to england why this man was on
the eve of sailing as i thought i waited
and when you were a week overdue i took
ship because there was little chance of get-
ting another for some time

  umph i grunted smooth enough
but your words lack the strength of truth
where is my money

  the half that you gave me in hanau i
expended in getting to england i was
again out of money and coming down to
london where the honorable george await-
ed me impatiently so it was that the
unfortunate affair of the inn occurred
wait - holding up his hand for i was stir-
ring impatiently-i lacked funds for
the bold dragoon

hi

clothes and to make the appearance that
would be fitting i had struck up an ac-
quaintance with my honest merchant in
the coach and it was fast ripening into
friendship when the affair of the highway-
man took place was it not an act of provi-
dence it was the one thing i lacked to
settle me firmly with old moneybags to
restore his pilfered gold you see he said
smiling upon me with an open countenance
he would be the more likely to make me a
small loan being in my debt as it were

  and so i was the stepping-stone to favor
with the merchant even though it cost me
my neck

  the viscount laughed a trifle uneasily

  nonsense i would have had you freed
next day i would not have let any harm
come to you as it was when the landlord
awakened the entire inn with shrieking that
you had escaped and stolen his horse it was
i that set them upon the wrong track by
telling them that you would make for the
coast instead of london

  but now he continued it is all at an
end i think we may cry quits indeed i
made you some slight inconvenience but
you have made me much more for i have
now no means of livelihood nor the where-
withal to get me home again

  how am i to know that this is not made
of whole cloth and that you never saw this
man before tonight

  the viscount stepped over to the dead
man and thrusting his hand into his bosom
drew out a leathern portfolio this he put
down upon the chair and taking a handker-
chief from his skirt pocket wiped the blood
from the leather then he opened the port-
folio and drew out a packet of papers bound
with red tape

  he always carried these with him said
the viscount lest they be stolen it seems
he was at some pains to collect them so
that there should be no slip up for he said
that there was not a soul in the colonies that
k lew him and that there must be no doubt
of his identity

  here  continued the viscount taking
out a paper and extending it to me is the
original letter from the agent in london
that the uncle was dead and that george
was the sole heir here is a scroll of the
will the original being in the colonies here
is a scroll of the parish register where george
was bom and a letter from the solicitor to
mr huckins in boston america who is the

custodian of the estate that the bearer
whose signature appears above is the hon-
orable george brockhurst nephew and heir
of matthew tupper gentleman as per the

inclosed papers

  the viscount looked at this last letter
sadly then slowly his eyes began to widen

 why burn my soul in - he cried

there is no signature at the top the hon-
orable george hath not signed his name in
the place provided

  he sat a moment in deep thought while
i nodded my head and yearned for sleep
for my windows were graying with the com-
ing dawn suddenly the viscount looked
me fixedly in the face

  who is to know cried he but what i
am the honorable george brockhurst
heres the proof and i can sign my name
there and he waved the agents letter un-
der my nose come will you go to ameri-
ca with me and be my companion if i win
this estate the half of it shall be yours
there is not that a recompense is not
that proof that i am your friend it will
make you rich for life

  the memory of what followed is some-
what dim to me i was beside myself with
fatigue and would have no further discus-
sion of the matter until i had had some
sleep so telling the viscount to make him-
self comfortable on the floor i went outside
on the landing and locked him in

  i knew he would not steal away for as
long as i was alive i would be in possession
of his secret and have the means of ruining
his project but i had no desire to sleep in
the same room with him for i felt that he
was not above slitting my throat with my
own sword directly as i was asleep

  i awakened later in the morning when the
wench who took care of the lodgings came
to make up the bed i sent her about her
business and she went nothing loath to get
out of some work then i aroused the vis-
count and we discussed the matter again
finally i told him he must keep watch by
the body until nightfall and that none must
enter the room and that upon my return he
should have his answer

  i went to the inn where dashbaughs
party were billeted to see what he might
have to offer in the way of suggestion for a
livelihood but he was abroad and no one
knew when he would return i found that
i had but one shilling left and my lodging
to pay on the morrow so i decided that i


adventure

had best go to the devil in temple bar and
have a bit to eat for i had not broken my
fast since the day before

  go to the- indeed i thought a

very happy jest

  as i went in i glanced up at the sign
which is that of the devil pulling st dun-
stans nose-the church of st dunstan be-
ing opposite-and i thought that that was
the way of it everywhere that wrong tri-
umphed and honor was made a mock of

  so since i had no money and would be in
the street tomorrow without a roof to cover
me and no prospect of honorable employ-
ment i decided that i would go to america
with the viscount for the food and shelter it
would give me iput as for the estate i would
have none of it i knew him now for what
he was and would have my eye upon him
he that would cry out upon me at this let
him be alone and friendless in a great city
with winter coming on and see how long his
moral courage will hold out

when i had come back to my
garret i found the door open and
the viscount gone and with him
the body of the dead man there
was no blood upon the bed beyond a few
spots here and there but there was a deal
upon the floor and this i made shift to
clean up with an old shirt while i was
about this matter there was a great clatter-
ing up the stair and the viscount rushed in

  ha he cried we are in luck indeed
well and what is your answer noble dra-
goon

  who is to pay the expense of this ven-
ture

  why that we must discover said he
wrinkling his brow but i have two or three
ways that it may be done that indeed is
the slightest trouble passage has already
been engaged and paid for by the honorable
georges agent to whom i am known thank
god it remains to keep him away from us
till the ship sails the captain of the vessel
but knows that thehonorable georgebrock-
hurst and a companion are to sail with him
and if i can find out the name of the ship
and where she lies we may foil the agent in
some manner

  where is the body

  neatly done cried the viscount a
neat trick if i do say so i stepped out
some time since to have a dram to steady
my nerves who should i meet but an old

acquaintance of mine a student of surgery
i whispered him that i knew of a good sub-
ject and he dragging me to a nearby tap
where there were three or four more of his
persuasion they made up a purse between
them and very shortly came with a hamper
and cart and relieved us of the honorable
george and we are now five pounds the
richer here- and he tendered me some
coins-here is your share for we are to go
half and half in every thing

  i thank you for your generous offer-
i was really quite smitten to the heart by
it-but i will have no blood money a
moment ago you were sobbing that i killed
your best friend and now you sell his corpse
to a body-snatcher

  as you please he said whistling he
is dead and we might as well have some
profit by his demise the slavey here had
her eye to a crack of the door when we were
taking him out but i gave her a kiss and
a crown so we need fear nothing on that
score but come let us out of this hole
for i have a pleasanter place in pall mall
where i lived with the late lamented so let
us begone to it

  as we went down the stairs he objected
to the picinino saying that i would draw
attention to us wearing that great sword of
french make about but i told him that
there was no way of concealing it and that

i	would not go without it so he held his
peace

  that night we lay in the honorable
george brockhursts lodgings in st albans
street the next day the viscount was up
betimes and cried that it would be a busy
day it seems that the honorable george
had been planning to sail within the week

  now then i asked the viscount did
he imperil his liberty and even his life by
running about the streets with all that ri-
bald crew

  it was a little farewell said the vis-
count brockhurst and i had been to the
red lion in chick lane and were coming
home very friendly when we met some men
at the head of fetter lane with whom the
honorable george had acquaintance we
had a rouse or two in one of the taverns and
then the company suggested that we break
a few lanthorns and give the sweat to an
apprentice or two to teach them to stay
indoors at unseemly hours

  the sweat you know he continued
looking at me from the corner of his eye is
the bold dragoon



given by surrounding the victim and prick-
ing him in that part of his body that pre-
sents the best target naturally he will
turn away from the sword point thus pre-
senting the target to another member of the
circle

   i dare say it is a very delightful thing to
undergo but will not these gay companions
make some inquiry regarding the honorable
georges fate

  not they there would be too much
explaining of their own part in the nights
doings required and then they ran away
when brockhurst was struck down which
would be a hard thing to tell about

  we were somewhat concerned with an
outfit for me since the viscount wanted the
honorable georges clothes for himself and
he had no extras of his own i possessed
the clothes i stood up in and a change of
linen but finally we found an old one of the
honorable georges that fitted me none too
well and with that i had to be content

  why then cried the viscount the
name of our ship is the gull and we must be
about finding her or we are unmade

  so we set forth and asked the watermen
about whitehall stairs if they knew of the
gull

  that i do your washups howled one
she lies at redriff i knows er a liddle
ship she be for the colonies

  thats the one said the viscount and
after some haggling about the fare for the
waterman said it was a longish pull we took
into the boat and were rowed to where the
gull lay

         the gull was as the waterman
j had said a liddle ship scarce
larger than the lugger that had
mwls brought me from france she
had a castle on the after part of her and an-
other one not so high on the fore but she
seemed a small craft to brave the voyage to
the americas however upon the water-
mans crying out some men with seamens
caps on their heads looked over the rail and
presently let down a ladder to us by which
we went into the ship

   after we had stood for some time sniffing
the fearful stench of tar and rope grease and
other noisome things a man came to us
from where they were nailing the covers on
the holes in the deck through which the
cargo is stored and civilly inquired our
business

  i am the honorable george brockhurst
said the viscount and have engaged pas-
sage to the americas in this vessel

   oh yes said the sailor making a curi-
ous motion with his knuckle at his forelock
would you care to see your berths

  we would said the viscount

  is your baggage in the boat

  baggage in the boat why no did
you expect us to bring our baggage now

  it were best that you bring it aboard
today and come yourselves sirs for we ex-
pect to be dropping down river this time to-
morrow

  the viscount was considerably taken
aback at this but he recovered and direc-
ted the sailor to show us our berths these
proved to be two shelves one above the
other in a damp dark room under the after
part of the ship

   are you certain that these are the right
ones asked the viscount wrinkling his
nose at the evil smell of the place

  aye said the sailor for here is the
name chalked on the door and he showed
us the name of brockhurst with a figure

	beneath it on the narrow door

  enough said the viscount let us
make what speed we may to st albans
street and have our baggage on board

  so we went over the side again and back
up the river the viscount saying never a
word but chewing his fingers all the way
so i could see that he was upset in mind

  there was dirt planned to be done some
one the viscount announced when we were
back in the room once more for i did not
know that we were to sail for a week yet i
had no outfit for this venture whatsoever
i can now use brockhursts but we will have
no time to supply you with one have you
any money at all

   not a groat i replied sadly enough
here the viscount fell to chewing his fin-
gers again and beat his brow

  did not the dead man have some money
here

  why to be sure cried the viscount
leaping up he discharged his man ser-
vant the day before yesterday and he paid
him his wages in this very room he kept
the money in here

  he crossed the room to a small desk
or secretary that stood there through the
drawers and cabinets of which he went like
a terrior after a bone he turned about
with a rather white face
ii

adventure

  thereis no money there he said it
must be somewhere he would not go on a
journey like this without money

  perhaps he intended to get an advance
from the agent perhaps he carried it about
with him did you search his clothes be-
fore they took him away

  the viscount gave a loud shriek when i
had finished and began to curse and to
swear in a manner such as i had rarely
heard even in the army

  to be sure he said at last he had it
on him and i never thought to go through
him you were there why didnt you
search his pockets

  i am not in the habit of robbing the men
i kill i answered

  the viscount turned to me in one of those
sudden changes of character that i was to
marvel at during the coming months

  listen said he you be- if you

are going in with me to steal an estate from
a man you have murdered let us have none
of this sanctimonious attitude of yours i
picked you out of the gutter and am in a
fair way to make you rich for life so i want
no turning up of noses if you are with me
in this well and good if not there is the
door and you may pack yourself off at once
i had to laugh

  good enough i said good enough
i was wrong i can see that you and i will
get on famously after this i make no
more comments

  the viscount however was back in his
former mood tugging at his hair and wring-
ing his hands

  i have it he cried at last wait for
me here cord up some of this luggage
will you ill be back before dark and then
we can go to the mermaid and have some
supper and so to the ship

  then he clapped his hat on his head and
went out

  he had been gone about an hour and i
had corded up two chests and was at work
on a third when the door which had been
unlocked opened suddenly and a woman
entered without so much as by your
leave she had on a dress of some coarse
gray stuff and a mob cap from under which
her black hair escaped in waving strands
she had a very hard countenance upon
which there were traces of ancient beauty
her fingers were heavily jeweled and so
were her ears and she had a fan of feathers
in her hand

  so she began after a long silence i
thought as much and so my gallant gentle-
man had been skulking off these last two or
three days and thinks he will get safely
away with a quarters rent in his pocket i
will not leave for a fortnight says he and
in two days he is gone and his baggage cord-
ed up and who might you be she asked
peering sharply at me

  i am mr brockhursts companion i
told her i nearly said the viscount bar-
nets but checked myself in time

  oh you are i see you are not above
wearing his old clothes referring to the
suit i had on which was indeed one of the
honorable georges old ones i made her
no reply

  will your master be back shortly she
asked after a while

  i do not know i replied

  well she remarked do you know
where he is

  no i answered roughly enough and
went on with cording the chest

  i shall wait for his return she decided
i have a crow to pick with him and it may
as well be done now as any time i have
not kept these lodgings for ten years without
meeting a few of his kidney i will have my
rent do you hear

  i paid no attention and the woman began
to move about the room

  look she cried at my fine bed all
chipped and scarred

  the honorable george had indeed broken
the footboard badly probably by lying
down on the bed and catching the heel of
his boot on it to draw the boot off his leg
i suppose he had thrown his bootjack at
his servant and was too drunk to look for it
again

  see this table where they have left their
dirty liquor and never offered me so much as
the smell of the cork and tobacco on my
rugs i tell you fifty pound would not re-
pay the damage to this room look at
that

  she pointed to where some one had dug
the wall with a sword probably in illustra-
ting the story of a street brawl or in doing
exercise

  and does he think he will get away with-
out paying my score does he ill have
it out of that ugly face of his first

  and she hooked her fingers most threaten-
ingly after a while she began another as-
sault this time by wheedling me
the bold dragoon



  tell me lad she began presently
does he keep any of his money in the
room in that desk perhaps and she
leered at me

  you may look for all of me i told her
knowing full well that there was none there

  she proceeded at once to hunt the drawers
but found nothing other than some scented
notes which she sniffed at and then read
with every appearance of a lively interest
then she came back and tried again

  do you think she began sitting on the
chest which i had uncorded and corded a
dozen times for something to do that your
master will be back before supper

  i have no idea i replied and leaving
her went over to the window she followed
at once and coming closely up to me asked
softly you are not accustomed to the com-
pany of a lady such as i am or you would
be more civil

  no said i turning away from the
heavy scent she had upon her i have not
been in shoreditch these three years

  fool that i was to bait a woman of her
type she gave a wild shriek and the fire
flew from her eyes

  -you she cried you baboons

foundling ill kill you for that

  and she was upon me clawing and spit-
ting like a cat so that i was forced to put her
out the door and a hard enough time i had
doing it once she was in the passage she
fell to kicking the panels and screeching
more oaths than one would hear in a
long days walk through the darkest parts
of london finally she went downstairs
and i heard the bang of the street door
after her

i was breathing easily again
when the viscount returned and
hammered on the locked door
why the bolting and bar-
ring he inquired

   i told him of my caller

  oh that was nell he said in disgust
she was a famous beauty once and some
lord gave her this house and set her up as a
lodging house keeper to salve his conscience
and keep her quiet concerning a love affair
of theirs

  then he began again

  i had an idea that that was the reason
for brockhurst telling every one we would
not sail for a sennight he was to beat his
quarters rent and-knows how many

tradesmens bills by nipping out without
saying a word to any one there is indeed
no time to lose you fool to insult her like
that she has probably gone for the bai-
liffs and if we do not haste out of here we
are likely to come no nearer our ship than
the fleet here he laughed at his own
joke i doubt not that brockhurst owed
every tailor and wig-maker in london now
then with tjiose chests i have a man below
with a cart to carry them to the stairs

  but before we could so much as raise one
chest from the floor we heard a womans
step on the stair and the door slammed open
and banged against the wall

  i looked up prepared to meet the lady
nell once more but instead beheld a vision
of loveliness that quite took my breath
away here was a dainty maid perhaps
eighteen with a profusion of golden curls
and eyes of such a blue as took the
breath men of the mounted forces are
more appreciative of beauty in women i
think being accustomed to the appraising
of horses by their appearance and here was
as fine a young filly as one could want with
a conformation that defied comparison

  why maud burkie cried the viscount
what are you doing here and if that
isnt doris come in doris dear

  the vision came in her nose in the air
followed by a gigantic female with shoulders
like the trunnions of a gun and mustaches
that would do credit to a grenadier

  ye needna dear me muttered the
grenadier woman for i ha known you
ower long for the wastrel ye are

  i might ask what you are doing here
my dear viscount said the blue-eyed lady

  why i am-or have been-living with
the honorable george and this gentle-
man- nodding at me-is hugh ban-
croft a friend of mine whom i crave leave
to present miss maud burkie

  she acknowledged the introduction with
a scarcely perceptible curtsy but smiled at
me very winningly

  you have made a small mistake she
said to the viscount still showing her white
teeth i am not miss maud burkie any
longer but have taken another name
indeed cried the viscount pray ac-
cept my most heartfelt wishes for all the
happiness this world affords and who
might the lucky man be

  ah said the lady i hesitate to tell
you for i fear you will be angry
ii

adventure

  not i exclaimed the viscount i lost
all hopes of you years ago

  it is not that pouted the blue-eyed one
but i fear that the news will put you to
some inconvenience

  well lets have it anyway

  i would have you know said the lady
casting her eyes to the ground that i have
been married to the honorable george these
seven months and that my name is not miss
burkie but mrs brockhurst

  the clock ticked wheels rattled from the
street and the cry of a man selling brooms
came faintly to us doris shifted her weight
and i jumped at the creaking of the boards

  oh this is a- mess a confounded

mess o god moaned the viscount your
husband never said anything to me of this
marriage

  it was a secret affair said she and i
was to join him in london when he had
found a home and then we were to make it
known but i was lonely and impatient
and so came without waiting for a sum-
mons when do you expect my husband
the viscount looked at me but i had no
help for him i think the lady had some
idea of the truth at that for she grew very
white

  tell me she cried is anything amiss
  no said the viscount

  is my husband ill

  he is dead i cried and could have bit-
ten off my tongue

  the lady shrieked and doris leaped to her
side and cursed me most heartily in her
scotch tongue like a true grenadier

  where is he buried cried the lady

  he was drowned blurted the viscount
a boat was overset and his body was never
found

  the facile liar

  at that the poor girl wilted like a rose in
the heat and doris bore her away and in
a short time we heard a coach departing

  let us hurry in--s name cried the

viscount for she will be back and want the

details and the-will be to pay i come

of a border family he moaned and with
trying to sit on two stools since the days of
bruce they have many times fallen between
them but i doubt if any member of my
house has been cursed with ill luck equal to
mine

  there he panted now lets be quick
with these chests and once we are on ship-
board we can laugh at them all

  we picked up the chest and hurried it
downstairs to where a man was waiting
with a barrow there were three of the
chests and when we were on the stairs with
the last one there was a noise of voices at
the door and a womans over all of them

  its nell said the viscount sadly
now the fat is in the fire well lets
face her down

mit was indeed nell the woman
that had cursed me through the
door had lost no time in her mov-
ments she had with her two great
hulking men armed with knotty clubs and
she urged them in shrill tones to do their duty

  seize them she cried thats him
hed do an honest woman out of a quarters
rent grab him catch hold there theres
law in england yet

  there was quite a crowd of idlers boys
and serving men and all manner of hobble-
dehoys gathered about and nell began to
harangue these concerning her wrongs to
their great delight one of the bailiffs
stepped up to the viscount and civilly
enough inquired if he were the honorable
george brockhurst

  no indeed replied the viscount i
am the viscount of barnet and this is my
companion captain bancroft this ex-
cellent lady is mistaken in our identity
the bailiff fell back and begged his par-
don raying that he had an order for the de-
livery of the body of one george brockhurst
to the governor of the fleet prison the
viscount looked so lofty and unconcerned
smiling a little and resting his hand upon a
walking stick he had acquired with the fine
suit he wore that i thought he would awe
them down and we should get safely away
but as he raised his hand in a signal to the
man to proceed with the cart i noticed a
sour-faced man shoving his way through
the crowd

  hold all cried this one bailiff seize
this man

  i am not mr brockhurst said the vis-
count smiling

  thats as it may be answered the sour-
faced man but i made that suit and i have
not yet been paid for it nor for this one
either pointing to me seize them both
aye cried nell have at them
they owe me for a quarters rent ho
thieves thieves the crowd cheered her
thunderously
the bold dragoon



  you shall smart for this declared the
viscount to the sour-faced man

  i dare say was the reply mean-
while have them to the fleet both of them
and that cartload of clothes to my house

  the sour-faced man produced a bundle of
writs after he had spoken and handed them
to one of the bailiffs this one directed the
driver to go somewhere with our chests and
then taking the viscount by the arm
started off with him leaving his companion
to follow with me

  the one that had the viscount required
his sword of him upon which the man that
was with me asked me for mine and i had to
yield up the picinino to him this seemed
to produce a strange effect upon the crowd
who saw the sword plainly for the first time
and divers of them remarked upon its pat-
tern then after a time they stopped
their jeering and numbers of them took
themselves off up alleys and down lanes
at the top of their speed

  the officers were taking us by the back
streets to escape as much attention as pos-
sible but the crowd about us kept growing
larger and by the time we were come to
the back of covent garden it bid fair to
be a mob then it was that i had some ink-
ling of the reason for all this excitement
which could not be caused by seeing two
debtors hauled to jail

  there was a man running about from one
to another pointing calling and waving his
hand i saw his face once or twice and knew
him it was the leader of the jacobite
party who had come with me to england
i knew his purpose too he would have
both me and the viscount slain and so have
revenge on the one and be rid of the other
the crowd responded to his efforts

  the one beind they cried pointing
 vs a ard looker e is lookits scots
sword

  aye belike es a wild tghland man

  long life to king george howled some
of them and be-to all jacobites

  the crowd snarled its approval and a
cloud of filth and vegetables flew through
the air the two bailiffs halted and con-
ferred

  we should ha brought a coach said
one of them and all this would ha been
missed

  they debated about going into an inn
and sending for help for the mob was be-
coming more and more menacing and was

commencing to bay in a most threatening
manner they firmly believed by now that
we were jacobites or french spies or as-
sassins of some kind and they thirsted for
our blood

  just at the moment when the mob was
packed closest about us and we could see
their dirty snarling faces and smell the reek
of the kennel and the stews and ditches
where they denned upon them the vis-
count thrust his hand into his pocket and
after a moment brought it out again

  catch he cried and flung a handful of
coins in the air

  there was one tremendous roar from the
mob a host of dirty hands were thrust in
air and then a wild scrambling began on the
stones all else forgotten at the sight of a
little gold i grasped the stratagem at once
nor needed the viscounts shout to spur me
to action the man that held me was over-
thrown and he and i fell to the pavement
together but i was up the first and wrench-
ing my sword from his hands was deep in
the crowd before he was off his back

  i thought i should never get clear of
them for they were all fighting their way to
the center roaring and striking with their
fists and paying me not the slightest heed
finally i won through and having got clear
of the skirts of the crowd found the vis-
count and we both set off down the first
street at the best speed we could muster

  when the roar of the riot had grown faint
behind us we slowed to a walk twisting and
turning to throw off pursuit people
glanced at us in curiosity for the viscount
was very torn and battered and i doubt
not but what i was in worse case but none
hindered us and finally we came to the river
just at dusk and secured a boat to go down
to the gull

chapter vii

of how we put forth to sea again

f i he night came on with a thick fog so
that when we were come aboard none
noticed our tattered condition we went at
once into our berths and then the viscount
sat him down on the sleeping shelf and cov-
ered his face with his hands

  if ever he moaned there was a more
ill-omened venture i do not know of it
here we are for sea our baggage lost our
clothes torn and the hounds upon our trail
i tell you that confounded meat-ax of yours
n

adventure

will have you hanged yet and you must
needs go out of your way to make an enemy
of nell so that she has the bailiffs about our
ears and sends off a boy to tell the tailors we
are breaking cover

   if you he cold all across the ocean you
will have only yourself to thank for if it
had not been for your folly we would not
have lost our baggage and all our bed cov-
ering oh curse and confound and crush
me he moaned i come of an ill-starred
house and should expect no luck in this
world

  we are at liberty though and not in a
debtors prison i reminded him

  nor are we out of the harbor yet i
might mention that we are somewhat poorer
than when we left the house and god he
knows that we were poor enough then i do
not know how much i threw to that dirty
rabble but it was more than i could afford
i warrant you that

   our passage is paid for

  to what end to land us penniless in
an unknown land full of woods and wild
savages

   but there will be an estate to furnish us
with food and what other things we need
why so there will i had never thought
of that indeed i had forgotten it for the
moment why so indeed come he cried
all cheer and smiles once more things are
not so bad after all cheer up man

  since i was the only one who had been
cheerful up to now i thought he need not
have made this last remark by way of re-
buke i mentioned the widow brockhurst

  aha he laughed never fret about
her i know her of old her husband is
dead her little romance is over and she
will fly away back to the north again and
marry some other idiot and so that fond
fool married little maud he certainly
pulled the wool over all our eyes god be
praised she came not a sennight sooner
he sat down again on the sleeping shelf
now then touching our financial mat-
ters yesterday i went to see our friend
the merchant whom you will remember-
here he glanced under his lashes at me with
a very impudent smirk-we had some busi-
ness with about a fortnight since he re-
membered me had me into his counting
house gave me a glass of very excellent
wine and rang for his man to throw an-
other stick on the fire

  i reminded him of what i had told him

on the journey for i had given him a full
account of where i was going and for what
purpose save that at that time i expected to
be the honorable brockhursts companion
and not the honorable brockhurst himself
he said that he remembered and inquired
as to the honorables state of health which
you may be sure i did not tell truth-
fully then i made the suggestion that he
advance me a trifle solomons wives i
could feel the ice freeze

   he inquired why i do not apply to the
honorable george or to his agent or why i
did not bring sufficient funds for a voyage to
america where the greater part of the peo-
ple go naked all the time to all this i had
no answer of course and he thereupon rang
for his man again not to throw a stick on
the fire but to throw me out so i took my
departure

   i did though fire one parting shot i
told him that if i caught him on the heath
again that i would have his heart of him
i think it was a hit for he changed color
so we must battle our way across the win-
try sea with nothing but the remnant of our
income from the honorable georges corpse
to keep us until we come into our estate

   i was awakened in the morning by mens
voices and a bumping against the side the
sun was up and reflected from the river on
the roof of the berth with a quivering shim-
mering light running about like a will-o-
the-wisp i listened and found to my hor-
ror that there was a boat under the windows
of the berth and men in her talking with
others on the deck

   so you are sure they are not aboard
asked some one in the boat make no mis-
take my man the giving of shelter to trai-
tors is a hanging offense

   un be not abooard i tell e cried some
one on the deck let red breast coom
abooard ill warrant well show un soon
enough

   there was a sound of laughter from sev-
eral throats at this and a chorus of cheery
invitations to coom oop accompanied
by a scattered thumping by which i was
led to believe that those on deck had clubs
or staves and were pounding the rail with
them

   i looked at the shelf where the viscount
slept and discovered him wide awake with
beads of sweat upon his brow he made me
a sign to be silent and we listened a while
longer to those in the boat threatening and
the bold dragoon



those on deck jeering and finally we heard
the rattle of oars put out again and the
thump and creak of them as the boat was
rowed away

  the viscount was very gray about the
chops

  they are hunting us he said with dry
lips they must have soldiers after us
too did you hear him mention traitors

  there is nothing to fear i assured him
i am no traitor and the possession of a
french sword does not make me one its
an italian sword by rights anyway i still
have my papers too

  now all the time of our arrest and during
and afterthe riot i had kept my dragoons
valise which i had worn about my shoul-
ders by a strap it was so obviously a piece
of personal property and of little value
being all chipped and cut with the usage of
the campaigns that the bailiffs had not
troubled themselves to take it from me in
it was my discharge and one or two letters
that certain officers had seen fit to write
from time to time regarding services that i
had performed during the campaign if
any one thought me a traitor he had but
to read me these letters

  there came a rap at the door i reached
out and took hold of the picinino and the
viscount thrust his hand under his mat-
tress where he had a pistol

  come in he called

  the door opened and a bearded man with
very bright blue eyes entered

  good morning to you sirs he said i
would advise you to he quiet today and for
so long as we shall be in the river some
friends of yours were inquiring for you al-
ready

  but really i said we are innocent of
the offense with which we are charged it
is not us they are after-

  a quick change flashed across the bearded
mans face a momentary brightening like a
glimpse of the sun through winters clouds

  i ask no man his business he said peer-
ing at me under his heavy brows my
owners tell me that passage is paid for such
a one i will carry him to his port if my ship
fives there may be a great to-do on land
but at sea the wind blows and calm falls and
the tempest roars whether stuart or han-
over catholic or protestant sits on the
throne when passengers come aboard
with swords like that- pointing to the
picinino-and no baggage and their

clothes showing signs of recent conflict i
advise them to stay below decks even if
boats full of officers have not been scouring
the river since sun-up

  who are they seeking asked the vis-
count

  a french spy and a certain scotch vis-
count who incited a crowd to riot and
mobbed two of his majestys officers in the
city yesterday

  are we sailing today i asked

  no we expected to but there was a
new consignment of goods so we have had
the hatches off and will be here for two or
three more days lay low and you will have
no trouble i should think that once they
discovered you had taken ship for the col-
onies they would trouble you no longer

  he bade us good day after that and went
out

  aye said the viscount if we were
spies and traitors they would let us be but
since we are only poor debtors they raise
the hue and cry all up and down the
thames

for three days we lay at our
anchor waiting i suppose for
the new goods but they never
came it was perishing cold for
the window of the berth had no glass but
was closed by a heavy wooden shutter
when the shutter was open the wind came
in and froze us and when it was closed the
fearful smell of the place was like to suffo-
cate us we had sent ashore for some bed
covering and the master had given us an
old boat cloak and a moth - eaten greatcoat
he had and under these we lay and shiv-
ered

  we durst not go on deck except after
nightfall so during the day we lay on our
shelves and shivered it was more like a
jail than anything i could imagine sev-
eral times boats came to the ships side and
once people got out of them on deck and
went into the great cabin where we could
hear them talking the ship masters voice
heavy and respectful and some other per-
sons the tones of which we could scarce
hear

  the drearinessof those three days i shall
never forget nor the cold nor the wet dark-
ness of that hole in the bottom of the ship
where we lay i think it was at this time
that i began to dislike the viscount

  on the morning of the fourth day there


adventure

was a great running about overhead and a
deal of shouting and singing there was a
rustling whimpering noise along the ships
side and i leaped out of bed and opened the
shutter it was not yet day but there was
the first gray of daylight and a cold mist
lay upon the water we had set sail at last
and were slipping down the river with the
the tide

  later in the morning when we were well
away from the city and there was but little
shipping the viscount and i went out to the
deck the sun was bright and warm the
clear cold air blew in our faces and our
hearts leaped like those of uncaged birds
on either side of the river the fields stretched
away brown with the color of late autumn
we could see cottages and inns and the great
houses of the gentry set back among the
trees of their parks and the little roads like
threads across the hills with carts on them
and maids waving their hands

  i turned to call the viscounts attention
to something i have forgotten now what it
was when i beheld him staring with slack
jaw at something i could not see i stepped
to one side so that i could see beyond the
mast and beheld two females coming out of
the great cabin

  they were both wrapped in shawls so
that the identity of the smaller one would be
hard to guess but there was no mistaking
the gigantic form of the second it was the
grenadier and there was little doubt that
the other was the widow brockhurst
then the smaller one turned her face in our
direction and we could see it was indeed she
when she perceived us and could recognize
us under the outrageous garments that we
wore she came running toward us with a
happy cry

  oh wonderful she cried what happy
chance has brought you on this ship are
you indeed going to the americas what
good fortune is mine now i will not have
to make that long long voyage alone and
arrive friendless in a strange land

  indeed madam said the viscount
sourly and what takes you to america

  she cast down her eyes at this and put her
handkerchief to them

  now that my husband is dead she
said with a catch in her speech i have
nowhere to go no friends nor any means of
livelihood i purpose to go to my poor dead
husbands uncle who dear george said was
a very wealthy man and see if he will not

make some provision for me in his house-
hold

  there was a silence after this and the
masts creaked and ropes beat upon the sails
and men in the forward part of the ship sang
at their work the viscount looked at me
and i at him and finally he turned without
a word and went down into the berth 

  why what is wrong with him asked
mrs brockhurst with her eyes wide with
concern

  perhaps a touch of the sea i said
he had complained of it before

  indeed the motion of the ship is very
unsettling said she tell me she asked
turning toward the rail do you know the
names of any of these villages we are pass-
ing

  then we stepped to the vessels side and
stayed in conversation for some little time
after which she took her departure and
went back into the cabin

  now i am no sailor when we were come
out into the channel and felt the heave and
pitch of the great waves i became grievously
ill and for a long time i lay helpless and
prayed for death the viscount was in lit-
tle better case and lay groaning on his shelf
all day long

  when i was a little recovered i struggled
on deck and would lie for a while looking
out over that great waste of waters or up
at the bellying sails and wishing that i had
never left england there is no pleasure
in a journey by sea there is nothing to be
seen day after day but the heaving billows
rolling and rolling from one horizon to the
other and the wide lonely sea like a great
moorf and the tiny ship in the midst of it
sailing into the suns eye

  our berth was cold and wet and foul
with the sound of the water rushing along
the sides tapping and muttering and whin-
ing like a dog at a house door yearning to
come in the sea is a pitiless thing cold
and gray and what there is to bring men to
seek their living upon it and brave the
beasts that dwell under it and the robbers
that scour the top of it i can not see

  we had been at sea the tenth day and i
had had some talk with the widow brock-
hurst now and again when we would meet
upon the deck the after part of the ship
was high and stairs went up from the waist
to a platform or smaller deck upon which
the great cabin opened from this platform
there were yet more stairs that went to the
the bold dragoon



poop or after deck where the helmsman
stood and the master of the ship walked
our berth was under the platform and we
went into it by a door under the stairs that
went up from the waist

  now the widow brockhurst lived in the
great cabin and we could tell when she came
forth by hearing her step above our heads
at such times i found myself hurriedly get-
ting up from my mattress and making haste
to go out on deck

  dining the course of our acquaintance
the guardsman always standing by the
widow informed me that she had been at her
wits end when she found that her husband
was dead and that she had not known which
way to turn she had decided then to go to
the colonies and upon her applying to mer-
chants who did business in the americas
she had found that there was a ship sailing
that very next day

  she had gotten together all her money
pawned what little jewelry she had made
application to some of her friends and so
raised money for the passage she it was
who had come aboard during the last day
that we had heard talking with the master
of the ship

         one night i had come up to have
a breath of air before going to
bed and was greatly surprized to
find the widow alone there was
a kind of bench that ran along the side of
the ship just beyond the door of the house
and she was seated upon this wrapped in
a cloak i went up to her and made some
commonplace remarks and she made room
for me on the bench

  doris is ill she said and has taken to
her bed but i could not sleep and came out
to look upon the stars awhile

  indeed it was a beautiful night with a
great number of stars glittering in the cold
sky and a full moon that danced its light
upon the heaving sea the sails bellied
above us and the wind made soft music in
the rigging like distant violins of a truth
it was a night to upset steadier minds than
mine

  we sat for some time in silence so close
that i could feel the warmth of her and
her hair blew across my cheek the kettle
drums began to pound in my breast and
the trumpets to sound in my ear like the
stir of a camp awakening i was minded
of a night like this in germany when

dashbaugh and i had walked up and down

the camp looking across the plains at the
enemys fires and harkening to the sentinels
calling the hour and the horses stamping
at their tethers something of this i must
have said aloud for suddenly she turned to
me

  you were a soldier were you not she
breathed softly i might have known by
your bearing tell me about it wont you
please

  i told her modestly enough that i had
done some campaigning and had been
wounded at dettingen

  oh were you at dettingen she cried
how well i remember that victory how
the beacons blazed and the bells rang at the
news of it and you were there here
she leaned against my shoulder in concern
were you hurt badly

  i perforce told her all about the battle of
our bickerings with the austrians of the
ditch and the morass and of how the day
went against us until our king putting him-
self at the head of the army led us upon the
french with renewed vigor so that the for-
tunes of the day were ours

  we sat there far into the night and then
i went down to my berth with the trumpets
playing in my ears and lay for a long time
while i thought over again the events of the
night finally i went to sleep with the
lightest heart i had had for many a long day
what an ass a man will make of himself if
a woman will but give him half a chance

  after that the voyage was much pleas-
anter during the day the gigantic doris
was on deck but she kept to her bed after
dark so that i had no obstacles in my head-
long rush to destruction it was the vis-
count who offered the first check ever
since the widow had come aboard he had
kept to himself scarce speaking to me at
all and spending what little time he was
above decks in the forepart of the ship
looking out over the sea and chewing his
fingers

  there came then a raw cold day with a
very gray sky and a black hurrying sea
beneath it the motion of the ship was so
severe that it was impossible to stand up-
right on the deck so both the viscount and
i remained in our berth we had nothing to
say to each other for a long time and at last
the viscount rolled his eyes to me from
where he lay on his shelf

  did it ever occur to you said he sourly


adventure

that it was your hand that made mrs
brockhurst a widow

  now there was a ships lanthorn hung to
a beam in the center of the berth and this
was all the light we had the shutter being
closed against the leaping seas this light
swung back and forth with the motion of
the ship so that one moment our faces
would be in the light and the next in shadow
the viscount spoke while my face was in
the light but the ship had swung the other
way and it was in shadow before he had
done and he could not see if he had touched
me on the raw or not

  well what of that i asked him
nothing i but wondered if you ever
thought of it when you were hanging about
her with a face like a sick sheep

  youre not jealous are you i asked
him pleasantly whereat he ground his teeth
and i could see his face work as the light
swung

  listen said he my bold dragoon
do not forget that we go to seize the estate
of one george brockhurst and that i am he
this woman is george brockhursts widow
after the same estate one of us is doomed
to be disappointed and i do not intend
that it shah be i

  i am not interested i said but i am
a little curious to know how you can keep
her from the estate if she has her marriage
lines to show

  what do you suppose i have been think-
ing of all these long days that i have spent
on this accursed ship while you played the
squire of dames the thing is simple i

am the honorable george brockhurst and
have the letters to prove it if she has her
lines with her which i doubt then i can but
swear they are false if she hath not her
lines then i will have an easy task

  ah but she has them said i and
more than that she has a number of letters
from the honorable george she told me
as much she has brought them to show
the rich uncle

  have you ever given thought to the fact
that my merry brockhurst never said a
word to me of his marriage nor had he told
this maud woman that he intended going
to the colonies how does it look either
they were not married or the honorable
george intended to desert her which last i
think the most likely she probably got
wind of it and so came to london

  that hound i muttered i think
after all that i did a good deed by ridding
the earth of him as to what you say of
making mrs brockhurst a widow i think i
did her a favor if she wants the estate
let her have it we will have had our pas-
sage paid to a new land where we may
make a fresh start

  no he roared by the head of john

no she shall not have it - my soul

no

  then he chewed his fingers a while and
muttered to himself finally i noticed his
eyes glittering as the lanthorn swung to and
fro

  one death got me this estate he said
through his teeth another may keep it
for me

the old saloon

       by bill adams

 j seem to see the old saloon

    the sawdust on the floor

 to hear the twanging fiddles tune

 and theres a cold and yellow moon a shining on the door

  i

  

 i hear old voices of the dead
 who gather at the bar

 the tones of those who perished
 upon the seas afar-

 it is the hand of such a one that holds the door ajar

 he says im signing on once more
 to take a trip to sea

 im tired of the sights ashore

 as tired as can be

 ill take a parting drink with you and you take one with me

 and everybody turns around

 and every eye is bright

 they are the ghosts of many drowned
 who gather here at night

 to bide about the dock a while and go before the light

 i	loved the old dockside saloon
 with sawdust on the floor

 where often in the fiddles tune
 a hand would push the door

 while some old shipmate that i knew
 would smile and beckon me-

 a hookers signing on her crew-lets take a trip to sea

t was all old marcel perrots
fault anyway he had no busi-
ness to pry into the future the
church forbids it common sen se
itself demanded that such things be let
alone but then old marcel was not like the
other cajuns of that part of louisiana he
had ideas of his own

  to begin with he did not rush into mar-
riage in his teens true he finally chose a
young wife but this was not until he had
reached middle age and then when the
wife died at the birth of his son he refused
to marry again

  such things were not done on the prairie
wives were like horses one could not get
on without them

  as a matter of fact old marcel was too
shocked to think of risking a second bride
he had planned carefully building his life
upon the solid foundation of experience
his wife had been young and strong yet
for all this in less than a year he was alone
again it was something to think about
sorely perplexed old marcel bent his efforts
to the successful raising of his son even
then all might have been well but for the in-
tervention of pere carbon

  pere carbon was a fisherman who peddled
his wares between the edge of the sea marsh
and the town of st pierre gnarled
weather-beaten receiving tales but never
bearing them he had become the confi-

dant of those who dwelt upon the prairie

  thus when next old marcel encountered
the rickety dripping fish wagon he unbur-
doned himself of his fears he was a care-
ful man as pere carbon knew his wife
had been young-almost a child yet she
had gone in a day and now what about
his son vic of course he was doing what
he could but who knew for all his care
the little one might snap out like a match in
the wind

  pere carbon considered the matter twist-
ing a strand of wet moss that he had drawn
through the slats of his wagon knowing
his petitioner he did not suggest a second
wife indeed it was through just such deli-
cate distinctions that folk had come to con-
fide in him

  it was life he observed finally one must
expect such things it was best to leave
them to le bon dieu why worry about
them

  however it was possible to set ones mind
at rest by consulting a wise man there
was for example the one on pecan island
perhaps old marcel had heard of him he
it was who threw the card to him such
problems were a trifle and better still
his prophecies were absolutely to be re-
lied on

  the mischief was done old marcels
imagination was fired at once he made his
arrangements next morning he climbed


the killer the king and the wise man



aboard the returning fish wagon and set
out for the marsh and pecan island

  as they went along pere carbon gave cer-
tain instructions this one who threw the
card was queer he said perhaps it was his
great age his wisdom at all events he was
not given to unnecessary speech some-
times he would say nothing at all at best
he would mutter but a word or so let old
marcel think carefully of his question he
might depend utterly upon any forthcoming
answer

  they found the wise man before the door
of his hut a fantastic arrangement of drift-
wood and marsh grass that resembled the
nest of some mammoth muskrat a strange
creature this sage incredibly old and thin
with eyes that seemed to have withdrawn
into the uttermost depths of the red-rimmed
holes of his head squatting motionless in
the full glare of the sun he faced his visitors
with no faintest sign of recognition

  at a word from pere carbon old marcel
squatted also next producing three silver
dollars he laid them silently before him
still the seer remained motionless true
his eyes performed a strange contortion
it was as if they slipped furtively out to the
mouths of their burrows and darted back
again but that was all

  observing this old marcel added a fourth
dollar to the ones before him for all the
effect they produced they might have been
so much lead

  a fifth dollar proved more potent at
sight of it the wise man became instantly
and weirdly alive with one skinny arm he
reached out for the money with the other
he fumbled about at the door of his hut until
he had unearthed a handful of filthy cards
these he nursed into a pack afterward
spreading them backs up in a single sweep
before him

  for three long minutes he eyed the cards
brooding motionless then all at once his
hand went out to hover above them there
was no twist no jerk no downward thrust
so far as the watchers could see yet for all
that a card jumped suddenly out from the
rest to fall back face upward through its
heavy coating of grease and smoke it pro-
claimed itself the jack of spades

  now murmured pere carbon who
squatted just beyond the patrons shoulder

  the moment had come nor was old
marcel unprepared for it thanks to pere
carbons coaching he had his question

ready so carefully had he thought of it
that when he spoke it was as if he emptied
his mind entirely

  my son vic he demanded what
will be his fate

  there was a space of silence for a time
it seemed that old marcel would have only
his trouble for his pains but at last the
wise man spoke slowly wheezingly his
words fluttering out as though born of some
intolerable labor

  he will die in a chair said he

  that was all though old marcel waited
patiently the wise man did not speak again
rather he froze into a still more rigid pose
while his eyes slid back into the lairs ap-
pointed for them

  so muttered pere carbon we will
go now

  and the visitors withdrew leaving the
sage to the solitude of his island

some men might have been dis-
v vm satisfied six words for five dol-
lars there was expense for you

            old marcel however was con-
tent he had learned what he wanted to
know it would have been cheap at ten
times the sum

  his son would die in a chair there it
was-the whole future in those scant six
words for the rest the danger might well
be avoided what if the wise man had said
in a house on a horse here would
have been a problem

  thus old marcel returned hopefully to
the raising of his vic such chairs as he
owned he discarded replacing them with
stools and boxes the thing was quite plain
it had been planned that during his early
years the little one would climb on to a
chair and falling from it destroy himself
with no chairs there could be no destruc-
tion it was easily arranged

  later when vic was running wild about
the prairie old marcel again took counsel
with himself the danger of an infantile
fall was now definitely over new methods
were called for

  should he tell the boy and divide his re-
sponsibility but no such things were
not for the young at the proper time he
would inform him in the meanwhile he
would discover and  thwart any further
menace that fate held in store for his
offspring

  old marcel meant well it was only that


adventure

he placed his faith in good intentions some
few days later he was tossed from the saddle
and went the swift way of a broken neck

ii

bereft of both father and
prophecy vic perrot was bereft of
all else death brings adjustment
of debts and old marcel owed
more than his share of them once these
were settled nothing remained

  somehow vic scrambled through boy-
hood in his teens he left the prairie for
town his late twenties found him at one
of st pierres cypress mills here he looked
after the placing and disposal of the various
lumber piles

  at this time as later he appeared the
least formidable of men he was tall he
was lank and the mildness of his brown
hatchet face seemed mirrored in his milk-
blue eyes save for the struggle of life his
days had been wholly uneventful then
things happened all at once

  they began one day at noon when after
the blowing of the whistle vics boss called
a last order to a dinner-bound hand the
hand a black gorilla-like creature replied
with an oath and kept on

  the result at that time and place was
inevitable having floored the hand with
a new cypress plank the boss dropped the
matter from his mind it appeared merely
one of countless similar incidents that had
gone before

  but this time the noon hour and a grog
shop intervened returning full of mean
liquor the hand sought out the boss
without a word and at point blank range
he shot him dead

  the affair was unfortunately timed
thanks to the recent activities of st pierres
regulators certain of the blacks were on
edge escaping from the cypress mill the
murderer sought refuge with his kind nor
did he seek in vain posses crossing the
bayou to the colored settlement of free-
town were warned not to approach beyond
a given point freetown itself bristled sud-
denly with arms a miniature race war
was on

  it was at this point that vic perrot be-
came involved the murder had left him
stunned he was still stunned when the
mill whistle sounded its call to arms ac-
cepting the weapon that was thrust upon

him vic joined the crowd that streamed
toward freetown

  as he hurried along he wondered just
what he would do he was well armed with
a new colt of large caliber yet for all this
he doubted his ability to accomplish any-
thing up to then his acquaintance with
firearms had been discouragingly casual

  arriving at freetown vic found it de-
serted during the wait for reinforcements
its defenders had withdrawn word came
that they had barricaded themselves in a
dance hall a half mile from town a hardy
band equipped with rifles at once pushed
forward the more timorous and lesser
armed decided to remain behind

  not so vic perrot clutching his colt he
trailed along he was not brave he was
not even curious it was purely mechani-
cal he was still in a daze

   arrived near the dance hall the besiegers
halted those in command considered the
situation the building was old its half-
rotted walls offered the resistance of so
much pasteboard furthermore it stood
in an open space surrounded by brush and
trees

  the plan of attack was as plain as it was
simple five minutes later a ring had been
formed under cover and the firing began at
long range

  from a place in the rear vic followed
these operations as yet his revolver was
useless the affair lacked the thrill that
one would have expected from it here was
a crowd of men shooting into the blank and
decrepit walls of a building they might
as well have been firing at a target vic
looked on dully in a vague way he had
hoped for some fun

  then at a shouted command the ring
closed in and the fun began now a brisk
fire rattled back from the dance hall dark
forms slipped suddenly from its doors and
windows to a last futile dash at escape

  the effect on vic was instantaneous in
a flash his daze gave way to a species of mad-
ness at once he rushed forward making
straight for the dance hall and as he went
he screamed shrilly waving his colt like
some ridiculous flag

  bullets whined past vic from front and
rear voices called to him cursing him for
a fool but he still kept on there was
only one thought in his mind now he must
get himself one of those maddened fugi-
tives it was what he was there for why
the killer the king and the wise man



wait till the rifles had finished them all

  a black figure appeared swinging off to
the left swinging also vic snapped up his
colt he did not seem to aim he was
scarcely conscious of firing yet instantly
and amazingly the figure pitched flat to the
ground

  one thought vic and swung on a
second figure

  the result was the same

  after this the daze came back even worse
than before it was like the time when vic
leaped from the bayou bank to a head-on
collision with a sunken log only when he
bumped into it did he recognize the wall of
the dance hall bullets bit viciously into
its shattered boards yet vic paid no heed

  still mad with the lust of slaughter he
made for the nearest opening one glance
was enough at sight of the shambles in-
side he faced about shouting

  hola he cried it is over stop
shooting and come

ill

back in town again vic found
himself famous despite his evi-
dent foolhardiness he was ac-
claimed the hero of the fight
and a great fight it was for st pierre they
even spoke of it as the battle of freetown

  as for vics deeds they increased with
each hour by dark they had reached the
rank growth which comes inevitably
through repetition

  he was something this perrot he had
captured the dance hall single-handed and
he had not missed a shot he had bagged
six eight-an even dozen in short he was
a killer that said t in a word

  vic himself was far from sure of this
once his madness had passed he realized
that he had merely played the fool he
shrank now from the thought of those myri-
ad whining bullets through what miracle
had he escaped them here was some-
thing impossible to understand

  yet he had the wit to realize his oppor-
tunity at least he had been lucky per-
haps he would be lucky again here was
the promise of something better than the
cypress mill very well he would see
that night he made a triumphant round of
the coffee houses the affair ended as it
had begun-in a daze

in the week that followed vic was

occupied with the aftermath of the fight
though peace was restored he found that
there were many loose ends to tie up cer-
tain black men were questioned a few
were locked up there was even a shoot-
ing or so

  vic played his part in these various pro-
ceedings as one who had earned the right
each day he advanced the subjection of
freetown afterward he repaired to the
gold lion

  as a coffee house the gold lion was su-
preme it purveyed all the comforts of
man its bar of fine wood all but covered
one generous reach of wall space along
the other was ranked a company of small
tables for coffee and cards a restaurant
brought up the rear and above was a floor
of bedrooms

  there was even a barber shop reached by
a small swinging door at the head of the bar
true this last was not of the gold lion
proper but there it was one could push
through the swing door from inner to outer
refreshment

  going out from the other side one entered
an alley floored with planks and closed in
by the high brick walls of buildings here
was a spot superbly adapted to the settling
of personal difficulties it added a final
touch to an otherwise perfect establishment

  a great place-the gold lion through
its doors passed all those who made fervid
the life of st pierre vic could not well
avoid passing also it was the world to
which he aspired

  at first he found it a kindly world he
was perrot the killer his deeds were fresh
in all minds food drinks coffee-these
were fairly thrust upon him at the card
tables it was the same if lucky he pock-
eted his winnings should he lose the debt
was quite good for some other time

  better still was the attitude of his fellow
killers miguez the chief of them seemed
wholly complaisant a small dark man of
spanish blood he accepted vic as a brother
those of less standing followed his example
miguez was a cat with long claws it was
enough that he approved

  thus vic came into his own and for a
time he drifted pleasantly then gradu-
ally there came a change the battle of
freetown passed into history fresh inter-
ests arose from being possible it became
imperative for vic to pay as he went

  this was only as it should be versed


adventure

now in the ways of his world vic found
means to get along but soon he was faced
with a graver problem the hour for fresh
effort arrived

  this also was as it should be a killer
is no better than his kill sooner or later
his brilliance will fade then he becomes
the prey of his kind to survive he must
fill in a new background of red

  as was proper miguez began it indif-
ference changed to coldness next came
hostility thinly veiled there were sneers
half-caught as vic passed along

  so murmured miguez a few black-
birds eh and on the wing one must
do more for a reputation

  vic knew the signs an insult was near
now-swift venomous insult like the stroke
of a snake when it came he must ask
miguez out into the alley and then-

  it was the then that bothered vic
after all what were a few blackbirds
what in fact was his exploit save a matter
of luck luck would not do for miguez
one could scarce count on it a second time

  of course he could shoot it was a natu-
ral gift as he had proved through repeated
practise with his colt but a target was no
more a man than miguez was an ordinary
individual could he shoot with miguez
that was the question

  there remained the cypress mill but
that would be the end of his career yet a
duel might mean the end of life itself an
end-there seemed nothing else in view
and he could not even decide on a beginning

  fearful tormented vic played for time
he moved warily at the gold lion choosing
those hours when miguez was absent
drawn to it by some strange fascination
he walked each day through the alley like
a general considering a battlefield

  in this way he ran across pere carbon

pere carbon knew all about
vic did he not bring fish each
week to the kitchen of the gold
lion and was not the kitchen
a clearing house for the doings in front

  trust pere carbon to know nor had
the years dimmed his usefulness perhaps
he was a trifle more gnarled and sun-
browned that was all

  thus when vic entered the alley he called
to him twisting a strand of wet moss from
his wagon as was his habit in beginning a
conversation he spoke with the blunt-

ness of one long wearied by a race of verbal
fencers

  see vic he demanded why do you
not kill this miguez

  vic shrank as from an indecency his
problem stalked naked before him

  you old fool- he began angrily

  pere carbon raised a hand that was like
the knot of a tree

  pardon said he it is you who are
the fool already folk are laughing at you
and you with your luck let them do so
vic stared he knew of pere carbon
but this-could the old man read ones
mind

  luck he echoed

  as you know went on pere carbon
that other business all those bullets
they did not touch you eh and why
vic nodded

  yes said he that is it why
there was a pause while pere carbon
stared in turn his wrinkles all twisted in a
network of surprise

  cher bon dieu he swore finally and
your old father did not tell you but i was

there myself vic it was this way-

  pere carbon made a good job of it it
was all quite fresh in his mind through
the magic of his telling the prophecy became
a thing alive vic could see the seer of
pecan island-the very card as it leaped
from the sand

  and vic was impressed he was half
convinced all those bullets how else
could the miracle of the dance hall be ex-
plained

  what if the wise man had spoken truly
it yould change the whole face of his prob-
lem he would die in a chair eh that
meant that in the alley he would be safe
from miguez in fact so long as he avoided
chairs he would be safe from any man

  dropping his moss pere carbon waited
vic wavered toward decision he was
thinking of the future now broad vistas
were opening out before him of course
there were certain conditions he turned
to pere carbon

  you have spoken of this business
  not before today

  and you can keep it to yourself

  i have done so all these years

  it was the hour when miguez frequented
the coffee house at the thought vic made
up his mind

  bien said he i will rely on you
the killer the king and the wise man



friend carbon drive out now from this
alley i have business to do

  one minute later vic pushed into the
golden lion as he entered he met mon-
sieur bassin the proprietor in the doorway
a frenchman from france monsieur bas-
sins courtesy had been like some fine gar-
ment from the other side now he spoke
with the tatters of this former politeness

  so perrot said he familiarly you
owe me twelve dollars is it that you are
here to pay

  a snigger sounded from a table near at
hand vic swung on it very much as he
had swung on his victims of the dance hall
miguez came to his feet in a flash his grin
half changed to a snarl then vic spoke
quietly yet precisely that all might hear

  miguez said he i am told that you
question my reputation let us see now if
you will question it again-outside

  four glass-paned doors gave into the al-
ley going over to the first of them vic
drew his colt and waited a moment later
miguez was at the farthest door weapon in
hand there were no seconds no signals
the two started shooting as soon as they
stepped outside

  vic remembered little of what occurred
it was over too quickly for detail he could
have sworn that he fired no more than twice
yet when they picked miguez up three
bullets were in his body

  upon vics next visit to the gold lion
monsieur bassin all but raced forward to
greet him again the proprietors voice
was a benediction it enveloped vic as
with rich clinging folds

  monsieur perrot it said and what
is your order my poor place is at your
command

  vic was established what before had
been a reputation was now the reputation
of st pierre the law made no trouble
it had been a personal affair the few
rules governing such encounters had been
fully complied with

  again vic reaped the rewards of his prow-
ess but with a difference his days of
drifting were over he strode now sure-
footed along the path of his endeavor

  and all through the prophecy its stark
warning became a gracious deliverance vic
cherished it as one cherishes a priceless
gift his faith in it held no faintest shadow
of doubt or question what the -dance hall
promised miguez had assured it was

  

more than enough vic made the prophecy
his religion thence onward it ordered the
course of his life

  the situation was not without its dis-
advantages before vic had looked on
chairs as contrivances for his comfort and
ease now all at once they became his
chief menace and this to one whose for-
tunes moved largely with the run of the
cards

  vic did not hesitate he affected a bore-
dom toward stud and euchre he turned to
roulette vingt-et-un and klondike these
he played briefly standing up to his bets
at the tables his drinks he took at the
bar only his meals found him seated
and through it all he moved with a shrewd-
ness a carefulness that gave no suggestion
of change

  for here was a second menace once
guessed the prophecy would destroy him
as it had raised him up so would it dash
him down again caught off his feet all
his skill would not save him

  this was vics creed born of his super-
stition out of a chair he knew himself in-
vincible in one he was equally assured of
vulnerability

  so he went on extending his activities
now he was out with the regulators again
he changed the destinies of some political
party feuds claimed him both public
and private as a deputy he was unex-
celled

  often he shot through necessity some-
times through pride or sheer wantonness
but always he shot on his feet and always
he came through scatheless

  he became a marvel of killers he prom-
ised always to endure it seemed that noth-
ing could stop him

  then fate the ironical sent poufette
labau to the gold lion

iv

poufette bore scant resem-
blance to an avenging angel as
a mere mortal he was rather ab-
surd he was a short fat man
very puffy and red with a face like that of

a 

  in disposition he was piggish also where
others soared toward their ambitions pou-
fette rooted it was his way

  like vic poufette came from the prairie
he was of crab town a small settlement so


adventure

known through its proximity to the sea
marsh also like vic poufette sought the
dominance of his fellow men but in a
more limited sphere

  poufette was kang of crabtown that
is to say that on saturday nights when the
folk ride in he made a mild nuisance of him-
self then he emerged upon the parish
road with a rusty bull-dog revolver as he
approached the horse rack before the coffee
house he blazed skyward with his clumsy
weapon

  there would come a snorting a snapping
of bridles the mad whir and scatter that
accompanies the flushing of a huddle of
cajun ponies amid this confusion pou-
fette would swagger inside to become his
own herald

  i am poufette he would shout me-
i am king of crabtown

  none gainsaid him chiefly through in-
ertia some one must rule at crabtown
why not poufette in a way it was
amusing and the ponies could always be
rounded up again

  the effect of this was unfortunate of-
fensive always poufette bade fair to become
unendurable his pose was that of a con-
queror in reality he was the cheapest of
cowards

  as such he had avoided the gold lion
upon his rare visits to st pierre here
deeds were sometimes required as well as
words poufette preferred the humbler
places back of town they allowed him to
brag to his hearts content so long as his
cash remained

  thus poufette had some excuse for his in-
discretion he would never have gone to
the gold lion but for the pousse-cafes

  poufette heard of them at the time when
he was surfeited with more ordinary liquors
they were marvelous so said his tempter-
tiny jewels of drinks that were striped like
a barbers pole true they cost money
but what would one have with a rainbow

  this last added to poufettes undoing
niggardly always he presently set forth
alone let his friends wait until he re-
turned his should be the sole glory of
this jewel of drinks cheap whiskey had
made a storm in his brain he would end
it with the bright rainbow of a pousse-cafe

  entering the gold lion poufette made
straight for the bar he ordered grandly
if a trifle thickly afterward he concen-
trated as best he could upon the making of

the drink but here he gained only an im-
pression of confusion it was as if mon-
sieur bassin crowded the entire contents of
his shelves into the minute barrel of the
liqueur glass

  poufette watched fascinated all that
effort for one drink no wonder it cost
money yet when the pousse-cafe was a
thing accomplished he tossed it off with
scarce a glance as became the king of crab-
town

  poufette experienced a feeling of defeat
for all the wonder of the concoction its
full savor had somehow eluded him he
had not managed to get his teeth into it

perhaps another-

  the second pousse-cafe lingered more plea-
santly upon poufettes palate it seemed
to join with the first one producing a warm
rich feeling both above and below this

was better a third one now-

  with the third pousse-cafe poufette forgot
the gold lion he forgot even its suave
and majestic proprietor the tiny drinks
began to assert themselves they were as
final straws upon the burden of the days li-
bations poufette became filled with a vast
importance as was his custom he has-
tened to express it

  i am poufette he bellowed unsteadily
me-i am king of crabtown

  monsieur bassin smote upon his bar he
was like a scandalized bishop

  come he ordered we will have
none of that here were you vic perrot
himself i would not allow it

  the name alone pierced the fogs of pou-
fettes brain he recalled vic perrot as a
long-legged youth who had sometimes rid-
den through crabtown since then he had
heard of him-just what he could not
now remember but no difference it was
enough that he was from the prairie
lurching about poufette addressed the
bar at large

  eh you vic perrot he called bois-
terously come and drink with the king
it will be something for you to talk
about

  his words brought a roar of derisive
laughter even monsieur bassin smiled
but only for a monmet after all this
farce held the elements of tragedy lean-
ing forward he spoke sharply to poufette

  my friendsaid he you are indiscreet
monsieur perrot has a very quick way with
him fortunately he has gone out of town
the killer the king and the wise man



if you are wise you will make haste to fol-
low his example

  poufette did not understand the laugh-
ter had completed his demoralization he
only knew that he had been insulted and
all through this cursed vic perrot

  again he faced round on the room for
the moment his brain was on fire its heat
seemed to shrivel his tongue it clutched
at his throat half choking him

  thus he spoke slowly and carefully his
voice lost its bullying tone now his words
seemed of deadly intent it was the final
misfortune

  so said he vic perrot eh tell
him that when i see him i will attend to
him tell him-

  poufette got no further as if tired of
their sport the pousse-cafes suddenly tri-
umphed there came a blackness thick
and whirling staggering forward pou-
fette collapsed upon the nearest chair

  yet for once he had produced a genuine
sensation it persisted while his friends
were sent for it followed him in his long
insensible journey across the prairie it
endured through the night causing certain
awe-struck citizens of crabtown to awake
their king in the dawn of the following
morning

  they were thorough these citizens
thanks to their visit to the gold lion
they were now fully aware of vics prowess
they left nothing unexplained five min-
utes after their departure poufette was in
the saddle though no horseman he estab-
lished a record that morning between crab-
town and st pierre

  returning at nightfall vic heard of his
rival monsieur bassin informed him with
a wealth of small detail as was his way
but vic shrugged the matter aside he
was tired from the days exertions in ad-
dition he had heard of poufette why
trouble about a drunken braggart he had
earned the right to ignore them

  next morning vic was less confident re-
freshed now his natural caution reasserted
itself as he put on his clothes he recalled
monsieur bassins graphic description
though drunk poufette had finally ceased
his bluster he had ended on a note of
grim determination

  it appeared now that the man meant
business also an envious coward could
become the most dangerous of creatures
vic decided that he would shoot on sight

should poufette return a new king would
be needed at crabtown

  passing out to the street vic made for
the gold lion once inside he pushed
through the swing door into the barber shop
it was his custom to shave before breakfast
his position demanded such niceties

  levee the head barber called a good
morning vic replied slipping out of his
coat having mounted the chair he threw
loose his suspenders like one performing
a rite levee adjusted a hair cloth

  under cover of the hair cloth vic reached
up to the holster beneath his left arm
when an instant later levee tilted him
back his colt lay ready at his waist line
it was only his usual procedure a killers
life is made up of such trifling precautions

  secure and at ease vic abandoned him-
self to the luxury of the moment the hot
towels were of just the right temperature
the lather spread smoothly fragrant le-
vee brush in hand murmured discreetly
vic closed his eyes his thoughts drifted
off upon the flood of small talk

  all at once he came back with a start
had some one called his name from inside
the bar now the voice went on hoarsely
earnest in the barber shop yes i am
poufette labau

  vic brought his head up sharply as he
did so levee reached down for a last touch
of lather face and brush met in soft
smearing impact caught fairly across the
eyes vic dropped back again

  but only for an instant his position
was now acute he must get on his feet
he must free his eyes of the biting smother
that blinded them

  grasping the chair with his free left hand
vic heaved forward he came only a little
way before something checked him puz-
zled alarmed he exerted his strength and
again the mysterious tether snared him at
this moment the swinging door creaked
poufette was entering the barber shop

  a whirl of thoughts swept through vics
tortured mind he was trapped he was
blinded he was in a chair the prophecy
had him let it come then he was ready
as well now as later

  but to be killed by poufette to become
the victim of the king of crabtown it
was too much death came to every man
disgrace was different

  at least he would cheat poufette he
would preserve his reputation his friends


adventure

must not laugh at his memory it must be
said of him that he finished gamely

  as swift as the thought vic shifted his
colt he knew the right spot upon the left
hand side he fairly clutched at the trigger
the rest was a roar of sound

  with the shot poufette entered the barber
shop he had meant to advance in an at-
titude of surrender but the crash of the
colt was too much for him dropping his
hands he used them to cover his face

  mercy he babbled it is a mistake
msieu perrot i am here to apologize i
was drunk i was mad i--

  levee the head barber called to him
roughly from above the huddled figure in
the chair

 come you get out he commanded
msieu perrot is dead and to those
who crowded in a moment later he explained
the stained hair cloth clutched in one trem-
bling hand

  you see said he it was an accident
always had i warned him against that
drawn pistol it came when he struggled
to free himself observe now how his sus-
penders are twisted about the arms of the
chair

i- t is an old saying effendi when
the gipsy comes to the village
guard thy horses and thy women  
this is not written in the koran
but is a saying of the people of bosnia and
there is much truth in these words as i
shall tell thee

  i would rather smoke one of thy ciga-
rets effendi one of those thou hast brought
from istamboul there is good tobacco
anatolian tobacco in them and the smoke is
blue those which i must buy from stef-
anopoulos the greek are bad since the
war began he has mixed tea and laurel
leaves with cheap drama tobacco his
cigarets are poor and so am i but he is
rich

  ayee effendi give me one of thy ciga-
rets and listen to this tale

  my fathers han stood on the plateau of
the konir mountains not far from the city
of banyaluka he was a well-to-do man
and the plum crops which he sold to the
traders of slavonia brought him many
austrian eagles yes effendi it is true
that i am a poor man for i was a second
son and in those days as it is now the
oldest son inherited the estate

  but in the time of which i speak i was
contented to look after my fathers horses
ior there were many and to look forward to

the day when my brothers and i would
drive many wagon-loads of plums across the
save river to hungarian brod where the
traders would buy them and make a hand-
some profit by reselling them to the dis-
tillers who made a brandy from the juice
called slivovic it is a drink of sheitans
make and the faithful do not touch it it
was upon one of our visits to slavonia that
my older brother bought a horse from a
trader

  i can not tell thee effendi how an ara-
bian stallion had found its way into the
hands of an hungarian infidel but it was
there and for sale and murzuk bought the
horse it was named el ghaleb which in
thy language means the conqueror for few
men if any had ever ridden the brute and
this was the reason why it was for sale

  my father was pleased not only because
the price was low but also because he knew
that the pasha of mostar was willing to pay
a goodly sum for an arabian stallion and
that every horse trader in bosnia and in the
hercegovina was on the lookout for such a
horse and many high bids had been made

  i as i have told thee effendi was taking
care of my fathers horses and it fell to my
lot to train the animal so that the pasha
could ride him a spirited horse which
would have thrown abu sharval nay
south of sarajevo



effendi such was not his name but ahmet
agha he was called abu sharval by the
people who always bestow a nickname upon
those whom they do not care to call by
their proper names abu sharval effendi
means father of wide trousers and the
pasha was a turk from istamboul who
ruled the sandchak of hercegovina for the
sultan ul islam a long time before the aus-
trians came to bosnia

  do ask thy questions when i have finished
this tale effendi and leave thy cigarets
on this tambouret so i will not have to ask
thee for another one

  my days were spent in training el ghaleb
there were times when i was willing to give
up in despair for he would not permit me to
mount him but i knew my father had
given me this task and i had to finish it for
my father was a stern man and his punish-
ments were frequent and quick

  one day i had led el ghaleb into the road
which follows the verbas river and leads
from bosna seray into banyaluka there
was little travel in these days and if the
horse would run away it could be in two
directions only for on one side there were
the mountains and the river was on the
other

  as i reached the road from the path
which led down from my fathers han the
cavalcade of the turkish governor from
bosna seray passed me and as was the cus-
tom in these days i salaamed and shouted
the greeting-

  tchok yasha padishahim

  with this shout a change came over the
horse the brute had been restless and
dancing and now he had become docile i
had heard it said that the arabs talk to their
horses and that they had certain phrases
with which to pacify them but i had never
seen it done nor had i believed it this
came into my mind and i quickly took the
opportunity to mount the horse i had to
ride him bareback and i did ride him back
to the han on the plateau of the konir
mountains

  have patience effendi i know i spoke of
gipsies i shall come to this presently
inshallah but these cigarets are good

  from then on ere i would mount el
ghaleb i would whisper the greeting into
his ear and he would become as docile as the
lambs on the plains of dolna douzla

  seeing that the period of training for the
horse had passed and that the pasha would

  be able to ride him my father bid me to take
  the horse to mostar and to sell it to the
  pasha

   quickly i was on my way on the second
 day i reached bosna seray and spent the

  night with my uncle husref beg and in the
  morning i was on my way to mostar which
  is south of sarajevo

   it was on the evening of the third day
 when i came upon a camp of gipsies and
 as i was tired and needed food i decided to
 stop with them i was young then effendi
 and the gipsies are musicians and dancers
 and their women are comely

    just ahead of us was the town of konitza
  on the narenta river on the border line be-
  tween bosnia and hercegovina which
  countries were separate sandchaks in these
  days i did not care to go to konitza for i
  knew no one in the town and the people
  there were not friendly inclined to strangers
  so i stayed with the gipsies

   their king was zulfikar and he was a
 strong man well should i know later on
 the women were cooking pillaw in iron
 kettles and the men were sitting around the
 fires making music some were playing the
 tamboora which is a guitar played with a
 quill and others used the gdsla which is a
 one-stringed fiddle played with a bow

    they played well and i liked the music
  zulfikar accepted the ten piastres which i
  offered to pay for food and my share of a
  tent and his eyes while he talked to me
  strayed often to el ghaleb i knew the
  love a gipsy bears for a good horse and i
  understood but i decided to be watchful


adventure

for most gipsies are horse-thieves and the
turks were quick in their justice only when
no gold tickled the palms of their hands

  no kadi would hang a gipsy for stealing
a horse if the gipsy had a price to pay for
his life and not only were the gipsies
quick with gold to free one of their tribe
but also with their daggers and every
turkish kadi knew it

          the night was cool and after i -
-jft had eaten my fill of pillaw i de-
ided to retire i rolled myself
   into the covers which zulfikar
had provided for me and lay down near the
entrance of the tent so that i could see el
ghaleb where i had tied him to an olive tree

  even before i had dozed off two gipsies
had entered and lain down to sleep in the
tent as i had ridden hard all day i was
tired and i believe i had fallen asleep
the next thing i knew i was laying on my
back and one of my tent-mates was kneeling
on my chest while the other tied my hands
to my sides and then proceeded to strap my
ankles together with his belt

  when they had finished--i was too
dazed to make much of a resistance-they
called for zulfikar but he did not enter
the tent he ordered the men to bring me
out into the open they carried me out and
placed me against a tree then zulfikar
approached me and said-

  wilt thou sell me thy horse moslem
just then my senses returned i knew
that zulfikar would surely take el ghaleb
and that i would receive just punishment
from my fathers hands for having lost the
horse i also knew that zulfikar would not
be able to ride the horse and that i could
trace him and his tribe until i would find
him and bring him to justice no kadi
would be lenient with him if i used my
fathers name and it was a well-known
name in these days effendi so i merely
shook my head and said

  no i will not sell thee el ghaleb for
he is too good a horse to be ridden by a
gipsy besides the horse is destined for
ahmet agha pasha of mostar

  as soon as i had said this i wished i had
bitten off my tongue ere i had spoken for
instead of frightening the gipsy with the
pashas name i only had increased the
gipsys desire for the horse he too must
have known of the pashas quest for an
arabian horse and since the pashas harem

was always well filled due to the efforts of
gipsies i should have known that zulfikar
and abu sharval were not strangers to each

other

  in this i was correct for zulfikar began to
laugh

  so it is for abu sharval that thou art
taking this horse to mostar we are also
going there and the father of widetrousers
would rather take the horse from the hands
of zulfikar his friend than from a bosnian
moslem whom he likes none too well i
ask thee again wilt thou sell me the horse
before i am compelled to buy it from thee

  well did i know what the gipsy meant by
buying the horse quite well did i know
this old gipsy trick and i shall explain it to
thee effendi as i continue this tale

  i was helpless and i cursed myself for
a fool for having camped with zulfikars
tribe i knew that i could not return to my
fathers han should i lose the horse and i
had no desire to betray my fathers trust
so i decided to rely upon my wit and use it
in the course of the affair

  they took me into konitza when the-
morning came and made straight for the
kadis house

  the kadi was an old man and when the
gipsies brought me before him still tied he
was already sitting in his chair of justice
fingering his beads and mumbling prayers
into his long white beard he asked me no
questions but bade zulfikar to state his
case thus he did it

  this man came to our camp last evening
and offered to sell me the horse which thou
wilt see tied to yon post outside this window

	father of all wise men i offered him a
decent price but he wished to take ad-
vantage of a gipsy calling me vile names

	shall pay him a just price and thou wilt
enter the purchase contract into the book
for i shall have protection it shall not be
said that i have stolen his horse lend me
thy ear o wise one and take heed for he
is a violent man and harmful he would
have killed me had we not bound him

  it was useless for me to even open my
mouth there were no calls for witnesses
nor the incantation of the kadi to allah to
send him enlightening so that he might
make a just decision the kadis palm
was already red with gold and i knew be-
forehand what would happen it did

  the kadi ordered his scribe to enter the
purchase into the book of records and
south of sarajevo



zulfikar laid down ten austrian gold
eagles upon the desk in front of the kadi

  note thou wise one that i shall pay
him well and have this sum entered into
the book see thou with thine own eyes
that i am going to place these coins into
his pocket and give me a paper saying that
i have honestly bought the horse

  so saying zulfikar picked up the gold
again and pretended to place the coins into
my pocket gipsies are clever with their
hands and fingers remember effendi they
are experts in all trades of thievery and zul-
fikar expertly placed the coins back into his
own belt from whence they had come

  why did i not remonstrate i have told
thee effendi there were no witnesses and
the kadi was bought oh turkish justice
in bosnia it was different when the
austrians came then many gipsies were
hanging from the gallows but then the
austrians also might have bought the horse
legally and paid with a price set by a mili-
tary court i have seen this done too but
this is another tale

  the kadis scribe entered the sale into the
book of records and made out a paper for
zulfikar and the kadi impressed his ring into
the sealing wax then they turned me loose

  i cried effendi when the gipsies led el
ghaleb away for i was young then and the
fear of my fathers punishment was strong
in my heart zulfikar stopped and saw me
crying this made him laugh and he came
over to where i stood

  would it not have been better for thee
to have sold me thy horse moslem he
asked a searching dog will find bones
and i have looked long for a horse which i
could take to ahmet agha i shall give
thee this cloth to dry thy tears in addition
to the eagles in this pocket

  he stuffed a piece of cotton into my
pocket and his eyes opened wide

  hast thou lost the gold which i have
given thee in exchange for thy horse he
asked in surprize

these gipsies are not only musicians and
thieves effendi they are actors as well

so i stood in front of the kadis
house and looked after the cara-
van which took my horse away
there came one of the soldiers
who in these days were doing police duty
and asked me if i had money i told him

     guilder pieces

i had not he then arrested me on the
kadis orders for being a vagrant in the
town of konitza and threw me into jail
this too was part of the game so that i
could not follow the gipsies and see where
my fathers horse was taken to

  two days i stayed in the jail of konitza
and after i was released i had to spend an-
other day in the willows along the narenta
river picking the vermin out of my clothes
thus i had lost three days and then i de-
cided to go straight to mostar and make a
plea to abu sharval himself

  the pashas palace stood on thehill over-
looking the city and many gardens were laid
out on the hillside through these i had to
pass before i would reach the palace and
there i saw several of the pashas yanitchari
who were trying to tame a horse

  they were out on the lawn and while two
were holding the horse another one was
using a long whip unsparingly

  there are two things effendi which
make me mad men who beat horses and
greeks who sell bad cigarets yes
effendi i will have one more of these good
ones so i ran across the lawn and with
anger in my heart began to shout at the
soldiers i did not recognize el ghaleb at
first for the horse had been badly treated
but i would have acted thus for any
other horse for i love them when it came
to me that my fathers horse was thus
beaten i forgot where i was and used my
fists on the men they in turn began to
tussle and wrestle with me and the noise
rang to heaven

  the man who wielded the whip used it
on me as well as on the horse and my
cries brought out the pasha to see what
all the tumult was about

  well was ahmet agha named abu shar-
val he could have carried many of his
children in his wide trousers ahmet agha
was a fat man and as he approached us he
seemed to roll over the lawn rather than
walk he was out of breath when he reached
us and i was a sorry sight for my clothes
had been torn and my face was bloody
where the rawhide whip had cut the skin

  i tore myself from the grip of the ya-
nitchari and salaamed deeply then i
kissed the hem of his coat and spoke to
him in reverent tones i did not wish to
have him speak first for i knew that his
words would have been an order to throw
me into the tower of his palace i had to


adventure

state my case ere the opportunity was lost
forever

  so i told abu sharval how my father had
obtained this horse for him from slavonia
and that i had been robbed by the gipsies
while traveling to bring the horse to him
that i had seen the soldiers beat the horse
and that i had come to prevent them from
doing so

  there i had made another mistake
effendi for the soldiers were carrying out
the pashas orders and i had no right to
interfere abu sharvals brows wrinkled
and he was about to berate me for my dar-
ing but i gave him no time to open his
mouth

  this horse is strong and a fitting animal
to be ridden by the govenor of hercegovina
and should not be beaten for it will lose
its beauty i said to abu sharval were
it not for this thief zulfikar i would have
brought this horse to thee in good shape
and ready for the hadshi procession in
which thou wilt ride

  there were numbers of moslems in
bosnia in these days effendi who took the
trip to mekka and when they returned
they wore the green tourban of the prophet
and were called hadshi they assembled
for their pilgrimage in the residence towns
of the pashas who governed the sandchaks
and the pasha would lead the procession
all this is passed now effendi and the
faithful are few in this land where only the
servians and the greek get fat

  so abu sharval stroked his beard and
looked thoughtful tell me he finally
spoke how canst thou prove to me that
thou hast not sold the horse to zulfikar
and that it is thy fathers animal i have
bought this horse from zulfikar it is true but
the gipsy has not told me that he had
bought it from thee it was thy own tale
that this sale had taken place at konitza
zulfikar has told me that he had bought the
horse in bosna seray and that he had rid-
den it to mostar

  ridden it i cried o ahmet agha
did zulfikar tell thee that he has ridden this
horse then i can prove to thee that the
gipsy is a liar and a thief and that i
speak the truth has the gipsy left this
city

  nay he is sitting within the palace
drinking moccha and smoking a narghileh
replied the pasha then turning to the
soldiers he ordered omar yussuf and

thee hamid fetch me zulfikar but tell him

not of this affair

the three yanitchari soon re-
turned with the gipsy and
brought him before the pasha i
was standing behind el ghaleb
stroking his neck and zulfikar did not see
me he would not have recognized me at
once for i was disfigured from the cuts on
my face

  zulfikar the pasha said is this the
horse which thou hast bought in bosna
seray and ridden to mostar

  ay o ahmet agha it lis the very same
animal

  but this man the pasha continued
pointing to me tells me that it is his
horse which thou hast stolen from him at
konitza

  the gipsy looked at me and recognized
me after awhile

  this man is a liar said zulfikar look
at him and then consider if a beggar would
have enough gold to purchase such a horse
of araby they do not raise such horses
in bosnia i have paid one hundred turk-
ish pounds for this horse ahmet agha and
i made but ten pounds profit for thou hast
only paid me one hundred and ten

  at this i spoke for the first time since the
gipsy had been called

  ask thy yanitchari to search this thief
excellency i said and in his pocket
they will find the paper the kadis scribe at
konitza had made out for ten austrian
gold eagles and then o ahmet agha ask
this liar to ride el ghaleb in thy garden
if he has ridden him from bosna seray to
mostar he should be able to do it again but
heed my words excellency he can not sit
this horse for el ghalebs back has never
been weighed by any other man but thy
servant

  abu sharval spoke a short command and
ere zulfikar could gather his wits two of
the soldiers held him while a third one took
from his belt the paper i had spoken of
this he handed to the pasha abu sharval
took one look and the furrow between his
brows deepened

   verily thou art a liar zulfikar he said
but then a lie is a stock in trade of every
gipsy i will give thee one more chance
ride thou this horse and i will forget for the
sake of the circassian maiden which thou
hast brought me this day mount this
south of sarajevo



horse gipsy and stay on his back for
if thou art thrown thou wilt not arise be-
fore yussuf has finished tickling the soles of
thy feet with fifty lashes

  at this zulfikars face went white but
he was willing to try he waited until the
soldiers had saddled the horse and then
tried to mount he never straddled el
ghaleb he was thrown as soon as his foot
touched the stirrup and while he was
lying onthe ground yussuf sat on his head
holding him down and omar on his belly
for the gipsy showed fight

  i walked over to el ghaleb the horse
having been beaten showed no desire to run
away and i whispered into his ear-
tchok yasha padishahim

  then i mounted the horse and rode
around the garden when i brought him
back to the pasha the soldiers were busy
preparing for the bastonade which zulfikar
was to receive

  yes effendi the pasha paid me the price
i asked for the horse and after i had told
him of the words which would induce el
ghaleb to permit any man to mount him
he sent me safely back to my fathers han
with an escort of two mounted yanitchari

for there were robbers in the mountains
south of sarajevo before the austrians

came

  zulfikar never forgot the bastonade he
received at the hands of the pashas soldiers
and that i had outwitted him and deprived
him forever of the pashas protection he
swore vengeance but i paid no heed then
and not now i was young then effendi
and reckless and not afraid of any man

  i	am an old man now and poor it is
true compelled to smoke bad cigarets i
thank thee effendi this will be the last one
for my tale is ended but still i am not
afraid of any man nor am i afraid of zul-
fikar who has sworn that he would cut my
throat he too is old now and the ser-
vians have made him a policeman here in
bosna seray i see him once ever so often
but i stand my ground for as i said effendi
old as mehemet ali might be he is not
afraid of any man

  there sings the muezzin from the min-
aret it is time for the evening prayer

  allah u allah mohamet rassoul allah

  inshallah effendi be quick and lock
the door here comes zulfikar and he carries
a saber on his belt
jthe parson and the injun

  ay albert william stone

t

he parson who had been sent
out to round up horses that had
strayed the night before came
back to camp with a prisoner-
a young comanche who rode his horse with
the indescribable grace that only el serpent
can command the young brave was sullen
as he doubtless had reason to be but his
sullenness was tinged with a certain dignity
he had been relieved of his war knife and his
fourteen-foot lance his captor was carrying
both as well as the bow that went with the
quiver of arrows slung on the young savages
back

  milt culpepper the trail boss surveyed
the captive with a coolly appraising eye
culpepper was a veteran of the plains
and knew indians from scalp - lock to
moccasins

  some ketch he observed from his
paint hes scoutin fer a war party this
trail is gettinto be about as safe as the bad
lands fer a white man where did you
round him up

  the parson who answered to the name
of hank blossom if necessary jerked his
thumb over one lanky shoulder

  seen his feathers stickin up over the
edge of an arroyo he explained stalked
him when he wasnt lookin didnt seem
to want to talk so i brought him in

  instead o trimmin him fer his hair right
where you got him i reckon

  the trail boss was being sarcastic the

parson was notoriously averse to taking
human life even of the ubiquitous co-
manche

  well sully prattll try to make short
work of him when he sees him sullys
broodin some ever since he found his brother
layin under that mesquite bush scalped
he dont seem to have no love fer an injun
specially a comanche

  at a gesture from the parson the prisoner
slid off his horse and straightway became
the personification of awkwardness even
his face was immediately overcast with a
slovenly expression his short squat fig-
ure slouched incredibly across his naked
back the quiver was nearly full of arrows
they were cruelly pronged his trunk was
smeared and streaked with bright vermil-
ion his countenance blackened hideously
his coarse hair shone with recent greasing
and a war bonnet of curling buffalo horns
and eagle feathers gave him an aspect that
was both picturesque and repulsive

  speak ordered culpepper in spanish
what has the red brother to say for him-
self

  several lean bronzed cowboys had gath-
ered about to look at the indian most of
them wore two six-shooters although here
and there was a man with only one bowie
knives were a part of every mans visible
armament battered sombreros unbut-
toned vests partly covering flannel shirts
leather chaparejos short boots and huge


the parson and the injun



spurs made up the general sartorial equip-
ment all were smoking cigarets

  the indians countenance was immobile
as a statues his beady black eyes how-
ever roved about as if seeking an avenue of
escape they were sharp as a hawks and
cruel as a wolfs the morning sun shone
brilliantly on his feathered plumage and
paint besmeared body his arms and
shoulders bulged with great muscles

  it will not be well for the red brother if
he does not speak threatened the trail boss
the white man comes peacefully into the
country seeking trade only but your
people lie in wait to plunder and to kill
the red brother was caught lurking on the
trail he is dressed for the warpath
speak what have you to say

  the indian was silent his beady eyes
watchful he was young not more than
twenty if he understood a word of the
language in which culpepper was addressing
him he gave no sign the circle of cowboys
crowded closer each man with his hand
carelessly close to the butt of his gun in
the trail days of texas the indian was legiti-
mate prey these men obviously wanted
to be in at the kill

  in both directions thousands of cattle
stretched grazing they would not be sur-
feited before ten oclock and it was now less
than nine across the pecos river on the
left the numerous escarpments of the staked
plain reared themselves like the walls of a
fortified city on every hand were thickets
of tornilla and mesquite a little- farther
up the trail the cattle were belly deep in the
tall juicy jacaton

  two more cowboys dashed up at this
juncture-swing riders one of them at
sight of the indian jerked his six-shooter
with a movement disconcertingly swift and
leveled it at the captive it was sully
pratt

  spread you gents he ordered crisply
waving the revolver there was a deadly
chill in his voice i dont want to hit any-
body but that-injun

  they scattered including culpepper
sully pratt was a product of the plains who
lived and hoped to die by the law of the
west his natural hate for an indian had
been intensified by the cruel murder of his
brother several weeks before the way
clear he brought the big six gun slowly to
a bead the young indian did not deign to
move

  but the gun was not discharged after all
the parson who was standing close to the
spot where the two horsemen had reined in
had reached up a long arm and knocked
sully pratts hand upward the cowboy
looked down his gray eyes cold as ice

  that theres my prisoner sully the
parson explained im holdin him fer
other purposes besides hes jest a boy
savvy i dont reckon you aim to be killin
a helpless boy do you

  boy sully pratt spoke through his
teeth for all his coolness he was evi-
dently raging within hes an injun
which hes likewise a comanche ill kill
him like i would a rattler dont you try
fer to stop me hank blossom or ill let
daylight through you too

  like a flash his arm which had remained
elevated came down the revolver spat
fire but the shot went harmlessly into the
ground so close to the horse upon which the
cowboy was astride as to cause the startled
animal to plunge the parson had with a
movement as quick as sully pratts own
seized the others wrist and jerked it down-
ward

  now he held the wrist in a grip of steel
while their eyes met and held there was
murder in sully pratts orbs he did not
struggle

ill get you fer this he said quietly
any time returned the parson affably
any time sully i reckon im at your ser-
vice but dont you hurt that injun while
hes my prisoner

  he dropped the wrist and walked delib-
erately to where the young savage was stand-
ing from around his waist where it was
coiled he unwound his horsehair lariat
and proceeded to bind the captives hands
then he turned to culpepper

  im thinkin maybe we kin git him to
talk after a while he remarked if its
all the same to you ill keep an eye on him
ontil we make camp tonight

  the trail boss knew that he had been
witnessing something that would probably
result in death for somebody but his man-
ner was as cool as though the parson had
merely remarked upon the state of the
weather he nodded toward the indians
superb spanish horse

  stick him on his hoss an tie his feet to-
gether underneath he suggested to-
night maybe we kin git something out of
him anyway while we got him in camp


 adventure

it aint likely the injuns will tackle us
theyll try to steal him first

  yes an if youll take my advice youll
fix him so they wont git to steal nothin but
an injun carcass without no hair attached
remarked joe ward a thick-set cowboy in
the surrounding group them comanches
is the slickest night thieves in the world
the trail boss looked at him

  you savvy injuns pretty well dont
you

  do i ward spat i savvy em well
enough to know that the only safe co-
manche is a dead one an even then i
wouldnt trust one of the sons o guns
then i reckon you better take this
here redskin in charge culpepper ordered
youre detailed to keep an eye on him to-
night if theys anybody able to spot an
injun in the dark it oughta be you

  to insure temporary peace at least the
trail boss ordered sully pratt on point duty
up where the mess wagon with its soiled
and patched canvas creaked and shrieked
its way across the prairie the indian cap-
tive was kept at the rear under the eye of
joe ward the parson apparently satis-
fied with the arrangement performed his
duty as horse-wrangler for the day

at two oclock the herd which
had been resting after its noon
watering in the river began to
graze they kept it up until twi-
light when they were herded into close cir-
cular formation and bedded down for the
night

  all through the day joe ward had at
intervals plied his ravage charge with ques-
tions delivered in english spanish and vari-
ous brands of polyglot with which the cow-
boy was familiar but the young indian
preserved a dignified silence not showing by
even the flicker of an eyelash that he gath-
ered the white mans meaning

  the wagon was drawn up and the rope
corral strung for the night herd of horses
the cook built a huge fire and busied him-
self in preparation for supper he drew
water for the coffee out of a spigot from one
of the barrels lashed to the side of the mess
wagon his cooking utensils he recovered
from the untanned rawhide that swung un-
derneath  cowboys rode in and helped them-
selves to tin pans of sizzling bacon and beans
they wolfed down soda biscuits and drained
big tin cups of black coffee then detailed

on guard duty for the first two hours of
night they rode forth again their places be-
ing shortly taken by the men they relieved

  the young indian steadily refused all of-
fers of food he had been taken down from
the horse his feet securely trussed together
and placed in a reclining position on the
ground his head propped against a saddle
blanket his blackened face was more hid-
eous than ever in the firelight at a proffer
of water in a tin cup however he unbent
enough to swallow a few mouthfuls his
eyes were constantly alert

  culpepper and the parson conferred in
low tones back of the mess wagon sully
pratt had come in sullenly eaten his sup-
per and departed on guard duty

  i dont want no trouble between you two
boys the trail boss was saying of
course it aint right to kill even an injun
after youve got him helpless but we got
to remember that sully aint got no call to
love a comanche maybe if you or me had
seen what sully seen-

  ill stick around if its all the same to
you said the parson i didnt say nothin
before milt but theys a lot of injun sign
around looks right fresh to me too
shouldnt wonder but what theyre figgerin
on attackin us one o these times thought
maybe we could get somethin out of this
young redskin

  we couldnt do it by any pink tea
method the trail boss declared i dont
like his looks these boys of mine are all
old stagers an kin take care of themselves
agin four or five times their number in in-
juns even comanches but if the war
party is a thousand or so-an ive heard
theyre gittin up a reglar army to clean the
trail-thats another story i reckon id
better keep the outfit on duty tonight
well have to git in some sleep when the
herd lays down tomorrow mornin

  the parson approved he offered to re-
lieve joe ward in his watch over the captive
but ward scornfully refused all aid

  i reckon i dont need no help to look af-
ter no ornery no-account comanche he
declared whereupon the trail boss sent
the parson out on scout duty the horse
herd especially would have to be watched
closely for the comanche steals horses first
and goes on forays for human life after-
ward

  the night was a perfect one cool and with
a light breeze the cowboys rode herd
the parson and the injun



  much as usual save that they did their noc-
  turnal humming in subdued tones ciga-
  rets were lighted in carefully cupped hands
  the men relieved each other for two-hour
  shifts the extra ones rode in a wide circle
  within sight and hearing of the camp but
  far enough away to encounter any creeping
  indians if they were lucky

    throughout the night the indian lay with-
  out moving the dying fire reflecting be-
  tween the half-closed lids of his black eyes
  he was not asleep but he was so motionless
  that joe ward caught himself nodding sev-
  eral times his efforts to engage the cap-
  tive in conversation continued to be un-
  availing the snort of the horses within
  the rope corral became a sort of symphony
  in the cowboys ears the occasional soft
  bellow of a steer registered faintly upon his
  consciousness

he came to himself with a start
as two riders came up to the fire
and dismounted preparatory to
turning their horses into the cor-
ral one of them was the parson the
other was culpepper

    wheres the injun demanded cul-
 pepper

    ward rubbed his eyes the indian was
  miraculously gone

    why doggone it he was there jest a
  minnit ago he exclaimed

    he leaped to his feet and staredatthespot
  where the captive had been only the mat-
  ted grass at the side of the blanket roll tes-
  tified to his recent presence

    with an oath ward sprang into the dark-
  ness outside the circle of fire pulling his
  six-shooter as he ran the other two men
  followed suit fifty yards away they dis-
  cerned two dim forms rising upright from
  the ground the three guns spoke simul-
  taneously streaking the gloom with flame

 but the shadowy forms had melted into the
  darkness followed a double gallop of un-
  shod hoofs over the prairie too late the
  trio bethought them of their own horses
  in a moment they were riding pell-mell
  through the mesquite shooting as they
  galloped

    fortunately they were far enough from
  the sleeping herd to preclude likelihood of a
  stampede a few minutes mad galloping
  carried them far enough away to convince
  them that they were being uselessly reckless

    when they returned empty-handed to the

camp-fire the cook had thrown some wood
on it and the resulting blaze lighted the
ground all around culpepper pointed to
the spot where the indian had lain

  theres whats left of hanks lariat he
growled slashed through pretty slick
work all right he turned to the crest-
fallen ward i thought you was the gent
that understood injuns so well

  the cowboy for once had nothing to say
the episode was outside the pale of even
his vast experience the trail boss spoke
rapidly

  this means an attack sure as shootin
in less than two days boys somebodys
got to make it to fort sumner an bring
back the dragoons ill call fer volunteers
right away

  the parson had bitten off a huge chew of
twist tobacco and was working his jaws slow-
ly his sombrero was shoved to the back of
his head revealing his corrugated forehead
with a few straggling hairs streaked with
gray falling across it

  we kin save time by startin now he
remarked to joe ward git your hoss
joe it lacks about two hours of daylight
an well have to lay hid all day like as not
ward was feeling distinctly de trop he
stared at the parson with positive gratitude
in his eyes to be permitted to accompany
the parson on such an errand after the fool
he felt he had made of himself was seized
upon as an honor likewise he signalized
his elation by seizing the parsons great
hand and wringing it

  its a dangerous mission boys cul-
pepper cautioned but i dont know of
anybody id trust to see it through more
than you hank ward winced strad-
dle your bosses an vamose an fer-s

sake dont let no prairie grass grow under
your feet while youre travelin my hair
feels loose

  the trail boss knew indians

fort sumner was a hundred
and fifty miles distant the two
travelers covered twenty-five miles
by daylight when they sought
cover in the low hills that flanked the pecos
at the first assault of darkness they roused
themselves ate cold bacon and biscuits
without coffee and resumed their journey
the indian they knew does not attack at


adventure

night save in rare instances by daylight
they had done eighty miles more but when
the darkness had faded they discovered
themselves on a part of the trail that
bisected a vast expanse of flat treeless plain
the nearest hills were ten miles farther on

  i reckon weve got to keep goin the
parson drawled

  he was not deceived by the peacefulness
of the scene the sky was cloudless the
sun blazing in all its heated glory drenching
the drab plain in gold and bathing the thick-
ets of mesquite and chaparral not another
living thing was in sight although during
the night they had startled a sleeping herd
of buffalo and precipitated a thunder of
hoofs that would have drowned out the roar
of niagara

  at the left of the trail a quarter of a mile
distant was the pecos river it was effec-
tually hidden from view by perpendicular
sharply cut banks ten to twenty feet high
already the horizon was dancing and palpi-
tating in the heat

  joe ward shaded his eyes and stared to
the westward where a low hill rounded it-
self into the skyline he was as revealed
by the broad daylight a powerful deeply
bronzed man of thirty-five clad in the usual
sombrero flannel shirt short boots and
chaparejos his ragged vest hung open and
a blue cotton neckerchief partly shielded his
corded throat besides the six-shooters in
his holsters he carried a henry repeating
rifle across the pommel of his saddle the
parson was similarly accoutered

  that there hill would be a blame good
place to stand off a bunch of injuns ward
remarked

  the parson nodded abstractedly like
his companion he was bronzed and powerful
but with a strength unrevealed by the gen-
eral deceiving looseness of his physical con-
struction he rode his horse with stirrups
thrust stiffly out before him his lanky body
swaying easily to the movements of the ani-
mal his deeply lined face was so grave
as to be almost lugubrious the parsons
sobriquet came from several sources he
rarely smiled almost never laughed and at
times displayed an almost womanish dis-
taste for the rough horseplay of his associ-
ates yet when occasion arose he was a
fighting man of bravery and resource cool
under pressure of the most desperate emer-
gency and the champion tobacco-chewer of
the outfit

  he was chewing now steadily and rumi-
natively he glanced at the hill indicated
by his companion although as a matter of
fact he had noted it some time before

  were shore takin a long chance out
here without no cover continued ward
he had recovered his lost sang froid obvi-
ously you cant never tell when theys
injuns lurkin around there aint any-
thing more all-around sneakin than an in-
jun you ought tove let sully pratt shoot
that there redskin you captured hank
that would have meant one less of the
cussed ornery murderin skunks to bother
with anyhow

  the parson spat thoughtfully

injuns aint so bad when you git to know
em he observed his companion snorted
aint so bad as what an earthquake
an injun is the most reeligious critter
they is the parson went on

  reeligious ward turned in amaze-
ment injuns reeligious he laughed
scornfully they believe that an injun
that dont git scalped goes to the happy
hunting ground and that if he does git
scalped he aint even worth buryin if
thats what you call reeligious a scalped
injun is jest carrion fit fer crowbait ac-
cordin to an injuns reeligion

  the parson was silent and joe ward con-
tinued as he flecked a horse fly away from
his mounts ears

  an injun is the most ontrustworthy
skunk they is hell pretend to be your
friend an then scalp you when your backs
turned an injun aint got no conscience
whatever he wants he takes if he kin git it
if he gits it hes been right he thinks if
he dont hes jest onlucky you saved that
young bucks life the other day all right
an sully pratts down on you maybe hell
take a pot shot at you some day youve
got a white man down on you but you aint
made no friend out of that injun hell
stick a knife into you if he gits a chance
mark my words

  he didnt stick none into you when you
went to sleep i notice

  the loquacious ward was effectually
squelched once more

  i reckon he was too much set on giftin
away he muttered this sure is a won-
derful mornin speaking from a weather
standpoint

dont turn your head joe the parson
said suddenly his tone was low but
the parson and the injun

head your hoss casual-like toward that there
hill you been talkin about easy now

  the others poise became rigid and the
muscles of his neck swelled visibly

  what dye see

 nothin maybe the parson spoke
quietly somethin stickin up above the
edge of the river bank maybe its a sprig
o cactus maybe somethin else some
ways you look at it it might be a feather

  he was observing the projection above
the bank out of the corner of his eye the
object moved slightly he thought then
it disappeared the parson did not raise
his voice

  dig in joe an ride like - fer that

hill

  under the sharp rake of the huge spurs
the two animals sprang forward as if released
from a steel trap in something less than
a dozen heart-beats they had covered a
hundred yards in the direction of the hill

almost at the same instant the
peace of the morning was shat-
tered by a bedlam of blood-cur-
dling yells shot through with the
terrifying falsetto that characterizes the in-
dian shout of triumph everywhere the
two men looked back and beheld a band of
fifty or more comanches racing toward
them out of a draw that cut through the
rivers bank they were superbly mounted
crouched low on their horses withers and
plying quirt and heel madly

  as the white men had been riding all night
their mounts were anything but fresh those
of the indians were obviously anything but
tired doubtless they had been riding
leisurely up the arroyo cut by the river hid-
den from sight by the deep banks the un-
even race continued about twenty seconds
when one of the foremost indians fired a
rifle and wards horse plunged to its knees
the rider went sprawling over its head

  instantly the parson reined in so sharply
that his horse was jerked to its hind legs
pawing the parson sprang from the sad-
dle wards horse shot through the heart
was kicking feebly without losing an in-
stant of time the parson pulled his huge
bowie knife from its sheath and plunged the
keen blade into his own animals throat
severing the jugular vein blood spurted
over his hand in a crimson stream

  wards horse it developed had fallen at

the edge of a buffalo wallow and ward now

  

  lay within the depression it was two or
three feet deep and eight or nine feet in diam-
eter while his own stricken animal was
sinking to its knees the parson crouched
behind the dead horse effectually shielded
from the rifle and arrow fire of the oncoming
indians and brought his repeating henry
rifle into play it belched a stream of lead
from its capable muzzle and three of the
racing savages tossed their hands into the
air uttered wild yells and toppled to the
ground their horses instantly whirled and
galloped back the way they had come the
remaining comanches reined in and began
to retreat

  ward groaned

  i got that bullet in the laig i reckon
he said it hurts like thunder an i cant
seem to handle it take a look will you
hank

  the parson looked swiftly you got it
in the fleshy part of the calf he reported
it aint goin to interfere none with your
shootin yet jest pull yourself up here an
onlimber your henry theyll be cornin
agin in a minnit

  the parsons horses dying convulsions
had ceased with calm strength its owner
grasped it by one of its hind legs and yanked
it half way around so that it lay parallel
with the other animal the beleagured
men now had a complete breastworks the
parson shoved his rifle across the warm
body and squinted through the sights

  come along as soon as you want to he
invited well get a few of you anyhow
you all right joe

  his tone was solicitous his manner de-
tached ward groaned again and pain-
fully wriggled himself to a position behind
his dead horse thrusting his rifle into place
the injured leg sprawled out behind him
the putty pallor of his bronzed face was al-
ready being replaced by the surge of fighting
blood

  all right he muttered with a stifled
oath hope youre satisfied now hank
you see what your blame foolishness over
that injun has done fer us

  im right sorry about that busted laig
the parson returned its makin you sort
o peeved i reckon he did not take his
eyes from the indian band which had come
to a stand cunningly out of range and was
conversing with many gesticulations

  ward groaned again

  you dont give injuns credit with bein


adventure

smart he persisted after that young buck
got away they figgered somebodyd maybe
be sent to fort sumner fer help after theyd
been so nervy when comancties git that
bold white men better keep their eyes peeled
if-

  oh dry up interrupted the parson
good-naturedly im busy watchin them
redskins

  in the distance the attackers were a pic-
ture of grace as they sat on their superb
mounts their war bonnets waving in the
breeze round-muscled thick-set indians
they were with chests like barrels and shoul-
ders that bulged with hard muscles their
heavily greased hair glistened in the sun
save in times of war the comanche cared
little for ornamental head dress but these
warriors heads were adorned with curving
buffalo horns and eagle feathers the faces
of some were painted a dull bronze others
a jet black their bodies naked to their
breech-clouts were streaked liberally with
vermilion

  their horses likewise were naked except
for bridles and hair-ropes the latter loosely
knotted around their barrels over their with-
ers the parson had taken advantage of
the lull to reload his weapon and now held
it ready for instant use

  presently another concerted yell split
the air

  here they come joe announced the
parson hold your fire ontil they git right
close then let em have it

  the band charged toward the buffalo
wallow at breakneck speed just within
range they turned suddenly and began to
race in a circle sending in a shower of bul-
lets and arrows from every side

  the two white men were now treated to a
sight they might have admired under other
circumstances the comanche had the
reputation of being the most skilled horse-
man of all the north american indians
with incredible dexterity each savage shoved
his bent right knee into the slack of his
hair-rope seized the bridle and mane in his
left hand curled his left heel tightly into his
horses left flank and dropped out of sight
on the right side with only a hand and foot
visible to the besieged men

  thus hanging the racing comanches fired
their weapons from under the horses necks
the circle gradually drawing in the two
cowboys were forced to whirl and shoot in
several directions especially as the attackers

circled behind them but as was ever the
case with such men they remained cool un-
der the shower of bullets and arrows picking
their targets as carefully as though shooting
in a friendly contest they wasted no lead
and in less than a minute their well placed
shots had knocked over six horses leaving
as many indians writhing on the ground
the circle broke and the indians dashed
away toward the river

  the carcasses of the horses were studded
with arrows the men reloaded rapidly

  you murderin coyotes shouted ward
shaking a bronzed fist at the band which
had again drawn up just out of range

  in the heat of the attack he had tempo-
rarily forgotten his wounded leg the par-
son laughed aloud for the first time in
days

  them injuns done some right good
shoo tin he remarked how they kin
hang by their toe nails an handle their guns
an bows too beats me they must be tol-
erable mad jest about now to think they
aint been able to kill us yet

  the sun was rising higher and blazing
down with pitiless heat already under
pressure of the excitement and strain
the parson was conscious of a mounting
thirst they had no canteens having ex-
pected to remain close to the river on their
journey as for ward his wounded leg
was sending the thirst of fever through his
veins parching his tongue and throat with
its insistent demand

  im awful dry hank he said we
got to git to water some way

  not while daylight lasts the parson
said with conviction them redskins wont
take their ugly eyes off us while they kin see
its a quarter of a mile to the river joe
too bad i reckon youre right thirsty
i reckon i am replied ward with a
groan if you hadnt done like you done
with that young comanche buck we
wouldnt be in this here cussed mess

  the parson was peering over the side of
his horse	a

  blamed if they aint cornin agin he
exclaimed this time theyll do their all-
fired durndest

  there was no time for further comment
the racing circle was once more closing in
and a shower of bullets and arrows were fly-
ing the bedlam of savage yells would have
struck terror to hearts less stout by the
time the circle had again been broken the
the parson and the injun



rifles of both men were empty and the par-
son was tugging at one of his revolver hol-
sters howling their disappointment the
attackers retreated and the cowboys wiped
the pouring sweat from their faces with
grimy hands more indians lay on the
ground and several additional horses had
been bowled over testifying to the expert
marksmanship of the white men

  the strain was telling on ward his face
had gone pallid under the bronze and he lay
panting a bad sign the parson pulled off
his neckerchief and wiped his companions
countenance with it

  nine dead injuns out there besides
eight wounded ones he said encouragingly
an a dozen hosses they cant stand
much more of it they wasnt moren
fifty to start with

  thats all groaned ward jest fifty
blood-thirsty injuns agin two white men
two dead hosses an a buffalo waller id
rather fight a million injuns though than
this cussed thirst

  well crawl over to the river after dark
the parson promised jest keep a stiff
upper lip joe

         men of softer fiber would have
sajjfigsl perished under the fearful assault
of the sun that day to these
men it was all in a days work
save for his wounded leg even the complain-
ing ward might have shown greater forti-
tude under the strain

  the parsons right arm was covered with
the dried blood of his dead horse and his
face was a study in filth and perspiration
ward was in similar plight yet the cur-
rent of life ran strongly within them despite
their thirst and the fact that they had eaten
nothing since the night before

  the parson reached up and unbuckled the
saddle bag of his dead horse extracting a
slab of raw bacon and a couple of biscuits

  itll make us thirstier than ever but we
got to eat he remarked tossing part of the
food to ward

  i dont want nothin to eat ward de-
murred with a curse all i want is
water

  weary to the point of exhaustion they re-
mained in the wallow through the long hours
of the super-heated day ward sank into
a kind of stupor but the parson remained
watchfully alert the sun was sinking to-
ward the fringe of western hills before the

indians again showed signs of activity in
the meantime they had alighted from their
horses and were squatting on the ground in
a circle evidently holding a council of war
a painted figure was in the center of the
circle gesticulating

  long distance sharp shooting heralded the
resumption of the attack the indian is
cunning but not subtle the parson roused
ward with difficulty by shouting in his ear
and shaking him by the shoulder

  theyre gittin ready to make a charge
he said itll be the last one today i
reckon git your rifle up

  ward struggled wearily to the proper po-
sition four abreast the indians came on
with blood curdling yells the front rank
began shooting the beleagured men waited
until the indians were well within range
and then fired two of the foremost indians
toppled out of their seats followed in an in-
stant by the other two the second rank
suffered a like fate their horses falling back
on their haunches and plowing up the dust
with their hoofs

  but it was clear that the comanches had
determined upon a desperate expedient this
time the third rank split apparently by
previous arrangement and circled in oppo-
site directions the maneuver was unex-
pected and confusing the parson shot one
of the circlers out of his saddle but before he
could fire again the other three were behind
him pouring in a shower of arrows with the
speed only a comanche can show the par-
son felt a sharp sting in his left shoulder and
the pronged point of an arrow protruded
through the muscles at the same instant
ward fell forward on his face an arrow in
his back

  the parson whirled gun at shoulder and
fired something struck him in the breast
with stunning force he had the impres-
sion of being the center of a rapidly revolv-
ing circle with the two dead horses clinging
blurringly to the edge he recovered him-
self and squinted through the sights of his
rifle

  before him the black hideously painted
countenance of a savage suddenly ma-
terialized

  the curving buffalo horns and streaming
eagle feathers of the head dress were awry
the indian was not more than fifty feet
away riding straight toward the muzzle of
the white mans gun the parsons finger
pressed the trigger even as he saw the arrow


adventure

leave the string of the savages bow and his
ears registered the twang

  instinctively he jumped to one side the
rifle had jammed with a yell of triumph
the indian came on a second arrow already
leaping out of its quiver it flew straight
for the white mans breast but missed its
mark only because the parson suddenly
dizzy fell forward on his face the arrow
buried itself to the haft in the carcass of the
parsons horse

  in an instant the savage had leaped from
his horse and jerked out his war knife and
was running swiftly toward the fallen man
a long leap brought him astride the others
motionless body he seized the parsons
long tangled hair with a fierce grip jerked
his head cruelly backward and was about to
slash the scalp at the hair roots when some-
thing gave him pause he was staring at
the bronzed face of the white man

  he uttered a guttural exclamation and
sprang to his feet both hands held high
the other comanches had closed in with
the cessation of firing from the buffalo wal-
low yelling in savage triumph they
paused at sight of their fellow warrior stand-
ing in the pit astride the body

  a profound stillness ensued broken only
by the guttural voice of the savage in the
buffalo wallow he talked rapidly using
many gesticulations there were some pro-
tests from the other comanches some of
whom had already gained the ground in an-
ticipation of the scalping of the other white
man but the warrior held them back with
the force of his authoritive eloquence slow-
ly they remounted and withdrew

  the parson was not entirely unconscious
as in a dream he had felt the release of the
clutch on his hair and the thud of his head
as it again struck the ground the gallop
of retreating hoofbeats was diminishing in
his muffled ears followed a quiet space
during which he found himself wondering
in a detached sort of way if the fire in his
breast would ever cool then his head was
again lifted this time with almost womanly
gentleness

  drink ordered the guttural voice in
spanish this time

  the cooling water laved the parsons
parched throat in a moment he had re-
vived sufficiently to push the receptacle-
it was his own sombrero-away and point
to the motionless form of ward the sav-
age nodded and a moment later ward too

was gulping eagerly the parson his back
supported by the edge of the wallow looked
down at his breast and plucked away the
arrow that had pierced it his senses told
him that it was not a serious wound

  the white men will go to the river the
indian was saying his horse stood a few
yards distant with ears pricked forward
there was no sign of the other comanches
ta-wah-que-nah will return after a time
with horses for his white brothers then
they shall ride safely to the lodge of their
medicine-chief it is not necessary that
they bring the white warriors of the fort for
the protection of the herds of tame buffalo
ta-wah-que-nah son of ee-shah-ko-nee has
said it

  he walked awkwardly out of the pit and
sprang upon his horse in which position he
immediately became a figure of rare grace
the gallop of hoofbeats died away the
sun went out of sight behind the hills as the
parson and joe ward limped to the river
where the latter bathed his wounded leg and
drew in the evening air in great gulps the
world once more was looking rosy to ward
the parson had plucked the arrow out of
his companions back revealing that it too
had made but a flesh wound

  it was your young buck ward asserted
presently lying back with his injured leg
soaking in the current i seen that much
i reckon youll claim now that an injun
aint such an onappreciative skunk after
all well its the first time i ever
knowed of one there must be some-
thin back of it who is ee-shah-ko-nee
anyhow

  hes the chief of the comanches re-
plied the parson absently what makes
me mad is there wasnt no need of takin
this trip to fort sumner judgin from what
our young injun friend says weve put in
a days fightin fer nothin milt culpep-
pers outfit is as safe now as if they was all
in church

naval duelists

by eugene

--isurprizing number of ameri-
can naval officers have been killed
in affairs of honor of the
uj thirty-six lieutenants whose
names appear on the naval register in 
two stephen decatur and henry vandyke
and of the  midshipmen three are
later listed as killed in a duel it was
the day of the code of honor all over the
civilized world the american navy cruis-
ing in old world ports where the very term
republic was a red rag very often found
it necessary to uphold the dignity of their
young nation in the approved fashion

  in february  while the chesapeake
new york john adams and enterprise lay
at malta some officers went ashore to the
theater one evening in the lobby was the
secretary of sir alexander ball the gover-
nor a noted duelist he had come in for
the avowed purpose of getting a yankee for
breakfast it would seem that he used
discretion in adding to his reputation for he
carefully selected midshipman joseph bain-
bridge a sixteen-year-old boy as victim
bainbridge finding himself roughly jostled
and seeing the secretary walk calmly away
without apology commented upon the in-
cident to lieutenant stephen decatur

  back came the secretary and again jostled
bainbridge remarking in a loud voice-
those yankees will never stand the
smell of gunpowder

  bainbridge instantly knocked him down
and as soon as he could get up the fellow
challenged the boy decatur ordered the
midshipman back to the ship and with an
unpleasant smile began arrangement of de-

unningham

tails as challenged party the american
made the terms

  now said decatur we will go to the
beach at sunrise tomorrow there we will
place our men back to back and at the word
march they shall each march two steps
and then whirl and fire there shall be
only the one word

  my- man protested the english

second that is clear murder

  your man retorted decatur coolly
is an experienced duelist he has picked
for his victim a young officer with no experi-
ence whatever by my terms they are
placed on as nearly equal footing as possible
however sir if you dont wish to fight in
that way i will take the place of the
midshipman and meet your man at ten
paces

  but the secretary preferred to fight a boy
so decatur went back to the ship and
brought bainbridge on deck with a ship-
mate back to back he placed them bain-
bridge with an empty pistol at the word
march bainbridge took two steps
whirled and clicked his weapon through
the whole night decatur drilled him until
he performed the evolution with mechani-
cal precision and amazing speed

  at sunrise he was placed back-to-back
with the noted duelist at the word both
stepped off two paces and whirled but
the young midshipman drilled by canny
decatur was quickest he shot the secre-
tary dead in the circumstances it was as
much for the honor of the american flag as
if the two participants had commanded
men o war

rolf bennett

author of the sleeping partner the cask etc

        ie were seated on a bench in the
park the seafaring man and i
watching an endless stream of
luxurious motor cars pass by with
their even more luxurious occupants we
had been sitting there quite a long time
without exchanging a word when the sea-
faring man suddenly took the pipe from his
mouth and pointed with the stem at the
procession of cars

  i once knew a man he said who could
have bought up the whole gilded bunch
yes sir cars fur coats and their wads as
well every mothers son of em in solid
cash-gold

  he must have been very rich i sug-
gested

  rich it wasnt-it wouldnt have been

the word rich bgee well-

  the seafaring man paused unable seem-
ingly to find an adequate word to express
such vast wealth

  yes he went on hed have been the
richest man in the world i reckon and it
all depended so to speak on a rubber plant
a pair of pants and a parrot well its a
queer story

  i pressed him to tell it to me after
thoughtfully filling his pipe and lighting it
he smiled sadly and began

  this here man im telling you of was
called bill hawkins william hawkins on
the ships papers but bill all the rest of the

time and youd never have thought not
by looking at him that hed come so near to
being a multi-millionaire he was well
just ornary and his language and manners
what he had of em-about the same

  well now one day bill lost his ship i
dont know what made him late but when
he got down to the wharf on sailing day
shed gone so there was bill high and dry

and with not a penny-piece to keep the-

from dancing in his pocket of course he
tried to get a berth on some other ship but
theyd all signed-on their crews and there
was nothing doing he tried for other jobs
but his luck was dead out as the saying is
and he slept that night under a shed

  next day was just the same well he
was piled up good and proper bill was and
no two ways about it and then somehow
maybe honestly and maybe not bill got
hold of a rubber plant in a pot which he
thought he might be able to sell for the price
of a dinner

  so he went around all the streets by
the docks trying to sell this here rubber
plant but nobody wanted it well he was
just thinking of heaving the blamed thing
through the window of a police station and
getting free board and lodging that way
when he saw a woman washing down a door-
step

  want to buy a rubber plant says he

  no

the bird of fortune copyright  by rolf bennett is
the bird of fortune

  itll look fine on the parlor table says
bill and you can have it for sixpence
says he

  i aint got sixpence to spare says the
woman but ill give you a pair of my
lodgers old pants for it

  right says bill maybe i can raise a
few pence on the pants hand em over

  which she did and bill took them they
werent bad pants neither but the pattern
made bill feel dizzy checks they were
with black and white squares the size you
see on a chess-board or pretty nearly
well he tried his darndest to sell them
pants bill did but nobody would have
them maybe the pattern frightened them
but there it was and there was bill as far
away from a dinner as ever

  at last a notion struck bill you or med
have thought of it right at the start but
bill was what you might call a bit of a
dreamer he felt in the pockets star-
board pocket nothing port pocket noth-
ing starn pocket well he found something
then and what do you think it was
money

  no sir it was a pawn-ticket a pawn-
ticket showing that a feller called brown had
put a parrot up the spout for five shillings

  now a pawnbroker thinks bill wouldnt
lend five bob on a parrot unless it was worth
a mighty lot more and thinks he if i take
this here ticket to moses maybe hell buy
it and then he can sell the parrot right
away

  so round goes bill to the shop

  here says he slapping the ticket on
the counter i want to sell this give me
seven shillings and a tanner and the parrots
yours	i

and then a queer thing hap-
sggsjjgf pened i dont suppose its ever
happened before nor ever will
again the pawnbroker grabbed
the ticket dived under the counter and
came up again with a parrot in a cage

  here says he dumping it on the coun-
ter you can take this blooming fowl away
-and be slippy about it too its eating
me out of house and home he says its
not a parrot its an ostrich by its appetite
ill let the five bob go now clear out

  well bill could have almost cried hed
reckoned on raising at least five bob and all
hed got was a parrot with an appetite like
an ostrich

  hanged if i wouldnt wring your neck for
two pins says bill to the parrot youd
make a meal anyway he says

  fifty south and forty west sings out
the parrot cocking an eye at bill

  i dont want none of your back-an-
swers says bill getting rattled you
speak when youre spoke to he says or
ill dump you into the harbor and all
latitude and longitude give me the
word screams the parrot

  if you must talk then talk sense what
do you know about latitude and longitude
you ugly lump of appetite says bill

  fifty south and forty west in fathoms
from the tree croaks the bird

  if you say that again ill fetch you one
sos you wont know east from west says
bill for he was mighty hungry and in a
nasty temper i know what ill do with
you says he ill sell you to some other
fool of a sailor man you aint pretty nor
intelligent as far as i can see but you can
scream and thats something

  well he went round the dccks and at last
he sold the parrot to the cook of a coast-
ing boat called the golden vanity for six
shillings and then in a manner his luck
seemed to change for next day he got a job
unloading cargo from a tramp steamer
and thats how the riches came about

  ill tell you one day when he was work-
ing the donkey engine a crane hook caught
in bills pants and as good as ripped them
off him by good luck bill still had the
pants hed swapped the rubber plant for
so he put them on and thought no more
about it

  when dinner time came he left the ship
and was walking along the docks when he
heard someone shout-

  hi stop

  he turned round and there was a man
running after him and waving an umbrella
bill waited for the stranger to come up and
when he did he could hardly speak for want
of breath

  whats your name he says at last
thats my business bill tells him
whats yours

  brown answers the stranger

  why gasps bill then youre the man
who pawned the parrot

  and youre the man says the other
who took him out what i want to know
is-wheres that parrot

  theres lots of things you wont know


adventure

says bill getting nasty and thats one of
them

  now see here pipes up mr brown
theres no need to take offense no need
at all says he but ill give you half-a-
crown to know where that parrot is

  pass it across mate bill tells him
which he did and when bill had count-
ed the money and put it in his pocket he
tells how hed sold the parrot to the cook
of the golden vanity

  sold it great snakes you sold it
shouts the man where is this ship this
sea-cook and he starts to dance up and
down as if his feet were burning

  i dont know where she is now bill
tells him the golden vanity left port two
days ago

  well the other fellow he turns as white
as a ghost and lets out a yell and then he
clapped both hands to his head and groaned
like a man with a toothache on both sides

  was it a very valuable bird asks bill
thinking that maybe hed let it go too cheap

  valuable yells the other why that
birds worth millions hes worth his weight
in gold a hundred times over and then some
more

  i wouldnt have thought it says bill
ive never seen a more ornary looking bird
for a parrot he couldnt even talk sense
and if you say hes worth a million why
then i say youre the biggest liar between
here and hong-kong

  all right answers the stranger well
settle that afterward but now you listen to
me you gummy-backed perishin fathead
says he that parrot was descended in
a manner of speaking from captain kidd
through my great-great grandfather that
parrot knows where the pirates treasure is
hid yes sir and modestly speaking that
treasure must be worth millions in gold
got that

  i dont understand it at all says bill
it gets right past me he says

now ill tell you says this
mr brown my great-great
grandfather was one of captain
kidds pirate crew he lived to
be ninety and was the only man alive who
knew where the captain had buried all his
treasure and before he died he told the
secret to his son and made him swear hed
never write it down for fear some one might
find it

  and so it went on from father to son
each one swearing never to write the secret
down there was a sort of fate about it
too because not one of em ever succeeded
in getting to the place where it was hid
either because they hadnt enough money
or because they were married or because
they thought theyd be happier without it
at last it came to my fathers turn he was
given the secret and took the oath like the
others had done

  now my father had a mighty bad memo-
ry and for months he worried himself night
and day in case he should forget the bearings
of captain kidds treasure but at last he
hit on a plan and this was it

  he bought a parrot and he taught
this parrot the things he wanted to remem-
ber and was afraid hed forget but mark
you he wasnt going to have that bird
screaming out the secret to every one who
listened no sir he taught the bird not
to say the bearings unless a certain word
was spoken to him the directions how
far to dig south and west of a tree yes but
the latitude and longitude no not unless the
word was given he took a lot of trouble
with that bird my father did and it kept
him happy in his old age

  of course he meant to give the word to
me before he died but the old chap was
a long liver and he might be here now if he
hadnt got mixed up in a railroad accident
i wasnt with him at the time and so he
died without passing on the word

  its a rum story says bill when the
stranger looked as if hed stopped talking
but if the words lost whats the good of
the parrot

  wait a bit says this mr brown you
want to go too mighty fast says he i
was in lodgings when the parrot was handed
over to me and i was scared to death that
some one would open his cage and let him
escape while i wasnt there and so i de-
cided to pawn him for that seemed the
safest place for him while i searched through
the old mans papers to try and find the
secret word and then one day while i
was out the blamed fool of a landlady gave
you my pants with the ticket in them yes
sir and that very evening i found the word
and what was it asks bill

  thats as maybe says the stranger
but i tell you what ill do says he if
you get that parrot back for me you shall
go halves in the treasure when we find it
the bird of fortune



  that sounds pretty good says bill
now ill tell you says he the golden
vanity was bound for dover and she ought
to be there in another two or three
days if we go there by train and
board her directly she comes in i dare
say i could persuade the cook to sell the
bird back to us

  good for you says this here mr brown
well go today and not take any risks
says he

  so off they went to dover and bill
couldnt think of nothing but the treasure
and what hed do with all the money when
he got it when they got to dover they
found the golden vanity had been delayed
by bad weather and nobody couldnt say
when shed come in so they waited and
waited and at last she was sighted making
for the harbor

  my says bill shes had a proper ham-
mering she has that her bowsprits
broken and so is her fore top-mast shes
seen weather she has

  well as soon as shed made fast to a buoy
in the harbor the crew started to come
ashore in one of the boats and a pretty
battered and half-starved looking bunch
they were take my word for it for the
golden vanity had only been provisioned
for a week and shed taken nearly fifteen
days to do the trip a madder set of men

you wouldnt have found from moray firth
to the clyde by way of the channel

  bill and his partner went down to the
quay and as soon as bill saw the cook he
grabbed him

  look here says he i want that parrot
back and ill pay you what you gave me
for it

  what parrot says the cook for as
ive told you they were half-crazy with
the sufferings theyd gone through what
blinkin parrot mate says he

  why the one i sold you the one you
gave me six bob for answers bill

  and a darned poor six bobs jjprth at
that says the cook when we  ere that
hungry we couldnt stand it no longer me
and the bosun tossed for who should eat the
parrot and a mighty poor meal he made
all skin bone and feathers says he

and that remarked the sea-
faring man rising to  his feet
was the end of the parrot and
likewise of bills hopes to be-
come a millionaire but he did come
mighty near it

  tell me i said youre bill arent
you

  the seafaring man shook his head sadly

  no he said no im not bill im the
man who ate the parrot
 a i his is slim evans speaking yes

   i first lieutenant slim evans of
the army air service if ive
got the wrong number you can
ring off any time but bear in mind that
although im still broadcasting from mc-
mullen texas im not the man you used
to know

  the raggedy flyer who always was just
two jumps ahead of the sheriff financially
speaking has been displaced by a bloated
plutocrat an oil maggot so to speak i
will always be only a step or two ahead of
the law i presume in a moral manner of
speaking but at present i have no debts to
overtake me and the jailhouse will only get
me on matters like attempted manslaughter
or such diversions by this time i presume
you know me well enough to vouch for that
yourself

  anyway it was a saturday morning in
the fall of the year and i had just dis-
mounted from my trusty airplane after
having landed on the mcmullen airdrome
in a series of graceful leaps and bounds
for the benefit of any strangers who may be
listening in and who may get a mental
picture of a handsome clothes model alight-
ing dignifiedly from his airplane flicking a
speck of dust from his highly polished boots
and straightening his hundred-dollar uni-
form before he pushes up his goggles on his
leather helmet and lights a monogrammed



cigaret i will endeavor to plant my astral
eye ten feet away and watch myself get-
ting out

  behold the border patrolman who had
just finished the early morning beat along
the rio grande to laredo a tall thin
roughneck-by tall i mean several inches
over six feet and by thin i mean so little
flesh that a pimple would make this flyer
seem lopsided-crawls wearily from his cock-
pit it being a very hot day he is arrayed
in breeches and boots but above them
nothing but an undershirt this article of
apparel like his face is spattered with oil
he wears no helmet but has pushed his
goggles up on tangled windblown brown
hair which is likewise somewhat greasy
on each side of the biggest nose ever seen
short of an elephant there are two wild
looking eyes wild looking because they are
surrounded with white circles where the
goggles have protected them from the oil-
throwing liberty motor this flyer starts
plowing wearily across the sunbaked field
on large substantial flat feet followed
by his observer the honorable george
hickman

  well enough of that thats me any-
way the main point is that as soon as i
reached headquarters pop cravath our
baldheaded and excitable adjutant flipped
a telegram to me

  wire for you slim he told me so i

tabled all unfinished business and opened
the same

  it was short sweet and pregnant with
possible meanings it was from hastings
texas and it read as follows

  if humanly possible get here today vitally
important	malcolm cary

  a premonition of evil swept over me if
i recall it correctly a premonition always
sweeps doesnt it anyway i had a full-
grown premonition and it behaved as all of
the critters do

  seriously speaking i felt sort of tough
about what that telegram might mean
that oil deal of malcolms and mine in
hastings always had seemed too good to be
true somehow even if i had got twenty
thousand bucks out of it already old
adam burney was too slippery a propo-
sition for one thing and- but im getting
ahead of myself and tying myself in a knot

  i lost no more time than necessary i
cant pick up my feet and lay em down
again as easily as a man who only wears a
nine or a ten can but i made a bee-line for
the c os office and in a few seconds i had
let him read the telegram and was asking
permission to make a week-end cross coun-
try trip to the booming oil town of hastings

  stocky little cap kannard grunted rau-
cously grinned behind his cigaret and
bowed

  go ahead he chuckled ah me the
cares of wealth dont forget youre due to
sling another party soon either

  i	had given a slight soiree after getting
my first winnings from hastings and that
episode will always remain green in the
memory of mcmullenites so i said-

  any time you feel like giving the flight
a couple of days off-twenty-four hours to
reach a crisis and twenty-four to taper off-
let me know and thanks

  an hour later my shabby but efficient
de haviland gassed and oiled and my own
person washed polished and highly per-
fumed i was roaring along on my way to
hastings across far-sweeping mesquite that
seemed as though it never would end it
was a hundred and fifty miles or a little
more and most of the trip was over that
desert of chaparral it was a course to make
a pilot glue his good eye on his instruments

  while the trusty bomber is galloping
along at a hundred miles or so an hour
northeastward to the oilfield i may as well

take your mind off the trip by letting you
on the inside of what i thought that tele-
gram might perhaps maybe possibly mean

ii

jgqggp maybe you remember malcolm
cary hes an old friend of
 jgjbiljgp mine anyway when i met him
 owned a little mine back of
el paso surrounded by hills he had a lot
of border bums working for him and was
having a hard time to keep his head above
water sleepy spears one of the mcmullen
flyers and i dropped in one week-end just
in time to help him out of a lot of trouble
with his men just luck-we bulled around
awkwardly and happened to bump up
against the right solution of the whole
shindig

  malcolm was pretty grateful particu-
larly after a representative of some big
eastern firm dropped up to hightown one
day and bought the whole mine for fifty
thousand bucks in cash money malcolm
felt that hed have been bumped off or gone
into bankruptcy if it hadnt have happened
that sleepy and i helped him out and i
guess he was right

  a bit later malcolm heard from a friend
of his in hastings latest and greatest of the
texas oilpools a wildcat well was going
down several miles south of hastings some
distance from where the pool was located
and in territory which was supposed to be
dry of oil however the expert oil man
who was drilling figured there was a chance
the pool might extend that far

  this friend of malcolms named iligh-
heels blake was in a position to get inside
information on how the formation was show-
ing up as the well went down and also to
get a sample of the core when they took it
the core is simply a sample of sand which
they take when down to the proper depth
and by chemical analysis-sometimes by
even smelling it-one can tell whether
theres oil there or not not how much
of course but whether the well is going to
be absolutely dry or not blake suggested
that if his information showed that buying
acreage around that well looked like a good
investment malcolm use his money to do it
and that they split fifty fifty

  it was a good proposition for this reason
old man howard a rich crusty old ex-cat-
tleman of houston owned over five hundred


adventure

acres around that well-practically had it
surrounded-and he held his acreage at a
prohibitive price prohibitive until the well
came in if ever around a hundred and
fifty an acre it would have been madness
for any man to gamble that much until he
was-certain there was oil there con-
sequently there were no buyers but that
wildcat well called blake number i was
watched with much interest

  malcolm feeling that he owed sleepy
and me something made this offer and we
snapped it up pronto if blake said go
ahead and buy hed invest five thousand
apiece for sleepy and me in sections of
that acreage taking the rest himself

  if we made money we paid it back out of
our profits if blake number i after look-
ing good enough to justify buying fliwered
and we lost that jack sleepy and i were to
pay the five thousand back at the rate of
fifty a month per each out of our salary
this arrangement took the proposition
down to a mere friendly loan and conse-
sequently we didnt feel like beggars or
objects of charity

  sleepy was on leave so cary and i
went down there to hastings and finally
we grabbed off that howard acreage after
fighting everybody in hastings for it every
lease-hound and big company man scared to
pay that amount for acreage before almost
knowing there was oil there was snooping
around trying to get dope by hook or crook

  the most powerful of them was old
adam burney a multimillionaire oil gam-
bler whod made the hastings field and
made himself a fortune doing it he had
hastings in the hollow of his hand from the
sheriff right on down through and he tried
to beat us by every method known to man
crooked and straight he was scared of
malcolm because malcolms a big drawling
texan whos well known around the border
as a two-fisted fighter whos bad to fool
with

  burney went so far as to frame malcolm
and get him out of the way in jail so that
burney would have a free hand but finally
i got the dope on the well and the end of
it was that i used my airplane to beat
burneys right hand man into houston to
grab the acreage burneys man used an
airplane too-a civilian passenger-carrying
ship run by a fellow named malley

  well then we were in possession of five
hundred acres offset from blake number x

which was flowing two thousand barrels
a day and burney seemed to hold no
grudge against us-as is the way of the
oilfields all is fair in a race for acreage and
when a mans beaten he takes it philosoph-
ically

  and then burney came along with the
best offer for our acreage-better than we
had from the big company men who wanted
to buy burney wanted to do what he had
done before on acreage around hastings-
gamble big and win more

  he paid us three hundred thousand dol-
lars for the howard acreage and in addi-
tion to this price we were to share half and

half with him on all net profit made above
this amount his method was to sink wells
on his own capital all around the tract and
after proving how much oil there was under
it sell out

  its a good scheme if you hit its one
thing to say that five hundred acres next to
a paying well has probably got oil under it-
and another thing to actually have a few
paying wells on it in different places the
big companies are always willing to pay
more in proportion for proved acreage than
for acreage which is merely offset from pay
territory a pool has got to end some-
where-sometimes therell be a gusher on
one tract and a dry hole not two hundred
yards away from it

  this scheme made us almost partners of
burney and it was strengthened by the
fact that he had such an admiration for
malcolm cary and upton who had drilled

  main pool

wells wells wells



blake number  that he made malcolm
general manager of the company to exploit
the howard acreage and put upton in
charge of all field operations

you see where this left us-
in partnership with one of the
most powerful unscrupulous
and crooked oil kings in the mid-
continent field but we felt that it was the
right thing to do for two reasons one hed
made the best offer from a financial view-
point and we stood to make a lot more
money by stringing along with him sec-
ondly brethren we had suspended over
him by a hair a large and heavy rock which
we could bring tumbling down on his grace-
less gray head at any moment to crush him
if he tried any of the well-known burney
bludgeoning on us

  in attempting to put us out of com-
petition for the howard acreage hed been
crooked as a corkscrew as ive said even
going to the length of planting some dope
in my ship having the sheriff find it and
trying to put us both away for peddling
narcotics

  he could get away with stuff like that as
ive said because hed made hastings and
ran it right down to the ground but in
beating the old scoundrel wed found out a
lot about him through confessions of some
of his underlings and we felt that any time
he tried to new york us hed remember that
all we had to do was open our mouths and
break forth into a rash of speech-and then
old adam burney would find himself looking
at the world from the wrong side of chastely
beautiful bars so we took a chance

but somehow or other after i
got that wire from cary i felt
uneasy no telling what funny
dodge burney might have worked
out to beat us out of our shares of a tremen-
dous deal my share wasnt big of course
my borrowed five thousand made me a
partner in a little less than fifty acres of
the whole tract but if im beat out of so
much as a nickel ill squeal so loud that
people think theres an abattoir starting
somewhere in town

  and i figured that somehow burney must
have worked out a scheme to high-hat
malcolm and me without getting in trouble
himself whenever malcolm calls on me
ive found out from bitter experience there

is trouble in the offing did i say bitter
experience thats a misnomer no ex-
perience which has elements of excitement
can be called bitter why try to kid you
and myself trouble is one of the priceless
sectors of this monotonous existence it
helps to kill time as some bright english-
woman once announced for those that pre-
fer it dead

ill

if you have survived all this hot
air ive been spilling gaze down
on hastings as i spiraled down
above it it made me catch my
breath every time i saw it from the air
northward from the surging crowded hys-
terical boom town itself stretched a forest of
derricks the whole field was a gaunt un-
beautiful oil-soaked wilderness-even the
few mesquite trees drooped blackly smeared
with oil

  thousands of men were working under
the hot sun and the crude roads which
crisscrossed the territory were alive with
every type of vehicle the pipelines grid-
ironed the whole tract and the cone-
shaped unpainted derricks stretched starkly
toward the sky

  ill quit describing here ive run out of
words not being a cross-word puzzle fan
take one look at a used-to-be country vil-
lage which has been augmented by crude
shacks tents and booths until every inch of
space between and around the permanent
buildings has been used up and the streets
of which are literally packed with a seeth-
ing excited money-mad mob of crooks
roughnecks lease-hounds drillers and big
company men and you have the panorama

  from a panorama it may be a sleeper
jump to ex-corporal malley but as soon as
i turned my eyes from the field itself and
gazed down at the pasture lot which malley
had made into a flying field for his little
ninety-horse-power jenny i spotted the
corporal he was accompanied by only
one man and they were lying in the shade
of the superannuated plane

  i had landed at that field twice before of
course but this was special because i
hadnt seen malley since the night when my
de haviland and i beat this jenny and
burneys man into houston by very strong
methods since malcolm and i had been
fought with every known brand of fire and
brimstone wed used a bit of the same


adventure

in making certain that we were first into
houston i figured that maybe malley
might have something to say about it

  he did plenty of bad news caballeros
a great sufficiency

  i dropped my big ton-and-a-half de havi-
land across the fence found out that i was
going entirely too fast and fishtailed it with
the rudder so hard that it was traveling
sideways like a trotting dog most of the way
across the field

  i finally set her down on three points but
the motor was idling too fast and she went
like blazes i cut the switches and did a
ground loop which is simply a fast turn on
the ground and after dipping my right
wing-skid into the ground i finally brought
up safely covered with dust and filled with
disgust

  i caught the motor while the prop was
still turning thus automatically cranking it
and taxied her around parallel with mal-
leys oil-spattered saggy-wired discouraged
looking crate

  i had no sooner run out the gas and
brought the twelve-cylinder liberty to a
well-earned rest than malley hove along-
side accompanied by a stout bloated un-
shaven man dressed in a white shirt baggy
black trousers and a sailor straw hat which
was much the worse for wear he hadnt
shaved apparently since the year of the
big fog and his whole appearance was that
of a man who had tried to drown himself in a
sea of alcohol and had lost his nerve just be-
fore he finished the job

  well this is a surprize-a really delight-
ful surprize said ex-corporal malley
there was a smite on his triangular face
somewhat resembling the charming grin of a
cat as it takes another bat at a crippled
mouse

  its mutual i told him as i offered him
a selection of crushed cigarets

  malley had been a corporal in the air
service during the war and when i first lit
in hastings with a loud thump hed called
my name although i didnt know him he
was trying to make a go of carrying pas-
sengers in hastings but it was no go be-
cause he was a rotten flyer in the first place
and had a rotten-literally speaking-out-
fit in the second he always looked sloppy
and dirty and ill-cared-for and his ship took
after him his face was rather peculiar-
his forehead was very high and broad and
his cheekbones high from there on down

his face fell away in three directions from
each side and from the front backward j
his chin ended in a point and it receded
like an ocean when the tides going out his
skin was dark from a combination of the
sun and dirt he looked so unwashed that
i had the feeling that if hed actually scrub
himself hard hed probably come to another
pair of socks or something

meet mr graham malley
went on and it seemed as though
he was trying to put deep signifi-
cance into every word

  glad to know you i told the other man

  then remembering the name i took the
bull by the horns and went on

  arent you the fellow who was malleys
passenger when we had that little race into
houston a couple of months back for the
howard acreage i mean

  yeah and you guys shot the prop
right offn my ship flyin at night and all
malley started vindictively

  sure we did but we didnt shoot you
and there were good fields underneath and
a bright moon i told him

  meanwhile i was looking at the drink-
sodden graham in utter amazement it
didnt seem possible that this could be
burneys right hand man the messenger he
had sent to close a big deal for him and the
man who was reputed to personally handle
burneys largest deals for him

  well that theres gonna be an expensive
little trip fur you lieutenant stated mal-
ley his small eyes wavering from my face

  why i snapped him up cary paid
you for your prop didnt he

  sure but thats got nothing to do with
it malley told me

  graham stood there without saying a
word his incongruous straw hat propped
down over his eyes malley occasionally
stole a look at him as though for approval
and a fresh store of courage

  why hasnt it i demanded

  because theres a lot more cornin to us
than the price of a prop

  why us  i enquired with a glance
at graham

  never you mind said malley in some
confusion apparently hed slipped a cog
in including graham but youre a rich
man now you damaged me far moren a
propeller means and its gonna cost yuh
just twenty five thousand bucks
wells wells wells 



  just like that

  i did three mental tailspins and my back
hair waved gently with surprize then i
gathered myself together collected what
few spare thoughts i had laying around and
finally cranked up my tongue and went into
high

  listen i commanded the greasy cor-
poral trying to hold his attention with a
keen and glittering eye so youre up to
blackmail eh well remember this i
dont know just how deeply you were con-
cerned in the plot burney hatched against
malcolm cary and i and i dont give a
- despite the fact that were part-
ners in a manner of speaking of burneys
now at that time we were competitors and
he fought crookedly

  by crooked work on his part you and
graham were miles ahead of us to start on
that race for houston and when we shot
you down out of the air we were fighting
fire with fire and you know it so pipe
down malley get your feet on the ground
and for-s sake dont talk like an ama-
teur thug

  is that so sneered the unwashed un-
shaven and unshorn graham speaking in
a husky voice pretty sure of yoreself
aint yuh

 youre-right i am

  here the weasel-like malley seemed to
find new concrete to pour into his back-
bone so to speak and started to get nasty
forthwith

  it certainly was providential you drop-
pin in this way he told me unpleasantly
layin aside any arguments you may have
the cold fact is this you aint got no proof
i was in with burney at all as a matter of
fact i wasnt i was just a hired chauffeur
tuh carry graham here tuh houston in my
own ship you come along and shoot me
down out o the air at night damagin my
property endangerin my life and my pas-
sengers and so on and if you think i cant

make it-good an hot fur you both in

and out o the army and make yuh dance
until twenty-five thousandll seem like a
cent dropped in a well youre badly mis-
taken

  ill sue yuh fur every brand o damages
a smart lawyer can think of and ill put you
up fur court-martial in the army and ill
plaster somethin on your property tuh
make it a cinch i can collect and in general
have you hoppin around like a hen on a

hot griddle with the sure prospect o payin
through the nose at the end

  well fellow worms there were consider-
able sectors of sense in his brief remarks
the creed of the oil fields unwritten but
nevertheless widely lived up to is to take
your medicine and say nothing but if
malley wanted to be nasty there was no
proof that i knew of that he was anything
but a hired man for that trip

  true enough he had guarded my ship for
me when burneys representative had
planted the dope in it but that worthy had
distinctly stated that malley was not in the
plot at all it all came down to the point
that malley could make it-uncomfort-
able for me malcolm had paid him five
hundred dollars in cash for his propeller and
inconvenience which was five times what
the damage was worth-but that item about
endangering his life and property would go
big with a jury especially inasmuch as i
was reputed wealthy

  finally i said-

  is this twenty-five thousand supposed
to come from me personally or from cary
upton and i as a combination

  from the three of yuh or any way yuh
want to work it

  i stood and looked at him for a moment
and then at his unsavory and mysterious
companion mysterious because of his be-
ing here and his condition it was incon-
gruous to see the mythical graham doer of
big things for the oil king of the midcon-
tinent field fraternizing with malley as it
would have been to see john d rockefeller
roughnecking on one of his own wells

  there was an item that made my gorge
rise slowly and which knocked out of me
any sympathetic ideas i may have had
things having turned out as they had we
didnt owe malley a cent ethically speaking
wed paid him four hundred net for
making an easy forced landing

  but i might have fallen for a few dollars
to him if it had not been for the fact that
both of em were so plainly trying to get
away with something in the blackmail line
and they were very unprepossessing in
their manner of demanding it right away
i froze up on em and the whole business
gave me a faint sensation of nausea so i
broke into fairly forthright speech

  as a matter of fact my net profit so far
on my little bit of a slice of acreage is only
fifteen thousand dollars but if it was
	adventure

fifteen million im not falling for blackmail-
ing from a couple of weasels like you two

i dont know where you come in on this
graham or why but im telling you both

this you can sue and do your-est both

of you you can drag me into court and
make me hire a lawyer and all the rest of it
but ill spend all ive got to save myself
from paying a nickel to a pair of dirty black-
mailers and when the case finally gets up
to the judge hell probably consider the fact
that both of you were working for a man
thatd used illegal methods against us-
and if necessary that same manll proba-
bly testify to that same effect so go ahead
and be-to you

  whereupon i left em flat and went over
to the ship to unwire my suitcase which
was parked on one wing close to the fuse-
lage i heard no words acrimonious or
otherwise emanating from my two antago-
nists

as i was working on the wires i
heard the sound of an automo-
bile motor and looked around to
discover malcolm cary and his
new fiancee in his new car i expected that
malley and graham retired into the back-
ground and watched like a couple of buz-
zards while malcolm brought his shiny blue
eight-cylinder wagon to a stop right along-
side the dh

  i dragged the suitcase over while answer-
ing various and sundry greetings from both
of them cary was one of those huge
gentle drawling texans who act and talk
like lambs and turn into human tornadoes
at the slightest provocation or none what-
ever

  he weighed over two hundred and looked
a bit fat until one discovered that his flesh
was hard as a rock his full-moon face
ordinarily beamed comfortably at the whole
wide world when he got mad one huge
paw would stroke his thin brown hair slow-
ly and his gray eyes would grow smaller as
the flesh gathered around them his whole
face would sort of tighten at times like that

  as for his bride-to-be-she was a breath-
taking damsel whom we had both met soon
after our arrival in hastings owing to the
fact that we bunked at her mothers house
she was as small as malcolm was large
they looked like the mountain and the
mouse together he could have worn her
set in a signet ring she was bobbed-haired

and big-eyed and possessed that rare qual-
ity in women-frank straightforward un-
affected sincerity she never acted coy
or anything else which she wasnt when
she was pleased she showed it and when she
liked a man she didnt try to hide it i will
be frank and state here and now that when
i began to know her at first she caused my
heart to do several skips some cavortings
and a flutter or two

  to what do we owe the honor of this
visit slim drawled malcolm as he lighted
a homemade cigaret before starting

  dont kid me i admonished him
whats up

  why nothing particular he said in
some surprize you knew that the third
corner well had come in for only five hun-
dred barrels and the fourth one and the
one in the middle aint down tuh the sand

yet-

  sure but then why the wire

  what wire he queried turning in the
front seat to gaze into my open optics

  the wire you sent me saying to come
right over-important and all that stuff

  slim i didnt send yuh any wire what-
ever sugar have i been in my right
mind

  mary-her name was mary baker-slid
her hand over on his big paw smiled and
then looked at me with a slight shadow in
her eyes evidently she sensed a new
complication-and well she knew what some
complications in the oil fields meant

  i took a few seconds to digest his state-
ment and then i told him word for word
what the wire had said i couldnt be mis-
taken of course it had been sent from
hastings and it was signed malcolm cary
then without pause i narrated my inter-
view with malley and graham

  do you suppose they sent that wire just
to get me here i asked oratorically as we
crawled over the rutty road toward town
i cant believe it with you and upton
on the ground they wouldnt have wired me
but would have started off on you by the
way where does graham fit in

  burney fired im malcolm said suc-
cinctly looking at him from a southwest
angle i could see that fleshy face of his
tightening he scented trouble

  after burney took me and upton on
graham got kind o sore pulled a couple o
bones then got drunk one night an he an
wells wells wells



the old man went tuh the mat and graham
got fired since then hes been conductin
a contest all his own tuh see whether he can
drink up booze fastern the stills can make
it and hes been gainin i hear

  we rode silently a while both trying to
figure things out it seemed a funny situ-
ation seemed as though malley or gra-
ham must have sent that wire-and yet for
what possible reason they could have
started on the other two men and a wire
signed with carys name seemed a crazy
subterfuge

  mary said nothing but seemed to sort of
curl up in the front seat close to malcolm as
though she was comforted by his presence
shed been in on the somewhat lurid events
indigenous to the procurement of the how-
ard acreage and i guess she was somewhat
worried about her brand-new and unused
fiance

  finally malcolm broke the silence and
his words as usual under conditions of that
sort were unusually gentle and spaced at
even wider intervals than usual from one
word to another was a toll call

somethins up somewhere
and i aint shore burney aint at
the bottom of it he said

 theres some-good rea-
son on somebodys part for callin yuh heuh
but what it can be i dont know with me
and upton on the ground and you holdin
only a small share but burneys been
actin real worried and peculiar like
slim

  i aint sorry yore here you seem tuh
be one o those birds that thrive on trouble
so fars i can see and now that yore here i
aim tuh have a showdown an see what them
hints the old mans been thowin out mean
well likewise interview the telegraph oper-
ators an see who sent that there billet doux
and in general try tuh see where we stand

blackmail from one side and-knows

what from the other

  however he concluded if yuh play
with snakes yore bound tuh get bit i
reckon

  which was what i was thinking through
force of necessity we were hooked up one
way or another with a crooked gang or
a gang that had been crooked and probably
would be again it was our own funeral
but it left kind of a bad taste in my mouth

  you may say we had no business getting

   

mixed up with em well business is busi-
ness and what theyd done in the past or
would do again was none of our business as
long as our private affairs were run straight
maybe youd give up a bunch of jack rather
than string with a man like burney not me

  but then whats the use of talking about
it thats the way things sat im no dea-
con in the baptist church and no model
for little lord fauntleroy at the best and i

dont give a-what you think about it

one way or the other

iv

it seemed to me as we
crawled down that thronged main
street that hastings was even
more crowded than it had been
before if that was possible wed come to
hastings when it seemed that the town was
on the crest of the wave and then our new
pool south of town had opened up like
magic

  trading had been slowing down on the
pool north of town because the big com-
panies had practically tied it up and all
outlying acreage had finally reached just
about its top price but our purchase of the
howard tract with three producing wells
already flowing down there had stimulated
the madness anew

  just picture a rutted wide main street
practically solid with cars trucks wagons
even an ox team or two sidewalks packed
with humanity of every kind and descrip-
tion but a majority leaning toward the
typical oil specimen street lined with
stores saloons gambling and dance halls
and everybody as nervous as a man invited
to make himself comfortable in the electric
chair

  flaunting signs indicated the locations of
lease exchanges and every ten feet some-
body was trying to sell acreage which theyd
probably just leased to somebody else at a
higher price big company well-scouts and
land men held court here and there acting
bored as they talked in the hundreds of
thousands

  prostitutes rough-necks lease-hounds
hijackers pickpockets brokers-every type
was represented every store had its doors
wide open and every one was packed
temporary booths selling everything from
hot dogs to lemonade had customers lined
up four deep in front
adventure

  it was an overstimulated overwrought
abnormal scene and even a bird like me
who on the average wouldnt spend a dollar
to see the johnstown flood with the original
broadway cast felt the resistless pull and
stimulation of it made me restless and
before i knew it my nose was sniffing the
air longing to get on the scent of something
or other i didnt know what or where or
why

  we got a lot of greetings being men who
had supposedly put over one of the biggest
single deals of the hastings pool the fact
that we still owned the howard acreage
kept us in the public eye-thered been a
thousand fortunes made and lost since id
been in hastings last

  we finally curved off down the side-
street where marys comfortable old-fash-
ioned home sat in aged dignity and dropped
her off then we sort of circled the north
edge of town between the village and the
first pool on our way to burneys house
we got about half-way when i suggested
late as usual that it would be an excellent
thing if we interviewed the people in the
telegraph office first no telling what we
might unearth

  so we back-tracked parked the car on a
sidestreet and held converse with every
one of the five clerks in the office including
the manager the girl who had taken the
telegram that morning couldnt remember
who sent it except very vaguely

  she thought he was pretty well-dressed
and wore glasses and was fairly young
she finally thought that perhaps maybe she
might be right when she seemed to remem-
ber that he wore a sailor straw hat to be
brief we didnt find out anything that we
could go on much except that neither mal-
ley graham or burney all of whom were
known by sight to every one in the office
had been in it that morning

  so that was that as we once more
started leaping from bump to bump on the
cut-up road to burneys house i summed up
my feelings in the matter

  it must have been malley behind it-
or burney chances are malley although
why in the name of all thats good and holy
he should sign your name to a telegram or
have some one else do it for him to get me
here i dont know incidentally as soon
as were through with burney i want a
couple of your roughnecks to guard my
ship malleys on the loose im afraid

and furthermore what are we going to do
about this twenty-five grand

  lets talk to burney first-if we can find
him suggested malcolm

  we were lucky in finding the gentleman
as we turned into the driveway which cir-
cled up to his ornate white mansion we
spotted the old twenty-minute egg sitting
on the porch that was the spot where our
first historic interview with him had taken
place this time though he was not ac-
companied by his stunning young wife

      he greeted us with a wave
of the hand and below his fierce
white mustache his lips were
efcfc curved in a smile he was dressed
as was his almost invariable custom in a
spotless palm beach suit and a huge pan-
ama chapeau was doing duty as a fan he
was a big impressive looking man despite
heavy jowls a rather hard face and prom-
inent bloodshot eyes below iron-gray hair

  ever since malcolm upton and i in
combination had beaten him on that deal
hed apparently had a vast admiration for
the ability of my two confreres as i men-
tioned somewhere else in this poem the
company he organized to exploit the how-
ard acreage had malcolm as general man-
ager and upton-the best oil man in the
midcontinent field when he was sober-
as field chief in charge of all drilling

  come up the old fellow invited us
hello lieutenant thought i seen your
ship this mornin hows tricks malcolm
my boy

  not what they might be returned the

texan gently

  so whats the matter i was out to
the field this mornin and dewey said bur-
ney number  was lookin fine jackson
of the texas offered me eight hundred and
fifty thousand dollars for the works just as
they sit but i told him wed prove every
inch o that territory and make im pay
through the nose

   were willin says he but dont wait
too long oil runs out yuh know 
wed better sell when that number 
comes in-if she does stated malcolm
no s of course too but that ought tuh be
in a couple o days now we cant do no
more than tuh prove theres oil on all four
corners and in the middle can we

  no and a cool millionll just about be
the melon we cut so whats bitin yuh
wells wells wells

  just this stated malcolm and in a few
well-chosen words he told the old million-
aire about the telegram and likewise about
the little social chat between graham
malley and i

  now listen mr burney and dont git
insulted too quick cary went on his eyes
boring into our hosts yuhve been
throwin out a few remarks the last few days
which didnt sit so well with me we all
know yore methods in the past but we
figured you wouldnt work none of yore
crooked stuff on us because we got some-
thin on yuh what do you know about
this here telegram what do yuh know about
where graham is sittin on this particular
deal-and just where in-are you sit-
uated yoreself

  burney pulled his moustache rumina-
tively then he spoke in that rasping
voice of his

  i dont blame yuh none he stated
fact o the matters this graham hadnt
been so good for a couple o months before
he tied up with you boys and got licked
when i put you and upton in on the new
company he got soreheaded finally got
drunk and tried to argue with me and i
fired im

  then he made some threats gonna
hold me up because hed pulled off a few
deals fur me and thought he was on the
inside had me worried right bad fur a
while didnt know which way tuh turn
then i got somethin so definite on him
that ive shut his trap forever thats
where he sat and thats where hes sittin
now-a busted flush against three full
houses

  how do you account for trying to
blackmail us out of twenty-five thousand
on account o that shootin demanded
malcolm

  thats malley i interposed gra-
hams just working through him malley
slipped in letting me know graham was in
on it nobodys got any way of con-
trolling malley have they

  except through graham said burney

  and what you do to graham wouldnt
stop malley i pointed out malley
could work alone-and weve got nothing
on him have we

  he was just hired to make that trip
burney agreed

  what about planting that heroin en-
quired malcolm when blake planted it

in our ship under yore orders malley was

supposed to be watchin the ship-

  but blake distinctly said that he planted
it and according to him malley wasnt in on
it i reminded him

  no reason why we couldnt git blake
tuh say that malley did know about it
suggested the old reprobate

  no but ill be-if id do that i

said flatly im ready to be sick being
mixed up with a lot of double-crossing
blackmailing framing crooks anyway

maybe wed be justified but ill be-

if ill get low enough to-

  me neither drawled malcolm

  right there i fixed my rolling eyes on
burney i am a forthright and crude apple-
knocker from the wilds of utah unversed in
subtlety or kindred smooth and suave and
slippery devices and in my present con-
dition of deep disgust i came to bat heavily

  all this doesnt clear up the mystery of
that fake telegram i said talking to bur-
ney maybe malley was the cause of it
but why if he wanted to get into com-
munication with me he didnt need to use
malcolms name and if he did send it for
purposes of getting me near-by to blackmail
hed have had no scruples about telling me
this morning that he had done it burney
are you responsible for that wire calling me
here and if so why

  no roared burney

  now listen i went on waving a long
and horny and oil-stained forefinger to add
emphasis burney i know your record
and i know what you tried to do to us
were all in a mess together right now but
that doesnt alter the fact that i dont
trust you as far as i could blow the rock of
gibraltar by taking a deep breath the
only thing that keeps me from being
absolutely certain that you are behind it is
that i cant figure any reason on earth why
anybody on earth should want me in hast-
ings for crooked or straight purposes im
inclined to think youre up to something

and if you are-

  what the- dyuh mean bellowed

burney his fleshy face purple and his
bloodshot eyes wild as the sea on a stormy

night by--

  he got hold of himself then and it surely
was an effort he looked from malcolms
set face to mine and piped down

  i cant blame yuh lieutenant but it
aint so he said with a certain amount


adventure

 of dignity ive fought my way from a
 beggar to a millionaire by bein tougher an
 harder an-crookeder than anybody else in
 these stinkin fields but i got mine im
 swingin a big deal with you boys and im
  playin straight im not bellyachin or
 yappin about reformin-id do all ive
 done over again fur the same reasons-but
 in this case im tellin yuh whats right i
 dont know whats afoot on all these fake
 wires and this and that but the burney-
 howard development company includes
 me and yuh can count on me-hello whos
 this

           the abrupt transition called our
 enthralled attention to a battered
 mud-covered taxi which was now
  <=>- fanning and fogging up the drive-
 way to the accompaniment of divers groans
 rattles and wheezes there was one man in
 the back seat and he alighted in front of
 the porch steps told the driver to wait and
 then turned toward us

    sorry to bother you gentlemen but i
 have important business with mr burney
 he said easily i presume sir that you
 are mr adam burney president of the
 burney-howard development company
 uh huh grunted the old man and
 this heres cary my general manager fur
 that company and lieutenant evans a
 stockholder

   im fortunate to have found you all
 here said our visitor he came up the
 steps carrying what looked like a map
 under his arm

    he was a tall rather slender fellow who
 looked to be around thirty-five his face
 was thin and curiously impressive his
 forehead was but little wider than his
 square jaw and his whole face was in a sort
 of straight-line effect his mouth was a
 straight thin gash across his face and his
 eyebrows and eyes were parallel to his
 mouth if you get me just as level as
 could be and at an exact right angle to a
 long thin straight nose the corners of
 his mouth did not turn either down or up
 nor was there the slightest curve in his eye-
 brows his cheeks were lean with high
 cheekbones and his eyes were a piercing
 blue and his hair and eyebrows black he
 was very neatly dressed in a tweed suit and
 panama hat he looked to be a very cool
 competent incisive individual

    he did not sit down but leaned against

the porch railing facing us he took out a
silver cigaret case offered us smokes and
lit one himself then he said

  gentlemen im an oil man ive been
down in the tampico field for two years
and have made some money im on my
way east on other business now and stopped
off here a few days ago to see what i could
see my name is craig-robert c craig
he looked at us as though he expected
that wed recognize his name i wouldnt
naturally but burney might being an oil
man but all that burney said was-
what can we do fur yuh mr craig
make a deal with me said that gentle-
man in his level deep voice i looked
around here got the lay of the land and
then got busy i heard about what you
were doing and decided id like to horn in
with you to our mutual advantage lay-
ing aside false humility im as good an oil
man-in the sense of knowing acreage and
its value and putting it across-as youll
be likely to find im not blowing im
stating a fact

  he unrolled his map

  heres a blueprint of the acreage south
of the river he said spreading a map which
looked something like this

  now all these tracts on the eastern and
southern fringe of your acreage are in small
blocks as you know the whole thing
totals some hundred and sixty acres
originally they were owned by a large num-
ber of different people and of course ever
since your blake number  came in trading
has been almost hysterical in them most
of them have been re-leased five and six
times

  thats right nodded burney and mal-
colm agreed by saying nothing i could
see the huge texan was watching our curt
businesslike visitor with a great deal of
interest

  now due to the fact that this land is
broken up so much-so many different
owners-the big company men havent gone
to the trouble of trying to buy any of it to
date waiting to get your acreage i pre-
sume the texas has already stepped in
on the western edge and got around seven
hundred acres as you know after they
get your stuff then they can try to get all
these small owners to sell to em but natur-
ally they wont bother with ten acres here
and twenty there they want the whole
shebang or nothing
wells wells wells



  shore well what about it

  burney was sunk low in his chair pulling
his moustache and devoting his exclusive
attention to craig the old man was all
business now and was watching and listen-
ing as though his life depended on what was
coming

  well now were right down to bed-
rock stated craig ive inquired around
and used my eyes i know your system in
the past mr burney and what youre
doing now youre proving your acreage
to get a larger proportionate price for it than
as though you sold without drilling in
brief i decided that i could make money
for myself and for you if i could swing a
big deal so i gambled mr burney i
now own this hundred and sixty acres offset
from your acreage on the eastern and
southern fringe i got all the owners to
sell to me and i spent a lot of money now
i want to make a deal with you or your
company rather to take over this hundred
and sixty acres add it to your holdings
and handle it as you are handling the
howard acreage

  you say yuh got that hundred and sixty
acres solid demanded burney

  lock stock and barrel stated craig
i can prove that titles are clear etc my
lawyer and i will naturally demonstrate
that to your satisfaction

if yuh gathered that there acreage and
didnt pay too much yore an oil man all
right stated burney and a gambler
maybe admitted craig now heres
my proposition

  i like your method of handling acreage
i believe that you mr burney by adding
this hundred and sixty acres to your hold-
ings can get a bigger price for it when you
finally close out to the big companies than
i could individually so i want to throw
in with you as an oil man i believe theres
a pool thatll knock your eye out right there
south of the river your four flowing wells
are averaging around fifteen hundred bar-
rels a day-and therell be bigger ones

  dont forget that your biggest well
blake number  here-is closest to my
hundred and sixty acres too i paid plenty
for my acreage but i make this proposition
-being as you said a gambler ill sell
you this hundred and sixty to be added to
your acreage and handled just as you handle
your original five hundred for fifty thousand
dollars cash to bind the bargain you

agree to drill one well in the middle of this
acreage to prove it as you are proving the
howard tract when you sell the whole
tract-mine and the howard acreage-
itll be at a certain price per acre out of
what my hundred and sixty sells for on a
pro rata basis you deduct the fifty thousand
plus the expense of drilling the well the
net expense after deducting from the cost
of the well the value of the oil which
has flowed from it before you sell this
will clear you of your investment of the
net profit-from the oil which has flowed
and the selling price-you get twenty-five
per cent and i get seventy-five naturally
you cant lose-the hundred and sixty cant
sell for less than youll have spent i
simply have come to the conclusion that
seventy-five per cent of what you make out
of it will total more than a hundred per cent
of what i make out of it particularly in view
of the fact that ive got to be in the east for
the next couple of months and cant stay
here to look after things myself

  burney didnt hesitate an instant he
turned to malcolm

  a good proposition he stated

  almost too good drawled malcolm
  burney turned to craig

  its a deal-if yuh can live up to yore
part of it

  good said craig smilingly gathering
up his map the quicker it goes through
the better my lawyer is here-going east
with me-and has handled the papers for all
the buys ive made if i can id like to
leave here tonight suppose we say that
you and your lawyer meet my lawyer and
myself at the imperial hotel at two-thirty
oclock this afternoon in room  ill
have all the papers ready-my leases to the
land and the contract between yourselves
and me your lawyer can look them over
and we can sign on the dotted lines without
delay a certified check for fifty thousand
will be all right

  thank you gentlemen i trust that
the deal will be mutually profitable i
personally am delighted is two-thirty
convenient i would like to get the four
oclock train if i could

  all right nodded burney but yore
workin pretty fast better be shore yore
papers are in good shape if yuh want tuh
run it through that quick

  my lawyers a hound smiled craig
being from tampico he knows the oil
adventure

business dont think i bought an acre
that had any cloud on it from the original
title right on through every previous lease
good day gentlemen

  as the taxi rattled on down the driveway
malcolm grinned

  pretty snappy hombre and hes handin
us somethin he opined

  well be that as it may im still thinking
of why im here and what malleys going to
do i stated he could make it right
unhandy for me

  bein as were bloated with money and
all and tuh save trouble maybe wed bet-
ter grease im some said burney that

there shootin proposition-

  im going to see him again right now
and see what i can do i decided i
wont pay blackmail it keeps on forever
and even if it doesnt i wont stand for it
malley was well paid for his trouble and by

-that dirty bum isnt going to hold me

up-not if i was worth a million dollars
ill let him shoot his wad i guess mal-
colm wherell i meet you when i get
through

  suppose you drift up to the imperial at 
two-thirty said cary three cooks are
bettern two

  and too many heads spoil the broth i
quoted or misquoted or at any rate said
ill see this bozo alone and see what i can
shake out of him you can carry me as far
as town malcolm and then ill taxi on
out id give several new-mown whiskers to

know what the-is up around this town

-and what malley knows ill prod out of
him if i have to hypnotize him with a brick

v

lllrtffi   happened that i didnt
have to go on out to the field as
jul malcolm and i were tooling our
mn way down the street in his car we
were close to the row of parked cars along
one side and just by chance my eagle eye
spotted the greasy features of mr malley
in front of the imperial hotel this im-
posing hostelry was a frame building set
back a few feet from the street and had
porches on both stories running the full
length of the front what had been a
small lawn in front of it was now concealed
by booths facing the street and behind them
chairs filled the whole space many mil-
lion dollars had swapped owners in those

chairs for here the big company men were
wont to receive those who had land to sell
you had to stand in line to get a seat

  see you at two-thirty i yelped to
cary and dove out of the car

  as i squeezed through between two
parked cars malley spotted me over the
heads of the passing populace its no
harder to pick me out of the crowd than it
would be to notice the statue of liberty in
a toy store

  ive been looking around for you
malley told me directly i didnt have a
chance t tell yuh that im shakin this burg
at four oclock this afternoon fur san anto-
nio and when i get there the funll start if
y dont come across

  come here i said and dragged him
into an alley a few feet from the sidewalk

  why didnt cary stop he inquired
hes in on it aint he he shot my prop

off from your ship-

  ill talk for the three i announced
now you listen a minute why did you
have a fake telegram sent to me signed by
cary

  huh

  he seemed utterly astounded id tried
to take him off-guard but the result
coupled with the fact that the telegraph
companys clerk was positive that he had
not been in the office and that there was no
sense in the idea anyway made me put mal-
ley entirely out of my calculations as far as
that wire went

  listen lieutenant he said to me
very earnestly ill swear i didnt know
anything about any telegram and i had

no hand sendin anything honest t-

i was cornin down t mcmullen-gonna
fly down-and brace yuh down there right
on your home grounds where i could make
good on my complaint against yuh within
ten minutes with your c o i mean i
figured youd be easier t handle than cary
or upton-and i wouldnt be safe in this
town any way tryin to pull off the deal
burneyd frame me quick when you

come i pitched in-

  youre being pretty frank i told him
i couldnt get his drift quite he seemed
to be absolutely frank and straightforward
-and yet there was something curiously
sneaking about him-like a licked dog try-
ing to make friends or something of the
sort

  ill come clean he told me and now
wells wells wells

his eyes met mine firmly im entitled to
the dough evans im nothin-i know it
i never have been anything i come to this
town t try and make money and i aint
made a cent

  because your-plane and you your-
self generate about as much confidence as
id have in the word of judas iscariot

sloppy dirty-

  i know but ive fliwered a dozen
times tryin t make somethin down here
then my big chance come along i was
gonna get big money for makin that night
trip and a slice o the profits if they come
along then you spoiled it all and i got
nothin but a measly five hundred and had
to buy a prop out o that you fellowsve
got millions or will have-yuh put my life
in danger im down and out and-honest

t- evans yuh owe it to me

  this little speech sort of reached me-

sucker that i am for everything from a
hard-luck story to the tears of a gold-dig-
ging female if a woman cries i may know
shes just doing a sarah bernhardt but ill
give her the town hall any time as for a
hard-luck story-if i told you the amount
of money ive shelled out it would sound
as though i was talking in rubles

  malley youre talking through your
hat i told him you werent in for any
big money if the trip went through at all
maybe liberal payment yes and the
reason youre down on your luck is because

youre so-shiftless that youd leave a

ten-dollar bill on the sidewalk to save your-
self the trouble of picking it up thirdly
my dear brother youre mixed up in this
deal with graham whos already tried to
hold up old man burney

  at the same time that i was orating
thusly i was doing my best to think and
i had about come to the decision that a few
dollars might save a lot of trouble the
oilfields abound with the smartest shyster
lawyers who ever drew a crooked lease
a suit against the company on that little
matter of shooting off the prop of his air-
plane would be embarrassing and might
get the plaintiff a sizable chunk of money

  i tried to get myself to look at it as a
settlement out of court rather than black-
mail and id just about cranked up my
tongue to mention about two thousand
bucks in full settlement with a signed
statement that it was in full payment of all
damages when malley went wrong he

threw off his pose and his eyes were gleam-
ing with utter ferocity-so suddenly that it
was a shock

  youre a moral lecturer too are yuh

he snarled well listen here you -

big-mouthed hypocrite ill get you and ill
get you good you-

  the rest of his remarks would burn up
this paper and wreathe your head in heavy
blue smoke i stood for about three pretty
descriptive words and then i raised my
fist from somewhere alongside my knee and
dispatched it to the pointed chin of ex-
corporal malley it lifted him right off his
feet and deposited him like a sack of meal
against the building a couple of feet behind
him

  he didnt come back at me he was
dazed and he leaned against the wall and
said nothing while he was collecting his
wits

  thatll be that i told him if youd
kept your mouth shut you might have got
something now sue and be-to you

  his eyes were curiously ratlike as he
looked at me and when he spoke it was
with slow venom

  you think youre top o the deck now
but in just about an hour youll be squealin
like a stuck pig he told me as i was start-
ing to go

  you must think the law moves so fast
it would make radio seem like an ox-team
i told him maybe when youre tripping
over your tangled gray whiskers you may
have a decision on that suit

  he said nothing being scared of another
bat on the jaw i presume but he smiled a
nasty smile the boy actually appeared to
have an ace up his sleeve and to be gloating
over me which was cause for thought as
i ambled out of the alley and on the mobbed
sidewalk

it was only a quarter after two
so i took a turn down the street
and looked into a few joints just
for fun watched a couple of big
poker games turned down a pressing invi-
tation to tea from a strange woman talked
here and there with oil men id happened to
meet and in general passed a few minutes
surveying the feverish never-monotonous
life of an oil town in full boom

  when i happened to cock a snook at my
alarm clock i found that id used up my
fifteen minutes i cantered back the two
adventure

blocks to the imperial hotel and as i
thought of mr robert c craig i was con-
scious of a definite interest in the man
then my thoughts leaped lightly to malley
and the mysterious threat in his manner-
something not to be laid in my mind to
the coming lawsuit it must have been the
corporal who had sent that telegram to me
for some mysterious reason of his own i de-
cided apparently he expected something
to happen to me shortly

vi

         as i hove alongside the palatial
jlltx hostelfy  saw burneys glitter-
mmd ing high-powered car standing in

          the street a man at the wheel who
occasionally acted as chauffeur for burney
in the intervals of his duties as handy man
around the house as i entered the crowd-
ed office of the hotel-you couldnt call it
a lobby-i spotted none other than mr
robert c craig making his way through
the crowd toward the door accompanied
by an old acquaintance mr graham mr
graham was now shaved and decently
clothed

  it was twenty minutes of three that
was very peculiar craig on his way out and
graham undoubtedly with him there had
been no time to transact the deal they
couldnt have consummated it that quick

  i was in a bit of a whirl instinctively
i smelled something cheesy so to speak
looking ior something i couldnt accurately
describe i went up the stairs two at a time
bound for room 

  then without any more warning than an
electric light gives before it goes out it
seemed as though several pieces of a jigsaw
puzzle automatically fell into place in my
mind i connected vaguely that fake tele-
gram mr robert c craig mr malley and
his attitude a few moments before when i
socked him so hard he gave a little rein to
his feelings and mr graham

  if id had two seconds to think it out id
have heid the details set but i was so sure of
something that when i found room 
locked i backed up and hit it like an express
train would an eggcrate it crashed in-
and i saw old man burney and malcolm
cary bound and gagged on the floor bur-
ney was unconscious but malcolm rolled a
pair of demons eyes at me below a lump
the size of a lemon on his forehead

  in less time than a streak of light takes to
cross a room i had malcolm loose with the
aid of my trusty pen knife

  slugged you both and got the check
eh i asked him and he nodded as i
worked

 i hope to-they take the time to

cash the check i told him you give the
alarm and ill get out to the field they
must be planning to fly out of town-

  without saying another word i dashed
out of the room i knew malcolm would
give the alarm but suddenly i was sure of
one thing they were planning to use my
ship that had been the reason for the
fake telegram

  that superannuated jenny wouldnt get
to the mexican border without regassing
and it was too much of a wreck to trust on
a long trip any way malley was going to
steal my de haviland and fly craig and
graham over the border-and probably pick
up a few dollars for the ship from somebody
down there thats why theyd wired me
to come the whole oil deal had been a
fake cooked up by mr robert c craig
evidently a smart crook who had simply
used what tools came his way

  i went through the crowd in front of the
hotel like a tank through a pain of glass and
flung myself into the front seat of burneys
car the chauffeur knew me

  give me that wheel-your boss has been
robbed of fifty thousand bucks i told him
and within the next few seconds we were
crawling the half block to the nearest side-
street

  once i made the turn i gave that big
beauty the gun and we just skimmed across
the ruts and holes in the road it was the
longest way to the field but likewise the
fastest i told horan the chauffeur what
had happened as i sent that car along like a

bat out of- i didnt know just what i

was going to do except try to keep either
one of those ships from leaving the ground

  if the crooks had stopped to cash the
checks i might beat them out there but it
was supposed to have been certified and it
was my understanding that a certified check
cant be stopped under any circumstances
i was as sure as though id heard them talk-
ing that they were planning to fly my ship
out of hastings to the border

  and you can imagine how smart i felt
when i remembered that id nearly fallen
for that extra dough to malley
wells wells wells



  we made the three miles from the im-
perial hotel to the flying field in four sec-
onds less than nothing flat as i tooled the
big car into the pasture lot i saw that i
had beaten craig and graham-but my
ship was down at the lower end of the field
headed into the wind the motor idling and
beside it stood malley with two guns on
him one was in his hand and he shot at
us as i stopped the car he was three
hundred yards away but the shot was a
warning

  i stopped the car close to malleys de-
crepit jenny which was standing on the line
in front of the stained rickety canvas
hangar for a moment i was absolutely
stumped at any second craig and gra-
ham would arrive-and there was no way
i could put the de haviland out of com-
mission i had no gun

  i glanced back toward town and over the
flat fields i saw a car speeding toward us
it was a quarter of a mile away at that
same instant a wild plan sort of sparked
into being in my hot brain

  in about ten words id pointed out his
duty to horan and promised him half the
earth from burney if hed do it malley was
still standing beside the de haviland wait-
ing if the ships had only been reversed i
remember thinking the jenny wouldnt
do over ninety at the best and the d h
could step it off at a hundred and fifty

  i didnt know whether there was any gas
in the jenny or whether it was in flying
condition or not but i had to take a chance
horan and i jumped out of the car and
the chauffeur went to the propellor and
spun it wildly while i worked the primer in
the cockpit then i turned on the ignition
switch and ran around to the prop

malley was coming toward us
at a dead run shooting wildly
he was too far away to hit any-
thing of course as yet the
other car was coming like the wind and
behind it a mere speck was still another
that was malcolm in full pursuit i was sure

  i passed the prop on a gallop grabbing
it with one hand and giving it a mighty
jerk and the motor fairly warm because
of the blazing sun caught

  i had opened the throttle too far to make
sure the motor would continue to run if she
did start and the ship got in motion right
away

  get in the car and keep yourself out of
bullet range i yelled to horan and then
dragged myself into the cockpit of the
moving jenny and shoved the throttle on
all the way

  in all my flying career i have never gone
through more tense seconds than i did
while that jenny was speeding over the
ground a thousand things might be the
matter with it although as i looked over
the wings and flipped the controls just a
trifle it seemed to be working all right

  as i sped past malley he shot at me but
i was going too fast for him to hit me then
the jenny took the air

  it was so right-wing-heavy that it was a
truckdrivers job to keep the stick way over
to the left to hold the crate level and the
motor only turned up thirteen fifty and
would barely hold the ship in the air it
flew like a barn with wings on it

  five hundred yards back of the fence at
the lower edge of the field i was only fifty
feet high i nosed down until the boat was
level and banked around in almost a com-
plete circle when i was straightened out
i was headed across the field and the first
car was entering the limits of said pasture
malley was standing in the middle of the
field and horan was driving the burney car
out of the danger zone he had passed the
fugitive car evidently

  i knew id won so far as keeping those
thugs in town was concerned i nosed
down and as i got within a few yards
of the de haviland i was skimming the
ground the car with graham and craig
in it was scuttling down the field and
malley was running toward the d h

  i was headed right for the tail of the de
haviland and at right angles to the fuse-
lage having dived with the little ninety-
horse-power motor wide open that jenny
was going like a streak of light and the en-
gine was fairly shaking itself to pieces the
terrific air stream compounded of the speed
and the propellor wash nearly tore my head
from my shoulders as i flew with said knot on
the end of my backbone stuck over the side

  i was aiming for the big rudder at the very
end of the d h and i hit it there was
scarcely a jar as my left wing tip tore
through the frail linen and wood and the
next second i used my excess speed to zoom
up a trifle i looked back and down and
permitted myself a seraphic grin the rud-
der was a mass of wreckage-and that d h


adventure

wouldnt fly until a new one was procured

  the three crooks were standing beside the
ship now perhaps they were discussing
the weather they seemed to be excited

  i circled around for a landing as the sec-
ond car which was so full of men that spare
legs and arms stuck out here and there
snorted into the field and tore down on
the three buccaneers those gentlemen just
stuck their hands in the air as the half-
dozen men piled out several of them hold-
ing guns

  it wasnt such a bad deal-swapping a
hundred dollar rudder for fifty thousand
bucks i didnt think until after it was
over that i wasnt interested in a cent of the
fifty thousand-my little fifty acre share
would neither expand nor shrink

  all of which right from my near-fall for
malleys sob story down to risking my fool
neck to stop that aerial getaway goes to
show that the dumber they are the harder
they fall and that while no one can fool
a horse-fly anybody can fool a jackass-
flyer

vii

         thats about all of it we got

          the fifty thousand back graham
malley and craig-who proved
to be a very well-known highly
esteemed and successful crook-are making
pebbles out of boulders for the welfare of
the great commonwealth of texas and im
lounging around mcmullen

  the burney-howard development com-
pany sold out their holdings to one of the
standard group about a month after the
little soiree ive described for an even
million the last well burney brought
in flowed five thousand barrels my net
profit on that five thousand investment
cary made for me was close to sixty thou-
sand dollars

  ive done a fairly good job getting rid of
it give me time and itll be gone if i
have a cent more than a hundred dollars
to my name when it comes my turn to col-
lide with the earth at a high rate of speed
ill be sore as-
zthe camp-fire

c freetoall 

meeting place
for readers
writers and
dven hirers

   our camp-fire came into being may   with our june issue and since then
its fire has never died down many have gathered about it and they are of all classes
and degrees high and low rich and poor adventurers and stay-at-homes and from all
parts of the earth some whose voices we used to know have taken the long trail
and are heard no more but they are still memories among us and new voices are
heard and welcomed

   we are drawn together by a common liking for the strong clean things of out-of-
doors for word from the earths far places for man in action instead of caged by cir-
cumstance the spirit of adventure lives in all men the rest is chance

   but something besides a common interest holds us together somehow a real com-
radeship has grown up among us men can not thus meet and talk together without
growing into friendlier relations many a time does one of us come to the rest for facts
and guidance many a close personal friendship has our camp-fire built up between
fo men who had never met often has it proved an open sesame between strangers
in a far land

   perhaps our camp-fire is even a little more perhaps it is a bit of leaven working
gently among those of different station toward the fuller and more human understand-
ing and sympathy that will some day bring to man the real democracy and brotherhood
he seeks few indeed are the agencies that bring together on a friendly footing so many
and such great extremes as here and we are numbered by the hundred thousand now

if you are come to our camp-fire for the first time and find you like the things we
ike join us and find yourself very welcome there is no obligation except ordinary
manliness no forms or ceremonies no dues no officers no anything except men and
women gathered for interest and friendliness your desire to join makes you a member

        youll remember that there
was still some more to hear in our
discussion of julius caesar started
by talbot mundys having come
forward with an estimate of caesar very
much at variance with the usually accepted
one

u ere is a letter from arthur g brodeur
of the university of california whom
as a member of our writers brigade you
already know as one who is worth listen-
ing to on european history

berkeley california

  id make the general criticism of mr mundys
case that he takes a lot for granted for which there
is no evidence that he generalizes frightfully and
that he has selected as the basis of his argument
all the statements ever made by caesars enemies

and rejected all the testimony of his friends he
has even rejected some of the evidence ofiered by
caesars enemies when that evidence was favorable
to caesar and in several places where he alludes
to caesars commentaries it looks to me as if hes
misunderstoodjthe latin either he has or i have
that much is certain ill take up his points one
by one

      says caesar by his own showing was a
liar a brute a treacherous humbug and a
conceited ass as well as the ablest military expert
in the world at that time by his own showing
must mean that this is all revealed in the commen-
taries i cant see it the roman senate which
wanted his scalp at the time accused him of treach-
ery toward the germans but the fact seems to be
that casar merely took advantage of a fair oppor-
tunity to hit a self-confessed enemy ariovistus
who far outnumbered him at a strategic disadvan-
tage ariovistus expected a fight had come looking
for it ignored caesars warnings and then exposed
himself being a good general caesar thrashed




adventure

him as the french army of paris thrashed the ger-
mans when they lost their heads in the first battle
of the marne i cant find any place where csesar
reveals himself as a liar or a humbug conceited he
undoubtedly was-but an ass his enemies never
thought so nor was he any more of a brute than
any other leader of his time-not so much as most
ill give the proof of that later in response to this
general denunciation i will merely cite the signifi-
cant fact that cicero one of caesars staunchest
political opponents confessed that whenever he
shrank from caesars ambition he had to yield to
his great admiration for caesars character see
his letters nos  and following

af r mundy doesnt believe caesar wrote his
own commentaries-thinks his secretary did
and that a slave transcribed after caesar had edited
the copy whats his evidence for this merely
that he doesnt like caesar and that the first person
creeps in here and there into a narrative mostly in
the third person let me ask mr mundy whether
if he undertook to write up the account of eight or
nine years of his own busy life all in the third per-
son he wouldnt find it hard to avoid the first per-
sonal pronoun once in a while all that such lapses
mean is a slip of the pen its true that his legate
aulus hirtius wrote the th book of the commen-
taries but caesar never tried to hide the fact and
its most significant that cicero the prettiest stylist
and judge of prose style in roman times who had
heard caesar speak and seen his writings often re-
garded the commentaries as unquestionably written
by caesar himself and praises them as a model of
historical writing not only that but he judged
them accurate the men among caesars contempo-
raries who attacked his truthfulness were all his
enemies notably his bitter opponents dolabella
actorius naso and the elder curio and if there is
danger-as there is-in accepting a mans own
account of his deeds its just as dangerous and
absurd to reject his account altogether when that
account is about all there is to go by

vt r mundy accuses caesar of every form of
vice except drunkenness he seems to get
his evidence for these statements in his letter as
well as for the account of the songs sung by caesars
soldiers about his debauchery from suetonius it
is certainly not to be found in plutarch except for
the account of his liason with cleopatra which
seems to be established beyond question now
suetonius lived about a hundred and thirty years
after caesar he drew his materials partly from
actual court archives and partly from sheer gossip
of the latter there was plenty about caesar as there
is about any great man who has bitter enemies
moreover suetonius manages to accuse every one of
whom he writes of loose living and finally how
much reliance is to be placed in his estimate of
caesars virtue may be gleaned from the following
fact in sections  and following he accuses caesar
of every kind of wantonness but in section  he
says in so many words there was no stain on
his reputation for chastity except his intimacy with
king nicomedes and that one exception rotten
enough if true may be dismissed as sheer drivel for
the one thing certainly known about caesars char-
acter was that he possessed too high an opinion of
himself for that particular form of baseness but
notice how-with that exception-suetonius mr

mundys source denies his own statements per-
sonally i dont believe that caesar was much better
or much worse in sexual morality than his fellow
nobles but we must remember that the puritan tra-
dition did not exist until the th century its silly
to judge the morals of a single man of classic times
by our professed standards of today from our
standpoint ancient rome was rotten morally but
it was no worse than greece assyria or any other
ancient civilization except the one relatively pure
civilization of the hebrews we vaunt ourselves on
our own morality-but look up our own venereal
statistics and then judge if were any better than
the romans

 j-je habitually used the plunder of con-
quered cities for the purpose of bribing the
roman senate i object to the word habitually
its true that he took the plunder of conquered cities
for himself but its also true that he distributed it
not to the senators whom he knew he couldnt win
over but to his soldiers and to the people of rome-
partly in wheat partly in the form of lavish amuse-
ments partly in the reconstruction of those same
cities he had destroyed filling them with roman
citizens he cut ofi the hands of fifty thousand
gauls on one occasion as a mere act of retaliation
well he cut them off all right but not as an act of
retaliation he knew that if he spared those fight-
ing men who had so recently imperiled romes
power he would soon have them in arms against
him once more cruel absolutely but not one
of caesars worst enemies ever accused him of
cruelty for crueltys sake more of that anon let
me cite over against his cruelty the following evi-
dence of his mercy which was exceptional not only
for a roman but for any man of ancient times
after he had ended his civil wars he did so honor-
ably behave himself that there was no fault to be
found in him and therefore methinks amongst
other honors they gave him he rightfully deserved
this that they should build him a temple of clem-
ency to thank him for his courtesy he had used unto
them in his victory for he pardoned many of them
that had borne arms against him and furthermore
did prefer some of them to honor and office in the
commonwealth as amongst others cassius and
brutus both the which were made praetors
plutarch norths translation n b-plutarch
lived long after caesars death and had no axe to
grind and he didnt get his material from caesars
own writings either

  as for his breaking his word often and treacher-
ously i cant find any support for the statement
where is the evidence cicero his adversary
praises his honorable character sure he was vain-
vain as a peacock so have other men been for less
reason he did have himself deified with all the
rest of it no excuse for that ill admit

 j-je pretends his expeditions to britain were
successful but does he i read in his
commentaries just about the same implicit con-
fession of lack of real success that mr mundy gives
explicitly caesar simply states the case objectively
he doesnt call himself a damn fool to be sure but
he claims no more than that his second and more
successful expedition resulted in the winning of
some hostages and plunder the raiding to london
and the levy of tribute the tribute by the way
could not be enforced
the camp-fire



  nothing could be more misleading than mr
mundys statement and whatever caesar wrote
about those expeditions what his men had to say
about them can be surmised fairly accurately from
the fact that rome left britain severely alone for
several generations scarcely less misleading is
the expression a successful general does not usu-
ally sneak away by night and the assertion that
he cleared out of britain again as fast as possible
true he did clear out as fast as possible but not for
the reason mr mundy assumes he had received
word that gaul was on fire with incipient rebellion
behind him and he was good enough general to
abandon a new conquest persistence in which would
have cut him off from his sole base of supplies and
source of reenforcements for that matter caesar
never had any intention of conquering britain on
those expeditions he knew he didnt have men
enough

  he had two purposes one to find out what
britain and its people were like and secondly-the
the more vital reason-to convince the britons that
theyd better stop sending aid to the rebellious
tribes in gaul in this purpose he succeeded if
he didnt make a single permanent conquest in the
island at least the britons kept out of gaul for
four hundred years afterward except as they came
during the third and fourth centuries a d as
roman subjects

  the real reason why neither csesar nor his suc-
cessors augustus and tiberius attempted to invade
britain again was that they had their hands too
full elsewhere caesar was no sooner back than his
laughters death drew him to italy and the uprising
in gaul brought him back there again to hold down
his earlier conquests from gaul he had to inarch
into italy to save his position and his very neck
from the envious nobles and the senate and then he
was up to his neck in civil war from then on he
had his hands full pacifying the roman world and
keeping it pacified he died before he could get
his hands free for fresh conquests his succes-
sors had all they could do to keep the germans
from invading gaul and rome mark well just
as soon as rome got a real breathing spell under
claudius britain was invaded again-and rome
thenceforth kept on till she conquered britain and
made it a province if csesar had had the time and
the man-power that claudius had he would have
done the job himself but he considered his life as
worth more than another province and his rule more
important than conquest if he had been able to
undertake it his men would have followed eagerly
both plutarch and suetonous pay tribute to his mar-
velous ascendency over the hearts of his men

esar did call the britons barbarians but he
did not call them savages moreover the word
barbarus winch we translate barbarian did not
mean the same thing to the roman that it means to
us the roman like the greek called all peoples
barbari who didnt belong to the mediterranean
world the word has its origin not in any under-
valuation of foreign cultures but in the uncouth
effect produced on the greco-roman ear by the
sound of a foreign speech csesar clearly and faith-
fully describes the britons as possessing two dis-
tinct cultures one of which closely related to that
of gaul he describes as characterized by settled
cities coinage the use of iron and agriculture
this doesnt look as if he reported them barbarians

in our sense of the word i dont agree with mr
mundy that they were the waning tag-end of a
high civilization the archeological evidence shows
clearly that they were rather a semi-civilized peo-
ple well on the up-grade and rising fast they had
fine skill in the use of metals in all forms of art
not concerned with the human figure and-pretty
certainly-in poetry but their poetry was not
written down they had no consecutive alphabet
till they learned the roman alphabet from their
conquerors they were mixed true but they
were in general of two types which are not clearly
accounted for by the roman writers it is certain
only that at least two celtic stocks went to make
them and that they had absorbed a large part of
the earlier stone-age inhabitants of the island

jyj r mundy is all off on the samothracian
mysteries largely because he conjectures so
much without evidence he hits the nail on the
head only when he says that they have baffled
most historians i should say all historians except
the ruddy guessers and that nothing whatever is
known of their actual teaching they were highly
respected-especially by the romans it is not at
all certain-in fact it is highly unlikely-that all
the mysteries were based on the theory of uni-
versal brotherhood we have no record of a single
mystery that so concerned itself all the myster-
ies were concerned directly with the cult of a defi-
nite god or goddess or combinations of gods and
goddesses and what little we know about them in-
dicates that they may have celebrated various forms
of a widely distributed fertility cult the mys-
teries of samothrace are known and this is about all
we do know about them to have had much to do
with the worship of the cabiri and consequently
there is good ground to suppose as the greeks and
romans did suppose that these mysteries were more
or less lascivious but it was a natural and relative-
ly naive lasciviousness such as has been associated
with fertility cults all over the world see frazer
golden bough magic

  i cant see what mr mundy is getting at by
dragging in freemasonry there isnt the slightest
relation between it or its ritual or beliefs with those
of any ancient classical mystery his statement
that no initiate of any genuine mystery would go
so far as to consider human sacrifice or any form of
preventable cruelty is little short of marvelous
has he never heard of the mysteries of cybele
with their ghastly licentiousness and mutilation
and these were genuine mysteries druidism does
not class with the mysteries and has no connection
with those of samothrace

the statement that caesar loathed the druids
hasnt a shred of evidence to back it he gives a
clear and not altogether unsympathetic account of
the druids to be sure he says that they practised
human sacrifice and the absolute truth of his state-
ment is borne out by the independent testimony of
diodorus and the high authority of tacitus the
thing is proved-to deny druidical human sacrifice
is to deny every contemporary authority that we
have for that matter human sacrifice has been
practised pretty much all over europe at one time
or another

  mr mundy says that csesar admits in his com-
mentaries that he burned the druids alive i
cant find any such admission in the commentaries


adventure

and ive been through them with a fine-tooth comb
checking up by searching all the best csesar-lexi-
cons maybe i have overlooked something but i
dont think so if i have ill be glad to be cor-
rected nor did caesars enemies in rome who
raised every possible accusation against him even
mention any such thing as this

now for mr mundys scatter-gun assault on
the romans generally it comes down to a
general assertion that they were responsible for
most of the cruelty and militarism that has vexed
the world since their times that they were brutal
inartistic and inefficient in everything but discipline
he admits their success as engineers and law-
makers but blames our modern social ills on the
part played by the roman law in our own legal
development well-

  the greeks were notoriously as licentious in their
best days as the romans were in their worst sys-
tematic immorality was practised as a part of
assyrio-babylonian and phcenician religion the
temples of aphrodite at corinth and paphos were
public brothels see what burton has to say as to
moslem immorality the fact is that the romans
were no worse than any other ancient people the
hebrews always excepted and for a large part of
their career they were better than most their de-
cline began with their conquest of greece when
they came into contact with the degenerate prac-
tises of that country but the greeks used those
practises even in the time of pericles and before
why pick on the romans particularly 

n cruelty ever reported of the romans
ever surpassed the treatment of the athenians
by the victorious syracusans the persians regu-
larly surpassed them in savage brutality the
assyrians were a byword for cruelty indeed no
ancient people ever treated an enemy with gentle-
ness so far as i know the hebrews were as bad as
the worst in this respect-read judges and chron-
icles their very entrance into the promised land
is one bloody record of the utter extermination of
the previous inhabitants cruelty militarism
you cant beat the hebrews for that nor could
the romans ever surpass the militarism of sparta
of athens of persia-except that they had better
success thanks to that discipline which mr mundy
concedes them rome was no more a destroyer
than any other pre-christian empire-or some
christian ones in art it is true they imitated
first the etruscans and then the greeks but they
imitated both darned well-as the early japanese
artists imitated the chinese

vhy pick on the classics does mr mundy
mean to say that we owe nine-tenths of the
false philosophy and the mercenary imperialism
that has brought the world to its present state of
perplexity and distress to the study in our schools
of such writers as virgil horace the great natural-
ist pliny the gentle humane pliny secundus
seneca cicero noble philosophers if the world has
ever had any lucretius who anticipated darwin
in his philosophy of evolution and the historians
sallust livy and tacitus does he ignore the
fact that many of the christian fathers derived
much of their inspiration from the roman classics

  yes certain roman provincial governors sys-
tematically looted their trusts of everything fine and

precious they could lay their hands on but balance
against the avaricious verres the gentle cicero who
prosecuted him balance the well-loved governor
sertorius against the plundering of syria balance
caesars own reformation of the provincial govern-
ments against the charges laid against him and
the fact emerges that during the greater part of
romes empire her provinces and colonies were so
well governed that they would have counted it a
calamity to be free from rome britain herself
when rome abandoned her wailed piteously for her
yoke to be restored and the britons came to regard
rome as the well-beloved mother to whose defense
against the barbarians they voluntarily contributed
a legion of their own best and bravest though the
saxon was beating at the door

  the extinction of rome by the germanic bar-
barians plunged the european world into darkness
for centuries the remains of roman law alone
made possible the erection of stable kingdoms and
at the end of the middle ages the rediscovery of the
best of roman and greek literature flooded europe
with a new tide of humane learning

a nother word about csesar it apparently
didnt occur to mr mundy to ask why he
conquered gaul and invaded germany and britain
when he went to cisalpine gaul already roman-
made so in a series of campaigns to save rome itself
from gallic invasion he found the helvetii about
to pour in from the alps and menace rome with
a new tide of conquest to save italy he had to
trounce the helvetii and from then on he was
forced to extend roman sway over all transalpine
gaul lest the gauls themselves invade italy forced
from their own homes by a threatening flood of
german immigration he invaded germany to
teach the germans that it wasnt safe to try to dis-
member the roman empire had he not tackled
them when he did rome would have been german
within a hundred years he succeeded so well that
he prolonged romes life for at least three centu-
ries he made his attempt on britain because the
southern britons were perpetually giving aid and
comfort to the rebellious gauls all in all he and
he alone saved italy from being swamped by a
semi-barbaric flood of merciless enemies

 cant quit without assailing mr mundys
most vulnerable point he says there is plenty
of information from ancient british welsh and
irish sources to refute much of what caesar writes
giving mr mundy full credit for the sincerity which
always characterizes his writings i rise to say that
this statement shows him to be absolutely misin-
formed there does not exist one shred of british
welsh or irish writing of any age or genuineness
which touches on caesar in the remotest degree no
old irish or british document so much as mentions
his life or conquests the earliest document touch-
ing romans in relation to britain and written by a
briton is the work of gildas th century a d
and gildas not only calls himself a roman citizen
but lustily bawls out all britons who have forgotten
their faith to rome and this a century after the
romans had given the briton up-after the fall of
rome itself

   the welsh are the descendants of those britons
who sought refuge in wales from the saxons they
have no writings which criticise or refute caesar no
irish welsh or british writing nor even tradition
the camp-fire



so much as verges on a criticism or denial of any-
thing he ever wrote i wonder if mr mundy has by
any chance been misled by the th century history
of the britons by geoffrey of monmouth geoffrey
does handle caesar very severely but it must be
remembered that geoffrey was a faker of the first
water so esteemed by his own contemporaries as
well as by modern scholars giraldus cambrensis
has exposed him prettily geoffrey didnt know
any history except what he got from roman writers
anyway and he faked that in his desire to make
out the britons as older than the romans he
foisted on the world that bum old legend of the
establishment of the kingdom of britain by brut
who was supposed to be a descendant of eneas in
more direct line that the romans its all poppy-
cock

hpo sum up in almost all essentials i hold mr

    mundy blinded by prejudice and it seems
plain that he has got his material in a very one-
sided way ignoring all the evidence in caesars
favor and accepting as gospel all the billingsgate
of cassars enemies in his reaction to the blind
following of caesars own statements he has run
full-tilt into the opposite extreme-arthur g
brodeur

professor brodeurs letter did
not reach us in time to be sent to mr
mundy along with the other letters called
forth by his original expression of opinion
so mr mundys following letter is a re-
ply to all the others but of course not a
reply to professor brodeurs there is no
attempt to cite book and verse in detail
but youll remember that in his answer to
arthur d howden smith mr mundy
cited them in abundance giving evidence
that his opinions had been formed only
after wide research and a weighing of much
evidence

  later if he cares to do so he should be
given opportunity to answer professor
brodeur in rebuttal

  as to whether mr mundys estimate of
caesai has been proved unsound i am not
prepared to say i neither endorsed nor
combatted it in the beginning and all that
ive since learned about csesar only con-
vinces me the more that its rash to venture
any final opinion on such a matter without
far more research than im in a position to
give but again as in the beginning i
thank mr mundy for having jolted me out
of my unthinking rut he made me stop
accepting without thought or question the
usual conception of a character in history
perhaps that usual conception is correct
perhaps not julius caesar himself is no
important issue in my life but im glad that
mr mundys iconoclastic views have made

me change from a sheep-like acceptance of
other peoples views to an open mind some
of you as these letters have shown were in
no need of being jolted into thinking for
themselves but others were and i hope
that like me they got the jolt and are glad
they did

 open-mindedness and tolerance-these
are of more value than the mere facts about

caesar

point loma california

  there are some redoubtable antagonists to answer
some of whom have chosen to spread this discussion
of julius caesar and rome over such a wide field
that it is utterly impossible to compress a detailed
answer within the pages of one magazine on my
shelves there are at least two hundred thousand
pages of roman history some of them in remark-
ably small type professor gibbon required a
number of volumes in which to unfold his theory of
romes decline and fall and it is not likely that the
editor would let me write any such essay for camp-
fire i am obliged to have to say then to begin
with that my statements are based on intensive
study of classical as well as modern authors and
that i have devoted all my spare time for several
weeks in going over notes in order to be able to
define my argument clearly but there wont be
much room to give chapter and verse

the first point i would like to make is this that
although because far more than fifty per cent
of the worlds inhabitants are decent fellows some
of us are able to enjoy a qualified contentment
nevertheless there are not many who pretend that
the world is in a reasonably decent state it surely
might be better managed and there must be a
reason why it is not better managed i attribute
the blame very largely to the greatly exaggerated
estimate of the value of romes civilization that has
been drilled into generation after generation for
centuries

  there are two things that i hate with all my
heart the first is standardized opinion cut and
dried and handed out to us by those who do not be-
lieve in encouraging independent thought the
second which is like unto it is that attitude of
mind which summons the mob to come and help
murder any one who dares to form opinions of his
own there are all sorts of gradations of both those
mental habits nearly all of which are quite uncon-
sciously acquired and practised and the most
worth while thing but the most difficult thing in the
world is to break away from them

ne or two other axioms the world is much
older than rome and in the history of the
world viewed largely the roman empire is only an
episode to quote george bernard shaw he who
only knows the official side of a controversy knows
less than nothing about it we must not pretend
to ourselves that human nature has changed very
much in a couple of thousand years or that those
who wrote the histories of rome for wealthy patrons
were reliable-were any more reliable that is than
the biographers of modem personages or than the
gentlemen who wrote our war-time news we have
a full right to select the evidence accepting this


adventure

rejecting that and to use our own recent history as a
guide to what is likely and what is utterly im-
probable

  like most people i was raised under the roman
influence that is to say i received what was
humorously described as a classical education and
the text-books from which i was taught and the
teachers who distributed reward and punishment
agreed to inculcate the doctrine that romes empire
was a good thing for the world and admirable as a
whole if damnable in detail we schoolboys had no
more will or inclination to break loose from that in-
struction than a sheep has will to break loose from
its fold or a horse from its stable

  it should be borne in mind that for centuries the
education of the western world was mainly when
not entirely in the hands of the inheritors of roman
tradition that governments have regarded rome as
the fountain of law which she was not rome
learned her law from greece in bc  and hare
consequently regarded rome as the first parent of
their own exceeding wisdom yet without so often
demonstrating wisdom as to excite our veneration
and that for many centuries rome has claimed to be
the fountain-head of christianity a fact which has
had an enormous influence on our mental attitude
toward anything that has any bearing on rome it-
self i am not going to touch on the religious ques-
tion beyond thus briefly drawing attention to that
one phase of it

  the purpose of the roman empire was to make
life comfortable for the romans and to keep other
people out of mischief it is the tendency of all
governments to destroy liberty in order to make
their own task easier and if the end should justify
the means then all we need to consider is romes
end and for that we may look around us here to-
day is the net result of roman theories-war mis-
trust rancor suspicion hatred misgovemment
and a world not half so civilized as china was two
thousand years ago

  i do not believe that even the most glorious end
can justify abominable means and romes end was
and is inglorious nor do i believe that bad means
can accomplish a good end in any instance and it
was looking for causes of present conditions that led
me to study romes history to compare it as far as
possible with the history of other nations and to try
to estimate romes influence as an element in
modem problems

  rome from the beginning was a robber in a state
of almost constant war with all her neighbors her
early civilization was certainly not higher than that
of the teuts was later on at the time when they
overran rome up to and including the time of
julius caesar there is nothing bad enough that can
be said of rome of her civilization her morals her
social conditions her dealings with other nations
her lawlessness greed and hypocrisy the point
can not be argued it is enough to read the histories
written by romans themselves who desired to paint
a favorable picture of their city

we are asked to believe that julius caesar
suddenly was bom out of the blue he per-
sonally claimed descent from the goddess venus
and that by winning the votes of the vilest mob that
the world of that day knew and setting forth to con-
quer and plunder all the hitherto unconquered na-
tions within reach he changed that mob into world-
saviors rome which could not manage her own

affairs and which permitted caesar to be murdered
by as cowardly and corrupt a gang of politicians as
ever disgraced a nationss record suddenly became
wise enough and fit to manage the affairs of the
whole of europe

  the fact i believe is that she established prin-
ciples of misrule from which the united states and
all other countries in the world are suffering today

  julius csesar was undoubtedly the greatest soldier
of his day he found the surrounding peoples weak
and took advantage of his opportunity the gauls
for instance whose civilization must have been
enormously superior to romes were at the end of a
cycle of activity at war among themselves and
possessed of no capable general who could command
a united army they derived their civilization
from ancient egypt see for instance wales her
origins struggles and later history institu-
tions and manners by gilbert stone harper
caesar doubtless with the same motives that in-
duced our mr creel to slander the germans and
induced the germans to describe ourselves as sav-
ages recorded every instance he could find of gaul-
ish turpitude and denied them credit for any super-
ior civilization nevertheless we are again asked
to believe by those who believe caesar that these
same uncivilized gauls absorbed the glorious roman
civilization and surpassed it in a generation we
find in the reign of augustus that the gauls were
already living better in every way than the romans
and that romans were being taught by them

  a peoples ability to forge ahead in response to
energy injected from abroad is in proportion to the
recentness and height of its own past civilization
when civilization touches an inferior race it usually
kills it out rome went to school to virgil whose
name is gaulish and to seneca quintilian and
many others from the conquered barbarian prov-
inces can you imagine roosevelt going to school
to a redskin or cecil rhodes to a hottentot

  actually rome herself never became civilized in
the sense that she originated any of the arts she im-
ported all her culture from the conquered provinces
thoroughly despised it patronized it as the nouveaux
riches invariably do and in the end was swamped
because she could not understand it

 favorite argument used by most of my op-
ponents is that the world was rotten at that
time and that rome made the best of the situation
that yes rome was a robber and exploiter but so
was everybody else that romes method was un-
doubtedly outrageous but that she gave the world
good government

  did she or did the world achieve good govern-
ment in spite of rome and was that government
so good remember art music medicine science
philosophy everything worth while had vanished
from the earth after three or four hundred years of
romes predominance inculcated adult docility
can not rightly be called good government unless
your standard of perfection is the stable

  i do not believe for one minute after reading
everything i can find in julius caesars favor that
he visualized the roman empire he was a soldier
and he proved himself able to defeat all comers in-
tellectually as well as on the field of battle he was a
man of titanic energy who went mad believing
himself to be a god and who died in the midst of
preparations to invade india by way of persia with
a view to surpassing the exploits of alexander
the camp-fire



qctavian augustus was a man of a to tally-
different character caesar had left the
known world practically conquered and augustus
spent a long life busily perfecting the machine that
should control the world he appears to have
labored honestly and with prodigious genius and if
not he then later emperors undoubtedly did imag-
ine and produce an empire in which every man re-
garded himself as a roman

  but what did they mean by roman with the
exception of augustus the emperors who produced
the condition we are asked to praise were them-
selves not romans neither were the ablest men
whom they employed rome itself was an un-
healthy city which even julius cassar contemplated
abandoning for alexandria and the empire was called
roman for centuries after romes decay when
roman blood had died out or had become so mixed
as to be hardly traceable they meant they had
accepted romes theory of government her method
and her ideals what did those amount to

j-jere is an extract from tacitus life of agri-
cola quoting the speech of the british chieftan
calgacus on the eve of a battle after eight years
resistance to roman arms remember tacitus
was a roman

  these plunderers of the world after exhausting
the land by their devastations-stimulated by avar-
ice if their enemy be rich by ambition if poor un-
satiated by the east and by the west the only
people who behold wealth and indigence with equal
avidity to ravage to slaughter to usurp under
false titles they call empire and where they make
a desert they call it peace our children and rela-
tions-are torn away from us by levies to serve in
foreign lands our wives and sisters-are polluted
under names of friendship and hospitality our
estates and possessions are consumed in tributes
our grain in contributions even our bodies are
worn down amidst stripes and insults in clearing
woods and draining marshes acquiring renown
from our discords and dissensions they convert the
faults of their enemies to the glory of their own
army an army compounded of the most different
nations which success alone has kept together
the omissions are made to save space in full the
text is even stronger

  and here is the gist of agricolas address to the
roman troops on the eve of the same battle

  it is now the eighth year my fellow soldiers in
which under the high auspices of the roman empire
by your valor and perseverence you have been con-
quering britain we have proceeded beyond the
limits of former commanders and former armies
we have arms in our hands and in these we have
everything the bravest of the britons have long
since fallen the remaining number consists solely of
the cowardly and the spiritless close a struggle of
fifty years with one great day and convince your
countrymen that to the army ought not to be im-
puted either the protraction of the war or the causes
of the rebellion

  we know what we all had to say about abdul
hamid when he proposed to settle the armenian
question by abolishing the armenians i myself
can remember some stinging remarks addressed to
me personally in reference to the conduct of the
british army in south africa but it seems it was a
roman who invented the delightful theory that men
who resist invasion by all means in their power for

  

fifty years are cowards and spiritless neverthe-
less agricola was one of the romans whose memory
i was taught at school to cherish and there are
actually hundreds of learned professors who have
written books to prove among other things that
agricolas campaign was a blessing to britain

and that brings us to another angle of the argu-
ment several correspondents have made the
point that the gauls after tasting rebellion in ad
 decided to adhere to rome but it must be
borne in mind that caesar had trounced gaul
thoroughly a hundred years before and that after
him augustus had imposed the roman system and
reorganized society in the result the gauls had be-
come incapable of self-rule the same applies to the
britons and to any other people rome had con-
quered-just as it applies today to india cuba the
philippines egypt algeria or any other country
that has been absorbed and exploited on the roman
pattern the alternative to roman rule was a
period of protracted anarchy and just as in india
today the native princes and all those who derive
income and authority from the british system are
pro-british and most of the wealthier merchants
dread the thought of the anarchy that would in-
evitably follow the overthrow of british rule so it
was in gaul and in all the other conquered roman
provinces it was the curse of the roman system
that while it strove to unite the world under one
rule and more or less accomplished that it reduced
it to one dead-level of mediocrity and deprived its
members of ability to rule themselves

  pleasure in living progress civilization consist
in differences-not similarities-of opinion habit
manners aims but our schools are patterned on
romes method our politics are fashioned on romes
principle might either in the shape of a victorious
army or an organized mob yelling catch words is
right and vae victis

  the average number of men of noble character is
probably fairly constant all down the ages rome
seems to have had at least her average proportion
and was favored i think with more than the aver-
age number of rulers of great ability augustus
tiberius the antonines for instance were men of
great talent breadth of view and constancy of pur-
pose they were able to draw from the whole
known world for their lieutenants and if their prin-
ciple had been sound it is likely that romes heyday
would have lasted longer

ntothing seems more obvious to one who
reads comparative history than that energy
moves in cycles raising first one people then an-
other romes rise was probably inevitable and it
well may be that the condition of all other nations at
that time was from a standpoint of energy inferior
to romes but rome had been psychologized by
julius caesar who was deified as a sort of conquering
god and though she had the strength to subdue
europe just as for instance england had the
strength to subdue india and spain the philippines
she had not the imagination necessary to encourage
or enforce that liberty of thought and independence
of view that are necessary to the progress of the
world

  the course of england in india is an extremely in-
teresting parallel there are others nearer home
but it is always easier to see faults farther off it
may be that india was ripe for conquest and that if
i

adventure

the british had not defeated the french india would
have become a french possession-just as the
gauls might have fallen to the teuts if rome had
not stepped in but the point is that england has
exactly copied romes mistake by making india ap-
parently incapable of self-government forever de-
pendent on foreign troops to keep the peace within
her own borders and on foreign officials to prevent
corruption by trying to make the indians think
they are members of the british empire and by im-
posing on india systems of education and trade that
are totally foreign to her genius she has provided
roads and peace within indias borders she has
administered india much more honestly than rome
ever administered a conquered country and she has
not permitted slavery in the form of legal ownership
of the person but because britons were all edu-
cated in the roman tradition she has never had the
wit to see that liberty and independance are the
things which should be forced on to a backward
nation--not obedience and dependence

vf ost of us like slavery and dependence in one
form or another although it is frightfully bad
for us and today as a result of the roman tra-
dition we are all trying to legislate ourselves into
kingdom come and to devolve responsibility upon
some form of central government whose duty shall
be to take the blame for everything and absolve us
individuals from the necessity of thinking or of
doing anything except amuse ourselves and say
yes maam to the rigid opinion of the day

  it is not nearly so important to discover that
caesar was personally vicious as well as brilliant or
that rome was unscrupulous as well as energetic as
to realize that romes first principles were rotten-
with the result that her ablest men though they
strove like titans to resist the tide could do nothing
for the worlds eventual progress europe was
swamped under romes decay because rome had
taught false principles and had enforced them

afr james hathaway remarks that the
roman legion was no more hard boiled than
any other body of men would have been under simi-
lar conditions that is probably true but when
he goes on to say that the women of the plundered
country dont object he reminds me of the cornish
fisherman who used to take me sailing when i was a
boy i found him one day skinning a live conger-
eel and i suggested that anyhow he might kill the
eel first he shifted his pipe to the other corner of
his mouth looked tolerantly scornful said lot
bless ye boy he likes it -and went on skinning
but just as his was a decent old fishermans point
of view so is mr hathaways an experienced sold-
iers and i can differ from mr hathaway without
imputing anything but kindly motives to him i
dont doubt he and i could swap some interesting
yams

  another man writes that he will skip my stories
in future because i have taken an opposite view to
his regarding rome and caesar i forgive him on
condition that he will read up roman history and
form his own opinions at first hand i would much
rather set you all thinking than have you all agree
with me i surely do enjoy a man who has a stout
opinion based on real investigation of the facts

  hugh pendexter writes wondering whether
caesar really was such a great general after all i
know hugh and the state of maine a lot too well

to argue with him when hugh makes that sort
of suggestion it means he has facts up his sleeve and
is trying to inveigle me into taking the other side
so hugh wins until i get time to study strategy-
and even so im afraid he would study it more
quickly and blind me with science no hugh
nothing doing i wont be drawn

  mr h g patterson seems to me to hit one nail
on the head when he suggests that however right i
may or may not be about caesar and rome-if we
go to our children with all our doubts various views
and contradictions they would not get started on
any history i lean toward shaws view of it
however shaw suggests with his usual clarified
vehemence that the soundest teaching by the ablest
schoolmaster is -worth nothing unless the ablest
available opponent of that teaching shall receive an
equal hearing thus encouraging the youngster to
form independent judgment after hearing both
sides when i went to school i was cruelly pun-
ished if i dared to form a judgment of my own

  and there is an alternative to teaching roman
history how about comparative history why
not study the chinese indians and phenicians all of
whom had a civilization vastly higher than romes
giles gems of chinese literature is a much bet-
ter book than anything the romans have be-
queathed to us

  the roman empire was conducted on principles
diametrically opposite tothose taught by all of the
worlds really great philosophers so if roman
history must be taught in schools why not teach it
in such manner as to point out that the secret of all
progress is in thinking by the individual and results
from individual effort or whether in painting music
sculpture writing medicine surgery science in
fact in anything except slavery rome special-
ized in slavery she made it as picturesque
efficient and commercially profitable as it could be
made and rome fell so will we if we continue
in her footsteps-talbot mundy

well mr mundy certainly doesnt
dodge trouble he has the temerity
to end up by comparing the civilizations of
china india and phenicia with that of
rome the nerve of it whoever heard of
such a thing and he even dares to say
that the civilizations of such countries as
those were superior to romes

  that is likely to be the general reaction to
such a comparison but let us of camp-fire
be a little less hasty and a little more toler-
ant suppose that before we either dis-
agree or agree with mr mundy we first
of all ask ourselves whether we really know
sufficient about all these civilizations to
support a final opinion of our own and
second that we ask ourselves to just what
extent we can prove that our sources of in-
formation are reliable and sufficiently nu-
merous and third how thoroughly have
we weighed analyzed compared challenged
and reasoned about our information and its
sources
the camp-fire



  personally though i know a little about
each of those civilizations i realize id be a
fool to attempt proving any one of them bet-
ter than the other the best i can do is to
know i dont know to be wide open to more
testimony and to refuse steadfastly to ac-
cept anybodys verdict until i can hear all
available testimony and try to reason out a
conclusion of my own but some of you
are far better equipped to pass judgment
than i ive an idea there are not many
people in the world who know those four
civilizations with sufficient thoroughness to
compare them with any real intelligence
but there are quite a number among us who
are pretty well versed on one or more of
these three other civilizations mr mundy
mentions harold lamb for example can
tell us quite a little about china that most
of us dont know wont some of you who
know start the ball rolling with surveys of
one or more of these civilizations lets
not call it an argument but an examination
-the object being to find out the truth not
the rather empty accomplishment of prov-
ing any given theory sound or unsound-

a brief word from albert wil-
--v mr liam stone in connection with his
story in this issue camp-fire
always likes to know just how
much actual historical fact lies back of our
stories

denver colorado

  it is a story of the old southwest about sixty
years ago when the old western cattle trail was
infested with hostile indians and life was pictur-
esquely uncertain for the cowmen i think you will
find it pretty accurate where accuracy is essential
as i spent a lot of time looking up facts joe loving
and another pioneer cowman actually stood off a
band of comanches in a buffalo wallow somewhere
around -albert w stone

there goes the finger-print
system at least there go the
present methods of using it and
the far-reaching dependence
hitherto attached to it a letter from e e
harriman of a a and our writers bri-
gade i carefully omit from his letter to
me the detailed description of his method
of transferring finger-prints its certainly
ingenious but not the kind of information to
broadcast

  for a long time fingerprints have been held abso-
lute proof of identity if a man were arrested for a

crime and his fingerprints were found upon any-
thing at the scene of the crime he was cooked

por twenty years my friend milton carlson
handwriting expert has claimed that this was
unjust consistently he has insisted that there
must at least be proof of opportunity the ac-
cused must have been in the vicinity beyond ques-
tion police detectives scoffed

  the chief of detectives in los angeles was james
hosick james held with sir e r henry of scot-
land yard as to the finality of fingerprint evidence
milton carlson went to see hosick

  they argued then milton said goodby and
offered his hand with a laugh saying they would
not quarrel over it hosick shook hands

  a week later came milton carlson solemn as an
owl frowning and serious he took hosick to task
for entering his office and ransacking his files he
said those files were private valuable and not to be
meddled with hosick got mad swore claimed he
had never seen the files in question carlson
wagged an unbelieving head

  then how the -- did your fingerprints get on
this revolver which is kept in those files and has
never been out of the office since i bought it two
years ago until now

  jim hosick studied the gun four detectives ex-
amined it they got the fingerprint card of hosick
from the files the bothered and puzzled chief swore
he never saw the gun or touched it before but ac-
knowledged the prints were his own

  you are right hosick said carlson i took
your prints when i shook hands with you the last
time i was here i transferred them to the gun
thumb on left side index finger on right do i
win

a gain carlson went to valdez alaska to help
defend a young man charged with burglary
bloody prints on a -broken light of glass had been
asserted to be his in open court all the government-
called experts swore there could be no mistake as
they had found eleven homologous characteristics in
the blood prints corresponding to the finger of
virgil rich then milton carlson went on the
stand

  before he got through with the case he had
proved that one fingerprint shown in the book by
sir e r henry acknowledged father of the present
system of fingerprint evidence gathering held four-
teen homologous characteristics corresponding to
those offered in evidence since the print in the
book was taken from a prisoner more than forty
years old at the time and the time was ten years
prior to the act for which virgil rich aged twenty-
four was on trial the claims of the experts were
upset and virgil rich acquitted

tt is not enough to discover points that classify
says the expert who faces a world of experts
it is necessary to discover a few that positively
identify the fingerprint experts of today are in-
fatuated with classification rather than identifi-
cation

  so my friend has given to the world something
new others are on the same tack now but i
happen to know that carlson was the one who pio-
neered in this line it is enough to make one wonder
how many men may have been punished for the
crimes of others
io

adventure

  one man has been acquitted in australia already
because of the evidence offered in that court at
valdez by carlson the jury said in effect that
there must be corroborative evidence one man
was executed in america after half a dozen repu-
table men had testified under oath to his presence in
a distant town at the time the crime was committed

  i have seen forged fingerprints in blood on three
cheap butcher-knives all done by carlson for

demonstration he proved forgery in the -

case

  milton carlson showed me his transferred prints
without telling me how it was done at once my
mind cut a caper and i knew how i could do it at
the adventurers club dinner i told milt i could
lift a print off almost anything and place it on an-
other object and he said he was willing to swap
modus operandi with me then he said my method
was one that had never occurred to him but would
surely work perfectly-e e harriman

in the contents page of a past

  i regret i have not the honor to be one of those old
deep water captains of sailing-ship days although i
hold a masters license which unfortunately i shall
never use on this dot in the cosmic universe

at y experiences in sail were gained during
ten years before the mast on board lofty ships
six times around cape horn before i reached my
twentieth year that was a long very long time
ago sometimes memory takes me gently in hand
and leads me back to the utopian days of youth
health and strength when this old world was a great
toy bestowed by an infinite intelligence to compen-
sate those in whom dwelt the restless spirit of adven-
ture not lonesome days to be sure those days of
close friendships and comradeships cemented by
joint ownership of preferred stock in hardships off
cape stiff and rolling weeks running the easting
down common stock - in pleasant trade winds
tropical sunlight and morning watches with wet
decks warm to bare feet and the aroma of coffee and
fried bacon in the air wild nights ashore nights of
sensuous and regretful delights in which the less
than commonplace was changed into an arabian
nights environment by the magic of mind trans-
forming and concentrating into one wild hour the
sacred essence of a life of years

tt seems weird as one recalls it that when sea-
men threw their dunnage into a forecastle and
met for the first time on earth they subconsciously
recognized each other as brothers bestowed and an-
swered to improvised nicknames told of their girls
and heeded respectfully the look here young fel-
low of the oldest man among them to one not
familiar with them it would appear they had all met
before and knew each other well and long at the
end of a voyage while they took their parting drink
as they bid each other farewell in most cases an
eternal farewell as they rarely met again on earth
they silently felt deep in their souls that somewhere
or somehow in the natural course of events they
would meet again consequently their farewells
were optimistic seldom sentimental or sad let us
hope they right gladly meet again-somewhere

  an english poet once said that heaven is love
friendship and comradeship while hell is loneli-
ness and lack of all these it would seem that the
lower hell is the lonesomeness of a great city to
overcome it i read the poets and among them
bill adams prose and poems of the sea even his
prose is poetry which can emanate only from the
great heart of a true man passing loud singing down
the sea he is a voice from the voiceless who have
passed unheard whose inner joys and sorrows re-
main untold and unrevealed until one inspired ap-
pears chanting their sagas-the sagas of the silent
ones who have gone before-b c d

 a letter concerning jujutsu
wrestling and boxing from one of
our own professional wrestlers
mr thorne has been wrestling
instructor at university of michigan de-
troit junior college and college of detroit
and has made a close study of jujutsu as
well as of western wrestling

detroit michigan

  i am very interested in the discussion on jujutsu
after a long life or wrestling study and experiment
i have formed opinions that may differ from many
others on the merits of this art i have wrestled
professionally some fifteen years meeting gotch
zbysko lewis and hundreds of other wrestlers also
for many years challenging all comers among local
strong men in country districts and towns i have
made a long study of all kinds of wrestling and a
close study of judo or jujutsu

rphere is probably no art or sport about which
so little is really known by the average person
and so many wild theories reported as the system
of japanese wrestling and self-defense

  judo or familiarly known as jujutsu incorrectly
called jujitsu is an art combining several branches
of training-physical culture abdominal control and
a wonderful system of defensive and offensive grips
and releases many persons have the conviction
that any japanese wrestler has but to touch the most
herculean westerner and so bring him crashing to
the ground paralyzed and helpless on the other
hand many otherwise well versed athletes sneer at
jujutsu and think they could handle with ease any
jap alive

  both these beliefs are far wrong and have been
proved so time and again american wrestlers have
the camp-fire



defeated time and again japanese experts while now
and then some famous jujutsu expert will gain a vic-
tory over a western wrestler but only when his op-
ponent is clad in judo wrestling dress

    to the farstretched system of supposed nerve
and muscle secrets these are mostly greatly
exaggerated surgeons and anatomists know that
there are no exposed nerves or muscles that can be
lightly struck twisted or handled in any way to
produce paralysis death or even unconsciousness
true there are the sharp hard blows of a fighter on
the jaw a blow to the heart and the neck chop
these actions are however known to most every
one and fail many times

  american wrestlers who spend a lifetime in active
wrestling and know every worth while hold laugh at
the supposed esoteric secrets death-locks and un-
revealed paralyzing combinations

  a famous american light-heavy-weight champion
wrestler edward santel beat the best jujutsu men
on a visit to japan some few years ago

  judo is wonderful against the average man but so
also are catch-as-catch-can and boxing there are
certain fairly sensitive nerves under the ears in the
jaws in the elbows wrists and other parts of the
body but try working holds there on a trained wrest-
ler of any european style and he will laugh at you

hphere are many grades in the japanese wres-
tling system and jujutsu is wrestling and also
many schools in japan that teach the art the
grades run from shodan or first nidan or second
sandan third yodan fourth godan fifth roku-
dan sixth and last the shichidan seventh and
master

  the word or ideograph ju of jujutsu means to
obey or submit and the rest means art or science
judo has the same ideograph while the do means
a road or way

  sumo wrestling in japan is engaged in by big fat
giants called sumi-tori hitachiyama their greatest
champion visited america some years ago but re-
fused to wrestle the american champion frank
gotch

thougii writers for some reason will not place
in their adventure stories champion wrestlers
yet we find tale after tale of a fighter licked with
ease by some captain or most any one who picks a
quarrel with him try it in real life the same
goes for even a fair professional wrestler who i
think is the real man-handier try to handle him
and the bucko-mate the tough guy the hard-hitting
heroes would think they had struck a fighting go-
rilla this is not exaggerated as in mixed matches
between crack boxers and wrestlers the wrestler has
won with ease every time

  any fair wrestler can snap an arm leg wrist or
even a neck but in matches he does not push his
holds but makes his opponent give up through pain
or get a fall

  wrestling is the oldest sport in the world and
though it has been hurt by many fixed matches yet
it has thousands of followers all over the world

  in my own opinion i consider george hacken-
schmidt the greatest wrestler that ever lived and
what he would have done as a stowaway under a
bucko-mate or adventuring in any other place would
have been a story in itself one of the strongest
men in the world quick as chain-lightning and a

past master at wrestling and handling big opponents
he would have caused a fearful scarcity of heroes if
he played the bad man and a like dearth if he was
against the latter-clifford thorne

a word as to the fat gentleman
in actual life whose avoirdupois
kgiilft suggested the avoirdupois of one
of the characters in fred f
fleischers story in this issue

san francisco

  the pasha of mostar was in  still remembered
as abu sharwal the father of wide trousers and i
have heard people sgy that he was so fat that he
could not cross the old roman bridge across the
narenta river-he simply did not fit and could
not get over the narrow arch it must have been
a very funny sight to see him on horseback and i
believe he had to ride a percheron or a raw-boned
pomeranian horse to carry hftn with the excep-
tion of the fact that the horse was not an arabian
the story is truth and i have repeated it as bogdan
told me i wish i could remember more about the
doings of bosnian gypsies they are a tribe within a
tribe but i have forgotten and there is no liter-
ature bearing even remotely on this subject-

        would that the anti-weapon
rv mr  campaigners and other cure-it-
with-a law fanatics could be made
to take so broad and understand-
ing a view of matters

moundsville west virginia

  it is a great pity that our people cannot learn the
view of montesquieu that it may in rare cases be
well to change a law or in extreme cases to make a
new law but that this should always be done as he
puts it with a trembling hand the consequences
of a law can never be foreseen and are often con-
trary to the intent of the law so true is this that
one historian has written no legal enactment ever
benefited commerce unless it was the repeal of laws
passed with the intent to benefit commerce i
quote from memory and the phraseology may be in-
exact but the meaning is correctly given

  one meaning which might profitably be applied to
all intended reform laws is the question how much
harm are we going to do in order to effect the pro-
posed good-l s hughes

bow wood

     a little known species of timber
from argentina which could be used
instead of hickory

  request-can you tell me whether a brazilian
wood called pao darco which is i presume bow
wood in portuguese is exported to the united
states and whether it goes by any other name

  can you tell me the names of some importers of
tropical woods where the h-bove wood might be
secured or other tropical wood suitable for bows-
j m armstrong st paul minn

  reply by mr barbour-pao darco or bow
wood is of the genus tecoma and is the same or
similar species as lapacho found in northern argen-
tina and paraguay where it is used for wagon spokes
and similar purposes

  the wood is very hard and strong about as heavy
as water of a dark yellowish brown color it is
easily recognizable from the fact that it contains
a powdery yellow substance called lapachol which
is very apparent on a freshly sawn surface

  this wood is not imported into the united states
though i believe it could be for uses to which hickory
is now put

  mr alvarez the manager of the brazilian
mining and timber company of  beaver street
can i believe have some sent up for you with other
woods which he imports if you mention my name
when you write him i am sure that he will do what
he can to oblige you

  there are a number of tropical woods suited by
their strength and elasticity for bow-making
among them are bethabara black palm etc manu-
facturers of fishing rods might be able to tell you
where they could be bought

    names and addresses of department
  editors and the exact field covered by
  each section are given in the next

illusion shows in papeete

     the natives are crazy about merry-
 go-rounds but they like anything
that happens in a tent

  request-i have an illusion show which i have
been operating on carnivals in this country i be-
lieve it would go good through the islands and as i
have long wanted to make the trip have concluded
that it would be a good scheme to combine business
with pleasure

  i have a really wonderful show and it is of a nature
that should appeal especially to the native popula-
tion my present plan is to stop at honolulu first
then pago pago then apia samona and next pa-
peete and would like to be in papeete for the cele-
bration during week of july th-bastile week i
believe they call it

  can you put me in touch with some one in charge
of arrangements

  is it possible to ge boat connections for papeete

at either pago pago or apia or must one ship direct
from here

  are accomodations expensive

   is english or french tiie most spoken

   i use cabbage in one of my illusion acts can i se-
cure it in papeete

  any other information as to the best means of
getting to papeete and also as to my chances there
with my show will be greatly appreciated

  there are four people in my organization and i
show in a tent or could use an empty store building
-m flanagan los angeles calif

  reply by mr charles brown-i am of the
opinion that your show would go great in papeete
during the bastille week i do not think tahiti has
ever had an illusion show

  you have planned your itinerary quite well-
honolulu pago pago apia papeete you cannot
make a direct run from samoa to tahita however
it will be necessary to run down to new zealand
and catch a union steamship company steamer for
tahiti

  write to george spitz papeete tahiti society
islands for information pertaining to carnival week
mr spitz who is one of the councilmen of papeete
is always on one or more of the bastille week com-
mittees

  you should be able to buy plenty of cabbage in
papeete for the chinese are growing the stuff in
their hillside truck gardens about an empty store
to show in well if you carry a tent most likely
you will show in it another thing to the native
a tent is a mysterious thing and hell be more than
anxious to get inside too bad you are not carrying

a merry-go-round outfit a native will go to -

dragging the spirits of his fathers fathers along with
him for a ride on a merry-go-round the last outfit
that came through several years ago cleaned up a
young fortune

  french and tahitian are the official languages
but english is pretty well spoken and understood
just the same your living expenses per person will
amount to - a day

   of course you could make papeete your first show-
ing place after which you would work over to
australia in order to make the run to samoa per-
haps you could catch a small schooner out of rara-
tonga over in the cook islands next door to tahiti
i do not know for certain about this

indian arrow-heads

     classifying the stone weapons
of the aboriginal tribes is a compli-
cated piece of work

  request-i have about a half bushel of indian
arrow-heads spear-heads axes and skinning
knives found in the localities mentioned below
and wish to find out something about them so i can
mount the best of them in some systematic or intel-
ligent way these stones vary in size from j inch
long to  inches and are in many different shapes and
sizes

  can you give me any information regarding-

   	what tribes of indians lived in the following
localities-

   a	what is now ashe and boone counties n c
and s w virginia

  b	what is now agusta bath and highland
counties va
ask adventure



  	did the aboriginal tribes make stone arrow-
heads for different purposes such as-one type or
size for warfare another for big game another for
small game birds etc etc

  	did different tribes make different types of
arrow-heads the shape of which would be more or
less characteristic of that tribe

  	what books are available which describe the
customs habits industries arms and implements of
these tribes and to how much detail do they go into
matter which would answer the above questions

  a propos of indian relics i found in ashe county
n c what i believe to be an unusual find i e-a
place where indians had a regular quarry for getting
out soapstone bowls or pots and saw the remnants
of a number of these pots which had been found
by the local mountaineers and secured one fairly
good specimen on one outcrop of soapstone or
pot-stone as often called by the mountaineers i
found where over thirty pots had been chipped
out of the solid stone i had to strip from  inches
to two feet of earth from over the stone to find most
of them of particular interest was one bowl or
pot which was partly finished but still connected to
the bed rock being only partially undercut i
enclose three kodak pictures of the quarry -
h h hutchinson buchanan va

  reply by mr woodward-pardon the delay in
answering your most interesting letter but youll
compree when i tell you that i have been shifting
from coast to coast and have been unable to get at
my reference books until now

  answering query number one the cherokee
tribe roamed the territory now covered by north
carolina and southwest virginia down into south
carolina northern georgia and eastern tennessee

  yes aboriginal tribes did make different arrow
points for war and hunting but they were not always
triballv characteristic stone implements unless
definitely associated with the people of a certain
area are difficult articles to assign with any degree
of definiteness to any one tribe

  for example i have seen delicate leaf-shaped
arrow points from the new england states which
were identical with similar heads picked up in ar-
kansas and in california often the tribe inhabit-
ing a certain territory manufactured its weapons of
the stone or other material best fitted to their needs
and their neighbors having other materials made use
of them in like manner then the two gens would
trade and so the points would become hopelessly
interchanged and only by knowing of the original
nature of the materials used in the separate sections
are we able to distinguish between the artifacts

  dr clark wissler curator of anthropology in the
american museum of natural history new york
commenting on the difficult task of identifying stone
arrow points says in his section on types of arti-
facts in his work the american indian page 

  by paying minute regard to size secondary form
and materials it has been possible to draw some dis-
tinctions between arrow-heads from different parts
of the two continents but such study has not ad-
vanced to a point where a summary can be made
the fact is that the difficulties of observing consis-
tent distinctions are so great as to be discouraging

  so you see how difficult a definite placement of an
artifact is unless we know just where it was found
of what material it is made and we know what
tribes inhabited that section of country

  your knives and lance-heads will be difficult to
tell apart from arrow-heads the only difference be-
ing in size stone drills and scrapers are often mis-
taken for arrow-heads the common shapes of
arrow-heads are the flat based semi-rounding point
the head with a small shank and rounding shoulders
and the notched base type of course there are end-
less variations in these types which it will be needless
to enumerate

  as a rule bird arrows or small game shafts were
seldom tipped with stone or other cutting material
generally a rounded bone or antler point was used
or else the shaft was hardened in the fire this was
done to keep the flesh or plumage from being bruised
and cut

yar arrows were serrated as a rule and the
heads set loosely in the socket of the shaft
with sinew which loosened with blood and left the
head in the wound when the arrow was pulled out
ordinary hunting arrows were generally without
notches along the edge and were set tight in the shaft
points of deer and elk antler were used by some
tribes in preference to stone such heads had great
power of penetration and would not shatter against
bones as would the more brittle stone points but
would drill through rib or shoulder blade like a mod-
ern sharp pointed rifle bullet many desert dwellers
used cane shafts with hard wood for shafts with
minute points i have one of these points which is
as small as my index finger nail yet is sharp as glass
such a head set in a hard wood fore shaft would be
capable of doing great execution as a rule the
indians on coming into contact with the whites gave
over their native points of stone antler bone and
wood and made their arrow-heads of iron copper
brass and tin

  that will give you a general idea of arrow heads
in use among the various tribes

  answering your fourth question i would refer you
to the hand book of the american indian vols 
and  for further information regarding customs
habits weapons etc of the various tribes the
info therein is concise reliable and easily obtained
from the nearest large library to read up on the
cherokees get hold of the fifth annual report of
the bureau of ethnology smithsonian institution
washington d c

  regarding your steatite or soapstone quarry
soapstone was quarried by the aboriginal tribes of
this continent from the appalachian highland of
georgia to new york and in the west particularly
in california being of such a degree of softness
that made chipping or fracturing by alternate heat-
ing and dousing with water unnecessary the steatite
was chiseled and cut out with stone and bone imple-
ments your photos show a typical soapstone
quarry

  other quarries were in flint copper alum tur-
quoise coal for ornaments and dyes catlinite
cinnabar mica salt ocher chert and other flakable
stones

  these quarries were worked extensively and thou-
sands of tools and implements and household uten-
sils were the result at times for some unknown
reason caches of roughly shaped artifacts taken
from these quarries were buried by the makers in
one cache alone unearthed in maryland i believe
there were four thousand discoidal objects of chipped
flint similar large caches of lance heads and knives
have also been discovered by archaeologists
adventure

   well i hope in these few pages i have been able
to give you some idea of the working of flint arti-
facts it is an endless subject and would require
many more pages than i am able to devote to it to
tell in detail the processes of stone implement manu-
facture the hand book will tell you all that

  come again some time

   p s i notice in answering question one i over-
looked a portion of your query regarding mounting
of specimens

  sort them according to size and shape deter-
mine as best you can which are knives which are
lance-heads drills arrow-heads etc forms one
half inch to two inches in length may fairly safely be
classed as arrow-heads make a card noting place
found material used and give each specimen a
number heads may be wired to cards or boards
covered with dark cloth and placed in case mu-
seum collectors laugh at the fanciful arrangements
of indian heads arrow-heads fleur-de-lis and
other shapes outline with so much care by the
amateur collectors learn something about your
specimens and the people who made them and go
about the thing in a systematic way just as you
would if you were running a line with the gun
for some big project blue print work and a
savvy of your subject is as essential in collecting as
a knowledge of triangulation and use of a transit is in
your own line

  gold-hunting in alaska

its a particularly strenuous trip to
the kantishna but there is still some
gold there and some silver too

  request-my partner and myself are planning
a four months trip into the kantishna river district
of alaska will start about the first of september
and will spend the time hunting and prospecting
we have very little knowledge of prospecting or the
geology of the country and would appreciate any in-
formation you can give us on the following

   -what	kind of an outfit will we need for such a
trip in equipment clothes and food we will
ascend to the headwaters of the kantishna by canoe
and will only take the barest necessities

  -what	minerals may we expect to find in that
district and how should we proceed to find them

  -how	should the claim be filed worked or
marketed

  -general	geology necessary for prospector-
clifford c macklin omaha neb

  reply by mr victor shaw-you are certainly
planning some strenuous trip if you are going to the
kantishna i suppose you plan to enter via nenana
on the yukon and from anchorage up the govt
r r the placers on the upper kantishna river
were mostly dredging operations in  the last
year in which govt reports were compiled at
that time there were about  oz of gold recovered
valued at about  the ground averaged
around si per cu yd there were about  mines
working the largest output coming from glenn
creek the next in order were eureka moose little
moose and wickersham there has been quite a

bit of galen found which carries silver but the placer
of that section axe not considered rich

  there are several sourdoughs here who have been
in that section since  they tell me that there
is little prospecting there now they say the old 
properties are idle and deserted

tf you go in id advise you to keep to the west

  when ascending the river pass the branch com-
ing in from lake minchumina and then keep bear-
ing westward up-river this will take you up to the
west and north of mt mckinley which region is
said to be good prospecting youll find spruce
poplar and larch timber with thickets of willow and
alder moss covers everything and most of the
timbe is along creeks or at the base of the hills
there is birch also and much grass the large ani-
mals include moose caribou and bear but they are
rather scarce for some reason not yet known prac-
tically no population white or indian and little or
no hunting smaller fur animals are numerous also
grouse and water fowl quite a bit of rain in that
section

   if you dont find good ground in there work west-
erly to the head of the north fork of the kusko-
quwim river which heads to the west of lake min-
chumina fair placer has been found there and also
at the extreme head of the south fork which is
down near the yentna river

  the ground around the tolovana river which
comes into the yukon above the kantishna and on
the north side is pretty good i am told up around
livengood also at chatanika up the chatanika
river they lie due north from fairbanks

   i enclose a leaflet which will give you a general
idea of outfit as far as tools go youll need furs for
the winter up there also dogs if you intend any winter
traveling youll get the proper craft for working
up-river at nenana you can tent in summer and
locate a patch of timber and build a solid cabin for
winter packing in the necessary stove i wouldnt
bother taking anything except guns and some heavy
clothing with you get your outfit up at nanena
you havent said whether you will go via yukon
river steamer or via r r in the case of the
steamer it would perhaps pay you to take most of
your outfit with you via steamer youd get off at
tanana and go up that river past hot springs
there is a tin mine near hot springs the minerals
you find up the kantishna are gold silver lead cop-
per gray copper or tetra hedrite so far as is now
known

   you must file your claims at the nearest land office
probably at nenana or hot springs you can take
 acres of placer or  x  feet on a lode claim
better get wilsons mining laws  at your
bookstore or  wilcox bldg los angeles calif

if you will also send  to the latter address for
the miners guide it will tell you how to work a
claim as to marketing sell your gold to the nearest
gold-buyer

 what a yeoman does

      good pay and excellent opportuni-
ties for promotion make this a desir-
able branch of naval life

  request-if it would not be too much trouble i
wish you would assist me in the following

   where is it possible to get copies of naval regula-
tions
ask adventure



  would also like to locate a book on drills

  the reason that i am in search of such information
is that in the course of a few months i intend to en-
list as a yeoman anything that you may have in
regards to this branch of service will be greatly ap-
preciated by me

  am enclosing an addressed and stamped envelope
for your convenience-joseph drager oshkosh
wis

  reply by lieutenant greene-a naval yeoman
is a clerk the duties of the rating are very similar to
those of clerks in civilian life in addition to these
duties he has stations at various drills that are con-
nected with battle and the safety of the ship fire
collision general quarters abandon ship etc gen-
eral quarters mean a station for battle it is impos-
sible to say in advance just what these stations may
be

  a yeoman ranks as a petty officer of rd class nd
class st class chief acting appointment chief per-
manent appointment the pay of these ratings are
rd class  per month nd class  per
month st class  per month chief acting ap-
pointment  per month chief permanent ap-
pointment  per month these amounts are
base pay for the first four years to compute the
pay for the second four years add  of this base
pay for the third four add  for the fourth add
 and for service after  years add  for
instance base pay of chief petty officer  to
compute pay after  years service add  
of  equals  plus  is  which is
the pay of a chief after  years service

  promotion up to the rank of yeoman st class is
fairly fast depending of course on efficiency and
conduct of late owing to reductions in the navy
men in all ranks have had to wait for a long time to
promotion to chief though it is certain to come in
the end if you wish to stay in the navy for a long
time promotion to the commissioned officer rank is
open to you in this case leading through the war-
rant officer rank of pay clerk and from that to en-
sign the last being a commissioned officer of the
same relative rank as that of nd lieutenant in the
army after getting the first commission if one
applies themselves to the business of getting it there
is nothing to keep them from reaching the highest
rank

  while a knowledge of shorthand is not required
it is a very good thing for a yeoman to have skill in
there are not many yeomen that know anything
about it and knowing it may lead eventually to ap-
pointment as secretary to an admiral this is really
the cream of the jobs that a yeoman can hold and
makes promotion very sure

  upon entry into the navy you will be supplied
with uniforms and other clothing that will give you
a good start after this you will then have to buy
your own clothes these can be purchased from
the navy very much cheaper than you can buy the
same grade of goods ashore

  there is one thing that i should like to mention
though if you wish to take a little advice from an
old timer in the outfit give it long and serious
thought before you sign a four year contract with
the navy and remember that you are going to make
an entire change in the manner of living that you are
used to it is a very exacting service the discipline
is very strict and one has to make good before one
will get anywhere i mention this not because i

wish to frighten you but because i have seen many
men go on the rocks they could not make it go and
landed upon the list of deserters or with an undesir-
able discharge

por my part i consider the navy a very good
place you can depend that they are abso-
lutely on the level in their dealing with the men
the only formula for getting along there is try to
learn all you can about the navy and your own
work keep a good conduct sheet and your appear-
ance neat and clean

  now about the books that you mention the
regulations are not available for purchase but if you
will address the u s naval institute annapolis
md you can get the following official books that
cover the navy and drills

  the bluejackets manual th ed  pages
price 

  this covers description of the duties of a navy
man better than any book that i know of and is writ-
ten by a naval officer

   other books that cover all the drills of the navy

are

the boat book 

ship and gun drills

the landing force manual 

order these from the same place

   if there is anything else that i can advise you on
write and let me know what it is i will always be
glad to answer

  when you get something for nothing
dont make the other fellozv pay the post-
age on it

subsidiary they have quite a plant at barranca

now and then they ship men down and they might
make you an offer if you told them you had experi-
ence in the tropics and if not they might direct you
to some one who would employ you the pay is
good and conditions are about like they were on the
big ditch the dutch shell and several other com-
panies are operating in several places but this is the
best bet if you want a voluminous account of all
the oil operations in colombia write joseph sinclair
 fifth ave new york n y and ask him for his
booklet oil development in colombia he and
a friend mapped parts of colombia and ecuador for
an oil syndicate and he knows more about it than
any one i know

  the gold strike in french and british guiana
seems to be more wind than anything else there
always has been a bit of gold mined in both coun-
tries but neither has ever compared with colombia
as a gold producer colombia has regularly exported
about a million a month for the past twenty years
and before that many hundreds of millions more

  wm morlock now operating a mine at el borde
cauca colombia says that prospects are good in his
neighborhood and he might be a good man to tie
to he will answer a letter from you if you mention
my name they are getting it out in a thousand

hunting in idaho

     deer cougar bear lynx elk
vp moose and mountain goat make this
a sportsmans paradise there is plenty of
fishing besides and the scenery is grand

  request-for years i have spent my vacation
deer hunting in northern california in the klamath
river district have experienced years of good and
bad hunting but as a whole after a great deal of
hard work have been fairly well satisfied

  new hunters join our crowd and are forever making
comparisons with other hunting grounds we have
heard much of hunting in idaho and if our new mem-
ber is not exaggerating the hunting is far better in
idaho than at our old stamping grounds we have
discussed a change but have been unable to reach a
decision we desire some authentic information
and also a definite hunting location hence i am
taking advantage of the privilege granted to adven-
ture magazine subscribers and putting the problem
up to you

  to be brief

  a	trip to be made by automobile from san fran-
cisco in november

  b	must not exceed three weeks

  c	deer and small game hunting desired but if
possible would like to get into an elk and bear country

  d	on account of limited time do not wish to pack
in would much rather if possible to get good hunt-
ing make camp with the automobile

  it appears to me that answers to the following
questions would enable us to reach a decision

  	do you consider that the hunting is better in
any certain part of idaho than in the klamath river
district california

  	if so what part

  	is it possible in three weeks time to make a
hunting trip to this location in idaho from san fran-
cisco by automobile and have at least ten days hunt-
ing

  	if packing-in is necessary please if possible
advise me of a man from whom horses etc could
be procured

  	please inform me the route to the hunting
grounds from a city or town in idaho shown on the
map

  the above information will be greatly appreciated
and i will thank you very much for your trouble

  if you desire to publish this letter please do not

  reply by mr newman-in answer to your letter
of the nd inst i wish to refer you to several coun-
ties in northern idaho as this territory is considered
a hunters paradise

  boundary county

  the scenery to be found in this county is the equal
of any in the west its snowcapped mountains
green treed gulches and snow water creeks are won-
derfully attractive this county is also a sports-
mans paradise the mountains are well denizened
with cougar bear lynx and all kinds of smaller ani-
mals in fact many people earn their livelihood
during the winter season by trapping within not
more than  miles from bonners ferry the
streams and lakes are well-filled with mountain
trout char bass sturgeon whitefish and ling and
are being yearly restocked by the hatchery within
 miles of bonners ferry you go to bonners
ferry to get to the hunting grounds in this county

  clearwater county

  the bitterroot mountains are widely known for
their unsurpassed beauty and as a recreation ground
for hunters and fishermen hundreds of tourists
and sportsmen visit the county annually

  the north fork and its tributaries are among the
best trout streams of the northwest deer elk
mountain goat moose and bear frequent the higher
ranges go to lewiston or orofino idaho to reach
the hunting grounds in this county

  idaho county

  the vast mountainous county east and south of
grangeville idaho is a wonderful big game and fish-
ing country and is the sportsmans paradise those
parties desiring to hunt large game can procure
guides and supplies at this point with unlimited
wood water and horse food throughout the moun-
tain territory

  latah county go to moscow

  this county has some of the finest scenery in the
west ranging from the lofty timbered mountains in
the east to the rolling prairies in the west the
swift flowing mountain streams abound in trout
big game is found in the timbered regions game
birds such as chinese hungarian timber pheasants
prairie chickens grouse and other game birds afford
good sport to the lover of the great out-doors

  referring to your question one i can not say as i
have never been in the state of california but i sug-
gest you hunters try idaho once and in the territory
i have described
ask adventure



  if you have a good car and good roads and do not
strike any snow in november you should be able to
get ten days hunting in idaho

  regarding game license it is unlawful for any
person to have in his or her possession any uncased
shotgun or rifle in a field or forest of the state of
idaho without first having procured a license the
non-resident big game hunting license in this state
is  the non-resident bird license is  and
the non-resident fishing license  there is
nothing in the law to prohibit any person from carry-
ing sidearms for the protection of life and property
additional information can be secured from mr

  to the northward of the main land of spanish
honduras in the bay of the same name there is a
cluster of islands lying nearly parallel to the coast
at a distance from it of from thirty to fifty miles
their names in the order of their size are roatan
sometimes written ruatan and rattan guanaja
or bonacca utilla barbarettahelenaand morat
dependent upon them are numerous coral islets or
cays of small size these islands have good soil
fine climate advantageous position and some of
them have excellent harbors rendering them both
valuable and important to that portion of the con-
tinent upon which they are geographically depen-
dent

  roatan the largest of these islands is about thirty
miles long by nine wide at widest point quoting
from various visitors to these islands

  it may be considered as a key of the bay of hon-
duras and the focus of the trade of the neighboring
countries

  this beautiful island has an excellent harbor
easily defended and is well adapted to the culture of
cotton coffee and other tropical products

  the local position of the island seems one of im-
portance in a commercial world and perhaps in a
political point of view it is the only place where
good harbors are found on an extensive and danger-
ous coast

  its proximity to central america and spanish
honduras seems to point it out as a good depot for
the worlds goods and manufactures where they
would find a ready market even in opposition to any
duties placed on them

  roatan and bonacca in consequence of their
fine harbors good soil pure air and great quantities

of animals fish and fruits and commanding ground
are proverbially known in that part of the world as

the garden of the west indies the key to span-
ish america and a new gibraltar

  from their natural strength they might be made
impregnable being tenable with a very small force
here are found great quantities of coconuts wild
figs and excellent grapes the forests produce
white oaks and pine-trees fit for masts of merchant
ships it abounds with deer wild hogs indian rab-
bits and birds of many species a constant breeze
from the east cools and tempers the air and there is
abundance of excellent water

  the island is one beautiful mass of evergreens
from the shore to the tops of the hills interspersed
with many coconut gardens and there are many
patches of coffee which although in some parts
abandoned yet continue to thrive well

  limestone is the principal formation there are
also sandstone and quartz and a great deal of coral
on the lower parts the island seems originally to
have been elevated by a volcanic eruption and the
lower portions washed up by the subsequent action
of the sea on the coral formations sand has been
thrown up then decayed vegetable matter and
seeds drifted or brought by birds from the conti-
nent and surrounding lands these springing up
and decaying have assisted in forming a beautiful
soil on which man has at length landed erected his
dwelling and has found the land subservient to his
wants this applit to the lower portions of the island
only

  so far no minerals have been collected on these
islands

  the island has a singularly beautiful appearance
at a distance as you approach it in a ship the
mountains rise in a gradual height to the summit of
nine hundred feet and they seem successively to
follow each other intersected by valleys the whole
thickly and most luxuriously wooded as you draw
near to it you discover that palm and coconut-trees
encircle the shores and forest trees of various des-
cription grow on the higher hills the natural
beauty of its appearance is greatly enhanced when
you cast anchor in one of its many harbors on the
southern side

  in the valleys alluvial deposits and decayed
vegetable matter form the soil which is exceedingly
rich and deep on the mountains and their de-
clivities a red clay or marl predominates

  a great deal of good and useful timber is found
spontaneously growing on the island such as santa
maria wood extensively used for ship-building
three varieties of oak cedar spanish elm and lance-
wood and the shores are lined and surrounded with
groves of coconut-trees a tree which in administer-
ing to the wants of man is hardly surpassed in trop-
ical regions

  at present the island produces in abundance
coconuts plantains yams bananas pine-apples
etc but probably bread-fruit and vegetables and
many kinds of fruits and vegetables of the temporate
regions will grow here

  the country is capable of raising all tropical pro-
ductions such as sugar coffee tobacco etc which
might become staple commodities of export

  there was found on the island of roatan pre-
vious to its being inhabited a great quantity of deer
wild hogs rabbits parrots pigeons and birds of
various descriptions

  in years past previous to its settlement men


adventure

from small vessels and fishing boats resorted to this
island for the purpose of supplying themselves with
game

  a great quantity of domestic animals are now
raised cattle might also be raised

  it seems probable that the islands at some re-
mote period were thickly inhabited by the indian
race for in clearing away the land for plantations
many domestic and culinary utensils have been
found there is a tradition that the spaniards in
accordance with their system of cruelty on their
first discovery of america depopulated these islands
of the original people seizing upon the aborigines
taking them to the continent to work in the mines
from whence they never returned

a great deal of rain falls in the winter months
    from september to february

  this has the effect of cooling the air beyond what
is felt in the other parts of the west indies and the
breeze tempers the influence of the sun

  if the people could keep themselves dry and free
from damp the climate must not only be exceedingly
agreeable but singularly pure and healthy

  the dry months are much warmer the natives
however do not complain of the heat they say that
it is the healthiest portion of the year the ther-
mometer during january averaged  degrees f

  rheumatism is very common and also a species
of low fever or ague this latter probably arises from
the land not being sufficiently cleared away and
from a luxuriant and decaying vegetation the form-
er malady from constant damp and exposure

  the climate is really healthy not only to those
born in warm latitudes but also to those of temper-
ate climates for with proper precautions they could
not only have health but live to good old age

  the population is scattered along the whole sea-
shore of this island as they find these different loca-
tions more convenient than in the interior here
they erect their dwellings in the midst of their palm
and plantain groves having their little vessels and
fishing-boats in quiet and sheltered nooks and con-
vey their produce and seek for their wants by water-
carriage at coxen hole old name was port
mdonald the greatest numbers are located it is a
safe and sheltered harbor yet chance seems to have
directed them in the first instance to this spot as
there are other and better locations for a township
the mass of the population is composed of the de-
scendants of liberated slaves from grand cayman
and a small portion of the inhabitants are colored
people also natives of that island and formerly
slave-owners

  the dark population or those who were formerly
slaves from their physical powers and their habits
of labor from childhood soon surpassed the white
population in the accumulation of the means of exis-
tence and are now the most thriving and successful
if riches be estimated from mans wants being easily
supplied and the accumulation of more than he re-
quires these people are not only wealthy but in far
better circumstances than many of those who are
relieved from manual labor in other countries

the mass of the population is a fine race they
are strong active and athletic temperate
quiet and regular in their habits not given to excess

  their occupation consists in cultivating their
grounds and plantations fishing turtling etc
necessity in all countries and in the first rude ages

of civilization has been fertile in invention conse-
quently it is by no means extraordinary to find the
mass of these people familiar with those rude mech-
anical arts of which they stand so much in need
every man erects his own dwelling plants and lays
out his ground most of them are carpenters and
some are good rope-makers they have a knowl-
edge of boat and ship building also the making of
lime etc and other useful attainments their
dwellings are well and comfortably made

rjhe trade carried on by them in plantains coco-
nuts pine-apples etc which same trade is
steadily increasing the articles mentioned are taken
to new orleans in exchange for lumber dry and salt
provisions etc

  dixons cove is a good harbor is about six miles
east of coxen hole and in some respects is a better
harbor as a ship can run into this harbor and ground
upon the soft mud without injury for repairs etc
and it is big enough so that many ships can find an-
chorag there

  another harbor is port royal which is a larger
basin but its entrance is very narrow this being its
drawback and the land is not so fertile

  these harbors are surrounded by reefs of coral
their channels are narrow and ought never to be
attempted by strangers but a local knowledge is
easily obtained the channels between the reefs
are deep and show themselves by the blueness of
the water

the following song donald monroe or two
sons of north britain comes to the depart-
ment from mr ray judy of seattle washington
it has suffered much in the process of being passed
on for years from singer to singer but is in better
condition than several other texts that have come
in i requested mr judy to make no attempt to
straighten out the rhymes or the constructions
and he has sent the text just as he heard it sung

of its history he says in part my grandfather
charles emerson was born in erie pennsylvania
but moved to canada when a mere child and i sup-
pose learned and sung the song in ontario canada
he sang it sixty years ago

donald monroe

of all the sons of north britain those wishing to
     roam

to seek foreign countries and lands that are strange

among the vast number was donald monroe

and he to america was forced to go

his two sons with his brother was forced to stay
because of their passage they could not well pay

and seven years being over and long passed away
they went to their uncle one day all alone

to see if he would grant them to cross them oer
    the main

that they with their parents in plenty might remain

but their uncle replied them and answered them
    no

for since you have no money you can not go

their minds being disturbed no rest could they
    find

the thoughts of the army still run in their minds

and walking along till once they had found
a regiment of soldiers for america was bound

with whom they enlisted and soon took the main
in order to see their dear parents again

but when they had landed in this country so wild
surrounded by rebels on every side

with humble submission the two of them went
to their kind captain to beg of his consent

to let them up the country their parents for to see
with whom their kind captain with them did agree

on leaving the tent they took a boy for their guide
to show them the place where their parents resided

they were walking along when one of them said
oh could we but find our dear parents to-day

im sure it will surprise them to find us so near
for that of our enlisting they have not yet heard

and walking little farther they came to a grove
where the trees and the bushes all seemed to

   move-

there being two rebels a-lurking in the woods

and pointing their pieces where the two brothers
    stood

and lodging their bullets all into their breast
they ran to their prey like some ravenous beast

to rob them of their money and strip them of their

    clothes-

one of them not being dead they gave him some
    blows

he cried oh you cruel monsters you blood-thirsty

    hounds

how could you have killed us till once we had found

its of our dearest parents whom we have long
    sought with care

im sure when they hear this theyll die in despair

they left us in scotland some seven years ago
perhaps you may know them their name is mon-
roe

the old man being their father he stood in amaze
his heart filled with sorrow with grief and surprise

crying where shall i wander this sight to shun
oh curse be my hands i have murdered my sons

oh are you our father the young man cried
im glad that ive seen you before that i died

oh how is dear mother and is she quite well

im sure when she hears this her poor heart will
    swell

oh who is that young man that lies by your side
what is his name and where does he reside

its my beloved brother and your beloved son
the loss would have been less had i fallen alone

but there is one advice ill give you before that i
     die

its leave off rebellion in time and be wise

and perhaps we may meet on some happier shore
where you wont be able to kill us any more

	adventure

as thus he had spoken and down dropped his head
the old man examined him and found he was dead

he kissed their bodies as cold as the clay
and cursed his misfortunes on that fatal day

crying why did i the rebels join to assist in this
    bad cause

to kill my own children against natures laws

ill grieve out my sorrow give way to despair
and burst out my life till death ends my care

its probable that there exist other versions of
this song still sung by the older generation of men
id like much to obtain such versions and to know
where when and by whom they were sung

and who can add more to the following fragment
that came in the other day from a correspon-
dent in montana

im a rambler and a gambler and far from my home
and those that dont like me can leave me alone

im a-leaving a-leaving a-leaving cheyenne
with a pack on old baldy and riding old dan

i eat when im hungry i drink when im dry

and if whisky dont kill me ill live till i die

oh whisky and beer they are nothing to me

they killed my old dad now they can try me

go way from my window come in at my door

i know you drink moonshine you did once before

my wife does not worry my children dont ball
im as happy as one who keeps bachelors hall
