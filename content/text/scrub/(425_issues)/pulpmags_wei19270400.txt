foreword

     ome of my present readers
will doubtless remember the
girl in the golden atom
when i wrote that book of the realm
of infinite smallness there was in my
mind its logical converse the realm
of the infinitely large the one a
complement to the other and so i
offer explorers into infinity in
no sense as a sequel to the girl in
the golden atom for fictionally
they have no connection but rather
as its companion story

  you will find here a complete
theory of the material universe as i
conceive it may perhaps really be
to my own imagination-and i
think very likely to your own-it is
difficult to conceive of an infinite dis-
tance beyond the stars-empty space
stretching out forever nor is ein-
stein more satisfying to me rather
less so for out beyond the einstein

system of curved space must lie
something or nothing it is the
nothingness which puzzles me i
have tried vainly to imagine a realm
infinitely large of unending nothing-
ness time is equally puzzling i
can conceive of eventful eons lying
ahead of us but rob that time of its
future events and i flounder to me
at least the conception of time with
nothing ever happening anywhere is
impossible to me also an event
presupposes the existence of some-
thing and so in my effort to imagine
the infinitely large-space illimit-
able time unending-i am forced to
conceive what must fill that space
what must happen to create that
time

  you may call this tale fantastic
weird bizarre doubtless it is but
with our most powerful microscopes
reaching inward so tiny a distance to
see no end in infinite smallness our
greatest telescopes groping futilely


weird tales

out into largeness unending to our
vision what is left but our imagina-
tion and that at least we can
send winging into the infinite

  i would not have you fear from
this foreword that my story may be
some pedantic heavily technical ex-
position it is not for it is fiction
only-a romance with which to enter-
tain you an effort by using fictional
methods to reduce theories purely
imaginative into concrete form with
as great a degree of plausibility as
may be it is this only i desire to
carry you with me as you read to
make plausible this flight of our
imaginations momentarily set free
from the tiny everyday universe
which is all we have physically to
envisage

freedom in time and space

iwas busy with the martian mail
which had just arrived when the
message from brett gryce reached
me i did not apprehend that there
was anything of secrecy about it
since he was using the open air yet
there was in his voice a note of tense-
ness and his summons was urgent

  i cant come brett until i get
through the mail i was rushed
and in a mood of ill-temper at the
universe in general

  when will that be he demand-
ed

  i dont know its aeeursedly
large most of it seems to call for
radio distribution-these martians
are always in a hurry

  come when you ean he said
quietly

  tonight

  yes-tonight no matter how
late-i must see you frank

  ill come i said and cut him
off

it was long past trinight with

dawn beginning to brighten the sky
beyond the masonry of lower great-
new york when i had disposed of
those miserable martian dispatches
the gryces lived in the southern
pennsylvania area my aeroear was
at hand i had rather planned to
use it but i was tired and in no
mood for effort i decided to take
the pneumatic since there was a
branch-little traveled it is true-
which would drop me within some
twenty kilometers of the gryce home

  they gave me an individual cylin-
der with a bed if i cared to sleep i
did not i lay there wondering what
brett could want of me pleased also
that i would see francine-dear lit-
tle frannie

  occasionally i would call the
director ahead they are sometimes
careless in the switching of special
individual cylinders and i had no
wish to pass the branch and find my-
self bringing up at some gulf ter-
minal with half the morning getting
back once i called brett he
would meet me with his aero at the
end of the branch when i arrived
he too reminded the director a
surly sort of fellow the gryces had
already reported him to the general
traffic staff of great-london

  i was not misdirected however
but it was broad daylight when i
emerged to find brett impatiently
awaiting me and in a few minutes
more we were landing at the aero-
stage beside the gryce home

  it was a simple enough place-for
all dr gryces reputed wealth an
estate of a few kilometers set in a
heavy grove of trees with a high
metallic wall about it the granite
house itself was small unpretentious
there were few outbuildings one a
large rectangular affair which vague-
ly i understood was a workshop i
had never been in it i knew old
dr gryce was interested in science
in his day he had materially ad-
vanced civilization with several
explorers into infinity



fundamental devices but what-if
anything-he might be doing now i
had no idea

  brett would tell me nothing be-
yond the fact that his father had sug-
gested they send for me but he
seemed excited tense dr gryce
greeted me with his familiar kindli-
ness though i did not see as much
of this family as i would like my
business with the interplanetary
mails was wholly underpaid and
miserably confining yet i counted
the gryees among my closest friends

  dr gryce said we are very glad
to see you prank come outside
frannie is preparing breakfast

  his manner was grave and quiet
as always but there was about him
also an air of tenseness and an
aspect of apprehension and it
struck me a sort of weary resigned
depression which suddenly made his
years sit more heavily upon him he
was a man of some eighty odd and
though for him no more than twenty
or thirty years of life could be antici-
pated i had never considered him
really old he was small slight of
frame but erect sturdy and vigor-
ous a smooth-shaven face with no
more lines upon it than a keen intel-
lect and a character once wholly
forceful would engrave and a mass
of snow-white shaggy hair to make
his head appear preternaturally
large

  he seemed old now however with
that sense of depression hanging
upon him and an indefinable
aspect of fear

  i must allot a word to picture the
three children of dr gryce mother-
less since childhood brett was now
twenty-eight-three years older than
myself and physically my opposite

i	am short slender and rather dark
and-so they tell me-not too even
of temper brett was a blond young
giant crisp wavy blond hair blue
eyes and the strong-featured ruddy
face of a handsome athlete but not

too handsome for there was upon
him no consciousness of his essential-
ly masculine beauty he was won-
derfully good-natured his was a
ready hearty laugh he looked at
life often from the humorous view-
point but he had also a touch of his
fathers grave dignity and a keen
intellect and a soberness of thought
and reason far beyond his years

  the two other children-martynn
and francine-were twins now just
seventeen alike physically and
temperamentally as children of a
birth traditionally should be slim
and rather small-martynn about my
height francine somewhat shorter
both blue-eyed with blond hair
francines hair was long-waving
tresses which she wore generally in
plaits over her shoulders martynns
was short and curly they were
rather alike of feature a delicacy of
mold which gave to martynn a girl-
ishness but not an effeminacy for
he was a young daredevil and his
sister hardly a lesser one in child-
hood and adolescence an impish spirit
of deviltry had always seemed to
possess these twins a spirit of mis-
chief which had made them a great
trial to their father it had turned
now that they were nearing maturity
into an apparent desire for reckless
adventure-the product of abound-
ing health and bubbling irrepres-
sible good nature they adored each
other were constantly together with
youthful escapades threatening limb
and life and complete disaster out
of which they would emerge or be
extricated with dauntless spirits un-
perturbed

  the greater maturity of woman-
hood at seventeen had brought to
frannie moments of gentleness
sweetness and a simple dignity but
they were brief moments and no
more than a word or look from her
twin was needed to dispel them
martt himself was without a vestige
of dignity but they were no fools


weird tales

these twins they could upon strict
necessity give sober intelligent
thought to any problem at hand
martynn had won honors at the
great-london university  but of
sober matured action they were in-
capable fearless - unreasonably
fearless but irresistible likable
and apparently quite capable of be-
ing restrained a word from dr
gryce or from brett-and to a less-
er extent from me who had known
them from childhood-brought in-
stant though often very temporary
obedience they considered them-
selves quite grown up now in truth
at seventeen frannie was to my eyes
a really beautiful young woman

ii

we sat in a little arbor beside
the house with its breakfast
table already laid dr gryce brett
and myself martt was with fran-
nie preparing the meal it was evi-
dence of the simplicity which marked
the gryce household in these days
of mechanical devices for almost
everything-and the usual multipli-
city of servants-there was not a meal
prepared for dr gryce save by his
daughter

  i was very curious to learn why
they had sent for me but i had no
need to question for at once dr
gryce plunged into it

  i hope frank that you can stay
-well at least a few days with us
can you

  i stared the day officer of the
manhattan interplanetary postal
division was undoubtedly already in
a rage at my absence i said so a
few days dr gryce i dread every
conjunction that brings these ac-
cursed mails-my divisional officers
think its a crime even to eat or sleep
when a planet is near us

  he smiled i imagine i can fix
it

  then ill stay of course if you

could fix the planetary orbits so that
they were parabolas dr gryce it
would suit me exactly

  he and brett both were smiling
but dr gryces smile was momen-
tary for at once that indefinable air
of trouble returned to him

  frank he said i hardly know
how to begin telling you what we
have done-are about to do it
seems curious also-i know it will
striko you so you have been such a
friend to me and my children-that
during all these years we have given
you no hint of our purpose

  we have told no one brett put
in no one in the world

  i said nothing but my curiosity
increased it was doubtless of grave
import this thing they had to tell
me the solemnity earnestness which
stamped them both was unmistakable

  for a moment dr gryce was
silent then he said abruptly you
know frank all my life i have been
engaged with science in a measure
i have been successful there are a
few devices which will bear my name
when i am gone

  i nodded  i know that very well
dr gryce

  but all those things he added
earnestly all that i stand for to
the world has really been of little
importance to me my main labor
goal dream if you will i have never
told anyone-not a living person ex-
cept my children for ten years past
brett has been helping me and
though you would hardly believe it
for the last year or two martt and
frannie have been of material aid in
the accomplishment of my purpose
what branch of science i
asked and youve accomplished
it youre ready to give it to the
world

  accomplished it-yes but we
are not ready to give it to the world
-perhaps we never shall there
would be evil in it-evil diabolical-
in untrained or unscrupulous hands
explorers into infinity



but we are ready to test it-a prac-
tical test tpnight frank my boy
brett is going upon an adventure

  the fear which had been lurking
in his eyes leaped to stamp his other
features he was afraid for brett-
afraid of this thing they were going
to do he had stopped abruptly and
more quietly he added

  i want you to understand me
frank and so for a moment we
must be wholly theoretical this
thing we are about to do involves the
construction of our whole material
universe you know of course that
no limit has been found to the divisi-
bility of matter   

  his sudden question confused me
you mean i stammered that
things can be infinitely small
that there is no limit to small-
ness brett put in an atom-an
electron-they are mere words
within them conceivably might be a
space with stars planets suns-
worlds of their own so tiny that com-
pared to the space in which they
roam that space would seem-and
would be-illimitable picture that
frank and picture upon one of
those worlds inhabitants of propor-
tionate smallness what would they
see feel or think of the universe
would they not conceive it about as
we do picture them with power-
ful microscopes looking downward
into the matter composing their
world they would be aware of
molecules atoms-they would gaze
down into space unending another
realm within their own and within
that one-others and yet others to
infinity the conception confuses
you frank it need not each of
those realms is tiny-or large-ac-
cording to the viewpoint there can
be no such thing as absolute size
that is what i mean dr gryce
interrupted eagerly absolute size
-how can you conceive it you can
not a thing is large or small only

in relation to something else smaller
or larger

  he waved his hand to the rolling
landscape with the morning light and
shadow upon it visible through the
arbor

    there is our everyday world
frank how big is it you can not
say millimeters meters kilometers
helans light-years-those are only
words with which we designate a com-
parison compared to what our
microscopes show us this world of
ours is very large but compared to
the spaces between the stars-the
stars themselves-it is very small
try then to imagine its absolute size
you can not because there is no such
thing a universe within what we
call an atom-another realm within
an atom of matter upon one of the
worlds of that universe-is not an
extraordinary state of smallness un-
til we compare it with ourselves

  and this world of ours it is
normal to us of no absolute size
whatever-neither large nor small-
until we compare it to something else
but suppose we visualize larger
realms suppose we say these plan-
ets stars-all the starry universe
within our ken and this visual space
which contains them-suppose we
imagine all that to be contained with-
in the atom of a particle of matter of
some comparatively still larger
realm at once our world and our-
selves shrink into smallness where
a moment ago we had seemed large
now we seem small yet that other
gigantic world within which we are
contained-if we could live in it our
telescopes would show us still larger
space unending we would feel tiny
-and of actuality we would be tiny
-contemplating space and size so
much larger

  and there you have infinity of
space brett added as his father
paused unending space both
smaller and larger than ourselves
we-everything of which we can be


weird tales

physically aware-represent no more
than a single step in the ladder which
has no bottom nor no top yon can
not conceive an end in either direc-
tion there is no such thing nor
-as father says-can you declare
anything to be small or large con-
sidered by itself alone this then is
space as we conceive it to be il-
limitable unending--infinite space
the conception momentarily
seemed wholly beyond my grasp
what i would have answered when
for a moment dr gryce and brett
paused i do not know for from the
house the approaching voices of
martt and frannie reached us

  youll fall i tell you frannie
give me that  

  i wont

  youll trip over the wires and
youll fall and smash it

  i wont

  the sound of a crash and martts
voice there i told you

  they were upon us wheeling the
tray laden with breakfast martt
flushed laughing oh hello frank
-they didnt switch you wrong did
they frannie broke the heater coils
-if the breakfast gets cold dont
blame me  

  and frannie also flushed and
laughing and a trifle rueful over the
mishap dressed in a blue blouse
and widely flaring knee- ength
trousers with her golden hair toss-
ing on her shoulders the picture of
a little housewife of early morning

  -piiat frank is our conception
  t of the infinity of space

  with breakfast finished brett had
resumed the discussion we were all
seated in the arbor martt and fran-
nie momentarily were quiet seeming-
ly keenly interested in the impression
upon me which they anticipated

would come from their fathers dis-
closures

  dr gryce said the idea of time
unending is indissolubly bound with
the concept of infinite space you
will realize frank for some cen-
turies it has been understood that
time and space are inextricably
blended we think instinctively of
space as a tangible entity-of length
breadth and thickness and of time
as intangible such really is not the
case space has three dimensions-
but time also has a dimension

  length martt put in it
sounds like a play on words but
 

  it isnt frannie finished for
him i cant imagine anything
clearer than that time has length

  dr gryce ignored them you
must understand also that time as
we conceive it can not exist except
as the measurement of a length be-
tween two events and what is an
event it presupposes the existence
of matter does it not matter thus
is introduced into the universe it
also can not be independent of time
and space so long as anything
material exists there must be space
for it to exist in and time to mark
the passing of its existence

  of our universe then we now
have matter time and space there
is a fourth-shall i say element it
also is interdependent with each of
the other three it is motion you
know of course that there can be no
such thing as absolute motion

  or absolute time frannie put
in

  that we will discuss later dr
gryce said quickly since it is more
intricate of conception absolute mo-
tion is impossible and non-existent
we can say a thing moves fast or
slowly only in relation to the move-
ment of something else one word
more i want you to realize frank
how wholly dependent each of these
factors is upon the other matter
explorers into infinity



for instance is an entity persisting
in space and time motion is the
simultaneous change of the position
of matter in space and time a
thing was here then it is there now
that is motion you see how yoti
can not deal with one without in-
volving the others

  say father why dont you tell
him what were going to do martt
demanded   frank listen-tonight
brett and i-

  but im going too frannie de-
clared

  youre not

  i saw again that look of fear in old
dr gryces eyes his children-the
spirit of youth with its lust for ad-
venture-they were eager and ex-
cited but dr gryce saw beyond
that-saw the danger  

  he said gravely there is no pos-
sibility of my making you under-
stand the details frank until we
have gone into the matter thoroughly
but as martt implies you are no
doubt impatient i will tell you then
briefly that for most of my life i
have been delving into this subject-
matter space time and motion il-
limitable longing to investigate
this immense material universe which
i believe exists but we humans are
fettered frank like an ant living
for a brief moment enchained with a
cobweb to a twig and trying to en-
visage the earth

  his voice now was trembling with
emotion   i was satisfied to see
with my own eyes some little part
into infinity i invented what we-
my children and i-call the myrdo-
scope i will explain it presently
suffice it now to say that there are
normally invisible rays akin to light
crossing space and i have made
them visible we captured them-
saw after a myriad trials unavailing
occasional vague glimpses of the be-
yond which came to us it might
have satisfied me but three years
ago one night brett saw-

  he paused looking at brett martt
and frannie were breathless with
eyes fixed on me

  brett said and his voice had a
queer solemn hush to it i was
looking through the myrdoscope we
had seen blurred brief glimpses of a
realm-

 beyond the stars frannie
breathed

  yes beyond the stars a realm
seemingly of forest or something
growing silvery patches-you might
imagine they were water or light
shining upon something that glis-
tened they were always haphaz-
ard these glimpses we caught
them not always from one direction
-seemingly from everywhere a
realm encompassing-enclosing-our
whole star-filled space

  with the labor of years which
you frank will appreciate to some
degree father has charted what for
our own little ken we might call abso-
lute points in space landmarks
say of this outer realm with our
whirling earth the ever-changing
planets and stars only this outer
realm seemed of fixed position we
could sometimes return our gaze to
the same landmark-a tremendous
crescent-shaped patch of silver for
instance which several times we suc-
ceeded in re-finding

  it was near this patch at which
i was one night gazing when
through some vagary of the ray bear-
ing its image-or some difference in
our crude apparatus-the scene sud-
denly clarified and magnified as
though at once i had leaped a mil-
lion light-years toward it

  i saw then a magnified section of
the larger scene the patch of silver
appeared now as a shimmering
opalescent liquid a segment of
shore-front and this all in a moment
again magnified upon a bluish bank
of soft vegetation with the opal
liquid beside it i saw a girl half re-
clining a girl of human form but


weird tales

transfigured by a beauty more than
human a girl of a civilization be-
hind our own-or perhaps one in ad-
vance-i do not knpw she was
robed in a short simple garment
more like a glistening glowing silver
veil than a dress her hair was long
-a tangled dark mass she reclined
there in an attitude of ease and the
abandonment of maidenly solitude
i say that she was more than beauti-
ful-oh frank-

  bretts voice had suddenly lost the
precise exactitude of the scientist
he seemed to have forgotten his
father-martt and frannie it was
as though he were confiding his
human emotions only to me

  beautiful frank a strange
wild beauty with a curious ethereal
aspect to it i dont know-its in-
describable human-half human
but half divine

he checked himself the scientist
in him again became upper-
most but though he now spoke with
careful phrasing his face remained
flushed

  it was some moments before i
saw additional details and then i
realized that the girl was not alone
upon her bare feet were a sort of
sandal with thongs crossing the
ankle and standing there beside
one of her feet were two tiny human
figures in height the length per-
haps of her little foot men of human
form yet queerly grotesque mis-
shapen one of them was in the act
of reaching upward toward the tassel
of her sandal cord where it dangled
from her ankle reaching as though
to grasp it and draw himself up-
ward the other was watching and
both were grinning with gnomelike
malevolence

  nor was this all for behind the
girl a brief distance away in what
appeared a woodland dell was an-
other figure-a man of aspect akin to

the grinning gnomes save that in
comparative size even to the girl he
was gigantic ten times her height
perhaps he stood behind her tower-
ing into the trees about him a man
of short squat legs dark with matted
hair a garment like the gnomes
which might have been an animal
skin a heavy massive chest black
hair long to his neek a face with
clipped hair upon it he was re-
garding the girl a grin but with a
leer to it-horribly sinister and in
his great hands brandished like a
bludgeon was an uprooted tree

  have i given you an idea of mo-
tion in the scene there was none
the girl was obviously wholly un-
aware that she was not alone she
lay motionless but the lack of move-
ment in her-in them all-was more
marked than that the girls lips
were parted in a half-smile of rev-
ery but the outlines of her bosom
beneath the silver veil did not move
there was no movement of breath
no change of expression the
gnomes the giant-not the minutest
change could i see mirrored in their
faces

  yet it was so lifelike i could not
doubt it was life-and that the mo-
tion was there though i could not see
it i watched all night shaken with
this fragment of drama perhaps
tragedy which i was witnessing-but
even the girls eyelids did not
tremble dawn came the scene
faded

  for a month i did not even tell
father and frank the vision of
that girl has never left me the
menace - gruesome sinister - upon
her-and her beauty-

 havent you ever seen her
again i asked eagerly was it
life how could it be life without
motion

  oh he saw her again martt ex-
claimed ive seen her-weve all
seen her  
explorers into infinity



  tell him brett frannie urged

  a month before i even told
father during it i searched for
the scene unavailing then father
and i searched together it was a
year when almost from the same
orbital position we came upon the
scene again a year-and now we
saw a change the figures all were
there frozen into immobility as be-
fore but the gnome had caught the
tassel had drawn himself partly up
to stand upon the girls white ankle
the giant had come a trifle forward
and the upraised tree in his hands
was partly lowered the girls atti-
tude was unchanged but there was
now upon her face the vague dawn
of startled knowledge as though at
that instant she was becoming aware
of something pulling at her sandal
cord something touching her ankle-
perhaps too she was hearing a sound
from the giant behind her the
startled knowledge which as yet had
not had time fully to register upon
her face

  my mind was whirling with a con-
fusion of thoughts the vague com-
prehension of what brett meant was
coming to me i stammered not
yet had time-but brett you must
have watched them all that night

  that night frank and others
-but there was no sign of movement
another year-that was last year-
we saw the girl partly aware of her
danger this year-a month ago-
she was fully aware of it fright-
ened-her eyes stricken wide with
terror but she had had no time as
yet to move

  dont you understand frank
that drama is going on out there
now like size of matter and space
-and rate of motion-there is no
absolute time it is all comparative
to that realm out there of which we
have been given a little vision our

tiny worlds here in the heavens are
mere whirling electrons like the elec-
trons within one of our own atoms
which to our consciousness of time
revolve many times a second

  a year a single revolution of
our earth about its sun to that girl
out there what we call a year is
merely an electron in a fraction of a
second revolving about its fellow
even that is very slow-for she her-
self is wholly within the atom of a
greater world outside her a year as
we call it-a second or less to her
and though she is in full movement
how can we hope to see it by watch-
ing for a night if a year were a
second to her-an eight-hour vigil of
ours would encompass less than a
thousandth part of a second of her
life

  all comparative frank there
is nothing wonderful or really
strange about it in what we would
experience to be a hundred years
from now that girl will be fully
faced with the menace of her assail-
ants a moment only to her con-
sciousness it is that frank we
meant by the infinity of time  

  tell him what were going to
do martt insisted breathlessly

  it came from brett in a burst al-
most incoherent i was not satis-
fied merely to see into this compara-
tive infinity nor was father we
have worked three feverish years
frank to climax all the labor of
fathers which had gone before
and we have found a way-not mere-
ly to see but to transport ourselves
into these greater realms a vehicle
-ill show you-explain it all its
size can be changed-the state of the
matter imposing it is within our
control its position in space can be
changed-simple enough frank to
enlarge upon the principles of our
interplanetary vehicles and-with
one factor so interdependent upon


weird tales

the other-we have been able to con-
trol the rate of its time-progress it
travels through time as it does
through space

  his words were tumbling over each
other youll see it in a moment
frank-test it-we have it here
ready yesterday it sets us free
dont you understand free at last
in space and time and im going
in it tonight-with martt perhaps-
were going out to reach that girl
upon an equality of size and time-
progress going out to explore
infinity

chafter 

this could destroy the
universe

i had anticipated that they would
show me a vehicle similar perhaps
to the huge and elaborate space-fly-
ers in the service of our interplanet-
ary postal division but instead of
taking me to the workshops where i
had conceived it to be lying-serene
glistening with newness intricate
with what devices for its changing of
size and time-rate i could not imag-
ine-instead of this they took me in-
to the house and there in dr
gryces quiet study with its sober
luxurious furnishings and his library
of cylinders ranged in orderly array
about the walls i saw not one but
four machines-mere models stand-
ing there on the polished table-top
four of them identical-all of a
milk-white metal

  but they were models complete in
every detail i stood beside one re-
garding it with a breathless absorbed
interest as dr gryce commented
upon it a cube of about the length
of my forearm in its three equal
dimensions with a cone-shaped tower
on top-a little tower not much long-
er than my longest finger the cube

itself had a rectangular doorway
and in each face two banks of win-
dows the door slid sidewise the
windows were of a transparent mate-
rial like glass midway about the
cube ran a tiny balcony at the sec-
ond-story level it was wholly en-
closed by the glasslike material it
extended around all four sides small
doors from it gave access to the
cubes interior the cone on top
also had windows and its entire apex
was transparent

  i	bent down and peered into the
lower doorway tiny rooms were
there bedrooms a cookery-a house
complete save that it was wholly un-
furnished the largest room on the
lower story-its floor had a circular
transparent pane in it-was fitted
with a seemingly intricate array of
tiny mechanisms all of the same
milk-white metal a metallic table
held most of them and i could see
wires fine as cobwebs connecting
them and in a corner of this room
a metallic spiral stairway leading to
the upper story

  dr gryce said that is the in-
strument room complete it contains
every mechanism for the operation of
the vehicle we made it in this size
-large enough to facilitate construc-
tion but it is small enough to be eco-
nomical of material this substance
-we have never named it-is of our
own isolation it is expensive ill
explain it presently    that room
beside the instrument room is where
we will put the usual everyday in-
struments necessary to the journey
oxygen tanks-the apparatus for air
purification and air renewal tele-
scopes microscopes-my myrdoscope
-all that sort of thing we can best
obtain in its normal size those-
and the furnishings-the provisions
-all those in their normal size we
will put into it later
explorers into infinity



  you mean i asked this is not
a model this is the actual vehicle
yes he smiled

  but there are four of them
we made six frank it was ad-
visable and not unduly difficult to
duplicate the parts in the making

the assembling took time-

  brett said father was insistent
that we make every advance test pos-
sible we have already used two of
them we are going to test the others
today  

  now exclaimed frannie do
it now-frank will want to see it
dr gryce lifted one of the ve-
hicles in his hand it seemed light as
alemite he placed it on a taboret
and we sat grouped around it

  i shall send it into time he
said quietly   with its size un-
changed with no motion in space
so that always in relation to us it will
remain right here-i am going to
send it back into other ages of
time he turned to me earnestly
we wanted you here frank be-
cause you are so good a friend to me
and my children but for a selfish
reason as well when brett goes out
into space and time tonight i want
your keen eye to follow him your
ability to record so accurately on the
clocks what you see at any given

instant-

  he was referring to my experience
at the table mountain observatory-
my first work when my training per-
iod was over i had indeed a curi-
ously keen vision for astronomical
observation and a quickness of finger
upon the clock to record what i saw
in transit work i was extremely ac-
curate even now they were asking
the postal division for my services at
table mountain in the forthcoming
transit of venus

  dr gryce was saying your accu-
racy is phenomenal frank-your
figures as you observe what little we

see of this flight will help me-set my
mind at rest that brett is making no
errors he ended with a smile so
you realize we have a selfish motive
in wanting you

  im very glad i responded he
nodded and went back at once to
what he had been saying previously
im going to send this into time
you must understand frank that i
can give you now only the funda-
mental concepts underlying this
apparatus we have so much to do
today-so little time for theory i
need only tell you that it is readily
demonstrable that time is one of the
inherent factors governing the state
of matter this substance we have
discovered-created if you will-
yields readily to a change of state
an electronic charge-a current akin
to but not identical with electricity
-changes the state of this substance
in several ways a rapid duplication
of the fundamental entities within its
electrons-they are as you perhaps
know mere whirlpools of nothingness
-this rapid duplication adds size
the substance-with shape unaltered
-grows larger with such a size-
change there comes a normal corre-
spondingly progressive change of
time-rate we had to go beyond
that however and secure an inde-
pendent time-rate independently
changeable so that the vehicle might
remain quiescent in size and still
change its time in doing that the
state of the matter as our senses per-
ceive it is completely altered as you
know no two bodies can occupy the
same space at the same time which
only means that with the time-dimen-
sions identical different dimensions
of space are needed with the time-
dimension differing-the state of
matter is different two bodies thus
can be together in the same space
what is a time-dimension i
asked i mean-how can you alter
it


weird tales

  i would say frank that the
time-dimcnsion of a material body is
the length-or a measure of the
length-of its fundamental vibra-
tion basically there is no real sub-
stance as we conceive it-for all mat-
ter is mere vibration let us delve
into substance we find matter con-
sists of molecules vibrating in space
molecules are composed of atoms
vibrating in space within the atoms
are electrons revolving in space the
electrons are without substance
merely vibrations electrically nega-
tive in character the nucleus-once
termed proton-is all then that we
have left of substance what is it
a mere vortex-an electrical vortex
of nothingness

  you see frank there is no real
substanee existing it is all vibra-
tion motion in other words of
what that we do not know call
it a motion of disembodied electrical
energy perhaps it is something akin
to that but from it our substantial
tangible material universe is built
all dependent upon its vibratory
rate and the measure of that i
would call the time-dimension
when we alter that-when through
the impulse of a current of vibration
we attack that fundamental vortex to
make it whirl at greater or lesser
rate-then we in effect have
changed the time-dimension

  there was so much that seemed
dimly close to my understanding
and yet eluded me

  but i said if you send that
little cube back into time it will no
longer exist at all it will be in the
past-non-existent now or suppose
you send it into the future it will
exist sometime-but now it will be
non-existent

  ah thats where youre wrong
brett exclaimed dont you realize
that youre making time absolute
youre taking yourself and this pres-

ent instant as fixed points of space
and time-the standards beyond
which nothing else can exist thats
fatuous frank look here its simple
enough once you grasp it time and
space are quite similar except that
you have never moved about in time
but you have in space suppose you
had not suppose-with your pres-
ent power of thought-you were this
house you had always been here-
always would be here suppose too
that the world-the land and water-
moved slowly past you at an unalter-
able rate thats what time does to
us then suppose i were to say to
you-you as the house-let us go
now to great-london that would 
puzzle you you would say great-
london was here a year ago but
now it is gone-non-existent it did
exist-but now it doesnt or you
would say the shore of the great-
pacific ocean will be here next year 
if i said im going there now you
would reply but youll be in the
future youll be non-existent
making yourself the standard of
everything dont you see how fatu-
ous that is

  i did not answer it was so strange
a mode of thought it made me feel
so insignificant so enslaved by the
fetters of my human senses and
these fetters brett was very soon to
cast off

 ii

martt said cant we make the
tests father  there is a fright-
ful lot to do and its nearly mid-
morning already

  from the table dr gryce took a
small rod of the milk-white metal-
a rod half a meter long and the diam-
eter of my smallest finger ije knelt
on the floor beside the taboret peer-
ing into the tiny doorway of the
mechanism he was about to send
winging into the distant ages of our
past again we were breathless
explorers into infinity



  more light frannie he said
i can not see inside here fran-
nie illumined the tubes along the
ceiling the room was flooded with
their soft blue-white light

  thats better rod in hand he
turned momentarily to me im
going to throw the time-switch by
pressing it with this rod he ex-
plained within the vehicle-the
confined space there-the current is
equally felt he smiled gravely
without the rod i should lose a
finger to the past-

  carefully he inserted the rod into
the doorway a moment of fumbling
then i heard a click the little milk-
white model seemed to tremble it
glowed from it there came a soft
infinitely small humming sound it
glowed melted into translucency-
transparency for an instant i had
a vague sense that a spectral wraith
of it was still before me then with
a blink of my eyelids i realized that
it was gone the taboret was empty
beside it dr gryce knelt with the
rod melted off midway of its length
in his hand

  i breathed again brett said soft-
ly it is gone frank gone into
the past relative to our conscious-
ness of time gone from our senses
-yet it is here-occupying the same
space it did before-but with a
different time

  he passed his hand through the
apparent vacancy above the taboret
to me then came a realization of how
crowded all space must be of what
a tiny fraction of things existent-of
events occurring-are we conscious
that space over the taboret-empty
to me    yet it held for a mind
omniscient an infinity of things
strewn through the ages of the past
and future what multiplicity of
events-unseen by me-time was
holding separate in that crowded
space above the taboret

  dr gryce was saying let us test
one now by sending it into smallness
-come here frank

  he had risen to stand by the table
with another of the models before
him this bit of stone he said
let us send it into that

  he laid a flat piece of black-gray
smoothly polished stone on the table
near the model and with another
rod he reached  ito the doorway
again i heard a click he withdrew
the rod you see frank

  i saw that the rod was slightly
compressed along the length he had
inserted the model was already
dwindling soundlessly untremb-
lingly-it was contracting becoming
smaller with shape and aspect other-
wise unchanged soon it was the
size of my fist dr gryce picked it
up rested it upon his opened hand
but in a moment it was no more than
a tiny cube rocking in the movement
of his palm he gripped it gingerly
with thumb and forefinger and set it
on the polished black slab of stone
its milk-white color there showed it
clearly but it was very small-
smaller than the thumb-nail of my
little finger the cone-shaped tower
was a needle-point

  a breathless moment passed it
was now no more than a white speck
upon the black stone surface

  brett said try the microscope
frank you watch it

  i put the low-powered instrument
over it brett adjusted the light
the stone was smoothly polished
but now under the glass upon a
shaggy mass of uneven rock surface

i	saw the vehicle visually as large
as it had been originally but it was
dwindling progressively faster soon
it lay tilted sidewise upon a slope of
the rock smaller-a tiny speck cling-
ing there

  can you still see it brett mur-
mured


weird tales

   yes-no-now it is gone the
 rock seemed empty somewhere down
 in there the little mechanism lay
 dwindling forever it would grow
 smaller dwindling into an infinity
 of smallness but always to be with
 things of its size-and things yet
 smaller   

   as i turned from the glass i be-
  came aware that martt and frannie
 were not in the xoom dr gryce
 and brett absorbed in the test quite
 evidently had not noticed them leave
 there had been two other models on
 the table-there was now but one

   then from the garden outside the
 house a cry reached us a shout-a
 cry of fear-terror martts voice

   father brett help us help
 quick

 ue rushed from the room

     crowning wonder yet horrible
 a surge of fear swept me in the
 garden quite near the house stood the
 other model small no longer it
 had grown-was growing-until al-
 ready it was as large as the house
 itself around it the flowers shrubs
 even a tree had been pushed and
 trampled by its expanding bulk it
 stood gleaming white in the sun-
 light motionless save for that steady
 increasingly rapid growth its win-
 dows and doors loomed large dark
 rectangles its balcony was broad as
 a corridor its cone tower was
 already reared higher than the near-
 est trees

   father help

   at the doorway of the vehicle
 standing just outside it were the
 terror-stricken martt and frannie
 they were holding the end of a long
 metallic pole which projected into
 the doorway struggling with its
 weight striving to throw the switch
 inside

   we reached them the expanding
 hulk of the gleaming side of the ve-

 hicle had pushed them back into a
 thicket of shrubbery near them a
 tree uprooted as though it were a
 straw sticking upright in sand was
 pushed aside and fell with a crash

  martt and frannie were livid with
terror breathless almost exhausted
with their futile efforts

  martt panted we cant-lift the
pole its-too heavy--too large in-
side

  within the huge doorway by the
sunlight streaming through the win-
dows i could see the interior half of
the pole bloated by growth huge
heavy

 brett shoved frannie away
frank here-take hold with us

  dr gryce was with us together
we four men got the interior end of
the pole upon the table inside a
tremendous switch lever was there
but the pole slipped rolled down i
expected it to break at the doorway
point where it was so small outside
butit did not the expanding door-
way had pushed us farther back
another tree on the other side fell
above us the vehicles tower loomed
like a cathedral spire tremendous
now the vehicle had grown until it
was almost touching the house a
fence had been trampled had van-
ished beneath its giant bulk

  and the growth was increasingly
rapid if we could not check it   
if it got wholly beyond control-this
monster growing    forever grow-
ing to a size infinitely large-larger
than our earth itself   

  i must have been standing stupid-
ly confused i heard dr gryce im-
ploring take hold of it frank
we must lift it we must-our last
chance-

  but brett pushed us away im
going inside i can move the switch
-let go of me father that switch

it stood on a steep mountain slope

havent you heard of princess ta-
mara   

 wilton remembered the well-
known caucasian legend about the
princess who would lure travelers to
her castle and after a night of pas-
sion throw the discarded victims of
her fleeting favor into the river
swirling below

  i meant who lives there now
he asked the guide being sure that
he had mixed his tenses

 tamara lives there was the
amazing answer

  she lives there now

 now

  wilton smiled tolerantly those
people were like children in their
weird beliefs brought up in the sober
atmosphere of the new world he

                                    


weird tales

considered himself immune from sucli
nonsense but as he glanced once
more at the castle abbve the smile
faded from his ironical lips for up
there in the tall narrow windows
lights flashed up one after another
like large yellow stars rivaling the
pale stars above those slim towers

  you mean the castle is occupied
by her descendants he said per-
suasively and it was partly himself
whom he tried to satisfy that the
guide was talking nonsense

  no she herself princess tama-
ra was the obstinate answer

  but she lived centuries ago
  but she lives again

  they descended the mountain path
in silence there was no use argu-
ing with that superstitious boy the
lights of the village lying in the
misty valley glittered faintly like
phosphorescent fires over an un-
plumbed swamp

  the swish of the torrent left be-
hind them was like an unintelligible
whisper trying to convey a mystery

  the silence grew oppressive to
break its unnerving spell wilton
asked his guide sing for me ibra-
him let us rest for a while on this
rock so you can take your guitar
off your shoulder

 i may sing while walking i
would not stay so near tamaras
place

  as he was unstrapping from his
shoulder his preeious italian instru-
ment wilton asked by the way
where did you learn your english
in new york i had a rug shop
there

  the business was not good you
had to return

  not that i no like new world
everything too clear  

  just what do you mean

  but the boy did not answer he
pluckcd the strings of his guitar and

sang the popular ballad about ta-
mara

from that turret so high and so narrow
   fair tamara was casting her spell

she was fairer than angels of heaven
   she was eruel as demons of hell

  on trailed the ballad sung in a
low indolent voice wilton did not
understand half of the words but
their meaning was familiar in the
pale light of the rising moon he pic-
tured to himself the unfortunate vic-
tims of her love how they were hur-
ried to the cataract below how the
stormy waves mourned their death
   the song went on

her good-bye was so sweet and so tender
   so caressing her musical voice

you would think it was promising pas-
     sion   

  wilton thought with dismay of
how those orientals delighted in de-
scriptions of tragic love while his
guide sang about the deathly pale-
ness of the lovers lips the rocks
tearing his body and the waves kiss-
ing his dead cheeks he seemed to
enjoy the gloomy ballad his deep
dark eyes were flre-pools of sensuous
dreams his indolent face looked
tender and more beautiful than ever
wilton recalled the stories of the
wealthy russian ladies robbed and
violated by those tender-faced tar-
tar guides  he wondered how such
a delicate effeminate beauty could
be so savage

the moon rose higher surrounded
by a great opal ring suddenly
a wind from the east dispersed the
fog billowing around the castle and
it could be clearly seen proudly
perched  the cliff above the water-
fall its towers were now ominously
dark and the lights flickering in its
windows were like winking eyes of
the malicious mountain djinns

  lets return to the hotel the
american ordered abruptly
the castle of tamara



  but it became suddenly impossi-
ble the clouds gathered and there
followed one of those unexpected
unaccountable showers so frequent
in the mountains

  it stopped almost as soon as it
started but the air saturated with
dampness became even more misty
the moon was blotted out they could
only guess its presence by the milky
color of the fog pierced now and
then by a shaft of liquid silver it
was as if the moonlight became solid-
ified forming a wall of mystery be-
tween them and the village below

  the guide refused to move he
sat on a stone boulder and declared
he was going to stay there until the
mists cleared the impatient amer-
ican produced an electric torch and
a compass

  this will keep us from being
lost he explained to the guide

  but the boy refused to trust it
i will not move he said some-
thing may turn the magnet the
wrong way 

    quit these infernal superstitions
you are plain lazy are you afraid
that your witch from the cas-
tle-

  please barin he pleaded she
may hear you

  you are a coward

  but even the insult failed to move
ibrahim he bent toward his com-
panions ear and whispered some-
thing which made the american
stare incredulously

  was the boy lying there was no
reason for it yet the thing seemed
utterly impossible here in this com-
paratively civilized part of the cau-
casus a woman had thrown a man
over the precipice and was not even
tried for it

  why didnt they arrest her
you can not arrest a witch the
boy said with deep conviction

  have you heard of others being
killed

  no-she is old now she doesnt
care for lovers i believe

  wilton fell silent his eyes trying
to pierce the seething mists strange
to say after the story which he had
just heard he wanted to go there to
meet that woman he had never had
a real adventure in his life never a
wild night not even while in college
his mother had had a weak heart
and the boy was brought up with
awed consideration for her illness
it was always you must not do
this and you must not do that
because it might kill mother and
this was stronger than fear of pun-
ishment when he greav up he still
remained a model boy always sup-
pressing his adventurous nature un-
til she died leaving him a small leg-
acy which enabled him to take the
long-desired trip around the world

  he went to russia just because
people had warned him that he
shoiild not the possibility of dan-
gerous romantic happenings attract-
ed him but he had met with no real
danger as yet save the legal hold-
ups of the hotelkeepers and guides
who proved to be the same the world
over

  but here at last was a sense of
mystery it was absurd to believe
in the reincarnation of the cruel
princess who probably had never ex-
isted save in a legend yet he longed
to believe in it for like most of us
he longed for something unusual to
happen something which he did not
have to plan ahead now that un-
usual thing seemed to lurk up there
in the castle of tamara yet it was
absurd to invite disaster

  forcibly he sobered himself and
declared well we cant stay here
all night since you refuse to go i
will return to the village alone

  oh barin dont do that

  but wilton would not listen to the
whining boy by now he had lost
patience with his cowardly supersti-
tions the village was but a short


weird tales

distance away and he did not believe
in witches turning the needle of the
compass

he walked away it seemed to
him in the right direction yet
half an hour passed and he did not
reach the village the road before
him became steep again rising up in
curves-and he had expected to
reach the valley by now clammy
fear assaulted him as he looked at
his compass the needle was turn-
ing restlessly like a weathercock

 i must be near some magnetic
ore he assured himself aloud if
it were so it was bad but natural
wilton dont be a superstitious
idiot he upbraided himself when
the other thought obtruded

  the wind blew in his direction
chasing down the mists and bringing
to his ears the ever-increasing swish-
ing of the mountain torrent it un-
veiled the foamy waves and above
them wilton saw the walls of the
castle

  the view of that dark structure
glinting in the faint moonlight was
so unexpected and so somber that it
filled him with awe the castle seen
closely lost its airy grace it loomed
solid massive forbidding its gates
crisscrossed with huge iron bars
the narrow mountain road leading
to it seemed too steep for either
horse or carriage

 how do people communicate
with the valley below came the in-
voluntary thought and in har-
mony with liis superstitious mood
there flashed across his mind a pic-
ture from a folk-story-a witch fly-
ing home on a broom there seemed
no other way to approach the castle
except on foot or with wings

  yet the road proved broader than
it looked in the deceitful moonlight
presently there appeared a rider in
a rain-soaked black burka and high
white papaha its glistening wet fur
hanging over the riders face the

foam-flecked horse climbed heavily
up the steep slope

  as if at a given signal the massive
gates swung open and the stranger
rode in moved by irresistible curi-
osity wilton ran toward the slowly
closing gates and reached them just
in time to push his alpine stick into
the narrow slit which still remained
between them

  a voice from within called hoarse-
ly who is it

  a stranger i lost my way

 this was enough wilton knew
that the unwritten law of caucasian
hospitality entitled any stranger who
had lost his way to be admitted into
any home in the mountains the
gates swung wide again moaning on
their hinges like a beast in torment
and the traveler found himself in the
vast courtyard paved with black and
white slabs of marble

  he looked around with curiosity
the strange rider who had preceded
him had disappeared as if removed
from the scene by a stroke of a
magic wand he caught only a
glimpse of the servant leading away
the foaming horse

  another servant a broad-shoul-
dered georgian with a wasplike
waist approached him and politely
invited him to enter the sakla and
accept shelter and food wilton
followed him into a large hall light-
ed only by the logs burning in a
cavernous fireplace as soon as he
seated himself comfortably on a
bearskin-covered bench there en-
tered a stout lady in black with a
veil hanging from her traditional
georgian headgear resembling a nar-
row crown the veil was thrown off
her face and covered her graying
hair

  she looked at him benignly with
her languorous black eyes the only
remains of her faded beauty and
asked may i know your name
most welcome stranger
the castle of tamara



 after wilton answered adding
that he was lost during his descent
into the valley she nodded her head
indifferently as if there was nothing
unexpected in a mans being lost
within sight of his destination

  the fogs and the magic stones
she explained her voice was unusu-
ally musical for an old woman

 wilton interpreted the magic
stones as the magnetic ore the ex-
istence of which he had blamed for
the queer behavior of his compass
after all there was nothing mysteri-
ous in the ladys manner she must
have sheltered many a strayed trav-
eler before then why should she be
surprized he argued with himself
but unreasonable insidious thoughts
crawled into his reasoning what if
the meeting was-arranged 

  wilton dont be a superstitious
idiot he upbraided himself again

  his hostess clapped her hands
two boys entered noiselessly like ap-
paritions wilton knew it was their
felt boots which made them glide so
noiselessly yet there was something
uncanny about their catlike steps

 an order was delivered in a
strange tongue and almost instant-
ly after the boys disappeared his
nostrils caught the appetizing smell
of a broiled shdhlyk it seemed as if
his appearance was the signal for
supper as if the hostess waited ex-
pressly for him

  she made him a sign to resume his
seat which he had left at her en-
trance and slumped heavily on the
bench opposite instantly the watch-
ful servant pushed a little footstool
under her feet which was scarcely
visible under the heavy silk skirt
her hands went to her bosom and
she took from it a mohammedan
rosary made of amber with a shin-
ing golden bead on its tassel end
and started fingering it absently

 and now tell me where do you
come from and who are your par-
ents

  it was just a formal question of
politeness for she listened with a de-
tached air as he was answering her
briefly he could not help asking him-
self was she bored by his explana-
tion or had she known it all in ad-
vance 

  catching himself thinking weird
thoughts again wilton concluded
that the caucasus went to his
head

  the servants brought in the tasty
shahlyk broiled on silver skillets
and offered it to him and his hostess
on the same large plate they also
brought native bread long soft flat
which one could roll like a piece of
heavy fabric his hostess ate it
tearing little pieces from the whole
roll

  he looked at her pudgy fingers
with beautiful fingernails and won-
dered against his will if this was the
reincarnation of the woman to whom
the legend ascribed the love mur-
ders if so her second life was near-
ing its decline this overripe bosom
this craped face he thought could
not lure men any longer he wanted
to laugh at his guides notion that
this benign elderly woman in chaste
black dress was a dangerous en-
chantress

his hunger appeased his thoughts
clarified he bid his hostess a
thankful good-night and briskly fol-
lowed a servant whom she sent to
show him his room situated up the
narrow stairs in an octagonal tower
after the servant left the self-invit-
ed guest began to undress rapidly
feeling too tired even to observe his
surroundings

  he took off one of his muddy
shoes and stiffened holding it in his
hand his attention arrested by low
melodious singing he heard the
gentle strumming of a zurna accom-
pany the unintelligible foreign
words he could not understand


weird tales

them but it was unmistakably a
song of love

  its languor its insidious sweet-
ness the longing it awakened re-
minded him of the less tender but
equally passionate air sung by his
guide

 so this was how the witch at-
tracted her victims his critical
mind surrendered the night the
strange surroundings the weariness
of his journey all conspired to make
him succumb to the waves of super-
stition which haunt the air of cau-
casus he listened listened hungri-
ly longing to see the singer could
it really be his hostess singing
could an old woman possess such a
voice 

  he again drew on his muddy shoe
and laced it absent-mindedly still
listening to the languorous song as
it died out a window was opened
one flight below-he heard its shut-
ters strike the stone wall some-
thing like a beating of heavy bats
wings flapped against the window
glass then he heard musical laugh-
ter young yet somehow sadly
forced the window-frame shook
the glass trembled   his curiosity
aroused beyond endurance wilton
ran to the window and looked out

  below in the uncertain light of
the mist-veiled moon he saw a black
form dangling from the window
ledge he shrank back terrified in
a flash he recalled the stranger who
had ridden into the castle just be-
fore him sudden conclusion made
his heart contract with horror and
pity that stranger was being
thrown out of the tower window
just as the ballad had it

  then why did he not cry-for help
was he too proud or too desperate

  wilton did not consider for long
his natural chivalry aroused he was
bending out of the window before
he knew it shouting hold out fel-
low help is coming

  he snatched a sheet from his bed
tore it in two tying the parts in a
secure marine knot fastened one end
to the hook of the shutter and easily
swung down the improvised line
trying to reach the black form now
plastered helplessly against the wall

  as he steadied himself enough to
grasp the hanging form the swiftly
passing clouds unveiled the moon
and in its full light wilton saw a wet
burka hung out to dry

  he felt that he had made himself
utterly ridiculous with his attempts
to save that comical cloak dripping
with rain he wanted to retreat as
soon as possible but could not climb
back he had seen it done so neatly
in the movies but in real life it
required unusual strength he felt
that if he did not reach the window
below he would have to let go and

then- he heard the mountain

river swishing below his feet the
wind swayed his body rapidly and
made him dizzy

  he cotild lift himself only to the
level of the window fortunately
it was open in the faint light of
an image lamp burning in the dis-
tant comer he saw a womans figure
with a zurna on her lap

  he was ashamed to disturb her
yet he had to do so as his strength
was ebbing fast he made the last
desperate effort and succeeded in
climbing a little higher up his line
his feet were now touching the win-
low ledge he stepped on it with a
sigh of relief instantly he heard a
piercing shriek

 jumping in he approached the
screaming figure writh rambling
words of explanation luminous
black eyes widened with horror
stared at him from the ghastly pale
face

  it was not the face of his hostess
to be sure there was a resemblance
the eyes were the same but her
features although distorted with
horror were beautiful and the fig-
the castle of tamara



nre shrinking away from him was
slim like a young palm as she
sprang to her feet her tightly plait-
ed black hair tumbled down her back
like a great glistening snake

  i beg your pardon he repeated
again and again i did not mean to
intrude  

 his soothing voice calmed her
somewhat and she consented to list-
en to his explanations huddled back
into her rattan chair pressing her
zurna to her breast as if it were a
weapon of defense her slim brown
hands trembled and the instrument
gave a plaintive sound as she nerv-
ously jerked at its strings

 but how could you take my
burka for a man why should a
man hang out of the window she
asked at last still suspicious

  he gave no answer how could he
tell her the truth  his wild thoughts
about a man being hurled out of the
window by a witch seemed to him
now utterly incredible he could not
bring himself to confess them

  she looked at him long and search-
ingly then a somber smile stirred
her face that smile made her look
suddenly older only now he no-
ticed a gray lock among the heavy
black waves of her hair

  so yon too have heard about
that  

  still he stood silent his head bent
low ashamed to look into her face
it was a sweetly sad face kindly and
trustful now that she had accepted
his explanation how could anyone
suspect such an innocent-looking
frightened little woman of premedi-
tated murder

  i would not be surprized if a
caucasian believed the silly story
but you an american

  how do you know i am an amer-
ican

  my aunt told me do sit down
now that you are here she pushed
toward him a little padded footstool

 she would think me compro-

mised if she saw you here but i
dont mind it is ages since i saw
a new face the solitude here
drives me mad its several years

since-

  she stopped abruptly her beauti-
ful eyes widened again as if she saw
a ghost

  she came to live avith me since
my father died she doesnt care for
the mountaineers superstitions and
is surprized at nothing she seems
to take everything for granted this
is because she is so very primitive
when i was young i thought it was
because she is so very wise

 but you are young he pro-
tested

  i am twenty-six an old age for
a georgian woman i gave up mar-
riage none would marry a witch
again she smiled bewitchingly
they think me a reincarnation
of princess tamara they say i can
grow old and young at will she
laughed forcedly ridiculous isnt
it unfortunately my name is also
tamara

  she fell silent her smooth fore-
head crossed by a frown

  now that they think the worst
of me she continued in a plaintive
musical voice i dont care what i
do i prance on horseback until late
into the night alone in mens
clothes i saw you entering the cas-
tle after me

  riding up that steep slippery
road you might have killed your-
self

  as he said this he looked at her
small hands at the delicate oval of
her face into her eyes of a timid doe
and wondered how such a woman
could prance on horseback

  you might have killed yourself
he repeated and felt a painful con-
traction of the heart at the very
thought of it that strange woman
with her childlike face and wisp of
gray hair over her left temple was


weird tales

rapidly arousing in him unusual ten-
derness

  i could not nothing could hap-
pen to a witch 

  please stop reproaching me for
my stupid notions and tell me how
it happened that people began to be-
lieve it some strange misunder-
standing no doubt a guide in the

village told me-

  he stopped abruptly it would be
cruel to repeat to her ibrahims
story

  he told you that i killed a man
she supplemented quite right
her face took on hard grimness
her gentleness was gone

  he was a giiide who taught me
to ride on horseback he was very
drunk that day he insulted me i
had to fight for my honor he fol-
lowed me to the flat tower roof   
my father and his servants were on
a big hunt and i hated to cry for
help to my women i pushed him
away from me he reeled and
plunged into the river before he
died he told the priest who minis-
tered to his departing soul-what
you have heard such a vengeance 
they were both silent the sky
outside darkened as if saddened by
the tragic story the moon disap-
peared the rain began pouring again

  ah it is good to tell it to an out-
sider to one who is not obsessed
with those insane beliefs this is
asia old asia i am living in as
stuffy with legends as it was thou-
sands of years ago it was cruel of
my father to educate me abroad and
then to seclude me in this hole
her eyes blazed with indignation
without realizing it wilton laid his
hand on her shoulder to calm her
his sympathy and tenderness be-
came tinted with a warmer feeling

  they made my life miserable
children hoot after me when i come
to the village my father-he was a
very influential man here-had
hushed the affair and i was not even

brought to trial partly because the
man was a tartar guide and they
are hated here maybe it would be
better if i were tried as it is   
that bloody veil of mystery about
me it suffocates me

  her voice broke she was sobbing
now sobbing pitifully like an abused
child imperceptibly her head rested
on his shoulder it was warm and
scented with the roses of shiraz her
soft body not bound by any corset
swayed gently against his strug-
gling through the sympathetic pity
there arose in him intense desires  
he wanted to silence those sobs with
kisses

  it is wonderful he whispered
hotly wonderful that i found
you  

  all his life he had had dreams
which he deemed foolish dreams
about finding his love in some dis-
tant land rescuing her from distress
as is told in romantic books and
now that the meeting was realized
it seemed a vision

  you such a gentle flower in
these jungles i will take you away
from here they do not believe in
witches in my country

  oh do you mean it do take me
away

 would you go would you

trust me

 go with you why yes you
are the most wonderful thing that
ever happened to me would i trust
you let me look at your face
you-you look like saint george the
dragon-killer the patron saint of
georgia

  she looked into his large deep-set
blue eyes stroking indolently his
high forehead with light wet curls
plastered to it she lightly touched
with her finger his broad generous
mouth she admired every feature
of that face so spiritual in compari-
son with the full-lipped swarthy
men of her race
the castle of tamara



  you look like saint george she
repeated

  suddenly the door-knob shook
and they heard the muffled sounds
of retreating steps tamara looked
around dazedly like one awakened
from a dream

  why did i tell you all this
why it was shameless of me
shameless please go away i am
afraid servants were spying 

  gently she shook his hand from
her shoulder

  i am a lost one anyhow she
whispered i shouldnt care but
my aunt   she would be furious if
she saw a man in my room  

  reluctantly he turned to the door
she stopped him

  oh no i just heard steps there
they may be watching still cant
you go through the window
dubiously he looked out the rain
still lashed the castle walls the gusts
of wind were shaking the shutters
it would be a heroic stunt to go out
this way well was he not wishing
for an adventure a dangerous ad-
venture  here it was mocking him

  knowing that he was about to do
a foolish a neck-breaking thing he
braced himself to refuse yet one
look into those languid eyes those
appealing lips breathing sweeter
than the roses of shiraz and his
mind was made up an instinct
stronger than that of self-preserva-
tion prompted him to smile as-
suredly

  certainly i will go through the
window-if you kiss me

  there was a commotion at the
door the girl turned her flushed
face toward him her lips were
parted expectantly

he kissed her so long and so hard
that her lips bled yet she
smiled beatifieally through her tear-
stained eyes repeating caressingly
words in a foreign tongue the words

which he felt were endearments
absurdly he remembered lines from
the ballad

her words were so sweet and so tender
  so caressing her musical voice

you would think it wras promising pas-
     sion  

  the remembrance was ominous
but he chased it away

  the door shook on its hinges as if
forced by a hurricane

  the woman rose to her feet her
body rigid her face grave she ap-
peared taller and older

  she will kill me if she finds you
here such a disgrace oh good-
bye beloved

  she pushed him toward the win-
dow as he was feeling for the rope
line clammy with dampness and
grasped it he heard the door open
swiftly he jumped out and hung
swayed by the wind

  he tried to climb upward but
could not the wind was too strong
and his muscles strangely tired as if
the long moments of passion had ex-
hausted their strength he remained
there lashed by the rain listening
with sinking heart to the stormy
torrent below asking himself how
long he could endure it

  tamara stood at the window
watching him whispering if you
cant climb up jump down

  at first he thought that his ears
deceived him to jump down into
that torrent which he could hear
roaring below the woman who had
just called him beloved was or-
dering him to leap to certain death

  again he heard her saying this
time louder jump down

  her face peered at him from the
surrounding gloom unearthlily beau-
tiful a wistful sweet face looking
like a mystic msion which blossomed
out of the fog the light behind her
made her raven hair shine like a


weird tales

dark halo he recalled the words
from the ballad

she was fairer than angels of heaven

  she was cruel as demons of hell

  in that moment he believed every-
thing that ibrahim had told him
the woman was a witch he be-
lieved it fully desperately as he saw
her closing the window deliberately
locking him out

  his hands tightened on the rope
line he decided to wait until the in-
truders left her room then break
the window and force his way back

  he peered within trying to blink
off the drops of rain clinging to his
eyelashes but he could see only a
blur of strong light and dim figures
moving through it it was like a
moving picture film out of focus he
heard the angry voice of his hostess
booming on and on when she came
nearer the window he caught the
words

  i dont believe you you must
have invited him into your room no
one heard you crying for help you
are as bad as they say i wouldnt
be surprized if you were really a
witch i am leaving you heaivme
live here alone you do not need a
decent woman to protect you any
longer you hussy

 with that she left the room
stamping heavily her women serv-
ants following her

  as soon as the door closed behind
her tamara opened the window
when wilton scrambled in she said
appealingly my aunt is enraged
she wants to leave me here alone
will you go to her my beloved and
ask my hand in marriage

  he was speechless with amazement
and rage to ask such a thing of
him after she had wanted him to be
killed he had an impulse to swear
to strike her

restraining himself he said with-
eringly you dont imagine i am

going to marry you after you
wanted to kill me

  she flew toward him with a falter-
ing cry to kill you my clear-eyed
falcon how can you say such a
thing

 the hypocrisy of the woman
seemed to him appalling he had to
go away or he would strike her his
hand on the door-knob he turned
his head scornfully didnt you
ask me to jump down he accused
her

 yes i did but-

 he opened the door and the
squeaking of its hinges drowned the
rest of her sentence her voice un-
til now pitifully low grew desper-
ately loud

 listen dont go i will ex-
plain

  i will not listen to any explana-
tions you are a liar if you are
not a witch then you are a heartless
cruel woman

  he was already on the other side
of the door he was shaken with
rage when thinking that a short
while ago he believed in her explana-
tions of the murder that bewitch-
ing voice held no more appeal for
him

  i loathe you he cried slam-
ming the door after him

  he heard her muffled cry you
dont believe me you hate me
then look

  against his will he was moved to
open the door bewildered he saw
her jumping out of the window

 dazedly he approached it and
bent over the void filled with crawl-
ing fog the rain had ceased the
moon had set the mists below grew
milky white lighted by the promise
of dawn for a while nothing was
heard from below save the steady
swish-swash of the torrent then
tamaras voice more appealing than
ever sounded through the fog

  leap-leap down beloved
the castle of tamara



  his head went dizzy after the
sleepless night those swift changes
from horror to love from love to
rage his brain was fagged the
melodious voice sounding through
the milky mists once more swayed
his heart there could be no danger
in that call he felt irresistibly
drawn toward it down down to
join her she could not have called
from the bottom of the torrent she
called to love and safety

  only when his feet were already
slipping off the window ledge he re-
called with frenzy of new suspicions
the tales about the sirens who lured
the sailors to their doom down into
the waves to be dashed against the
rocks

 once again he heard her call
then his head struck against some-
thing hard and he lost conscious-
ness

when he opened his eyes his
head was lying on her lap his
temples bathed with some fragrant
lotion the sun shone over the dis-
persing mists and the air was filled
with vanishing rainbows he looked
dazedly around and saw they were
in a small garden only a few paces
away from the roaring torrent but
separated from it by a high fence of
grilled iron little rock-flowers the
color of dawn trailed down beyond
the bars like wistful prisoners long-
ing for their freedom

  he looked up and the happenings
of last night became suddenly clear
to him for the window from which
he had jumped was but a few feet
from the ground

 shamefacedly he met the great
luminous eyes of the witch her

face wan pale and suffering bent
over his

  i was so afraid she said you
wouldnt open your eyes for so
long   you had struck your head
against the edges of the fountain
only now he saw the little round
fountain playing among the water-
lilies its marble basin was broken
by the storm and the water trickled
out of it running along the narrow
flagstone path to join the waves rag-
ing belqw that secluded flower-
scented spot

 but-hadnt he-hadnt that
man leapt from there to his death
why not from this tower do
you think i could bear living here
afterward  that wing is on the very
brink of the toitent the entrance
has been nailed up no one has en-
tered it since the accident servants
say demons live there

  at any other time he would have
laughed at their superstitions now
after he had been a victim of equally
fantastic beliefs he did not feel like
scorning anyones wild notions in-
stead he asked gently

 will you forgive me and go
away from here with me away from
witches and demons

  she laughed tenderly

  there are no devils here only
the bad will of the people but i
would go with you even to the top
of the witch mountain

  he looked admiringly at her clear
young face uplifted toward the sun
sailing above the morning mists and
the heavy darkness rolled off his
mind as if the sunshine reached its
depths chasing away the mists of
superstition

as bonita pivoted toward us
something yellow and shiny
slithered down from above on her
shoulder

it was my usual mid-weekly
visit to dr wilkies laboratory
for some reason a large and
heavily barred animal cage had ar-
rested my attention its sole in-
habitant was a small guinea-pig

  whats the idea of this big cage
for a dinky guinea-pig i demand-
ed promptly   going to make a lion
out of him

  dr wilkie grinned perhaps
he said as a matter of fact the
ordinary cages are not strong enough
to hold andy thats what i call
this chap just watch

  he took an empty basket cage the
square kind with half-inch meshes of
chicken-wire and open at the top and
dropped it into the barred cage cov-
ering the guinea-pig now watch
andy

  anyone who has ever watched
guinea-pigs in a laboratory will have
noticed the patience of these animals
which makes them sueh ideal sub-
jects for experiments they are pas-

sive and never show signs of fight
this andy chap however was dif-
ferent decidedly so as soon as the
basket cage fell over him he reared
up and began to claw the chicken-
wire to my amazement the wires
bent and snapped like so many feeble
threads in scarcely ten seconds a
rent was made sufficiently large to
permit andy to pass through

  but andy was not content with
the opening he turned to another
spot and ripped and tore then to
still another point to repeat the per-
formance he tore and twisted with
a quiet ferocity that was completely
startling in a guinea-pig in a short
minute the basket cage was reduced
to a mass of accordioned shreds

  after that lie ran to the bars and
began to nuzzle them

  good lord i exclaimed draw-
ing back a bit hes-doctor is he
bending those bars  or is my
imagination making me think they
are bending

                                   


weird tales

 dr wilkie waved a competent
hand and remarked i guess theyll
hold andy all right but lets go in-
to the library and smoke while i tell
you a story only-he made an
ironical grimace-  only remember
this andy isnt a he at all this he
is a she andy is a female guinea-
pig not a male at least andy start-
ed out that way but now-

  this is the story dr wilkie told me
that night



 ll this happened rather more
- than twenty years ago we were
a party of seven going up the parana
on an old stem-wheeler the property
of don ramon one of the seven we
were on our way to the gran chaco

to get- but why bother about

that part we never got there and
thats the story

  it wasnt a lucky trip engine
trouble snags leaks and what-not
and finally a terrific pampero that
drove us up on an island in mid-
stream and partly wrecked our stern
wheel it also wrecked our only boat
and marooned us on the ship since to
get to the shore we would have to
wade through shallows populated
with greedy jacares and alligators

  fortunately some huge floats came
down the parana within a few hours
and the rafters stopped to help us
make repairs

  and it was then that we first heard
of the strong one or the strong
demon as it was called we told
the rafters that we were making for
the gran chaco and that we intended
to leave the ship near villeta and
pole up the brazo occidental into the
chaco

 santo cristo exclaimed one
of the rafters stay away from
there senores there is something
fearful there

  something fearful don ramon
inquired what do you mean

  we know not serior the rafter
replied but there must be some-
some demon there there at the
mouth of the brazo occidental is the
peninsula del circulo where ships
and rafts stop for the night they
prefer that to the harbor of san
lorenzo a mile farther down but
now they are afraid

  well tell us then lassignac
demanded in his peremptory way

  	 the people told us they warned
us we must stay in camp and not
leave it but juan felista one of
our company heeded not he went
out into the night-to meet some
woman it was-and returned not in
the morning we searched we found
him-here he shivered and crossed
himself-senores his back was
broken-like that-and his chest
crushed in and he was a very
powerful man

  arnheimer and connaughton the
leaders of our party looked at each
ether arnheimer was a german
who had gone native connaugh-
ton was an american of certain bril-
liancy and uncertain passions his
particular crony was darrell with
whom he had hunted the world and
had been hunted in turn

 bah darrell exclaimed a
jaguar ill bet

  no no senor the rafter pro-
tested   it could not be a jaguar a
jaguar tears with his claws and he
rips the throat with his teeth this
-this demon-he crushed juan
felista was crushed-as you take a
reed and crush it in your hands  
arnheimer was listening carefully
the rest of us were listening too
but somehow i felt that arnheimer
was at home among these people and
would know if they were lying or
simply imagining things it sounds
strange he said after a minutes
thought a snake-but we have
no large snakes any longer not in
these parts farther north perhaps
the endocrine monster



in the deep jungles but hardly
here what think you senoresf he
asked the rest of us

  mostly we shrugged our shoulders
and looked wise janis however
made a slight gesture to call atten-
tion and asked did you see any
tracks  

  the rafter nodded yes senor
there was a streak through the grass
and some giant footprints beside it
it surely must be a demon the
blessed mother protect us

  oho connaughton burst forth

	then there were tracks i thought
demons never left tracks  

  tracks or not lassignac bris-
tled we shall see well look for
the thing unless the senores feel
that their well-being can not be
risked he added with an insuffer-
able air of patronage

  darrell surveyed him with a cold
stare you damned little porcu-
pine ill size up your well-being in
a moment  

  lassignac made a gesture which
was an insult in itself you ameri-
canos bah you always know so
much and then you dont 

  darrell let out a blood-curdling
screech and yelled one more slant
like that and over youll go right
to those damned jacares just look
at the pretty things clap their jaws
and then he laughed

  janis interfered whoever is
sent to the alligators the sender fol-
lows him ill see to that his
voice was chilly and they all knew
that he meant what he said tall and
thin with a look of innate refine-
ment he seemed out of place in that
bunch still it was the sort of thing
he liked he had trained for medi-
cine but hated to practise and
hopped around the world in search
of adventure

  janis words stopped the quarrel
and we turned to the rafters

 but what of san lorenzo

asked don ramon do they know
of the demon there

     oh yes they know  

  and have they seen it

  no senores nobody has seen
the demon they are afraid to they
would see-and then die

  arnheimer stroked his beard and
evolved another question   but what
becomes of the tracks or didnt you
follow them

  the rafter shivered at the memory
and grew pale senores he said
hoarsely they stopped at the body
of juan felista and then-then dis-
appeared   

  well i like that said con-
naughton with a chuckle that sound-
ed rather ghoulish under the circum-
stances but didnt you follow to
the place where they started

  the rafters hemmed and hawed a
bit and finally admitted that they
had been afraid to follow the trail
into the forest and that was all we
got out of them

  it was a bit unsatisfactory but
just enough to whet our appetite for
more we resolved most certainly to
pay the peninsula del circulo a visit
and speculated on what we might
find

  a few days later we docked at the
village of san lorenzo below the
mouth of the brazo occidental we
had to stop there to arrange for the
ship and to buy flatboats to ascend
the brazo

nphere is not much to say about the
village except that the people
looked as though they all had mala-
ria they were listless thin to ema-
ciation with a muddy unhealthy
color the swamps of course

  during our evening meal in the
single cafe i noticed connaughton
getting very restless he was always
restless but now he was worse than
ever pecking away at his food drink-
ing a lot and eyeing the seiioritas on
the square before the rest of us fin-


weird tales

ished with our meal he arose
stretched gave us a smile and mur-
mured   im off see you later  

  darrell called after him care-
ful ned that demon you know

  we were surprized by connaugh-
tons departure all except darrell
who shrugged and said in explana-
tion its always that way with
him every few weeks if it wasnt
for the women connie would be one
of the biggest men in the states in
whatever line he cared university
man and all that had plenty of

money to start with but- he

stopped himself as if he had said
more than he intended women
huh  he muttered

   but senor darrell don ra-
man complained this senor con-
naughton-will he be back tomor-
row to go up the brazo with us

  darrell shook his head dont
know hell come back when he
pleases perhaps tonight perhaps
not for a couple of weeks oh dont
worry about him hell catch up
with us neds always there when
the divvy comes

  there was little to do that night
except to loaf and talk and finally go
to bed next day too we lolled
around except arnheimer and don
ramon who were arranging for flat-
boats and men to take us up the
brazo late in the afternoon don
ramon told us he had got the boats
but we would have to do the pol-
ing ourselves unless we cared to wait
over for several days since the mor-
row was some sort of church holiday
on feast days these people would not
work

  well a little perspiration will do
us some good janis said reflective-
ly sweat some of this rotten alco-
hol out of our system and harden us
for what is coming in the gran
chaco

  toward sunset the place began to
fill up the feast days and sundays
brought many people to the village

we were told and as in many other
catholic countries celebration began
the eve before the feast the people
were dressed in their best and were
rather interesting lots of them were
spanish portuguese and italian in
origin but most of them rather mixed
in blood i thought

  after our evening meal we were
again seated around a table in the
patio all except connaughton who
had not yet returned but there
were more people now chatting
drinking singing and playing al-
together it was getting lively occa-
sionally there would be dances solo
or in pairs

  somewhere near  oclock i noticed
a young woman slip into the court
through a small side entrance her
movements were sinuous reminding
one of a cat but remarkably graceful
a light mantilla was thrown over her
head so that we could not see her
features but she was young that
was evident from her movements

  she sat down a few tables from us
with a flirt of her wrist she flung
back the lace mantilla and then we
saw her face when i tell you that
i have never forgotten that face you
can imagine that it must have im-
pressed me to this day i see it
vividly before me just as i saw it
that night yet when i try to de-
scribe it it evades me

  it was beautiful there was no
doubt about that beautiful with that
warmth and class of the high-bred
spanish type to this was added
something of the somber sadness of
the indian yet it seemed to me that
there was also a certain wildness a
strange ferocity hidden there again
it seemed as if she were not quite a
woman since there was an incipient
angularity about the jaws and fore-
head such as one finds in men in their
late twenties and in women in their
fifties

  her figure too while slender and

beautifully rounded seemed some-
the endocrine monster



how to have larger and more angular
proportions than the delicate ones
one expects to find in a girl her
hips for instance were larger than
necessary some of our athletic girls
these days look that way at times

  even so i am not sure that i am
not permitting ensuing experiences
to superimpose later impressions on
that first impression after all i
was only a lad at the time just
out of college and not yet twenty

  as she ordered her wine her voice
sounded melodious but throaty with
a curious huskiness

  ill admit she interested me and i
could hardly keep my eyes off her
the rest felt the same way so they
told me later in fact almost every-
one in the patio seemed to feel like
that

  she drank silently her brilliant
eyes darting hither and thither then
the music struck up and with a sud-
den jerk she arose and swept into a
dance in the center of the court it
was one of those rapid castilian
melodies which later changed into a
slower movement

  this girl danced with marvelous
grace doing the intricate steps with
the assurance of long practise she
seemed to vibrate life then as the
music took up the slower air she
changed she twisted and turned
and swayed and shook her gestures
seemed to beckon her body seemed
on fire with life

  from somewhere i caught the re-
mark it is the fair bonita

  of course that meant nothing to
me what got me was her dancing
i had seen some pretty passionate
stuff in those hot-blooded countries
but this was more than passion it
was invitation

tonita stopped with a final whirl

    at once there was a torrent of
applause in which we joined calls for
more and offers of drink someone

reached over to seize her arm and
again i was startled with a quick
move she thrust the hand aside but
the force of that blow was sufficient
to hurl the man clear to the wall
breaking down intervening tables and
chairs

  around us the people spoke bon-
ita is very strong she is stronger
than a man they murmured

  surely strange i thought beyond
a momentary angry flash in her eyes
bonita gave no further sign of dis-
pleasure she smiled and nodded to
the people then she caught sight of
us-evident strangers in that village

  her eyes widened then grew small
with sudden resolution

  she came toward us with a feline
swagger the mantilla draped over
her shoulder hands on her swaying
hips eyes flashing and lips curled in
a fascinating smile she moved
slowly each step an alluring swag-
ger till she reached our table and
stopped before don ramon

  there she fastened her eyes on him
and he seemed to be held as if hypno-
tized they stared at each other
bonita with her head tilted inviting-
ly don ramon apparently irresolute
not a word was spoken between them
but don ramon began to flush a slow
red he got up muttered an excuse to
us and left with the girl

  so don ramon likes women too
darrell remarked cynically

  this woman this bonita said
arnheimer where does she come
from

  we inquired and someone said
she lives in a cottage on a small
farm at the edge of the forest a lit-
tle way above the peninsula del cir-
eulo opposite the rapids of the brazo
occidental  

  where the demon is darrell
asked

  the man looked startled by the
wounds of christ senor do not men-
tion that we are all of us afraid of
it of that thing whatever it may be


weird tales

all except bonita she has never
been harmed  

  and she is not afraid lassi-
gnac queried

  not the slightest she laughs at
our fears but senor we have seen
them the dead ones right in that
jungle near the peninsula at the
edge of the swamps all killed the
same way all crushed with their
ribs broken and their backs broken
holy mary it was terrible  

  but were any of them eaten
janis put in

  the man looked a bit surprized at
this question he pondered for a
while before he answered   no   he
finally said   the bodies were
crushed and left there

  a strange demon janis mused
all animals kill either for food or
in self-defense here apparently it
is not a desire for food still it is
hardly conceivable that any human
would attack a being so powerful that
it can crush in defense  

  arnlieimer nodded in agreement
may i ask how long this has been
happening and how many have
been killed

  the man eyed the two with fear-
ful interest careful senores i
hope you do not intend to attack that
-that-whatever it is

  janis smiled no hardly that
but answer our questions

  a little more than a year ago i
think was the first time that someone
was killed

  from this village

  no and that is strange senor
it is always people who are visitors
here like yourselves

  darrell laughed shortly doesnt
sound good for us does it

  janis waved him to silence and
asked how many were killed
we are not sure senores two
sometimes three a month and many
we probably never found bonita
told us of cries and shrieks and
groans not far from her house but

when we went we did not always find
anything  

 humph did bonita ever see
this-this-demon as you call it
no senores

  someone just then called our in-
formant and that was all we could
learn since others seemed to know
even less

  well that settles that said
darrell i move we look up that
thing its got me going

  very well announced lassi-
gnac i too will go or i will
lead he said with insufferable
grandiloquence and where a las-
signac leads others may well follow  
cut out the trumpets and bass
drums you fish darrell snapped

well all go together and-

  arnheimer stopped him with a
gesture no we can not go he
said tomorrow early we must
start don ramon should be-should
be rid of the girl by then and per-
haps connaughton will be back too
we can not bother with these side is-
sues in view of the purpose of this
trip

  that settled the matter for the
time

but don ramon did not come back
after breakfast next morning we
looked in his room and found his bed
untouched nine oclock came and
the bells in the decrepit old church
began to ring for mass and our
partner was still absent so we de-
cided to look for him whether he
liked that or not

  since we knew he had gone with
bonita we inquired the way to her
home we could take the road we
were told such as it was which led
past the cottage or there was a
shorter way if we followed a faint
path along the edge of the swamps
the latter would be nearer but was
not much used on account of the
mosquitoes and tke danger-from
the demon
the endocrine monster



  despite the caution we decided to
take the path figuring that don ra-
mon would hardly return quite open-
ly along the road but would take the
concealed way

  we found the path boggy and dark
and thick with mosquitoes fortun-
ately we had head-nets with us so
we were protected at the most vital
points the jungle got thicker as we
went on hedging in on the path un-
til we seemed to move between two
solid walls of vegetation later we
skirted a swamp and the trees grew
thinner although the ground vegeta-
tion was a greater tangle than ever
finally we seemed to be leaving the
river since the ground became firmer
and the trees more scattered much
like some of the open parks in
texas

 and then we saw white water
ahead

  hello exclaimed darrell who
was in advance that must be the
brazo but how the deuce-

  yes said arnheimer appar-
ently we have got onto the peninsula-
del circulo

  the lair of the demon darrell
laughed ha we werent going to
look him up but were here after
all

  we may find him lassignac
cried excitedly   and then-  

  janis smiled amiably and then
we go right on were here to look
for don ramon remember lets
strike back along the peninsula and
see if we cant find our path again
we must have lost it somewhere im
sure  

  so we turned away from the rap-
ids toward the neck of the peninsu-
la as we went along we saw signs
of clearing of human activity
camping spots of course where the
boatmen and rafters had laid over

  darrell once more in the lead sud-
denly stopped and pointed to some-

thing in the grass connaughtons
cap  he exclaimed

 we crowded around him there
lay the cap beside the path as if
carelessly dropped we all recog-
nized it at once

  hes around here somewhere
said darrell oh ned oh con-
nie he called

  we joined him in the call but ex-
cept for the noise of birds and in-
sects and the chatter of some little
monkeys we heard nothing like an
answer

  fll bet hes around here some-
where darrell insisted in a curi-
ously fiat tone lets look for
him

  although he didnt say it we knew
what was on his mind we saw his
face suddenly grown pale and
strained and i feel sure that the
rest of us looked no better

  have the demons got connaugh-
ton was what he had left unsaid

  we had brought our revolvers and
automatics avith us silently we drew
them and then wo spread out to
search 

  the point where we found con-
naughtons cap was at the neck of the
peninsula so we were moving to-
ward the main river bank the
ground vegetation there was a bad
tangle and difficult to get through
but in places it would leave fair-sized
spaces covered with lush grasses
looking like comfortable spots for
camping i had xeached one of these
grass plots when i noticed that it
looked somewhat different from the
others i had examined as if some-
one had sat there and kicked holes in
the sod not recently that is but a
day or two before you know in
such moist places tracks do not keep
long

  well i did my best to follow them
the tracks led through the bushes
over other grass plots it was chiefly
by the broken branches and tom


weird tales

leaves that i was able to follow at all
finally i came to a thick group of
trees on a small hillock i dared not
approach directly so i moved side-
ways around the elevation trying to
pierce the gloom of the thicket look-
ing carefully up and down prepared
for every attack

  half-way around i caught the
glimpse of something gray i stopped
and watched sharply no movement

i bent down to look along the ground
and there in the semi-darkness i
could discern something like a body
in gray linens the humming of flies
and the odor of decaying flesh ap-
prized me that something else might
be close by

  i called to the others meantime
i looked for some sign of a wild beast
but saw and heard nothing seeing
the others approach i pushed for-
ward through the bushes

  there twisted strangely eyes pro-
truding and glassy blood oozing
from the distorted mouth lay don
ramon he was quite dead that was
evident and a little farther partly
hidden behind the bole of a tree lay
another body clad in white ducks

  even before i saw the face i knew
it would be the body of connaughton
flesh-flies were swarming around it
in masses he must have been dead
fully twenty-four hours in those
latitudes flesh decays rapidly you
know

  my god its don ramon ex-
claimed darrell the first to come up
his glance flew to where i stood
and over there he came over
and saw the body ned he
groaned

  he turned ghastly pale and for a
moment i thought he was going to
faint but he sank to the ground and
there he sobbed the hard broken
tearing sobs of a man it was agon-
izing to hear him

  beside don ramons body stood
lassignac pain unutterable on his

frozen features till then i had been
inclined to despise the chap as a
heartless braggadocio now his sor-
row drew me to him arnheimer and
janis had come up also and stood
there silently but with a look of iron
resolve on their bleak faces

  they were all a strange even
piratical crew but it seems a hu-
man law that man must love some-
thing or other so darrell had loved
connaughton and lassignac had
loved don ramon and had gone
with them into ciimes and unholy ad-
ventures moralists will jeer at such
affection i did not then nor do i
now there was a weak spot in the
moral make-up of every one of them
they knew it of themselves and
recognized it in others and perhaps
it was this community of weakness
that had drawn them together like
and like as the old blurb puts it

it was janis who finally roused dar-
rell come jim we have
work to do 

  darrell shook himself and got up
yes weve got to find-that-that
thing

  janis was examining the bodies
with professional sureness ribs
crushed back broken in both he
said as if someone had embraced
them  

  but what barked lassignac

  surely no human don ramon was
strong as a gorilla ive never seen
him beaten  

  janis shook his head wonderingly
i dont understand this as we
said the other day there is no animal
that simply embraces and crushes
his glance took in arnheimer who
was moving away slowly looking at
the ground the tracks of course
lets look for them

  damn it yes darrell cried and
swung in beside arnheimer

  it was clear that the latter had
found something for he was moving
the endocrine monster



forward away from the hillock
since they were careful not to step
on the tracks i could see them my-
self what i saw was a streak lead-
ing from don ramons body and be-
side it some oblong footprints of
huge size but spaced the length of an
average persons step in the dank
lush grass they were quite clear

  they led through the undergrowth
between trees until we reached an
open space where they mingled with
a lot of miscellaneous tracks there
the grass had been pounded down as
at a picnic and with this we saw
other evidence

  thats blood darrell ex-
claimed thats blood or im a
fool heres where the thing got
connie and don ramon and then
dragged them to that hillock  

  arnheimer nodded quite true
they evidently fought here see how
the grass is stamped into the ground
but there is a confusion of tracks
here we might circle the spot and
see if we can find any other tracks
like those going to the hillock

  we adopted the suggestion some
of us going one way the rest in the
other direction at a point opposite
our starting place we met

  nothing we were puzzled and
somewhat frightened what was this
thing that could leave huge foot-
prints and still vanish in thin air i
did a little perspiring right then and
there and shed not a few ripples of
goose-flesh let me tell you

  it was janis again who found the
solution humph he said if
this were africa id say it was a
gorilla or some such apelike creature
but this is south america and as
far as i know there are no large apes
here that eliminates that of
course there is a possibility of a huge
ape but it is not probable lets take
the probabilities first before we both-
er with the improbabilities darrell
you and lassignac circled the other

way did you see any other tracks

besides those giant footprints we were
looking for

  i no-oh wait a minute
darrell looked perplexed for a mo-
ment then turned quickly and re-
traced his steps over here he
called back   over here  

  we ran after him there were
tracks there not at all like those we
were seeking but as if some human
had run lightly through the grass
the grass was nearly upright but the
marks were still discernible

  thats what i mean said janis
lets take the normal probabilities
whoever ran here is certainly human
and may know something of what
happened here further since these
tracks look fairly recent-certainly
not older than the things footprints
-then this human must have seen
and must be made to tell and note
that the tracks go only one way-
away from the spot and also away
from the hillock with-the bodies
that human must have made tracks
in coming here and since none are
visible they must be so old that they
are wiped out just as those of don
ramon who certainly came to this
point last night are wiped out
hence this person must have been
with don ramon at the time sus-
picious indeed yes

  there was no need to urge us on-
ward in a few minutes the new
tracks led us to the outskirts of a
small farm where they vanished near
a hut at the edge of the forest the
hut was hardly more than a hovel
just four walls of mud mixed with
straw and a small lean-to

  no sound came from the hut with
youthful impulse i moved forward
ahead of the others and sneaked up
to a small window from within
came the regular breathing of some
sleeper i peered into the gloom on
a bed of straw covered with a light
m

weird tales

blanket lay some person-a woman

i thought

   i reported back at once it was de-
cided to wake her and question her

  better be careful said lassi-
gnac there may be more than one
there  

  his voice had a peculiarly pene-
trating quality and he spoke louder
than he had intended for at once
there was some stirring in the hut
and a few seconds later the door
opened and there stood-bonita

  ill be damned said darrell in
disgust for some reason we had for-
gotten about her although we knew
that she had gone with don ramon
the night before but we were looking
for something monstrous and hideous
and grotesque for in our minds only
that sort of tiling could be associated
with the fiendish killing of our
friends and others yet here was the
brilliant dancing girl of yesterday
and the tracks led straight to her
door i was befuddled completely
so

let me question her said janis

  without waiting for a consenting
reply he addressed her senorita
where is don ramon   

  with her streaming hair and
dressed in a sacklike garment she
looked the indian part of her rather
than the spanish i mentioned to
you didnt i that she was of mixed
blood she didnt appear to be the
least bit embarrassed or afraid in
fact she faced us with a certain reck-
less confidence such as one sees in
boxers when they are sure of having
an easy time with an opponent

   janis repeated the question

  she smiled and shook her head
senores i know not where he is
she said

  but you must know janis in-
sisted softly why did you run
away from him during the night
out there in the forest

this time she did not smile but

looked at janis with sharp eyes i
ran away she said slowly i ran
away because-because that-that
thing came i heard it-and then
ran

  janis eyed her contemplatively

	 this-this thing as you call it-has
it ever attacked you   

  oh no senor it kills only-
men and here she laughed rather
gleefully it gave me the shivers

  if that is true if it attacks only
men then why did you run away
from don ramon and leave him   
this time janis had scored now
i saw the purpose of his questions

  bonita saw it too but she
snapped her fingers   oh la la i
just heard-and ran

 you-you ran-you who are
very strong when your strength
added to don ramons might have
saved him janis continued with
emphasis his eyes gleamed with
sudden light yes and connaugh-
ton too  he added sternly

  bonita became enraged at janis
insistence what care i for these
men   she flared   i could kill them
myself i could kill you she
stamped the ground in anger and
i will i will she screamed

  darrell came running from behind
the hut we had not seen him dis-
appear he had moved so quietly but
now he came in a rush waving some-
thing at us

  ive got them shes the mur-
derer   he called pointing at bonita

  you-you she-devil  he bellowed
at her though youre only a wo-
man blast you youre going to die
and die right now he flung the
things he carried into bonitas face

  as they fell to the ground we saw
what they were just large oblong
strips of leather fastened to a pair of
ordinary womans shoes-thats all
but at once we understood how the
tracks in the forest could be made
with them most certainly these--
the endocrine monster



well this footgear had made those
extraordinary footprints

 you-you demon you mon-
ster darrell continued furiously
you killed connaughton and
dragged him away you killed don
ramon and dragged him away i
dont know how you did it but i
know that you are going to die for it
get ready you

  darrell swung up his automatic

  	 good god  i muttered i
couldnt understand at all was
darrell really going to shoot this
woman what had she done left
connaughton and don ramon to be
killed so i thought certainly he
couldnt mean that he believed she
did the killing herself

  i moved toward darrell to stop him
and tried to call him but i never
said what i wanted to say

tt happened like a flash bonita
whirled to one side and darrells
gun roared he missed her with a
tigerish spring she was on him

  and then i saw what i never would
have believed had i not seen it my-
self with a quick blow she knocked
the automatic from darrells hand
then she flung her arms around him
darrell fought furiously screaming
curses but that was only for a mo-
ment and then i saw his face turn
crimson his eyes seemed to pop from
his head we heard a dull crash a
smothered gurgle blood rushed from
darrells mouth and he was flung
aside broken dead

  this woman still not much more
than a girl had crushed a grown
man to death

  i think none of us moved the
speed the ghastly horror of it had us
paralyzed

  but bonita swung around with
fury in her eyes i was close for i
had jumped to intercept darrells
shooting and she seized me i
wanted to tear away but i was help-
less my own boasted strength like

that of a babe against hers she
grabbed me by the arm pulled me to-
ward herself and embraced me

  i felt an agony of shock tingling
to my forehead and fingertips a
surging protest a revolting horror at
the inhuman thing that was happen-
ing to me then everything went
black and i knew nothing more

  apparently i was out only a few
minutes as i awoke i felt numb
and helpless with some difficulty i
rolled over and tried to rise it was
painful something in my side ached
furiously stabbing me as i moved-
a broken rib as we found later

  janis and arnheimer were stand-
ing near me while farther away las-
signac was busy winding ropes
around an inert body that body
was bonita unconscious or dead

  what-what has happened i
wheezed

  janis turned around oh you
are alive  thank god i feared she
had gotten you after all

  feel half alive i said all
right otherwise only weak in the
back and ribs but whats hap-
pened to bonita

  janis threw her arnheimer an-
swered struck her in the neck or
back of the head

 no janis corrected i
thumbed her on the vagus nerve the
pneumogastric you know a little
jap trick i learned over in kioto
you may have heard of it i wasnt
sure i could shoot quick enough or
straight enough to prevent her from
crushing you so i thumbed her and
made her faint lassignac is tying
her up with all the ropes he can find
hope theyll hold her if they dont
-he paused reflectively-well we
may have to shoot her yet

  lassignac was still winding ropes
around bonita until she began to
look like a bandaged egyptian mum-
my even at that i had my doubts
about the ropes they were old and


weird tales

rotten weathered from lying around
outside but perhaps if the quality of
the rope was not enough then the
quantity might do

  thats what lassignac seemed to
think he was winding away with
fervor muttering and cursing under
his breath

  i got up slowly and went over to
gaze at bonita just then she woke
up recollection came swiftly to her
what are you doing she demand--
ed of lassignac

  i could see that the latter was
furious with her and with himself
the former because his friend don
ramon was dead the last because he
was doing something that went
against the grain against the innate
chivalry of his nation and he hated
himself for it under such circum-
stances a man is likely to go farther
than he intends so lassignac

  i am binding you he snarled
i will see you hanged you female
brute you fiend you arch-murder-
ess he screamed bah cochon
and then he kicked her

  it was a beastly rotten thing to do
but as i said under a strain a man
may do things he would normally
think impossible

  bonita seemed to shiver for a mo-
ment then-it happened so quick-
ly that i couldnt quite follow-she
just seemed to bound from the
ground the ropes falling from her
like so many broken threads in the
same upward motion she seized las-
signac and before we could prevent
she hurled him with terrific force
against a tree where he crashed and
lay inert

  she turned to the rest of us our
guns had come up at once i can tell
you no we didnt shoot at that
i am not so sure that our bullets
could have stopped her unless they
tore her to pieces that uncanny
concentrated energy and demoniac
strength needed more than bullets to
stop

  but our bullets were not neces-
sary

  she had thrown lassignac with
such force that the impact had shak-
en the tree and there was some-
thing up there that was disturbed
and didnt like to be disturbed as
bonita pivoted toward us something
like a rope yellow and shiny slith-
ered down from above to her shoul-
der hung there for a fraction of a
second and dropped to the ground
from there it moved through the
grass toward the jungle not smooth-
ly but in a series of leaps and
bounds much as a eoiled bed-spring
bounces when you throw it and
finally disappeared in the thickets

  none of us had seen it clearly but
we all knew what it was from the
way it moved it was that deadliest
of south american snakes the fer
de lance swiftest and most venomous
of reptiles

  im glad it didnt come this
way arnheimer murmured pale to
his eyes

  bonita had scarcely moved since
the snake struck her already her
eyes were filled with horror and fear
and scarcely half a minute later she
began to writhe in the first paroxysm
of pain no we could do nothing for
her she had been struck in the
neck close to the jugular vein a
direct path to the heart she twisted
and screamed in her agony it was
gruesome and i almost felt sorry for
her

  it didnt last long just a few
minutes brrr i shudder at the
recollection the discovery of the
bodies of connaughton and don ra-
mon was terrible to us and terrible
too was the sight of darrells death
but most terrible is the memory of
the woman bonita rippling and
heaving under the action of the poi-
son

  well its over thank god said

a grim story of the death of mankind

the ruler of
destiny

 by charles hilan craig

with an ironic smile upon his
face the ruler of destiny
rode through the streets of
the greatest city there was in
that smile of irony something of dis-
dain a little of pride a great deal of
triuitiph-but never a vestige of pity
as the great limousine rolled along
the densely crowded street he watched
the hurrying crowd-hurrying the
lord alone knew whither and as
he sucked the smoke from an expens-
ive cigar deep within his lungs he
watched that crowd with the con-
scious positive knowledge that he was
their master

  the master of destiny he called
himself and as yet he alone of all
the world knew why the others
who had known were dead he was
alone in his secret it might prove a
hindrance if others knew so he had
seen to it that none other did know
the chemists for instance-the three
of them who worked in the masters
laboratory-they had known and
now they were dead but more of that
later and there was his chief as-
sistant who had died the night after
their final discussion of the great
thing which had come to pass
wood alcohol had been the doc-
tors cryptic verdict but the master
knew better there is a more subtle
poison than wood alcohol it works
more quickly and with no chance of
failure investigation  no far from
it for who would think of investigat-
ing such a man as the master-a man

whose beck and call were commands
to the politicians

 and so this day he rode among
them smiling sardonically rode to
the war office where the politicians
were awaiting him ready he
thought to kowtow before him for
what he was-their master for the
war must be won at any cost and
was he not the man of the hour the
master of destiny the ruler of fate
the man who could by a wave of the
hand wreck the opposing annies

  he was not just fat in the usual
sense of the term his corpulence
was of the type which one associates
with swine his cheeks bulged his
eyes were tiny orbs of blue steel set
in soggy pockets of baggy flesh his
chins bounced up and down with
every movement he made and his
body-ponderous sweaty powerful-
reminded one of nothing in the world
so much as a husky hippo

 instinctive dislike yes but
ones feeling toward the man did not
stop there nor did it after all begin
there for to the ordinary person
there seemed to be about the person-
ality of travis bannister a sinister
quality which imparted a touch of
that sort of discomfort which writers
usually associate with a haunted
graveyard at the midnight hour for
some men to look into the blue eyes
in the bulging face brought a sensa-
tion of terror for the braver-hearted
a feeling of icy cold


weird

tales

  he was a scientist and that he
was a remarkable scientist there is no
doubt not that he was a delver of
the usual type far from it not in
fifteen years perhaps had he handled
the actual apparatus of his craft but
his ponderous brain worked out mar-
velous theories which his assistants
put into execution

  it was his wont to sit in a huge
armchair under an electric fan and
sip his liquor while in his soft wom-
anlike voice he gave directions to his
employees mix a with b and one
has a certain combination mix ab
with c and the mixer might in all
probability be blown to damnation

  but travis bannister was never in-
jured by his experiments for when
the result of his chemical combina-
tions was at all uncertain his instruc-
tions were given over the telephone
and tragedy stalked after these tele-
phoned instructions to his aids many
times there was for example the
young college graduate who was or-
dered over the wire to perform a cer-
tain experiment and within five
seconds thereafter where the house in
which he had been working stood
there was nothing but debris a ter-
rible hole in the earth bore mute wit-
ness to the catastrophe again there
was the time when three assistants
were killed by a new kind of poison-
gas which ate through their masks
and suffocated them

  travis bannister was sorry that
these things happened very sorry
but dont mistake me-it was not be-
cause of any sympathy for the vic-
tims but rather because costly and
rare apparatus was lost in each case

tt had been during the world war
that travis bannister had turned
his attention to the making of poison-
ous gas he took an intense interest in
it-as he always became interested in
that which would cause suffering and
death but it was not until after the
armistice that he turned his undi-

vided attention to the perfection of a
thing so diabolical in its very im-
mensity as to bring a shudder of hor-
ror to the war lords who were used
to diabolical contrivances of all kinds

  for travis bannister had several
years after the end of the war in-
vented a type of gas which would
wipe out of existence the entire hu-
man race and so when in the year
 the nations of the world had
locked in mortal combat and his own
nation was getting decidedly the
worst of the fray because of an in-
adequate air force travis bannister
mailed a letter to the war depart-
ment

  the committee of nine sat about
the long table in the war office dis-
cussing the latest phase of the strug-
gle when an orderly entered handing
to the chairman a sealed letter

  slowly the chairman as though he
realized its importance opened the
letter and with grave face read
there was some potent thing in the
very atmosphere which came to head
on delivery of the letter-what it was
one could not guess the chairman
read and as he came to the end he
smiled but there was in that smile no
hint of mirth

  he read the letter aloud

the war department

sirs

   realizing that our forces are hard pressed
i hereby volunteer to win the war for our
country in so doing i shall introduce a
poisonous gas which will under proper
direction exterminate every living plant
and animal in the enemys country i am
sirs

the master of destint

  silently the letter was passed about
the table an intangible something
emanated from it bringing to the
members of the committee a sensation
of impalpable gloom

  they called the telephone number
given and asked the master to come
before them and presently he was
announced by an orderly who said
the ruler of destiny



sirs a gentleman who says he has
an appointment he calls himself
the master of destiny sir  

     show him in   returned the chair-
man

  and so travis bannister came into
the presence of the committee of
nine assembled in the war office to
discuss the question of avoiding in-
evitable defeat he came in fat and
bland and suave and smiling that
cold ironic chilling smile

  bannister exclaimed the chair-
man so its you

  yes replied the huge man in
that soft even voice which made one
involuntarily hate him i sir am
the master of destiny

  just what do you mean by that
bannister

  bannister smiled icily

  what do you suppose i mean
dear sir but i shall explain i
mean that i am your master that

 

  are you mad

  -that i am the worlds mas-
ter

  the members of the committee were
nonplussed never before had a man
come before them save in humble
mien and now there was stealing
through the blood of each man there
that terror which the sight of the
gargoyle invariably brought

  and then he was explaining in that
voice of horror which made men grit
their teeth to keep from screaming
i have invented a poisonous gas
sirs which will at my dictate annihi-
late the entire world

  but how- began the chair-
man

  bannister waved a pudgy hand
deprecatingly

  i shall explain and then you can
tell me what you will do i have hi
my laboratory two tremendous ma-
chines lately perfected one of them
generates a gas so terrible that it
brings instant death to any form of

life-plant or animal the other ma-
chine is a counter-agent

  let me tell you my plan the
gas machine can be assembled any-
where and set going and the gas will
follow the wind at the same time
the counteracting machine can be set
going the poison gas will travel
about the entire world killing as it
goes it is too heavy to rise high in
the atmosphere and it will not evapo-
rate or disintegrate to the best of
my knowledge it will without the
counter agency exist several years

  now on the other hand the coun-
teracting gas will be generated here
and will form a transparent wall
which will keep out the poison the
poison depends on the wind but the
protecting gas can be guided by radio
activity the other nations of the
earth shall be destroyed and we shall
prosper presently the counter-
agent turned on full force will de-
stroy the gas and then we can stretch
our empire over the entire world
the immensity of the suggestion
stunned the committee

  but if this is as you say what
will happen to our allies asked the
chairman it will take a long time
to form a protection for them-and
the enemy is coming

  the tiny blue eyes of travis ban-
nister lit up with a demoniac light

  who said anything about our al-
lies   he said coldly   they can die
also  

  do you mean sir asked the
chairman that we shall destroy the
population of the world at one stroke
with your machine

  oh it will take time

  but ultimately the whole world
will die save us  

  yes

  but think of the non-combat-
ants   

  they do not interest me

  but the women and little chil-
dren


weird tales

  theyll die sometime came the
cool reply

  good god man are you a mon-
ster

  the cold smile disappeared from
the face of the fat man a diabolic
expression so malevolent in its dis-
tortion came over his face that the
committee trembled

  you shall vote he said harshly
you shall vote now whether to die
at the hands of the enemy-or be
saved i have a personal interest i
am the richest man in the nation i
want my property protected vote  

  we shall vote said the chair-
man trembling

  sir said the admiral of the
fleet i have never believed that our
country could lose but rather than
destroy the whole world i shall sur-
render   

  there was a ripple of acclaim about
the table the chairman was himself
again

  we thank you mr bannister
he said but we feel that wc would
be slapping the face of god to com-
mit such a crime as you suggest

 the jowls of travis bannister
were blue with anger

  remember sirs he said you
have refused the master of destiny
lie glared upon them for a moment
and passed from the room

tt was the next day that the last
air-defense line broke and the
enemy was ready for his last thrust
upon the greatest city and the coun-
try behind every available airship
was hurled into service ready to turn
the invasion but as the war commit-
tee sat in their office they realized
that they represented a beaten na-
tion the radio had announced the
enemy fleet on the way at tremendous
speed terror-stricken people were
milling in the streets before the war
office-some praying some shrieking
blasphemy some fighting

  the jangle of the telephone

  a voice soft and cold over the wire
said the enemy is on his way

    he is  snapped the chairman
there is yet a chance say the
word and i shall start the machines
never

    do you want to die   

 not with that crime on my
hands  

  fools i am the master of des-
tiny you and your people shall die
with the enemy but i shall live and
protect my own a last chance do
you want to live

 never under your administra-
tion  

  then die came the cold voice
of fury   sir you are talking to the
last man who will live upon this
world you can see the roof of my
building from your windows
watch

  i shall watch

  look to the east fool look to the

y y

  the chairman rushed to the win-
dow there on the horizon was a
growing cloud now the size of a
mans hand-but it grew larger

  gentlemen said the chairman in
his cool precise voice the enemy is
upon us shall we prepare to die
watch had been the masters
command and the committee
watched i shall save my own had
said the master they watched the
laboratory roof in the distance they
saw running figures they saw a
thing which looked like a gigantic
cannon raise its ugly mouth to the
heavens another cannon watch
a deep reverberating boom sounded
across the city purple fire burst
from the mouth of the cannon rolled
out with the wind toward the oncom-
ing horde of airplanes a hissing
mass of purple fire gloriously tinted
at the edges iridescent but hideous
as death with the wind rolled the
fire billowing changing color

  the airplanes were close now too
close in a gigantic triangle they
the ruler of destiny



moved first the scouts then the
fighting helicopters then the giant
bombers behind all came the diri-
gibles the pop-pop of the protecting
anti-aircraft guns the rattle of ma-
chine-guns and then-

  the mass of purple smoke and fire
met the coming horde a vast chaos
the wind blew on the smoke issued
no longer from the laboratory-a
stream of purple fire the fire and
smoke dissolved but the oncoming air
fleet was no more though here and
there a plane rolled drunkenly in mid-
air without a guiding hand the gas
of the master of destiny had wrecked
the greatest air navy in the world

  saved breathed the chairman
then he gasped in utter horror
pointed toward them was the great
gas gun it belched flame and smoke
-death the committee did not try
to run they were ready for the end
they saw the gas leap toward them
on wings of vengeance-the gas of the
master a faint breath of it in their
nostrils they saw people a quarter-
mile away falling saw trees shrivel
a faint odor then they died

the blighting breath of the great-
est war mankind ever had known
had left its terrible mark on every
nation in the world millions of men
countless millions of dollars worth of
property had been wiped out by the
contrivances devised by men to de-
stroy other men the bravest and
best of every nation participating in
the gargantuan struggle had been
destroyed the flower of the worlds
best manhood was no more and
those who were left in the armies of
the world were plunging into the
same chaos behind the women took
up the mens work the remaining
men-the misfits and failures of life
-were hurled into the breach in a
vain attempt to stave off disaster

  and then through the radio came a
sinister tale of wo that brought fear

to the rest of the world first a wild
rumor then verification terror

  from the top of a great laboratory
went the tale a huge cannon was
sending gust after gust of poisonous
gas into the air which burned with a
purple fire which seared like a white-
hot brand through any gas mask ever
devised a gas that would not dis-
integrate a gas against which there
was no protection already in the
greatest city where the machine was
located every man woman and child
was dead every plant and animal
was no more-with one exception
travis bannister still lived in the
laboratory about which a pink nebula
had formed a protecting wall

  terror and chaos ruled the world
the radio spoke wild and improbable
tales nations of people were dying
dead and then through the air
waves there came a message-an ulti-
matum 

  to the remaining people of the world

  cease fighting and bow to my will and 
will yet save the world from destruction
but only on this condition-that i am to
be named the sole ruler of the entire world
submit-or die

the master op destiny

  never said the ruler of a great
country we will fight to the end
said another but rumor on rumor
came over the air death ran ramp-
ant through the earth and at last
the countries of the world yet in ex-
istence agreed to submit over the
air went the token of surrender

tn a little room of a great laboratory
j- building the master of destiny re-
ceived the reports from the nations
surrender unconditional surrender
and as the last report came in he
walked ponderously to the roof and
threw on to the full the power of the
counter-machine which had hereto-
fore been throwing off gas sufficient
only to maintain the protecting wall
about his buildings a gigantic spurt
of pink flame soared into the air with
a hissing grandeur a crash of


weird tales

sparks the breaking of steel the
pink fire died the counter-machine
was dead

  then for the first time in all his life
the face of travis bannister wore an
expression of fear the fat lips
parted in horror the tiny eyes wid-
ened as realization came over him

  too soon had he put the machines
into operation the one was per-
fected but the other was inadequate
realization through the world
blown hither and yon by the winds
of destiny the poison gas seared a
path more arid than the deserts
trails no longer was there a counter-
agent it would now be only a mat-
ter of time till that devastating flame
had destroyed the life of the entire
world then he would be left alone-
the only living thing in a dead world

  feverishly he hurried toward the
lethal machine to turn off the power
but out from the machine came ter-
rific waves of heat that beat him back
and he knew then that the gas would
continue to come till the engine of
death had melted away and then
when he had decided there was noth-
ing left for him to do he betook him-
self to the radio room there to await
the last reports from a dying world

  out of africa came the news of the
strange gas that was strangling the
people out of south america came
word of the people dying by tens of
thousands and even as one radio
speaker gave the word a death rat-
tle came into his throat and travis
bannister listening knew that the
gas had reached him

  day after day day after day the
winds blew the poison about the
world there came an hour when only
one radio operator in all the world
remained he was situated in aus-
tralia and it was with mockery that
he spoke to the master of destiny
with the bravado of a doomed man

  are you listening master of des-
tiny are you listening yon
should be satisfied now for all the

  world is dead save you and me all
the world is dying save you for even
now the gas is slipping in through my
supposedly gas-proof room sweeping
in like a dread blight all-are-dy-
ing ah the hands-of doom-are on
-my throat i-am dying master
of destiny-may god-have mercy-
on-your soul

  might god have mercy on his soul
it had been a long time since travis
bannister thought of god

  it had come everything was
dead save only him dead one re-
maining life in all the world the
days passed and he watched that pink
aura about his laboratory and
through it he could see the purple
tentacles of disaster pushing push-
ing pushing the counter-machine
was dead the gas cannon still was
hurling its horrible product into the
dying atmosphere he knew not how
to stop it

  and now the purple was beating
back the pink closing in upon even
the master of destiny was it pos-
sible that he too must die die by
his own diabolic invention

  he visioned the approaching end
and he knew beyond a doubt that it
would be an end of horror for re-
lentlessly a little at a time but in-
evitably as the sun the purple would
press in the pink till it suffocated him
crushed him down slowly vastly
more slowly would he die than those
victims of his had died and so the
last man upon the earth became
afraid of the justice of fate	

  even the air was dead now for
there were no plants left to return
oxygen long since he had started
his oxygen machines going utter
silence reigned  his footsteps when
he walked were ponderous and the
sounds reverberated in his tortured
ears as the cannonade of war never
did hour after hour of stark silence
-the silence of the grave

purple streamers were slipping in

  a ntony wayre felt that he
could never forget the hor-
a- ror of that night even when
the actual experience had been for-
gotten and lived down there would
be intervals of madness when the
whole scene was reconstructed in his
memory what sylvia his wife
thought no one knew for she held it
closely to herself all her energies
were given to keeping antony from
brooding

 	it all happened without any pre-
 liminary warning whatever antony
 and sylvia had bought a small cot-
 tage called romans in glouces-
 tershire since the end of the war
 antony had been indefinite in his
 plans unable to get a decent job
 anywhere that would bring in suffi-
 cient for their wants and yet give him
 time to go on with his own writing
 then at the end of  his god-
 mother was killed in a motor smash
 and he found himself the possessor
 of five hundred pounds a year long

    w tv-

before in the ordinary course of
events it would have fallen to his lot

  he and sylvia had at once started
to look for a country cottage where
they could settle down with what
he expected to make by writing an-
tony judged they could manage well
on his new income by living quietly
sylvia was fond of gardening and of
a country life and she planned to
breed chickens and ducks for their
own use as well as to grow fruits and
vegetables

  after much hunting they found
romans and knew it was the
home of their choice the cottage
was small and compact built at the
top of a hill two miles from the vil-
lage but only a quarter of an hours
walk across the fields from a small
market town the nearest neighbor
lived at the bottom of the hill

  the first month they were there
passed without noticeable event they
were both in love with the house
both busy all day and tired and

                                   


weird

tales

healthy enough to sleep perfectly at
night had they not done so it is
just possible that they might have
had some warning of the horror that
was to come upon them

shortly after christmas antony
wayre went to dine with the doc-
tor who lived in the house at the foot
of the hill sylvia was invited but
there was a thick white mist from the
valley which had risen even to their
altitudes and as she had a bad cough
and cold she decided to stay at home
by the fire

  antony being a good husband
and remembering that his wife was
alone in the house-for their daily
help went as soon as she had laid
the supper-did not stay long with
the doctor and was walking up the
hill again by half-past 

  the mist was rolling up in strange
white shapes and by the time he had
reached his own garden gate he could
not see the lights from the doctors
house nor any of those from the out-
lying villas of the town usually to
be seen through the trees he pulled
his scarf up more closely round his
throat and shivered a little

  suddenly he was aware of a
strange feeling in the garden it was
hard to define hard to pin down to
anything in the least definite yet it
was strong enough for him to stand
still and peer around he was
strangely conscious of the presence of
a second person

  the feeling was so strong that
antony called out sharply whos
there wondering if some thief was
hiding in the garden with intent to
despoil the chicken run but there
was no answer the white mist rolled
up in deeper waves till it seemed to
engulf him it was becoming hard-
with the mist and the darkness-to
see even the garden path in spite of
his electric torch

  shrugging his shoulders antony

went on to the hall door rather to
his surprize it was bolted he
knocked twice and as he did so the
feeling that he was accompanied
grew stronger

  a minute later sylvia opened the
door and half dragged him into the
hall shutting and bolting it with
feverish rapidity

  hullo whats up asked an-
tony naturally surprized then re-
membering his own sensations he
asked as casually as he could   have
you been frightened did you think
you heard someone about

  sylvia laughed nervously and
backed into the drawing room

  no oh no she said only-
only its the first time you have been
out without me and i suppose i got
a little nervous theres a nasty mist
up isnt there the house seems
full of it

  antony knew his wife too well to
take her words at more than face
value he could see that she was on
the verge of hysterics and cursed
himself soundly for having left her
alone even for a few hours he
ought to have remembered that she
was not used to the country and that
the silence was bound to affect her
nerves

  very deliberately with the im-
pression of infusing an air of every-
day life into the situation he divest-
ed himself of coat and scarf put his
stick into the stand and lighted a
cigarette then he went into the
drawing room where sylvia was wait-
ing for him the door wide open so
that she could watch him in the hall
the room was as she had said de-
cidedly full of mist but it was not
too badly lit for him to see that her
eyes were wide with horror and her
hands trembling as she sat down and
picked up her knitting making a
feeble pretense at normality

  sylvia what is it antony
spoke sharply his own nerve was be-
out op the earth



ginning to falter what has hap-
pened are yon frightened

  she lifted her eyes from her work
and nodded her head

    tony tony   she began and her
voice held a sob of fear in it tony
i dont know what it is but theres
something dreadful about this place
tonight it-the feeling i mean-
came on about an hour ago ive been
sitting here praying you wouldnt be
very late i began to think i should
go mad  

  antony shook off the creeping hor-
ror that was beginning to possess him
also nonsense darling he said
as cheerfully as he could you
arent feeling very fit your colds
pulled you down and your nerves
have given out i was a fool to leave
you tonight forgive me dear ill
make some cocoa shall i and well
have it here by the fire before we go
to bed

  his effort at normality seemed to
pull her together but she would not
leave him alone almost clinging to
his coat she went with him to the
tiny kitchen and helped to fetch the
kettle and the tin of cocoa curious-
ly enough there was hardly any mist
in the kitchen it seemed to have con-
centrated in the diawing room

  something to do with the aspect
of the house antony thought to
himself but he did not comment on
it to his wife

  over the cocoa sylvia seemed to
become happier though she jumped
badly when a log fell out of the fire
on to the hearth

  what did you talk about at the
doctors she asked

  antony shrugged his shoulders
everything he said with a smile
the birth- and death-rate of the
village poultry feeding-by the way
hes got some wonderful food mixture
he thinks you would like to try-
local history and so on he told me
too that there used to be a roman
settlement here and thats why this

cottage is called romans appar-
ently at one time it was a pretty big
place and then it died out but
every now and then the farmers turn
up old weapons and things when
theyre plowing

  sylvia nodded i wonder if the
hens will scratch up anything she
said they work hard enough i
believe theyre going to do well its
a bad time of year to start them
though

  i suppose so antony spoke
sleepily what about a move up-
stairs that fire has almost burned
itself out

a s the words left his mouth he be-
came aware once more of that
other presence for the last few
minutes it had left him now it was
back and even more strongly than
before he glanced at sylvia she
was looking over her shoulder at the
door and there was fear in her eyes

  i-i dont think i want to go to
bed just yet she said in a strained
voice antony im afraid its
come back again 

  dont be silly dear he said
encouragingly and all the time
knowing that it was he who would be
silly if he set foot outside the door
somehow he knew that it-the hor-
ror-was in the hall-that he himself
might have paved a way for its
entrance when he came into the
house

  the lamp gave a sudden flicker
and then went out the oil had been
exhausted sylvia gave a little cry
of dismay the room was now lit
only by the dying fire antony
dashed to the window and dragged
back the curtains the mist had lift-
ed and a pale moon shed a gleam on
to the floor and the grand piano

  antony went over to the grate and
picked up the poker all the while
aware that it was a useless weapon
then he went toward the door
whatever it was out there he meant


weird

tales

to face it he could not endure the
thought of being beaten in his own
house but as he laid a hand on the
door-knob he drew back something
was on the other side something so
strong so definitely evil that every
fiber of his soul recoiled by instinct
from facing it he could not co-or-
dinate his muscles for a moment he
stood still dumb then he pulled
his scattered senses together and
turned round

  sylvia was standing behind him
white as the moonlight her eyes big
and dark her fingers moving tremu-
lously antony went up to her and
slipped an arm round her waist

  darling he said weve got to
see this thing through

  what is it what is it tony
she asked half sobbing

  god only knows-or the devil
he returned grimly

  his arm round her waist still they
retreated to the far end of the room
their eyes were seemingly com-
pelled to remain on the door would
it come in what did it want
when would it go away

after what seemed hours of wait-
ing sylvia gave a little cry and
pointed to the floor antony fol-
lowed the direction of her finger
over the threshold under the door
was coming a slow thick greenish
vapor that rose slightly in the air as
it was forced into the room by the
pressure of a further discharge be-
hind

  my god gasped anthony
whats that

  clinging to one another backs
against the wall they watched and
waited while the vapor increased in
volume till it seemed to fill a quarter
of the little sitting room then they
realized that it was as if it were kept
within confines of its own that
was in one way the most horrible
thing about it it- did not spread
and diffuse as gas would do but

moved in a solid bloek with cumulus
edges

  for a moment or two nothing more
occurred then sylvia cried out
again its taking shape staring
horror-stricken they saw that this
was indeed the case out of that
solid wall of greenish gas-a foul
horrible green that reminded them of
rotten slime and duckweed-certain
portions were growing together were
becoming a form and as the hor-
ror did this so did the foul smell
grow greater till they could hardly
breathe the air round them it was
suffocating them

  antony made a supreme effort
and without loosing his hold of syl-
via jerked his elbow through the
window the raw night air came in
with a rush but it eould not dispel
the vapor inside the edges of the
block wavered a little for a moment
but that was all

 sylvia was sobbing quietly bury-
ing her head on antonys shoulder
trying to shut out the sight a sud-
den catch of his breath made her
look up again and she shuddered
sick with fear

  the form was growing clearer
now the central part of the green
gas had become a being an entity
such as they had never seen before
swaying backward and forward
raised slightly above the floor but
without visible means of support was
a travesty of a man-grotesquely
limbed and featured but the chief
horror lay in the expression never
had antony or sylvia conceived that
such bestiality such foulness could
live in any semblance to the human
face it seemed incarnate evil and
it swayed toward them with a leer
coming imperceptibly closer every
moment

  antonys back was against the
wall he could retreat no farther
sylvia lay upon his arm half-faint-
ing with terror
out of the earth



  somehow by some strange instinct
antony knew that he must make no
effort to get out by the window
that outside was the creatures own
ground at a disadvantage here he
would be utterly lost if he made any
attempt at a fight in the garden the
thing must be faced here and now
it was coming closer the fetid smell
was overpowering helpless antony
lay splayed against the wall it
could be only a question of minutes
perhaps only a few seconds before
he and sylvia would be engulfed in
this ghastly sea of evil that eman-
ated from the foul horror in the
room

  his hand groping wildly round
touched the poker but he made no
effort to pick it up knowing that
such a weapon could do no good his
eyes roamed wildly round seeking
for help was there nothing that
could save them were they to be
possessed forever by the thing to
fall hopelessly iriedeemably into its
clutches

  sylvia gave a little moan and
fainted dead away on his arm her
head rolling to one side the shaft
of moonlight caught a ribbon round
her neck antony saw it unthink-
ingly then with a glimmer of hope
with his free hand he jerked at the
ribbon and dragged out the little
silver crueifix she always wore

  the time for drastic measures had
come the horror was only a yard
away antony felt that he himself
could not keep his senses much long-
er he dropped his wife on the floor
and stood in front of her the crucifix
held at arms length his eyes on the
horrible black depths where the crea-
tures eyes should be

  for a long minute he stood there
taut as a bow-string concentrating
all that was left of his strength and
the thing wavered swayed backward
then forward while a sudden wave
of noisomeness engulfed antony
dimly he realized that this was the

crucial moment that it was doing
its utmost to crush him then with
one last supreme effort he flung the
silver crucifix straight into the mid-
dle of the mocking bestial face cry-
ing in the name of christ be-
gone

  there was a sound of rushing
wind a cry so terrible that it rang
in his ears for weeks and the hor-
ror disseminated and disappeared
leaving the room filled with the raw
night air from the broken window

  then antony fainted also

the doctor was already in bed and
asleep when he was roused by
the pealing of his night bell and
looking out saw two figures at the
door he hurried down and to his
surprize antony and sylvia tottered
into the hall he dragged the story
from them by dint of close question-
ing

  what is it doctor pleaded
sylvia will it come again

  i dont know he said hon-
estly i dont know but i should
not stay at romans if i were
you

  what was it reiterated an-
tony

  the doctor moved his hands depre-
catingly a roman encampment
and settlement he said it has
been considered by many experts that
the hill is not a natural one but was
originally a tumulus perhaps also a
barrow and it is a well-known fact
among those who study the occult
that such places are the favorite
haunts of elementals

  mrs wayre-indeed both of you
-you have had a very fortunate es-
cape something unknown to us
some natural cause perhaps some
hidden attraction in one or other of
you had let it loose and sent it like
the devil its master seeking whom
it might devour it is only by the
grace of god that either of you can
tell me the tale

the return

by g g pendarves

-m-m might spend a night
in many worse places than
this   said arnold drys-
dale to himself as his host disap-
peared leaving him alone in the
great vaulted room lit by the danc-
ing flicker of a log-fire

  the portraits on the paneled walls
were veiled by the shadowy darkness
but beyond the circle of radiance
within which drysdale sat could be
seen the dim outline of the beehstein
grand the huddle of chairs at the far
end of the music room the pale glim-
mer of flowers in tall vases and the
clouded splendor of the gold brocade
curtains drawn across the windows

   yes its a very easy way of earn-
ing five pounds went on drysdale
reflectively lounging back in his
chair and lighting a cigarette and
whats more-i believe its done the
trick with millicent he chuckled
complacently she thinks im no
end of a hero to take on the wager
and spend a night in the haunted
room his lazy brown eyes half
closed as he thought of millicent
fayne-her youth her loveliness
her dawning love for himself and
above all her wealth nothing like
a misspent youth for teaching a man
the sort of woman he ought to
marry he concluded discrimina-
tion is better than innocence and ex-
perience than much fine love

  he looked round sharply as the
far door of the room opened and a
mans tall figure showed for an in-
stant against the lighted corridor
without before the door was closed
again and the intruder appioached

  that you holbrook said drys-
dale thinking his host had returned
to add a word of warning or advice
come back to see me hobnobbing
with your spectral friend-eh   

	its not holbrook its i    
jim mccurdie

    wha-a-a-t    drysdale sprang to
his feet why where    how
i wasnt sure if i could get here
tonight so i did not let holbrook
know i was coming-thought id just
give you a surprize

 surprize echoed drysdale
faintly his hands clenched so that the
knuckles gleamed his cigarette drop-
ping from suddenly relaxed lips to
the rug at his feet

  jim mccurdie sat down at the ta-
ble and looked across at his compan-
ion with a grin i heard you were
at your old game of playing hero
he said and i thought it was a good
opportunity of finding you alone
ive wanted this little chat with you
for the last eight years

  then you werentyou didnt

 you came back after all from
that expedition  

  yes-i came back after all
were pretty tough-we mccurdies
-and there were several good reasons
for my getting back its a bit too
late for doing all i meant to do-but
theres still one thing

  a silence fell the shadows in the
big room seemed to thrust forward to
peer and listen as drysdale sank into
his chair and looked at his old rival
opposite him-incredibly aged and
altered from the gay carefree youth
the return



whom drysdale had sent on that
deadly mission eight years ago

 then the ambush- drys-
dale bit back the words too late
against his will the fatal question had
shaped itself into words

  ah yes-the ambush you knew
all about the ambush didnt you
you urged me and my men to take
that particular route across the des-
ert knowing that ibn said and his
ruffians waited by the well of tiz for
us you cowardly-lying-thief  
the last deliberately spoken words
bit like iee into drysdales conscious-
ness and partly steadied his whirling
thoughts

  thieff he stuttered thief
thief-one who steals what be-
longs to another man explained
mccurdie leaning forward until his
eyes blazed like points of blue flame
into those of his companion drys-
dales gaze fell before them and he
half rose from his seat

  sit still ordered mccurdie
ive come a long way for the pleas-
ure of meeting you once more and
now youre going to listen

  dont make a fool of yourself
sneered drysdale his confidence re-
turning as he began to adjust him-
self to the situation thief-you
call me he shrugged his shoul-
ders jean kennedy was quite
ready to be stolen if thats what you
mean

  you tricked her and lied to her
and deceived her you left her to
die miserably-as you left me
thats your own rotten imagina-
tion at work answered drysdale
she went abroad the year after you
-er-disappeared no one ever heard
what became of her

  she went to bruges-she lived at
a mean little inn called le chat gris
-and died there when her son-and
yours-was bom

  drysdale started back his nonchal-
ance again stripped from him how
the devil did you-

  mccurdies lean brown hands toyed
with the match box on the table i
know where she lies buried in the
paupers graveyard down by the
river-she and her nameless son i
know that you stopped her allow-
ance when her reproaches annoyed
you and that she became a wretched
half-starved slave to the innkeeper
pere grossart and his drunken
wife  

  damn you-you paid them to tell
you this fairy-tale   blustered drys-
dale

  i have never spoken to them in
my life was the answer

  liar no one else in the world

could know that she-that i-

  so-you corroborate the story
no curse you i dont shouted
drysdale getting to his feet
youve found them out by accident
and concocted this tale to try to ruin
me

  before you ruin millicent fayne
-as a climax to your varied career
drysdales angry face changed the
red faded and ugly unexpected lines
appeared round his mouth his
brown eyes were suddenly hard and
calculating

  so thats your little game he
said at last were rivals once
more i did not know yon had ever
met millicent he went on youre
  f
going to try to use my guilty past
as a weapon very neat-i see-i
see  and turning to the whisky and
soda which stood on the table he be-
gan to fill his glass

cor a moment the other man sat
very still looking steadily at
drysdale then pushing back his
chair he got up and stood with his
back to the glowing fire his thin
brown hands elasped behind him

  i thought that even you would
see such an obvious thing mc-
curdie rejoined at last youll
leave here tonight-now in fact
	weird tales

  all the baffling violent emotions
that had possessed drysdale during
the last few minutes boiled up sud-
denly within him his interlocutors
words of easy command setting a
match to his fury with a swift un-
controlled movement he hurled the
glass he held striking mccurdie full
in the face

  there was a sharp hissing sound as
the liquid splashed onthe hot tiles
of the hearth and the glass shiverftd
against the mantelpiece a few feet be-
hind mccurdies head

  good god drysdales voice
was a mere thread of sound as the
eyes of the other man continued to
look stedfastly into his own who
-what are you

  i am jim mccurdie whom you
sent to death eight years ago in the
desert of tlat

  drysdale gasped and held on to the
back of a chair while the familiar
surroundings of the music room re-
ceded to vast distances and a swim-
ming darkness enveloped him then
slowly reason asserted itself how
absurd of him to think even for a
moment that the glass had passed
through mccurdies head it was
merely an effect of the firelight and
his own jangled nerves

  it appears you did not die-in
spite of my efforts he answered
with a barely perceptible tremor in
ms voice

   was buried by the well of tiz
with six spear-wounds through my
body

  drysdale looked stunned for a mo-
ment but a lifelong habit of disbe-
lieving what he did not understand
conquered his rising fear

  either youre jim mccurdie or
his double in any case youre mak-
ing a nuisance of yourself he said
finally and drawing an automatic
fiora his pocket he leveled it at his
companion who had moved until he
stood with his back to the paneled
wall at the right of the fireplace i

am going to shoot you if you did
not die in the desert youll die here
and now i shall say i thought you
were the ghost that haunts this
room 	

  i am the ghost replied mc-
curdie i have waited eight years
to get back again and tonight gave
me my entrance to the world of hu-
mans once more in this room there
is power i could adapt to my needs-
power to materialize-to borrow for
a brief time a visible human garment
for my soul

  splendid answered drysdale
with a sneering laugh you always
had a powerful imagination mc-
curdie well i am going to deprive
you of your garment once and for
all

  he raised his arm and a shot rang
out-but the tall figure stood motion-
less before him the blue eyes steady
on his own

  curse it muttered drysdale

this light- he fired again and

yet again die cant you he
shrieked stumbling up close to that
quiet figure and putting the muzzle
of his weapon to its breast he fired
one shot after another in rapid suc-
cession then fell with a wild yell of
laughter to the ground the smoking
revolver clenched in his fingers

holbrook was the first to find him
lying there and hastily dropped
his handkerchief over that agonized
grinning face before the startled
guests and servants poured into the
room

  the paneled wall to the right of
the fireplace was riddled with bullets
but no sign of blood-no foot nor
fingerprint of any assailant did the
keenest man from scotland yard ever
discover

  what or whom drysdale had tried
to shoot was never known-for the
dead can not speak or if they do

they are not believed
humdrum indeed must have
been the existence of that
man who having reached
middle age can look bak on no epi-
sode or occurrence in his past life
that was either uncanny outre or in-
explicable by the ordinary laws of
physics when a man has been
blessed or otherwise by being the
chief actor in such incidents he has
food for speculation for the rest of
his natural life and perhaps beyond
let skeptics scoff-who can blame
them not having taken part in the
happenings themselves-but i hav-
ing seen sensed ad felt what i have
find it impossible to laugh off

  it was back in the s in the early
days of my novitiate as a united
states customs guard that i was as-
signed the offshore detail on the
passenger steamship glory of the
west as she lay tied up at the broad-
way dock in san francisco one win-
ters night well do i remember it
to the uninitiated i may explain

there were three blinding flashes of
light even before garcias hissed you
lie was fairly uttered

that the duty of the offshore or deck
detail of the customs guarding force
consists in preventing the smuggling
of goods by boat or otherwise off the
vessel by way of the offshore or
waterward side

  brrr what a disagreeable night
despite my heavy overcoat and muf-
fler i shivered a fine drizzle driv-
en by a cold gusty wind seemed to
penetrate to my very marrow as i
tramped up and down the deck with
feet heavy and chill as two chunks of
ice

  i heard quick footsteps approach-
ing-ah the lieutenant of the watch

  hello said a cheery voice

  hello lieutenant i returned

  hows everything he asked
gazing round and taking in the gen-
eral surroundings

  oh everythings all right i re-
plied at least as right as it can
be when youre cold and wet and
miserable this job of guarding-
officer is no snap if every night


weird tales

were like this one id ehuek it up and
go to heaving coal

  its a pretty nasty night thats a
fact said wood sympathetically
especially for the offshore detail
but this is only one night cheer up
stallard therell be other nights fine
nights that youll enjoy and thatll
make you feel glad to be one of uncle
sams boys youd better go below  
he continued and have the ships
watchman fix you up a cup of coffee
ill relieve you for a few minutes

  a fine chap that john wood a
man with a heart freighted deep with
sympathy and thoughtfulness for his
fellow-man no wonder he had the
love and respect of the whole watch

  i hastened down to the deck below
by way of the port gangplank and
soon was enjoying the warmth and
cheer of the snug little galley pres-
ently i rejoined the lieutenant feel-
ing greatly invigorated and re-
freshed after a few more words he
left me to resume my solitary vigil

  the wind hummed in the rigging
and the rain swished down on the
slippery deck glistening in the glow
of the distant dock-lights the
winches alternately hissed and
purred over the main hatch like
great cats crouched in the shadow of
the forward cabins waiting for their
prey i tarried often before them
for their slight warmth was grateful
it was good to clasp the steam pipes
and thaw out the griping cold from
my numbed fingers

  seven bells half-past  chimed
from some lime juicer anchored
near-four long hours before my re-
lief would start from the distant
mail dock at the other end of san
franciscos waterfront i thought
ruefully of my warm bed at home
why the devil should there be such a
thing as night work why couldnt
everybody sleep at night like white
folks as the good lord intended

t walked aft and looked over the
dreary expanse of the bay over-
hung with the misty curtains of the
night the faint light on yerba
buena island vaguely blinked a
sleepy warning to the mariner ven-
turesome enough to risk his craft in
the jaws of the storm and ever and
anon the hoarse murmur of the fog
signal on alcatraz boomed across the
heaving space like a deep sonorous
snore

  i stood close by the door of the
smoking saloon it was unlocked i
knew for i had tried it before i
turned the handle and peered into
the gloom within a soft delicious
warmth enfolded me for it was the
sailing day of the glory of the west
and her steam pipes were full i
stepped inside and sat down on the
end of the richly upholstered settee
that ran along the wall framing the
doorway leaving the door slightly
open so that i could see almost the
whole length of the deck forward
and a wide stretch of waters along-
side surely i thought from this
point i should be able to detect and
prevent any attempt at smuggling
overboard at least nothing could be
pulled off in the short time it would
take to thaw some of the chill out of
my bones but would i be perform-
ing my strict duty

  while still debating this conflict
between desire and duty i heard a
light step ascending the heavily car-
peted stairs leading from the dining
saloon i turned and beheld a mess-
boy lighting the two lamps in the
smoking room in which i sat i was
still wondering at this proceeding
which was unusual at this time of the
morning when i heard voices and
more footsteps three men came up
from below

  i was fairly caught and though
ashamed to be found in this equivocal
position pride would not permit me
to seem to run away so i assumed a
look of indifference and kept my seat
shadows cast behind



i wondered how it happened that
passengers were already on board
for although the vessel was to sail
that day it was not customary to al-
low them to come aboard so long be-
fore the sailing hour i judged that
they were passengers because they
did not look like seafaring men they
wore no uniforms nor any of the
habiliments of seamen

  one of them said something i did
not catch to the messboy who nodded
and softly retired below no one
noticed me nor indeed even seemed
aware of my presence

  of the last comeis one was a big
broad-shouldered man with ruddy
bearded face and enormous hands
the second small and dark-skinned
with glistening black eyes and long
mustachios while the third was tall
and slender blond and smooth-shav-
en-evidently an englishman from
his speech and appearance

  the big man offered a cigar to each
of his companions and they all seat-
ed themselves at the starboard table
near the opposite wall the big man
to the right the dark man to the left
and the englishman facing me where
i sat on my settee shrinking against
the wall near the door

  well mottinglv began the big
man in a deep booming voice which
he tried to make low and subdued
i hope that bite weve just had will
change our luck its a new one on
me i generally sit through a game
till ive had enough a gambler
would think it unlucky but we aint
superstitious are we anyhow we
cant have no worse luck than we
been having garcia turning to
the dark man whatre you goin
tdo with all your winnings lemme
sell you a mine put your money
back in the groun where it come
from an let her grow he laughed
but the englishman only frowned-
the look on his face was stern the
muscles tensely drawn

  the man addressed as garcia
smiled showing a set of very white
teeth instinctively i disliked him

  what me he said with a
shrug oh i no can count my
weenings till she be hatch ha ha
ha he laughed at his own attempted
witticism

  the big man laughed back dont
you try to hatch nothin now garcia
cause you aint no farmer

  their pleasantry was here inter-
rupted by the return of the messboy
with a tray containing a bottle three
glasses and two packs of cards which
he set upon the table the english-
man seized the bottle and poured a
drink for each i could see his hand
tremble slightly as he drank a gleam
came into his eyes as he cried now
for our revenge eh thompson let
us be at it

  he shuffled a pack of cards and
they cut for the deal the big man
dealt and i saw that the game was to
be poker no chips weie used only
the hard coin with which all ap-
peared to be plentifully supplied

  they played steadily for a half-
hour or more the big man losing
slightly for he played very cautious-
ly the englishman losing heavily
while the bright yellow gold rose in
ever-growing glittering piles at gar-
cias right hand

  the strained look in the english-
mans eyes grew more tense the
frown on his brow deeper he drank
often and i could see that he was
gradually losing his nerve

  at last the big man said say
mott i think weve had enough lets
quit

  no exclaimed mottingly testily
you drop out if you want to luck
is bound to turn for me sometime
damme ill make it or break the
blasted bank

  verry well senor spoke gar-
cia yawning eef you weesh we
queet i queet i am the so tire i
sleepy


weird

tales

  no said thompson quietly
with a sharp glance at the last speak-
er ill stay in

rthe game went on again but much
more silently with an under-
current of something sinister some
force not apparent on the surface of
play and conversation

  i was becoming aware of a feeling
i could not explain a message-i
could not yet comprehend what-
was being telegraphed to me by my
subconscious mind once i thought
-but no i must be mistaken else the
others would have noticed it yes
there it was again i was sure i
could not be wrong this time i was
indignant shocked in my excite-
ment i had almost risen to my feet
and was pointing to garcia the
words ready to shout on my tongue
when something in the englishmans
attitude held me spellbound the
blue tinge had faded from his face
it was now white as snow his jaws
were set the lines deep-drawn while
the flesh seemed to have receded from
the bones of his cheeks but he was
cool ah so cool his hands were
steady as a rock as he laid down his
cards so then someone else had
seen it too his actions and ap-
pearance seemed silently to call a
halt in the play all waited for him
to proceed it was his move

  he coolly struck a match and
lighted a fresh cigar i say gar-
cia he commenced i have no
more money with me youve cleaned
me out but heres the deed to the
lone pine mine that i just paid mr
thompson  for ill stake the
mine against your pile there and
what you won from us last night
which ought to make it about even as
near as i can figure it-

  hell no broke in thompson
dont do it mottingly let the
stuff go you cant buck against such
a streak of bad luck as youve uncov-
ered but the mine is a good one and

will pay it all back to you in a short
time  

  mottingly raised his hand as if to
command silence

  garcia played thoughtfully with a
stack of coins letting them fall to
the table with a rippling sound
ah he observed softly i deed
not think meester motting-a-ly she
shall need one-ha-nurse  

  thompson flushed redly motting-
lys jaw set more firmly but he went
on evenly as though there had been
no interruption provided he
spoke slowly and distinctly almost
hissingly provided mr thompson

deals the cards-

  what-a for that cried garcia
quickly his teeth showing in an evil
snarl his eyes flashing luridly from
the ghastly greenish yellow of his
face

  all three were leaning forward in
a crouching attitude and were un-
consciously slowly rising the light
of understanding had broken on the
face of thompson now livid with
fury

  otherwise went on the tense
slow almost monotonous voice of
mottingly otherwise you will re-
fund to him and to me every cent
you have won from us

  there was an instants pause the
situation was tense the adversaries
-now such in earnest-were keenly
eyeing one another each studying the
situation and calculating chances
the sword of fate hung by a hair

  garcia spoke coolly now almost
contemptuously but there was a fur-
tive hunted look in the eyes that
glanced rapidly from one to the other
of his opponents and over and beside
and beyond them for why you
ask-a that meester motting-a-ly
you spick verry-ha-strange-what-
a for shall i to geeve to you the
money i have win

  they were now all on their feet
because thundered mottingly
raking the spreading pile of gold to-
shadows cast behind



ward himself with one hand and mak-
ing a qniek backward movement with
the other youve been dealing from
the bottom of the paek youre a

damned cheat i saw-

  there were three blinding flashes
of light even before garcias hissed
you lie was fairly uttered fol-
lowed by a crash

ttello said a voice aint you
afraid of the ghosts

  the ships watchman was holding
a lantern up to my face with one
hand while the other was on the
handle of the door which evidently
had just banked shut

  what ghosts i gasped

  why the ghosts of three men that
killed one another over a game of
cards in here about twenty years ago
i heard it from the mate that was on
her at the time

  were they all killed i inquired
regretfully

  yep there was an englishman
an american and a chileno there
were two empty shells in the chi-
lenos gun an one in the americans
the englisher didnt fire a shot-
wasnt quick enough on the draw i
guess that chileno was a bad one
professional gambler had six notch-
es on his gun already they say their
ghosts come back every once in a
while so you wanta look out for
em

  say i said quite irrelevantly
are there any passengers aboard
he gave me a strange inquiring
look as he answered no not yet
nobody aboard cept me an you an
some o the crew why

  phew i said without answering
his question its close in here
guess ill go out and get some fresh
air

  how grateful the damp coolness of
the outside felt i looked at my
watch it showed  only five
minutes since i had consulted it last
i could not credit it i held it to my

ear-yes it was still running i
seemed to have spent hours in that
accursed smoking saloon and yet in
reality it had been only five minutes

  the rest of that interminable
wateh i passed in deep thought
wondering speculating doubting up
and down up and down the melting
deck i tramped well forward
though not venturing abaft the main
saloon amidships i shivered but not
from the cold alone

itold no one of my adventures but
made cautious and veiled inquiries
at the steamship offices the person-
nel of the company naturally had
undergone many changes in the last
twenty years and i could find no one
who remembered any tragedy con-
nected with the glory of the west

  at last i bethought me of that
treasury of pioneer californian his-
tory the daily alta-california one
of the first san francisco newspa-
pers i spent many of my spare
hours poring over its back files and
eventually my industry was reward-
ed by the finding of an account of
the death of three men passengers
on the american steamship glory of
the west in a gambling row sub-
stantially as related by the ships
watchman

  in the cases of the american and
the chilean the coroners jury had
rendered a verdict of death by gun-
shot wounds each at the hands of the
other in the case of the english-
man however they had allowed that
grim and perverted sense of humor
common in those days even touching
the most sacred and solemn subjects
to move them to bring in a verdict
that the deceased had come to his
death by suicide consequent on
paralysis of the dexter digits the
victim proved to be a remittance man

the second son of lord c- and

the remains were turned over to the
british consul


weird tales

 i was so profoundly impressed
that i determined to follow the mat-
ter up in an effort to learn just how
accurate the details of my dream or
vision might prove

 by inquiring at the consulate i
learned that the father of the mur-
dered mottingly was still alive
thereupon i addressed a long and
carefully worded letter to lord

c-in which i related my vision

in detail and added a copy of the
newspaper account of the tragedy
and of the coroners distorted find-
ings i wound up my recital with a
request for a photograph of his de-
ceased son to identify and verify my
dream picture

  so long a time passed that i had
begun to believe my communication
had gone astray when i received a
reply as follows

honoured sir

  in behalf of my client lord c- let

me premise with a statement of his grati-
tude and appreciation of the great service
you have rendered him and his family at
such pains and labour to yourself

  some twenty years ago the body of the
unfortunate young man the second son of
his lordship arrived here accompanied by
a copy of the death certificate containing a
statement of the verdict of the coroners
jury as to the cause of death

  i may here state en passant that father
and son had parted in anger several years
previously after a stormy interview over
the subject of the young mans drinking
and gambling habits his lordship there-
upon disowned him denied him the use of
the family residences and dismissed him
with a lump sum and the injunction never
again to enter his presence until he had
proven his manhood

  but unfortunately his failings had too
strong a hold on him to be shaken off here
surrounded by his old associates and he
emigrated to the states where he drifted
about until his means were exhausted his
father turned a deaf ear to his appeals for

further assistance but lady c-- his

mother kept him liberally supplied with

funds as i happen to know it being my
province to attend to the remittances

  these circumstances together with
strong religious scruples and his stern
judicial temperament as a magistrate of
the queens bench caused his lordship to
refuse permission to place the body in the
family vault no doubt you are aware
that an ancient law of england now obso-
lete required that a suicide should be bur-
ied at a crossroads with a stake driven
through his middle

  the remains perforce were consigned to
unconsecrated ground from that time

forward the suite in the c- mansion

formerly occupied by the deceased was ac-
cording to the servants haunted by the
spirit of the young master wailing and
crying to be gathered to his ancestors

  your experience while it would be inad-
missible in court as legal testimony in
conjunction with your interpretation and
explanation of the grotesque and frivolous
verdict of the coroners jury and the mute
evidence of the two guns so strongly im-
pressed his lordship and the lay and
ecclesiastical authorities that the body has
been exhumed and placed in the family
crypt with appropriate ceremonies

  his lordship was also greatly moved by
your graphic description of his sons manly
stand in the last act of his life drama

  it may interest you to know that since
the disinterment and re-burial the servants
assert all ghostly manifestations by the
young mans alleged spirit have ceased

  i have written you by his lordships
direction thus fully and frankly in con-
sideration of your kind and conscientious
services which entitle you to every con-
fidence

  i am posting under separate cover a
photograph of young mottingly and if it
be not too great a further trespass on
your time and patience my client would
greatly appreciate a report from you as to
how it compares with the picturization of
his son that appeared to you in your
vision

  assuring you again of his lordships
deep appreciation and cordial acknowledge-
ment of your distinguished favour i am
with the highest personal respect

your most obedient servant

john n d- q c

  i opened the packet containing the
photograph with mingled emotions
but surprize was not one of them
when i beheld in the shadowy like-
ness an exact replica of the face of
the man who had appeared in my vis-
ion as young mottingly

his screams were those of
a man in mortal agony

 a mongr the numerous investiga-
tions which dr ivan brodsky
made in my company i recall
the case of stuyvesant barons furni-
ture because of the poetic justice
which it brought about rarely in-
deed did any visitor from the unseen
world so thoroughly justify his ap-
pearance as in this instance or work
such permanently beneficial effects
upon the character of his victim

 we had seen no one for several
days being engaged upon a study of
peculiar delicacy in connection with
the pituitary body in the brain of a
chimpanzee when one afternoon a
loud and important voice in the par-
lor followed the announcement of the
doctors servant the visitor had in-
sisted upon entering he said and he
had been compelled to admit him
rather than suffer a scene outside
brodsky smiled rather grimly put
down the brain of the ape and went

  note-this is the eighth in a series of stories
each complete in itself dealing with dr ivan
brodsky the surgeon of souls

out into the ante-chamber motioning
to me to follow him

  dr brodsky began our visitor
when i tell you that i am mr stuy-
vesant baron you will at once know
all about me you have been recom-
mended to me by a friend of mine
whose name is immaterial as likely
to serve my purpose and you shall
be well paid for your work i want
you to come down at once to my
country home in pennsylvania

  he was a pompous individual
some fifty years of age well oiled and
soaped and starched a huge signet
ring overlapped his little finger a
gold watch-cliain stretched across his
waistcoat and he had that atmos-
phere of indescribable vulgarity and
overbearingness that is associated
with the newly enriched i knew the
man by reputation as a prominent
politician at the capital who had
achieved a large fortune recently by
rather dubious transactions i looked
to dr brodsky to give him the coup

                                  


weird tales

de grace courteous then from the
twinkle in brodskys eyes i perceived
that he was reserving this for our
future delectation

  your name is well known to me
mr baron he answered but
wont you take a chair and tell me
first what your difficulty is pray
be seated 

  mr baron reached toward a chair
and sat down gingerly upon the ex-
treme edge apparently surprized
that it did not collapse under him

  well perhaps id better begin at
the beginning and explain the mat-
ter he said you have heard no
doubt of my influence in the capital
and how i worked my way up from
quite humble beginnings to my pres-
ent position well sir it was always
the dream of my life to own one of
them country estates which its the
correct thing for a man of my status
to have ive had my eye on one for
a long time a fine place but sadly
run down it was owned by an old
southern family-plenty of ances-
tors but beggarly as church mice and
not a dollar to their credit yes
theyd fallen into disrepute and let
the place run down id been wait-
ing for them to put it on the market
and as soon as it was advertised for
sale i went to see it and i said
stuyvesant thats yours my
wifes away in europe-comes back
next month and i thought id buy it
and fit it up for a surprize for her
well doc i bought it

  theres a hundred acres or more
goes with it and naturally when i
bought the place i thought id gotten
rid of those beggarly southerners
for good and all well first thing
i knew theyd moved to a little cot-
tage they own just across the bound-
ary and installed themselves there
spoiling the view of the crick for me
i ye been trying to put them out
ever since and i think ive got them
nailed now however thats by the
way

   when i looked inside of my new
 house i nearly died of laughing
 never saw such a ramshackle-look-
 ing interior in my life doc purse-
 proud snobs that they were theyd
 sold off everything to keep up their
 station and except for a score of
 dirty old chairs two beds and some
 tables there wasnt hardly a bit of
 furniture in the house first thing
 i did was to pitch that lumber out of
 the house they saw it lying there
 and begged me to sell it to them i
 told them to take it and decay with
 it which they duly did then i sent
 for an upholsterer and ordered a
 fine suite in red plush for the din-
 ing room blue plush for the bed-
 rooms and green plush for the rest of
 the house yes sir ive fixed the
 place up fit for a gentleman

   i moved in last week to warm up
 the house for my wife got the
 servants in and all was ready to sur-
 prize her when she came back i
 went to bed the first night and had a
 good sleep in the morning going
 round to make a final inspection i
 saw one of them wretched old chairs
 that had been left in the hall by mis-
 take im a hot-tempered gentle-
 man doc and it made me so mad i
 kicked it over then i went into the
 dining room and sat down in an arm-
 chair to cool off first thing i knew
 something like a tack was sticking in-
 to me i jumped up with a yell and
 my man came running in you
 clumsy loon i cried whatd you
 mean by leaving a tack in here
 the man looked at it theres no
 tack here sir he said

     i tried another chair same
 thing it was like sitting on a red-
 hot poker the man thought i was
 mad i guess well doc to cut the
 story short theres not a chair in the
 house i can sit down on except that
 dirty old broken affair that i kicked
  out into the lot and there it rests
 ive been sitting on it ever since i
 couldnt go to a doctor and have him
the chairs op stuyvesant baron 	

call me a lunatic and lose my influ-
ence so i came to you

  may i ask how you happen to
conclude that this trouble was of
supernatural origin    asked brod-
sky

  why to tell the truth said mr
baron the house was supposed to
be haunted thats one of the rea-
sons why i bought it it gives it tone
and i didnt care to tell you but
the fact is they pinch me im black
and blue   he ended mournfully
somehow his pompous demeanor
seemed to be subsiding under the
doctors influence

 when you sit down asked
brodsky

  at all times sir cried the man
angrily the only time they dont
pinch me in that house is when im
sitting in that dirty old chair they
pinch me when im sitting and when
im standing and when im in bed
fancy me giving up the place be-
cause im pinched by ghosts id
lose my influence at once theres
mighty little place for cranks and
lunatics in this world sir so i want
you to come down right away and if
you can stop this game it will mean
 in your pocket if you cant
ill give you five

  brodsky looked at him rather
sternly i do not accept money for
this class of work he said i will
endeavor to allay the trouble if you
will make me out a check for 
to be devoted by me to any cause i
please  

  baron stared at him for a moment
then his face softened into a grin

  oh all right doe all right he
said writing a check and signing it
theres some swallows their medi-
cine straight and some wants it
chocolate-coated ive met both kinds
here you are-and put it to any pur-
pose you please he continued with
a loud guffaw

it was arranged that brodsky and
i should go down at the end of
the week about noon on the follow-
ing saturday we found ourselves at
the little country village near which
the mansion was situated the coach-
man who drove us up was loud in his
lamentations over the change of
ownership

  hes a low-down mean cuss he
exclaimed emphatically the dar-
rells had owned it for nigh on a hun-
dred and fifty years and he bought
it over their heads when they
couldnt pay the mortgage i dont
blame him for that so much but hes
trying to put them out of their cot-
tage too thats mortgaged and he
wont give them a months exten-
sion  hates to see em i reckon  

  at the door of his new residence
mr baron received us somewhat
moodily

  come in gents he exclaimed
rubbing his leg theyve been at
me like mosquitoes all morning he
continued pinch pinch-it aint
the pain its the indignity and
james thinks me crazy hitting out at
the air so much this is the dining
room

  it was the most fearsomely incon-
gruous thing that i had ever seen
the old oak paneling had been cov-
ered with scarlet paper furniture in
bright red plush coverings was scat-
tered throughout the room and on
two sides were huge mirrors with
great gilt frames that reflected the
vulgar aspect of the owner as he
paced to and fro drawn up to the
table was a plain wooden chair ap-
parently of antique workmanship
and singularly pleasing to the eye
when contrasted with the rest of the
paraphernalia suddenly our host
leaped a foot into the air and struck
out wildly at the same instant in
the mirror that faced us i saw for a
fleeting second the horrified features
of the footman in the hall


weird tales

  youll excuse me if i sit down
said mr baron sinking into the
wooden chair i give in im here
until you drive them away james  
he called and the footman appeared
instantly at the door his face again
composed james serve dinner
here i dont know whether theyll
pinch you gentlemen he added
but you can try if you like

  i sat down with some apprehen-
sion but neither brodsky nor i ex-
perienced the least uneasiness

  with your permission said the
doctor we will take a short walk
over to the darrells cottage and in-
spect these other chairs which way
is it

  over there down by the crick
said baron contemptuously i
suppose you know your business but
say doc he went on anxiously
youre not going to let on about
me are you good lord what a
scoop for them they hate me like
poison itd be my political finish
not a word said the doctor and
we went out

a walk of a few minutes brought
us to the eottage a pretty little
place from which the mansion was
just visible the wife received us
with hospitality arrd without inquir-
ing our business after the southern
custom brodsky soon drew her out
while the daughter and young son
sat by in silence

  i dont blame mr baron for
buying the place over our heads
said the woman we couldnt have
kept it up after my husband died
and we knew it had to go but hes
taken over the mortgage on this cot-
tage and threatens to put us out next
week and raze it to the ground
heaven knows what will happen to
us for were at the end of our re-
sources all our poor furniture
wouldnt net us a hundred dollars
ah pretty old chairs eh
said brodsky looking around him

  they were good in their day
said mrs darrell with some slight
touch of pride mr darrells
great-grandfather brought them over
from england before the revolution
they made good furniture in those
days-better than they do now-and
if they dont look pretty theyve
worn well but theyve about out-
lived their usefulness peters the
traveling peddler has offered me
fifteen dollars for the nine of them
and hell be here tomorrow im
thinking of letting them go

  theyre an heirloom i see like
the family ghost said brodsky
pleasantly

  the woman started and cast a
dubious glance toward him

  youve heard about that then
she asked coloring faintly they
do say there is a ghost although it
never troubled any of us

  whose is it the mans who
made the chairs   

  no indeed mrs darrell an-
swered it is supposed to be the
spirit of the old gentleman who
willed the chairs to my husbands
great-grandfather mr darrell used
to visit him constantly at his eng-
lish estate before he died the old
fellow had become greatly attached
to his chairs and in his last days
when his mind had given way a lit-
tle he used to think he had made
them he told mr darrell that he
would always be near them and that
they should never leave his descend-
ants as long as they lasted he left
them to mr darrell because he was
almost as proud of them as the old
gentleman himself they were both
fond of good furniture and the
maker-i forget his name-had quite
a reputation he died the year be-
fore mr darrell emigrated we
used to play at table-turning some-
times and the chairs used to dance
all round the table and rap out all
sorts of nonsense in the form of
acrostics i thought it was the old
the chairs of stuyvesant baron



gentleman in his crazy moods but
my husband said it was nothing but
animal magnetism

  well his prophecy has come
true   said the doctor   for they
have certainly followed you here
and i shouldnt be very surprized if
they should remain with you after
all but now i have a favor to ask
of you there have been some curi-
ous manifestations in the mansion
and we are going to hold a seance
there will you come and sit with
us it is imperative for its success

  at first mrs darrell stoutly re-
fused but when the doctor had set
his mind upon anything he usually
got it what arguments he used to
persuade her i can not recall it
seems to me now that it was his hyp-
notic powers that finally overcame
her natural reluctance anyhow
five minutes later we three were
strolling amicably toward the man-
sion

  we found mr baron waiting for
us in his chair a gloomy expression
upon his face at the sight of mrs
darrell he sprang to his feet with
an oath-and promptly collapsed
with a yell and began rubbing him-
self

 mr baron said brodsky
mrs darrell has consented to sit
with us at our seance and her pres-
ence is absolutely necessary for its
success she knows nothing he
added in a whisper sit in your
chair and she will discover nothing

  shell learn that theyve been
pinching me wont she shouted
mr baron forgetting all caution

  no for i have already thrown
her into a hypnotic condition re-
turned the doctor i would not
bring her under false pretenses but
i have already sealed her ears so
she can not hear you he turned
to the woman mrs darrell he
eaid there is nobody in that chair

  why of course not she re-

turned looking at the doctor in some
surprize

  barons mouth opened and his
eyes almost protruded from his
plump face a low wordless growl
came from his throat

  you told me i should meet mr
baron said the woman

  he is in the house but you will
neither see nor hear him answered
the doctor but come let us take
our places for the seance

we closed the doors drew up a
small table into the center of
the room and arranged three chairs
around it baron remaining where he
sat making the fourth at a signal
from the doctor i lowered the gas jet
so that only a faint light remained
just strong enough to enable us to see
each others faces mrs darrell sat
between myself and brodsky with
baron facing us we sat there for
about five minutes then the table
began to tremble as though some
convulsion were taking place intern-
ally then two faint raps were
heard

  is anybody there asked brod-
sky louder please now my
friend we want to find out your
grievances and draw up a peace
treaty with you what is your
name

  he ran slowly through the alpha-
bet when he arrived at the twenty-
fifth letter a loud rap resounded up-
on the table

  the letter y said brodsky
now the next letter please a b

c d the rap sounded at 

the next letter was u and the next
r then came five or six little raps
together indicating the termination
of the word

  your said the doctor it
sounds like the termination of an
epistle lets have the next word
then

  the rapping began again as dr
brodsky went through the alphabet


weird tales

the letters spelled out in succession
were l i t t l and e then
again came the terminal sign and
the last word was dahlia

  your little dahlia said brod-
sky impatiently thats the worst
of the seance he continued to me
rather in an aside it attracts a
mischievous and prankish form of
elemental spirit whose messages even
when comprehensible are mostly a
tissue of lies it is the least valuable
of any means of psychic investiga-
tion but unfortunately in this case
our only resource i suppose we
have got to be duped by some half-
human intelligence of the usual low
order

  there came two thunderous raps
upon the table-the accepted signal
for no

  you protest do you my friend
said brodsky grimly very well
then you shall have another chance
now perhaps you will tell us your
proper name

  three loud raps indicated willing-
ness and brodsky began to spell out
the alphabet again this time the
signature was different it contained
three words as before and they
were jim the penman

  i fancy i see some method in this
madness said the doctor ignoiing
the three raps that joyfully assent-
ed to this remark and i fancy
that our prankish friend will have
still another signature upon the third
attempt now sir let us have the
end of the charade

  the alphabet was slowly spelled
out once more this time the signa-
ture ran chips the carpenter
aha said the doctor just as
i expected yes my friend i un-
derstand your carefully veiled allu-
sions and now perhaps you will
afford us some indication of your
desires

  hardly had the words left the doc-
tors mouth when a scream burst
from barons lips in the dim light

to which our eyes were now becom-
ing accustomed i saw him slide sud-
denly from his chair to the floor-
or rather the chair seemed to be
pulled violently from beneath him
as a mischievous schoolboy might
have done to some venerable elder
and then the chair stood up solemnly
upon its back legs and began tilting
backwaid and forward kicking the
prostrate man much as a thug might
kick his wife when he returned home
drunk drunk indeed seems to be
the word most suitable for the thing
balanced itself gravely and deliber-
ately but withal with difficulty in
the intervals between the kicks
then as baron slid forward scream-
ing into the center of the room i
saw the thing begin to sidle at him
butting him like a goat finally
withdrawing a foot or more to gain
momentum it waddled solemnly for-
ward mounted his prostrate form
and executed a clumsy dance upon
the most prominent portion of his
waistcoat

  i am afraid that all the sympathy
which i should have felt was ex-
tinguished in that burst of homeric
laughter that came from the doctors
lips in which i joined there we
sat by the table rocking to and fro
speechless and apoplectic while the
chair executed its solemn ritual now
performing a pcr-s de seid upon his
chest and again balancing itself up-
on one leg apparently irresolute
what antic it should next perform
and all the while baron screamed
like an insane man yet so paralyzed
by his terror that he could not move
i knew that james would break into
the room for the screams outrang
our laughter and were those of a
man in mortal agony but i was not
prepared for the denouement

  i	heard a shuffling in the hall the
door was flung wildly open and a
towering figure appeared in the
doorway that of a woman for one
instant she hesitated then without a
the chairs of stuyvesant baron



word by instinct as it seemed she
found the exact location of the low
gas jet and turned it on there were
we at the table red in the face there
was mrs darrell beside us watch-
ing us in surprize and not under-
standing there lay baron upon the
floor dusty and battered gripping
with all his might the leg of the now
innocuous chair that seemed to have
become entangled with his head
and then i realized that mrs baron
had returned from europe

  she drew herself up to her full six
feet of height and glared at us with
a single comprehensive gaze

  stuyvesant get up she hissed

  and the fear-stricken wretch rose
slowly and painfully to his feet and
stood before her like a delinquent
schoolboy in the presence of his mas-
ter

  so this is the way you have been
enjoying yourself while i have been
away she cried these are the
orgies you have been indulging in
with these low creatures at your
country seat as you were pleased to
call it in your letters to me you
thought you could hoodwink me
your wife after twenty years of un-
happy married life but ill keep
my eyes on you from this night for-
ward you shall not get the divorce
you have been counting on she
went on becoming for the first time
hysterical

  the doctor half rose from his
chair in an instant the woman had
staggered to her husbands side 

  oh stuyvesant protect me from
these ruffians she cried my poor
stuyvesant they have lured you here
to rob and murder you come leave
this house and never set foot in it
again she fell upon his neck my
poor husband she sobbed hold
me up hold me up i am going to
faint

  she promptly did and it required
the united efforts of brodsky and
myself to brace her up

  we got her to a lounge at last in
another room baron was at her
side outside i heard the chug-chug
of the automobile as james prepared
it for the night journey nothing
would have induced mrs baron to
spend a night in the new home in
one interval between her almost con-
stant hysterics her husband stole out
to us he looked very different from
the pompous creature who had come
into the doctors office a few days be-
fore

  im glad he cried im glad
all hell seems loose tonight i
wouldnt stay here for-i wouldnt
stay for-for a street railroad fran-
chise he spluttered and im
ruined ive been kicked by a chair
ive been kicked by a chair an old
dirty chair that i threw cut into the
lot whatll they say about me at
the capital

    nothing   said the doctor
neither of us will breathe a word
of this and nobody else sees or hears
you

  whom are you speaking to mr
brodsky asked mrs darrell nerv-
ously i dont see anybody
baron stared at her in wild in-
credulity and hope then his mind
went working backward ive got
a white elephant on my hands he
cried nobody will buy the place
its so out-of-the-way id take ten
thousand for it he cried hopelessly

  ill give you ten thousand for
it said the doctor

  a bargain when

  now he replied a verbal
agreement are you content
done answered baron then
brodsky took out the check he had
received and handed it to him baron
looked at it and his face turned
green he spun round on his heel
and left us and the fragments of the
paper descended in a cloud behind
us

  brodsky turned to mrs darrell
this is your home he said


weird tales

tut who was the spirit i asked
the doctor a few hours later
have you never played cha-
rades he asked what were the
names your little dahlia jim
the penman and chips the car-
penter   reverse the order and
what syllables do we obtain

     chip-pen-dale  i exclaimed with
sudden inspiration

  exactly said brodsky of
course it was not the famous maker
of chairs himself but the old gentle-
man who as mrs darrell told us
imagined himself to be chippendale
and talked in acrostics no doubt
the insult to his chair when it was
flung into the lot inspired him with
the desire to be revenged  

  but surely he would not still be
insane after a hundred years of
spirit life  i said   that offers up
rather hopeless chances for those of
us who die deranged in mind  
only when he returned to this
earth sphere replied the doctor
then he would naturally take on
characteristics which he possessed on
leaving it but a hundred years is
an unusually long period for a spirit
to manifest itself upon this earth
and i think it is highly probable
that now that the darrells are re-
stored to their own home he will
pass on to higher spheres and cease to
revisit us

 the figures registered vividly in his
 brain they seemed to swell mon
 strously to be about to topple over
 and crush him

the stairs creaked in dismal
protest as perry mounted the
last flight a musty odor
pervaded the air adding to his grow-
ing repugnance of the place he re-
called latimers esthetic inclinations
at college despite his queer bent even
then for certain mysterious chemical
experiments and he wondered at his
living in such quarters a shaft of
sunlight struggling through the
dirty skylight overhead threw the
finger smudges on the blank wall at
the top of the stairs into sharp relief
perry halted there in momentary be-
wilderment the oblong gallery
seemed at first glance to be devoid of
any doorway then he observed a
recess in the shadow at the other
end a few steps brought him before
a closed door in it

  his knock echoed eerily in the still-
ness of the hallway but without re-
sponse presently he rapped again
the door swung partly ajar reveal-
ing one end of a disorderly room a
curious singing sound like that of a
simmering teakettle was audible
unconsciously he rested his hand
against the door it gave noiselessly

swinging inward before he realized
what he was doing

  at a table by the window perry
saw the back of a man bent intently
over something before him a wisp
of yellowish vapor rose above the
silent worker mingling with a cloud-
like haze that hung low in the stuffy
air of the room perry choked as it
got into his lungs the figure at the
table raised an unkempt head and
stared round at him

  i beg pardon perry began i

expected to find-

  something familiar about the hag-
gard countenance made him hesitate
was it-why yes it was latimer
the other had already recognized
him

  well well perry old fellow
what a surprize

  perry grasped his old chums hand
with a curious mingling of emotions
this was not the fastidious latimer
of old his clothes hung on him like
a scarecrows his once boyish face
was drawn and deeply lined strange
eyes peered out of shrunken sockets
-a little wildly perry thought an
uncomfortable feeling crept over

him the hand he held was limp and
moist and cold unlike a living thing

  just learned the other day that
you were located right here in my
own home town lat perry said
thought id drop in and see how
youre getting along

  his gaze rested on the amber solu-
tion bubbling in the crucible on the
table and wandered over the room
littered with the odd paraphernalia
of a chemist he wondered whether
there was any truth in the rumor
that this man had discovered a prac-
tical elixir of youth-and how best to
tell him the real reason for his visit
he became aware that latimer was
talking answering his query    
doing nicely working on high-ex-
plosive formula for the government
 blow gibraltar off map great

stuff-

but about this wonderful elixir
of yours perry interjected how
about your experiments with that
a strange look came into the over-
bright eyes of the emaciated chemist

  ah yes he said softly so
youve heard of that that elixir of
youth the fact is perry that i
have perfected it i lack only a
human subject to prove my theories
although i have already been able to
change the age at will so to speak
of guinea-pigs and mice

  and you are still looking for a
human subject for experiment
yes

  how would i do

  you

  me-quietly

  but man you have everything in
life that is good wealth health
social position and all besides you
are the last of the sutherlands you
would not be a proper subject for
experiment and you are not old
par from it about forty-arent
you-though you dont look that
forty-three but i am going to
try it lat you see before you your
first subject if you will take me i

will sign a complete release for you
to cover any-ah-emergencies

  jove i believe you are in earn-
est   

  your belief is correct

  the chemist s intense face lighted
strangely

  very well as you wish a sly
smile stole over his countenance i
suppose theres a girl concerned in
this   

  i dont mind telling you that
there is said perry thinking of
alice what an exquisite little thing
she was her lovely dark hair and
eyes perfect features and delightful
personality had captivated nearly
every eligible male in her set yet
until recently she had seemed to
favor him over all the others not-
withstanding the difference in their
ages-she was twenty though perry
might easily have passed for thirty-
two or three coming from a family
of those fortunate beings who seem
to mature very slowly in appearance
at least the change in alices atti-
tude had been coincident with the
return of dal arterburn handsome
and youthful after a two-year ab-
sence and now apparently she was
lost to perry lost because he could
no longer fire her youthful imagina-
tion

  when-when would you wish to
begin this-er-treatment latimer
broke into his reflections

 now



the weeks that followed were
fraught with excitement and sus-
pense of the most acute sort for per-
ry always in the background of his
consciousness lurked the specter of
dread a product of that universal
instinctive fear of things unknown
after that first visit to latimers
laboratory he had thrown himself in-
to the whirl of social activities with
an abandon that soon earned for him
the youth-maker



the sobriquet of the life of the
party all this while he continual-
ly received wondering comments
from all sides on his changing ap-
pearance if he continued the treat-
ment much longei the secret would
have to come out latimer had said
on perrys last visit a few days
previous that he was now approxi-
mately thirty years young and
advised slowing up the rate of re-
juvenation to say a couple of years
a month to avoid danger of passing
the age of twenty-five this was the
mark perry had set as his ideal

   of course in that case you could
grow older again at the regular rate
until you reached the desired age
again after which you could remain
at the same age physically for an in-
definite time by the proper treat-
ments latimer explained

  a sudden fear clutched at perrys
heart

  suppose something should hap-
pen to you unexpectedly what
then would i go on approaching
closer and closer to infancy until i
passed out into the unknown   
that is just what would happen
for the present rate of rejuvenation
has now been well established only
by somewhat drastic treatment can i
even alter that rate

  a curious mad glitter came into
the chemists eyes

  what an interesting experiment
that would be he murmured as to
himself one wonders what would
become of the soul when the body re-
turned to the age of zero-the abso-
lute nadir of the point of birth
dont lat you give me the
creeps

  the chemist seemed to shake him-
self out of a trance

  i beg your pardon perry dont
take my ravings too seriously

  but after perry had gone the
chemist stood a long while gazing
with unseeing eyes out of the window
he was thinking of what had hap-

pened once in the case of the guinea-
pigs

  what an experiment he repeat-
ed softly



october fourth that fateful date
arrived without the slightest
warning of the horror it was to bring
and the terrible dread which was to
stalk in its wake

   on this day alice had finally yield-
ed to perrys plea to accompany him
 a drive he called for her at 

o	clock it was a delightful fall day
the sunlight fell softly through an
almost imperceptible haze as they
glided over the road behind the sweet-
ly purring motor for the first time
in months perry felt absolutely at
peace

  something of his mood must have
communicated itself to alice for she
seemed to have returned for the
time to her self of the first days
when they began going together
despite the exotic rambling of his
imagination perry felt when he
looked at her sitting there quietly be-
side him that he might easily forego
the trip abroad he had planned for
with unlimited youth at his com-
mand and no encouragement from
alice he was tempted to have one
wild prolonged fling

   perry she said following a long
silence during which their souls had
seemed in perfectly peaceful and
mutual accord you seem so differ-
ent today  

  in this she simply voiced his own
thoughts of her he told her so

  i too feel different she ad-
mitted but you are different in
many ways you act more like your
former self today than you have for
months and yet you are strangely
changed since then she looked at
him critically

  you look younger-much young-
er she went on i cant just pick


weird

tales

out the actual changes but you were
a little thin and were becoming tired-
looking at times you appeared to
have lost interest in things to be be-
coming prematurely settled-if you
know what i mean

  he nodded dull and uninterest-
ing like an old man was what she
meant

  but now your face is filled out
you evince a keen interest in every-
thing your eyes seem brighter and
clearer and you are not a bit set-
tled any more-or my observation of
the last month or so have been all
wrong i really dont see how you
keep up such a pace

  almost he obeyed an impulse to
tell her everything the temptation
-or the opportunity-passed how-
ever he couldnt bring himself to
do it foolish of him to have con-
sidered it he decided wouldnt do
at all to let the secret out everyone
would know it a day afterward

  i am glad you like the change
alice he said i would rather
please you than anyone else  

  he suddenly realized that this was
the truth

  more than irma chadwick
irma chadwick was the ravishing
blond who had recently dazzled the
men of their set on a prolonged visit
from philadelphia perry and she
had been much together while alice
and dal were pairing up at the vari-
ous social functions and driving
about and playing golf together con-
tinually

  much more then some imp of
perversity made him add   provided
dal doesnt object

  a hurt look clouded the dreamy
hazel eyes her lashes dropped and
she turned her head away from him

  already sorry for the note of dis-
cord he had allowed to escape from
him in that unfortunate moment of
selfishness perry stole miserable
glances at her between his watchful-
ness of the unwinding ribbon of road

why couldnt he have been satisfied
when matters were going smoothly
the realization came to him that all
he had done during the past six
weeks had been for her

  he was about to venture something
conciliatory when a car stalled in
the road ahead forced him to throw
on his brakes

  can i help perry called out
pulling up on the roadside just be-
yond the other car

  thanks maybe you can hope-
fully smiled the young chap who had
been tinkering about the car i
think im out of gas

  a quantity of gasoline was soon
drained from perrys tank and put
into the tank of the stalled car a
moment later the unfortunate motor-
ists guess was confirmed as his mo-
tor began to roar he drove away
voicing profuse thanks

  i think wed better turn round
and start back alice suggested

  but arent we going to have din-
ner somewhere together alice
cant i have another engage-
ment perry

  he pondered gloomily

  im mighty disappointed alice

is-is it because- im very

sorry i made that remark about dal
wont you forgive me

  that had nothing to do with it
-coolly i simply have- an en-
gagement

 then will you let me see you
some other evening this week you
know alice you have been pretty
hard on me for the last few months
even as he spoke he realized that
he had again said the wrong thing
he cursed himself inwardly for a
bungling fool

  you did not seem to be taking it
hard however there was always the
convenient dal excuse-as you have
already reminded me this after-
noon

  he wanted to tell her that he had
not understood that he had really
the youth-maker



preferred her all the time that he
thought she was acting just a bit
unfairly but she would not hear
him

  you neednt stammer excuses
perry she said you are mis-
taken in the presumption that any
are required please take me home
its growing late

  the trip back was made mostly in
silence broken only by occasional
brief remarks on purely superficial
subjects

  on the way home after leaving
alice perry bought a newspaper
he tucked it between the folds of the
upholstering at the end of the road-
sters seat not until he reached his
room did he open it

  a scare heading riveted his
gaze he stared at it a moment in
growing alarm

mad chemist blown to fkag-
ments

  fearfully he read

   a terrific explosion shook the entire low-
er section of the north side this afternoon
at  breaking many windows in the
vicinity of  perkins avenue a boarding
house in which the explosion occurred the
upper part of the house was wreeked im-
mediately bursting into flames whieh total-
ly destroyed the building before firemen
could check them all inmates of the house
escaped exeept john latimer a chemist
who occupied the attic the terrific ex-
plosion in his laboratory evidently killed
him outright as his features were hor-
ribly disfigured it is said that latimer
had been working on a high explosive for-
mula under the hallucination that his ser-
vices were retained by the government

  john latimer dead the terrible
significance of that catastrophe sank
into perrys consciousness like a
white-hot iron with latimer gone
he was doomed-doomed to a fate of
unprecedented horror more dreadful
than ordinary death or even torture
his vivid imagination magnified a
hundred times his fears of the month
past he recalled the bizarre char-
acterization of dr jekyll and mr
hyde and haggaids she in the

novels of those titles neither of which
could quite equal the horror of his
own predicament although he re-
flected there was a suggestion of
similarity between his case and an
incident portrayed in the latter of
these wild tales

  in an agony of remorse perry
realized that he could not again con-
sider marrying-even if alice would
have him for utterly ridiculous as
it may sound within another month
he would have reverted to the adoles-
cence of a fifteen-year-old in phys-
ique and appearance he would be just
that old though latimer had told
him that mentally he would remain
the same and he must expect the
end some three months later retain-
ing his mentality till the last



fob pure irony the fates win
hands down in a walk the ele-
gant all-wool crocheted drinking
cup at  oclock on the morning
of the fifth alice telephoned perry
to tell him that she knew shed been
horrid the previous afternoon that
shed had a horrid time during the
evening and that she wished hed
play tennis with her that morning

  he made some excuse or other for
he felt that he ought not to see her
again though his heart was yearning
for her tlie wisdom of this decision
was clear in the light of his hurried
visit the evening before to dr ab-
bott and its termination the emi-
nent nerve specialist had listened to
his tale with surprizing credulity
considering the grotesque nature of
it

  mr sutherland he said i
have been observing your case unbe-
known to you as you know i am a
fellow member of your atalanta
club where i see you occasionally
though i have not had the pleasure
of knowing you personally my
interest was first aroused through a


weird

tales

mutual acquaintance a while back
who remarked on the spectacular
change in you

  i perceive that there has been a
most unusual change in you even
since then this change probably is
less apparent to your close friends
who see you daily than to me be-
cause they see its gradual workings
while i get the full effect of the
gaps

  you believe then that there is
little doubt that i actually am re-
turning to infancy perry queried
his last hope slipping from him

  	 i am inclined to believe so some
years ago word of this man latimers
experiments got around among mem-
bers of the profession and i was con-
siderably impressed i have long
suspected that there was some means
of arresting the march of age and
that it was but a short step farther to
extending the process to pushing ago
backward your case confirms this
very interesting indeed very
very interesting to you doctor
no doubt but intensely inconvenient
to me what i want to know quick-
ly is how to halt the action of this
substance or fungus or whatever it
is that my body has been treated
with before it is too late what can
you do

  nothing i am very very sorry
sutherland  

  nothing surely science that
can produce an elixir to combat age
can also produce a chemical to kill
it

  exactly my dear sir you state
the situation exactly when you say
that the way to combat it is to kill
it but unfortunately it was found
in latimers experiments that to kill
the action of the elixir it was neces-
sary to kill the patient also because
the fungus had become an integral
part of the living organism

  in other words i have the choice
of suicide or this ignominious
death

  i am afraid that is correct of
course there is the long chance that
through further experiments some
other counteracting agent may be dis-
covered which will make a cure pos-
sible however that would require
time and time is fatal to you
will you undertake to direct such
research with all haste perry
asked naturally i am willing to
devote as much of my present liberal
resources as necessary to accomplish
the feat

  gladly i shall call together the
best minds of the profession this
case will attract world-wide atten-
tion you may be assured of its re-
ceiving the undivided attention of ex-
perts but i will not misrepresent
the outlook to you in a serious matter
like this there is scant chance of
success

  thank you for your frankness
said perry   there is one other
thing i wish to ask of you however
bind these men to secrecy until the
case is concluded



collowed fleeting days of alter-
nating hope and despair filled
with intense mental anguish what-
ever doubt there may have been about
his actually growing younger was dis-
pelled from perrys mind well before
the end of the month already his
beard was becoming noticeably less
wiry and he found it unnecessary to
shave as frequently as before sure-
ly and swiftly he was returning to
adolescence

  dr abbott had advocated first go-
ing to brussels where ressnier the
famed belgian specialist could be
consulted thither they journeyed
accordingly a brief stay there prov-
ing fruitless they went on to berlin
thence to vienna and finally to
paris corps of teuton specialists
had been intensely interested in per-
rys case most of them holding out
the youth-maker



hope for him but none was able to
definitely check the relentless action
of the mysterious elixir during the
patients stay several followed to
paris there to continue their ob-
servation of the strange case dr
abbott had advised remaining at
paris indefinitely in order that an
uninterrupted study of perrys case
could be made only a forlorn hope
that one of the various european ex-
perts might be able to prescribe a
positive cure and the drastic march
of time had caused abbott to ad-
vise the rapid moves

  the end of october saw perry and
the now-devoted abbott as father
and son when walking along the
boulevards of paris perry had been
obliged to purchase an entirely new
outfit of clothing as his stature had
shrunk considerably his health con-
tinued good and his mentality re-
mained that of a matured man his
memory was unimpaired resigned
to his fate he had ceased dwelling
upon it he waited with astonishing
calmness for the end

  not since leaving america had
perry written to alice

  from this time on his clothes be-
came a real problem plainly it was
useless to attempt to maintain a com-
plete wardrobe for no sooner had
he bought a garment than it began
growing too large for him he was
kept busy buying clothes to fit him
boys clothes it became a sort of
game to perry who welcomed it as
a diversion to help keep his mind off
his fate

  experts continued theorizing and
prescribing through monsieur thur-
bin in whose hands dr abbott had
finally placed perrys case the twoof
them however continuing to collabo-
rate with the best of the others study-
ing it the apparent partial check-
ing of the elixirs action had given
them renewed hope but as time
slipped by without further success

it became evident that the fateful
race between practical science and
the diabolical work of the departed
chemist would be lost in the end

christmas saw perry in pina-
fores no longer was he able to
procure his own clothing abbott now
looking after everything a month
before perry had made his last will
after a thorough examination by
alienists and in the company of two
prominent jurists to attest his san-
ity in order that there should after-
ward be no contesj over the legality
of the testament

  obviously it was not possible to
keep private the facts of so remark-
able a case thus long the news had
leaked out and newspapers and
magazines in nearly every corner of
the globe were crying with all the
particulars of this perry was quite
aware he shrank from public ap-
pearances because of the public curi-
osity he aroused on these occasions
he had had abbott rent a small but
beautiful chateau on the outskirts of
paris here perry intended spend-
ing the rest of his few remaining
days

  he had remembered each of his old
friends in the usual manner for
christmas directing abbott to select
and dispatch the different gifts to
alice he had sent a valuable brooch
in the shape of a delicately formed
racket of platinum with a small
diamond in the end of the tiny
handle of course she already knew
of the terrible fate hanging over his
head

  christmas morning arrived amid
the chiming of the great bells in the
cathedral near by where perry had
once attended services on a former
visit to paris years ago a number
of americans from adjacent quarters
of paris usually attended this place
of worship which had become a sort
of american shrine on this morn-


weird tales

ing in his little bed for the first time
since his affliction perry buried his
head in his arms and sobbed as if his
very heart would break it was thus
abbott found him

  buck up old man he said pat-
ting him on the back

 that old man and its in-
congruity brought him out of it he
dug the tears out of his eyes with his
chubby fists and essayed a laugh in
which there was a hint of hysteria 

  a letter for you perry said
abbott holding out a squarish gray
envelope

  with a start perry recognized the
peculiar rounded style of handwrit-
ing the postmark showed the mis-
sive to be from home alice he
tore it open feverishly cutting his
soft fingers in his haste

  only she perry decided as he read
could know the painstaking taste and
understanding that had sponsored
the penning of that letter

perry dear-

  an old friend understands and feels for
you if only i might help you too most
of all i am glad when i read of the way
you are bearing up that is like you i
admire you tremendously for it and
when i think that i may have been an in-
fluence in the step you made i feel re-
sponsible in a way for your predicament
if i was i am oh so sorry at the risk
of hurting more i want to tell you while
i can-for i must-that i loved you any-
way as you were but i did not realize
it fully until the damage was done i al-
ways shall love you perry

  there seems so little i can say yet i
want to cheer in some way this christmas-
tide my heart is with you will be with
you christmas day and always dear think
of me too then wont you -please 

  and be brave your

                            alice

  your-alice ah if he had only
known in time that she did care
well of such things is the pattern of
life what was done was done he
had not much longer to wait and
now he had her letter to read over
and over to keep and treasure to the

last that would help he wished
he might see her when she received
his own little remembrance

  new year s came and passed on
dr abbott stayed beside perry now
constantly counting the days it
was one of perrys last requests that
all the specialists who had lately been
in attendance upon him be permitted
to be present at the end he wanted
them to be able to study every phase
of his unearthly malady and to
broadcast to the world the terrible
folly of tampering with gods handi-
work that thought offered to him
a measure of consolation-at least he
was supplying a needed and dramatic
warning to mankind

  january twelfth that memorable
day was stamped upon perrys brain
with the fat black digits on the one-
day calendar pad that abbott had
hung on the wall directly opposite the
bed in his room for the last two
days perry had seen as in a dream
a ring of faces about him-the spe-
ialists watchful and expectant of the
the finish now imminent almost they
seemed eager for its arrival so avid
was their interest and always over
their shoulders perry saw the fat
prominent figures on the calendar
that were torn off each day

  only in the last few days had his
hitherto keen mentality suffered he
still retained his mature mind but
the awful nearness of the end-
whether through physical or mental
stress-had finally affected his con-
sciousness he seemed to be exist-
ing in a kind of hazy fairyland
there were times when he lay for
hours in a stupor for he had grown
quite weak still when dr abbott
would lean over to talk with him his
mind would clear temporarily and
he eould answer the questions put to
him

  on the last occasion when his
friend questioned him however in-
quiring briefly as to his comfort
and sensations perry had felt a sud-
the youth-maker



den nausea as he tried to reply one
of the specialists took the calendar
off the wall and held it close before
perrys eyes as from a great dis-
tance he heard a voice asking whether
he could read the date the figures
registered vividly in his brain they
seemed to swell monstrously to be
about to topple over and crush him
he tried to raise his puny arms to
ward off the blow but he could not
move an enormous weight seemed
to be pressing upon him all over
his head felt as if it were gripped in
rapidly shrinking bands of iron he
was conscious of a sinking feeling
and a drawing sensation as if his
whole body were suddenly shrunken
into a very small bundle-a point a
speck in infinity   

  a bruptly he found himself gasp-
ing for air was he to have a
brief respite then suddenly he
realized that his hands were free-he
could move he clutched at  his
body and encountered-not a ball of
shriveled flesh but a body of normal
proportions with an effort he
opened his eyes

  gone was the ring of doctors the
threatening calendar dr abbott
was standing before him then he
observed that he was sitting in the
doctors reception room apparently
he had fallen asleep in the comfort-
able morris chair while waiting for
the doctor

  well you seemed to be having a
right eventful dream laughed dr
abbott i found you lying back
quivering and trying to talk and
looking as if you were experiencing a
perfectly good nightmare ill bet
youve been giving your stomach the
worst of things

  im afraid i have perry ad-
mitted

    and trying to do with about half
the sleep you should have its be-
ginning to show on you 

  guilty again doctor

  then at the others request he ex-
amined his case the physician
listened gravely enough albeit with
evident skepticism when perry had
finished he shook his finger at his
patient in the brusk but friendly
manner that was characteristic of
him

  young man he said youve
been fed up on the rankest twaddle
that it ever has been my privilege to
listen to im surprized that you
gave it credence seekers of youth
did not pass out with ponce de leon
as all well knew but this is the first
time ive heard of anyone claiming
to know how to grow younger-much
less to want to know how to cease
growing younger

  but how do you account for the
abnormal change in my appear-
ance

  abnormal-bosh just the natu-
ral result of being yourself youd
been moping around and fossilizing
until you woke up and gave your
mind a chance to enjoy itself you
needed recreation even at the ex-
pense of rest though now its time
to slow up a bit and use some judg-
ment in your daily program try to
get at least six hours of sleep seven
or eight would be better you are
simply one of those fortunate fellows
who dont age as fast as the average
and you look now about as you should
look if you think you look as if
youve just cast your first vote your
vanity needs a jolt however you
dont look older than lots of fellows
do at thirty now youd better let
me examine you to make sure that 
that madman hasnt poisoned you
with his so-called treatments

  thirty minutes later perry bound-
ed down dr abbotts front steps
with a heart that felt at least ten
years younger than when he had
climbed them he drove hoihe with
his head full of plans for the imme-
diate future fortunately the pre-
liminary examination had shown no


weird tales

ill effects from the treatments he had
permitted latimer to give him the
blood tests abbott was conducting
would settle this question finally

  one thing puzzled perry consider-
ably at first how had he visualized
dr abbott accurately in a dream
when he had never seen him before
then he recalled that he had seen
him once several months back on the
occasion of the specialists making an
address at a luncheon as a guest of
the lions club

  on the heels of this reflection per-
ry remembered the letter from alice
that he had dreamed about certain
words had stuck in his mind vividly
 i want to tell you  that i loved
you anyway as you were i did not
realize it   until the damage was
done suppose she had said those
things maybe as the dream letter
had suggested he had not made the
most of things as they were he de-
termined to see alice that very next
morning-and he would not wait to
see whether she would telephone him
as she had in his dream



derby obtained alices consent to
a play tennis with him the next
morning and he let her conquer him

in the first and only set after that
they went driving

  he drew the car up on a quiet
stretch of road where there was
a magnificent view of the winding
river the red-and-gold hills rose
beyond it in imposing grandeur and
their magnificence with the feathery
cloudlets above was reflected in the
unruffled surface of the water a
sense of great peace seemed to settle
over the scene and them

  alice perry said i want you
dear ive wanted you ever since i
first met you and by george he
enthused as she looked at him en-
couragingly im going to have
you 

  he took her in his arms as he had
so often longed to do and kissed her
she did not resist more she slipped
an ym round his neck and pulled
him close as she kissed him back

  oh perry why didnt you do
that yesterday she asked present-
ly

  wha-whats the matter dear
he queried in alarm was she going
to tell him she had since become en-
gaged to someone else

  nothing only-only i thought
you were going to-and-you didnt
thats why i got angry

slowly the head came back
to the left until the eyes were
fixed upon the ghastly coun-
tenance of kupfer

the spectacles lay on the
table between the two men
and for a time neither spoke
each was busy with his thoughts
winthrop the younger gazed at the
glasses with eager curiosity not un-
mixed with awe for dr ransome
had just been telling him strange
things about them and his journal-
istic instinct was fired here was a
story with a vengeance    magic
glasses 

  the spectacles were certainly un-
common the frame of solid gold
was of unusual design heavy and
strong the metal encircling the lens-
es after the old style the bars that
clasped the sides of the wearers head
were bowed slightly to give a spring
effect and after a still older fashion
were hinged in the middle so that
they could be folded up very com-
pactly beyond being rather dark in
tint there did not seem to be anything
to distinguish the lenses from ordin-
ary   smoked   glasses - excepting

m

perhaps their thickness they were
very heavy

  the case lay near dr ransomes
elbow it also was of antique de-
sign and was quite a work of art it
was of light strong wood covered
with red morocco leather and was in
two pieces the main body and a slid-
ing end which was removed com-
pletely when one inserted or with-
drew the glasses after the manner of
the old-fashioned razor cases ex-
tending for about two-thirds of the
length of the case proper there was
clamped to one of its sides a kind of
ivory tablet secured in place by little
gold rivets this tablet was inlaid
with representations of fruits and
flowers of remarkable perfection in
form coloring and artistic arrange-
ment betraying at once its oriental
origin

  as i was explaining said dr
ransome the mandarin brought tho
rock crystals over personally from
canton to jena in germany having

                                   


weird tales

heard of the fame of the optical
workers there i think i am right in
saying that the crystals were spheri-
cal and had been used for crystal-
gazing where they were actually
mined i never heard the mandarin
although a high and important digni-
tary in his own country traveled to
europe without ostentation for it
was ordained that it should be done
so and proceeded to jena where he
behaved rather singularly instead
of going to the opticalcompanies he
went among the workers themselves
and by dint of persuasion and bribes
ascertained that one carl werther
an elderly swiss and a single man
was the cleverest and most accurate
grinder in the district then he
sought out werthers employers and
for a handsome payment obtained
their permission to let him have the
services of the swiss on this particu-
lar job until it was finished he
would have taken werther back with
him to do the work in china but it
had been prophesied that it would be
done in the west and no true china-
man would dream of disputing any-
thing so sacred however he stipu-
lated that he personally must be
present during all the operations
that the unfinished work should be
given to his care each night that all
particles of the ground crystals be
gathered up and restored to him and
that no one should look through the
finished glasses in short he made
himself a horrible nuisance to the
optical people but as he was willing
to pay any price they humored him
and so he had his way

 didnt want anyone to see
through the glasses eh asked win-
throp with interest

  no said ransome he was
insistent on that point but in that
connection it is rather curious to note
that the swiss werther developed
some lung trouble not long after the
mandarin had gone back east and
this soon carried him off on his

death bed he confessed to the parish
priest that he had disfbeyed the
mandarins injunctions and had con-
trived to pilfer a piece of the precious
crystal out of which he had fashioned
for himself a monocle the deed
seemed to have troubled his con-
science-in fact it was stated he had
been a changed man since working on
that particular job at his own re-
quest the monocle was buried with
him  

  winthrop picked the spectacles up
and unfolded them

  may i he asked with an en-
quiring look at dr ransome

   certainly said the doctor heart-
ily i brought them out for that
purpose

  winthrop adjusted the heavy
frame to his face with difficulty and
blinked around the room

  i dont see anything special he
said in disappointed tones   every-
thing is darker than usual-thats
all

  he took the glasses off and looked
at the doctor half reproachfully
and yet you say some people can
see wonderful things through them

  dr ransome nodded

  try again he said

  the young reporter again fixed the
glasses in position and looked around
he stared out of the window for a
few seconds and then on turning his
head sharply toward where dr ran-
some was seated he gave a start and
an exclamation

  gee he said that was curi-
ous

  he remained staring

  what was it asked dr ran-
some smiling slightly

  as i turned round toward you
there said winthrop instead of
yourself sitting in the chair in every-
day american clothes there was seat-
ed a chinese gentleman in yellow
robes ornamented with black dragons
-i saw the dragons distinctly-and
with some kind of a hat or skull-cap
windows op destiny



on his head the face and figure
were yours-beard and all-but you
had become a chinaman then in a
flash you were yourself again

  he took the glasses off once more
and examined them intently

  i am glad you saw something
after all said dr ransome his
plump cheerful face wearing an air
of relief it is a good sign and
what you saw was not so very ridicu-
lous as might be supposed for
there is a certain amount of chinese
blood in my veins as your father
may have told you my maternal
grandmother was a full-blooded chi-
nese lady when i was working on
the staff of the new asia in hong-
kong by virtue of my chinese an-
cestor i was admitted to membership
in a powerful chinese society and
on state occasions we wore such robes
as you have described all this how-
ever is between ourselves

  his keen blue eyes held those of
his companion for a moment

  certainly replied winthrop
  but you are not going to do me out
of my stoiy i hope

  there will be no story out of
these glasses if you please   said dr
ransome firmly and impressively
and then seeing the disappointment
on winthrops features he added
kindly but i will give you plenty
of other stories harry never fear

  the young man thanked him grate-
fully to have been sent for by the
most noted traveler and coirespond-
ent of his day and not get anything
out of him would he felt have been
nothing short of a calamity

the glasses are famous through-
out the east where they are
known as the windows of destiny
continued dr ransome worn bv
an honest and earnest student and
one who loves his fellows they will re-
veal the true nature of those on whom
he turns his gaze to those whose

hearts are evil other sights may be
revealed but the flippant the sacri-
legious and the unbelieving can ac-
complish nothing at all with them
the glasses were stolen from a tem-
ple in pekin during the boxer rebel-
lion i was there at the time and
were found by a servant of mine on
the body of a dead bandit he
brought them to me i turned them
over to the society of which i spoke
which numbers the best and most in-
fluential men in china among its
members and they commissioned me
to perform a certain service with
them in this country but the glass-
es will ultimately go back to china
no matter whether i take them there
or not if they are in existence at all
they will be recovered and taken
there  

  they are liable to be stolen of
course said winthrop keenly inter-
ested

  they are said dr ransome
although not altogether on account
of their intrinsic value there are
many sects and secret societies in
china that would give anything to
have them-plotters and malevolent
peisons several lives have been
lost over them already and there is
even danger in having them about
one-although not so much in this
country  

  how curious and interesting
said winthrop drinking in every
word

  rather said dr ransome sober-
ly and serious at the same time
for this is their theory of the pur-
pose of the glasses the windows of
destiny are to reveal to a great
leader the manner in which to over-
come the evils of mankind and he is
to open the eyes of the world to the
true way out of the slough of hatred
and enmity into which the peoples
of the earth have fallen their faith
in this is sublime and their dream is
that one of their race is to be the one
chosen for the work


weird tales

  yes said winthrop tensely

  it is easy to speak of these things
in a matter-of-fact way and to sum-
marize them   said dr ransome
gravely but no words of mine
could convey the faintest notion of
the patient labor and care and love
and devotion through long periods of
time that finally resulted in the
formulating of these theories-a
formulation that might make many
of our scientists blush but it has
finally been worked out to this these
people believe that somewhere in the
world today there is what they call
an imp of discord-one man in par-
ticular who is making it his business
to create strife and discord now i
presume you know your history well
enough to be aware of the mischief
that one man or a few men can work
-the case of cassar is a good enough
illustration you know how he re-
peatedly pardoned the handful of
enemies who spent their lives balk-
ing him and who finally brought
about his death and the disruption
of the empire very well there
are in the world today a certain
number of men whose business it is
to create strife for their own person-
al ends the chinese believe that
there is a kind of arch-chief who
consciously or unconsciously affects
the others-a kind of ringleader as it
were according to their calcula-
tions he is to be found in this coun-
try and i have been commissioned
to find him

  and can i be of assistance to
you asked winthrop his counten-
ance betraying eagerness

  you can said dr ransome de-
cisively i have chosen you for the
work to get the best results from
the glasses it is essential to have good
and true eyesight now i am af-
flicted with a certain type of myopia
whieh virtually prevents my using
them at all but you have good eye-
sight and that is the first considera-
tion secondly your father was one

of my dearest friends and last but
not least i have made enquiries
about you and find you to be pos-
sessed of considerable discretion
winthrop blushed as he bowed his
thanks this was indeed praise from
a high quarter

 i have consequently arranged
with your employers continued
dr ransome that for the next
month you will be at my disposal
with your newspaper affiliations and
letters i shall give you you will be
able to get access to certain public
men with whose names i shall fur-
nish you some are financiers some
senators some judges some manufac-
turers all you will be called on to
do will be to get an interview with
each of these men and survey them
one and all through the glasses you
will report your findings to me here
a month hence you can get in
touch with me in the interval if need
be at the press club in new york
this is thursday you may reckon
your month as commencing on next
monday the thirteenth if you will
call here on saturday forenoon at

	oclock i will give you all the
papers you need and also the glass-
es whieh meantime i am going to
have taken from this old-fashioned
frame and fitted into a more modem
one-i think a horn frame will be
the most suitable

  dr ransome smiled and waved his
hand signifying that the interview
was at an end and winthrop took
his departure

co great was the young reporters
 excitement that he could scarcely
sleep that night and he counted the
hours as they passed to think that
he should be selected for such a task
-a task the like of whieh had never
been heard of and whieh might in-
volve all sorts of extraordinary ad-
ventures  he was in a fever of an-
ticipation till the fateful saturday
forenoon wore slowly round and
windows of destiny



punctually at  oclock he was
at dr ransomes room in the hotel
true to his promise the doctor had
had the dark lenses taken from the
heavy gold mounting and they were
now framed in common bone the
magnificent case too had disap-
peared and the spectacles were en-
closed in one of polished aluminum
this the doctor handed to winthrop
shortly after his entrance together
with papers and letters of introduc-
tion

  take the names in the order in
which you find them in the list he
said it is true this involves going
back and forth from one town to an-
other but never mind there is a
reason for that particular order and
first of all you had better wear the
glasses for a day or two at intervals
that is and not all the time and get
accustomed to their peculiarities
they take a little understanding be
here a month from monday with
your report should anything very
startling happen before then you can
communicate with me as directed

  he shook hands with the young
man and turned to his correspond-
ence

  winthrops experiences before
interviewing the first of his men
may perhaps be best described by
quoting from the report which he
ultimately made to dr ransome

  i found at first that the glasses
tended to give me a headache and
even to cause a eertain amount of
dizziness i could not wear them for
more than about fifteen minutes at
one time during the first day but
was able to increase this with each
succeeding day until finally i could
wear them as long as two hours at a
stretch my experiences on the first
day saturday the eleventh were so
extraordinary that i was rendered
rather nervous and excited and went
slightly easier on the next day by
the third day the breaking in was
complete

  i began by viewing people on the
public thoroughfares and in the
street cars and subways many
of these appeared ridiculously small
as if viewed through the wrong end
of a telescope these i assumed to
be small people-unimportant hum-
bugs their number was distressing-
ly and depressingly large as sure
as i turned the glasses on some well-
dressed impressive prosperous-look-
ing person whom one would have
supposed to be of some importance
just so surely would he dwindle
away it would have been laughable
had it not been rather sad on ac-
count of its commonness goodness
seemed almost invariably to be found
in inverse ratio to worldly circum-
stances-you got better results among
the poor people

    ordinary everyday workpeople
showed up well that is to say they
appeared very largely to be their
normal selves which i took to be a
healthy sign some of them assumed
quite a beatific appearance and every
now and again one would be discov-
ered with a perfect aura or halo sur-
rounding him or her almost in-
variably these were either artizans or
simple office workers

  one case in particular that quite
stunned me was that of old joe les-
lie who runs the little candy store
near the university there was such
a light shining around this old mans
head that one could hardly look at
him and yet when the glasses were
removed it was just old joe smiling
at you i felt inclined to go down
on my knees i have known for a
long time that joe was a good old
scout and i received kindnesses at
his hands myself when at college
but now i think he must be a posi-
tive angel i felt impelled to speak
to him of those old days and to thank
him again but he could not remem-
ber having done anything in par-
ticular he said when i insisted he
laughed and told me to forget it


weird tales

  then i had an idea and told him
to try on the glasses he did so and
exclaimed almost at once on how
bright everything and everybody
looked he went to the shop door
and looked down the street and he
kept remarking all the time on the
brightness and how beautiful every-
body looked he wanted to know
where he could buy such glasses i
felt slightly ashamed to think that i
should have seen most folks look the
other way-that is at their worst

 wicked people of whom there
seem to be a great many presented
all sorts of appearances-mean fur-
tive hypocritical ferocious and a
few awful beyond description these
were chiefly in high places and it
used to scare me sometimes to see
what power they had many of them
seemed to move through a range of
emotions according as their moods
varied from merely unpleasant to
actually dreadful just as the good
varied from mildly good to beautiful
even the small sometimes tended to
grow larger but the bad were al-
ways bad and the good never so

  i was greatly interested in what
i saw in the churches which proved
the most fascinating study the
ministers measured up poorly most
of them being small an extra good
type was found in a small denomina-
tional chapel down in the east end
the pastor of which an old man was
said to be emptying his church it
was admitted however that he did
good work among the poor it may
perhaps have been significant here
that the radiance which emanated
from the person of this fine-looking
old gentleman seemed to find a reflec-
tion in the countenances of nearly all
of the limited number of worshipers
who attended on the morning of my
visit and who seemed to be largely
old women the whole interior of
the building was resplendent and the
worshipers seemed to laugh at one
another with their eyes in a way that

was very beautiful and made one feel
happy i felt refreshed after attend-
ing this service

  the average congregation seemed
to contain an unpleasantly large
number of the crafty and cunning
and even of the cruel the types
could all be easily distinguished the
pastor of one fashionable church pre-
sented a truly demoniacal appearance
and positively filled me with terror
yet his sermon was clever and
created much merriment and even
applause but just as in the old
mans church the radiance spread
so here did the evil-or rather this
man had gathered evil ones about
him here and there could be seen
the white radiance shining generally
around some old head but the gen-
eral aspect of this church was dark
and terrifying a look of malevolent
understanding seemed to sweep like
wind on a field of com across the up-
turned countenances as some clever
point was made yet it was a
wealthy and upper class congrega-
tion

  the business section showed up
very badly-worst of all with the
possible exception of the town cor-
poration heads of businesses man-
agers partners directors and officials
of big companies were generally of
the cunning and unscrupulous type
although here and there there were
curious streaks of decency very
often among the younger men and
every now and again some splendid
specimen it is interesting to note
that most of the men in this field
who showed up well had good solid
reputations i did not find a single
case of a fine man who was not
known to be fine a curious thing
was that some of the very biggest
magnates appeared quite small while
their lieutenants and right-hand men
would be shockingly bad-indicating
i take it that the great man was sim-
ply rather a harmless person who
was being worked upon by scoun-
windows of destiny



drels bankers as a class showed up
well lawyers the reverse

  the city council as a body made
the poorest showing with deceit and
dishonesty the order of the day plus
a certain amount of desperate vil-
lainy but we have a good mayor
it was worth something to see him
sitting there illuminating the whole
chamber with his line honest benevo-
lent countenance as i sat at the re-
porters  table a prominent member
of the council came behind the
mayors chair he was supposed to be
one of the mayors strongest support-
ers and bending over whispered in
his ear for sheer malignity i never
saw anything approaching this mans
face as viewed through the glasses
the mayor frowned and dissented
and the look on the councilors face
became so diabolical that i took off
the glasses in alarm expecting to see
him seize the mayor by the throat
but he was just standing there smil-
ing-only it was a smile that i now
understand thoroughly  

  a bout the middle of the first week
-f- of the term of inquiry winthrop
interviewed the first of the men on
his list which contained in all twelve
names that were household words all
over the country left to himself
winthrop could scarcely have hoped
to gain admittance to all of them but
dr ransome was also working in his
behalf and barriers were broken
down in a way that winthrop did not
always understand sometimes there
were delays and postponements and
of course time was lost by the order
of the names on the list which neces-
sitated starting out at washington
then journeying to new york then
back again to washington then to
chicago then to new york again
but he kept steadily at the task al-
though so far the results were dis-
appointing nothing very unusual
developed until he tackled his ninth
man a world-renowned financier at

the beginning of the last week of the
search immediately after seeing this
man he wired to dr ransome to
meet him at once and next day they
were together

  winthrop was pale and excited
and his eyes shone strangely the
work while not exactly difficult had
been arduous and nerve-trying and
had called for much discretion and
patience but this was not what
worried him it was what he had on
his mind

  i think we have got our man
doctor he exclaimed dramatically
after shaking hands at least if it
is a man at all

  he commenced to stride nervously
up and down the room

  dr ransome although calm and
unperturbed nevertheless manifested
real interest

  better sit down harry he said
drawing out a chair and leading the
excited young reporter to it we
must keep cool for we may have seri-
ous work to do tell me exactly what
you saw

  winthrop sat down and passed his
hand with a quick movement across
his forehead

  i can hardly believe it is true
he said it is like some horrible
nightmare i almost wish i hadnt
seen the sight

  yes said dr ransome quietly
taking a pencil and a pad of paper
from his pocket

   	 i was rather relieved if the truth
must be told began winthrop
that my men were showing up so
well they were mostly cunning and
tricky one or two of course were
really villainous but not more so
than other men in lower walks of life
i felt pretty secure about this finan-
cier he was so well known and so
famous i was sure he would figure
well i called as per appointment
and had a little chat with him before
i put the glasses on while i explained
to him about that asiatic develop-


weird tales

ment company and gave him the
prospectus and your letter while
he was busy with these i donned the
spectacles and turned my gaze on
him one look was enough i nearly
fell off my chair you will understand
the horror i felt and still feel when
i tell you that what i saw sitting be-
fore me in that office chair was a
thing like a monstrous rat

  all said dr ransome signif-
icantly   a rat 

 he made one deep and curious
character in the notebook with his
pencil and then shut the book and
put it back in his pocket

  you possibly know what the man
is like continued winthrop shud-
dering slightly a little thin man
with a narrow head and rather a
high bald forehead - everything
about him small small hands small
frame-and wears rather tight-fitting
clothes he changed right before my
eyes and there was a kind of great
rat decked out in clothes and sitting
at a desk reading a paper i tell you
the very hands became paws-i sat
spellbound watching them slowly
change his voice is a high-pitched
squeaking voice at the best of times
and when he raised his head and
squeaked at me my blood simply ran
cold i could only mumble some-
thing incoherent in reply so great
was my confusion tearing off the
glasses as  did so and there was
his normal self staring at me in as-
tonishment and doubtless thinking i
had taken a fit or something i made
excuses    blamed it on the heat
but i got away as quickly as pos-
sible i was afraid when he shook
hands with me at parting i nearly
yelled thinking i felt the touch of a
paw  

  winthrop hid his face for a mo-
ment quite overcome dr ransome
now pale and troubled came round
and patted him on the shoulder

  i know all i need to know now
he said gently you have done well

and will be well rewarded dont
speak of it any more  

  yes yes said winthrop with
nervous eagerness let me tell
everything it gives me relief it is
having the knowledge bottled up
within me that is harmful

  dr ransome resumed his seat

  i once went into a show in my
home town of portland maine when
i was a boy winthrop said after a
short silence to see something that
had been caught on a ship in the
harbor and was being exhibited as a
curiosity a nickel was charged for
admission it was a great monstrous
rat of some kind-i forget exactly
what they called it but i wished
afterward i had not looked at it at
all-it haunted me for days its head
and front paws were small-not so
very much bigger than those of an
ordinary rat but it increased alarm-
ingly toward the rear and had an
enormous pair of haunches the
brute weighed i think about forty
pounds as you entered the tent in
which its cage was housed you got a
hind view of the thing and it some-
how made me think of the shoulders
of a human being i remember it
gave me a kind of nausea at the time
well i experienced exactly the same
sensation when i got my first glimpse
of kupfer through the glasses he
was sitting side on to me and some-
how it was his shoulders that first as-
sumed the aspect of the hind quar-
ters of the brute 

  it must have been dreadful said
dr ransome sympathetically but
i must see it too-if i can it is part
of my duty  

  the little paws handling the pa-
pers said winthrop shuddering
again the head with the snout in

the air

  he stopped unable to continue
for some moments he struggled with
his emotions and then burst out
good god sir this is too hor-
rible  what on earth does it mean 
windows of destiny



  something like this as near as i
can figure said dr ransome sadly
the thing began with this mans
grandfather who made the family
fortune we will suppose him to have
been an ordinary type of man-per-
haps slightly more avaricious than
usual his son who succeeds him
extends and enlarges the business as
we know he did and makes it a
world-wide organization he possibly
is abnormally avaricious as we have
reason to believe he was now in the
process of two such lives unless great
care is exercised which it rarely is
the human element in the make-up of
the individual is apt to become flat-
tened out there are few who can
successfully carry the load of such
greatness or handle wisely and justly
the prodigious power entailed by the
possession of such fortunes for
auglit i know the grandfather of this
man may have been abnormal to be-
gin with the father was sometimes
called money-mad the son is ap-
parently a person whose soul is al-
most completely atrophied that i
take to be the meaning of the picture
revealed cunning reigns supreme
its symbol is the rat  

  do you mean that the man has
really lost his soul asked the hor-
ror-stricken reporter

  something like that said dr
ransome although it is a little
difficult to express by the use of a
word like soul if you knew a lit-
tle more about the religions of the
east you would grasp the signif-
icance more clearly the buddhists
for example do not believe in a soul
as we understand the term they
believe in a kind of collective some-
thing passing down from one life to
another the collective good or collec-
tive evil of the father coming down
to the son as it were-in other words
the starting of one life from the point
of development at which the last one
left off

    i think i understand-slightly at
any rate said winthrop

  now continued dr ransome
if you keep going backward from
what we might cail the goodness
point you will come presently to what
may be termed the zero line by
that i mean the character line to be
on the right side of which is still to
be able to distinguish between right
and wrong though the predomin-
ating tendency may be to do evil
but when you go below zero the dis-
tinction between good and evil is
lost-the person is no longer able to
discriminate between them

  really incapable of discrimin-
ating asked winthrop in horrified
fascination

  really incapable said dr ran-
some or in acute danger of becom-
ing so unless he can be resuscitated
by a tremendous mental shock of
some kind this man as you know
is a public character hardly a day
passes without his appearing some-
where or other and making a speech
you must have seen many of these
speeches and know how they are al-
ways bristling with expressions of
good will toward mankind in gen-
eral and the poor and needy in par-
ticular the man has been trained
that way he knows how to play up
to the crowd you will find him giv-
ing large sums to charities-his name
is on every list of any importance
he supports at least one church al-
most entirely by himself and yet if
you could just read his inmost heart
-hear him confess what he actually
thought-well you would then un-
derstand why he is symbolized by the
rat

  winthrop nodded

  i understand he said

  there were five evil things that
had to be located dr ransome
went on these were the rat sym-
bolical of malevolent cunning the
most feared and hated of all the ass
representing stupidity the gorilla


weird tales

typifying feroeity and hatred the
sheep indicating fear and the
snake symbolical of mischief one
of these the snake is in the east
two the ass and the gorilla are in
europe i had a hand in discovering
them  while this continent can claim
two the sheep whom i unearthed
very quickly and the rat whom
you have just discovered all are
great and powerful men wherein lies
the danger to mankind a secret
bond unites all of them in a way
they themselves do not dream of it
would be rather dreadful for the
world if they did it is to preelude
such dire possibility that we are
working  

  how extraordinary said win-
throp sitting so still that he scarcely
seemed to breathe   one can hardly
credit such things are there any
good ones equally powerful

  yes said dr ransome but
they must stay concealed from the
evil ones for a time great ones
they call them in the east-and they
are all located there it is somewhat
disappointing to confess but you
can imagine with what joy these de-
voted orientals set out on making
such discoveries-or rather you can
not imagine it for these people are
devoted beyond all our knowledge
but you may ponder my boy those
lines of shakespeares there are
more things in heaven and earth
horatio than are dreamt of in your
philosophy nothing more truly
significant was ever pronounced by a
european just think of the men
who are working in the east there
trying to save humanity from itself
some of them are monks walled up in
huts in tibet from which they never
emerge but working-working   
and we always think of these
people as barbarians said win-
throp with a rueful smile and think
we have a monopoly of workers in
human welfare

  just as they think of us as bar-

barians   said the doctor briskly
except that they are willing to ad-
mit our gain in things material-of
which of course they take little
stock  

  what is the next move in this
wonderful business asked win-
throp curiously

  we will go and see our man to-
morrow together said dr ran-
some pulling the telephone book to-
ward him and starting to turn over
the leaves i will call him up now
and make an appointment after
that i will send a cable to canton

  in a few seconds he had the num-
ber and the appointment was made

  ten-thirty tomorrow harry he
said come around here at 
oclock i must view him through
the glasses he is interested in that
commercial scheme i knew he would
be

xtext morning dr ransome and
his young co-worker set out on
foot for the offices of the magnate
the day was warm and glorious the
sun shone brilliantly and little old
new york looked its best the spar-
rows twittered and fussed and the
throngs rushed about their business-
keen eager hurrying winthrop
and dr ransome seemed the only
ones in sight whose conduct was
leisurely yet winthrop was looking
about him with new eyes and a dif-
ferent vision to his fancy it seemed
that he was helping in the shaping of
destiny-that he had been called to a
great task it struck him as rather
strange and indeed wounded his van-
ity somewhat to think that all this
change in his outlook could be
brought about by simply looking
through a particular pair of spec-
tacles of course there was dr ran-
some he glanced at the sedate little
figure by his side calm and un-
ruffled how had he reached such a
pinnacle of greatness and yet it
windows of destiny



was not necessary to ask if you
knew the man you knew the answer

  dr ransomes card was enough to
give them a preference among the
throng that waited in the great mans
anteroom and they were ushered into
his presence almost directly he was
as winthrop had described a little
thin wizened man with a high dome-
like forehead and a pair of ferretlike
pale blue eyes the room was plain-
ly and simply furnished with good
fumed-oak material and a rich green
carpet covered the floor it was a
typical office of its kind-the work-
ing-place of a modem commercial
man of action here was no litter of
papers and books or of baskets a
large square flat-topped desk stood
over near the window kupfer was
seated at one side before him was a
blotting pad and perhaps half a doz-
en open letters there were also two
ink bottles black and red a small
rack of pens and pencils and a bot-
tle of mucilage that was all

  welcome to our city ransome
said kupfer in his piping voice ris-
ing and shaking hands with the doc-
tor its years since i have seen
you been prowling around in the
interval i suppose keeping your
finger on the pulse of world affairs
eh

  he laughed at his own facetious-
ness at the same time motioning his
visitors to chairs

  yes said dr ransome rather
quietly seating himself i have
been doing a little of that amongst
other things

  he took the spectacle case from his
pocket and proceeded to don the
glasses

  you wear those dark glasses
too said kupfer who missed noth-
ing it seems to me i noticed your
young friend wore a pair yesterday
we all come to them sooner or later
im one of the lucky ones-ive es-
caped so far dont do any read-
ing or writing yourself if you can

help it a famous eye specialist ad-
vised me years ago make the other
fellow do it for you ha ha the
advice was sound i took it  

  dr ransome smiled in reply at
the same time surveying the financier
steadily through the glasses win-
throp watched him breathlessly al-
though he did not change counten-
ance or betray concern in any marked
fashion anyone who knew the vet-
eran journalist well could have told
that he was troubled chiefly by the
loss of his habitual quietude and
poise he made little restless move-
ments that were unusual to him and
looked away from kupfer from time
to time presently he took the glass-
es off and replaced them in their case

  you have looked over the propo-
sition he said

  yes said kupfer opening one
of the drawers of his desk and tak-
ing out the papers which winthrop
had left i am interested of course
the potentialities are tremendous i
am inclined to put in a couple of
millions myself-that is to raise it
in my own circle the granary idea
is very sound in view of the food con-
ditions over there the key of the
supply chest is the key of the house
is one of my maxims i have never
known it to fail

  in spite of himself winthrop could
scarcely repress a shudder

  can this state governor be trust-
ed asked kupfer after further ex-
amination of the papers

  absolutely said dr ransome
curtly any of the chinese whose
names are mentioned can however
things are developing rather quickly
over there and even since i left there
have been changes my latest advice
by cable this morning is that two of
their men are on their way over here
with further particulars you will
see them when they come i suppose
they will be here in about three
weeks but i can advise you definitely
later and make an appointment


weird tales

  certainly said the financier
ill be interested to hear the latest
news  

  he fixed his eyes on the doctor
you seem to have a way with those
fellows ransome he said half
enviously i remember how they
stuck by you in that southern china
proposition you didnt know i was
the power behind the whaley inter-
ests eh  but i was watching you all
the time and they certainly stayed
with you

  there was some further talk of a
business nature and the visitors rose

  breaking the youngster in are
you asked kupfer his little eyes
darting from one countenance to an-
other in a way that made winthrop
wonder uneasily if he could read
their thoughts cant begin too
young i was seven when i first lent
a fellow a dime and got back two of
his saturday nickels and a chunk of
candy ha ha you cant begin
too young ill wait your further
word doctor glad to have seen
you

  in a few moments they were in the
street again

  lets go and have some refresh-
ment harry said dr ransome
i feel slightly unwell after that ex-
perience i can well understand your
being upset he is our man sure
enough  

they adjourned to a cafe near by
and ordered drinks while dr
ransome pulled out his cigar case
and they both proceeded to light up

  are these men actually on the
way from china asked winthrop

  i sent off a cable yesterday after
you left me said dr ransome
and just got word before we set
out this morning that they had been
able to get passage at the last minute
on a c p r steamer for vancouver
i knew they wouldnt lose much time
until they arrive however we can

do nothing but wait you can go
back to your reporting meantime
harry and i will send for you again
when the time is ripe i will pos-
sibly need you at hand what action
the chinese will take i do not yet
know but i will see what they pro-
pose when i have had a talk with
them

  how does kupfer use his power
for evil may i ask    said winthrop
for whom the subject had a fascina-
tion   does he create wars   

 oh no said dr ransome
that would be too crude and too
dangerous but the same result can
be achieved by simply creating or
maintaining discord when you have
seen as much of the world as i have
harry you will understand why
carlyle marveled that people of good
will and the great mass of the people
of all countries have good will who
have never even seen one another
should yet be found confronting each
other with weapons of destruction
and killing each other off you may
remember he asks why and then
says have they any quarrel none
in the world indeed in an indirect
way they are useful to one another
ah but their masters told them to
do it that is the secret and it is
as true today as then you dont
know the power that this man for
instance wields in the newspaper
world-few do but i know it he
can inflame a whole nation with ease
on any given issue

  but why should he persisted
the younger man

  if you were to suggest to him
that he was deliberately doing such a
thing he would possibly be highly in-
dignant and even genuinely aston-
ished said dr ransome that is
what i meant by going below zero
spiritually in a sense the man is
perhaps not morally responsible the
real evil lies in the concentration of
power in the hands of people who
havent the least idea how to employ
windows of destiny



it properly that is one thing these
orientals can not understand-how
with all our fine talk about freedom
and liberty and goodness knows
there is enough of that both spoken
and written we should still put
power into the hands of irresponsible
private persons-power that might
make an alexander or a napoleon
green with envy they can not un-
derstand it in the east and al-
though they are all the time looking
to us for guidance and counsel we
never attempt to explain it-we only
make excuses

  but in what way does discord
serve kupfers purpose asked
winthrop

  it begins chiefly in trade rival-
ries said dr ransome and trade
rivalries are really the cause of most
international troubles then trade
rivalry is followed by outside monop-
oly and control-a thing an oriental
loathes and abominates above every-
thing they know the meaning of
kupfers key of the supply chest
well enough just think what a for-
eign financier with unlimited means
can do he can make his tools and
his minions capture and corner any-
thing and he can not be stopped so
long as the prime mover or guiding
spirit is beyond your control and
in the east they are satisfied that
the master minds who are keeping the
nations of the world from amity and
brotherliness are really very few-
perhaps not more than the five i
spoke of for as i have said they
work together and are interlocked
possibly the man we have just seen
is the biggest force for disruption in
the whole round world today

  is he in so many things as all
that asked winthrop half con-
vinced

  in virtually everything that it
is possible to be in said dr ran-
some and in all of them simply
and solely for what is to be made

do you think a world can be run on
sueh lines-that you can shape the
destinies of mankind by the tricks of
the moneylender

  but getting a monopoly even of
vital things said winthrop to
whom much of the doctors talk was
anathema why need that have an
injurious effect

  dr ransome smiled

  you are young harry he said
and you live in a highly organized
country have you ever seen a small
trader crushed out-even here 
have you tried to gage the feelings
engendered do you know the mean-
ing of the term harvest of hatred
is the knocking of a mans feet from
under him-destroying his livelihood
-a thing to be done lightly and
if it is bad here and it is bad
enough what do you suppose it is
like in the east where the same busi-
ness has been in the same family for
generations where things are still
more or less chaotic and where fam-
ine stalks periodically  i can not be-
gin to tell you of the mischief
wrought no while these imps of
discord have a free hand there is no
hope for humanity that is the plain
english of the business

  but what will these men who are
coming over do asked winthrop
with a faint sense of uneasiness

 i dont know said dr ran-
some gravely but you may rest
assured you will not be an accessory
after the fact to any violence or
wrong-doing these people do not
believe in bloodshed they say and
they say rightly that just and up-
right men need never fear there is
nothing can hurt them but the
guilty man fears his guilt  

  but if this man does not know-
is not responsible asked winthrop

  let us await developments said
the doctor he is perhaps not so
far gone as we suppose


weird tales

tn the intervening weeks win-
throp went about his reporting
duties without much energy his
mind was entirely taken up with the
problem of the financier what was
to happen now  it could hardly fail
to be sensational he felt his im-
patience increased with the passing
of the days and it was with relief
that when a call came for him on the
telephone one evening about a month
after his visit to kupfer with dr
ransome he heard the doctors quiet
voice asking him to call at the hotel
next day

  our friends are here harry he
said in mattei-of-fact tones but he
might have spoken in more sounding
phrases for an hour without convey-
ing so much as he did by this simple
sentence

  next day found winthrop in dr
ransomes room being introduced to
two grave elderly oriental gentle-
men-gentlemen in the finest sense of
the term gentle amiable courteous
both were in conventional american
clothes and were to winthrops eyes
very similar in appearance excepting
that one was taller than the other
their quiet air and kindly faces
rather relieved the excitable young
reporter who had made up his mind 
for something rather formidable in
addition to resembling one another it
seemed to winthrop that the two men
also bore a striking resemblance to
dr ransome they might he
thought have been three brothers
dr ransome introduced them jocu-
larly as ho and hi for he
said their real names would be too
hard on your jaws so the tall gen-
tlemen will be mr hi since he is the
higher of the two and the other will
be mr ho

  the chinese smiled their amuse-
ment at the doctors fun

  mr kupfer is to meet us here at
 this afternoon harry said
dr ransome i will want you to

take some notes-to act as our
amanuensis -you will please attend
it is my desire and that of m friends
here

  winthrop bowed and murmured
his thanks and gratification the
simplicity and yet the seriousness of
the whole proceedings were having
an effect upon his character he felt
he had become more thoughtful and
in the interval had taken to studying
sociological problems at which he had
always laughed in the past it was
being borne in upon him that there
was work to be done and only too few
to do it he felt that he had a place
in the scheme of things previously
he had been a unit now he was a
man

  promptly at  the financier
drove up in his car he was ac-
companied by his secretary a tall
pale repressed-looking man who
entered with him on finding how-
ever that winthrop was to be pres-
ent to take notes of which he would
have a copy kupfer sent his secre-
tary back to the office and the five
men proceeded to a small parlor at-
tached to the suite of rooms occu-
pied by the chinese it was a home-
ly little room with mahogany furni-
ture and red hangings no more
prosaic place could have been imag-
ined for so momentous a gathering

  although winthrop had seen the
veteran journalist on several occa-
sions since their last long talk no
mention had been made of the spec-
tacles and beyond knowing that the
doctor had had them restored to their
gold frame winthrop had not asked
any questions about them he some-
how felt that they had served their
purpose and indeed he was not curi-
ous to look through them any more
this state of mind sometimes puzzled
him slightly he now observed how-
ever that the glasses were being worn
by hi the taller of the two chinese

  introductions were quickly made
and all sat down together at the lit-
windows of destiny



tie square table in the center of the
room kupfer at one end with hi
opposite while ho was on his left
and dr ransome with winthrop by
his side on the right kupfer had a
portfolio of papers as had also the
chinese gentlemen from which vari-
ous documents were produced and
passed around no time was lost
and the business part of the trans-
action was soon completed the chi-
nese talked very little dr ransome
acting as their spokesman but win-
throp observed in the intervals of his
note-taking that hi rarely took his
eyes from the face of the financier
opposite it gave him a slight thrill
which he did not like to class as fear


a tentative form of agreement
was quickly drawn up which
kupfer offered to take to his office
for final drafting prior to the affixing
of signatures dr ransome produced
a box of cigars from somewhere and
passed them around everything
seemed to be going along in a natural
and normal manner and harry win-
throp began to be conscious of a
sense of disappointment hi had
taken the spectacles off and they lay
on the table at his elbow a ray of
sunlight coming through a comer of
the window fell squarely upon them
and brought dazzling reflections from
the gold framework the keen eyes
of kupfer were attracted immediate-
ly

  a curious pair of spectacles he
said may i look at them

  they were passed across and he ex-
amined them with interest

  try them on dr ransome sug-
gested casually

  kupfer did so and looked around
the assembly with a faint smile of
amusement until his eyes rested up-
on the countenance of hi sitting
opposite when he appeared to be-
come suddenly transfixed his face
went ashy pale and his mouth fell
open slightly

  my god he said in a voice
shrill with terror whos that sit-
ting there who-who are you all
what are you

  his glance was darting from one
to another now and he half rose from
his chair

  whats the matter kupfer
asked dr ransome

  the financier tore the glasses from
his face and threw them violently
upon the table

  take these damn things away
he said roughly  they make me soe
things then quickly recovering
he added hastily excuse me gen-
tlemen i havent been too well
lately-been working too hard i
guess

  he seized a cigar and busied him-
self with lighting it winthrop
deemed however that he turned his
chair slightly so as to avoid looking
in the direction of the calm and
stately figure sitting opposite

  for a few moments no one spoke
and then hi leaned forward slightly
across the table and addressing him-
self to kupfer said clearly and dis-
tinctly there shall be two men at
work in the field one hall be taken
and the other left

  kupfer went paler than ever and
said sharply whats that

  a scriptural quotation said dr
ransome equably

  but what on earth is its applica-
tion here and now asked kupfer
his eyes darting round the assembly

mendous atmosphere of concentration
about the man as he sat there that
winthrops hand trembled as he
wrote his flesh crept and he was
conscious that the hair on his head
bristled he felt as if he was in the
midst of mighty forces that tossed
him hither and thither

  what the devils all this rot ran-
some asked kupfer angrily
whats the man quoting that stuff
to me for doesnt he know it re-
fers to fighters

  who said it referred to fight-
ers said dr ransome sternly
why should it refer to fighters
the worlds affairs are not settled by
fighters as you know well enough
the master minds do not fight they
make others fight for them just as
they make others read and write for
them

  i am not here to discuss such
things said kupfer furiously
come-our business is finished 

  he rose from his chair

 sit down said dr ransome
authoritatively

  winthrop gasped this was a new
dr ransome that he did not know

  whats this said kupfer with
an uneasy laugh but sitting down
nevertheless a holdup or a kid-
napping game or something his
eyes were roving around the room
after the manner of a hunted ani-
mals have you gone mad ran-
some

  you will sit down there sir and
listen to what i have to say to you
said dr ransome in a tone that
stirred winthrops blood by its pas-
sionate feeling you boasted not
long ago that you watched me very
good i have been watching you
too i know you i have seen your
handiwork in every corner of the civ-
ilized globe and nowhere has it been
good you are one of the cords that
is strangling the soul of my country

i	know you you thought the trial
between east and west was to be

one of fighters did you you hoped
so no doubt poor fool do you
think the masses can be forever set
on to slaughter one another-that
there is no destiny working slowly
and certainly to raise poor deluded
humanity from such a slough

  in his righteous indignation and
blazing anger ransome was magnifi-
cent winthrop felt half afraid of
him

  i am ready said hi once more

  the dreadful calmness of his tone
after the fiery eloquence of dr ran-
some produced on kupfer an effect
that was nothing short of terrifying
he cowered in his seat

 observe the man before you
continued dr ransome speaking
more gently and indicating hi by a
nod of his head he is one of the
greatest men the world has ever
known if you but knew man the
extent to which you are honored that
the trial should be between you two-
that you may be the very man of
destiny if you will but play a proper
part come kupfer do your duty
do you think for a moment that i
your fellow countryman would stoop
to such a thing as the foul play i can
see your mind suspects  try to
compose yourself how gladly would

i	play the part for you could it but
be done why there may await you
a glory that might make even your
ambitious soul rejoice what is it
that you fear

  death said ho suddenly

  it was the first time he had spoken
and the effect of his voice was start-
ling

  death said dr ransome con-
temptuously dont tell me kup-
fer that you fear death i couldnt
believe it of you-you who have
gambled with life and death on a
colossal scale have held the keys of
supply chests-have juggled with
men like pawns and puppets making
here and breaking there as suited the
windows of destiny



purpose yon fear death dont
tell me

  kupfer sat silent but his ashen
face told the tale only too well yet
he still strove to bluster

  this is all damned nonsense he
said in the tone that he usually em-
ployed to strike terror-and whieh
generally did it is madness you
will be sorry for your little joke ran-
some for i can break you easily
enough

  you certainly can said dr
ransome smiling compassionately
poor fellow you certainly can

rthe chinese meantime had been
acting from somewhere about
his person hi produced an object
wrapped in yellow silk he pro-
ceeded to unwind it and presently he
laid upon the table a quaint and
beautiful little chalice in the form of
a golden dragon the four legs of
which constituted the stand or sup-
port while the arched back bore the
little golden bowl itself the capacity
of which appeared as if it might be
about an ordinary mouthful the
dragons body was beautifully carved
and inlaid the head facing for-
ward and tilted upward at a slight
angle was embellished with two small
but brilliant green zircons which took
the place of the eyes the brightness
of these stones combined with the
open jaws and protruding forked
tongue of the image produced an ef-
fect at once ferocious and sinister
which truly bespoke oriental work-
manship and design the whole
thing did not stand more than six
inches high nor weigh in excess of
twelve or fourteen ounces although
so exquisite was the workmanship
that a suggestion of heaviness and
solidity was conveyed ho had in
the meantime taken from one of his
pockets a tiny gold phial the top of
which he unscrewed and rising from
his seat he poured the contents a dull

red liquid into the little bowl then
    w t-

placing the dragon in the center of
the table facing across to where dr
ransome was sitting he resumed his
seat kupfers eyes were riveted in
fascinated horror to the thing on the
table dr ransome continued to
speak

    there is the draft that may mean
either paradise or perdition he said
solemnly one of you must drink
we await but the sign

  he made a peculiar sweep with his
right arm and said something in a
strange tongue then he folded his
arms and stood silent

  all eyes were fixed upon the drag-
on for a few moments there was
tense silence and then a cry broke
from kupfer accompanied by an
exclamation from the young reporter
for the head of the image was mov-
ing moving slowly and tremblingly
as if the brute was shaking itself
from some kind of lethargy the
tongue was withdrawn the mouth
closed and the green eyes flashed
balefully as the head turned slowly
first to the left slightly and then
round to the right as if surveying
the countenances of all present lit-
tle streams of green light like the
widening rays of small searchlights
seemed to issue forth from the bril-
liant eyes as they were fastened in
turn upon the orbs of each person
as winthrop met the flash he felt his
hair bristle again on his head and
after the eyes had passed him he had
a sense of being left in the darkness

round went the head round and
still farther round to the right un-
til the creature appeared to be look-
ing right over his shoulder in the
direction of ho who was seated be-
hind then slowly the head came
back again to the left round round
until the eyes were fixed upon the
ghastly countenance of kupfer
there they remained fixed while the
mouth opened once more and the
tongue shot forth in the direction of
the financier for about fifteen sec-
a

weird tales

onds this attitude was maintained
and then the head slowly resumed
its normal forward position

  you are the man kupfer said
dr ransome quietly drink

  the financier was by this time in
a pitiable condition but he still
strove desperately to master himself
from time to time he licked his lips
and his eyes darted freqiiently in the
direction of the door-a fact that did
not escape the observation of dr
ransome

  there is the key of the door kup-
fer he said taking it from his
pocket and laying it on the table
you are free to go whenever you
choose and to take what proceedings
you may see fit what you are ex-
pected to do here you must do of
your own volition but you will have
to face this test some day some-
where you can not escape it he
said this in a tone of solemn convic-
tion that was impressive in the ex-
treme

  if i fail there shall come an-
other said hi in his passionless
voice and after him another-and
then another they will be more
numerous than the grains of sand in
the desert and ever they will pre-
sent you with the cup

  bluff and intimidation snarled
kupfer clutching the door-key but
yet remaining with his eyes fixed up-
on the golden dragon trickery
and nonsense you shall all answer

for it-every one of you he

writhed in his seat yet seemed in-
capable of rising from it

 come kupfer said dr ran-
some again after an interval of
silence during which winthrop was
sure that the beating of his heart
must have been audible to all pres-
ent take the draft as i said
before i would take it for you if i
could-for the credit of the west
but i can not you have seized the
power and not i

 the power said kupfer al-
most with a shriek and commencing
to twist his hands one about the
other   leave me the power take
the wealth if you want it    but i
must have the power

  his hands were extended before
him now stretching in the direction
of the dragon his eyes still glued
upon it his attitude was almost one
of supplication winthrop thought
with a shudder of terror and wrath

  i must have the strings in my

own hands-the wires the

squeaking voice continued must
feel them slacken and taut in my
grasp    with a movement pull
down or stiffen up some figure
across continents-oceans  make
them dance ha ha

  the tension went from his rigid
figure and his arms and head col-
lapsed weakly on the table win-
throp laid down his pencil the sight
sickened him and he could write no
more

  but its all damned nonsense i
tell you said kupfer recovering
himself once more and starting to his
feet  i  teach you all somebody
will pay for this

  he seized the key and rushing to
the door began to fight frantically
with the lock his panic returning as
he found the key refusing to work
curses and imprecations broke from
him

  the door isnt locked kupfer
said dr ransome quietly   go right
out

  in his frenzy kupfer did not hear
or could not comprehend still the
rattling and scrambling continued
and still he cursed and tugged until
presently he actually locked the door
then in a trice he unlocked it again
and was gone

silence reigned for some time after
 the financiers sensational depart-
ure and then dr ransome said
windows of destiny



rather sadly thus conscience doth
make cowards of us all

  no one made any reply but both
chinese smiled a trifle grimly obey-
ing a sudden impulse the doctor drew
the golden dragon toward him and
placing it before the startled young
reporter said authoritatively drink
it harry

  the young man took the little
image in his hand and for a moment
hesitated to his excited and over-
wrought fancy it seemed as if the
very claws of the brute were wind-
ing around his fingers while the lit-
tle green eyes sparkled with added
fire then putting the bowl to his
lips he drank off the contents with a
mighty gulp the liquid seemed to
course like fire through his veins-
then he glowed all over

  never tasted better port wine in
your life did you harry said dr
ransome laughing while broad
smiles illuminated the faces of the
chinese

  no sir replied winthrop in
rather a shamefaced tone as he
thought of his momentary funk i
certainly never did  

  the nervous reaction brought upon
him by the sudden change from hor-
ror to bathos actually caused him to
tremble in spite of himself he laid
the dragon upon the table and sur-
veyed it solemnly

  but i am ready to swear dr
ransome he said that i saw this
creature turn its head and look
around at all of us

  if you had had a camera harry
and had taken a snap you would

have found something different
said the doctor laughing again   the
trick is an old one in the east the
little fellows head as you can see is
quite rigid

  and all the marvelous things i
saw through the glasses said win-
throp incredulously and in some dis-
appointment were they all the
result of hynotism too   

  to a certain extent said dr
ransome   if you surround the
commonest kind of an object with
sufficient mystery wonderful results
can be achieved the subject him-
self in his interest and excitement
supplies most of the energy while
another mind guides

  and what do you suppose will
happen now if i may ask said
harry thinking again of kupfer

   it is a little difficult to tell re-
plied dr ransome kupfer may
retire from business shortly on the
score of ill health or he may con-
tinue his activities on a less aggres-
sive scale or he may carry right
along on his present lines and i may
have a new and ferocious enemy
either of the first two courses seems
the most probable but in the event of
the third some further action may be
necessary  

  again he spoke in the strange
tongue and both chinese bowed their
heads in acquiesence

  and in that case there may be
something further for me to do
enquired the young man eagerly

  perhaps said dr ransome
smiling   one never knows

a ghost-tale of santo domingo

by arthur j burks

people who know me say that
i am insane many of them
tell me so to my face they do
it jokingly but in their eyes i read
that they half believe it

  but who wouldnt be crazy after
going through what i experienced
during those dread hours when hud-
dled in the after cockpit of a wrecked
airplane in the very center of the
dread gran estero the pilot dead in
the seat ahead of me with his brains
dashed out i sat the hours away with
my eyes peering into the shadows of
the great swamp

 perhaps i did not see all the
things memory brings to mind from
that dread page of the past for the
silver plate in my head suggests
many things added to which there is
a long blank in it somewhere during
which i somehow won free of the mys-
terious region of rotting slime and
bubbling ooze-a blank that i find
myself glad i can not fill for it
must have contained terrible things

  we had taken off from the flying
field at santo domingo city with
plenty of time to spare ere we should
be due at santiago it only takes a
little over an hour and it still lacked
three hours of sundown when we
lifted in a series of climbing turns
into the sunny sky of the dominican
republic

  but we had forgotten the fog which
sometimes rises suddenly in the pass
through the cordilleras

 we were half-way through when
the fog was upon us shutting us out
from the ground below as effectually
as though we both had suddenly gone

blind and were hurtling through a
sea of mist at more than a hundred
miles an hour-quite too fast to think
of piling up on some unseen moun-
tainside i could scarcely see the
pilot in the seat ahead he looked
back at me once and shook his head
then he tried to see the ground below
us as did i but whichever way we
looked there was nothing but that sea
of impenetrable white even the
roaring of the engines was mufiled by
the density of the fog

  the pilot came back on his stick
and i knew by the way my back
pressed against the cowling in rear
that he was pointing her nose into the
sky in the hope of climbing above the
clouds

  minutes that seemed like hours
passed as we continued to climb on a
slant just great enough to keep from
stalling but great enough that i
knew we had already cleared the tops
of the mountains on either hand yet
the fog held steadily it must have
been miles high

  then the aviator got confused i
dont blame him though i havo
never flown a plane i have ridden in
planes many times and know what it
means to be caught in a fog or among
heavy clouds which shut out the
earth had he flown straight he
might have ridden through the fog
but he did a turn or two in an at-
tempt to find an opening and lost us
completely only by the slackness of
the belt which held me in could i be
sure that we were flying right-side ug
-which was all i did know
faces



  the altimeter said  feet with
the needle crawling slowly toward the
 mark and still the fog

  finally the flyer held her nose in
one direction at least he tried to and
plunged like a mad thing through the
fog yet we didnt penetrate the
mist wall

  long after we should have reached
santiago we were still in the fog still
above  feet and darkness was
settling down upon us

  there was enough gas in the tanks
when we left the field to keep us in
the air for four hours my wrist-
watch told me that we lacked but
fifteen minutes of that time in
gods name where were we we
might as easily have been far out
over the atlantic ocean the carib-
bean sea or mona passage

  i know now that we came down
within five miles of bahia de esco-
cesa which is an arm of the atlantic
and that had our luck held for a
few minutes more we might have
made a fairly safe landing on the
broad shelving beach just a few
minutes as time is figured and a life
is lost-while another man lives to
hear himself called a madman

  the engine spluttered and died
what a dread silence after the roar-
ing of the motors

  the humming of the wind through
the wires and braces told me that we
were spiraling downward we might
be headed for a mountaintop or for
the open sea and certain drowning-
or might be heading directly into the
field at santiago though only a fool
could have hoped for such great
good fortune and still the fog
about us held

  the pilot flung his helmet and gog-
gles over the side and looked back at
me grinning widely

  were through kid he said
aint one chance in ten thousand of
getting out of this with our hides
lets hope that they find the remains
sometime

  i am not ashamed to confess that i
could not take it so light-heartedly as
this but then i am not made of the
stuff of which flyers are constructed

  the aviator turned his eyes back to
the instruments on the board before
him and our spiral continued to the
tune of the wind in the struts a tune
that had a sinister meaning a tune
that sang of death up-rushing to meet
us the altimeter said  feet
now with the needle fairly dancing
down toward zero

when we broke through the fog
we were directly above a forest
of nodding treetops with scarcely a
breathing space before the inevitable
crash which could have been avoided
only did a miracle happen and the
propeller start whirling again

  it seemed to me that we leveled
and seemed to sink straight into the
forest though common sense told me
that we must have struck at a speed
of not less than ninety miles an hour
we hit the treetops and crashed
through

  my head banged against the cowl-
ing when we hit and i remember
nothing afterward-until i opened
my eyes in the shadows which hold
sway in el gran estero and found
that the safety belt still held me in
my seat what was left of our right
wing was above the dank waters of
the vast swamp while on my left i
could see nothing but shadows and
the oozy slime of the dread quagmire
only the main part of our ship had
held together and this was steadily
sinking forward because of the dead
weight of the motor

  the aviator was asprawl in the
forward cockpit his arms hanging
over the side i noted that blood
dripped from the fingers of his right
hand

  i unfastened my belt and leaned
forward swaying dizzily as a terrible
feeling of vertigo seized me


weird tales

  i shook the aviator roughly by the
shoulder

 mckenzie i shouted are
you bad hurt boy

  he was for as i shook him pull-
ing him around by the shoulder i
caught a glimpse of his face it was
not a face but a bloody smear with a
gaping wound in the forehead his
body was still warm proof that i had
been unconscious but a short time
there was no mark of blood on the
cowling before mckenzies face and
i wondered what had dealt him that
blow which had dashed out his brains
leaning forward carefully i strove to
peer down into the cockpit

  when i saw what had done it i all
but collapsed for the forward
cockpit had fallen squarely upon the
jagged stump of a tree and this had
gone through the light fabric and
penetrated mckenzies body in a
way that i find myself unable to
mention in cold print he had been
dead even before that blood-stained
stump had come  through to bash
out his brains

  there was nothing i could do for
him and there seemed little chance
of saving myself

 i knew that i was somewhere
within mysterious gran estero in a
plane that was gradually sinking of
its own weight-and that i was
mighty fortunate to have lived even
this long besides which i knew that
i was badly hurt how badly i could
only guess-as you can do when i
tell you that a goodly portion of my
skull is silver at the present moment

  how to get out and what direction
to take how to reach land solid
enough to support my weight in
the daytime i knew i could have done
it somehow-had i been in full pos-
session of my faculties and my
strength

  i studied the swamp around me
but as far as i could see in the dark-
ness there was nothing but oozy
morass into which i should have dis-

appeared within a few minutes at
most ever the plane seemed to sink
lower as though a great mouth were
relentlessly sucking it down

  my head was aching terribly and
oddly colored dots were dancing be-
fore my eyes any moment i ex-
pected to lose consciousness-and
rather hoped that did i do so i
would never regain it death would
be easy and would save me untold
trouble and privation to say nothing
of unplumbed suffering

  well why dont you climb out of
there and find us a way out

  i started as though someone had
suddenly placed a hot iron against
my quivering flesh in my mind i
heard the words yet i swear that my
ears had heard nothing at all just
an impression that someone had
spoken-an impression that had the
force of actuality

  the hair at the back of my neck
seemed to lift oddly as i whirled and
stared into the gloom which was now
so deep in gran estero that i could
scarcely see my hand before my face

 under a tree with many great
branches in the very midst of an
area acrawl with the ooze of the vast
quagmire stood lieutenant mcken-
zie boyishly smiling as he had smiled
before the crash from his puttees
to his helmet and goggles he was
dressed for flying-save for that
ghastly red weal across his forehead

 my eyes must have bulged from
their sockets as i stared at him for
he smiled again and the smile froze
on his lips never again to leave them
this time when he spoke his voice
sounded hollow and as cld as a voice
from the tomb

 well get going we must get
out of here  

  yet i couldnt move a muscle

  will you understand why when i
mention that the dead body of mc-
kenzie still lolled motionless in the
forward cockpit
faces



  mckenzie was dead killed in a
manner that has many times since
caused me to waken from horrible
nightmares with screams on my lips
yet he couldnt be dead when i could
see him as plainly as you see this
page standing there beneath that tree
in the midst of gran estero

 i screamed aloud when i found
that i could look through that figure
under the tree and see the bole of the
tree itself still that frozen smile
rested upon those white lips still
that red weal showed on the forehead
beneath the helmet-a red weal that
seemed to be steadily dripping drip-
ping dripping

  then i began to laugh a horrible
laugh in which my body shook so
convulsively that i all but fell out of
the cockpit into the slime

  and as i laughed the phantom of
mckenzie disappeared as though a
breath had erased it leaving me
alone in the sinking plane with the
dead body for company

  but my laughter was short-lived

  for looking around again for some
possible footing place my eyes found
something in the swamp which had at
first escaped my notice-a pair of
bare feet with their water-whitened
soles just above the surface of the
ooze by some weird necromancy i
could look down through the mud to
the body which hung upside-down be-
low those feet-the skeleton of a na-
tive who had been lost in the swamp

  for some reason my eyes darted
back to where i had seen the phan-
tom of mckenzie to see the figure of
a ragged native in his place this
one looked at me out of sunken eyes
and slowly his arm upraised as he
pointed to the bare feet which were
all that i could now see of the grue-
some thing just outside the plane a
voice issued from the motionless lips
of the native-a voice that spoke soft
words in gentle spanish

  si senor said the voice it is
i whom you see there

  wildly i laughed and the phan-
tom of the native vanished as the
shade of mckenzie had done at the
sound of my maniacal laughter

  wildly since i knew that my mind
was going because of this weird hor-
ror i searched the jungle wall with
frightened eyes

the night drew on apace and i
will not dwell on it unduly for i
know that in that direction lies mad-
ness-madness more mad even than
is now mine

  for i discovered that el gran es-
tero is the trysting place of countless
shades

  out of the shadows they came to
stare at me-out of the shadows to
stare to smile coldly and to vanish-
while i laughed at each in turn

  it is strange that i laughed but i
could not help it for my head ached
abominably and i laughed to ease
the pain is that a good reason to
me at the time it seemed so but per-
haps i laughed at the faces

  the faces

  i lost count of their vast number
for assuredly there must have been
many who have lost their lives in el
gran estero-whose faces came up
before me for the lips to smile coldly
to smile coldly and to vanish while
others came to take their places

  as it grew cooler as the night drew
on will-o-the-wisps came up from the
ooze balls of weird flame balls that
had the shape of faces with smiling
lips-all sorts of faces faces of ne-
groes men and women-yes and
children faces of dominicans
bronze-burnished by a smiling sun
with here and there the pale staring
faces of white men thank god
there were but few of these for i
found myself unable to look into their
staring eyes it was as though the
white men were brothers of mine and
that i had somehow failed them in the
weary search for a way out of the
vast quagmire when they smiled


weird tales

coldly reproachfully and i could
give them no aid they would shake
their heads sadly and disappear only
to show again down some vista
through the tree-lanes always looking
back at me sadly before they disap-
peared for good

  the saddest of them all was a white
woman with a babe in her arms she
stood for many minutes where mc-
kenzie and the native had stood and
her eyes were sunken caverns ablaze
with a vast reproach her eyes
searched ceaselessly the wall of trees
seeking seeking seeking at last she
wandered down a lane through the
trees gliding softly atop the ooze
she looked back several times as she
wandered aimlessly away and once i
fancied i could hear the subdued
wailing of the babe in her arms she
must have heard it too for her head
bent as though she soothed the phan-
tom infant she did not look up
again and thus soothing the baby
with which she must have died she
vanished into the vastness of the
swamp i wondered what man had
been the cause of her going to her
death in gran estero for there was
that in her eyes that told me a man
was to blame

  faces faces always the faces
and the dead blackness of el gran
estero

  when all the shades i had seen to-
gether with a host i had never seen
before some of the latter aborigines
who must have gone to their death in
the swamp during the regime of
columbus and his governors came at
last and gathered in the ooze about
me to smile coldly and sadly into my
face i must have gone clear out of
my head for that is the last dread
happening which i remember

  the plane had sunk so low that
slime was beginning to trickle into
the cockpit in which i still sat hud-
dled when the army of shades gath-
ered about me-silent and motionless
as though they waited for something

did they wait for me to lead them out
of this never-ending thraldom of
theirs i do not know i do not
know anything about it

  i only know the next thing i re-
member is that i awoke in a cot in the
hospital in santiago and that the
colonel of the regiment occupying the
city was sitting at my bedside
when i opened my eyes the colonel
turned to the doctor

  can he talk now doctor

  the doctor nodded

  i told the colonel all that had be-
fallen me as i talked i saw a queer
light eome into his eyes and knew
that he doubted my story may per-
haps even have blamed me a little
for what happened i wonder why
his questions took a queer trend at
the last

  why didnt you go back into the
swamp with mckenzie and help him
salvage the engine of the plane

  but mckenzie is dead sir he
was killed in the crash

  again that queer light in his eyes

  but the natives who found you
at the edge of the swamp swear that
a man in uniform was with you-a
man in helmet and goggles a man
answering in every detail the descrip-
tion of mckenzie they say he led
you out but that as soon as he had
attracted their attention and saw
that you would be taken in charge
he turned back into the swamp be-
fore they could come close to him
you should have gone back in with
him

  but assuredly the colonel must
have been mistaken perhaps his
limited spanish caused him to misin-
terpret the reports of the natives i
know in my heart that mckenzie
never left that forward cockpit after
the crash into el gran estero

  but do i know after all there is
that blank to be accounted for and
often i waken in the middle of the
night and lie awake until dawn won-

to death by the dying struggles of the ape-bat
and in company with drorathusa and her com-
panions they wander into a veritable dantes in-
ferno beneath sea-level on their way to drome
carter waking suddenly as the dromans and he
are slumbering sees a monstrous ghostly shape
coming straight toward him from the roof of the
cavern

chapter 

the moving eyes

 jerked out my revolver i
reached over and gave rhodes a
shake that would have awakened
epimenides himself then grabbed
the electric light and flashed it upon
the descending monster

  i could scarcely believe my eyes
nothing but the empty air the
monster had vanished

  whats the matter came the
sudden voice of rhodes what in
paradise is going on now

  i rubbed my eyes and stared up-
ward once more

  look there said i pointing
tell me do you see nothing there
there isnt anything there bill
-now

  but there was something there a
second ago-and it didnt go away
what did you see

  i thought at first that it was a
demon phosphorescent or something
it was up there i tell you it was
up there and it was coming down
coming down straight toward this
very spot

  great caesars spook exclaimed
rhodes

  i cant understand i told him
where the thing went it was there
and the next instant it wasnt  
turn off your light said rhodes
quickly  turn it off bill 

  great zeus what for youd bet-
ter have your revolver ready

  revolver fiddlesticks off with
it bill off with the light

  the light went off and look
there it was again-almost directly
over us it was not descending now
but was hovering hovering as though
watching waiting waiting for what 
and it seemed too to thrust out
arms or tcntacula and look some-
thing started to drop from it-phos-
phorescence i shall call it that
dropping to the floor where it
writhed and crawled about like a
mass of serpents writhed and
crawlfed and grew dimmer-faded
faded

  we sat staring at this mysterious
inexplicable phenomenon in amaze-
ment fascination and horror

 what on earth can it be i
asked my voice a whisper

  who said rhodes would ever
have dreamed of such a thing as
that

  im afraid i told him a shud-
der passing through my heart that
our revolvers cant hurt a thing like
this it seems to be watching us
look arent those eyes-eyes star-
ing at us moving

  eyes watching us oh lord
bill   said rhodes

  as for sending a bullet into it
dont he added do anything so
foolish  

  he arose stepped over and awoke

                                   


weird tales

narkus the monster was still hover-
ing over the spot the droman be-
stowed upon that ghost but a cursory
careless look then yawned sleepily

  yam-yump said narkus
stretching himself

 rhodes laid a hand upon the
others shoulder and pointed an inter-
rogative finger up in the direction of
the phantom the droman gave a
careless airy toss of the hand

  drome said he then lay down
again

  it was obvious from this mono-
syllabic answer to say nothing of the
manner of narkus that there was
nothing to apprehend from this mys-
terious apparition hovering above us
certainly though there had been no
remarkable clarification indeed in
a way rhodes and i were more
puzzled than ever drome drome
w hat could be the meaning of that
word  drome

  it seems bill said rhodes
that we are on our way to a very
strange place as for that ghost up
there it must be a fragment as it
were of the ligh t of this subterranean
land  

  suppose it is-a harbinger so
to speak--then what on earth can
that light be

  that of course we can not tell
it may be phosphorescent or auroral
or its origin may be one of which no
man of our own world ever has even
dreamed i believe that i forgot to
mention when we were speaking of
this the other day that even human
beings sometimes evolve light one

  	a very decided luminosity has been observed
to proceed from dissecting-room subjects the light
thus evolved being sufficient to render the forms
of the bodies as well as those of muscles and
other dissected parts which are peculiarly
bright almost as distinct as in the daylight

          three cases are recorded by sir h marsh
in which an evolution of light took placi from the
living body    the light in each case is de-
scribed as playing around the face but not as
directly proceeding from the surface and in one
of these instances which was recorded by dr d
donovan not only was the luminous appearance
perceptible over the head of the patients bed but
luminous vapors passed in streams through the
apartment-dr carpenter

thing however is certain there is
light somewhere in this underground
world and i believe bill that we
are drawing near to it now  

  i certainly hope that we are
but look at our ghost it is moving
again-thank heaven even if it is
only a mass of light away from us 
yes said rhodes but look
down there there is another one
coming

  it came and another and another
i dont know how many on they
came through the cavern now linger-
ing now hovering on they passed
like some unearthly ghostly proces-
sion and even though one knew
that these phantoms so dim and so
misty were perfectly innocuous were
as natural as though there is any-
thing that can not be natural as
the light of the firefly as the glow of
the auroral arches and streamers-
all the same i say the sight of that
spectral company passing passing
was one indescribably strange and
uncanny

  however a man can get used to
anything i got used to them and
ere very long was asleep once more
in the morning not a single ghost
was to be seen nor did we see one
until near midaftemoon that ghost
was all by its lonesome and so dim
that it vanished when our lights drew
near but soon they were about us
in all directions one of these phan-
toms large amorphous writhing its
light so strong that it was visible in
the rays of the lamps but not of the
electric ones came crawling along
the floor straight toward us rhodes
and i as if by instinct moved aside
but drorathusa and the others walked
right into it as they emerged from
the spectral phosphorescent mass
the light clung to them like wraiths
of fog to be slowly dissipated as they
advanced in little streams and ed-
dies behind them

  it was during this afternoon too
that rhodes made the first discovery
drome



of life in this fearsome place-little
fish totally blind like those in the
mammoth cave but though they
could not see they could feel the
light when the rays fell upon the
stream they would drop to the bot-
tom and seek the concealment of the
shadow-places poor little blind
things what an existence and yet
how like them after all are we poor
humans

   yes blind are we though we have
eyes our souls shrinking from the
light to wander lost and happy in
psychic caves and labyrinths more
terrible even than this cavern
through which we were making our
way-making our way to we knew
not what

tte journeyed on until about 

v	 oclock when we reached an-
other depot and halted for the night
all were much fatigued but the dro-
mans were in high spirits and ours
rose too whether we were drawing
near the end of our strange journey
was not clear but there could be no
doubt that a great change was immi-
nent

  to the surprize of rhodes and
myself nothing in the place seemed
to surprize drorathusa and her com-
panions not a single light-wraith
was anywhere to be seen the cav-
ern was as black as the deepest pit in
erebus

   and it was still the same when we
awoke how i would have welcomed
the appearance of the faintest loneli-
est ghost-as we called these ap-
paritions of light

  we noticed that narkus and
thumbra and the ladies also were at
some pains to have their bows in such
a position that they could be drawn
from the quivers at an instants
warning narkus saw us watching
and sweeping a hand toward the
darkness before us he said loop-
muke

  that as we well knew is the dro-
man word for ape-bat also he tried
to tell us about something else but
the only thing intelligible in his
pantomimic explanations was that it
was about a creature even more
formidable than a wild loopmuke

  it was with keen anticipation on
the part of rhodes and myself that
we set out that morning for an
hour or so there was no change not
a single light-wraith had shone in the
awful blackness then after passing
through a particularly broken and
tortuous place be began to see them
not many however and all were
faint another hour passed and of a
sudden the walls drew together and
the roof came sloping down down
and down until we had to go bent
over narrower and narrower grew
the way crowding us at last to the
waters edge and then into the very
stream itself

  drorathusa and narkus were lead-
ing rhodes and i bringing up the
rear fortunately the current was a
gentle one had it been otherwise the
place would have been simply im-
passable

  i certainly said milton at last
admire the man maybe he was a
woman who first came through this
awful place

  the next instant he made a rush
forward delphis the white-haired
girl had slipped out into deep water
rhodes caught her just in time to
save her from immersion and drew
her back to the shallow water by the
wall not a cry not the faintest
sound had escaped her and now she
only laughed beauty was not the
only quality that these droman
ladies possessed to win your admira-
tion

  for ten minutes or so we toiled
our way down that tunnel now hug-
ging the wall now following the shal-
lows out into the stream and at times
to the other side then of a sudden
there was an exclamation from drora-


weird tales

thusa and the next moment we had
issued from the tunnel and the stream
and found ourselves in a great lofty
cavern

  great rameses i exclaimed as
we stepped forth look at those
things

  rhodes i found had already halt-
ed and was gazing up at them-two
colossi one on either side of the
mouth of the tunnel these earven
monsters we were of course stand-
ing between their bases were seated
and one was a male the other a fe-
male they had not been fashioned
in situ but clearly had been brought
to the spot in sections but how had
those massive pieces of rock the
smallest of which weighed tons been
raised into their places who can
tell it remains and probably al-
ways will remain one of the myster-
ies of that lost and mysterious land

  we were getting rather used to
strange things now but so remark-
able were these great statues for
some minutes we lingered there be-
fore them

 the dromans had moved on we
followed to find ourselves in a few
moments before a monstrous earven
human head there was the great
pedestal and there lying face up-
ward before it was the great head-
that and nothing more

  poor fellow said i as we walked
around the caput where is the rest
of him  and why did they leave the
head lying like this

  	 i have an idea   milton returned
that there was no rest of him that
this head was all that was to be
placed upon that pedestal

  i suppose that rhodes was right
one wonders what happened there so
long ago why the great caput was
never raised to the plaee which they
had prepared for it no man can tell
that now all we know is that there
the great head lies that there it has
lain for untold thousands of years

  at last milton rhodes climbed up
and stood upon the chin in order as
he said to get a good view of the
poor ginks phiz and not only
that but he stood upon the poor fel-
lows nose-yes balanced himself on
one foot on the very tip of it 

  i turned my look to the dromans
with some apprehension for i did
not know what superstitious ideas
they might entertain feared that to
them this acrobatic stunt of rhodes
might be sacrilege itself my misgiv-
ings however were groundless the
dromans were delighted they burst
into merry laughter they applaud-
ed vociferously even drorathusa
laughed outright

  little wonder forsooth for a pret-
ty figure rhodes made balanced up
there on the poor fellows olfactory
protuberance a fine posture truly
for one of the worlds i mean our
worlds great scientists and i eould
not help wondering what certain
dignified old fellows milton called
them fossils would have thought
eould they by television or some
miracle have seen him there and
what would the dromans themselves
think well i was glad when he
came down and there was an end to
that foolishness

 and i put in a prompt remon-
strance

  we i told him have-or at
any rate we ought to have-a cer-
tain dignity to uphold for we are
the representatives as it were of that
great sunlit world above the world
of archimedes kepler galileo new-
ton darwin edison-not a world of
judys and punches

 aw bill said rhodes now
quit your kidding

  what can you do with a man like
that

vxe soon quitted the spot the

v	v light-masses were all about us
now some came slowly gliding
some crawling along the floor some
drome



along the walls and the roof others
floated along overhead or hung mo-
tionless in the air the changes of
form were sometimes very rapid and
certainly as unaccountable as the
masses themselves occasionally we
would see a mass slowly take form in
the darkness and as slowly fade into
darkness again where did the light
come from where did it go and the
explanation of this uncanny phenom-
enon undoubtedly some electric
manifestation said rhodes anal-
ogous perhaps to the light of the
aurora that i objected really ex-
plained nothing and rhodes ad-
mitted that that was just what it did
explain-nothing

  the spirits of the dromans rose
higher as we toiled our way onward
and down they quickened their
pace and as we swung along like
soldiers marching they suddenly
broke into a song or rather a chant
the wonderful contralto voice of
drorathusa leading the sounds com-
ing back from the dark secret places
of the cavern in echoes sweet as the
voices heard in fairyland

  the light-masses were steadily in-
creasing in number and volume es-
pecially was this pronounced in the
great chambers fungoid growths
were seen coleopterous insects and at
last a huge scolopendra of an aspect
indescribably horrible from this
repulsive creature the dromans and
myself drew back but milton rhodes
bent over it in a true scientific scru-
tiny and ecstasy

  look bill look he cried sud-
denly pointing the body has
thirty-five somites or segments

    thirty-five segments   i queried
scratching my head and wishing that
the scolopendra was in jericho
what is there so wonderful about
that

  why said he in the scolo-
pendridae of our own world the seg-
ments of the body never exceed twen-
ty-one and this one has thirty-five

really bill i must keep so remark-
able and splendid a specimen  
great gorgons and hydras
keep it dont touch the horrible
thing it may be venomous deadly
as a cobra and besides youll have
plenty of time to collect specimens
and probably some of them will make
this one look like the last rose of
summer leave the hideous thing
alone why the dromans will think
that you are dippy fact is i believe
that they are beginning to think so
already

  let em said rhodes with true
philosophic indifference   people
thought that galileo was erazy and
newton and darwin columbus was
non compos mentis fulton was dip-
py and edison was looney yes at
one time the great inventor bore the
beautiful sobriquet of looney edi-
son listen to me billy me lad the
greatest compliment that a scientist
can ever receive is to be called a sap
by sapheads  

  all that i admitted was very true
and truly cogent in its place but this
was not its place and the dromans
certainly were neither sapheads nor
saps to my relief and indeed to
my surprize i dissuaded him from
taking the thing as a specimen and
on we went once more

  at length we left the stream which
went plunging into a more fearsome
place into which no man could ever
dream of following it soon after
that the descent became very steep
the going however was good and we
went down at a rapid pace this
lasted for two or three hours and we
had descended many hundreds of
feet the slope then suddenly be-
came gentle and we were making our
way through a perfect maze of tortu-
ous galleries and passages which at
times opened into halls and cham-
bers

  	the very children it is said pointed to their
foreheads as he passed being taught to regard
him as a kind of madman-irving


weird

tales

  the light was no longer in masses
but in streams-streams that crawled
and shivered and shook as though in
it spirit things were immersed and
were struggling to break from it
the fungal growths were everywhere
now there were mushrooms with
pilei bigger than umbrellas shapes
as grotesque as if seen through the
eyes of madness there were growths
too that one could almost think beau-
tiful and masses hideous and slimy
as so much octopi a strong and most
unpleasant odor filled the place and
here and there almost everywhere in
the strange fungoid growth were
things creeping crawling-things for
which i can find no name and for
some of them i am glad that i can
not

  it was a weird scene an indescrib-
able scene one horrible mysterious
and yet strangely wonderful too a
place gloomy and weird as any ever
conceived by dante or dore and
through it human forms were mov-
ing and its stillness was broken by
human voices raised in song and
moving with these human beings
these inhabitants of a world as alien
as that of venus or of mars were
rhodes and i we two modern men
from the great modern world above-
the wonderful the awful world of the
sun

  of a sudden an exclamation rang
out-an exclamation that stilled the
song on the instant brought the
party to an abrupt halt and the bow
of narkus and that of thumbra
from the quivers

  the exclamation had broken from
rhodes he was pointing into the
gloom off to our right a tense expect-
ant look on his face

  i peered with straining eyes but
could see nothing there a few
moments passed and nothing was
seen i then turned to rhodes to ask
him what it was but the words i
was about to speak were never ut-
tered instead i gave something like

a cry and whirled round for a
sound had come from out the fungoid
growth and the darkness behind us-
a sound as of a slimy thing moving
slipping

nothing however was to be seen
there and silence utter silence had
fallen upon the spot-silence sud-
denly broken by another exclamation
from rhodes

great heaven i cried as i
whirled back to the direction in
which he was pointing they are
all around us

look bill-look at that

i saw nothing for a second or two
and then off in the darkness beyond
the reach of our lights it was as
though in one spot the darkness it-
self was moving-yes the darkness

 itesplf

see that bill

i saw it and the next instant i
saw two great eyes eyes that were
watching us-and moving

chapter 

gogrugron

they were visible for a second or
two only-those great eyes burn-
ing with a greenish fire

where did they go exclaimed
rhodes

and said i what can it be
an ape-bat

that is no ape-bat

he turned to narkus

loopmuke  he queried

no it was not a loopmuke but
what it was neither narkus panto-
mime nor drorathusas could tell us

i dont think milton said
that they know what it is them-
selves  

there i cried whirling round
theres that other thing again-the
thing behind us

i heard nothing

i heard something i tell you
that mystery with the eyes is not the
drome



 only thing that is watching us watch-
 ing us and waiting

  some moments passed perhaps
minutes in expectant waiting our
glances incessantly darting about the
cavern through which the light-mist
was moving in troubled writhing
streams the nebulous spectral glow
of it seeming to enhance the fearsome
gloom of that dreadful place

  i see nothing rhodes said at
last and the cavern is as silent as
a tomb

  but we are seen and if we
dont get out of this it may be our
tomb

  i dont think its so bad as that
but the dromans are signing to us to
come on-let us hope to a place more
pleasant than this one  

  i had turned to quit the spot my
look however lingering in that direc-
tion whence had come those low mys-
terious sounds-a direction right op-
posite to that in which the moving
eyes had shone and scarcely had i
taken a step forward when i fetched
up cried out and pointed

     see that see it moving   

  a large fungous tree its form one
indescribably grotesque was quiver-
ing it began to shake violently
some heavy body hidden from our
eyes was moving there-moving to-
ward us

  of a sudden the tree was thrust
far over there was a squashy sick-
ening sound then down it came the
spot where it fell involved in a cloud
of phosphorescence which thinned
and faded in the air like dust or mist
as it settles

  shades of the gorgons i cried
what is in there

  a sound from rhodes turned me
round on the instant

  the eyes again he cried
there they are have we at last
got into dantes inferno itself

  i was beginning to think that we
had got into something worse

  yes there the eyes were-nearer
this time and yet the thing itself
was hidden in the shadows

  rhodes raised his revolver rested
it on his left arm took careful aim
and fired

  the report seemed to bellow like
thunder through the cavern there
was a scream from the dromans none
of whom save drorathusa had ever
heard a firearm before and i doubt
that even drorathusa knew what had
killed her demon on the instant
whilst the report of the weapon and
the cry of the dromans were ringing
in our ears came another sound-
came a shriek high piercing un-
earthly one that seemed to arrest
and curdle the very blood in our
hearts

  it sank ceased but almost
instantly it came again rose until
the air seemed to quiver to the sound

  the effect upon the dromans was
most sudden and pronounced

  a nameless fear and horror seized
upon me as i saw it

  they started from the spot as if
in a panic signing to us with frantic
gestures to follow

  i started but rhodes for some in-
explicable reason stood there his
look fixed on the spot whence came
those horrible demoniacal shrieks
the eyes had disappeared but in
almost that very instant that i
turned they shone again i gazed at
them as though in fascinated hor-
ror forgetting for the moment that
there was something behind me

  up the eyes rose a black thing
was visible there in the darkness
but its shape was amorphous mys-
terious up the eyes rose seeming to
dilate and the fire in them grew
brighter and brighter became so hor-
ribly unearthly that i began to won-
der if i were going insane the eyes
swayed swayed back and forth for
some moments then gave a sudden
lurch into darkness the shrieks
broke then came again more lior-


weird tales

rible if that were possible than be-
fore

  come on i cried starting
for heavens sake lets get out of
this or i  go mad  

    what in the world   said rhodes
reluctantly turning to follow can
it be

  lets get out of this hellish place
-before its too late remember
there is something behind us maybe
things in other directions too
well said rhodes complacently
as he followed along in my wake
we have our revolvers

  revolvers just see what your
revolver has done a revolver is
only a revolver while that thing-
who knows what that monster is  
the dromans know-or think
that they do

  and look at the dromans fear
has them did you ever see fear like
that before see how they are sign-
ing to us to come on even drora-
thusa is shaken to the very soul  
after all tis no wonder bill
that she is those shrieks how can
it continue to shriek and shriek like
that

  ere long we had come up with the
dromans who at once quickened
their pace on we went casting ap-
prehensive glances into the gloom
about us the frightful sounds sank
as we moved onward they became
faint fainter still and at last to my
profound thankfulness were no long-
er to be heard even when we paused
to listen

  if that said i during one of
these pauses is a good sample of
what we are to have here in drome
then i wish that instead of coming
here i had stepped into a den of
cobras or something  

  drorathusas eyes were upon me
as i ceascd speaking she raised a
hand and pointed in the direction
whence we had come

   gogrugron she said

 and i saw fear and horror un-

utterable well up in her eyes as she
said it

chapter 

lepraylya

oteadily we made our way along
 and downward the light-streams
were increasing in volume the lumin-
osity becoming stronger and strong-
er the vegetation more abundant
the weird shapes larger and more un-
earthly than ever the silence was
broken by the drone of insects-crea-
tures meet inhabitants forsooth for
a place so indescribably strange and
dreadful

  the cavern we were following was
very tortuous our route even more
so what with the twists and turns
which we had to make in order to
get through that fantasmagoria of
fungal things i do not mean to say
that all of those growths were hor-
rible but most of them were and
some were as repulsive to the touch
as they were to the sight

  as we toiled our way through
them my heart was replete with dire
apprehension i could not banish the
horror of those great burning eyes
the horror of those shrieks which
perhaps were still ringing out what
if we were suddenly to find ourselves
face to face with one of those mon-
sters or more than one here in this
nightmare forest

  gogrugron gogrugron what on
earth was that monstrosity known to
the dromans as a gogrugron f well
most certainly i was not desirous of
obtaining first-hand knowledge upon
that interesting item for the great
science of natural history

  at length the light no longer lay
in streams and rifts in the darkness
but the darkness instead lay in
streams through the light the dro-
mans quickened their already hurried
pace and there were exclamations of
drome drome
drome



  drome echoed milton rhodes
i wonder what we are going to
find

  something wonderful said i
or something worse perhaps than
anything that we have seen

  rhodes laughed and i saw drora-
thusa narkus was leading the way
turn and send a curious glance in
our direction

  well i added anything to get
out of this horrible forest of fungi

  some minutes passed perhaps only
fifteen perhaps a half-hour of a
sudden the great tunnel now as light
as a place on a sunless day gave a
sharp turn to the right a glad cry
broke from the hypogeans

  drome drome they cried

  we all hurried forward

  look i said as we reached the
turn   the mouth the mouth the
tunnel ends

  there but two hundred feet or so
away was the great yawning mouth
of it-nothing visible through the
opening but light pearly opalescent
light mystic beautiful

  drome cried delphis clapping
her hands

  a few moments and we were
standing at the entrance gazing out
over the weird and beautiful scene

  drome

  i turned at the sound and saw
drorathusa her figure and mien in-
effably sibylline and majestic point-
ing out over the strange landscape
her eyes on the face of milton rhodes

  drome she said again

  drome echoed milton then
to me i wonder bill what this
drome really is and i have an idea
that this is only the outskirts that we
see  can we at last be near our
journeys end or is that end still far
away

  who can tell this place seems
to be a wilderness  

  yes a forest primeval

  what said i are we destined
to find down there

  things stranger bill than ex-
plorer ever found anywhere in that
strange world above us  

  no gogrugrons i hope

  rhodes laughed

   gogrugron said drorathusa

  and i saw that horror and fear
again in her eyes

  the cavern had come out high up
on a broken jagged wall which went
beetling up for hundreds of feet up
to the roof which arched away over
the landscape before us we were
fully half a thousand feet above the
floor which was a mass of luxuriant
tropical forest glimpses were caught
of a stream down to the left perhaps
the one which we had followed for so
long i judged the place to be more
than a mile wide rhodes however
that it was perhaps not quite a mile
in the widest part down this enor-
mous cavern the eye could range for
three or four miles at which distance
the misty light drew its veil over the
forest the dark walls and the roof
arching across

  at times the light quivered and
shook and there were strange flicker-
ings and dartings of opalescent
streaks through it-streaks ineffably
beautiful and yet strangely enough
terrible too terrible as the blades of
plunging swords in hands savage and
murderous

 once more drorathusa raised a
hand and pointed into the misty dis-
tance

  lepraylya she said

 again her eyes were on milton
rhodes and as she spoke that name
i saw in those wondrous orbs of hers
the strangest look i do believe that
i have ever seen i wondered if
rhodes too saw it i found his eyes
upon drorathusa but there was in
them so abstracted an expression
that i believed his thoughts were far
away and that he had not noticed
when i turned to drorathusa again
it was to find that the strange look
was gone

woman was try as i would yet i

  he drew forth his note-book and
pencil and handed them to drora-
thusa pronouncing as she took them
that mysterious name leprayl-
ya

  a few strokes with the pencil and
drorathusa had given us the answer

  you see bill said rhodes
smiling a woman-undoubtedly
too the queen

  drorathusas sibylline look was
upon him once more-and she did
not smile

chapter 

face to face

we found the wall even more
broken and savage than it had
appeared from the entrance it was
almost destitute of vegetation a cir-
cumstance that contributed not a lit-
tle to the difficulties of the descent
indeed making our way down over
those pitching naked rocks was a
ticklish unpleasant business i want
to tell you-at times really precari-
ous

  we had halted to rest above one of
these difficult spots and everyone was
either seated or leaning against the
rock when of a sudden milton who
was nearest the edge arose and point-
ed pointed down and off to the right

  hello said he whats that

  all of us arose moved forward and
looked

  where i asked

  down there by that strange

clump of sycadaceous trees but tis
gone now

 what was it

  i havent the faintest idea bill
but there was something there some-
thing moving and if i were
imaginative i would probably say
that it was watching us that the
moment i arose and pointed it glided
back to the concealment of the trees

  well did it

  it certainly seemed to do so
bill

  i peered down there again but i
could not see anything moving there
was silence for some moments the
dromans stood watching waiting
stood expectant puzzled

  oh well rhodes said turning
a quizzical look in my direction and
then to the face of drorathusa we
must expect to find live things in that
forest  

  i saw drorathusas eyes fixed up-
on his face then a few moments
after he ceased speaking return to
the clump of cycads

 live things said i there
may be things in this place of mys-
tery more terrible than any live
thing

  come bill come it cant be so
bad as you think it or our dromans
wouldnt be here i wish he added
i knew what that thing is that i
saw  

  hello i cried the next moment
my look raised up to the vaulted roof
what does that mean good heaven
what next

  the light which was brightest up
along the roof-in fact it seemed
pressed up against the rock canopy
like glowing diaphanous mist-was
changing fading the wonderful
opalescence of it was disappearing
before our eyes

 of a sudden the spot where we
stood was involved in a gloom
strange indescribable unearthly up
above the light-mist was quivering
and flickering pale and dreadful
drome



  what on earth is it i said

  queer place this said milton
rhodes

  what can it mean

  he did not answer he sent a
questioning look toward drorathusa
and her companions mine followed
the faces of the dromans seemed to
glimmer ghostlike in the thickening
awful darkness upon those pale
features however was no discover-
able sign of alarm uneasiness even

 the gloom deepened pitchy
darkness came down with a rush
far away and up along the roof
there were pale fliekerings and flash-
es then the light burst out so sud-
den and so strong that pain shot
through the eyes

  came a cry and i turned to see
drorathusa pointing pointing down
toward the cycads

  there it is bill said milton
  there it is again see it moving   

  i saw it but for a fleeting moment
only and i thought i saw some-
thing else

  nearer this time rhodes told
me

  it is moving over i said to
lie in wait for us and unless im
much deceived it isnt alone

 hum said rhodes queer
place bill to go into our hypo-
geans dont seem to know what to
make of this apparition

  they were conversing in low tones
casting searching apprehensive looks
along the ragged margin of the for-
est

  the gloom was falling again
denser and denser it grew about us
fainter more and more dreadful be-
came those distant fliekerings the
stillness was utter terrible there
was not the gentlest movement of air
the light gave a last faint angry
gleam and went out altogether

  abruptly from out of the dark-
ness a voice came sounding and
though i knew that the voice was
drorathusas i started violently and

almost gave a cry i pressed the but-
ton and the rays of the lamp flashed
out lighting up the spot and show-
ing the tall figure of drorathusa with
arms extended upward in some mys-
tic invocation the others were
kneeling and the words that drora-
thusa spoke were echoed as it were
in their low responsive voices it
was a strange scene-the dark savage
masses of rock the tall sibylline fig-
ure of the woman the kneeling forms
of the others and we two men from
the sunlit world looking on in wonder
and in awe

  minutes passed the wondrous
eery voice of drorathusa never
ceased though there were moments
when those echoing voices were silent

  look far away there was a
faint ghostly flicker another and
another brighter they became and
brighter still at last opalescent soon
rocks and forest the whole weird
landscape was again bathed in the
mystic pearly light

  what in the world i said was
it

  an eclipse smiled rhodes

  queer place this  

  queer place cant you hit an-
other tune you dont have to keep
telling me that this is a queer place
i am not likely to forget that fact
and i wonder if these eclipses are
a frequent phenomenon certainly
i hope that they are not

  i wish that i could tell you
bill

  and i added that forest
when the light goes must be a queer
place truly-gosh im catching it
from you but i  tell you what i
wouldnt like to find myself in the
depths of those woods face to face
with a loopmuke or a gogrugron or
something and in that instant have
the darkness come down  

  it would be rather unpleasant i
fancy but unfortunately our likes
or our dislikes are not likely to alter
in any way the scheme of things


weird tales

  the dromans all standing now
were singing a low and sweet song of
thanksgiving and gladness yes so
sweet were the tones that they seemed
to linger in the air for some
moments even after the song had
ceased

  we east our looks along the margin
of the forest but not a single glimpse
was caught of that mysterious object
or objects that we had seen moving
down there

  it was patent that the dromans
knew no more what to make of that
apparition than we did ourselves and
that they looked forward with no
little apprehension to our entry into
those trees

  the descent was resumed were
eyes somewhere below watching our
every movement i feared that it
was indeed so and as i well knew
every other member of our little band
feared it too there was nothing
however that we could do except
descend and face the issue to turn
aside would be futile for the watch-
er or the watchers would turn aside
also to meet us	-

tjre long we reached the talus and

   our troubles were then over-
that is as regards the descent but
heaven only knew what troubles were
awaiting us somewhere in that for-
est to which we were now drawing so
very near as we made our way
down over the rcck-fragments amidst
which shrubs and stunted trees were
growing more than once did we
pause and send keen searching looks
and glances into the silent recesses
of that mysterious wood some of
those sylvan depths were enshadowed
gloomy others were pervaded with
the strong transparent light-mist-
the objects involved in which cast no
shadows

  at the foot of the talus almost be-
neath the branches of the great palm-
trees there was a pause

  now for it said rhodes solemn-
ly 

  the dromans were clustered to-
gether in earnest but laconic dia-
logue their eyes employed the while
in a keen scrutiny of the forest aisles
and recesses before its and on either
hand

  insects were in the air about us
one or two shadowy butterflies flitted
past and that was all not a leaf
stirred the air was without the
slightest movement no song no call
of a bird broke the silence which
seemed to press down upon us and
about us as though it were a tangible
thing it was as if the spot the
forest itself had never known either
the voice or the movement of any
sentient thing but somewhere in
that forest hidden and close at hand
there was something sentient-some-
thing in all likelihood watching us
watching us and waiting waiting
for what or came the sudden
thought even now it was stealing to-
ward the place where we stood

  this suspense said i to myself
is simply awful-as terrible even
as that we knew when moving across
the bridge 

  drorathusa turned to us and point-
ed in a rather vague direction out in-
to the trees

  narranawnzee she said

  they plan to strike that stream
said milton

  i pray heaven i told him that
we live to see it

  whereupon rhodes laughed out-
right-the effect of the sudden sound
curious and startling so great was
the tension of our nerves

  	 one would think gloomy face 
said he that you had just issued
from the cave of trophonius and
he never smiled again 

  i have an idea grinning shaky
knees i retorted that we have
got ourselves into a place more awful
than any cave of trophonius i
dont blink thats all
drome



  nor bill do i said milton
soberly you know id feel more
at ease if it wasnt for the presence
of the ladies why did they come on
a journey so hazardous and so ter-
rible

  how often had we wondered that
we didnt know the ladies of drome

  we at once got in motion-narkus
and rhodes in advance drorathusa
just behind them then delphis and
siris whilst thumbra and i brought
up the rear this disposition of our
little party was as drorathusa her-
self had desired it and she had been
at some pains to impress upon rhodes
and me though there was no neces-
sity for that the expediency of keep-
ing our weapons ready at any instant
for action

  on we went deeper and deeper in-
to the wood strange forms of trop-
ical vegetation strange flowers and
insects were everywhere how inter-
esting we should have found the
place but there was that thing
somewhere hidden watching us per-
haps-following

  came a sharp exclamation a dull
sound from above but it was only a
bird a thing of silver and gold
launching itself from off a branch of
one of the trees which we were ap-
proaching away it went sailing
lovely as a vision from fairyland
and disappeared amongst the tree-
trunks and foliage

  five minutes or so passed an-
other sound an exclamation from
drorathusa and the party came to
a sudden halt

  everyone had heard it-a clear
unmistakable but inexplicable sound
from behind we were being fol-
lowed 

  we stood listening for some mo-
ments waiting but the sound did
not come again save for the low
melancholy drone of insects the spot
was as silent as a tomb

  we resumed our advance every
sense on the alert a few moments
passed and then we heard it this
time it was off to the right almost
abreast of us it seemed

  we waited but nothing was seen
nothing was heard

  we had advanced but twenty or
thirty feet when a sudden gloom in-
volved the forest the scene on the
instant turned weird unearthly
this however was but for a few
seconds then came the light the
advance was at once resumed but
we had gone only a short distance
when the gloom came once more grew
so dense that we had to come to a
halt

  it lifted just as i was on the
point of switching on my light then
like a bolt came utter darkness and
even as the darkness fell there was a
velvety sound and a faint rustling
from amongst the foliage beside us
with frantic haste i sought and
pressed the light-switch at the same
instant rhodes flashed on his light
a cry of horror broke from me
there thrust over the top of a great
log and but a few yards distant was
a long snaky head with a pair of
great blazing eyes fixed upon me

  we were face to face at last

chapter 

another

t jerked out my revolver took swift
aim right between those great
blazing eyes and fired

  there was a fearful roar which
seemed to end in a scream and the
long snaky head and neck no more
of the animal had been visible dis-
appeared

  good work bill applauded
rhodes

  but he had spoken too soon hard-
ly had the words left his lips when
the monster came a dark form with


weird

tales

a gleam of something white rose in-
to the air and came driving straight
toward us i sprang aside and turned
to fire but did not do so for fear of
hitting the dromans or rhodes
there was a heavy sickening thud a
piercing shriek from drorathusa the
sound of rending cloth the mon-
ster had her

  i leaped toward it and emptied the
revolver into its side whilst narkus
and tlxumbra sent each an arrow in-
to the body that of the former was
driven with such force that the
feathered end of the shaft must have
been half-way through the lungs
and down the thing fell dead though
still quivering there in our very
midst

  i turned and hurried to drora-
thusa rhodes was already beside
her the claws of the monster had
ripped her dress from the thigh
down literally into ribbons strange-
ly enough the flesh had escaped even
a scratch

  drorathusa was badly shaken and
little wonder forsooth it had been
a miraculous escape from terrible
injury from a most horrible death
a few moments however and she
was as composed as though nothing
had happened truly there was
much to admire in this extraordinary
woman

  rhodes and i turned and examined
the body now lying quite still it
was that of an enormous cat strict-
ly speaking it was not i suppose a
cat it was not like anything that
we had ever seen or heard of but
a cat i shall call it not knowing what
other word to use the head was
long and of an aspect strikingly re-
pulsively snakelike this reptilian
resemblance was enhanced by the
heads being absolutely destitute of
hair save for the vibrissas which
were really enormous the body was
a dull shadowy gray and most
curiously mottled the breast and
the belly were snowy white

  hum said milton rhodes a
strange and terrible creature bill
this wilderness must be a real one
when we find a carnivore like this-
and goodness only knows what others
-subsisting in it

  yes and with such creatures
in the woods our journey through
them is likely to prove an interesting
one  

  oh well said rhodes we have
our revolvers and the dromans have
their bows and arrows to say nothing
of the swords and they know how
to use them too

  and that reminds be i told
him i havent reloaded my blun-
derbuss

  save those shells bill

  what for

  so we can reload them

 reload them do you think
well be able to do that in this world
called drome

 why not

 but how-

  rhodes turned like a flash

  hear that he said by the
great nimrod another one

  the darkness still lay impenetrable
pitchy we flashed our lights into
the trees this way and that all about
us but no eyes were seen gleaming
at us nothing moving save the shad-
ows and not the faintest sound was
heard

  the dromans were listening intent-
ly but it was patent that they had
not heard that sound which had
whirled rhodes about nor had i
heard it myself

  sure i queried that there
was a sound

  i certainly thought that i heard
something  

  	 look  i cried pointing upward
through the openings in the foli-
age pale fliekerings of light were to
be seen
drome



  thank goodness rhodes said
well soon have it again

  and we soon did-the strong mys-
tic and yet strangely misty light
pervading the mysterious and dread-
ful wood the flickerings and flashes
overhead soon opalescent and beau-
tiful as ever

  we at once narkus and thumbra
having drawn their arrows from the
body of the cat left that spot to
make our way deeper and deeper in-
to that weird forest which harbored
enemies so terrible and so treacher-
ous

  why i queried didnt we
camp up there on the rocks where it
would have been impossible save in
darkness for anything to approach
us unseen we had made a days
good journey and here wre have gone
and left a place of safety to camp
somewhere in this horrible wood
what returned rhodes would
that have been but postponing the
inevitable for into these trees we
should have had to go sooner or
later and the thing would have been
watching for us just the same as
you say wre had made a good journey
for the day wrell arent we making
it better   

  it isnt ended yet

  this place after all bill may
not be so bad as it seems  

  well there is one consolation i
remarked there is no danger of our
starving to death in this lovely
dantes inferno look at all the fruit
and nuts and things

  yes from that point of view
the place is a veritable garden of the
hesperides  

at length wre reached the stream
considerably larger than i had
expected to find it at this point
where we struck it the water was
deep the current a gentle one the
rich forest growth hung out over the
surface for some distance there

was a soft rustling of leaves for some
of the branches dipped into the water
and were swaying to and fro this
and the faint melancholy whisper of
the gliding element were all that
broke the heavy deathlike stillness
it wtas a placid lovely scene

  the attainment of this their ob-
jective seemed to give our dromans
much pleasure but save for the fact
that there was now no danger of our
perishing of thirst i could not see
that we were any better off than we
had been

  i thought that this would be the
end of our march now a long one
indeed but the dromans merely
paused then started down the
stream and of course along with
them went rhodes and myself at
times we had literally to force our
way through the dense and tangled
undergrowth then we would be mov-
ing through lovely aisles-

and many a walk traversed

  of stateliest covert cedar pine or
    palm

  we pushed on for perhaps two
miles never moving far from the
stream and then made camp in a
beautiful open spot over which
however the great branches formed
an unbroken canopy of feaves

  a guard wras arranged for the
night rhodes had the first watch

  it wras during my vigil that it came
-a sudden fierce frightful scream
which awoke every member of our
little party it came from some-
where down the river and was re-
plete with terror and agony a sound
that made the very air quiver and
throb it seemed human and yet i
told myself that it simply could not
be and then it ceased as suddenly
as it had come and all was still
again save for the gentle sad whis-
pering of the water

  what i exclaimed my voice
however low and guarded was it


weird tales

it sounded human but i know that
that sound did not come from the
throat of a man or a woman

  it wasnt human bill what it
was-well that seems to be a mystery-
even to the dromans

  i turned and saw drorathusa who
had just issued from the tent stand-
ing beside narkus and engaged in
hurried and whispered dialogue the
troubled looks which she incessantly
directed into the forest in that quar-
ter whence had come that fearful
sound advertising dread and some-
thing for which i can not find a
name

    evidently   rhodes observed
they know but little more about this
place and the things in it than we do
ourselves  

  and that is virtually nothing
did you he asked suddenly
hear something else

    something else  when   
something besides that seream
and while it was filling the air-and
just afterward

  i heard nothing else did you
  i believe that i did

 what

  i can not say was his answer
i wish that i could

  well said i all we know is
that there is something sneaking or
prowling about in this wood that it
has just got a victim and that in all
probability it means to get one of us
-or all

  rhodes nodded rather rueful of
visage

  we were fortunate enough he
said to kill one monster i wonder
if we shall be as fortunate the sec-
ond time for there is another wait-
ing perhaps-biding its time

  an icy shudder went through me
  another yes but another whatf

chapter 
a scream and-silence

t am afraid that no one slept very

  well after that

  it was about  o clock when we left
that place and i confess that i was
more uneasy more troubled than i
would have eared to acknowledge
for we were headed toward the spot
-at any rate in the direction-
whence had come that frightful
scream what would we find there
or would we find anything

  we did

  we had gone about an eighth of a
mile the disposition of our little
party was as it had been the day be-
fore-rhodes and narkus that is
were in the lead followed by drora-
thusa then came delphis and siris
whilst thumbra and myself formed
the rear-guard had my own wishes
in the matter been followed rhodes
and i would have been together the
formation assumed was as i believe i
have mentioned the one that drora-
thusa desired the idea of course
was to have the front and the rear
protected each by one of the myste-
rious weapons of the mysterious
strange-men-weapons undoubtedly
far more formidable in the imagina-
tion of drorathusa and her compan-
ions than they were in reality

  certainly our revolvers were in
every way excellent weapons but i
could not help wishing that they
carried a more powerful bullet

  as has been said we had proceeded
about a furlong the dense and
tangled undergrowth had forced us
away from the stream to a distance
of perhaps three hundred feet

  at the moment a sound had fetched
me up and my exclamation had
brought the party to a sudden halt

  what is it rhodes asked

  we are being followed f
drome



  he made no immediate response to
that dire intelligence we all stood
listening waiting but a silence per-
vaded the forest as deep as though
it had never since the day of crea-
tion been broken by the faintest
pulsation of sound

  then after some moments rhodes
asked sure bill that we are being
followed

  yes i tell you that i know that
we are

  well said he turning slowly
i dont see that we can do anything
about it save keep a sharp lookout
and so  we go  

  whereupon he and the others start-
ed i had turned to follow when
that sound low and mysterious as
before stopped me in my tracks
and in that very instant came an-
other-a sharp interjection from
rhodes instantaneously followed by
a scream the short piercing scream
of a woman

  i should have explained that we
were in a dense growth of fern a
growth some ten or twelve feet in
height-a meet place indeed for an
ambuscade overhead too the
branches met and intertangled-af-
fording an excellent place for a bald-
headed cat or some other arboreal
monster to lie in wait and drop or
spring upon any human or brute
passing below

  now as i whirled to that exclama-
tion and scream-the danger there
behind forgotten in what was so im-
minent before-it was to find to my
indescribable fear and horror that
my companions every single one of
them had vanished

  and that horror and fear which
chilled my heart were enhanced by
the fact that before me where
rhodes and the dromans must be
there was no agitation amongst the
ferns not the slightest movement
amongst them i was alone alone in

that fearful place of dense conceal-
ing vegetation of silence and mys-
tery but no they were there my
companions right there before me
the ferns hid them that was all
but why were they so still what
had happened that exclamation
that scream-the silence that had
fallen

  it has taken some space to set this
down but it must not be imagined
that the space itself during which i
stood there was a long one it was
in fact very brief it was no more
i suppose than five or six seconds
then i was moving forward through
the crushed ferns as swiftly as was
consistent with caution and of
course with the revolver gripped
ready for instant action

  i had covered perhaps three yards
had reached the point where the way
crushed through the fem-growth
turned sharp to the left to pass be-
tween two great tree-trunks then it
was that i heard it-a low rustling
sound and close at hand

 something was moving there-
moving toward me

chapter 
gorgonic horror

 lmost that very instant i heard
it that low rustling sound made
by something moving through as i
thought the fern growth ceased my
companions what had happened
to them

  i began moving forward every
second that passed enhancing that
horrible fear which chilled my heart
for each step took me nearer to
though not directly toward that spot
from which had come that mysterious
sound

  just as i was passing between those
great tree-trunks came a sound that
fetched me up in my tracks came a
sudden low voice oh bill


weird tales

  i gave a smothered cry and dashed
forward rhodes was safe at any
rate he was alive a second or two
and i burst from the fern-growth
surprize amazement brought me up
and the next instant an indescribable
horror had me in its grip

  the surprize the amazement will
be explained when i say that there
before me stood my companions
every one of them safe and sound
there they stood moveless and silent
as so many statues gazing as though
held in a baleful charm upon that
horror before them rhodes was the
only one that moved as i burst into
the scene

  i wondered bill why you didnt
come

  and i wondered why you all
were so silent-after that exclamation
and scream i understand it now

  shuddering i pointed with my
alpenstock

  in the name of the gorgons what
is that

  i wish that i knew bill

  a silence of some seconds followed
and then i remembered-that rust-
ling sound

  i turned and another shudder
went through me drorathusa was
standing very near that spot from
which that rustling sound must have
come

  what is there i asked point-
ing

  rhodes whirled in the direction i
indicated

 where

    in the ferns-behind drorathusa
i heard something in there some-
thing moving

 when

  some moments ago-just before
you called

  a wan smile flitted across the face
of milton rhodes

 that was drorathusa herself
moving through that tangle of
flowers  

  but i tell you that it was mov-
ing toward me

  it was drorathusa said rhodes
you only thought that the sound
was moving toward you away from
us no bill it was drorathusa
there was no other sound to that i
can swear

  so my imagination had tricked me
and yet how could i be sure that it
had for in such a moment with
such a sight before him rhodes him-
self might have been the one de-
ceived in that case any instant
might see death come leaping into
our very midst

  who gave that scream i asked
one of the girls when we broke
out of the ferns and she saw that
delphis i believe

  this turned me again to that thing
of horror no wonder that that pierc-
ing terrible scream had broken from
the girl

  jthe spot into which we had stepped
was for a distance of perhaps one
hundred and fifty feet almost free
from undergrowth the twisted
trunks and branches had a gnarled
and savage aspect the light had
faded and what with the gloom that
had fallen and the weird shapes of
the trees and the branches the scene
was a strange and terrible one a
fitting setting truly for what we saw
there in the midst of it

  for sixty feet or so distant still
white and lifeless naked save for a
skin spotted something like a leop-
ards about the waist the toes four
or five feet from the ground hung
the body of a man

  that itself was horrible enough
but what we saw up in the branches
above-how i shudder as that pic-
ture rises before me it was a shape
amorphous monstrous of mottled
drome



green and brown with splotches of
something whitish bluish

  there were splotches too upon
the branches and upon the ground
beneath it was like blood that whit-
ish bluish stuff and indeed that is
what it was in the midst of that
amorphous mass were two great eyes
but they never moved were fixed and
glassy one of the higher branches
had been broken though not clean
from the trunk and wound around
this branch the end of which had
fallen upon those in which the mon-
ster rested were what i at first took
to be enormous serpents they were
in fact tentacula there was a third
tentacle it hung straight down and
it was from this the coils wrapped
around the neck that the body of the
unfortunate man hung white and
lifeless like a victim of the hang-
mans noose

  a tree-octopus i cried

  i suppose one might call it that
only it seems to have but three
tentacles and that scream we heard
last night-we know now what it
was  

  i shuddered

  no wonder we thought that the
sound was unhuman-in the grip of
that thing the coils around his neck
so near and we never stirred to his
help

  because we never dreamed and
had we known bill we could not
have saved him life would have been
extinct crushed out of him before
we could have got here and cut him
down  

  i thought of some dreadful
things said i but never of a
monster like that  

  a queer place a horrible place
bill said milton rhodes glancing
a little nervously about him but
come  

  he started forward the dromans
hung back but i moved along after

him whereupon the others followed
though with great apparent reluc-
tance and horror

  what i dont understand bill
is this what happened

  why the poor fellow was pass-
ing beneath the branches the octopus
thrust down its tentacle wound it
around the victims neck and started
to pull him up

  all that is very clear but then
what happened-to the octopus
the limb to which the monster
had attached itself broke under the
added weight and down it came
crashing into those branches in which
we see it

  that too is clear said rhodes
but what killed the thing the
fall itself it seems to me could not
have done so

  the next moment we halted a few

still white body of the droman

  i see it now said rhodes point-
ing as the monster came down it
was impaled upon that swordlike stub
of a branch see it protruding up-
ward from the horrible body  

  this there could be no doubt was
what had happened and that gor-
gonic horror in the shock of the fall
and its impalement even in its death
throes had never loosed the grip on
its victim

  we cant leave the poor devil
-hanging like that i said

  of course not and to give him
burial will mean the loss of time
probably more precious even than we
think this is a wood horrible as any
that dante ever found himself in
we must risk it we cant leave
him like that or the body lying on
the ground for the beasts to devour
rhodes and i still had our ice-
picks and we at once divested our-
selves of the packs and started the
grave and as we worked try as i
would i could not shake it from me-

it took three strokes to cleave his
sword through the tentacle along it
ran two rows of suckers like those of

grip upon the victims neck we could
not remove the severed end of the

weird story reprint

 markheim

 by robert louis stevenson

es said the dealer our
windfalls are of various
kinds some customers are
ignorant and then i touch a dividend
on my superior knowledge some
are dishonest and here he held up
the candle so that the light fell
strongly on his visitor and in that
case he continued i profit by my
virtue

 markheim had but just entered
from the daylight streets and his
eyes had not yet grown familiar with
the mingled shine and darkness in
the shop at these pointed words
and before the near presence of the
flame he blinked painfully and
looked aside

  the dealer chuckled you come
to me on christmas day he re-
sumed when you know that i am
alone in my house put up my shut-
ters and make a point of refusing
business well you will have to pay
for that you will have to pay for my

loss of time when i should be bal-
ancing my books you will have to
pay besides for a kind of manner
that i remark in you today very
strongly i am the essence of discre-
tion and ask no awkward questions
but when a customer can not look me
in the eye he has to pay for it   the
dealer once more chuckled and then
changing to his usual business voice
though still with a note of irony
you can give as usual a clear ac-
count of how you came into the pos-
session of the object he continued
still your uncles cabinet a re-
markable collector sir

  and the little pale round-shoul-
dered dealer stood almost on tiptoe
looking over the top of his gold spec-
tacles and nodding his head with
every mark of disbelief markheim
returned his gaze with one of infin-
ite pity and a touch of horror

  this time said he you are in
error i have not come to sell but
markheim



to buy i have no curios to dispose
of my uncles cabinet is bare to the
wainscot even were it still intact i
have done well on the stock ex-
change and should more likely add
to it than otherwise and my errand
today is simplicity itself i seek a
christmas present for a lady he
continued waxing more fluent as he
struck into the speech he had pre-
pared and certainly i owe you
every excuse for thus disturbing you
upon so small a matter but the
thing was neglected yesterday i
must produce my little compliment
at dinner and as you very well
know a rich marriage is not a thing
to be neglected

  there followed a pause during
whieh the dealer seemed to weigh
this statement incredulously the
ticking of many clocks among the
curious lumber of the shop and the
faint rushing of the cabs in a near
thoroughfare filled up the interval
of silence

  well sir said the dealer be
it so you are an old customer after
all and if as you say you have the
chance of a good marriage far be it
from me to be an obstacle here is a
nice thing for a lady now he went
on this hand glass-fifteenth cen-
tury warranted comes from a good
collection too but i reserve the
name in the interests of my custom-
er who was just like yourself my
dear sir the nephew and sole heir of
a remarkable collector

  the dealer while he thus ran on
in his dry and biting voice had
stooped to take the object from its
place and as he had done so a
shock had passed through markheim
a start both of hand and foot a sud-
den leap of many tumultuous pas-
sions to the face it passed as swift-
ly as it came and left no trace be-
yond a certain trembling of the hand
that now received the glass

  a glass he said hoarsely and
then paused and repeated it more

clearly a glass for christmas -
surely not

  and why not cried the dealer
why not a glass

  markheim was looking upon him
with an indefinable expression you
ask me why not he said why
look here-look in it-look at your-
self do you like to see it no nor
i-nor any man

  the little man had jumped back
when markheim had so suddenly con-
fronted him with the mirror but
now perceiving there was nothing
worse on hand he chuckled your
future lady sir must be pretty hard-
favored said he

  i ask you said markheim for
a christmas present and you give me
this-this damned reminder of years
and sins and follies-this hand-con-
seience did you mean it had you
a thought in your mind tell me

it will be better for you if you do
come tell me about yourself i haz-
ard a guess now that you are in
secret a very charitable man

  the dealer looked closely at his
companion it was very odd mark-
heim did not appear to be laughing
there was something in his face like
an eager sparkle of hope but nothing
of mirth

  what are you driving at the
dealer asked

  not charitable returned the
other gloomily not charitable
not pious not scrupulous unloving
unbeloved a hand to get money a
safe to keep it is that all dear
god man is that all

  i will tell you what it is began
the dealer with some sharpness and
then broke off again into a chuckle
but i see this is a love match of
yours and you have been drinking
the ladys health

ah cried markheim with a
strange curiosity ah have you
been in love tell me about that
i cried the dealer i in love

i never had the time nor have i the


weird tales

time today for all this nonsense will
you take the glass   

  where is the hurry returned
markheim it is very pleasant to
stand here talking and life is so
short and insecure that i would not
hurry away from any pleasure-no
not even from so mild a one as this
we should rather cling cling to what
little we can get like a man at a
cliffs edge every second is a cliff
if you think upon it-a cliff a mile
high-high enough if we fall to
dash us out of every feature of hu-
manity hence it is best to talk pleas-
antly let us talk of each other
why should we wear this mask let
us be confidential who knows we
might become friends

  i have just one word to say to
you said the dealer either make
your purchase or walk out of my
shop  

  true true said markheim
enough fooling to business show
me something else

  the dealer stooped once more this
time to replace the glass upon the
shelf his thin blond hair falling over
his eyes as he did so markheim
moved a little nearer with one hand
in the pocket of his greatcoat he
drew himself up and filled his lungs
at the same time many different emo-
tions were depicted together on his
face-terror horror and resolve
fascination and a physical repulsion
and through a haggard lift of his
upper lip his teeth looked out

  this perhaps may suit ob-
served the dealer and then as he be-
gan to re-arise markheim bounded
from behind upon his victim the
long skewerlike dagger flashed and
fell the dealer struggled like a hen
striking his temple on the shelf and
then tumbled on the floor in a heap

time had some score of small
voices in that shop some stately
and slow as was becoming to their
great age others garrulous and hur-

ried all these told out the seconds
in an intricate chorus of tickings
then the passage of a lads feet
heavily running on the pavement
broke in upon these smaller voices
and startled markheim into the con-
sciousness of his surroundings he
looked about him awfully the candle
stood on the counter its flame sol-
emnly wagging in a draft and by
that inconsiderable movement the
whole room was filled with noiseless
bustle and kept heaving like a sea
the tall shadows nodding the gross
blots of darkness swelling and
dwindling as with respiration the
faces of the portraits and the china
gods changing and wavering like
images in water the inner door
stood ajar and peered into that
leaguer of shadows with a long slit
of daylight like a pointing finger

  from these fear-stricken rovings
markheims eyes returned to the body
of his victim where it lay both
humped and sprawling incredibly
small and strangely meaner than in
life in these poor miserable clothes
in that ungainly attitude the dealer
lay like so much sawdust markheim
had feared to see it and lo it was
nothing and yet as he gazed this
bundle of old clothes and pool of
blood began to find eloquent voices
there it must lie there was none to
work the cunning hinges or direct the
miracle of locomotion-there it must
lie till it was found found ay and
then then would this dead flesh
lift up a cry that would ring over
england and fill the world with the
echoes of pursuit ay dead or not
this was still the enemy time was
that when the brains were out he
thought and the first word struck in-
to his mind time now that the
deed was accomplished-time which
had closed for the victim had become
instant and momentous for the
slayer

  the thought was yet in his mind
when first one and then another
markheim



with every variety of pace and voice
-one deep as the bell from a cathe-
dral turret another ringing on its
treble notes the prelude of a waltz-
the clocks began to strike the hour of
 in the afternoon

  the sudden outbreak of so many
tongues in that dumb chamber stag-
gered him he began to bestir him-
self going to and fro with the candle
beleaguered by moving shadows and
startled to the soul by chance reflec-
tions in many rich mirrors some
of home designs some from venice or
amsterdam he saw his face repeated
and repeated as it were an army of
spies his own eyes met and detected
him and the sound of his own steps
lightly as they fell vexed the sur-
rounding quiet and still as he con-
tinued to fill his pockets his mind ac-
cused him with a sickening iteration
of the thousand faults of his design
he should have chosen a more quiet
hour he should have prepared an
alibi he should not have used a
knife he should have been more cau-
tious and only bound and gagged
the dealer and not killed him he
should have been more bold and
killed the servant also he should
have done all things otherwise poig-
nant regrets weary incessant toiling
of the mind to change what was un-
changeable to plan what was now
useless to be the architect of the ir-
revocable past meanwhile and be-
hind all this activity brute terrors
like the scurrying of rats in a desert-
ed attic filled the more remote
chambers of his brain with riot the
hand of the constable would fall
heavy on his shoulder and his nerves
would jerk like a hooked fish or he
beheld in galloping defile the dock
the prison the gallows and the black
coffin

  terror of the people in the street
sat down before his mind like a be-
sieging army it was impossible he
thought but that some rumor of the
struggle must have reached their ears

and set on edge their curiosity and
now in all the neighboring houses he
divined them sitting motionless and
with uplifted ear-solitary people
condemned to spend christmas dwell-
ing alone on memories of the past
and now startlingly recalled from
that tender exercise happy family
parties struck into silence round the
table the mother still with raised
finger every degree and age and
humor but all by their own hearths
prying and harkening and weaving
the rope that was to hang him some-
times it seemed to him he could not
move too softly the clink of the tall
bohemian goblets rang out loudly
like a bell and alarmed by the big-
ness of the ticking he was tempted
to stop the clocks and then again
with a swift transition of his terrors
the very silence of the place appeared
a source of peril and a thing to
strike and freeze the passer-by and
he would step more boldly and bustle
about among the contents of the shop
and imitate with elaborate bravado
the movements of a busy man at ease
in his own house

  but he was now so pulled about by
different alarms that while one por-
tion of his mind was still alert and
cunning another trembled on the
brink of lunacy one hallucination
in particular took a strong hold on
his credulity the neighbor harken-
ing with white face beside his win-
dow the passer-by arrested by a hor-
rible surmise on the pavement-
these could at worst suspect they
could not know through the brick
walls and shuttered windows only
sounds could penetrate but here
within the house was he alone he
knew he was he had watched the
servant set forth sweethearting in
her poor best out for the day
written in every ribbon and smile
yes he was alone of course and
yet in the bulk of empty house above
him he could surely hear a stir of
delicate footing-he was surely con-


weird tales

scious inexplicably conscious of some
presence ay surely to every room
and comer of the house his imagina-
tion followed it and now it was a
faceless thing and yet had eyes to
see with and again it was a shadow
of himself and yet again behold the
image of the dead dealer reinspired
with cunning and hatred

  at times with a strong effort he
would glance at the open door whieh
still seemed to repel his eyes the
house was tall the skylight small and
dirt the day blind with fog and
the light that filtered down to the
ground story was exceedingly faint
and showed dimly on the threshold of
the shop and yet in that strip of
doubtful brightness did there not
hang waveiing a shadow

  suddenly from the street outside
a very jovial gentleman began to
beat with a staff on the shop-door
accompanying his blows with shouts
and railleries in which the dealer
was continually called upon by name
markheim smitten into ice glanced
at the dead man but no he lay
quite still he was fled away far be-
yond earshot of these blows and
shoutings he was sunk beneath seas
of silence and his name which
would once have caught his notice
above the howling of a storm had
become an empty sound and pres-
ently the jovial gentleman desisted
from his knocking and departed

  here was a broad hint to hurry
what remained to be done to get
lorth from this accusing neighbor-
hood to plunge into a bath of lon-
don multitudes and to reach on the
other side of day that haven of
safety and apparent innocence-his
bed one visitor had come at any
moment another might follow and be
more obstinate to have done the
leed and yet not to reap the profit
vould be too abhorrent a failure the
noney that was now markheims
oncern and as a means to that the
keys

  he glanced over his shoulder at the
open door where the shadow was
still lingering and shivering and
with no conscious repugnance of the
mind yet with a tremor of the belly
he drew near the body of his victim
the human character had quite de-
parted like a suit half-stuffed with
bran the limbs lay scattered the
trunk doubled on the floor and yet
the thing repelled him although
so dingy and inconsiderable to the
eye he feared it might have more
significance to the touch he took the
body by the shoulders and turned it
on its back it was strangely light
and supple and the limbs as if they
had been broken fell into the oddest
postures the face was robbed of all
expression but it was as pale as wax
and shockingly smeared with blood
about one temple that was for
markheim the one displeasing cir-
cumstance it carried him back up-
on the instant to a certain fair day
in a fishers village a gray day a
piping wind a crowd upon the street
the blare of brasses the booming of
drums the nasal voice of a ballad
singer and a boy going to and fro
buried over head in the crowd and
divided between interest and fear
until coming out upon the chief
place of concourse he beheld a booth
and a great screen with pictures
dismally designed garishly colored
brownrigg with her apprentice the
mannings with their murdered guest
weare in the death-grip of thurtell
and a score besides of famous crimes
the thing was as clear as an illusion
he was once again that little boy he
was looking once again and with the
same sense of physical revolt at these
vile pictures he was still stunned by
the thumping of the drums a bar
of that days music returned upon
his memory and at that for the first
time a qualm came over him a
breath of nausea a sudden weakness
of the joints which he must instantly
resist and conquer
markheim



  he judged it more prudent to con-
front than to flee from these consid-
erations  looking the more hardily in
the dead face bending his mind to
realize the nature and greatness of
his crime so little a while ago that
face had moved with every change of
sentiment that pale mouth had spo-
ken that body had been all on fire
with governable energies and now
and by his act that piece of life had
been arrested as the horologist with
interjected finger arrests the beating
of the clock so he reasoned in vain
he could rise to no more remorseful
consciousness the same heart which
had shuddered before the painted
effigies of crime looked on its reality
unmoved at best he felt a gleam of
pity for one who had been endowed
in vain with all those faculties that
can make the world a garden of en-
chantment one who had never lived
and who was now dead but of peni-
tence no not a tremor

  with that shaking himself clear of
these considerations he found the
keys and advanced toward the open
door of the shop outside it had
begun to rain smartly and the sound
of the shower upon the roof had ban-
ished silcnce like some dripping
cavern the chambers of the house
were haunted by an incessant echo-
ing which filled the ear and mingled
with the ticking of the clocks and
as markheim approached the door
he seemed to hear in answer to his
own cautions tread the steps of an-
other foot withdrawing up the stair
the shadow still palpitated loosely on
the threshold he threw a tons
weight of resolve upon his muscles
and drew back the door

  the faint foggy daylight glim-
mered dimly on the bare floor and
stairs on the bright suit of armor
posted halbert in hand upon the
landing and on the dark wood-carv-
ings and framed pictures that hung
against the yellow panels of the wain-
scot so loud was the beating of the

rain through all the house that in
markheims ears it began to be dis-
tinguished into many different
sounds footsteps and sighs the
tread of regiments marching in the
distance the chink of money in the
counting and the creaking of doors
held stealthily ajar appeared to
mingle with the patter of the drops
upon the cupola and the gushing of
the water in the pipes the sense
that he was not alone grew upon him
to the verge of madness on every
side he was haunted and begirt by
presences he heard them moving in
the upper chambers from the shop
he heard the dead man getting to his
legs and as he began with a great
effort to mount the stairs feet fled
quietly before him and followed
stealthily behind if he were but
deaf he thought how tranquilly ho
would possess his soul and then
again and harkening with ever fresh
attention he blessed himself for that
unresting sense which held the out-
posts and stood a trusty sentinel up-
on his life his head turned con-
tinually on his neck his eyes which
seemed starting from their orbits
scouted  every side and on every
side were half-rewarded as with the
tail of something nameless vanishing
the four-and-twenty steps to the first
floor were four-and-twenty agonies

  on that first story the doors stood
ajar three of them like three am-
bushes shaking his nerves like the
throats of cannon he could never
again he felt be sufficiently immured
and fortified from mens observing
eyes he longed to be home girt in by
walls buried among bedclothes and
invisible to all but god and at that
thought he wondered a little recol-
lecting tales of other murderers and
the fear- they were said to entertain
of heavenly avengers it was not so
at least with him he feared the
laws of nature lest in their callous
and immutable procedure they
should preserve some damning evi-


weird tales

clenee of his crime he feared ten-
fold more with a slavish super-
stitious terror some scission in the
continuity of mans experience some
wilful illegality of nature he played
a game of skill depending on the
rules calculating consequence from
cause and what if nature as the de-
feated tyrant overthrew the chess-
board should break the mold of their
succession  the like had befallen
nalopeon so writers said when the
winter changed the time of its ap-
pearance the like might befall
markheim the solid walls might be-
come transparent and reveal his do-
ings like those of bees in a glass hive
the stout planks might yield under
his foot like quicksands and detain
him in their clutch ay and there
were soberer accidents that might de-
stroy him if for instance the house
should fall and imprison him beside
the body of his victim or the house
next door should fly on fire and the
firemen invade him from all sides
these things he feared and in a
sense these things might be called
the hands of god reached forth
against sin but about god himself
he was at ease his act was doubtless
exceptional but so were his excuses
which god knew it was there and
not among men that he felt sure of
justice

xhen he had got safe into the

 	 drawing room and shut the
door behind him he was aware of a
respite from alarms the room was
quite dismantled uncarpeted besides
and strewn with packing cases and
incongruous furniture several great
pier-glasses in which he beheld him-
self at various angles like an actor on
a stage many pictures framed and
unframed standing with their faces
to the wall a fine sheraton side-
board a cabinet of marquetry and a
great old bdd with tapestry hang-
ings the windows opened to the
floor but by great good fortune the

lower part of the shutters had been
closed and this concealed him from
the neighbors here then markheim
drew in a packing case before the
cabinet and began to search among
the keys it was a long business for
there were many and it was irksome
besides for after all there might be
nothing in the cabinet and time was
on the wing but the closeness of
the occupation sobered him with
the tail of his eye he saw the door-
even glanced at it from time to time
directly like a besieged commander
pleased to verify the good estate of
his defenses but in truth he was at
peace the rain falling in the street
sounded natural and pleasant pres-
ently on the other side the notes of
a piano were wakened to the music
of a hymn and the voices of many
children took up the air and words
how stately how comfortable was
the melody how fresh the youthful
voices markheim gave ear to it
smilingly as he sorted out the keys
and his mind was thronged with an-
swerable ideas and images church-
going children and the pealing of the
high organ children afield bathers
by the brookside ramblers on the
brambly common kite-flyers in the
windy and cloud-navigated sky and
then at another cadence of the hymn
back again to church and the somno-
lence of summer sundays and the
high genteel voice of the parson
which he smiled a little to recall
and the painted jacobean tombs and
the dim lettering of the ten com-
mandments in the chancel

  and as he sat thus at once busy
and absent he was startled to his
feet a flash of ice a flash of fire a
bursting gush of blood went over
him and then he stood transfixed and
thrilling a step mounted the stair
slowly and steadily and presently a
hand was laid upon the knob and
the lock clicked and the door opened

  fear held markheim in a vise
what to expect he knew not whether
markheim



the dead man walking or the official
ministers of human justice or some
chance witness blindly stumbling in
to consign him to the gallows but
when a face was thrust into the aper-
ture glanced round the room looked
at him nodded and smiled as if in
friendly recognition and then with-
drew again and the door closed be-
hind it his fear broke loose from his
control in a hoarse cry at the sound
of this the visitant returned

  did you call me he asked
pleasantly and with that he entered
the room and closed the door behind
him

  markheim stood and gazed at him
with all his eyes perhaps there was
a film upon his sight but the out-
lines of the newcomer seemed to
change and waver like those of the
idols in the wavering candle-light of
the shop and at times he thought he
knew him and at times he thought
he bore a likeness to himself and
always like a lump of living terror
there lay in his bosom the conviction
that this thing was not of the earth
and not of god

  and yet the creature had a strange
air of the commonplace as he stood
looking on markheim with a smile
and when he added you are look-
ing for the money i believe it was
in the tones of everyday politeness

  markheim made no answer

  i should warn you resumed the
other that the maid has left her
sweetheart earlier than usual and
will soon be here if mr markheim
be found in this house i need not
describe to him the consequences

  you know me cried the mur-
derer

  the visitor smiled you have
long been a favorite of mine he
said and i have long observed and
often sought to help you

    what are you    cried markheim
the devil

  what i may be returned the

other can not affect the service i
propose to render you

  it can cried markheim it
does be helped by you no never
not by you you do not know me
yet thank god you do not know
me

  i know you replied the visitant
with a sort of kind severity or rather
firmness i know you to the soul

 know me cried markheim
who can do so my life is but a
travesty and slander on myself i
have lived to belie my nature all
men do all men are better than this
disguise that grows about and stifles
them you see each dragged away
by life like one whom bravos have
seized and muffled in a cloak if
they had their own control-if you
could see their faces they would be
altogether different they would shine
out for heroes and saints i am worse
than most myself is more overlaid
my excuse is known tome and god
but had i the time i could disclose
myself

  to me inquired the visitant

  to you before all returned the
murderer i supposed you were
intelligent i thought-since you
exist-you would prove a reader of
the heart and yet you would pro-
pose to judge me by my acts think
of it my acts i was born and i
have lived in a land of giants giants
have dragged me by the wrists since
i was born out of my mother-the
giants of circumstance and you
would judge me by my acts but
can you not look within can you
not understand that evil is hateful
to me can you not see within me
the clear writing of conscience never
blurred by any wilful sophistry al-
though too often disregarded can
you not read me for a thing that
surely must lie common as humanity
-the unwilling sinner

  all this is very feelingly ex-
pressed was the reply but it re-
gards me not these points of con-


weird

tales

sistency are beyond my province
and i care not in the least by what
compulsion you may have been
dragged away so as you are but car-
ried in the right direction but time
flies the servant delays looking in
the faces of the crowd and at the
pictures on the hoardings but still
she keeps moving nearer and re-
member it is as if the gallows itself
were striding toward you through the
christmas streets shall i help you
i who know all shall i tell you
where to find the money

  for what price asked mark-
heim

  i offer you the service for a
christmas gift returned the other

  markheim eould not refrain from
smiling with a kind of bitter triumph
no said he i will take nothing
at your hands if i were dying of
thirst and it was your hand that put
the pitcher to my lips i should find
the courage to refuse it may be
credulous but i will do nothing to
commit myself to evil  

  i have no objection to a death-
bed repentance observed the vis-
itant

  because you disbelieve their
efficacy markheim cried

  i do not say so returned the
other but i look on these things
from a different side and when the
life is done my interest falls the
man has lived to serve me to spread
black looks under color of religion
or to sow tares in the wheat-field as
you do in a course of weak compli-
ance with desire now that he draws
so near to his deliverance he can add
but one act of service-to repent to
die smiling and hus to build up in
confidence and hope the more timor-
ous of my surviving followers i am
not so hard a master try me ac-
cept my help please yourself in life
as you have done hitherto please
yourself more amply spread your el-
bows at the board and when the

night begins to fall and the curtains
to be drawn i tell you for your
greater comfort that you will find it
even easy to compound your quarrel
with your conscience and to make a
truckling peace with god i came
but now from such a death-bed and
the room was full of sincere mourn-
ers listening to the mans last words
and when i looked into that face
which had been set as a flint against
mercy i found it smiling with hope  
and do you then suppose me
such a creature asked markheim
do you think i have no more gen-
erous aspirations than to sin and sin
and sin and at last sneak into heav-
en my heart rises at the thought
is this then your experience of man-
kind or is it because you find me
with red hands that you presume
such baseness and is this crime of
murder indeed so impious as to dry
up the very springs of good   

  murder is to me no special cate-
gory ieplied the other all sins
are murder even as all life is war
i behold your race like starving
mariners on a raft plucking crusts
out of the hands of famine and feed-
ing on each others lives i follow
sins beyond the moment of their act-
ing i find in all that the last conse-
quence is death and to my eyes the
pretty maid who thwarts her mother
with such taking graces on a question
of a ball drips no less visibly with
human gore than such a murderer as
yourself do i say that i follow
sins  i follow virtues also they dif-
fer not by the thickness of a nail
they are both scythes for the reaping
angel of death evil for which i
live consists not in action but in
character the bad man is dear to
me not the bad act whose fruits if
we could follow them far enough
down the hurtling cataract of the
ages might yet be found more blessed
than those of the rarest virtues and
it is not because you have killed a
dealer but because you are mark-
markheim



heim that i offer to forward your
escape

  i will lay my heart open to you
answered markheim   this crime
on which you find me is my last on
my way to it i have learned many
lessons itself is a lesson a momen-
tous lesson hitherto i have been driv-
en with revolt to what i would not
i was a bondslave to poverty driven
and scourged there are robust vir-
tues that can stand in these tempta-
tions  mine was not so i had a
thirst of pleasure but today and
out of this deed i pluck both warn-
ing and riches-both the power and
a fresh resolve to be myself i be-
come in all things a free actor in the
world i begin to see myself all
ehanged these hands the agents of
good this heart at peace something
comes over me out of the past some-
thing of what i have dreamed on
sabbath evenings to the sound of the
ehureh organ of what i forecast
when i shed tears over noble books
or talked an innocent child with my
mother there lies my life i have
wandered a few years but now i see
once more my city of destination  

  you are to use this money on the
stock exchange i think remarked
the visitor and there if i mistake
not you have already lost some thou-
sands

  ah said markheim but this
time i have a sure thing

  this time again you will lose
replied the visitor quietly

  ah but i keep back the half
cried markheim

  that also you will lose said the
other

  the sweat started upon mark-
heims brow well then what mat-
ter he exclaimed say it be
lost say i am plunged again in pov-
erty shall one part of me and that
the worse continue until the end to
override the better evil and good
run strong in me haling me both

ways i do not love the one thing i
love all i can conceive great deeds
renunciations martyrdoms and
though i be fallen to such a crime as
murder pity is no stranger to my
thoughts i pity the poor who
knows their trials better than my-
self i pity and help them i prize
love i love honest laughter there is
no good tiling nor true thing on
earth but i love it from my heart
and are my vices only to direct my
life and my virtues to lie without ef-
fect like some passive lumber of the
mind not so good also is a spring
of acts

  but the visitant raised his finger
for six-and-tliirty years that you
have been in this world said he
through many changes of fortune
and varieties of humor i have
watched you steadily fall fifteen
years ago you would have started at
a theft three years back you would
have blenched at the name of murder
is there any crime is there any
cruelty or meanness from which you
still recoil-five years from now i
shall detect you in the fact down-
ward downward lies your way nor
ean anything but death avail to stop
you

  it is true markheim said husk-
ily i have in some degree complied
with evil but it is so with all the
very saints in the mere exercise of
living grow less dainty and take on
the tone of their surroundings

  i will propound to you one simple
question said the other and as
you answer i shall read to you your
moral horoscope you have grown
in many things more lax possibly
you do right to be so and at any ac-
count it is the same with all men
but granting that are you in any one
particular however trifling more
difficult to please with your own con-
duct or do you go in all things with
a looser rein

 in any one repeated mark-
heim with an anguish of considera-


weird tales

tion no he added with despair

  in none i have gone down in all  
then said the visitor content
yourself with what you are for you
will never change and the words of
your part on this stage are irrev-
ocably written down

  markheim stood for a long while
silent and indeed it was the visitor
who first broke the silence that
being so he said shall i show you
the money

  and grace cried markheim
have you not tried it returned
the other two or three years ago
did i not see you on the platform of
revival meetings and was not your
voice the loudest in the hymn

  it is true said markheim and
i see clearly what remains for me by
way of duty i thank you for these
lessons from my soul my eyes are
opened and i behold myself at last
for what i am

at this moment the sharp note of
the door-bell rang through the
house and the visitant as though
this were some concerted signal for
which he had been waiting changed
at once in his demeanor

  the maid he cried she has
returned as i forewarned you and
there is now before you one more
difficult passage her master you
must say is ill you must let her in
with an assured but rather serious
countenance-no smiles no overact-
ing and i promise you success once
the girl within and the door closed
the same dexterity that has already
rid you of the dealer will relieve you
of this last danger in your path
thenceforward you have the whole
evening-the whole night if needful
-to ransack the treasures of the
house and to make good your safety
this is help that comes to you with

the mask of danger up  he cried
up friend your life hangs trem-
bling in the scales up and act

  markheim steadily regarded his
counselor if i be condemned to
evil acts he said there is still one
door of freedom open-i can cease
from action if my life be an ill
thing i can lay it down though i
be as you say truly at the beck of
every small temptation i can yet by
one decisive gesture place myself be-
yond the reach of all my love of
good is damned to barrenness it
may and let it be but i have still
my hatred of evil and from that to
your galling disappointment you
shall see that i can draw both energy
and courage

  the features of the visitor began
to undergo a wonderful and lovely
change they brightened and soft-
ened with a tender triumph and
even as they brightened faded and
dislimned but markheim did not
pause to watch or understand the
transformation he opened the door
and went downstairs very slowly
thinking to himself his past went
soberly before him he beheld it as
it was ugly and strenuous like a
dream random as chance-medley-a
scene of defeat life as he thus re-
viewed it tempted him no longer
but on the farther side he perceived
a quiet haven for his bark he
paused in the passage and looked in-
to the shop where the candle still
burned by the dead body it was
strangely silent thoughts of the
dealer swarmed into his mind as he
stood gazing and then the bell once
more broke out into impatient
clamor

  he confronted the maid upon the
threshold with something like a smile

  you had better go for the
police said he i have killed your
master
etters arc still pouring in to the eyrie on the question of whether
weird tales should continue to use one weird story reprint in
 each issue and so far those who want us to continue our reprint policy
are greatly in the majority so in obedience to your wishes we shall con-
tinue our policy of selecting each month one of the short-story masterpieces
of weird fiction from the literature of the past but all the other stories in
each issue will be entirely new the best current weird fiction and weird-
scientific fiction that can be obtained in the future as in the past
weird tales will print a type of fiction such as can be obtained nowhere
else-highly imaginative tales of science and pseudo-science such as explor-
ers into infinity in this issue  tales of supernatural horror such as out of
the earth in this issue  tales of spirit return such as the return in this
issue  bizarre and fantastic tales occult and mystic stories tales of terror
and mystery tales of werewolves witcheiait and devil-worship and tales
of strange monsters it is on such stories that the brilliant success of
weird tales has been built and we shall continue to give you the readers
a wide variety of the best weird fiction in the world

    arthur w davenport of buffalo new york asks for more orientales
according to my opinion you have published very few oriental weird
stories he writes to the minds of most people the east is filled with
mystery and weird happenings in saying that the plot of a story is laid
in new york or london there is no special effect produced upon the mind
of the auditor yet how different is the connotation of the words bagdad
stamboul and damascus mystery intrigue and weirdness are disclosed in
the open sesame of those words the unusual fairly leaps into being
the unknown and the unusual should produce the most weird effect in story-
telling

    weird tales will publish a number of weird oriental tales such as mr
davenport asks for during this year some of the best orientales of recent
magazine literature have appeared in the pages of this magazine for in-
stance the asiatic talcs of e hoffmann price and the chinese fantasies of
frank owen and letters are still coming in from readers praising murray
leinsters powerful asiatic torture-tale the oldest story in the world
which appeared in weird tales

    i have been a silent admirer of weird tales long enough writes
jack t chord of new york city so i want to take this opportunity of
telling you how i enjoy the first of every month when w t appears on the

                                                                           g


weird tales

stands i seldom have time to read but when i do i want the stories to take
me far away from earthly environments thats just what weird tales
does for me and many others

    writes marion clemen tz of st petersburg florida dear eyrie-
dem good issue this february one hope the rest are like it cause heres
one guy whos gonna read weird tales my choice of this here february
issue is the man who cast no shadow the atomic conquerors and the
unearthly drome shore held me tense till i came to the end of part two
and the star shell also was good while it lasted excuse my slang

    harold d scherer of winona minnesota writes to the eyrie a
year ago last august i happened to notice a copy of weird tales in a maga-
zine shop and since that time i have not missed a single copy neither have
i missed reading a single story in your wonderful magazine interplanetary
stories excite my imagination more than any other kind and i also am very
fond of stories of reincarnation

    drome grows more wonderful with each succeeding chapter writes
margaret harper of claymont delaware it seems plausible enough that
a strange land could exist under a great range of mountains the sign of
the seven skulls was certainly weird enough to suit any lover of weird tales
and the brimstone cat was certainly out of the ordinary and very enter-
taining  

    seabury quinns stories writes karl houghton of lakewood ohio
are without a doubt above all others and i wish to say that he has the im-
mortal poe shoved off the map the atomic conquerors is fine i only wish
we could have more of those tales of dire things that move the whole world
to terror like the metal giants and the abysmal horror but the church
stove at raebrudafisk is the one i enjoyed most in the february issue it is
stories where minor happenings lead up to fearful results that get my vote
for the best stories

    a w oswald of syracuse new york writes to the eyrie i think
that drome now in its second installment is one of the best serial stories
yet published being different from the usual type which have had to do
entirely with scientific subjects and materialistic creatures i hope it doesnt
end by having the creatures found under the mountain remnants of a lost
race but still humans although i suppose in the end the so-called angel
will fall in love with the scientist as is usually the case the sign of the
seven skidls was really the best weird story in your last issue lets have
more stories of the hartz mountains and the black forest

    mrs e m burton of birmingham alabama chooses three stories as
her favorites in the february issue for the following reasons the man
who cast no shadow because it is well written is clear enough for anyone
to understand and i like that type of story anyway the atomic conquer-
ors because i have never read another story of that exact type and because
although it is utterly impossible it is so well written that you almost be-
lieve that it is possible the sign of the seven skidls because it makes the
gooseflesh go up and down ones spine and still you read on believe me
that does not happen always for a good many so-called horror stories leave
a  bad taste in the mouth   

    by all means continue to publish reprints urges george i foster
rector of the church of the good shepherd in cleveland ohio for such
writers as wilkie collins edgar allan poe and washington irving are al-
the eyrie



ways a treat to intelligent readers among your own writers that i most ad-
mire are lovecraft and quinn tied for first place with burks hamilton
and morgan a close second i bought my first copy of weird tales about
four years ago while waiting for a suburban ear as i was going to deliver
a lecture in a neighboring town and i have never missed a number since
for many of your contributions surpass poe at his best

    paul kerlsson johnstone of st louis writes to the eyrie why not
have more stories like the lost race in your january issue dealing with
the people of britain before the norman conquest certainly many things
must have happened while piet scot roman briton saxon jute angle
and dane struggled for mastery that would make fiction look tame i have
an idea that many of the tales of that time about  b c to  a d
which are dismissed as mere myths are cold truth certainly archeology has
found these old legends to be startlingly accurate in many ways

    writes sherlock r hope of jacksonville florida edmond hamilton
in his own realm of writing is head and shoulders above all others i con-
sider his the metal giants a masterpiece of his type of fiction i look for-
ward to future issues of weird tales which i sincerely hope will bring
more such stories from this authors pen

    we offered to give the original typescript of seabury quinns cover-de
sign story in the february issue autographed by the author for the most
helpful and constructive letter sent to the eyrie discussing the stories in
that issue the typescript was won by fred w fischer jr of knoxville ten-
nessee

    readers your favorite story in the february issue as shown by your
votes was the atomic conquerors by edmond hamilton and your second
choice was the man who cast no shadow by seabury quinn what is your
favorite story in the present issue

house beside it i could see the house
shifting on its foundations a corner
of it tilted downward

place the switch moved farther
clicked with a tremendous snap that
reverberated about us the growth
of the monster was checked it stood
there serene triumphant with the
little house tilted but still standing
bravely beside it

  white shaken we ceased our ef-

only wanted to make it a normal size

  we had gotten the vehicle back to

all day had been working to equip
it the instrument room-its space
and time and size mechanisms were
complete i had learned now that
it was to be transported through
space by very similar principles to
those commonly in use-a controlled
attraction or repulsion of the faces
of its cube for the heavenly body
nearest to it in effect an intensifica-
tion-a neutralization-or reversal
at will of the electronic force which
flows between and mutually attracts
all material bodies the force which
once-in centuries past-was called
gravitation it needed no word of
explanation its velocity and dis-
tance dials its direction indicators
were familiar though rather more in-
tricate than those i had seen in the
interplanetary service beyond that
there was a bank of dials upon which
a changing size was recorded-with
the vehicles present starting dimen-
sions to be the standard unit and
other dials for its time-change of
these there were two distinct sets
one a record of the normal time-
change inevitable to a change of
size another a comparison of that
time-distance with the normal time-

 apparatus the myrdoscope and a
 receiver for an aural ray which as a
 guide to brett dr gryce was to send
 from earth of this in more detail
 they later explained

   in a smaller room were the appa-
 ratus for air renewal the making of
 various necessary gases water and
 synthetic foods a store-room of pro-
 visions rooms furnished comfortably
 so that the vehicle was complete in its
 living quarters a thousand details
 until at the last i felt as frannie did
 -wondering how we could have
 failed to overlook a score of things
 we had intended to do

   it was nightfall when we finished
 and all that evening we spent check-
 ing up the equipment dr gryces
 home had not been seriously dam-
 aged by the mornings mishap and
 as midnight approached we gathered
 in the little observation and instru-
 ment room he had built in its upper
 story brett and martt it had been
 decided were to make the journey
 we others were to watch and wait it
 seemed the more difficult role all
 that evening dr gryce had been in-
 creasingly silent careworn of man-
 ner and aspect and though brett
 was excited in his maturerepressed
 fashion-and martt frankly exuber-
 ant-i saw that little frannie was
 solemn perturbed as her father

   it was a soft brilliant cloudless
 night with no moon to pale the
 gleaming stars and at last every
 detail was settled and the midnight
 hour we had set for departure was
 at hand we went forth with them
 to the waiting vehicle there was
 nothing more to say they stood-
 brett and martt-in the opened door-
 way as we gathered about them

   well - good-bye father - good-
 bye frannie dear brett held her
 close then released her pushed her
 away good-bye frank his
 hand-clasp was warm and steady
weird tales



  martt was jocular but now at the
last i could hear a tremble to his
voice when we get to that girl out
there-well im going to tell her
how interested you all are in her
his laugh was high-pitched that
is if we can handle that giant

  good-bye brett good-bye
martt

  our words were so futile so inade-
quate to the surge of feeling within
us the door slid closed upon them
the vehicle not to change size until it
was far into the realms of outer
interstellar space beyond our crowd-
ing little planets-lifted gently
soared upward slid away from us a
glistening white shape up there in
the quiet starlight

  gravely silently with what sink-
ing of heart i could only imagine
dr gryce stood regarding it be-
side me frannie was crying softly

  explorers into infinity and they
were gone to encounter-what

   the marvels of the voyage through space and
time and the search for the girl in that vaster
world to rescue her from her danger will be de-
scribed next month

   author of the metal giants and
   the atomic conquerors-a tale

   years in the future that reaches

the ruler of
destiny

continued from page 

 toward him from the pink wall ten-
 tacles of death reached out toward
 him he knew full well now what
 his end must be one moment he
 looked out from the top of his labora-
 tory upon the ruin he had wrought
 saw that his world had come to chaos
 and all the unutterable terror of a
 world ages old rose up within his
 soul beating upon his reason like a
 blight of infinity ponderously he
 rushed down the stairs out the door
 and into the desolate street before his
 workhouse the stench of the dead
 was in his nostrils purple fingers of
 horror reached out toward him pur-
 ple that changed to black the wrath
 of god was descending upon him in
 that black cloud hovering above inky
 ever increasing in magnitude crush-
 ing down upon his tortured soul sur-
 rounding him in impalpable gloom
 like a cloak of blackness

   a tongue of purple licked through
 the air hovered above him his huge
 face was gray with terror his eyes
 filled with panic he tried to run
 fell rose to his feet staggered to-
 ward the pink veil which held out the
 purple trying to hold it back breath
 coming in hoarse sobs eyes aflame
 then blinded with tears cheeks jounc-
 ing he tore at the pink as though it
 were a tangible thin g-passed
 through

   the fingers of the purple night
 swept in upon him gladly one might
 think though there was none left to
 see tentacles of purple swathed him
 clasped him crushed him

   a moment of unutterable terror
 an instant of fiery pain a burst of
 vivid memory as the gates to hell
 yawned then the master of destiny
 was no more

before you ask questions let me
show you a passage from a recent

  he went over to one of the shelves

showing you this passage let me ex-
plain just one point the adrenal
or supraienal gland lies just above
the kidney and anatomically has two
parts an outer cortex or shell and
an inner medulla or pulp the
medulla gives off adrenalin which
regulates blood pressure in all parts
of the body through action on the
blood vessels the cortex gives off an
unknown secretion which seems to
have a remarkable influence when

happen now read what i have indi-
cated

  he placed the volume before me
and this is what i read

  the main course of cortical disease
proceeds as follows

  a in eaxly eases there is precocious
sexuality adiposity in the pelvic region re-
markable muscular strength recalling the
enfwnts hercules of the french writers in
girls there is a marked tendency toward
maleness later on the fatty tissue is lost
the children grow thin and die of exhaus-
tion

  b in young women the disease devel-
ops with phenomenal muscular strength
and endurance assertiveness and even pug-
nacity of behavior and excessive sexuality
this stage is followed by the appearance of
male characters such as beardedness gen-
eral hairiness and hair on chest and abdo-
men here we are reminded of the strong
women and bearded ladies of the circuses
and side-shows later the muscular strength
is replaced by excessive weakness and final-
ly death from exhaustion ensues

  thus far i read jove i ex-
claimed then this woman-this
bonita-was-  

  precisely said dr wilkie
she was suffering from cortical dis-
ease the symptoms are clear she
was really helpless driven inexorably
by a malady over which she had no
control like the nuremberg maiden
she crushed those that she em-
braced  

 humph i mused and so
your guinea-pig-

  yes i have experimented with it
causing an excessive or altered secre-
tion by the use of eertain injections
the symptoms are the same-heavy
buttocks phenomenal strength pug-
nacity even the appearance of male
characters the last i figure to be
the turning point this animal
should before very long grow weak
and die from exhaustion looking
back at the experience with bonita
i feel that she had reached her turn-
ing point also and would have died
in typical exhaustion this experi-
ment has helped me understand her
ease the case of bonita
