the land of unborn babies

tv maeterlincks play-

the blue bird you see the exquisite land-all misty blue
-where coundess babies are waiting their time to be bom

as each ones hour comes father time swings wide the big gatt
out flies the stork with a tiny bundle addressed to earth

the baby cries lustily at leaving its nest of soft fleecy clouds-
not knowing what kind of an earthly nest it will be dropped into

every baby cannot be bom into a luxurious home-cannot find
awaiting it a dainty hygienic nursery rivalling in beauty the
misty cloud-land

but it is every childs rightful heritage to be bom into a clean
healthful home where the blue bird of happiness dwells

qas each child is so born-

the community the nation and the home are richer for just
as the safety of a building depends upon its foundation of rock
or concrete so does the safety of the race depend upon its
foundation-the baby

and just as there is no use in repairing a building above if its
foundation be weak there is no use in hoping to build a strong
civilization except through healthy happy babies

thousands of babies-

die needlessly every year thousands of rickety little feet falter
along lifes highway thousands of imperfect baby-eyes strain
to get a clear vision of the wonders that surround them thou-
sands of defective ears cannot hear even a mothers lullaby

and thousands of physically unfit men and women occupy back
seats in life are counted failures-all because of the thousands

the land of unborn babies

and thousands of babies who have been denied the birthright of
a sanitary and protective home

so that wherever one looks-the need for better homes is ap-
parent and wherever one listens can be heard the call for such
homes from the land of unborn babies

the call is being heard-

by the schools and colleges that are establishing classes in home-
making and motherhood by public nurses and other noble
women who are visiting the homes of those who need help and
instruction by the hospitals that are holding baby clinics

by towns and cities that are holding baby weeks and health exhibits by mag-
azines and newspapers that are publishing articles on pre-natal care

by congress that has passed the mothers and babies act under which health boards
in every state will be called upon to give information to expectant mothers

all this is merely a beginning-

the ground has hardly been broken for the nations only safe found-
ation-healthy babies-each of whom must have its rightful heritage
-an even chance-a healthy body
the call will not be answered until every mother every father and
every community helps to make better homes in which to welcome
visitors from the land of unborn babies

an account of how captain billings lost
his luggage

he who sets forth upon the road knows not what
the road will bring nor does he know the hour of his
return-mongol proverb

od go with you my excellent sir

keep to the highroad by all

the verst-posts my good gentle-
man its a matter of some twenty versts
to zaritzan maybe thirty or forty

the stranger who had stopped to eat a
hasty supper at the frontier post on the
highroad from astrakan to zaritzan sprang
into the saddle of his pony and pulled the

adventure

a silver shilling it was one of his last and
he had not hired a sledge because the supper
had nearly emptied his purse

  remember the man called after him
keep due north along the right bank of the
volga on the other bank begins the great
steppe where you would lose your way at the
first turn then the men from over the
river would rip you up like a fish and leave
you in the snow mind my words- his
hoarse voice grew fainter-if you see a
tatar from over the river pistol him at
once

  passing the windmills at the end of the
hamlet captain billings smiled a cheerful
road this he reflected

  it would have been better of course to
have lain the night at the post and gone on
by daylight but captain billings had an
appointment that evening at zaritzan and
he meant to keep it there was a commis-
sion awaiting him at zaritzan and he meant
to have it

  captain billings had been stranded at
astrakan after completing a survey of the
north coast of the caspian for governor
beketoff of that town beketoff had been
most polite but being out of funds and
likewise out of favor with the territorial
ministry at st petersburg billings was not
paid nightly he had played chess with the
governor and sampled every vintage of wine
the castle boasted

  the wine was not good and billings tired
of putting beketoff to bed every evening
under the table so he had borrowed a good
pony from the governor and-since he
could not pay for a sledge-had entrusted
his luggage to a detail of cossacks under
a sotnik bound up the ice-coated volga

  now this luggage of captain billings was
very valuable to himself at least it was
the first time he had parted with it even
for a few days it was a peculiar thing that
luggage but the cossacks traveled more
slowly than he and billings had sent word
ahead by courier that he would be at zarit-
zan before midnight he had a habit of
keeping his promises

  from time to time as he rode he tried to
catch a glimpse of the gray sheet of the
volga somewhere to his right but the
forest had set in again arid the spruces made
a corridor of the road that was merely a
narrow track in the snow

  already the sun was behind the pines and
a cold wind stirred up the fine snow into

a dust that stung his face he pulled down
his sheepskin cap and fell to beating his
arms across his chest and he did not
notice that the verst posts were no longer to
be seen in fact the trail he followed had
narrowed down to the track of a single
horse

  my faith its cold as - when the

devils gone to mass captain billings
assured himself and not so much as a
tavern to break the hedgerows

  his gray-greenish eyes spaced wide sur-
veyed the shadows of the forest slowly
his high cheek bones were reddened by long
exposure to the sun of the caspian billings
was of middle age with a back like a pike-
staff and a swagger to his shoulders that
concealed his lack of height

  since boyhood-and a thankless one-
he had grown up with weapons lived by his
wits he wore no wig and his yellow hair
had been bleached by the sun to the color
of tow school had been for him the ap-
prenticeship at the table of a master navi-
gator and the salle d armes of a french
swordsman now unhappily dead during the
vicissitudes of that changeful lady paris
he had not always found bread in plenty
but there had been no lack of fighting

  a pox on these misbegotten muscovite
charts

  he had noticed the absence of the verst
posts these however had been covered
for the most part by drifting snow the
moon had risen on his right and by its light
he scanned the lines of the map of the fron-
tier according to it he should have been at
zaritzan by now

  instead he was off the highroad he
could go back to the last post or turn out
into the river and wait for the sledge which
should be along that night but neither
choice was to his liking he tore up the
worthless chart and plied his ponys flanks
with the black cossack whip he carried re-
solved to follow the track of the horse in
front of him so long as it led to the north

  as if in answer to his decision the howl
of a wolf came up the wind billings stead-
ied the pony and settled himself in the sad-
dle he no longer needed the whip his
eyes narrowed against the cut of the wind
his glance thrusting into the shadows on
either hand to pick out the yellow gleam of
eyes

  drawing off a glove his numbed fingers
felt of the priming of the long pistols in the
the road of the giants



saddle holsters the snow had dampened the
powder

  now the trees were thinning curling
wraiths of snow danced in the shifting moon-
light as the wind came with a sweep across
the dunes of the open a moment later he
drew in his horse beside the trail a figure
appeared standing over a dead pony

   zounds cried billings under his breath
 heres a merry go

   the other in a long kaftan and a tall
sheepskin hat too large for him seemed to be
no more than a boy a swarthy boy with
eyes like black jewels he held a simitar
that dripped blood upon the white surface
of the snow billings observed that the
throat of the horse had been cut

  promptly the lad who might have been
gipsy or tatar sheathed his weapon and
stood straight and quiet

   koshkildui peace be with you brother
 said captain billings in russian get up
 behind me young man

   the stripling took his time about answer-
 ing	

  you are a giaour-an outlander he
observed slowly in the southern dialect
you are no man of russia-i knew that by
your first speech

   indeed billings pulled at his yellow
mustache do you wish to follow your
horse into the bellies of the wolves who are
back yonder

  tchu-i fear no wolves uncle you
ride from astrakan and you have been at
the palace of the excellency beketoff

  the- thought billings reining in

his uneasy horse this fellow is uncom-
monly particular about whom he joins com-
pany with

   the rapscallion however had a certain
bravado about him might be a gipsy for
all of his smooth olive skin and large eyes
and he had certainly kept his sword ready
to hand until spoken to

   uncle went on the youth impassively
if you were a russian boyar a noble you
wouldnt offer to take up a poor gipsy be-
hind you-now would you not when the
wolves were afoot

   nephew i am captain minard billings
cartographer and i am minded to leave you
afoot

  cartographer-what is that

  a maker of maps

   in the moonlight a smile flashed over the
 face of the native there was an elusive

 charm about the boy certainly for all his
 respect he did not speak in the manner of
 a serf or a suppliant son of egypt

  billings grunted

  if you are satisfied step out

  with that he put spurs to the pony the
native promptly shed his heavy coat and ran
beside on the hard surface of the crust
clinging to a stirrup

  how far is it to zaritzan asked billings
  two leagues good uncle

  the black pest on those russians

  at this the youth glanced up startled
billings had been thinking of the discarded
chart

  is this the highroad young man
nay the road joined the river bank well
back in the forest but this track will lead
you there

  before long they heard a chorus of yelp-
ing howls in the distance the wolf pack
had reached the horse the boy glanced up

  my pony fell and came up lame the
wolves were near so i cut its throat here
we are in the forest again and we must go
swiftly

  with that he was up behind billings his
breath warm on the travelers neck to
keep his balance the boy clung to the
others belt reaching around to the clasp
once the belt slipped and the native tight-
ened it he had drawn his simitar and
held it awkwardly in front of billings
pardon he cried

  the blade slipping down had cut the
captain slightly across the upper leg as if
ashamed of the mishap he leaped down
again running beside the pony

  although nothing more was heard of the
wolves they set a good pace until they
passed an empty sentry box and around a
turn in the road sighted the black bulk of
a wall behind which rose the thatched roofs
of houses and a watch-tower

  zaritzan panted the boy pointing to
a light that showed by the stanitza gate

  good billings dismounted a bowl
of hot porridge now and some steaming
brandy

  i can not enter zaritzan

  why not where would you go

  the boy pointed to where the light-a
lanthorn in the hand of a soldier the same
who had prudently deserted the sentry box
-was moving toward them slowly

  the wolves i fear are within the gate
uncle


adventure

  hum billings wondered what manner
of man this was who preferred the black
depths of the volga forest to a town
hulloa-what are you about

  the native had been whispering under his
breath his expressive eyes were serious
now he seized the officers fingers and lifted
their hands in the air toward the south and
the other quarters of the compass on the
back of his wrist was a cut over which the
blood had dried

  on billings fingers was the stain of blood
from the slight wound over his knee

  my lord whispered the boy you have
looked in the face of danger for my sake
this night you have saved my life although
you know not how now i have made us
atulas brothers as you first named me
and what foolery is that billings
pulled his hand away impatiently

  when men become andas my brother
both have one life neither abandons the
other and each guards the life of his anda
tonight i have bound the girdles and let flow
the blood of both and made strong our anda
a tatar billings remembered the boy
had said he came from over the river
a native gipsy or baskir or tatar would
not go through this mummery of brother-
hood without expecting some reward

  a second time the tatar smiled

  give me your horse for this night and
you will not lose it his eyes flickered from
the advancing sentry to billings face

  indeed i will not the wolves would
make marrow paste of the mare

  not they my lord the mare will be
under your hand within two days come
you have given me something already
captain beel-ing are we not andas

  the boy stiffened leaped boldly into the
saddle and was off pelting through the
dead bushes

  pardon my lord-brother he called
back laughing over his shoulder

  billings snatched at his belt and shrugged
both his pistols were in the saddle holsters
his temper flared as he watched the mare
and rider go flitting along the edge of the
hemlocks down toward the shining lane that
was the moons reflection on the river

  it was rather curious the ease with which
the tatar guided the tired horse away from
shelter riding as if he were one with the
mare there was no help for it horse and
weapons were gone and billings felt the
loss of both keenly

  a witch suggested the soldier who had
drawn close and was watching

  billings reflected that the sentry at the
last post had told him to shoot down any
tatar at sight

  oh he bewitched me jarely he mut-
tered disliking the idea of arriving in zar-
itzan on foot like a peasant

  of course nodded the soldier holding
the lanthorn close to his visitor i saw it
done he did it with your hand sir like
a regular tatar werewolf snatching where
the blood runs

  the bearded sergeant was busy making
the sign of the cross with his free hand it
was perplexing after all that the native had
shown so little dread of the wolves

  the lord be merciful to us the sentry
was staring at the cut in billings breeches
see theres where he sipped your blood
they usually take the back of the neck just
behind the ear

  when billings looked up the man was
running toward the gate stumbling over his
musket in his haste dropping the firearm
he fumbled with the door to shut it this
was a trifle too much for billings to stomach

  he sprang into the opening wedged his
boot against the door and flung it back on
the soldier

  hide of beelzebub-so you would leave
a christian to the cold and the beasts eh
a sergeant too on my word

  muttering that he had orders to admit
no strangers the man changed countenance
when billings thrust his musket into his
hand wheeled him about and requested
that he announce to the pristof kichinskoi
that captain billings was here from
astrakan

  at once-at once your excellency i
assure you captain the witch robbed me of
my senses enter your honor the great
commissioner is expecting you and gave
word you were to go direct to his quarters
but when billings was not looking the
soldier backed away making the sign to
ward off devils with fingers crossed

  billings paid no attention to him he
had just discovered that the purse attached
to his belt for safekeeping had disappeared

the moon by now was well over-
head and the whole of zaritzan was
outlined by the etching of shadow
it was one of the forts just completed by
order of the czarina catherine the second of
the road of the giants



russia these forts formed a chain along
the western border of the great tatar steppe

  an earthen rampart surmounted by a
palisade was pierced for several cannon
all facing toward the river the center of
the place was a square of beaten clay a drill
ground in the corner of which near the gate
stood wooden stocks a knout hanging there-
on by a ruty nail

  on one side of the enclosure ran a line of
barracks and stables clustered against
these as if for protection were the huts of
traders wine sellers and smiths behind
these sheds a glow dimmed the moonlight
and loud voices broke the silence of the
night groups of coated figures moved be-
tween the huts swaggering out on the
square

  whenever the soldiers came near the gate
side of the drill ground they hushed and
walked more quickly here stood a rude
church of logs with a painting on the
planks of the door and a weather-stained
cross of silver gilt at the peak

  beside the church and abreast the stocks
was the two-storied bulk of the governors
house its mica windows tinted with orange
light the watch-tower built up from its roof
a deep voice within roared out a song of
the steppe

          sken shen shivagen

         seize your horse and spur again

         ride ride speed and turn-

         burn burn

  as zaritzan was on the river route of the
volga and was the point on the steppe
nearest the highway to moscow in this
building the prisiof kichinskoi had his
quarters - kichinskoi nominally great
commissioner of the tatars actually sur-
veillant of the frontier for the empress an
informant who had authority even over the
military commanders and whose word was
law on the volga

  kichinskoi was in his office when billings
entered-a heavy man with a smooth pale
face and small features he lay back on a
sofa one foot in a polished boot on the
table in front of him he paid no attention
to the captain after one swift glance but
went on talking to a timid-looking priest
who sat on a stool close to the charcoal
brazier

  old wives tales i tell you my dear
batko there will be no rising among the
torgut tatars i have talked with the

torgut khan and told him a thing or two to
put in his ear with the fleas pah didnt
you see father obe that the khan was
afraid to answer me

  yes excellency the khan did not an-
swer

  of course not

  thrusting both hands deep into the pock-
ets of a sable-lined overcoat the pristof
yawned and began to pick at his teeth

  the tatars are dogs a little lashing
you know goes a long way with them
didnt they come to the steppe of their own
accord several generations ago to beg for
lands when they were driven out of china
or some such thing we need them of
course the ministry wants horses and
taxes and the torguts can give us both
and their khan raised a levy of forty thou-
sand cavalry in the war with the sultan-
killed a lot of infidels for the glory of god
and we got azov isnt that true priest
true muttered the small priest with
more assurance this time-

  kichinskoi took snuff from a gilt box
without offering it to billings he closed the
box and dusted off his chest with a si-
kerchief

  dogs or rather wolves hg resumed
but we would fight them tftfrfier than lose
them i know what is whispered behind the
doors of the ministry every house has its
watchdog father obe you feed them
bones-ha yes our watchdogs are the
cos---

  he glanced toward the door whence came
the noise of carousal and the mellow voice
of the singer while he seemed to pay no
attention to billings he was covertly scan-
ning the visitor

  i was going to say tatars under my
advice they fight the baskirs turks and
other accursed savages dog eat dog you
take my point i ha my hand on the
leash and they wont dare to rebel what-
ever fools like governor beketoff may say-
ha captain billings what does your friend
the governor say now about those pagans
over the river

  he turned swiftly on his visitor billings
had savored how he was being received in the
first moment instead of standing or try-
ing to interrupt the self-satisfied official he
had seated himself on the stool opposite the
priest had thrown open his coat and taken
out his pipe after filling this he took his
time about answering stooping instead to


adventure

draw a coal from the brazier to light his pipe

  beketoff he responded calmly does
not wag his tongue for the sake of hearing
it go 

  kichinskoi brought his boot down from
the table with a thump and frowned

  confound it captain you make your-
self fiendishly at home i must say youre
sitting down i must call your attention to
that and am i smoking pray

  no you took snuff

   the priest cringed back into the shadows
and raised his hands kichinskoi stared
banefully into the emotionless leather-like
face of the adventurer billings greenish
eyes were frank and not at all cordial
kichinskoi noted with some interest the
smartly cut coat and the embroidered waist-
coat of the captain

  kichinskoi was a clever man but-as is
often the case-thought himself cleverer
than he was already in the third rank of
the nobility he liked to be addressed as of
the second his weakness was vanity he
looked meaningly at father obe

  do you know sir the priest hastened
-to say that captain billings you are
addressing the pristof himself his excel-
lency is gpmmissioner over the torguts
who are thera tarsalon the volga gov-
ernor beketoff has seen fit to send couriers
to st petersburg-to high officials-charg-
ing that the torguts are about to take up
the sword against christians he asked
you whether beketoff still persists in that
delusion

   his excellency he added in a whisper
has denied to the empress herself the
viceroy of the church that the tatars
would rebel

   then tell his excellency father obe
said billings quickly if he has brought me
from astrakan merely to repeat the confi-
dences of governof beketoff i shall make
haste to return tomorrow morning

  father obe looked at kichinskoi who
blinked like a disturbed owl but having
studied the map-maker he changed his
tactics

  by the ashes of sodom my dear cap-
tain you speak our russian language well
foidemafai and my inform- i hear from
astrakan that you have completed a splen-
did chart of the caspian shore for my friend
governor beketoff who did not pay you
a copeck also you speak tatar somewhat
i take it you are versed in-ah astronomic

science and are-yes a master hand at
making a map

  billings bowed without answering

  now unfortunately captain billings
our russian cartographers have given us
poor charts of the volga and the great plain
to the east vraiment mon ami what do
you think of those charts of the steppe
hum billings smiled grimly
exactly i am commissioned by the
empress herself to prepare a map to present
with my report	

  a map-of what billings asked

  ah you perceive the point a map my
dear sir of the great tatar steppe kich-
inskoi drew a paper from the pile on his
desk and read lrom it

   it is desired an officer be commissioned to set
out from the river volga for the river yaik and
from there to the torgai from this point he will
journey to the lake that is called tengis or balkash
and he will complete a true and fine map of this
territory

   he is furthermore instructed to settle by astro-
nomic observation the exact position of the lake of
balkash concerning which divers opinions are held
in all instances this officer is to conciliate the natives
and confirm them in their favorable opinion of the
russian government to which they have recently
submitted by order of the imperial society of
st petersburg

  practically the whole of the tatar
steppe assented billings fifteen hun-
dred miles-five thousand versts first
plains down below sea level then a desert-
a blank place in your charts ornamented by
a picture of a tribesman sitting in front of
his tent and then-

  he hesitated an old armenian mer-
chant at the astrakan waterfront had sold
him a map of the east the traders of the
caravan routes had a good knowledge of the
terrane and the armenian had tales to tell

  and then prompted kichinskoi sur-
prized at his visitors knowledge
the road of the giants



  mountains pristof shown on your maps
by a pretty sketch of a lion emerging from
a cave but instead of lions-so i have
heard-a race of men that are like animals
they bring women to sell as slaves in the
bazaars of tashkent and bokhara to the
south

  kichinskoi frowned angrily

  tales-tales my agents have provided
against a revolt come now my dear sir
you would be the-ah avant-coureur upon
the steppe that is still a blank space to us
your name will be known by this map
will you undertake it

  he had spoken shrewdly

  your terms demanded billings

  ah-four rubles a day while you are on
your journey two hundred rubles when
the map is approved by me

  four rubles-to hire horses and cara-
vaneers supplies billings flushed

  my dear captain you have your own
horse and your outfit-planisphere com-
pass and spirit level-is coming up the volga
under a cossack sotnik besides what will
you do if you do not accept my offer
indeed there would be nothing for billings
to do but return as best he could to astrakan
and walk the jetties kichinskoi had heard
that the adventurer was penniless and so the
pristof offered less than he had been instruct-
ed to pay for the making of the map it is
the way of the worlds officials to drive a
hard bargain with him whose purse is
empty billings had reason to know this

  some years before he had commanded a
russian sloop that made the voyage from
st petersburg north along the white sea
and thence along the edge of what was then
called the frozen ocean to the mouths
of the yenesei to establish a trading-route
for furs with the mongol-tatar tribes of the
arctic circle

  the russians bought at very low prices
a huge amount of furs annually from the
tatar tribes-sea otters sables ermin
black and red foxes billings knew that
a large portion of the great fur trade passed
through zaritzan-the torguts fetching the
skins from the interior-and a goodly inter-
est of the profits must stick to the fingers of
kichinskoi

  i should return to astrakan as soon as
my luggage arrives he responded thought-
fully and i should write to the ministry
suggesting-as i have already done you
know-that the fur trade could be handled

more cheaply through orenburg or astrakan
than through zaritzan more cheaply that
is where the officials are honest

  again father obe looked troubled but
kichinskoi managed to smile agreeably

  on my oath my dear fellow i had for-
gotten your former services but by the
ashes of sodom the empress must have her
map what are your terms

  six rubles a day for the expenses of a
small caravan five hundred rubles paid
to me in advance as much more when the
map is delivered to you at zaritzan also
your written promise that you will approve
the chart i want no retraction when the
work is in your hands it will be good on
the word of minard billings

  kichinskoi inspected the well-kept fingers
of a plump hand his smile hid a sudden
hatred for the adventurer no one had
dared to outface the pristof in that manner
since he had come to zaritzan billings
in reality had no intention of writing to
the ministry but his shot had gone home

  oh agreed by all means purred
kichinskoi -my soul should gentle-
men quarrel over pennies i will make up
the sum out of my own pocket

  even as he spoke he was planning to force
harsher terms on the map-maker inas-
much as it was learned afterward that
kichinskoi had been furnished with suffi-
cient funds to outfit billings and pay him
two thousand rubles to boot it was literally
true that what he surrendered to the map-
maker came out of his own pocket

  just then a house serf entered and in-
formed the commissioner that his matushna
-his lady-wished to see him with a bow
he excused himself and left billings alone
with the priest

  that devil remarked the maker of
maps no not kichinskoi but the one we
were talking about across the river-you
have seen him father obe

  the priest glanced involuntarily toward
the door that had just closed he had seen
monks who refused to sanction the acts of
russian officials tortured in the prisons of
moscow even the metropolitan of mos-
cow had been whipped by order of cather-
ine herself a profligate woman so he did
not want to say anything that would in-
terfere with the plans of the pristof

  no he responded all at once a kind
of flame came into his weak eyes but i
have heard the talk of the heathen across
io

adventure

the river it is their high-priest who is the
arch fiend he has the face of an animal
and is as tall as a tree our soldiers say he
calls them from the steppe the pristof
captain billings would save the souls of
the heathen we are sending the sons of
the tatars to our kaleka our colleges to
instruct them in christian knowledge
do the sons stay in the kaleka

  you have the gift of foreknowledge
nay even today we heard that alashan the
young son of the torgut khan had escaped
from astrakan a detachment of cossacks
pursued him in vain as far as zaritzan
billings rose having found out from the
priest two things he wanted to know the
tatars would be hostile to any one attempt-
ing to chart their steppe on behalf of the
russian government and the youth he
had rescued on the post road was in all
probability alashan

  all at once he noticed that father obe
was gasping and pointing at him following
the direction of the trembling finger billings
looked down in place of his plain leather
belt he found that he was wearing beneath
the overcoat a girdle of soft red leather
where the coat was parted he could see the
clasp a head of a wolf shaped in black iron

  the sign of the fiend from over the
river cried father obe

in the dining-hall to which the

pristof ushered the map-maker
upon his return the sight of billings
belt produced instant silence dancers
cossacks and women who had been flinging
themselves about until the sweat flew from
their faces and their hair came down-these
stopped to stare and cross themselves

  elegantly dressed under-officials attached
to kichinskois staff drew closer to inspect
the emblem on the clasp uncouth-looking
cossack captains drew back with scowls

  captain billings was sensitive and was
acutely conscious of the belt he could not
discard it-he had no other means of holding
up his breeches

  whispers came to his ears

  the stranger has held commerce with
those across the river

 he had been tempted by the arch-
fiend

  no a witch ran off with his horse and
left him astraddle of the strap i know
that for a fact

  a giant of a man bearded to the eyes

although the front portion of his head was
bald joined billings by the stove where the
captain was warming his boots as
kichinskoi had made no mention of meat
and drink the adventurer did not choose to
remind the company that he was hungry
to eat in such a crowd was distasteful to
him

  to purgatoiy with satan growled the
newcomer billings recognized the voice
of the singer  i am the starshim mitrassof
colonel of the volga cossacks and by the
heavens i know the different handiwork of
witches and vampires vampires climb up
behind horsemen first they stupefy the
traveler with a poisonous breath then they
suck the mans blood until he is half-drained
kd goes abdut for the rest of his life like
an idiot or a cripple

  a vampire takes the form of a child
nodded the starshim always wasnt
this one like a boy or girl captain

a stripling and a rapscallion at that
of course mitrassof pointed to the
slit in the leg of billings trouser ai-a
brother you had it there dont you feel
faint

  somewhat-yes devilishly faint

  there was no doubt about that billings
having gone hungry since dawn

  well that settles it within a week
your limbs will begin to shrivel too bad
too bad you should have dismounted at
once and stuck your dagger in the ground
and made the sign of the cross three times
a vampire cant stand that he would have
run down the dagger and into the ground
i have a better trick than that spoke
up another when a little girl vampire
out on the tatar steppe tried to seize my
leg i cut off her head with my saber-poiij
like that then when i reined in and rode
back to see if she had changed into an
animal the body was gone it was night
a moon like this and i heard an old woman
wailing in the thicket

  true true nodded mitrassof vam-
pires are more daring than witches every
time

  kichinskois thin lips wore a skeptical
smile he was sitting on a couch fitted
with a silk cover beside him was a plump
german woman hisnistress she wore an
enormous round crinoline in the new fashion
and made great play with a fan

  the woman with her airs contrasted
grotesquely with the bare beams of hewn

pine and the tiled stove kichinskoi
sprawled at ease receiving compliments
from his entourage as a prince might

  mitrassofs explanation had cleared the
air for billings he was no longer bothered
and a hum of voices rose drowning the notes
of a balalaika strumming somewhere in the
shadows suddenly talk and music ceased

  a young lieutenant of polish dragoons
had entered saluted mitrassof and come to
a stand before the pristof billings noticed
that the nerves of the assembly seemed not
of the best and that every one listened to
hear what the newcomer had to say

  he had been out with a patrol across the
river he had to report that the torgut
chieftains were in council and preparations
were under way among the yurts for a move-
ment of some kind cattle were being
herded

  cattle kichinskois brows went up
you come to me with a tale that children
are herding tatar cattle what rot

  the pole flushed he was a youngster
in gallant attire in damask surtout and gilt
spurs and obviously had thought he had
done something well worth while

  but its at night excellency and the
fires are going in all the family tents
fires youll be assuring me next that
the savages are eating breakfast

  they are excellency

  kichinskoi snorted the woman beside
him hid her laugh behind a fan the under-
officials smirked in harmony when the
pristof set the tune it was up to them to
dance attendance mitrassof alone became
moody at the tidings brought by the pole

   but excellency that is not all tatar
outlaws have unsheathed the sword on the
volga a band of them attacked and slew
a cossack sotnik approaching zaritzan on
the ice with a sled from astrakan

  your mother blessed you with little
sense lieutenant come a few robbers
plunder a sled-you see a rising

  a crash startled the listeners mitrassof
had flung upon the floor the glass of brandy
he was holding his beard was bristling

  my men slain-by torguts hey there
shall be an answer for that i scent
treachery his scowling glance swept the
room and fell upon billings my soldiers
were convoying your instruments and
luggage

  then sir they were a cursed poor
convoy

  mishap upon mishap had fallen billings
way in the last few hours except the
clothes he stood in and his weapon he was
now stripped of the last of his worldly
possessions now captain billings was no
believer in that faithless jade fortune
scratch bad luck he would say and you
find somebodys ill-will somebody had
planned to steal his belongings

  you say that-you mitrassofs temper
flared you talked with one of the spawn
of satan and gave up to him your horse
so that he could escape us eh i can see
under a haystack like this one a tatar
rider leaves you gives you his tribal emblem
to wear

  now the boy alashan or whoever he
was must have exchanged belts with the
map-maker in the darkness certainly
billings had known nothing of it the death
of his men had driven all metaphysical fancies
from the cossacks head inflamed by drink

  you have sold yourself to the torguts
and you came here to spy upon the fortress

  good-natured ordinarily mitrassofs
savage moody soul was violent when his
feelings were roused billings could have
answered that it was absurd that he should
arrange for his baggage to be stolen or to
permit his own horse to be made away with
voluntarily

  instead he held his peace and glanced
at kichinskoi it was up to the pristof
to clear him but kichinskoi was frowning
his thin lips pinched together he was not
displeased at the quarrel because the cos-
sacks words showed him how he might pos-
sibly humble billings

  suddenly the german woman who had
been whispering to the pole spoke up
shrilly

  a mounted patrol pursued the robbers
excellency and the sergeant in command
reports that the leader of the tatars was
riding the horse of captain billings he
saw the captain riding in astrakan

  ha suspicion leaped into kichinskois
gray eyes he pondered the possibility that
billings could have been sent by beketoft
to stir up the tatars to revolt the sus-
picion died to be replaced by a shrewd
gleam of satisfaction

  kichinskoi knew that he had sent for
billings himself that both the captain and
beketoff were above such conspiracy but
he saw a way to gain a fresh hold he
thought on the map-maker


adventure

  meanwhile mitrassof was reasoning along
other lines or rather had ceased to reason
at all

  if you were a man and not a runt id
teach you a thing or two with a sword he
growled

  instantly billings blade was out twice
the flat of the heavy campaign rapier
slapped the cossacks red cheeks it stung
mitrassof to blind fury

  to one of us death  he gritted sweep-
ing out his saber

  there was no thought of seconds no
bothering about the code of duelists the
pole it is true tried to herd the fluttering
women out of the room kichinskoi seeing
that his sofa was well out of the combatants
way leaned forward curiously hitherto
no one in zaritzan had cared to match
strokes with the giant ataman he might
still have prevented the fight but made no
move to do so

  billings was smiling his teeth shining
under the yellow mustache a swift sliding
thrust severed a corner of the cossacks
black beard it was a clever trick ap-
preciated by the watching soldiers and it
brought a wild glare into the widened eyes
of the big cossack

 akhl he cried to one of us-
death

  his saber flashed and fell until the clash-
ing of the two blades was merged into a
single ringing grind billings stood close
in giving no ground keeping the weapons
engaged close to the hilts where the sweep
of the saber was- less potent

  mitrassof was a slow thinker when his
muscles were not in play but he moved
with alert swiftness springing back he
gained space for a full stroke and smote
down at his adversarys head the blow
would have broken the others blade like a
wooden lath billings however was not
there when the saber fell

  consternation began to grow in the faces
of the watching officers kichinskoi sprang
up with a muttered command to stop the
fight the young pole shook his head it
was too late

  but in the eyes of the woman on the sofa
was a morbid eagerness she was watching
for the moment when one of the swordsmen
would be pierced through or slashed into
oblivion so blinding was the play of
weapons she feared that she might miss the
instant of the blow

  stop them cried kichinskoi or they
are both lost

  both men were necessary to his plans

  mitrassof was cutting at the smaller
mans ribs no longer could billings step
aside the rapier darted at the cossacks
beard and rasped the skin from the jaw
bone

  stung anew the giant stepped forward
slashing without intermission he walked
across the room literally bearing billings
down before him yet as he came forward
the rapier caught once in his arm and again
in his ribs

  feeling his wounds mitrassof grinned
the blood running into his teeth and choking
him billings halted crouching his sword
upright and for a second the two blades
were locked the faces of the two were not
a yard apart

  a black arm caught at the chest of each
man and the priest obe thrust himself be-
tween them straining to push them apart

  in the name of god forbear he cried
keeping his grip with difficulty

  billings wrenched free and stood ready
to engage again

  the pristof hurried up

   quarreling in my presence he exclaimed
colonel captain this wont do at all
gentlemen-

  the panting mistrassof paid as much
attention to kichinskoi as to a wandering
fly but the pale face of the priest kept in
front of him

  this is the command of the church
do you hear cossack there was the
ring of authority in his thin voice

  mitrassof became calmer and sheathed
his saber scowling at billings he stared obe-
diently at the priest as a dog at its master

  i will remember this in your favor
kichinskoi was moved to say to father obe

  the priest seemed flurried by the con-
descension blinked and became once more
his unobtrusive self

  when the gathering left the room billings
noticed that mitrassof remained behind
he returned to the door and saw that the
cossack was busied rubbing a mixture of
gunpowder and earth on the cuts in his jaw
and arm moving stiffly to favor the side
where his ribs had been slashed

  also he had foraged for himself some cold
mutton and bread this he began to munch
while he sought for a brandy bottle that
still had some liquor in it
the road of the giants



  noticing the adventurer his beard
bristled in a grin

  hey that was a good bout he observed
you are the devil of a fellow to tackle

  billings bowed stiffly but yearned toward
the cold meat suspecting this mitrassof
pushed the platter toward his guest the
duel had restored his good humor and cleared
his head and he ignored his hurts they
found brandy and billings relaxed

  youre a swordsman yourself colonel

  lifting his glass mitrassof bowed

  not at all he muttered politely you
are my master with the blade aye you
would have let out my life before i could
have cut you down health to you

  health to you

  with a nod billings responded to the
toast and fell to attacking the mutton he
began to like mitrassof they talked long
over the bottle and the cossacks song was
not lacking when dawn outlined the win-
dows the colonel conducted the visitor to
his room

  mitrassof insisted that billings occupy
his pallet the big ataman went over to
some skins in a corner flung himself down
like a dog and was snoring almost at once

chapter ii

kichinskoi writes

  when smoke is in the sky somebody has made a
torch-cossack proverb

the next day rumors sprang up from
no one knows where along the volga
it was whispered among the huts of the
fishermen that the devil himself had been
seen walking along the opposite bank as
high as the stars and with eyes that flamed
like two pine torches and after his passing
a star had been seen to glow with uncanny
fire in the east

  it was observed that the cossacks in
mitrassofs command were moodier than
usual which might have meant either aching
heads after a night of drinking or a sense
of foreboding in these half-wild men who
were blood kin to the tatars

  heedless of rumors or portents the great
commissioner kichinskoi sat at his table
penning a report to the russian ministry
in it he gave the lie to his rival beketoffs
warnings concerning a revolt of the tatars
and suggested that the eldest son of each
family of the noyons-the torgut nobles-

be taken as hostage and brought up in
russian cities for these savages do seem
to cherish great affection for the oldest boy
in the family

 with even more zeal he composed a
memorandum to the treasurer of the em-
press explaining that he had found a man
who would undertake the perilous task of
making a survey for a trade route across the
steppe as far east within the countries of the
tribes- as lake balkash a stranger would
not be looked upon with suspicion by the
tatars who were jealous of their rights
and seemed to dislike all russians being
under the influence of an arch-witch from
tibet who was most likely a harmless
mummer

  kichinskoi then sent a servant to find
billings and bring him to the office the
man returned declaring that the english
captain had asked for a horse and gone off
in the direction of the river billings had
called back that he was about to look for the
miscreant who had taken his luggage and
horse

  ashes of sodom muttered the pristof
the fellow must love trouble he
thought for a moment bring the batko to
to me

  when father obe entered kichinskoi bade
him close the door and stand against it

  as soon as captain billings - returns
take him my compliments and this private
word

  complaints have reached me that he is
holding unauthorized intercourse with the
tatars especially with one who is called
alashan the son of the khan alashan is
an escaped hostage of the russian govern-
ment and the holy church i have proof
that captain billings aided alashan to
escape our hands captain billings is also
charged by worthy persons with possessing
a talisman belonging to the pagan sorcerer
of the torguts he is guilty of a brawl with
the worthy ataman in fact even i can not
prevent his being taken to moscow and
tried unless he pledges himself to a course
of conduct more becoming an employee of
the russian government hm- 

  he considered

  tell him furthermore that i have proof
under my hand that he is attempting to
incite the tatars to rebellion hint that
governor beketoff his patron is in dis-
favor at court whereas my star is rising
in short batko point out that if he chooses


adventure

to escape jail he must show his zeal for the
empress by serving me in the matter of the
map without any pay-no without any
money other than for his expenses

  smilingly kichinskoi reflected that bill-
ings would know better than to drive a bar-
gain with him again

  without a word father obe rose and left
after murmuring his assent whatever
thoughts came into his narrow secretive
mind he kept to himself after all there
was the belt

  the message was never delivered

  well pleased with the days beginning
the pristof was even more delighted when
his servant announced the arrival of a
delegation from the torguts

  ha-that does not smell of rebellion on
my word well bring my sable coat and
the sword of ceremony is that cursed
cossack ataman sober enough to walk with-
out staggering

  i think not excellency

  well order him to become so rub snow
on his bald pate and scrape some of the filth
off him hurry see that the tatars keep
outside the fortress by the way who are
they

  a hideous creature your highness and
alashan the son of the khan

  i expected his father hm alashan
kichinskoi looked pleased let me see
the seven infan try regiments of general
traubenberg and several batteries of
cannon-important things those-are with-
in four days march to the west then in-
struct the ataman to turn out the guard
with fixed bayonets mind the bayonets
humming to himself kichinskoi sum-
moned his valet and was attired in an
officers uniform freshly polished boots
dress sword and jeweled decoration at his
throat he took snuff liberally from the
imported box until he saw mitrassof walking
stiffly across the parade ground toward him
at the head of a squad of cossacks

  although a little pale the big man was
none the worse apparently for blood-letting
or brandy kichinskoi allowed him to lead
the way until they passed through the gate
and saw the torguts then the pristof
stepped out in front

  the torguts were unarmed

  what is this

  kichinskoi pursed his lips and signed to
the interpreter

  an old man stepped forward from the

small group of tatars and lifted his hand
to his bronze bossed helmet in greeting
short bowed legs supported a powerful
body clad in a sleeveless fur tunic his
right arm moved with a rhythm of rippling
muscles

  i am norbo master of the horse herds
of the torguts

  kichinskoi was looking at the slender
youth beside norbo alashan was brave in
finery of green nankeen and red silk of
furred khalat and fur-tipped cap his fine
dark eyes were alight with some kind of
inward merriment

 great commissioner went on norbo
bluntly i have been sent to ask whether
it is true that the empress has ordered our
sons to be taken away to russia i await
your word

  to gain time to think kichinskoi pre-
tended displeasure and reminded norbo
that he should have lifted his hat at men-
tion of the empress

  according to mongol custom it was an
unpardonable rudeness to bare the head
during a conference of state norbo noticed
that kichinskois hat remained in place

  nay i shall not do it he retorted
the torguts are free bom the khan is
no vassal of the empress

 the khan your khan will do what i
tell him to he is no more than a chained
bear

  norbo lowered his eyes and was silent
while alashan smiled faintly saying what
is your word concerning the sons of the
torguts

  kichinskoi hesitated for he had received v
as yet no authority from the ministry to act
as he had suggested he was thinking
quickly and thinking of a new decoration
prestige influence at court-if he gutfssed
aright the secret plans of the great
catherine

  he made his decision and with it cast into
the scales the lives of two hundred thousand
human beings

  this is my answer he said and ordered
the cossacks to seize alashan mitrassof
grew red and muttered that envoys were
privileged

  bah whispered the pristof it is only
an escaped student i did not invite him
here are you going to obey my order

  am i going to obey an order

  the colonel pulled at his mustache and
looked upat the sky thoughtfully
the ioad of the giants



  when my empress the great catherine
says ataman there is work to be done or
a-good blow to be struck why then i tell
my children and lead them and god will-
ing they die that is right and as it should
be when the batko says to me  colonel
that son of a pig the sultan has been
tearing down christian churches again
or roasting worthy priests of the steppe
i get my horse turn out my barracks
and polish up the frontier a bit my
turn will come that is as it should
be

  but when you say to these tatar chiefs
come and hold council with meand then
order them to be trussed up and carted off
that is a different thing entirely give that
old bull yonder who calls himself norbo a
sword and if it is your wish i will stretch
him out on the ground for you in a twinkling
although i am somewhat stiff this morning
but if you want to pluck the young envoy
ill send a man to call your polish guards
to do it thats all i will do by the holy
faith

  kichinskoi looked black but there was
no help for it he fancied that the tatar
who had named himself the son of the khan
was laughing at him no sooner had the
polish dragoons come up and secured
alashan than mitrassof gave an order to
his men and marched off

  to the surprize of all the russians
norbo and the other tatars offered no
resistance as alashan was hurried to the
gate

  the son of the khan is the first ex-
plained kichinskoi to norbo later the
eldest boy of each family must come to

  here to the pristofs chagrin norbo fol-
lowed by the other torguts turned on his
heel and walked off without any leave-
taking the russians last words had
given him the answer he sought to his
question and being a tatar he did not
see the need of more words so kichinskoi
was left without an audience although he
never felt more like making a speech in
his life

  he was conscious of a shrewd exultation
a conviction of his own power had not
the tatars accepted his mandate without
resistance he felt sure that he kichinskoi
was playing at the regal game of empire and
deciding the destiny of a people and so
he was	-

it was near to the hour of sunset
when billings rode a steaming horse
into the river gate of the fort and
asked for mitrassof learning that the
ataman was out with the mounted patrols
that kept watch on the western bank of the
volga he turned over his pony to a serf
from the stables and began to walk toward
the commissioners house

  he was thoughtful because he had had
his first glimpse of the tatar steppe the
wide plain that began at the tip of the
caspian where it was below the level of the
sea and extended to the mountains that
separated china from the western world
from dawn until dark he had seen not so
much as a hillock in the white expanse of
snow save where the native villages huddled
in the hollows protected from the wind by
clumps of willows or oaks

  billings knew that like all desert areas
the plain now ice-coated would be blazing
hot in the summer months yet it was
fertile and the fine grazing was much
coveted by the torguts who seemed indif-
ferent to weather

  reflecting upon the actions of alashan
he saw now that the boy must have had
urgent need of a horse the night before
and he believed-correctly as he afterward
discovered-that the exchange of belts
formed part of the tatar ritual of anda
he was rather skeptical however about the
tie of brotherhood that the boy had knit
between them

  as he passed the door of the church
father obe came out locking it after him
shivering even in his heavy cassock the
priest hurried to join billings

  i tried to find the colonel father obe
observed billings seriously but i think
you-as kichinskois adviser-should hear
my word i have just come in from the
plain its true as holy writ that the native
clans are gathering the cattle herds are
being driven in from the villages to the
center of each urdus - clan supplies
are being packed into wagons yet i
saw no signs of mobilization nor any
cannon

  it is curious he added

  some days ago observed the priest
one of my converts a fisherman told me
that the anti-christ across the river-the
witch or fiend that wears a mask-had
called together the torgut council and urged
the khan to take up the torch and sword
i

adventure

and lay waste all the russian hamlets from
astrakan to orenburg

 hum and the khan

  refused but there is evil stirring and
you do wrong to wear the sign of the fiend
billings fingered the leather girdle and
smiled

  if some one will be so good as to give
me another belt-he shrugged im be-
ginning to think the road across the steppe
will not be without thorns you wished
to speak to me father obe

   i have been told- the priest began
  what is that

  the moon was coming up over the walls
of zaritzan it outlined before the english-
man the shape of a prisoner in the stocks
a big cossack was bent nearly double his
head and arms thrust through the holes of
a heavy plank

  the lower part of the mans face was
stained black and glistened in the faint
radiance from the sky billings saw that
he was in his shirt his heavy svitza thrown
on the ground under his nose the fellow
was shivering his eyes fixed so that billings
suspected the lids were frozen

  a sentry the priest explained who
let a prisoner slip through his fingers last
night when you captain reached zaritzan
this afternoon his excellency the pristbf
condemned him to have his nostrils torn
and to be locked in the stocks for twelve
hours without a coat

  bending closer billings recognized the
cossack who had first greeted him at the
pate of the fort even if he had retained
vitality enough to speak the frozen blood
that coated his lips would have rendered
the soldier dumb

  billings would have walked on when his
own words spoken that llst night came
into his mind-

  you would leave a christian to the cold
and wolves

  billings never wasted time in cogitation
he caught up the mans heavy skeepskin
coat flung it over his back tying the sleeves
under his throat and buttoning the lower
part around his hips the stiffened eyes
turned toward him gratefully

  tell the commissioner about this if you
want to he growled to father obe if he
objects present my compliments and remind
him that i do not happen to be his vassal
father obe glanced at the map-maker
curiously

   i shall say nothing my son the pristof
gave me a message for you you are a
brave man even if you hold commerce with
the pagans i-i shall let him deliver his
message himself

  but billings did not see kichinskoi at
dinner going from there to his room or
rather the one he shared with mitrassof-
for the castle was very crowded-he was
surprized to find a sentry with a musket
at the door the door too was bolted on
the outside when billings shot back the
bolt and would have entered the soldier
motioned him back

  i come from colonel mitrassof billings
said thinking the man was some guard of
mitrassofs

  indeed at the name of the officer the
soldier fell back respectfully

  yawning billings was preparing to take
off his shoes and coat and throw himself on
the cot when he saw that it was already
occupied alashan was surveying him with
considerable amusement

bless my eyes and blood
captain minard billings seated
himself on the three-legged stool by
the bed he sat very straight muscular
arms crossed two fingers tugging at the end
of a well waxed mustache

  you are the infernal scoundrel ive been
looking for all day

 where

  across the river this billings noticed
caused the boy to start where is my
pony

  soon you will bestride her

  hum and my luggage pray i have
learned that the youth who rode my mare
attacked the cossacks who were with the
sledge and that tatars shed christian
blood the gray eyes of the map-maker
grew cold  look here my bopobka my
little eh i have had my fill of mummery
tell a plain tale now and no tricks

  nay captain beel-ing- alashan could
never compass the others name-i did
not attack the cossack guard

  the brown eyes of the youth were wide
and clear his small mouth was gentle and
quick to speak scanning the boys olive
countenance billings wondered if there were
not persian blood in him at any rate it
seemed that alashan although tatars were
usually blunt and ill-schooled at deceit
could he like a baskir or persian
the road of the giants



   my lord brother- alashan had read his
thoughts-you are my anda my life for
yours and one pledge for the two of us the
tie was made fast when our girdles were
exchanged my tongue speaks no false
words to you some things i may not tell
as yet do but have patience

  patience billings folded his arms
well my prince brother by our anda let
me know this one thing what manner of
a glot are you hatching against the pristof
out on the steppe

  a change came over the boys expressive
face

  soon the great commissioner will be no
more than a chained bear but he himself
has forged the chains

   riddles what are you doing here

 i am a prisoner and i wait

 for what

  a scourging

  alashan related how he had been seized
and piyl into his present quarters-the other
rooms of the house being occupied by clerks
officers and friends of kichinskoi billings
reasoned that the pristof wished alashan
kept as near him as possible-a valuable
hostage for the good conduct of ubaka
khan also kichinskoi could report his
capture of alashan by whatever means
after beketoffs carelessness had permitted
the escape of the boy from astrakan

  he has said he will lash me went on
the torgut the blood darkening his cheeks
as a lesson to the tatars who attacked the
cossacks nay they were but boys and
the soldiers fired the first shot so the great
commissioner would lash the son of ubaka
who is the grandson of ayuka who was mas-
ter of the golden horde child of the royal
race of genghis khan kai-it is so but
the knout will not be laid upon my back
i am not sure you do not deserve it
alashan

  nay you will protect me

 i

  aye they will come when the night is
half gone it is nearly time

  indeed i will do no such thing

 billings shook his head decisively
whether merited or not the whipping of
the boy was beyond his power to prevent

 you will do it until dawn you will
protect me

  alashan laughed merrily and billings was
surprized because he had never known a

tatar to laugh

  

  and at dawn i will ride free from this
house and these walls-aye though there
be a great stupid yak with a musket outside
your door and three thousand like him
within call and you will go with me as
my lord brother should

  a sound of iron-heeled boots in the pas-
sage stiffened the boys lips all in a mo-
ment his eyes widened and he grew whitish
around the mouth

  they are coming with the knout cap-
tain beel-ing hurry lock the door

  on the doors of the pristof s house there
were bolts on both sides for locking in
prisoners or bolting out thieves as circum-
stances might require billings had already
noticed this but made no move to obey
you will not let them use the knout on

me persisted the stripling look-

  for the first time alashan removed the
large velvet cap trimmed with fur a flood
of glossy black hair descended upon the
tatars slim shoulders and slipped down to
the bed itself

  the olive cheeks that had been pale grew
softly red billings knew that most of the
tatars wore a kind of long mane of hair
but this mass of curling locks belonged to a
woman and the face was that of a woman

  a rap resounded on the door billings
glanced at the rusty bolt and thrust out
his boot against the lower edge of the door

  excellency he heard a soldier say we
will take away the tatar prisoner if you
will have the kindness to open to us

  at the same time he felt that the heavy
door was tried from without it did not
give

  in a moment he called over his shoul-
der he looked at alashan

  captain beel-ing i am not the son of
the khan do you think the horde would
give the son of a chief to another king nay
i am only a girl

  as she spoke she tore off the voluminous
khalat that had been about her shoulders

  in the name of mercy you must believe
me my name is nadesha and when the
order came for alashan to go to astrakan
i said i would go instead i have persian
blood in me i know the ways of the rus-
sians and i had wit enough to slip out of
any noosfe they made for me

agreed to that whispered billings
are you the daughter of the khan ubaka
nay i am nadesha the child of norbo
who is master of the herds word came
i

adventure

to me to escape from astrakan god was
kind you aided me so i made you my
anda today i came with norbo to see if
that old buzzard kichinskoi was really
ordered to make slaves of the torgut youths
it is so you do not think i am a girl
hereupon nadesha who had unbuttoned
the cotton jacket she had worn under the
khalat began to jerk at the neck of her shirt
with anxious fingers

  you must not give me to the soldiers
who would strip me and take me to kichin-
skoi when they find i am not alashan-

  hold on enough billings ruddy
cheeks grew redder i believe you
excellency came the summons from
without open the door and we will not
trouble you more

  billings searched the room with his glance
a collection of weapons belonging to mitras-
sof had been removed when nadesha was
installed there was left only the bed the
stool an ikon on the wall and a miscel-
laneous mass of fine though soiled garments
piled by the skins

  at ms whispered order nadesha ran
through this array of velvet and satin
clothes but no womans attire was to be
seen among the spoil of mitrassofs forays
she looked at billings who frowned

  it was bad enough for him to be sus-
pected of conspiring with the tatars with-
out having to deal with a fair yoiing witch
witch he could see kichinskoi and father
obe burning her because her presence here
certainly savored of magic and it was more
palatable for the official to claim that he
had been bewitched than befooled 

  nadesha took matters into her own hands
swiftly enough she thrust her khalat into
the pile of garments took off her boots-
too large for her bare feet-and shook down
the masses of glossy hair over her shoulders
then she kicked out the candle

  come in she called pleasantly no
longer simulating the deeper voice of a
boy

  a cossack sergeant pushed open the
door-billings withdrawing his foot barely
in time-and entered followed by a soldier
bearing a stained and smoky lanthorn

   come alashan he growled holding the
dirn light high in order to peer at the two
occupants of the room

  nedesha laughed and cracked her fingers
the lanthorn was moved over to her while
the soldiers inspected her then it was thrust

about the bare room finally coming to rest
over billings who had not stirred

  where is the son of the khan de-
manded the sergeant

  receiving no answer he looked under
the bed upon which nadesha kneeled hug-
ging her toes palpably the room did not
contain any one else

  the sergeant went out voices ensued
the sentry came in glanced around peered
at nadesha searched under the bed and
finally pushed his bayonet intd the pile of
clothes in the corner he even lifted the
skins on the floor

  then he faced the sergeant and scratched
his hair

  i saw alashan go in but he is not here
now

  the cossack inspected the hole of a
window

  large enough for a weasel he muttered
he saluted billings excellency have you
seen alashan the torgut

 no

  when did this maiden come in

  she was here when i arrived

  this brought more bewilderment to the
sheepish sentry no one he said had been
in the room when they put alashan there
not six hours ago nor had any one ex-
cept captain billings entered since

  very angry was the sergeant

  if alashan has escaped again youll be
eaten by the crows and ill have my nostrils
torn

  more than a little amused billings
listened to the debate going on between the
two the pristof should be summoned no
the pristof was asleep and he would consign
to thestrappado any one who awakened him
now well then the officer in command
of the watch a fine thing that-to put their
heads in the noose before it was tied
colonel mitrassof he was out with the
patrols

  sergeant observed billings leaning
back against the wall with folded arms if
you have finished with your questions you
might find time to reflect that an officer may
sometimes desire to talk to a pretty woman
undisturbed

  yes excellency the man drew himself
up and saluted

  undisturbed

  pardon

  the cossack prepared to leave glaring
about him suspiciously
the road of the giants	

   sergeant for your own sake make your
report to colonel mitrassof and no other

  billings listened and was sure the two
remained outside his door although be-
wildered the soldiers were not minded to
release the prisoners-for billings would
now be watched he was committed now
to getting nudesha out of this mess light-
ing the candle he saw that the tatar girl
was curling up in the blankets preparing to
go to sleep

  not a bad idea thought billings and
sought the skins on the floor

  although he dozed one ear was conscious
of the coming and going of feet outside the
door he had fastened the inner bolt
presently the feet began to run through the
passage he was aware of shouts the hoof-
beats of a horse outside the house a touch
on his arm wakened him

  nadesha had put on the khalat but with-
out bidding up her hair he could see her
only vaguely by the glow of sunrise through
the window

  come brother she whispered

  billings was alert at once aroused by the
tumultin the castle looking from the panes
of mica in the window he whistled softly

  against the spreading crimson of sunrise
in the east there rose numberless columns of
smoke the whole sky was full of these
black pillars so that the very dawn was the
hue of blood listening to the outcry in
the castle he made out fragments the
tatars have risen    the world is burn-
ing up    where are the torguts their
villages are burning

  standing tip-toe beside him nadesha
stared at the conflagration she uttered a
soft cry of lament or joy he did not know
which tugging him after her she drew
back the bolt and pushed open the door

  the sentry faced her dull with lack of
sleep his musket at the ready billings
halted but nadesha knocked up the gun
with a quick motion-she moved as swiftly
as an animal-and drew from within her
cloak a long pistol billings recognized it
as his

  thfusting the weapon into the soldiers
beard she backed him against the wall of
the corridor

  you little vixen 

	billings caught at her but she slipped
away running fleetly in her bare feet the
map-maker dashed after her leaving the
sentry fingering his weapon and cursing

not daring to shoot for fear of hitting the
officer

  down the passageway they went into an
empty hall and through a door that gave
upon a lighted chamber this proved to
be the office of kichinskoi and the pristof
himself sat at the table

  he wore a purple dressing-gown and his
hair was tousled he was alone as billings
ran into the room the door was swung shut
behind him and wheeling he saw nadesha
standing against it flushed with triumph a
pistol in each small fist

  with her bare feet planted wide her
tangled hair falling into her gleaming eyes
the girl was a veritable wildcat kichinskoi
stared at her with surprized anger until
comprehension came to his alert mind

  you are alashan

  i am nadesha child of norbo faster
of the herds listen to my word you who
would chain the torguts like a bear-who
would eat of the fat of the bear and wear his
skin to keep you warm

  she gestured with a pistol and kichinskoi
pressed back in his chair billings could see
the pristof s tongue moving spasmodically
owing to the tumult in the castle it would
avail the man nothing to shout nor by
the discipline he enforced among those under
his rule was there a chance that any one-
except mitrassof-would enter without
permission

  kichinskoi was cornered and he was help-
less billings had an idea that in her present
mood nadesha would think nothing of
pistoling them both

  blind the girls cry went on you
and your empress would make slaves of the
free born fool you did not see that we
will not submit many there were who
brought the truth for your hearing you
shut your ears now have you seen the
smoke in the sky

  a nod from kichinskoi who was gather-
ing his wits about him

  the torguts are burning their villages
the bear is throwing off its shackles we
are marching-now-to the east wte are
riding to our homeland the clan of the
torguts will go back to lake balkash and
beyond to the river ili where you can not
follow the khan has chosen-yesterday-
after your word

  she cast a fleeting glance out of the win-
dow that was mellow with sunrise kichin-
skoi started
adventure

  impossible he muttered a years
journey and-two hundred thousand
souls his eyes narrowed you would
be attacked by your enemies the baskirs
and the black kirghiz why the
snow-

  he almost laughed feeling that the girl
was deceiving him

  nadesha smiled tauntingly

  we have chosen pristof this is my
word from the council of the torguts if
you send your soldiers to turn us back there
will be war and a river of blood upon the
snow from the volga to balkash i have
said it

  with the pistol still in her hand she
raised it to her forehead and then dropped
it to her lips in mock salaam

  i could slay you my fine boar but you
are already dead my lord beketoff
already is driving a racing sledge to st
petersburg with a word for the ear of your
empress that will stretch you out under
the snow

  jumping up kichinskoi stared at her as
if nadesha had been truly a witch

  you see pristofshe said calmly i
have learned a lot at your school to
billings she added if you want your
pistols my little anda come and get them

  with that she was gone through the door
as swiftly as she had come billings guessed
that the girl would not stay within the
building she must make for the stables
and secure a horse-if she could-as her
best chance of freedom before kichinskois
men overtook her

  knowing better than to try to pursue her
billings ran out of the other door through
the dining-hall and the courtyard behind
him kichinskoi remained pale and rigid as
if he had seen his death sentence written
on the wall

  billings found the gray light obscured by
mists over the drill ground soldiers were
running to stations cossacks who buckled
belts and slid into overcoats as they ran
from the watch-tower a bugle blared the
meti paid no heed to him or to nadesha

  as he had hoped the captain sighted the
long cloak and flying hair of the girl disap-
pearing into the mist she was looking
back over her shoulder somewhat to his
surprize she was heading not toward the
stables but to a gate through which horse-
men were coming and going freely men from
the mounted patrols coming in and couriers

going forth the usual strict scrutiny was
relaxed owing to the absence of both
mitrassof and kichinskoi and the general
disturbance caused by the conflagration

  in the shreds of mist nadesha seemed
like a floating wraith slipping over the snow
just within the gate billings sighted a large
sleigh and recognized by its gilded orna-
ments and pompons that it was the one
used by kichinskoi himself

  beside it the young polish lieutenant sat
his horse restlessly into the sleigh was
climbing the plump woman who was
kichinskois mistress her maid lugging
bandboxes and shawls was trying to get
in beside her not ten feet away stood the
stocks and from the frozen body of the
imprisoned cossack two blind eyes stared
at the tumult around the sleigh the man
had died in the night

  in response to nadeshas call three horse-
men emerged from the dense shadows of the
wall they wore ragged sheepskin svitzas
and nondescript black felt hats

  billings however perceived that they
were no peasants he recognized the harsh
features and immense shoulders of norbo
master of the herds another was a youth
of about nadeshas age the three evi-
dently knew exactly what was expected of
them

  norbo spurred up to the pole who drew
a pistol from a saddle holster but not quickly
enough to avoid a sweep of the club in
norbos hand the pistol was knocked into
the snow the pole himself caught up
whirled from his mount and flung to earth

  meanwhile the other two had frightened
off the two grooms with a flourish of bared
sabers nadesha as usual had not been
idle seizing the maid by the shoulders
the girl pulled her back screaming like a
wounded parrot the bandboxes flew
about and the horses attached to the sleigh
began to rear

  the german woman had risen and the
forward jerk of the sleigh tumbled her back
nadesha wormed into the vehicle and fell
to rolling the frightened fugitive out of it
norbo rode up impatiently and put an end
to this by leaning over and pulling the
woman bodily out of rugs and sleigh
nadesha screamed something up at the
tatar who turned and looked at billings

  the captain had come to a halt one of
the tatars the young boy spurred toward
him billings drew his sword
the road of the giants



  alashan cried nadesha her voice shrill
with fear

 men were running toward them the
pole having rolled out from under the
horses feet was shouting for aid

  the boy who had been called alashan did
not stop he swung his saber slowly as he
galloped from the direction of the bar-
racks came a ruddy flash and the roar of a
musket

  then billings hrd boots thudding in the
snow behind him he could not turn for
alashan was almost on him something
struck against the base of his neck and a
great crackling filled his ears a red sea
formed in front of his eyes he felt a hand
catch his arm then all was darkness

  above the roaring in his head persisted
the shrill squawking of the fat woman who
had been thrown in the snow

chapter iii

the fight at ukim pass

only for a moment can you sayi am the slayer

he the slain

  the shrill joy-cries of the women at your wedding
change to lamentation at your death bed-native
proverb

in the year of the tiger by the mongol
calendar alashan was seventeen years
of age this was one year older than
nadesha but the girl of norbo bom of a
persian mother grew swiftly to womanhood

  alashan was still a boy intent on sports -
and leader of a gang of torgut rascals who
tended the horse herds racing the best of
the beasts almost into the ground in their
pastimes

  these other boys of the torgut nobles
were brawnier than alashan true he
could ride with a fiery eagerness that won
him races yet in the goat tamasha he could
not hold his own although he rode until his
lungs labored and his heart rose in his
throat the goat tamasha in which each
rider tries to capture and keep from the
others a live goat is a furious test of an
hour or more during which clubs and
cracked heads are often the lot of the
contenders

  you are worse than a hair on the eye-
ball nadesha had assured him spitefully
after one defeat how do you ever expect
to be a man and kill an enemy when you
cant even keep a goat in your hand

  life for the tatar youths in the age when
the great clans were still intact was an
ordeal in the stag-hunts they had to
follow the grown men often from sunrise
to sunrise without eating and without pause
except to rest the horses the wild-swine
hunts by torch and moonlight where
thickets coated the valleys were less arduous
but more hurtful many an overbold
stripling had the calves of his leg ripped
apart by angry tuskers and some were
ham-strung

  alashans body was more delicate his
eyes deeper than usual he was much given
to hanging around the councils of the older
men even listening for hours to the whis-
perings of the lama-the priest from tibet-
who was very willing to inculcate supersti-
tion and fear into the mind of the future
khan

  so it was from a two-fold fear that ubaka
his father had sent nadesha in his place
disguised as a boy to astrakan he was
afraid the russians might influence the
queer mind of his son against him

  nadesha is more of a man than alashan
he had said bitterly to norbo who being
too blunt to he said nothing

  the khan was a broad man less muscular
than norbo more ponderous with the
strength of a bull he was not clever and
care sat upon him heavily

  listen alashan he had said to the
boy to the words spoken by the all-
conquering the mighty monarch genghis
who when he christened our clan spoke in
this fashion you shall be called the
giants from birth your sons will have a
sword in their hands and they will die so
there will be no peace for you that is not
won by blood and suffering in the stars
it is written you will be free men until the
hour of your passing you are the giants

  it was the longest speech alashan had
ever heard his silent father make it
lingered in his mind like the after-note of a
bell

  wien you have proved yourself a man
in the face of your enemies the khan
added  then you shall ride on my left side
not now

  often while he sat by the hearth in the
wooden palace of his father on the steppe
near zaritzan alashan thought upon these
words so far he reasoned the words of
genghis khan had proved true the

   torguls


adventure

torguts had migrated westward from china
to keep their freedom for a hundred and
fifty years they had fought the battles of
the russians so that they might hold the
steppe upon which their herds grazed

  for a hundred and fifty years the sword
had been in their hands what now
alashan while ubaka was absent on the
last campaign against the turks and
nadesha away in astrakan listened to the
talk of the women on the other side of the
fireplace

  he heard that the levies of cattle and
money paid by the torguts to the empress
were to be increased he himself had seen
the forts going up around the territory of
the torguts

  when ubaka rode home at the head of
his men alashan waited in vain for a word
of praise or reward from the russians and
his anger grew ubaka became more silent

  one day ubaka told norbo to send for
nadesha and called the torgut council to-
gether after long talk that the boy did not
hear a rumor sprang up on the steppe

  we are going to the home of our fathers
the elder torguts said

  loosang lama the priest from tibet was
consulted and approved the plan for reasons
of his own the omens were taken from
burned sheeps bones and found to be favor-
able for the undertaking

  alashan was glad and hopeful although
the weeks of preparation made the labor of
the boys heavy he looked forward to the
setting out as a moslem boy might await his
first travel to mecca he mingled again
with his cronies they stole horses on a
dark night from the hostile baskirs-no
easy feat that they dipped kumiss by
stealth out of the big jars by the fire of their
various tents and were blindly drunk for
a while

  then to ease their spirits they attacked
a cossack sotnik one moonlight night on the
volga nadesha put this idea into alashans
head

  the girl had returned from astrakan on
a fine pony and with a brace of pistols that
roused alashans immediate envy she did
not show the weapons to any one else con-
fiding in the boy that they were borrowed
so was the horse nadesha admitted but
she let alashan ride it on his foray she
said there was something valuable on the
sledge and she dared him to take it

  to the tatar boys the chance of seizing

a sledge bearing plunder was a fine thing
to tackle cossacks was a big order but
on the following day they would be riding
away from volga and without doubt they
would all earn for themselves the name of
warrior

  despite alashans craft they were seen
by the cossack guard and fired upon before
they could approach keeping to the
shadows along the river bank they managed
to remain out of sight-until one of their
number was drilled through the head by a
chance bullet

  that let loose the devil in the boys who
until then had planned merely to try to run
off with the sledge when the cossacks halted
to make camp they rode their ponies out
on the ice and sent arrows swiftly into the
soldiers grouped by the sledge

  a musket is not so easily aimed as a bow
in the moonlight two more boys were
knocked from their horses and died soon
after but the three cossacks lay writhing
out their lives on the ice

  without a shout of triumph and without
plundering the victims the tataryouths
made off with the sledge and were seen
climbing the river bank by fishermen roused
by the shots

  you are no better than a child the
khan said to his son when alashan was
brought before him the next day kai
it is so when i would keep secret our
march you rouse the cossacks to fury and
our foes the baskirs you would bring upon
our heels go

  alashan would not confess that nadesha
had sent him upon the cossacks when he
sought out the girl in the bustle of their
village he found her preparing to go to
zaritzan with her father in his stead r

  but i am not afraid he cried

  that is not enough

  she made a face at him and to add to this
insult took his best kaftan carefully slitting
the inner lining to make a place for the two
pistols

  i am more of a man than you the khan
said it

  nothing could have made alashan more
utterly miserable he sat by the cold
hearth of the great log building that did
duty as a palace nadesha was fairly safe
for even kichinskoi alashan thought
would not lay hand on the son of the khan

  then came norbo with tidings of nade-
shas seizure taking pity on the boys
the road of the giants



anxiety the master of the herds allowed
him to share in the attempt to rescue the
girl the next morning nadesha had found
time to whisper to her father that she would
manage to be near one of the gates just
before sunrise and they had counted on the
alarm caused by the conflagration to aid
their escape

  for ubaka as soon as he heard the de-
cision of kichinskoi to take the torgut sons
had given the order to burn all the torgut
villages

 raise the tughhe gave command
after seeing that his abode was fired we
will go to our homeland

  smoke was already rising on every quarter
of the steppe the animals were restless
but when the yak-tailed standard was lifted
and the trumpets sounded the young boys
yelped with joy they were the first ip
move driving off the cattle then came the
women on horse with other beasts dragging
the heavy wagons on which stood the skin
tents

  children raced about in the snow dogs
barked the jigits outriding shouted to
other bands that appeared beside them on
the white sea of the steppe axles creaked
and horses neighed it all merged in one
vast joyous murmur

  the ili women cried to each other and
nodded as they whipped up the cattle draw-
ing the wagons

  ubaka khan grandson of ayuka sat
with the armed men on their horses waiting
to bring up the rear with steady eyes he
was looking into a sunrise that seen through
the smoke was the hue of blood this
ruddy glow tinged the brown faces that
passed the khan it dyed red the tossing
horns of the cattle two hundred thou-
sand humans had burned their homes and
were mustering for a march in the dead of
winter over one of-the most barren regions
of the earth

  even the trampled snow was a crimson
sea smoke hung above the moving shapes
like a shroud-a pall that disgorged black
cinders and ashes ubaka khan had never
seen such a sunrise

  behind him there was the sound of a soft
chuckling laugh he turned in his saddle
to see the immense emaciated form of
loosang lama at his elbow the mans
countenance was hidden behind a lacquer
mask half-animal half-human a loose
robe of the most vivid yellow hung slackly

from a bare left shoulder exposing the half of
a wasted body marked by knives and disease

  it was your word my khan whispered
the priest that sent them forth do not
forget

captain minard billings
had been struck by the butt of a
musket at the base of his skull so
that he lay long unconscious heedless of his
surroundings when he opened his eyes-it
hurt him to move them-nightmares were
still racing through the back of his brain

  ferried across the styx by jove
lying in a cave with the shade of hephaes-
tus looking out on the procession of
the lost and damned at last

  he rolled his eyes to encompass the other
side of the cavern-like abode

  and that wench circe sitting yonder
with her court of beasts poor gallants like
me egad more of the beasts homed and
hoofed laboring in front of the cave-
brimstone in the very air	

  at this muttering the figure of the woman
rose and placed a cold wet cloth behind his
head and another over his eyes her hands
were quick and tender and smelled some-
what of cows billings subsided

  when he woke from a long sleep he was
shivering it was colder than hades had
any right to be when she rose from her
corner to lay another sheepskin over him
billings recognized that circe was nadesha
wrapped in a white kaftan made of the soft
bellies of foxes he saw too that hephses-
tus was merely the grim and grotesque man
who had led the rescue of nadesha-norbo
as he learned later

  the master of the herds was pounding
at a steaming sword blade on a small anvil
on a stone hearth between him and billings
a fire roared filling the tent with smoke
huddled as far as possible from the fire
were a half-dozen odorous sheep the tent
made of deer and ox skins was stretched over
alder poles the whole being mounted on a
crude wagon drawn by ten brace of oxen

  billings groaned and shut his eyes this
was no nightmare he was stiff and weak
and shooting pains ran up into his skull but
his brain was cool nadesha surveyed him
with all the insolence of ownership and made
him drink some mixture in a bowl-mares
mills and wine seasoned with sugar and
pepper he coughed and swore under his
breath


adventure

  so she exclaimed angrily you let a
milk-guzzling boy and a russian yak stretch
you full length in the dirt pah i am
ashamed that i took such pains with you
my fine captain

  i did not expect an attack from the
castle who knocked me down

  as i said a russian soldier he ran out
from kichinskois door when alashan
and norbo had hauled you into the sledge
beside me-and what a mess you made of
alashans blue-i heard the pristof himself
call out for his men to take you prisoner
alashan cut down the man who hit you and
we got away with only a little fighting be-
cause the inist was still heavy on the river
and the patrols thought it was kichinskois
fat woman in the sledge

  kai you stupid milord kichinskoi
would have made of you fine bait to drag
across his trail true he hired you to make
him a map i have heard it said but now
his own bones will be summoned to the
emptess rack and he would have said that
you conspired with us and he caught you
and perhaps they would have pulled your
joints apart instead

  it was significant that nadesha thought
of the russian government in terms of the
knout and the strappado and the rack

 was that why you carried me off
nadesha

  partly i want you to do something for
me too you must do it

  hum seems to me im always doing
something for you nadesha wheres my
pony that you promised me confound it
youve got my sword now

  he had just seen it hanging with the
brace of pistols on the tent wall over
nadeshas corner

  you are my anda captain beel-ing i
keep the weapons or they would be stolen
here is your pony

  she pulled back a segment of the skin
wall a kind of adjustable window and
billings saw his horse in a small herd driven
beside the yurt by a tatar rider

  here are your treasures

  like a magpie with a cache to be exhibited
but not touched nadesha flitted over to
where she had made a temporary couch-
billings was occupying her own bed
throwing aside the skins she disclosed a
number of bags that billings recognized as
those containing his personal kit his spare
stock of paper powder and tobacco also

the sandalwood box in which he kept an
astrolabe spirit level compass globe
dividers and rule-all his paraphernalia for
observation and drafting nadesha had
been using it as a pillow billings grunted
with joy and then winced with pain because
he had moved

 what do you want me to do he
muttered

  you are a prisoner she assured him
this morning thirty russns blundered
into our line of march and were slain be-
cause the cossacks are following and our
men were frightened where we are going
we can take no christians you would be
left for the wolves if i did not take your
part do you understand

  billings understood very well but said
nothing

  i want you to make a map declared
the girl

  he waited

  is it true my anda what men said in
astrakan that you can look at the sun and
the stars and take your instruments in your
hands as a lama takes his bones and prayer
roll and tell on what spot of the earth you
stand eh

  it is true

  then you know temii-kazyk the polar
star and jitti karaktchi the great bear and
all the others you can tell what lies ahead
and on each hand just by looking at the
sun and the stars

  true

   kai-that is wonderful then you must
draw a map of the road that we take it
was for that i brought you here

  where are you going

  to the lake that is balkash from which
the river hi flows

  billings looked up in surprize this
then was the route that kichinskoi had
planned for him the map was the one he
was commissioned to make

  then make the map and watch always
if we are journeying truly toward balkash
if our march turns aside tell me of it
but do not speak to any one else or ubaka
khan himself could not save your life

  now the armenian merchant of astrakan
had described to billings the location of
balkash which was known to the caravans
as the lake was large a sort of landmark of
central asia the caravan routes from
china to russia passed along it and turning
south those to india and tibet
the road of the giants



  i shall need accurate information
brought in daily by riders who have
been out to the north and south he
hazarded

  nedesha clapped her hands

  verily our line of march is wide very
wide so that the horses can all graze under
the snow and fodder for the cattle can
be had the torgut clans stretch to the
north and south ten miles and outriders
go twenty more on each flank some
hunters questing for game go much far-
ther aye they shall bring in reports
to the master of the herds i shall ar-
range it

  and what is your part of the bargain-
my anda he forced himself to ask

first promise you will make the map
and tell me if we turn away from the road
to balkash

  so long as i am with your tribe i will
do it

  good then i can promise that when
we reach balkash you will be set free with
horse weapons and goods and followers to
take you where you wish seeing the
mans face set stubbornly she added cap-
tain beel-ing you are in the heart of the
tatar horde if you escaped from this
clan-the wolf clan of norbo-you would
have to pass through a score of others on
the steppe then you would fall into the
hands of the cossacks and be taken before
kichinskoi who sent a soldier to strike you
down before his gate

  billings said nothing he knew as well as
nadesha that the frightened pristof would
leave no stone unturned to avert from him-
self the deadly anger of the russian court
at the loss of the torguts a good case as
it happened could be made out against him
billings had no friends to use influence on
his behalf mitrassof might speak a word
for him-but mitrassof was if nadeshas
information proved correct now in the
field against the torguts

  in common with kichinskoi billings did
not believe that the great tribe could escape
beyond the reach of the russian armies
by the time they were headed off and turned
back to the volga billings might be able
to communicate with mitrassof if he stayed
with the torguts he glanced around the
dark tent odorous with smoke and sheep
and set his teeth resolving at the first
opportunity to seek word with the ataman
rather than endure months of this prison

on wheels meanwhile he would work at
his chart it would give him something to
occupy his mind

  what makes you think he asked for
this puzzled him  that your khan and his
riders may turn aside from the road to
balkash

  nadesha glanced out of the opening at the
entrance of the yurt no one was at the
front of the wagon she had fancied she
heard a slight movement near by leaning
her dark head close to the prone man she
whispered from here to the river yaik
and from there across the steppe to the
great river torgai we know well the way
beyond there we have only the tales of our
fathers and the wisdom of loosang who
knows all things who came from the temple
of the lamas in the mountains to the south
of our road i have heard old riders of the
steppe say that devils are in those moun-
tains-devils with faces of beasts who fall
upon the caravans and carxy off women
such as i

  a shadow crossed the girls face

  tchu-i fear to go among the long
cold mountains i want to go to the
river ili where the sun smiles on the hot
grass

  billings laughed at this child-like con-
fidence but nadesha looked up with a
start she had heard the flap of the tent
that served as window drop into place the
strip of skin was still moving dart-
ing to the entrance she crawled out
to spring to the ground and look about
she saw only the herd of horses and its
driver

  on the other side of the yurt his teeth
set and his eyes savage alashan spurred
away plying his whip as if one of the thou-
sand devils had climbed up behind him
nadesha and the son of the khan had been
betrothed in childhood the bride-pay-
ment had already been added to the herds
of norbo

  unless one of the two fathers should de-
clare alashan unworthy of the bargain the
beautiful girl would belong to him now
he had seen her black head pressed against
the yellow mane of the giaour the out-
lander he had heard talk in the yurts that
nadesha had made the stranger her anda
lie had come to ask the girl whether or not
this were true what he had seen would
lead alashan inevitably to fight billings and
if possible to kill him


adventure

now when the chains of winter
were tightened upon the steppe all
life human and animal crept out
of sight the cold was intense although
the sky was clear and the suns touch fell
full on the deep blanket xf snow that it
could not soften

  in the fir belts animal life kept together
instinctively-elk and the following wolf
packs that ranged from forest to river
even the rivers were motionless ice coating
their surfaces yet across this frozen world
moved a black river it was a stream of
fur-clad humans and as village after village
was met with and the smoke of them left
behind the column grew to an army the
army to a horde

  the sound of it became a never ending
mutter compounded of the groaning of
hard-driven beasts laboring wagons and
toiling men and this muttering horde of
men going as no people had gone before
was unwonted it broke as one might say
the chains set about the steppe it challenged
the wilderness before it as if in mute
evidence of this the elk herds the wild
swine even the panthers fled out of its
course

  but behind it the wolf packs began to
gather tearing to pieces the cattle and
horses and sheep that fell by the way

  a whole people has gone mad men
who had come to look at the moving
columns from a distance said they will
go to their graves like beds

  others cossacks examining the trafil of
the horde pointed out the forbidding signs
of hoof marks mingled with the tread of
human feet and the black embers of fire in
the isolated hamlets the clans had passed over

  these cossacks of mitrassof as well as
the polish regiment were closing in on the
torguts the head of a viper cut off from
the body still retains its poisonous fangs
kichinskoi in the last agonies of mortified
conceit and dread had ordered mitrassof
to take up the pursuit of the horde and to
cut to pieces any clan that refused to return
with him to its residence on the volga

  shortly thereafter the doors of a prison
cell closed on kichinskoi and before the end
ofthat winter he died but mitrassof had
his orders and he carried them out general
traubenberg also was moving across the
volga with a heavy force of infantry an 
artillery but unlike the cossack he took
his time prudently and when he did come

up it was upon the scene of the disaster
at the ukim

  although the horde made the distance
from the volga to the yaik three hundred
and fifty-odd miles in ten days mitrassof
caught up with the rear guard of two clans
on the near side of the yaik

  carrying out his instructions he attacked
the yeka zukor clan when it refused to sur-
render to him and his veteran cavalry swept
over the tatars of that tribe disheartened
the other clan gave up and returned to the
volga

  this defeat caused the horde which had
counted on a week at the yaik to rest the
beasts to move forward again in spite of
the loss of nearly half of their cattle from
overdriving ubaka khan had no means
of knowing how near the main russian
army was to mitrassof

  the cossack colonel was a born leader of
cavalry and he saw his chance to deal a
second blow ubaka was heading for the
torgai more than a weeks march to gain
the river he must cross the mugojar moun-
tains and for the space of some two hun-
dred miles north and south there was only
one suitable pass for a multitude this was
the ukim pass

  mounting picked polish cuirassiers-the
armored ladies of tatar description-on
camels and sending with them his own ad-
vance guard mitrassof gave orders to press
ahead with all available speed to gain the
ukim where a few hundred men could hold
the gorge against as many thousands
drawing reinforcements from a cossack
post on the yaik and patching up his
wounded as he went mitrassof came after
his advance circling the horde

  and then the steppe called a halt snow
set in and a storm kept cossack and tatar
alike in their tents

the storm had driven the torguts
into shelter and billings was work-
ing at the outline of his mapsketch-
ing from a weeks observation he had
stretched a square of scraped leather over a
wooden frame and was laboring under a
single candle when nadesha slipped in
shaking back the drift from her hood

 the yawning man servant who stood
guard over the weapons of norbo and
nadesha blinked as the girl moved into the
fight and studied the parchment over bill-
ings shoulder
the road of the giants



  they are coming to slay you she
observed they say they will rip the skin
from your body and put it upon a tugh

  she turned and gave a quick command
to the tatar who stumbled out of the yurt
wide awake for once billings laid aside
the dividers in his hand and looked from
nadesha to the sword and the brace of
pistols hanging over her corner

  do not think of that my atula she
smiled following his eye the long pistols
will go off twice-pang pang-and then you
might draw your sword the one that you
cherish they would pull down the tent
and drag you out by your feet and trample
you

  who are coming

  a crowd of fools who are beside them-
selves because they have been swallowing
smoke and listening to the talk of loosang
my father is away at the sarga-the council
called by the khan the mob has had no
toil today so they have guzzled kumiss and
their ears are open to evil they want
blood for the blood the cossacks have shed
and loosang has told them you are a spy
the lama has seen you making calcula-
tions with the needle that points always
toward tenni kazyk the polar star

  billings wiped dry the goose quill he was
using as a pen then he covered up his
map since the fighting on the other side
of the yaik he had noticed that the tatars
no longer treated him with indifference
they had grown morose and those who
observed him walking among norbos
henchmen spat and muttered to each other
norbo himself was moodier than usual
men and beasts were hard-pressed the
tatar boys had lashed the cattle and
goaded the oxen to make them keep up
and each day thinned the herds occa-
sionally he had seen bodies twisted and
frozen in the snow the dogs no longer ran
barking beside the wagons they gathered
in packs and fell upon the cattle that could
not keep their legs

  nadeshas eyes half-veiled under long
lashes looked down into billings and her
full under lip thrust out disdainfully

   come my gallant captain are you think-
ing of the thousand men in norbos urdus
and the thousands that are like hungry
wolves as far around you as you could run
in a day and night

  even at night the tatars kept fires burn-
ing at the limits of each urdus and mounted

patrols held the space between the clan
camps the storm might hide him but
he knew that no man would live long afoot
in the icy wind and the snow flurries

  billings picked up his sword from
nedeshas corner tested the blade between
his fingers and smiled

  better this than the storm

  nadesha glared and her tongue had not
been silenced in the least

  dog mud-puppy son of a sow have
i brought you here when you ought to have
had your neck broken with a rope tchul
have i teased that old fool my father until
my jaws cracked just to have you turn
into a- put that blade down or youll
have your breath out of your body

  seeing that her words were unheeded
nadeshas tone changed

  the men who are coming are common
black-boned louts i can handle them until
norbo comes i have sent the servant for
him kai if you do not believe me watch
oh you are stupid

  but no consideration would induce bill-
ings to lay aside the sword he had not
recovered his strength yet the feel of the
hilt in his hand was a tonic a murmur
penetrated the tents the sound of low
voices the clink of steel and the creaking
of leather on wooden saddles horses
seemed to be surrounding the yurt

  billings listened indifferently he heard
the murmuring come close to the wagon
caught voices outside the tent entrance
after all it was good to face these savages
sword in hand and not skulk like a sick
woman behind a tent

  a hand swept aside the flap covering the
entrance a hand upon which jewels shim-
mered in the faint candle-light a puff of
snow sprinkled the floor other hands
ripped open the whole front of the yurt
and billings saw a score of men armed with
spears and swords their faces hidden in
hoods coated white by the storm

  nadesha sprang forward and tossed back
the cape of the leaden an exclamation of
surprize parted her lips as she saw a long
olive face with a trimmed beard and eyes
as dark as her own

  so she cried zebek dortshi chief of
the council and noyon of the red camel clan
of irak calls at the house of norbo with
armed men at his back so while norbo is
at the council you have come by a dogs
trail to his house


 adventure

  the persian tatar motioned her back
billings saw that his outer coat was velvet
embroidered with gold his belt set with
turquoise and sapphires he was a tall
man so that his eyes were on a level with
nadeshas waist

  temou chu dwell in peace maiden
  zebek dortshi pointed at billings

  we have come for that son of a witch
we have no thought of harm for the child
of norbo

  if the noyon was taken aback at seeing
nadesha in the wagon he concealed it but
the girl had not looked to find a noble in the
crowd she knew that zebek dortshi was
in loosangs favor and as head of the coun-
cil was second to the khan in authority
in the horde

  shall i tell norbo that you called for his
prisoner without first asking the will of the
master of the herds he holds this officer
for ransom

  zebek dortshi flushed and nadesha
pressed her attack on his weak point

  does the noyon of the red camel clan
steal like a kurd or has he the command
of - the khan to tear down the tent of
norbo

  i came from loosang spit-fire he
wishes the giaour slain

  oho-and has loosang said aught to
the khan

  she had him but the crowd behind the
noble was growing restive

  that dog is a magician some one
shouted others took up the refrain he
has bewitched our cattle look the
yellow pig has a sword let us cut
him open sister and to the devil with
gabbing about prisoners

  from this zebek dortshi took his cue
he opened his hands and shrugged

  you see nadesha this is not my affair-
the men want the strangers life

  real scorn curled the lip of the girl
these are your men my noyon when
you came wooing me you did not say that
you were their servant

  it is the will of loosang the lama of the
tsong khapa

  a beast in a mask

  nadesha stamped a booted foot and a
growl issued from the throng the priest
came from tibet wore the yellow robe and
the black hat of a chutuktu a disciple of the
dalai lama whose kingdom comprised the
whole of central asia the tatars know-

ing little of religion respected the dalai
lama as a matter of course they had a
whole-hearted dread of the mysteries of the
priests of the long cold mountains

  the time will come the girl protested
hotly when you will know that you have
been sheep following a jackal who wears a
sheepskin ai-a you are stupid sheep

  nadesha caught the gleam in the per-
sians brown eyes and checked her words

  this man is my anda see he wears my
girdle

  throwing open her kaftan she allowed
them to see billings plain leather belt with
the silver clasp wound around her waist

  it is the law among the people of the
tents-two pledged brothers have one life
if you slay the yellow-haired one i will die
with him neither brother abandons the
other

  from the outskirts of the throng a figure
hooded and cloaked pushed forward to a
position close to the wagon tongue the
tatars intent on the astonishing confes-
sion of nadesha did not pay attention to
the newcomer they craned forward each
one anxious to see for himself the two belts

  zebek dortshi ran his fingers through his
soft beard and his eyes narrowed he was
the most far-sighted of the leaders of the
tatars he was ambitious a reckless
leader of horsemen in battle admired for
his wildness by these riders of the steppe

  a match with nadesha had long been in
his mind he coveted the warm fairness
of the maiden she would out of all the
horde be a fitting match for the chief of the
red camel clan she had wit fire she was
no sluggard to be hugged and forgotten

  and now she had named as her pledged
brother a foreigner a christian and impecu-
nious prisoner zebek dortshi knew there
must be a reason for this he thought she
loved the englishman speculatively the
noyon glanced at billings who stood quietly
resting the tip of the rapier on the floor of
the yurt what kind of metal was in this
man

  you are a child nadesha zebek
dortshis brow cleared and a child at
play only between men is the anda tie
knit among the people of the tents

  kai is it so then watch if this be
play

  she drew from her belt a curved dagger
and flourished it in his beard

  among the followers of the noyon there
the road of the giants



was hesitation all knew that norbo would
take immediate and bloody revenge for any
injury to his child they knew likewise
that if they rushed the prisoner nadesha
would probably be severely hurt if not
killed she might even kill herself-there
was no telling what a woman would do

  just then while they muttered and fin-
gered their weapons billings took matters
into his own hands he had had enough
of talk-wrangling that he barely under-
stood

  come he said to zebek dortshi in
broken tatar and taste a sword you
are dogs that bark at a girl and run off from
a weapon

  zebek dortshi decided there was good
metal in the prisoner but the words re-
leased the floodgates of tatar fury men
clambered past the persian thrusting
against one another shouting hoarsely
billings caught nadeshas arm as she would
have hurled herself against the invaders
he whirled her back of him to the floor

  the first man to gain his feet within the
yurt held no weapon as he stepped under
the candle on the tent-pole he threw back
his hood and faced about

  alashan cried zebek dortshi and
shouted to his men to hold off 

  the boys thin face was strained and his
eyes glowed he leaned down to twist
the dagger from nadeshas hand

  i will deal with this man he said pas-
sionately to zebek dortshi call away
these dogs and be gone

  although he was half a head shorter than
the tall noyon his anger made the persian
shrink back a little

  i am the son of ubaka khan he went
on and i will attend to this one whom
nadesha calls anda i will face him fairly
and kill him with my own hand tatars
this is a vow you will see it fulfilled aye
and soon now get to your horses before
norbos men cut your hearts out

  flinging down the dagger he clenched
his fists looking up from face to face as if
marking those who were present zebek
dortshi trembled with fury and was pulled
back by his men who had heard horsemen
who were entering the camp

  norbo-norbo cried the girl it is
nadesha

  as the master of the herds strode forward
alone the men of zebek dortshi gave back
pulling their hoods down as if not eager to

be recognized norbo climbed slowly to
the floor of his yurt and looked about him in
silence

  the khan of the red camels has come
to pay his respects to me said nadesha
quickly with a score of armed men he
came to take the one that is my prisoner
the giaour he entered the yurt and ala-
shan stayed him

  norbos seamed face was emotionless
one of the older tatars of hereditary rank
he had not prospered in russia and the
more versatile khan of irak had been raised
above him

  noyon he observed at last in a rum-
bling voice you have a stick in your hand
it is an unpardonable offense for a guest
to enter the tent of a mongol with a club or
weapon of any kind in his grasp zebek
dortshi was thoroughly angry but he was
discreet chewing at his beard he sheathed
his sword and bent his head very low
mockingly

  take heed o master of the house lest
one day your seat in the council be vacant
as norbo said nothing more the man of
irak beckoned to alashan

  come puppy-they growl at us

  but the boy raised his hand in greeting
to norbo

  may the road be open before you
master of the herds i go

  when the old khan had saluted alashan
the boy left with zebek dortshi without
glancing at nadesha who looked at him
long and curiously as if seeing him for the
first time

   faith muttered billings the old chap
treats me like a scab on the arm and the
boy has promised to kill me but i rather
think they saved my life

       that night they ate heartily for
ejspil norbo announced that ubaka khan
had ordered most of the remaining
sheep and cattle to be slaughtered as the
beasts were dying fast while the snow en-
dured the torguts were to feast against the
beginning of the march nadesha disap-
peared into her corner when the bowls of
cabbage and mutton and of fermented
mares milk were removed leaving norbo
squatting by the fire fingering an empty
pipe

  lying on his back billings studied the
play of shadows on the wall of the tent but
when he started to pull the heavy skins


adventure

  over him as the chill crept in over the floor
  he hesitated finally he rose and offered
  norbo tobacco from the pouch that he had
  cherished

   the ttar grunted sifted the black
 russian tobacco in his gnarled lingers and
 filled his pipe without a word after
 billings had warmed his feet and hands at
 the flames and was returning to his bed the
 khan spoke

   keep that stick in your hand giaour
 and sleep upon it there are dogs about
 you may need to use it

   until then billings had wondered how
 long he would be permitted to retain his
 sword for he knew norbo must have noticed
 that he still had it following the old
 mans advice he thrust the blade in its
 scabbard well down among the skins and
 rolled himself up for the night

    turning over presently on his elbow at a
  sound from the hearth he found that norbo
 had secured the sketch that was the begin-
 ning of his map and had turned it to the
 light the scalp-locked head of the tatar
 was nodding over it

   well he knows good work when be sees
 it thought billings drowsily

    in reality norbo had fallen asleep sitting
 up and was utterly indifferent to the map
 through the closed flap of the yurt there
 came the clang of a brazen basin-the
 gong that marked the hours for the camp
 it was answered by the distant blast of a
 horn norbo raised his head inquiringly
 but the trumpet was that of the lamas

    presently the tatar began to snore with
 a sighing sound like the sucking of the wind
 in and out of the tent from nadeshas
 comer a murmur merged with the note of
 the storm the girl wras crying softly her
 arm pressed against her mouth so that she
 should not arouse the two mpn

throughout the ten days of
feasting while the snow lasted
alashan kept to himself when
clear frosty weather set in he waited im-
patiently until the wind died down and the
drifting of the dunes over the steppe ceased

   the dawn trumpet of the thirteenth day
 filled him with a glow of eagerness he was
 to ride with the advance guard of the horde
 that would make forced marches to the
 ukim pass they would try to gain the
 upper gorge before the cossacks if the cos-
 sacks were there first there would be fight-

 ing anyway this was what alashan
 longed for

  he would show his hardihood in battle
and ubaka khan his father would declare
him a man with all a noyons estate then
and not until then could he challenge bill-
ings the tow-headed christian officer to a
combat with swords the captain alashan
knew would refuse to match weapons with
a boy in imagination when he could not
sleep the son of the khan pictured his
curved sword biting into the stalwart neck
of the stranger

  what tormented him was the favor shown
by nadesha to billings when alashan
thought of her looking at billings and smil-
ing at the quick russian words of the
stranger-words that he did not hear-his
heart pounded and his teeth drew back
from his ups

  so he urged his camel up with the scouts
of his company his father had placed
him with the captain of two hundred musket
men mounted on picked bactrians zebek
dortshi commanded five hundred other
musket men veterans of the war with the
turks and the persian had gone ahead
somewhere to the right of alashans de-
tachment

  behind the two camel corps rode a regi-
ment of mounted infantry followed by the
nucleus of the khans heavy cavalry
these were soon lost to sight in the rear

  outriders informed the tatar captain
that the russians were pressing forward
rapidly from the north

  it is a race for the rocks of the ukim
my young kinglet he confided to alashan
aye the power of the gods of the high
places must aid us if the cossacks and
the armored ladies reach the ukim first they
can hold the gorge until tribes hostile to us
come up the torgai from the south and re-
inforce them from behind aye the mus-
covite regiments are marching after us with
cannon and can join battle within a week if
we do not force the pass

  then we will be the first shouted the
boy come we must ride during this
night

  and kill our camels grumbled the
captain do you want your father the
khan to come up and find us standing like
trees in the snow tchu my foolish bear-
let he would have me flayed alive on a
wooden ass for that i assure you

  nevertheless the tatar set such a pace
the road of the giants

i

that alashan was stiff from exhaustion and
cold by the breaking of the fifth day when
they sighted the heights of the ukim against
the gate of the rising sun

  by then they had lost all touch with
zebek dortshi who seemed to have vanished
into the hollows of the steppe alashan
fretted himself by trying to make his beast
race ahead of the others and a dozen times
he fingered over the priming of the heavy
pistol he had at his belt

  his young eyes were keen and before noon
he made out that mounted men were mov-
ing within the black sides of the gorge he
saw that the ukim pass was like the neck of
a squat bottle only at the summit of the
pass were the sides of the gorge precipitous
along the main slope a wilderness of rock
shot through with outcroppings of pillar-
like basalt stood on either hand amid a
scum of bare tamarisks

  alashans first thought was that zebek
dortshi had beaten him in the race to the
ukim and he gritted his teeth the cav-
alry on the slope below the pass were mount-
ed on camels and seemed to be awaiting
their approach

  the gods are kind he cried suddenly
it was well i made gifts of gold and rus-
sian money to the priest loosang those
are the poles i see the sun on their breast-
pieces and their long lances

 the tatar chewed his mustache and
squinted four-six hundred men in the
pass he reckoned why by the white
horse of kaidu had they not gone higher
where they would have the cliff on either
flank

  their beasts are tired aye some cos-
sacks on horses are with them the cos-
sack cavalry must be close at hand and
these fellows ahead have counted us they
wait on the slope instead of the gorge be-
cause they expect aid before the sun is much
higher

  a murmur of assent from the tatars close
by greeted these words their own mounts
were stumbling and groaning they did not
relish facing the heavy sabers of the cos-
sacks out of the corners of their bleared
eyes they looked at alashan what would
the son of the khan do

  come my brothers of the tents shrilled
alashan we will strike the ranks of our
foes like a thunderbolt they will fall be-
neath our swordstrokes their camels
have gone farther than ours this day-they

barely can stand let us ride them down
instinctively he exhorted his men his
brain was in a whirl never had alashan
ridden into the shock of battle his limbs
quivered and his lips twitched his eyes
were glued on the horsemen above and
ahead of him who sat waiting in ranks like
sitting wolves

  the tatar captain glanced around hoping
to make out some trace of zebek dortshis
command there were no other tracks to
be seen in the snow but his keen eye caught
a light in the weather-hardened faces of his
men fatigue had vanished 

  let us ride after the boy they said
one to another he is a falcon of the
eagles line he is not afraid of the cos-
sacks they are many-we will go from
this spot up into the gate in the sky over
the mountains of natagai where the tengeri
ride on the wind that is good

 only the eyes of the captain were
troubled when the opposing groups halt-
ed at the distance of a bowshot to revile
each other and pick out an opening for attack
alashans blood began to hum in his ears

  if only the thing would begin the sweat
was running down his legs he feared every
moment his camel would bolt or he would
disgrace himself in some way

  his men were shouting guttural chal-
lenges at the splendid-looking poles calling
them hired women and blood-sucking in-
sects and steel-bedizened jezebels the
round-faced poles did not understand but
the cossacks flung back fitting answers

  ho gutter-bred thieves-mud-puppies-
sneaking sons of dogs-turn-coat infidels

who run from a good christian sword-

  crash a burst of musketry from the
russian ranks emptied some of the tatar
mounts and sent the hot blood into alash-
ans burning eyes he did not notice that
the answering volley of his men went wild
for the most part that the tatars followed
their noyon up the slope in scattered forma-
tion while the disciplined poles kept well
together

  he felt his teeth chatter together saw his
companion the old captain shoot an arrow
into the beard of a short cossack only to be
struck from his horse by a back-handed
blow from a huge soldier whose open coat
trailed after him like a cloak as he cast him-
self into the tatars hewing forward and
back and roaring even after arrows stuck
out from his ribs and arms


adventure

   the giant was finally brought down by
 the fall of his pony and sat down in the
 snow with his head bent while his shaking
 hands fumbled for the ikon under his shirt

   the snapping of pistols sounded far off
 alashan came out of his stupor with a jerk
 and was mad with rage on the instant
 tugging at the nose cord of his beast he
 almost ran into a boyish-looking pole who
 cast a lance at him alashan pulled the
 trigger of his pistol and saw the others
 surprized face staring at him out of a cloud
 of smoke

   without waiting to see if the pole fell off
 his camel the son of the khan sprang down
 and secured a more agile mount a riderless
 pony the red mist was still before his
 eyes as he dashed here and there striking
 and parrying

   meanwhile the fight had dissolved into
 group combats in which the tatars were
 outnumbered and cut down rapidly being
 unable to inflict serious damage on the
 armored poles only the natural agility
 of the steppe riders and the deadly use they
 made of their short bows kept up the sem-
 blance of a struggle

   half of them had their wish and went to
 the land of natagai which is in the sky
 behind the flaming gate of the northern
 lights

   alashan halted perforce seeing no foes
 before him he had come through the
 ranks of the russians a louder crackling
 of muskets caused him to stare to either
 side 

  from behind boulders and tamarisk
thickets tatars were firing down on the
russians they were advancing coolly
down the slopes of the gorge on foot kneel-
ing to fire

   alashan blinked and wondered if he were
 dreaming then he made out the brilliant
 figure of zebek dortshi sitting his horse on a
 summit nearby when he shouted orders
 to his lieutenants the noyon took a pipe
 from between his lips presently he raised
 his voice to call to the remnant of alashans
 men bidding them withdraw a short dis-
 tance and form again the red cleared
 from alashans eyes he felt the sweat
 now cold on his limbs another was giving
 orders to his men

   the death of the tatar captain had left
 alashan in command of the camel corps or
 what remained of it he knew zebek
 dortshi must have seen him and yet the

noyon paid no attention to the boy who
was cut off from his own following

  anger quickened alashans pulse and he
wheeled his horse heading back toward his
men he went for them direct on a course
that took him through the scattered groups
of poles and cossacks who had been thrown
into confusion by the fire of the tatars in
their rear

  this uncertainty saved alashan his life
while some russians were turning to try
to gallop up into the safety of the gorge
between the lines of zebek dortshis musket
men others were still facing the tatars be-
low them

  alashan cut off the head of a polish lance
aimed at his ribs and broke his sword in
the mans back as he passed dodging
here and there he edged through the cos-
sacks who would have given more heed to
the unarmed boy if they had known that
here was the son of the khan

  reaching his followers who greeted him
with an exultant shout alashan led them
up the slope again but the fight at the
mouth of the ukim was about over the
camels of the russians were giving out and
stretched themselves groaning on the frozen
earth while their riders were cut down by
zebek dortshis men now mounted again
the cossacks tried to rush the rock nests
and the tamarisk and most of them were
picked off by bullets and arrows

  seeing that only a handful of poles re-
mained standing back to back using their
light lances as spears alashan left these and
rode up to zebek dortshi triumphantly
the persian tatar was still on the summit
looking out over the plain alashan noticed
by the tracks in the snow that the noyon had
brought up his men quietly on foot into
the thickets coming in from either flank
the camels had been herded some distance
in the rear of the rocks until it was time to
mount

  a suspicion came to alashan that the
noyon had been among the thickets for
some time that zebek dortshi had been the
first on the scene arriving from the south
his approach concealed by the foothills of
the ukim

  where were you ahatou-brother
observed zebek dortshi indifferently i
could not see you at first why in the
name of a thousand devils did you try to
ride through the whole muscovite strength
if it had not been for the fire of my men
the road of the giants



you would have been hunted like a hare

    it occurred to alashan if zebek dortshi
  had noticed his feat the noyon must have
  caught sight of him before then if so why
  had not zebek dortshi called to him or
  sent men to protect the son of the khan
  but alashan was too pleased with his first
  battle to wonder about things he had
  reined his horse through four hundred foes
  he had killed his man more than once and
  broken his sword into the bargain

    moreover he was sure blood was mingling
  with the cold sweat on one shoulder and a
  piece had been slashed out of his boot he
  gazed at that boot proudly then he gave
  a cry

    there are men on the plain they are
  fighting

  zebek dortshi looked at him sidewise
  and rubbed the gold-inlaid hilt of his sword

    chu my gamecock did you not see that
  the main force of the cossacks had come
  up below us and the heavy cavalry of the
  khan your father close on their heels

    he considered alashan for a moment

    here take my horse it is a turkoman
  and fresh bear the tidings to your father
  that i hold the gate of the ukim you will
  see more fighting down there-

   waiting for no more alashan was off
 like the wind on a lean pony whose silver-
 inlaid saddle was covered with a fine silk
 cloth in this way did zebek dortshi gain
 credit for giving the son of the khan his
 horse during a battle and the noyon re-
 mained alone in possession of the coveted
 gorge of the ukim

    alashan passed groups of tatars moving
  slowly over the plain binding up their
  wounds and looking at weapons they had
  captured these were the horseraen of uie
  bear clan heavily armed and wearing chain
  mail over their leather tunics their heads
  v were covered with pointed steel caps and
  their black faces were scarred they were
  the heavy cavalry of the horde the pride of
  ubaka khan

   from one of them a commander of a
 hundred who was known to him alashan
 learned that they had come up in time to
 engage mitrassof before the russians could
 reach the shelter of the ukim

    mitrassofs need of haste had brought his
  men up in scattered detachments the
  weight of the polish dragoons had exhaust-
  ed their horses

    they fell like ripe wheat grunted the

tatar the cossacks were a sword of
another edge they were too few you
see some of their bodies here the heads
of others who were late in coming we cut off
back there

  listening alashan heard firing off to his
right to the north edging over that way
he found the lighter regiments of the khan
riding down the fragments of mitrassofs
command more riders were coming up
from the horde constantly

  hai laughed the boy they did not
live long to boast about the yaik

  the battle on the plain was about over
but some distance off he heard the clashing
of weapons a vibrant voice floated out
seemingly from the steppe itself alashan
reined his horse toward the sound he
arrived at the edge of a gully where the
stony dried riverbed vas littered with
corpses several blue tops of cossack hats
were to be seen in the center of a ring of a
mounted tatars who pressed them back
toward the bank of the ravine

  alashan heard the voice again wild and
exultant

           shen shen shivagen

           swing the steel swing again

           ride ride to our play

            slay slay

  shadows gathering in the gully concealed
the outlines of the fighters but alashan
watched the flicker of swords heard the
moans of men who had fallen underfoot
and listened to the deep voice of mitrassof
making mock of his enemies the tatars drew
back at last and some one called for a bow

  mitrassof was alone half-standing half-
lying against the snow on the bank his hat
fallen off his big head lowering on his
shoulders alashan spurred down the slope
of the ravine a bow twanged and after a
moment the tatars rushed in to seize spoil
from the body

  peace dogs cried the boy this
is the starshiln the chief of the cossacks
let him have honor

  unheeding they tore away belt sword
gold-chased scabbard rings and the gold
chain from which hung the ikon alashan
lashed them with words and as they were
moving away one turned back and laid the
chain with its cross on thebody of the cossack

  then the others stopped and presently
all the spoil was returned to the body which
at alashans direction was picked up to be
carried before ubaka khan


adventure

  the khan was not found until his tent
was pitched that night and he rode in dur-
ing a tumult of nakers and trumpets to
throw off his steel cap and sit by the fire
alashan waited until ubaka had inspected
silently the body of his enemy

  after that ubaka called for food and the
boy stood until his father had eased his
hunger the khan had not eaten for two
days alashan was quivering with desire
to pour out his story of the fight at the
gorge he wanted too to point out that
zebek dortshi had been first at the ukim
but had waited until alashan attacked
before entering the battle

  ubaka sat gazing into the fire his knotted
hands resting on his massive knees he
lifted his head and looked at his son

  i-have been to the gorge of the ukim
i have heard the tale of the skirmish
zebek dortshi who is a leader among a
thousand i have rewarded with fox skins
and inlaid daggers with pieces of red leath-
er and saddles sewn with pearls that we took
from the cossack camp he did well
alashans heart sank and he waited for a
word concerning himself ubaka was
pleased with the daring exhibited by the
boy but his hoarse voice was gruff with dis-
pleasure

  my son a soldier can be reckless and as
foolish as a kulan a wild ass but a leader
of men must think wisely when the sword-
strokes begin you are not yet a man
arrived at mans estate

alashan too begaa to study the fire
the time is not when my noyons will
lift their hands to their eyes and say that
you are a true son of the khan-a falcon of
the eagle line i have spoken go

  in the tent of norbo nadesha came to
billings bringing the news of mitrassofs
death and the capture of the ukim with
the words of the girl went the last hope
of rescue for the englishman

  billings thought this over far into the
night and fell to work on his map with new
vigor noting in the location of the ukim

iv

tiie wood ashes that turned into a tree

it was an evening early in spring and
the odor of wet marshland was in the air
when nadesha slipped past the tents of the
wolf clan and made her way toward the one

spot of the camp that was forbidden her
this was the yurt of loosang

  ever since she had been a child-not so
long ago-the girl of norbo had longed to
see inside this solitary wagon tent that was
fashioned of purple cloth instead of the
usual felt or hides and stood on a brightly
painted cart from its depths she often
had watched the lama emerge clad some-
times in yellow sometimes in purple with a
scarlet scarf and the cube-like black hat
that stretched his naturally great stature
to more than the length of two tatar spears
she had listened with awe to the note of the
lamas trumpet that could be heard half
an hours ride away sometimes she fan-
cied the eyes of the priest had dwelt on her

  but this night nadesha planned to gain
entrance to the yurt she would match her
wits against the lamas and try to learn
what the servant of the dalai lama had in
store for the horde for now the torguts
had left behind the part of the steppe known
to them and were nearing the edge of
the unknown spaces where loosang must
guide in a bag she held the last of the
heavy russian money copper and silver
that still remained in their household
now that the ground was soft under foot
at the edge of the high steppe of the kangar
all superfluous weight was being cast from
the loads of the horde

  and loosang had declared that this
money useless now to the tatars was wel-
come in his yurt useful in his ceremonial
he pointed out that by the favor of bon
and the gods of which he was priest the
tatars had overthrown the cossacks at the
ukim and passed the terrible torgai safely
oo a floating bridge of bundles of giant reeds

  on her way to the lamas wagon nadesha
wheedled more copper coins here and there
in the groups that clustered together on the
wet ground

  the yurt of loosang stood alone at the
end of a red clay gully and within fifty
paces of it nadesha was set upon by savage
dogs that ripped her skirt and would have
tasted her blood if a huge voice had not
called them back from the tent

  nadesha advanced laid her bundle on
the wooden platform and kneeled against
the wagon tongue until from the corners of
her eyes she saw that the bundle had dis-
appeared still she waited

  what do you wish daughter of norbo

  i am cold chutuktu and there is a fire
the road of the giants



within i have brought you a great deal of
money

  as she spoke nadesha shivered because
she half-believed the dogs would be set upon
her and the dark gorge was not a pleasant
place

  have you a message from the khan o
your father

 would a noyon send speech by a
woman

  wait then

  it was quite dark before loosang opened
the flap of his tent the girls quick ears
had caught the clink of coins she won-
dered what loosang did with the russian
money he did not carry it along with
him in the wagon which would have been
burdened by the extra weight the ta-
tars were sure of that they believed the
coins disappeared during the ritual of the
lama nadesha wondered

  when she climbed through the opening
she gave an exclamation of surprize a
small fire glowed on some stones with a
reddish hue from it came a sweetish odor
from some dried roots behind the fire sat
what seemed to be a painted statue draped
in a yellow cassock with waistcoat of cloth
of gold and purple apron a high hat
gleamed with lacquer work above a mask-
like face

  nadesha knew that still greater emotion
was expected of her and she pressed her
face to the floor clasping her hands behind
her black coils of hair loosangs eyes
scanned the slender shoulders of the girl
noting her supple arms and the smooth skin
of her neck

  you did not come hither to sit by a fire
he said slowly i have been expecting
you sit by my side and speak when you
are ready

  there were cushions near the lama and
nadesha felt very comfortable her cheeks
had fallen in a little from hunger and her
eyes were overbright she had put on a
chaplet of pearls and a silk coat and washed
her skin in oil and rose water

  if i wished it loosang observed you
would not leave the tent on your feet and
the dogs would soon make of you a thing of
knitted bones two moons ago you went
against my will when you saved the giaour
his life why did you do that

  i am holding the captive for a price

  it must be a big price the day after
zebek dortshi attacked the giaour you sent

your father to ubaka khan norbo asked
the khan to declare to the horde that the
life of your captive must be spared what
is the price

  protection for me

  from whom

  from the gods and especially bon
for some time loosang gazed into the
fire occasionally placing upon it another
root or stick of incense wood when he
spoke his high voice was tinged with sus-
picion

  what makes you seek my protection
daughter of norbo

  nadesha was aware that she was being
studied covertly she cradled her chin in
her hands and pouted mischievously

  kai are not the gods greater than the
khan who is a man

  truly ubaka khan has caused much
suffering among his people seventy thou-
sand souls have gone out like candles in the
wind since the march began in each
family one lies sick the wolves and the
vultures follow the trail of the horde
many more will die

  of course nadesha nodded confi-
dentially

  food and fodder are at an end the
clans hunt and pillage as they can the
men of the khans own cavalry are mur-
muring loosang knew that nadesha
was shrewd he had watched the girl and
found her to his liking so you think the
day will soon be at hand when you must
seek aid of the gods

  aye the girl answered the day will
come within this moon that is now new
then the horde will cross the kangar des-
ert at the end of the desert they will turn
to you to lead the way whither

  loosang felt a sting of suspicion but
the girl at his side was open-eyed and her
brow was without guile still he answered
craftily	

  whatever will happen is the will of the
gods for nine days i shall sleep and my
dreams will search out the far places of the
spirit world so that i may know what is
ordained loosang thought for a mo-
ment if the giaour is not given into my
hands by ubaka khan at the end of the
sleep evil will come against the horde
aye for one thing- his hand caught the
girls wrist-alashan will be slain by your
prisoner

  nadesha tossed her head


adventure

  my thoughts are not for the son of the
khan

  nor for the lion-haired giaour

  here nadesha took refuge in a smile
instead of finding out things from the lama
the secrets of her heart were being probed
when the persian tatar smiled it warmed
the blood of men for her lips were a lure
true my lama

  no more but the smile and the words
kindled the imagination of the priest

  nor do you love the persian khan
zebek dortshi daughter of norbo

  again most true though zebek
dortshi will fly higher and faster than
alashan a noon ago at the ukim the
noyon schemed so cleverly that the son of
the khan was within a swords edge of being
slain is it not so

  suspicion having passed from the mind of
loosang he did not deny this nadesha
half-caught her breath for alashan had told
her about the act of zebek dortshi at the
gorge and her wit had penetrated its motive

  it is you little dove he whispered al-
most to himself who will look down upon a
kingdom at your feet and your petal-fingers
shall play with jewels

  his long hand went out and touched
nadeshas forehead it was as if a snake
had crawled across her face but she did not
move only when the hand crept down to
her throat and lingered on the vein of blood
that was like a pulse she spoke

  i could love one greater than the giaour
at the end of this moon i will deliver my
prisoner to you

  tahil-tebihou-the bargain is struck
then where is my kingdom
throwing back her head the girl laughed
softly at the surprize of the priest

  to play on the fancy of nadesha loosang
described to her the temple of b on that
stood at the edge of the kangar upon a
wide river that flowed down from the
mountains of tibet-the house of bon
where the face of the great god peered out
from the cliff itself and monks both men
and women passed their lives at the palace
of the god

  they who gave up their souls to bon the
destroyer of earthly things would taste
paradise in the place of their worship
were paintings as old as the memory of
man the floors were jade covered with
silken rugs from bokhara the masters of
the monks were warriors who wore gold and

scarlet and carried standards as tall as the
trees jewels were in their saddles for
they were servants of the dalai lama who
was the living buddha reborn during three
times three thousand years

  and the master of the lamasery-

	i am chutuktu abbot of that lamasery
which is at sonkor on the edge of the kan-
gar and i have been lama of the black
kirghiz the greatest of the tatar tribes of
asia

  so spoke loosang his breath warm
against the hair of the girl he had the gift
of making others see clearly what he painted
with words

   when i ride back to sonkor the sakyas
will carry candles before me on the terraces
a chutuktu is a prince for the dalai lama
is a king  i shall go back- just for a sec-
ond he hesitated-when my work here is
done

  this time it was nadesha who leaned
forward to feed the fire a startling
thought had come to her and she wished to
hide her face if the lama should guess
what was in her mind she would not see the
light of the next sunrise nor would the
master of the herds know what fate had
befallen his daughter for nadesha had
come secretly to the yurt of loosang

  even as she bent down she was seized
in an iron grasp and pulled back so that she
lay across the knees of the priest the
face of loosang had changed as if he had
put on one of his masks his small eyes
burned

   but it was passion and not suspicion that
 had stung him to seize the girl so nadesha
 saw in a flash yet his touch upon her
 neck and shoulder brought the color
 flooding into her cheeks she twisted in his
 grasp whipping out a knife from her khalat

  before loosang could move she had
placed the point of the curved dagger
against his throat and pressed it in a little
the lama snarled angrily as his head per-
force bent back then the knife was
withdrawn and he saw nadesha sitting
beside him quietly the dagger secreted
again

   you are a fool and a child he ejacu-
lated the harsh tibetan accent creeping
into his words no one has drawn steel
against me who can not be hurt by steel

   the girl reflected that he seemed unwill-
 ing to put the matter to a test

  no one has laid hand on me before
phe road of the giants



 this she responded calmly now it is in
 my mind that you lied to me about the
 kingdom of sonkor where the kirghiz
 are-

lied i loosang for the first time
was answering blindly the thrusts of the
tatar he laughed shrilly nay your
own eyes will see it i will take you there
that is part of the bargain

  good it shall be done and sooner than
you think

  for his part the lama had tasted a little
of the beauty of nadesha now he meant
to possess her in this he could be patient
as for nadesha she had had a vision of a
great doom preparing for the clans for the
wolf clan and her father and the khan it
was no more than a vision as yet a mingling
of the power of loosang the power of the
black kirghiz and the wiles of zebek
dortshi she felt as if she stood at the
edge of a pit that was being dug

  but there was nothing that she could say
to norbo there was only one thing to do-
to be taken to sonkor and there to learn
what truth was in her fears so to this
end she prepared to play her part she
even thought of the curious disappearance
of the money that had been brought to
loosang

  her own bag was visible in a corner of
the yurt but the store of coins that had
passed into the hands of the lama was not
to be seen evidently he had disposed of
them in some way

  leanwhile the lama had bent his head to
one side as if listening

  i hear the voices of the council the sarga
of the torguts that is assembled in the
tents of ubaka khan he said they
are cattle those ancient ones of the horde
who bend the head to natagai

  true assented nadesha wondering
what he was leading up to

 she had known the council was in session
to debate a message received from general
traubenberg who was pursuing the horde
the russian offered pardon to all clans that
would turn back with him to the volga
so this night the issue must be decided
whether to press on to the hi or retrace their
steps to the volga

  seeing the hunger written in the thin
cheeks of the girl loosang handed her a
bowl of sweetmeats

  the khan is still as great as the lama
observed he dryly he is a yak but the

herd follows its leader so-i hear his
words

   my brothers of the tents we are knit
together as flesh with bone where one
clan goes all must ride or we shall be
dust before the wind who would be a
slave  

  loosang mimicked the slow heavy tones
of the khan and threw his voice so that it
seemed to come from the tent top the
girl ceased eating and waited anxiously

  ubaka is saying that at the end of the
road ahead lies the valley of the ili where
are the graves of their fathers there the
gate in the sky can be seen and the souls of
the old torguts may look down upon them

  and what is the will of the council
asked nadesha nibbling again at a date

  wait and you will hear with your own
ears

  loosang motioned her back into the shad-
ows behind him nadesha heard a small
bell tinkle over her head several times
soon came a footfall outside and a voice
familiar to her

  norbo master of the herds is here to
speak with the chutuktu the sarga seeks
the wisdom of the priest

  it occured to her for the first time that
loosang had a watcher posted outside the
tent in the shadow of the side of the gorge
and that this man warned loosang by ring-
ing the bell of the approach of others she
smiled at the way her father clipped his
words norbo had no love for loosang
who opposed the old traditions of the tatars
cherished during the long stay in russia

  loosang the priest made a sign for nad-
esha to remain quiet where she could not
be seen

  norbo sat just within the yurt entrance
facing the fire

  ubaka our khan began norbo blunt-
ly has spoken in council he says rightly
that we should seek the skies of our old
home so does zebek dortshi say but
many of the noyons are wavering so the
vote was to send for your word

  plainly the old chief did not relish his
mission the lines in his leathern face were
deep as he scowled at loosang through the
heavy smoke

  as loosang kept silence norbo repeated
surlily

  to press on or turn our horses heads
what is your word for my part i follow
ubaka to the ili with my clan


adventure

  the hand of the priest scattered more
roots thickly in the fire

  look he croaked suddenly

  the glow of the flames died and a swirl of
gray smoke swept up out of the smoke a
stunted tree took form nadesha could
even see branches in the semi darkness

  she caught her breath and looked again
the tree was standing there upright in the
coils of smoke then a flicker of fire crept
up blazed and the likeness of the tree was
gone

  norbo glanced up at the ceiling then at
loosang and bit his mustache

  go ordered the priest say to the
council you have seen an omen

  what means the omen chutuktu
this out of fire and smoke will grow
up the rooftree of the torguts the clans
must go to their own land i will show
them the way

  norbos shrewd eyes snapped

  ai-a that was the word of the mighty
genghis it is a good word

  when he was gone loosang rose and
stretched chuckling to himself

  you have heard my little owlet the
lion asks counsel of the leopard the lion
thought he was strong and swift but the
steppe is wide oh the steppe has a voice
and a lure it is like a fair woman men
give their lives up to it now the lion
limps for he is lame-lame

  while speaking he walked slowly to the
side of the hearth by the open flap tossing
upon the embers some brown powder he
had taken from his robe again a thick
smoke came up to the tent top where there
was not the customary air vent nadesha
choked

  suddenly she sprang up with a cry the
fumes were strangling her she started to
run past the fire holding her sleeve against
her mouth but loosang thrust the girl
back wavering she sank down to the
floor her eyes closed her lungs laboring
the lama standing in the fresher air
coughed and presently stepped outside
drawing shut the flap behind him

  still muttering to himself he hastened to
the gully behind the yurt where his two
disciples had been busied during the greater
part of the evening they had built up a
shrine of stones in which were stuck sticks
bearing shreds of rags it was customary
with loosang to maic in this fashion the
places where his yurt had stood

  now when he came to the pile of rocks
the lama placed therein the bag of money
nadesha had given him and watched while
the two men covered it up with more stones

  for him who travels in the desert he
laughed quietly a landmark

v

loosang sleeps

rain was falling thinly -as the master
of the herds rode to find the quarters
of his clan the sky wras broken-a cloudy
dawn

  norbos powerful arms swung against his
hips dried blood had stiffened one side of
him where shoulder and hip had been cut
open by an enemys sword he had not
eaten for two nights and a day but tied
to the peak of his wooden saddle was a hind
quarter of an antelope given to norbo by a
hunting party that he had met coming in
from the marshes

  the old chieftain rode with his head
raised he was looking for the fires in the
sky that he had heard were to be seen
above the valley of the ili

  very tired was norbo and he felt he
would like to ride up into the gate where
the souls of the elder heroes would come to
meet him and all would have horses meat
and drink he had been near to the gate
that night for the baskir tribesmen had
attacked the rear of the horde in force

  picking its way among huddles of soaked
men and women who lay sometimes half-
submerged in water the pony by instinct
sought out its own clan norbo remem-
bered a dawn last winter when he had
passed by such silent groups among them
the body of his sister the tatars had
frozen when fuel for the fires had given out

 by the mane of my grandsire he
growled under his breath there is one who
lies at ease

  his eye had lighted on the yurt of loo-
sang nearly all of the torguts wagons
had fallen to pieces or been broken up for
firewood loosangs was intact the lama
had given out word that he was about to
sleep in a trance for nine days during-
the nine days no one wras to come within a
spears cast of his yurt

  two disciples of the lama armed kept
watch by the carved and painted wagon

    the northern lights
the road of the giants



norbo saw that a flag of yellow silk flapped
above the wagon shaft it was a prayer
flag and it had been hoisted when loosang
went into the trance

  his own yurt together with that of the
khan having been split up to be made into
fresh spear hafts norbos camp consisted
oftly of a felt tent before which a half-dozen
ponies stood obediently he dismounted
stiffly and splashed through a puddle to
peer into the entrance

  nadesha he summoned i have meat
cook it the clan must go forward within
an hour

  instead of the girl billings crawled out of
the tent his cheeks were pinched but
shaven clear after drinking from a bowl
that had stood outside during the night he
offered it to the noyon without result and
then emptied it over his head

  nadesha has not been here for a day
and a night uncle he drawled

  then after shaking the water from his
hair and rubbing it from his eyes he set to
work with flint steel and a pinch of powder
to ignite some dry leaves and twigs he had
kept dry in his blanket

  this done the two men gave all their at-
tention to nourishing the flame first with
broken pine branches gathered during the
last days march against the possibility of
food to be cooked and then with damp birch
sticks culled from a near-by thicket

  as the crackling grew the smoke thick-
ened and the odor of sizzling meat spread in
the air men came to stand and look at the
two norbo who was gulping down his
portion half-scorched motioned them to
come and partake of the meat

  a plague on these savages muttered
billings cutting himself off a piece and
roasting it on his long knife raw or sea-
soned tis all the same to them and as for
salt-

  with a sigh he contemplated his ragged
garments neatly sewn in a dozen places
and glanced over the plain of high grass
muddy and treacherous as a bog

  who among you has seen nadesha the
last day and night

  their faces black with exposure to the
sun smoke and grime were expressionless
they had not seen the girl her pony
though was missing from norbos herd

  she chose her horse yet took no weap-
ons norbo grunted frowning

  by noon he had no word of nadesha it

was strange that the girl could have gone
off from the clan in the center of the horde
without being seen billings too was
thoughtful he remembered that nadesha
had when he last saw her warned him to
keep near to norbo until this moon should
be at an end a blare of powerful horns
caused him to glance up the yurt of
loosang was approaching rolling over the
uneven ground escorted by the two young
priests both armed the yellow flag
snapped and fluttered

  billings watched it pass and kept his
horse standing after norbos cavalcade had
passed on he was allowed to do pretty
much as he chose in these days of mutual
suffering riding alone billings had es-
pied alashan

  dwell in peace brother he smiled as
the boy came up i have a word for
you

  alashan glanced at him coldly but
reined in and the two rode on in silence after
the joggling cart

  nadesha observed billings has van-
ished she is no longer in the horde
and you the boy gritted his teeth

  i am her anda you are her betrothed
good this is a dark matter i smell
treachery and so i would speak to you as
her brother

  alashan became grave

  you speak fairly do not forget that i
have sworn to lift my sword against yours
until one of us dies

  meanwhile nadesha the daughter
of norbo has been to talk with loosang
not once but several times now she is
gone and the lama is not to be seen no
other tatar i think would harm nadesha
that is my word

  what says norbo

  naught but he is troubled

  then i will have speech with these
snakes and learn what evil loosang has
put upon nadesha

  when alashan spurred up to the sacred
yurt billings was close behind as the boy
came within a spears throw of the wagon
cne of the disciples wheeled his horse

  back tatar away from the dwelling
place of the lama whose spirit is with the
living buddha in the sacred city

  alashan however kept on and his pony
being the heavier the gylong the young
novice staggered aside his loose lips shed-
ding a venomous flood of curses a second


adventure

disciple portly and uncomfortable in the
rain faced alashan from under the shelter
of a purple canopy held by two servants

  rascal unsanctified he bawled taking
care that his voice should carry to groups of
herdsmen who had halted to watch the
scene from a distance ubaka khan will
set thee on a stake for this-

  recognizing alashan the novice blinked
and his fat cheeks twitched

  is loosang within demanded the boy
calmly

  the chutuktus body lies in the tent in
sonkor where he was abbot-

  stand aside i would speak with the
lama

  such presumption made the pseudo-
priest gape his eyes grew round all at
once his stout body quivered snatching
the umbrella from his attendant he struck
at the boy who took the blow on his arm and
reached out with his other hand it closed
on the crystal rosary the other wore and
he twisted it tight with no gentle touch
the mouth of the gylong opened wider and
his eyes bulged

  harken hissed the boy keep silence
if you would not wear a noose instead of a
rosary

  with a parting twist alashan released the
gylong but the man was too startled to be
reasoned with as the boy jumped from
his saddle to the wooden steps leading up
to the front of the wagon the fat fellow be-
gan to bawl again sounding indeed very
much like a cow

  as the son of the khan raised the covering
over the entrance billings saw the other
gylong slip up the steps the disciple had
drawn a knife from the wide sleeve of a
cassock billings had anticipated amuse-
ment but matters were growing serious
he reined his horse up to the platform and
caught the wrist of the gylong a heave of
the shoulders and the man was jerked back
to fall into a mud puddle

  meanwhile the yelling of the fat disciple
had brought the watching tatars nearer
a glance showed billings that they were
from a clan unknown-to him and even in his
rage the gylong had been careful not to men-
tion the name of the son of the khan

  the behavior of the two convinced bill-
ings that alashan had stirred up a hornets
nest drawing his sword he swung from
the saddle to the platform shoving off the
frightened servant who had been holding

the reins alashan had disappeared within
the yurt and billings was wondering what
the boy had seen but by now the herds-
men convinced that something was very
wrong were beginning to run toward him
they shouted brandishing knives and pikes

  not so long ago billings had encountered
such a mob he realized that alashan had
gone too far with the fat priest crying
them on the tatars would probably beat
him to a pulp before they listened to any
words from the boy

  gathering up the reins in the hand that
held his sword he plied the whip that had
been resting against the tent loosangs
horses were well fed and there were six-
of them they lurched forward into the
traces before the wagon could gain head-
way a pair of lean herdsmen leaped to the
steps and lifted their pikes billings
dropped the reins and was about to thrust
with his sword when he saw the two hesi-
tate and lower their weapons

  the wolf of nadesha one of them
cried

  they were looking at his belt but
billings did not wish to be taken in hand
belt or no belt he shouted to the herds-
men to give back and lashed out again with
his whip the horses broke into a trot and
then to a jerky gallop the two invaders
dropped off

  others spurred on by the gylong who
urged his horse frantically after the wagon
were running behind the yurt a clamor
of angry yells rose above the creaking of the
axles and clattering of the wooden floor
the yellow flag whipped in the wind the
streamers snapped out from the eaves of the
purple tent dogs barked	v

  grinning billings plied the whip it
occurred to him that loosang might emerge
from within and he kept a wary eye over his
shoulder whilehe guided his imposing
chariot along the muddy plain he could
make out two ample piles of skins the beds
of the disciples also a wine cask and an
array of foodstuffs all jolting about a
bell was ringing violently

  the tent bellied like a sail and the front
portions were torn loose from the floor pegs
from this aperture alashan peered

  by the mane of the white horse of kaidu
what has happened

  taking in the - situation he smiled and
beckoned billings as they had outdis-
tanced the pursuers the map-maker brought
the road of the giants

i

his steeds down to a trot and tied the reins
to a carved image of the sitting buddha

  behind a curtain stretched midway across
the tent he saw a figure lying on a couch
it was clad in all loosangs finery under
the high lacquered hat was the head of a
panther

  as billings looked the eyes rolled in the
head toward him and the jaw of the beast
opened a little overhead the bell began
to toll again as the wagon crossed some
rough ground the flesh on billings back
grew cold in the strong odor of the tent
there was a smell of something unclean

  look said alashan around the
ridgepole were arranged other heads some
of familiar animals some of ghastly and
obscene shapes

  a mask muttered billings what is
beneath

  nothing weights hung under them
move these eyes of painted mica the
jawbone is loose it is an effigy

  to frighten those who might look in
while loosang is away

  aye but here is no sign of nadesha
abruptly the wagon slowed lurched and
was still tilted to one side they were
ditched looking out billings saw his
pony and alashans horse a spears
cast away was norbo with his two servants
and the pack animals

  alashan walked to the horse of the
master of the herds and billings followed
while the tatars stared in puzzled surprize
luckily they were among a nest of dense
thickets and no others were in view at the
moment but billings knew that the mad
flight of the sacred wagon across the plain
had been seen by many and that presently
the fat gylong would catch up with them

  my lord the boy saluted the chief-
tain respectfully it is a lie that loosangs
body rests here while his spirit is abroad
here is only a mask and garments loo-
sang has gone from the horde nadesha
is not to be found she has spoken with
him he is a master of evil to my mind i
have read in his eyes that he lusts after her
unexpectedly the old woman servant
spoke up seizing the stirrup of the noble
her master

   my lord chief of the ulus it is said in the
tents that the shape of the lama was seen
on the night before last riding like a demon
as tall as a tree and attended by his familiar
in the form of a woman

  whither did they turn the heads of their
horses asked alashan

  who knows my young lord up into
the stars where the tengeri leap from moun-
tain to mountain or down into the earth

where-

  alashan broke in billings the fat
priest called loosang abbot of sonkor
is that truth

  aye assented the boy he comes from
the lamasery that is nearest the steppe
do you know where it lies

  the boy shook his head whereupon bill-
ings showed him a strip of yellow paper he
had taken from the wallet in his coat-the
map of the armenian showing the caravan
route from constantinople to tashkent
it was inaccurate and wildly picturesque as
to distances in the northeast comer was
 picture of a tower and the legend son-
kur a mountain was drawn close by

  it is in the air and in the water and the
sand muttered the old woman so the
kara kirghiz say-the black kirghiz
tribesmen

  with his swords point billings traced an
equilateral triangle in the mud then he
glanced at the sun reflecting dimly from the
gray haze with a last look at his map he
replaced it carefully in his coat and thought
for a moment

  sonkor lies in that quarter-he pointed
with his sword -two days and one nights
hard riding

  every one except norbo drew back hasti-
ly from the triangle in the mud and all
surveyed billings expectantly this was
surely magic billings with the knowledge
that the gylongs would arrive very soon in
the thicket had done some rapid thinking

  the map-unreliable as to distances-
told him that the temple of sonkor lay near
mountains at the edge of the river chu
which flowed from the mountains of tibet far
to the southeast so the old woman had
proclaimed-near the heights the sand and
the water

  a single rider moves more swiftly than
an army -loosang would have left the
horde before they reached the point nearest
to sonkor at the end of nine days he must
be back again so he could not give more
than four days to each half of his journey
because even a tatar jigit would need
some hours rest and a change of horses at
sonkor admitting that loosang was trav-
elling over the lower sides of his equilateral


adventure

triangle and the horde had journeyed
along the northern side for a day and a
half it was easy to see that sonkor lay
about two days and some hours and to the
south by south east

  billings was sure of this when he ob-
served that the route he had figured for
loosang and nadesha skirted the edge of
the kangar no one would willingly cross
the kangar

  that will lead me through the desert
reflected alashan

  will you follow loosang

  aye alashan turned to his horse
then norbo spoke for the first time
you have not asked permission of your
father the khan to leave the horde
nadesha was greatly loved of norbo
all three knew that if she had gone with
loosang to the place of the lamas it would
be only by the rarest of good fortune that
she would regain the horde loosang if he
desired the girl would not bring her back to
the protection of her father and ubaka khan

  yet the master of the herds who could
not leave his post reminded alashan that
he was the son of the khan and might not
leave the horde unbidden

  peace be with you uncle said alashan
moodily let zebek dortshi and the
others say that i have left the clan during
suffering and hunger tell them so your-
self if you will

  he flung himself into the saddle

  give me goatskins for water and an-
other horse norbo give them to me i
shall follow nadeshas trail until i find her
his dark cheeks flushed by the white
horse of natagai my father will not call me
a man i go my own road

  the cracks in norbos worn face deepened
and he pulled at his gray mustache bill-
ings who had secured his own pony now
mounted and spoke before the master of
the herds

  alashan-he listened for the splash of
approaching hoofs-i have told you one
true word and i have shown you where
sonkor lies i can lead you to the temple
with my maps i will go with you

  the boys eyes were hostile

  nay i will find nadesha without aid
from you

perhaps but two swords are better than
one you are betrothed to nadesha i am
her brother we are together in this thing
kai be it so norbo nodded the

son of the khan must not go without a man
to protect his back better a hundred men

of my clan-

 not so barked alashan they
would take the word to my father at once
and i would be bound and beaten he
looked long at billings if you are my
companion in this thing you are none the
less my enemy when it is over-if we both
five is that agreed

  under his mustache billings smiled

  kai-be it so

  there was no time for more the man
servant who had been watching from the
thicket reported the approach of riders
led by the priests norbo quickly thrust
the reins of his own horse into alashans
hand and gave the remaining riding pony
to billings

  come back to the horde he growled
at alashan or i am dishonored to
billings he added coldly-

  protect the prince

  as they put spurs to their horses drawing
the two spare mounts with them billings
was still smiling here was a chance
at liberty with a horse-two horses and
a weapon-he could reach sonkor and by
the aid of his maps work south to tash-
kent where in time he could find a caravan
going west to samarkand and the caspian

  in time it could be done he had prom-
ised to complete the map for nadesha only
so long as he should be with the horde
plyiiig whip and spur the thicket was soon
left behind and they merged among the
groups of tired riders who half-asleep
splashed through the mud

  behind them two furious gylongs righted
the sacred wagon and searched fruitlessly
the myriad tracks around the thicket
they shot questions and threats at norbo
in the same breath but the old tatar had
retired into his habitual silence

  when the priests rode off he began to
walk through the marsh with the ungainly
gait of one whose stiff limbs are better
schooled to the belly of a horse followed
by the two servants and the pack-animals
he trudged along his eyes raised from
habit to the gray expanse of sky in the east

jjssss but not in two days and one night
mtow or in twenty days could captain
billings have found the temple of
sonkor whither loosang had gone with
nadesha before the sun had gone down
the road of the giants



for the first time he had lost his direction
and a cloudy night concealed the stars

  they kept the wind the hot wind that
had sprung up during the day at their backs
they rode in silence billings in the lead
progress was slow-deep sandy dunes to
be met with for the most part and serried
clay gullies that turned them aside con-
stantly

  billings fancied that they were ascending
his ears strained for a sound but the dark-
ness was like a heated curtain the croak-
ing of frogs the trilling of birds-all this
had been left behind them with the marsh-
land nor was there any moisture in the
air the steppe of the kangar the hunger
steppe was a blind labyrinth of dunes and
gullies

  halt and unsaddle the horses ordered
alashan when the night was about half
done and the air was becoming a little chill
eat and sleep

  surprized billings reined in the boy
was already working at the saddle girths
and made no response to billings questions
when the maker of maps climbed down
alashan spoke curtly

  we are wandering first on one hand
then the other i have been watching that
rock for an hour

  he pointed behind them but only after
straining his eyes a long time did billings
make out a bulk that was darker than the
sky and the sand an outcropping of basalt
or sandstone shaped like a pillar

  you are merely keeping your back to
the wind pointed out the tatar angrily
the wind changes

  billings heard the boys jaws crunch on
a portion of the dried meat he had carried
between saddle and saddle cloth to keep
it warm and soft enough to eat

  nay-your map was a picture this is
a desert how will you find the right di-
rection in the morning

  billings was engaged with his scanty
rations of decaying cheese and tough meat
they had been able to buy some provisions
from another clan and had filled their
goatskins at a pool before leaving the horde

  the map-maker was accustomed to lay
a stick of wood along the course to be fol-
lowed the next day when he made camp
but now he was aware that alashan was
right he had been wandering from the true
direction and one quarter was like another
moreover there had been no time at their

  departure to retrieve the compass from the
packs containing his instruments

  the sun will show us the way alashan

  and if there be no sun

  then we will see

  morning dawned gray and cloudy the
wind had failed the horses had found a
scrub thicket of tamarisk and were feeding
there near a stagnant pool of yellow water
when billings would have filled a half-
empty goatskin here alashan pulled him
back

 that is death come it is time-
time

  they mounted billings stiffly alashan
with a spring the boy glanced over his
shoulder

  which way

  surveying the sea of dunes billings noted
the position of the purple finger of basalt
away from this he turned his horses head
and alashan followed without comment
the boy rode like one possessed pointing
out the strips of clay that offered firmer
footing than the sand on the tops of the
ridges he changed from horse to horse
without halting

  at first billings glanced at the boy
expecting him to halt to eat but alashan
pulled some of the dried meat from under
a saddle and went on

  billings removed his tattered coat and
tied it behind his saddle and then his
waistcoat followed suit he felt little
relief then he tried chewing some of
the meat but that increased his thirst
presently alashan pulled down into the
soft bottom of a gully a line of tracks
were visible

  two camels with riders muttered
alashan

  he took the lead following the tracks
they led slightly across the course billings
had been on before long other traces
joined the camel tracks alashan studied
them dismounting in order to see the
better

  what can you say of this my giaour
captain

  utilizing the pause to fill his pipe bill-
ings shook his head good-humoredly

  nothing except that they be horses

  horses of the black kirghiz they
are shod with yaks hide fastened by wood-
en plugs that leave traces in the sand

  hm said billings

  he had heard nadesha say that the kara


adventure

kirghiz were mountaineers the most pow-
erful tribe of central asia also they were
occasionally in league with the baskirs from
the steppe the most bitter foes of the torguts

  alashans green eyes were triumphant
at the knowledge that he had divested the
older man of leadership not billings
fault for the maker of maps had been un-
able to bring his compass and the sky had
been clouded

  there isanother trail he exclaimed
pointing ahead

  this proved to be other horses again two
before an hour had passed a fourth trail
turned into the main track billings re-
flected and turned to the boy

  the kara kirghiz live in the hills to the
south and east the hindu kush four
pairs or at least three are riding swiftly
back through the desert do you see the
meaning in that

  for answer alashans lip curled it
meant that each man of the black kirghiz
had a spare horse-and so was equipped
for fast travel it meant too that four
riders outside their ovn lands were meeting
at a rendezvous in the heart of the kangar

  the black kirghiz are dogs and thieves
they have sent men to spy on the horde
they are returning with news of what they
have seen

  kai-it is so billings nodded but
what was their meeting place in this pur-
gatory of god

  the boy was indifferent nor did he
take the precaution of riding below the
ridges they had been following billings
however was interested in the question
of a landmark how could four riders
have met-or at least turned into a common
path-within six miles he studied the
horizon and presently touched alashans
leg with his stirrup

  ahead of them was smoke rising from a
clump of dead trees alashan declared
that tents were visible in the thickets under
the gnarled willows

  he would have gone ahead into the en-
campment thinking only of finding his way
at once to sonkor and nadesha but billings
persuaded him to circle the spot keeping
behind the sand ridges

  if they watch it would be toward the
north he ejxplained and the boy reluc-
tantly consented

  they found the place to be a village some
wretched shepherds huts and a herds-

mans tent by a pool of muddy water
the peasants were away in the willow
clumps along the dried river bed in which
the pool stood the women and children
ran and hid at their approach

  but on a bench outside a clay hut ala-
shan found a baskir man dead drunk
a dromedary knelt by the desert rider and
under his sprawling feet was a sack of
varied spoil	

  the baskir fell in with the mountain
men by chance observed alashan they
gave him a skinful of drink to loosen his
tongue and find out what he knew then
they rode away to the south as thevtraces
show in haste-because they did not lift
his plunder we will do so

  he sorted over the contents of the bag
and found a soiled cossack svitza or woolen
coat together with a fine red sash and green
silk neckcloth rummaging further he
drew out a greasy lambskin cap these
things he gave to billings

  when we are outside the village you
must put them on my comrade he pointed
out the baskir son of a dog has been
robbing the dead in the path of the horde

  he stared moodily at the snoring raider
and proceeded to strip him of khalat panta-
loons leather leg wraps and turban when
it was too dark to follow the tracks of the
kirghiz they halted and gathered some of
the dried tamarisk branches for a fire
lighting it in a deep hollow screened by
bushes while the flame was bright ala-
shan trimmed billings beard with his knife
and shaved off the long hair back of the
forehead then the maker of maps
stripped to his shirt and boots and pulled
on the rough nankeen breeches the silk
sash and the heavy svitza

  the garments were rich in material and
though slashed and stained were nearly
new billings wrapped the green cloth
about his neck and thrust the hat on the
back of his head as he had seen mitrassof
do he had the erect carriage of a soldier
and so the cossack garments did not look
amiss on him moreover the sun had
burned his skin to the hue of leather

  meanwhile alashan had done likewise
with the baskirs outfit screening his long
black hair with the loose folds of the tur-
ban that came down to his shoulders the
boys chin was lean his nose thin and down-
curved so that he fitted into the part of
a desert man
the road of the giants



  alashan looked up and hiseyes narrowed
he had not known billings would be so
striking a figure in cossack dress a real
gallant he told himself and his eye fell
on the belt with the wolfs head that bill-
ings had cast carelessly into the sand
would you part with that he cried
with what billings glanced down and
whistled reflectively

  if they were to go into loosngs temple
-and he had given up hope of overtaking
the lama before then-he could not well
wear the emblem of a tatar clan alashan
himself had suggested the disguises as
necessary when he saw that the kara kir-
ghiz were afoot

  look here alashan he suggested
why dont you keep the thing under your
girdle nadesha is your girl

  the boy flushed angrily he would not 
receive a gift from billings the map-
maker could never understand the boys
nature nevertheless he did not bury
the wolfs head in the sand with his other
worn-out garments but left it lying by the
fire in the morning he saw that it was
gone and judged that alashan had it about
him

  as they were lying down on their saddle
cloths to sleep billings turned to the boy

  do you think nadesha went with loo-
sang of her own will

  silence billings felt that he had said
something harmful

  alashan it looks as if the kirghiz
whoever they are were gathe ing around
sonkor what does that mean

  it was so long before the son of the khan
answered that billings lay back and was
settling his shoulders in the sand when a
jackal snarled from beyond the hollow

  the wild dogs are sitting on their
haunches said alashan in a low voice
the jackals have come from afar the vul-
tures are in the air
here

  nay around lhe horde

  billings as he pictured the road-weary
clans crossing the desert steppe a hundred
and fifty miles in three days thought this
was more than likely

sonkor would not have been
found by billings alone for the
reason that it was hidden from any
searcher who should come over the steppe
alone the captain might have combed the

plateau for months and seen only the oc-
casional aul of a shepherd or the basalt
shafts that might have been tombstones

of giants

  but alashan followed the kirghiz tracks
with the nose of a ferret until hostile tribes-
men appearing ahead of them on the trail
forced them to turn aside then it was
billings who used an old trick of the ex-
plorers and ascended a height from which
the ground in front of them could be sur-
veyed as clearly as if drawn on a map

  by jove he said

   even alashan drew in his breath quickly
the red clay sloped away sharply in front
evidently to the edge of a precipice be-
yond and below this was a great green
valley topped on the farther side by moun-
tains of immense extent in the center of
the valley they could see a sluggish river
winding and on the nearer bank of the
river a camp of more than a thousand tents
with ranks of camels and horse herds graz-
ing near the water

   the chu billings decided

  and the camp of the black kirghiz
assented alashan gravely

  they looked for signs of the horsemen
they had seen along the trail but the
riders had vanished it was late afternoon
and darkness would set in before they could
pick up the tracks again and follow them
down to the river

   alashan pointed out the high black hats
on some of the soldiers in the nearest tents
the stacked arms and the standards topped
by huge elk antlers he judged there were
at least eight thousand of the tribesmen
the distance was too great for billings to
see these particulars but it struck him that
the number of horses was more than that

  true agreed alashan after a pause
the kirghiz have been raiding no kir-
ghiz women are in the camp the horses
have been lifted from the baskirs when
most of the moslem tribesmen were riding
against us

  then it is well we did not follow the
riders down to the chu billings pointed
out you wear the garb of a baskir

  alashan seemed indifferent he was
squinting into the distance trying to read
the answer to the  question i as to what
brought the power of the kirghiz so near
the steppe his face was drawn from
the aul where they had obtained their dis-
guise they had wandered for two days


adventure

beingforced to camp at night in order to
keep the trail in view it had been a test of
endurance and both were still fit they
had drawn on their reserve strength bill-
ings more than the tatar and their eyes
were overbright their hands restless

  what are the kirghiz doing here
asked the map-maker

  the tents seemed to him to be arrayed in
a sort of semicircle facing the height on
which they stood

  said alashan bitterly

  the wild dogs are sitting on their
haunches waiting the jackals have come
from afar the kirghiz live by raiding
down from the mountains but this is
greater than a raid they ride to a
slaying

  hope its not us thought billings
i am going to look at the edge of that
precipice he added aloud that sand-
stone rock might be a watch-tower

  they had not much fear of being seen
from below because numberless masses of
sandstone made the summit of the slope
jagged as if it were a crenelated battle-
ment billings climbed from his saddle
and slipped down the slope holding to the
points of the rocks he was careful not
to dislodge any of the soft fragments of
stone coming to the edge he ducked down
and lying on his belly stared over the brink
he was looking at sonkor

  the precipice was nearly sheer a wall
cf red and purple stone beneath which
stood a black temple it was black from
the top of its twin towers to the crude wall
of flat rocks that surrounded its courtyard
its lines were curiously deceptive

  the walls slope in markedly and so
do the towers he thought let me see
two five seven rows of windows arrow
slits rather must be seven stories high
the slope inward must make it look gigan-
tic from the chu

  the peculiar black appearance was due
to the stone used-granite and basalt
evidently brought by boat from the upper
gorges of the chu billings was observing
for the first time some of the devices used
by the tibetan lamas to make their temples
formidable in looks as well as strength
in lhassa there were monastery halls with
pillars of chenars that did not grow within
a thousand miles

  he saw too that more tents of the kirghiz
were clustered just outside the courtyard

wall and that the court and the roofs of the
temple were quite deserted

  returning to alashan he reported what
he had seen the boy was all for searching
out a way down the cliff billings nodded
but their exhausted horses stood with heads
close to the ground and legs quivering

  done for billings reflected foods
gone sunset-dark in half an hour
he glanced at alashan can we enter
the kirghiz camp it surrounds the tem-
ple on three sides and on the other side is
the cliff

  nadesha is there in the lamasery
true and loosang is there ala-
shan to-night js the sixth of his nine nights
away from the horde it is in my mind
that tomorrow he must mount again to ride
to the northwest if we are to reach na-
desha before he goes it must be this night
true alashan gnawed his lip in
the dark we can slip through the camp
keeping away from the watch fires within
the lamasery we would find the going
harder no one is allowed within the
temple gate except the guests of the lamas

and they are watched by armed guards-

  i saw no guards

  they watch from the embrasures if
the sons of the devil are all within the
temple it means they are preparing a
ceremonial for the night if so the doors
of the lamasery will be closed

  billings tethered his horse reflectively
to a dead oak and shrugged even the
moon had been obscured for three nights
as if to make their efforts useless to get
down the cliff in the dark would be hard
work for a pseudo-baskir and a cossack
bravo to penetrate into the temple of bon
would be a problem to find nadesha and
speak with her under the nose of loosang
would be a miracle-if indeed nadesha
had actually reached sonkor

  but alashan was convinced that she was
there so far the instinct of the boy of the
steppe had proved true

  have you a plan billings asked the
son of the khan

  alashan laughed for the first time since
the map-maker had known him

  i have no plan captain but i feel that
a way will be opened look there are
vultures in the sky over the camp and the
sunset is red-the gate in the sky is red
there will be blood under our feet this night
kai-i know it
the road of the giants



  hes a fool of a pagan and a savage
thought billings but may the black
pest take me i cant let him go down into
that cesspool of satan alone ill stand
by him until nadesha is found or the boy
gets his throat slit then ill look after
myself

  a brazen thunder shook their eardrums
it seemed as if the very clouds overhead
had trumpeted down a challenge billings
swore and clutched at his sword hilt ala-
shan glanced up from narrowed eyes

  again came the note of the trumpets
repeated three times fainter and more
mellow an echo came back from the
mountains across the river

  by a common impulse the man and the
boy turned and ran back toward the sum-
mit of the slope leading to the cliff look-
ing over the rise cautiously they beheld
four black figures below them on the edge
of the cliff four bronze -trumpets longer
than the tall musicians were leveled out
across the valley

  then the horns were lowered over the
precipice and the three notes repeated
this done the four lamas turned to one
side in single file and disappeared among
the nest of rocks that billings had called a
pulpit

  billings chuckled under his breath he
could see thousands of ant-like figures
running out of the kirghiz tents to stare up
at the cliff

  the way is opened whispered alashan
there must be a passage down to the
temple from the spot

  they crept after the four from boulder
to boulder until they came to a sandstone
ridge halved by a wide crack alashan
pointed to the print of feet in the dust here
entering the shadow between the rocks they
left daylight behind them at once

  shelving downward the path turned aside
into what seemed solid rock but here
billings saw the gleam of a candle far down
and ahead of them quickening their
pace they hurried on and at the next turn
made out the trumpeters in single file
the leader with the candle

  the immense horns delayed the progress
of the lamas so that billings and alashan
kept up with them easily the cleft had
changed to a kind of wide tunnel twisting
and irregular only in the steepest de-
scents were steps cut into the soft stone
limestone billings believed and judged

that water had cut this channel down into
the valley of the chu hundreds of years
ago when the river was still eating its way
down to its present course

  more than once they passed along the
floor of a lofty cavern their steps muffled
by the inch-deep carpet of white powdered
rock and once they edged warily across
a natural bridge over such a cavern almost
losing sight of the candle as they did so

  the air grew much warmer they were
forced to stoop now to work down a low
passage billings judged that the air here
was heated by the rays of the afternoon sun
on the cliff outside and that they must be
close to the entrance nor was he wrong
- he muttered

 he had seen the lama in the lead
pause at a heavy wooden door and knock
the portal swung open stooping the four
trailed out with their horns the door
swung shut billings and the boy were
in total darkness both knew that they
could not find their way back true they
had flint and steel and some jbowder but
there was nothing in the cavern to ignite

  they made their wray down to the door
knocking their heads more than once
feeling the stout boards cautiously and
pressing against them billings decided the
portal was barred on the outside wiping
the sweat out of his eyes he considered 
alashan he whispered the lamas have
stationed a guard at this end of the passage
the men with the horns did not open the
door themselves there was a sentry on
the other side good we will knock and
get ourselves admitted to the presence of
bon before the guard goes elsewhere

  he did so rather hastily it had occurred
to him suddenly that the lama on watch
might have gone away after the others
being posted at the door to let them in
but it was likely if anything unusual was
in the -wind that evening that a man would
be stationed to watch the door

  a step sounded on the other side of the
barrier billings knocked again loudly
as if he had a right to enter one of the
bars was taken down then silence

  plainly the man on the other side was
puzzled billings rapped a third time
impatiently

  stand back he ordered alashan softly
be ready

 the other bar came down the door
swung toward them concealing them in its
adventure

onadow a shaven head wrinkled and
bare as a snakes was thrust into the
passage

  a flash followed by the sound of metal
striking bone alashan had brought down
the back of his sword viciously on the
priests pate the man sprawled forward
coughing writhed and alashan struck again
this time with the edge then he caught
the long cassocked form and tugged jt
well into the passage billings was not
prepared for this

  tchou my cousin alashan hissed
would you tie a viper with silk or play
with an adder in the dark besides he
is not dead you do not know these devils
look

  he lifted the head of the guard pulling
back the lips from the teeth billings
saw that they were sharpened to points
he glanced out of the passage no one
else was visible

  a lamp glimmered in a basin of oil beside
the doorway they could make out that
the room outside the passage was very
lofty that its walls were the white limestone
itself in the center of the chamber directly
in front of them was what appeared to be a
broad column of black lacquer

  after alashan had closed the door and
replaced the bars leaving the unconscious
lama in the passage they searched the walls
for another exit a second door stood
opposite the first and this also was locked
on the outside

  billings listened at the crack and made
out a dull murmur some distance away
it was the camp of the kirghiz he
knocked tentatively but this time there
was no response

  stop alashan caught his arm if
we are seen coming from here it will be the
end of everything

 he pointed up over his head they
could see the front of the lacquer column
now the candle behind it framed in
blackness a score of arms projecting from
the sides

  a spider muttered billings

  bon said alashan softly the de-
stroyer

  the entangled arms ended in hands
each gripping some weapon or object in
one was a child in swaddling cloths
snakes and varied beasts kept the child-in
lacquer-company on the breast of bon
who squatted on a square pedestal was a

tiny woman her legs and arms clutching
the broad body of the god

  they could see clearly because a round
window in the rock wall directly in front of
the face of bon admitted the last ruddy
light of sunset the face itself was like a
buddha cold and expressionless

  pfaghi grunted billings

  he could understand now that the lamas
had availed themselves of a large cavern
just inside the cliff wall for a tabernacle
for the figure of the god the opening in
the cliff let in light during the day and per-
mitted worshipers from the plain to see
the face of bon if illumined from within
the effect must be striking

  even as they watched the last gleams
departed from the glittering crown of bon
they looked at each other curiously to
break down the door would be to bring the
lamasery swarming about them to re-
turn to the height by way of the tunnel was
impossible

  there remained the aperture in the cliff
but the rock wall was sheer so the two
intruders sat down and listened to the faint
sounds from the camp they knew that
in time some one would come into the
chamber of bon from the temple to relieve
the guard at the tunnel door then they
might slip out looking up once restlessly
the map-maker drew in his breath

  the countenance of the god was shining
with a soft green light it was a reflection
of some kind

  the moon is up explained alashan
calmly

  suddenly billings chuckled and sprang
to his feet

  i know how we can look from the hole
in the cliff help me up this pedestal

  when alashan had boosted him up to
the footstool of the image billings began
to climb the front of the giant god pulling
himself up by the arms that stuck out in
every direction and the limbs of the
clinging woman now the highest pair
of arms were folded hands crossed just
under the chin of bon so that billings was
furnished a perch within a yard of the round
opening alashan joined him the statue
being fashioned of solid wood under the
lacquer work they were secure

  the ceremonial had begun they looked
out directly over the roof of the lamasery
between the two towers billings fancied
that the door from the cavern led out upon


the road of the giants



the roof itself the moon was rising some-
where to the left over the valley but its
half light was eclipsed by the smoking
glare of lines of torches in the courtyard of
the lamasery here the lamas were stand-
ing in rows forming a lane out of the court
through the kirghiz camp down the slope
toward the chu

  when the moon is full these devils
drag out their idols to the river for all to
see muttered alashan it is at this
time expeditions set out from the land of
the tsong khapa see the black kirghiz
are watching

  already a line of sakyas-neophytes-
carrying lighted pastels were moving out
of the courtyard next was led a black
horse bearing the state robes of the abbot
of sonkor horsemen in yellow cassocks
with painted spears behind a boy carrying
a basin of glowing coals were thin tibetans
with the standards of sonkor-lon poles
wrapped around with rags

  a tawdry manner of finery thought
billings hulloa

  following the standards and pulled by
other rows of disciples came a cart filled
with women wearing lotus flowers and
carrying the blossoms in their hands
seated among these women was a small
figure wearing a red khcdat and a cloth of
silver cap

  billings glanced at alashan the boy
had recognized nadesha in her persian
dress as she turned her face

  there is nadesha the daughter of
norbo he said calmly but loosang i
do not see

  indeed the cart bearing small painted
images of various gods that came after the
women had no human occupant billings
reflected that here was nadeshas country
of a thousand devils-the land where men
wore the faces of beasts for the lamas
carrying the four trumpets of sonkor were
masked as usual

  but nadesha herself was here-apparent-
ly of her own will-and riding in the cart
with the women attendants of the temple
billings wondered if she had left the hard
lot of the horde for this estate he knew
that alashan who loved nadesha fiercely
did not believe this he himself suspected
that nadesha was up to one of her games
a trick that bade fair to be her last because
it was loosang she tricked and the lama
had her in his power

   

  climb down whispered alashan curtly

  not until he had quit the circle of sub-
dued light did billings hear the sound of
the opening door that had aroused the boy
it was too late to gain the ground they
waited poised on the fat belly of bon the
destroyer three men entered the outer
door

  loosang was the leader the two others
were bearded tribesmen wearing heavy
black lambs wool hats and with girdles
literally stuffed with weapons-good ones
for all their swagger they eyed the great
form of bon sidewise and billings was
grateful for the deep shadow that covered
the front of the god

  as if puzzled by the absence of the guard
loosang inspected the inner door the can-
dle and walked around the image of bon
then satisfied that no one was to be found
in the rock chamber he squatted down
facing the tribesmen

  so long did the chutuktu wait before
speaking that one a red-haired giant looked
up

  where is that russian money you

fox

  in the tents of the horde nuralin
khan

  they spoke freely believing themselves
alone and in tatar the common speech
of the steppe billings did not understand
it all but learned later from alashan what
had passed afterward billings decided
that loosang had taken pains to stow this
cache away for himself where no one would
find it

  hai it shall be ours loosang my owl
and the horses and camels of the horde-
tens of thousands of them you say and
their weapons bought of the muscovites
captured from the turks good pieces you
swear if you have lied ill make you
dine off your cassock

  he leered at the lama blinking nura-
lin khan had kissed the jug that night
then he began to stroke his unkempt
beard with a hand on which the very hairs
were red

  all that is very well my chutuktu
but you claim half the spoil that is too
much even for a devil like you

  if it is too much then you and your dogs
can search out the horde on the open steppe
attack them there if you will and see if
you will raise their hides or not loosang
spoke coldly


adventure

  the other kirghiz a stunted man with a
pinched mouth and evil eyes snarled at
this

  you have sworn an oath loosang
you have pledged your word to lead the
horde to the place where we will wait in
the hills if the torguts go the other way
over the plain to balkash then you will
have no profit nay our paths lie to-
gether in this keep faith with us or we
will bring our cannon to knock down the

walls of sonkor-

  fool spawn of a lizard will you go
against the word of him who is master of
lhassa

  the elder kirghiz fell silent but nura-
lin khan swaying as he sat continued his
grumbling

  you will sit safe in your yurt loosang
while we face the arrows and the flintlocks
of the torguts ubaka khan is an ox
he will take a lotof killing

  and i- loosangs lips drew back-
have arranged that ubaka will not be at
the head of the horde when you strike it
there is another khan in the horde who will
see to that

  this impressed the two chieftains they
looked at each other and asked the name of
the lamas confederate but loosang was
not telling all he knew

  how many riders have you nuralin
khan

  a thousand and another thousand
tents more will join us at the appointed
place

  you were foolish to plunder the baskirs
with those wolves hanging on the flanks
of the horde your task would be easier
and there would be more to share the
russian money in the torgut tents the
leather and furs and weapons and horse-
flesh as it is a half is too much for you
a half of my share goes to lhassa the
dalai lama is pleased to be angry with
the torguts because they favor the old
beliefs and turn their eyes to natagai in
the skies

  so they must die eh wellit is all one
to us provided you keep faith nuralin
khan considered ubaka has been driv-
ing his men and beasts too hard my
jigits are in from the kangar and they say
the horde is weak-weak

  loosang stuck out his long neck as if
pleased the baskirs he explained had

  	about fifteen thousand men

done that the russians under trauben-
berg had not followed the horde beyond
orenburg so the moslem clan had pur-
sued the torguts on its own account
ubaka had thought the russian army
was on the march and the baskirs its
advance

  when he might have rested in the fertile
lands before the kangar ubaka had set
out again on his journey

 how was that demanded the old
kirghiz

  i persuaded him through the khan who
is my friend after the crossing of the
kangar his riders will be like foundered
horses they will go down before your
swords like wheat under the wind not
more than a hundred times a thousand
souls are still living in the horde muster-
ing even old men with spears and young
boys with arrows they will have only fifteen
times a thousand to ride against you
i will arrange that they suspect nothing
that the clans travel far apart the fighting
men mixed with the sick and the animals
you must have your full strength drawn
up at the place agreed on

  the small eyes of nuralin khan twinkled
he stretched massive arms one at a time
and yawned

  the old women and the men will be
slain the younger wromen who are yet
alive-

  half to me

  aye leered the older kirghiz silver
and gold may be had for the tatar youths
in the slave market at bokhara

  it is all one to me drawled nuralin
khan by the lotus you councilors of
the pit can slay many men with words
but my sword must do the work you
foxes

  quickly he lifted his head alashan had
been breathing rapidly during the conver-
sation that revealed the treachery of loo-
sang just then his scabbard had slipped
down from his knee to the full length of its
strap and clanked against the lacquer
image

  nuralin khan sprang to his feet the
moonlight had been growing stronger by it
he could make out cradled in the long arms
of bon aehapeless mass

  tchoul look-it moves

  the rat-faced chief perhaps remembering
that they had been speaking none too
reverently of the sacred gods ran to the
the road of the giants

i

outer door nuralin khan followed more
slowly glancing back over his shoulder
loosang stood his ground frowning

  meanwhile alashan actcd he leaped
bodily for the jma but landed heavily
within the shadow in front of the image
plunged down on his hands with the shock
of the fall this was enough for nuralin
khan who fled through the door

  perceiving that he was deserted and
sensing danger loosang slipped out of the
door closing it after him before alashan
could reach him the bars outside the
portal were dropped into place and loo-
sangs high voice lifted in a warning shout

  come alashan billings joined the
boy who stood trembling with anger
sword in hand pick up your hat

  he unbarred the door into the passage
signed for alashan to help and carried the
still unconscious guard back to the spot
where the boy had jumped down

  loosang did not see yom i watched
pray that some tribesmen come in with
the priests

  he quenched the lamp and drew the
tatar baclwith him  into the passage
closing ther door nearly but not quite
almost immediately the outer portal swung
open and a dozen armed lamas appeared
loosang among them

  the torches that the newcomers carried
soon revealed the prostrate figure under
the pedestal of bon after scanning the
chamber and finding nothing else amiss
tjaey advanced to stare at the guard
they turned him over noticing the bruise
on his shaven skull

  then loosang looked up at the giant
bon as if puzzled he had seen a man
drop in the shadow here was a man
with a bruise on his head palpably this
servant of the temple had been playing
the spy and-of all places-in the arms of
the destroyer loosang was not satisfied

  with a cry one of the tibetans pointed
out the deep sword-cut across the side of
the wounded man they pressed closer
lowering the torches to see better some
tribesmen edged inside the door in the
wake of nuralin who had sobered rapidly
this moment billings chose to slip out of the
door opening from the passage and move
along the wall with alashan they were
concealed by the shadow cast by the ring
of priests

  the passage shouted loosang noticing

the door whoever has entered has gone
back that way

  although the most degenerate of men
the lamas were not lacking in zeal daring
or intelligence they rushed into the pas-
sage for the most part others bore out
the body of the guard and started to clear
the staring kirghiz out of the temple

  billings and alashan had joined the
tribesmen during the confusion the map-
maker had pinned his trust to human curios-
ity but this same trait was now causing the
kirghiz-who had been drinking-to won-
der how a cossack and a baskir were in
their company

  once outside the door however billings
gave them no time to grow more suspicious
but made off down the first stairway to
hand it led through the refectory of the
temple out into the courtyard coming
from within the temple they were not
challenged

  they pushed through groups of the
lamas went out into the camp and turned
aside among the lines of camels where
there were no fires alashan wanted to go
down toward the river to find nadesha

  listen my captain he said briefly
what we have heard must come to the
ears of ubaka khan my father we
have not yet learned the place where the
kirghiz will lie in wait for the horde we
must know that nadesha will find out
then we will take her with us and steal
horses from the cordon

  they came to the wagons standing by the
river bank most of the women of the
temple had mingled with the crowd of
soldiers and were laughing and singing about
the near-by fires where feasting was going
on in honor of the festival

  nadesha however still sat on the edge of
the temple cart a lotus flower between her
lips her dark eyes rimmed with kohl sur-
veying the crowd that kept at a respect-
ful distance for loosang mounted and
wearing his yellow robe of office was beside
her a half-dozen armed lamas close behind
him around the wagon eddied groups
of tribesmen thin turkomans squat tur-
baned chatagais quarrelsomely drunk

  the vultures are flying together
whispered the boy bitterly they would
not attack the horde in fair battle they
seek a corpse to pick bare with their beaks
billings nudged the youth to silence
it was all-important that they speak with


adventure

nadesha before loosang and the women
withdrew into the lamasery where no
tribesmen would be welcome just then
nuralin khan swaggered up having re-
covered from his scare at the temple he
advanced close to nadesha hands on hips

by the belly of bon here is a wanton to
make glad the eye of a chief a round face
and a bright eye a form fair and melting
nadesha smiled at him and the kirghiz
sought to take her hand

  peace nuralin khan shrilled loosang
she is a tatar who has claimed the pro-
tection of the god

  tatar or persian-all one to me mum-
bled the other

  and billings seeing his chance thrust
alashan back pushing the cossack hat
over one eye and lifting the green neckcloth
to cover his mouth he lurched forward
clapped nuralin khan on the back and
leaned heavily against the wagon his head
almost upon nadeshas knee

  nuralin khan looked around his hand
on a pistol but seeing only a besotted cos-
sack he spat and returned to his quarrel
with the lama loosang glanced keenly
at billings but the red-haired chieftain was
between them

  meanwhile billings kept muttering to
himself the girl at first glanced con-
temptuously at him then her eyes widened
and she leaned forward apparently to watch
what was going on between the others

  captain beel-ing she whispered in
russian

  alashan is with me returned billings
how can you leave the wagon and join
us

  i can not the men of loosang have
orders to seize me if i put foot down from
the cart of the women

  nadesha smiled gratified that two men
had risked their lives for her she could
not keep her eyes from seeking out alashan
in the shadows

  ai-a her mobile face clouded why
did you disobey my word and leave the
horde i planned for you to show them
the right road when loosang tries to lead
them where death waits

  we will all go back together nadesha
that is-you and alashan

  billings broke off to curse a staring
chatagai and thrust the man away the
mountaineer laid hand on knife and eclipsed
billings curse with a vitriolic insult bil-

lings drew his sword and the tribesman
edged back muttering

  harken captain beel-ing cried the
girl i have found out that for which i
came hither loosang plots with the
kir-

  i know alashan seeks to learn the
place of ambush

  the ford of the river kara-su remem-
ber and go rejoin the horde

  alashan will not go without you
said billings and repeated the kara-su
kai the girls eyes glowed with
pride he must go to his clan loosang
will ride there too he must leave me in
sonkor tell alashan that i will escape
before long

  but billings knew there was little chance
of that nadesha it seemed had tricked
loosang to do so she had thrown her
own life into the hazard he had not
realized before how much he liked nadesha

  she threw off the hand of the kirghiz and
pretended to turn her shoulder to him

  alashan must ride with the news she
whispered to billings then ubaka in
truth will call him a man and the horde

will know him for a son of the khan-

  breaking off swiftly she lifted her chin
i am the woman of loosang the chu-
tuktu go cossack and wallow with your
pigs of christians

  billings had been too intent on her tidings
to heed the silence that had fallen about
them now he saw that nuralin khan had
drawn back that the chatagai was whisper-
ing to loosang and that all eyes were on
his naked sword too wise to try to leave
the cart billings coughed and rolled his
head stupidly aping a drunken son of the
steppe the lama head thrust forward
surveyed him

  you ride far from your steppe cossack
he observed in russian

  billings blinked as if beholding the abbot
for the first time

  aye batko father-i followed a thieving
baskir and lost my way on the kangar

  he mumbled his words but loosang
pricked up his ears billings russian was
far from perfect

  a cossack-lost his way on the steppe
that is a lie

i kissed the jug once too often father
a cossack-with a frankish rapier
his long straight blade had excited the
curiosity of the angered chatagai who had
the road of the giants



pointed it out to loosang all the cossack
sabers were curved after the lines of the
moslem simitar billings was reluctant
to open his mouth again but there was no
help for it

  i had it from a merchant in zaritzan
devil take you priest if you want to sam-
ple the blade set a tribesman against me
come do

  the other tribesmen pressed closer and
nuralin khan laid one huge hand on a long
pistol stock he had guessed the meaning
of billings words

   i will shoot the heart out of the dog he
proclaimed lifting the weapon

  peace the lama held up his hand
that sword i have seen before ekh-
here is the giaour the christian prisoner of
the tatars

  nuralin khan craned forward interested
a thin smile spread the lips of the lama

  aye this is the brother of nadesha
who would make a map from the sun to
guide the horde

  his vindictive delight showed how much
billings seizure meant to the priest

  now my way is clear he was whisper-
ing to nuralin khan

  loosang chutuktu broke in nadesha
i have kept my promise i have delivered
the giaour to you in your hands now i
claim protection of the gods

  her brown eyes flashed warningly at
billings as if to tell him that she would yet
find a way out but the maker of maps
was eyeing nuralin khans pistol words
he knew could not help matters now a
few sword strokes and it would be all over
one way or the other he set his back
against the cart and waited loosang bent
toward the girl

  harlot he said the spy has spoken
with you

  and he struck nadesha on the lips as
he did so a figure in a soiled khalat and
loose turban slipped between the chatagai
and nuralin khan

  alashan decided matters in his own way
with the dagger clutched in his left hand
he stabbed loosang the knife striking into
the ribs of the lama a squeal of pain
came from the tall mens teeth

  a flurry in the throng a general cry of
rage alashan leaped to the cart as men
rushed at him he threw the dagger into
their faces caught nadesha up in both
irms sprang off the opposite side of the

wagon here in comparative darkness
there were no bystanders

  to the river shouted billings

  he parried the stroke the chatagai
aimed at his head thrust the man through
the throat freeing his blade he slashed
wide at another face and jumped to the
cart

  nuralin khans pistol blazed and the
powder blast stung his hand billings turned
and ran after alashan and nadesha the
boy had set nadesha on her feet and the
twain were running swiftly away from the
torches between the tents a lane opened
up ahead of them and at the end of it
gleamed the surface of the chu

  the thudding of feet behind him told
billings that pursuit was close he halted
and swung about crouching a spear
whistled over his shoulder and his blade
clashed against the simitar of a kirghiz
the man staggered from a thrust in the
stomach and another who followed at his
heels drew back before the glitter of steel

  billings turned and dashed off looking
about for a horse instead he saw a group
of armed men at the end of the tents and
alashan and nadesha struggling furiously
against overpowering force

  captain billings shouted the boy his
voice breaking leave us ride to the
horde-warn my father-

  there was a sharp snap as his sword
broke nadesha was still making play
with her dagger but billings saw at once
that they were as good as captives indeed
as he changed his course and darted be-
tween two tents he heard alashan singing
his death chant defiantly 

  after all alashan had taken his own way
in dealing with loosang for once luck
favored billings and he found himself
among a nest of felt tents-the quarters of
somenoble tripping over the ropes be
dodged about catching glimpses of running
men and turning away from the glare of
torches

  in front of him he sighted the river a
dense thicket of reeds lining its bank this
however was the goal toward which his
pursuers were headed a group of them
were plunging close behind him but mo-
mentarily he was in shadow and they had
lost the scent

  billings halted looked about and flung
himself on the ground crawling under the
side of a pavilion small chance he


adventure

thought for him on the water so bright was
the moon as he expected the large tent
was vacant the occupants-if there had
been any within just then-having run out
at the noise of the pursuit

  it was a large tent belonging to a person
of importance and a filigreed bronze lamp
hung from the top of the pole garments
skins weapons were scattered about bil-
lings tore off his cossack coat and cap
selected the first fur-edged khalat his hand
touched and donned a huge black lambskin
hat that came down over his ears

  only a moment remained before the
lamas would begin investigating che tents
billings ducked out as he had come and
began to walk quickly back toward the
temple

  theyll be harrying the river and the
outskirts of the blessed encampment
he reasoned it wont do to leave for a
while

  suddenly perceiving that his sword was
still bare in his hand the blade smirched
with blood he thrust it under the khalat
and swaggered on slowly pausing when
lights went past and avoiding the camp
fires

  this wont do either he reflected
the kirghiz will be looking for a cossack
to be sure but the eyes of those devils of
lamas-i cant chance that

  as a matter of fact the tribesmen he
passed paid no attention to him he saw
nothing more of alashan or nadesha the
tumult had quieted down but he noticed
that the number of torches flickering among
the reeds had increased and that armed and
mounted lama were patrolling every main
avenue of the camp it would be only a
matter of time before they recognized him
if he remained where he was

  heading back to where he and alashan
had passed among the herds he came to a
fire a mere bed of embers over which a
caldron smoked with an appetizing odor
several sleepy horse guards were lying about
these billings joined one muttered

  temou chu dweff in peace

  ahatoti-brother responded the map-
maker dipping his hand into the caldron-
he was aware all at once that he was giddy
from hunger there were still portions of
mutton in the pot and of these he ate
ravenously from time to time kirghiz
came to the horse lines saddled animals
and rode off

  a very wizard of a giaour is afoot we
must take him one said in reply to a lazy
question from the men around the fire
no doubt he was drowned in the river 
may the black plague take the lamas

  another who sauntered up from the direc-
tion of the temple did not even seek out a
horse but squatted down to light his pipe
from the embers

  they have the tatar buck and his
fiend of a girl up at the temple he ob-
served yawning

  have they been tortured yet some
one asked

  nay loosang has sworn that the prince-
ling and the woman shall be taken by the
lamas to our ambush on the kara-su so
that their eyes shall see the death of their
clan

  the moon by now was low to the west
and billings judged by the mist over the
river and the feel of chill in the air that the
night was well advanced his companions
all but one who smoked and spat into the
fire at regular intervals were snoring the
camp was dark except for the towers of
sonkor upon which the moon still struck
over the trees

  it was time for billings to move lei-
surely he rose went to the pile from which
he had seen kirghiz taking saddles selected
one and moved toward the line of horses
from the corners of his eyes- he watched
the dark bulk that was the wakeful horse
guard the mans pipe glowed on tran-
quilly

  evidently billings stay at the fire had
disarmed any suspicion nevertheless he
was uneasy until he had secured what he
sought-from the piles of gear by the cordon
-saddle bags with a fair quantity of rice
dates and dried meat then he flung the
saddle on a large pony praying that his
choice might be a good one adjusted the
halter and mounted

  peace be with you brother muttered
the guard

  guiding himself by the loom of the cliff
on his left he threaded his way through the
camp once he passed a patrol coming in
quickening his pace he hastened to be
out of sight of the camp before dawn should
come

  his luck held good that night a heavy
mist rolled up from the river and although
billings heard sentries calling more than
once he was not stopped the memory of
the road of the giants



the fox-like faces of the lamas made him use
his spurs

  with daybreak he reasoned they
will follow any single track out of the camp
but i could swim my horse across the chu
strike down south toward tashkent and be
out of their reach in a few hours

  the river beckoned him to safety
once in the caravan routes to turkestan he
would be on his way back -to astrakan
this was what he had planned-extept
that alashan and nadesha were prisoners
of loosang instead of free on the other
hand north of him was the kangar and
he was in poor shape to cross the desert
again true it would be skirting the east-
ern edge of it this time but the country was
strange to him and without alashan he would
 be at a disadvantage and soon the warrior
monks doubtless would hit upon his track

  alashan and nadesha were dead or as
good as dead he ruminated evten if he
should carry the word of the ambush to the
horde it would not help them a whit in
fact if he reached the horde he was not at
all sure he would be believed

   he was very tired after the exertions of
the night the pleading eyes of nadesha
would not be dismissed from his mind
what was it the girl had said-when two are
brothers neither abandons the other

  plague take it muttered captain
billings he jerked his horses head to the
left and trotted into the gullies that led up
the slope to the north toward the kangar

   well have a return match with loosang
and it will be a good one

   as if to echo his words from behind and
below him came the blast of the morning
trumpet call of sonkor

chapter vii

the ambush

   the prudent man crosses the river at the ford the
 shrewd merchant when his path leads into the moun-
 tains turns aside and seeks a valley

   the foolish one swims his horse across the river
and spurs from peak to peak

   yet when death comes to the twain it often happens
 that the wise man lies in a grave forgotten in the valley
 while over his head on the mointain summit stands the
 gold-adorned tomb of him who was unwise

-proverb

fortune captain minard billings
was fond of saying was very much
like a wild horse it would never wait when
you came after it with a halter but for

all that luck had served him well in many
a tight place and this perhaps was be-
cause he never waited for fortune to knock
at his door

  so it was at the kara-su the black river
this was the stream that marked the
boundary between the hills of the kirghiz
and the clay waste of the kangar before
it reached the water his pony died by his
calculation he was yet a long days ride
from the torguts who he judged were
moving eastward across the kangar

  the trail he had been following north
and east led down through the foot-hills
to a ford-the river at that season in spring
was in flood-and here he fell in with some
tajiks fleeing down the stream they told
him that they had seen the dust of the
horde moving toward the kara-su from
the steppe

  billings drank his fill washed crossed the
river and walked briskly toward the steppe
a little more than a mile out where the
familiar gullies began a camel rider ap-
peared followed by a party of horsemen

  without more than a curious glance at
billings they pressed ahead their sweat-
darkened beasts had scented the river
then the sun glimmered on the points of
lances and the long barrels of flintlocks
through the dust ahorse and afoot thread-
ing the gullies came the red camel clan-
red in truth with the baked dust that
coated them invisible on either hand
billings heard the lioa-hoa of men driving
animals the scuffle of hoofs and once the
eager cry of a child

  the horde had sighted the river yet
the cracked faces of the marchers showed no
animation their eyes were half-closed in a
ceaseless squint some slept in the saddle
they moved steadily on and the loads
they carried were the same with which
they had entered the kangar a hundred
and fifty miles back four days ago bil-
lings was enveloped in a sea of moving
things

  in order to stop the horde he must find
norbo scrambling up a hillock he caught
sight of zebek dortshi in the center of the
clan brilliant in his crimson and velvet

  billings knew that the horde was far out
of its true course-far to the south he
suspected that the fact zebek dortshi was
leading accounted for this and on the
other side of the river death was lying in
wait


adventure

  the quick-eyed chieftain noticed billings
cossack dress and urged his horse over to-
ward the hillock behind zebek dortshi
came a group of riders ubaka in the center
the khan seemed weary dried blood caked
the corners of his mouthand his woolen coat
was thrown back exposing his knotted bare
chest norbo was not to be seen among
the riders who were all noyons of the council

  billings although zebek dortshi was the
last man he wished to meet hastened down
toward them and raised his hand his
message could wait no longer

  i have word for the khan he shouted
in russian

  zebek dortshis brown eyes flickered as
he recognized billings and he spurred his
horse to keep between the map-maker and
the other torguts

  what is your message he asked

  but billings moved aside and caught the
eye of ubaka the khan reined in with a
frown

  where is my son he demanded

  the other khans pressed up close to
billings staring at him and talking to-
gether in guttural whispers they were
restless and he suspected that there had
been dissension in the council he won-
dered how much norbo had confessed to
ubaka lifting his hand to his forehead
in greeting he spoke

  may the way be open before you
ubaka khan  i have a message from
alashan from sonkor

  they were silent at this all eyes intent
zebek dortshi gnawed his mustache and
moved his horse nearer to the englishman
who was now surrounded by a solid ring of
riders

  hail you have gone far and fast
where is your horse

  the chief of the red camel clan looked
around at the others as if to warn them that
he discredited billings

  dead on the other side of the kara-su

  the kara-su is that near

  it was ubaka khan who spoke his deep
voice ringing with amazement billings re-
flected that zebek dortshi seemed to
know where they were while the khan did
not

  a mile behind me those hills-
billings turned and pointed to the wooded
heights two miles away-are on the farther
bank i passed through them yesterday
some shepherds on the river told me the

horde was coming this way so i waited
to give you the word of alashan

  where is my son that he will not face
his father

  a prisoner nadesha likewise

  the tatars waited quietly even the
khan showed no emotion alashan his
son had left the horde without permission
from his father and so in the eyes of the
tatars both were disgraced accordingly

  billings pointed to where some armed
riders of the wolf clan were coming along
the trail norbo among them

   the master of the herds he said can
tell you why alashan left the horde and
why he is in danger

  now old norbo was a faithful servant of
ubaka khan but he had never learned to
shape his words like a courtier he spoke
what was in his mind when he had to do so
and so he did now dismounting he
pressed the stirrup of ubaka khan to his
forehead and drawing back raised a
scarred hand to his head and lips

  speak said the khan

  lord your son saw vultures gathering
in the sky nadesha too had seen she
left me without asking my will and rode to
sonkor alashan and this prisoner fol-
lowed to learn what was to be found out at
i the temple of the lamas he could not go
to his father for permission because he
suspected treachery in those about the
khan

  treachery zebek dortshi laughed
aloud twisting the while the curls of his
beard with deft fingers aye it is in my
mind that treachery is afoot hear my
word o khan

   knowing his listeners the persian tatar
paused until sure that he would be under-
stood he was a skilful orator

  hear my word ubaka khan he re-
peated and he did not give the other the
title of ruler of the horde  is it reason-
able to think that those suckling brats
alashan and nadesha would have tried
to ride to sonkor captain billings is the
sworn enemy of your son would they be
comrades all in a day not so

   smiling he shook his head

  not so and what word could this
giaour bring from sonkor that is not known
to loosang the all-wise bethink you
khan did not loosang warn you against
this stranger from bevond the volga
tchu he did
the road of the giants	



  then zebek dortshi frowned as if
scornful of such tricks as billings might
play

  this is what has happened members of
the sarga the giaour has fought with
alashan perhaps slain him aye to avert
the anger of ubaka khan the giaour has
tried to flee he failed then he has made
lies so that his crime shall be overlooked
loosang the lama is all-wise he foretold
that evil would come of the stranger cut
off the fellows tongue pierce his eyes and
let us by the sacred kandjur ride on to the
water i have spoken

  and well-you have said well cried
several of the younger chieftains

  speak giaour snarled ubaka khan

  billings had been waiting for this chance

  the khan of the red camels lies he
said bluntly and here is the proof that
the treachery was not of my doing

  he pointed behind him to where the
endless stream of riders was moving
through the dust toward the gray glimmer
that was the kara-su

   the horde has been led out of its path in
the time that i was not with the clans
there lies the kara-su the black stream
beyond you can see the mountains the foot-
hills of the kara-bagh that mark the terri-
tory of the black kirghiz lake balkash
lies back on your left and it is far-far
tell me who guided you hither

  all eyes turned toward zebek dortshi
but just then was heard the sound of blaring
horns and creaking axles through the
dust came the painted yurt of the priests
on the trail abreast the gathering of horse-
men it paused once more the gylongs
sounded their horns and waited in the
attitude of heralds

  loosang appeared in the entrance of his
tent house he wore a purple cassock and
his thin face was ghastly so that the skin
seemed yellow parchment stretched over
bones

  the sleep of nine days has ended he
proclaimed in his high voice all of the
khans except ubaka-who ranked with the
lama-norbo and the chieftain of  the
bear clan dismounted and bent to the
girdle

  my spirit tatars has been in the holy
places it has been in the mountains of the
tsong kappa i have a message for the
torguts it is this continue your jour-
ney drink in peace of the water you see in

front of you camp on the farther bank of
the river have no fear but i will lead you

to balkash and the valley of the ili

  a murmur of approval greeted this
the khans stood erect looked eagerly to-
ward the gleam of water zebek dortshi
well pleased took snuff

  by jove thought billings the old
conjurer can ride no wonder zebek
dortshi was sure of his ground-after he
had been speaking with the confounded
lama

  to the tatars-those who acknowledged
the dalai lama-the pallor of the chutuktu
was ample proof of the long trance to which
he had subjected himself

  norbo knowing that billings was a
skilled geographer and that nadesha had
set great store by the englishmans map
drew forth the chart of the steppe that
billings had made he showed it to
ubaka and the map-maker explained their
position pointing out how the horde had
left the route to balkash

  with a word loosang dismissed it

  here are marks upon paper there is a
riverand water

  the tatars shouted approval and glared
at billings but ubaka who had been
silent lifted his head with a roar

quiet dogs giaour have you a token
that you have been to sonkor for if you
have then this river is verily the kara-su
they snarled and zebek dortshi laid
his hand openly on his sword hilt

  a token billings eyes blazed by
my faith i have one it is the message
from your boy alashan

  a boy mocked zebek dortshi fiercely
who rides after a girl men of the sarga
will you listen to the word of a dishonored

tatar-

  -who may die at the hand of your ene-
mies for sending this word barked bil-
lings alashan warns you that nuralin
khan and ten thousand black kirghiz are in
ambush across that river

  a he

  easily proved my khan send patrols
into the mountains and if they come out
unhurt i wall break my sword and let you
cut off my skin zebek dortshi the
kirghiz were at my heels the last three
days he swung around to face ubaka
they hold your son and nadesha the
lamas hold them loosang has betrayed
the horde to nuralin khan
adventure

  stirred by this the tatars iwpunted in-
stinctively and each man felt for his weap-
ons ubakas broad face darkened his
slow brain grappled with the problem while
his great hands clenched

  proof snarled zebek dortshi ignoring
the suggestion to explore the land across
the river

  i will give it loosang at sonkor
offered the horses and women of the horde to
nuralin khan i heard it and alashan too

  mad are you said the khan of the
red camels his brow clearing for it is
known that loosang has been within that
tent- he pointed at the purple yurt from
which the streamers hung limp and stained
-for nine days

  not so alashan stabbed him in the
chest when the lama struck nadesha
bid loosang open his cassock and you will
see the mark of the wound fresh and scarce
healed

  loosang alone had remained calm to
billings surprize the lama slipped the long
garment off his shoulders and opened a
heavy quilted vest as thick as a mans fist
over his ribs they could all see the dark red
slit in the flesh made by a knife billings
realized that the quilt had kept the dagger
from reaching a vital spot under the ribs
loosang laid a yellow finger on the seal
tranquilly

  it is true-true- his high voice broke
the silence-that alashan stabbed me
true that the boy was hot with anger
because nadesha his betrothed had sought
the protection of the gods seven days ago
when my body lay in this yurtthe boy and
the giaour entered my wagon by force
many tatars saw it

  true echoed the gylongs and more than
one chieftain

  then alashan stabbed me and fled
you norbo know of that you saw him
fly from the sacred yurt

  the old master of the herds was speech-
less confused by the swift wit of the priest
there was a cry of anger as he failed to
deny the charge loosang raised his eyes
to the sky

  but my spirit tatars was with the
holy ones at the knees of bon so though
my body was cut open i live many
times you have seen me cut myself with
knives in the rites of bon and no harm came
to me

 alashan a groan broke from the

 cracked lips of ubaka suddenly his
 broad face grew purple by natagai-by
 the shades of our ancient heroes in the sky-
 by the lights of heaven you are lying
 priest you are a snake and your tongue
 poison i believe the word of my son
 get back from the river you dogs halt
 the clans am i khan or a worm that
 lives in dung

   zebek dortshi drew his sword glancing
 around him

   let the sarga give its decision he
 cried is the council the servant of a
 mad ox

   ubaka rose in his stirrups with a bellow
 but norbo and the chieftain of the bear
 clan grasped the reins of his horse it was
 too late for sword strokes loosang had
 turned the scales in favor of the persian
 zebek dortshi had wheeled his horse and
 called for the chieftains to follow him to the
 river

sight of the green fields and the shade
under the dense forest across the kara-su
 were too much for the thirst-tormented
torguts first one then another put spurs
to his horse the dust rose in clouds

   riders who had been awaiting the end of
 the council made off full pelt along the clay
 gullies shouts rose and were repeated
 along the columns of tired torguts

   to the river

   but the yurt of loosang did not move
 a twisted evil face was thrust close to
 billings

   nadesha and alashan whispered loo-
 sang are in the hands of a band of my fol-
 lowers who will let them see the slaying of
 the horde then my trumpets will sound
 and the head of the boy will be cut off
 but you will be taken again to bon-again
 to the arms of the god to bon the de-
 stroyer i wait for that hour

   with that the priest was gone into his
 wagon

   a mass of cattle-the last survivors of the
 herds-came plunging along joining in the
 general rush toward water billings the
 khan norbo and two others who had re-
 mained vere forced to mingle with the
 throng

 the clay gullies ended about a quar-
 ter of a mile from the edge of the
 itjsm- floociei kara-su here the ground
 sloped down evenly to the river but on
 the other side there was a scant two
the road of the giants



hundred yards of lush grass before the forest
set in

  billings scanned the thick screen of alders
that merged into the hemlocks dense over-
head yet clear around the trunks good cover
for an ambush the hills as if designed
for this event were rolling a score of val-
leys opening into the strip of grass-land by
the river

  almost as soon as it began on the farther
bank the trail vanished under the thickets
he could see no sign of men or weapons in
the forest-nothing more than the crows
that circled overhead erratically

  norbo too noticed the birds

  my time has come this dawn when i
looked into the sky i felt that i would be
called

  ubaka rode with his head sunk on his
bare chest he seemed not to hear

  the horde he said between his teeth
that was my grandfathers and his fath-
ers even to the great genghis-the horde
has no longer a khan

  the thought that his son had deserted
him took all the strength from his body
but the mind of the map-maker was alert
when they reached the top of the slope
leading to the water he saw the muskets of
the bear clan  slung over the mens
shoulders like a thicket the heavy
cavalry had kept together even in the
confusion

  by jove he muttered ill make
loosang wait a good while

  the sight of the orderly muskets of the
bear clansmen had roused him and set his
wits to work there was yet time and
something must be done only half of the
red camel riders had crossed the ford
but others were spreading along the bank
of the flooded river looking for places to
cross every moment brought more ta-
tars down from the steppe

  billings could act only by forcing ubaka
khan to act and the chieftain had sunk
into a kind of stupor so billings set his
teeth and stooped down to pick up two
fistfuls of gravel the khan and the men
with him had dismounted

  without warning billings threw the dirt
into the face of ubaka it was perhaps the
worst insult he could have hit upon the
khan started and raised his knotted hands
quivering above his head

  his eyes grew red the next instant
however his head sank again and the

clenched fists beat his bare chest instead of
striking down the map-maker

  aye he muttered it is fitting that
that dirt should be cast upon my beard

 throwing his sheepskin cap on the
ground ubaka khan tore at the long scalp-
lock that fell over his shoulders

  the sarga has turned its back upon me
when i spoke men laughed it is the end

  the face of old norbo writhed in silent
anguish at this display of emotion a
tatar never of his own will reveals pain
bi llings was amazed by the result of his
effort it shocked him to see passing
tatars laugh at the old man to them the
dirt upon ubakas beard and the hair of his
chest was only a proof that zebek dortshi
was now the leader of the horde

  then billings was filled with a cold rage
it was monstrous to watch a whole army
women and children too ride to death
his own fortunes he had ceased to think of
fatigue and the exhaustion of the last ride
from sonkor eclipsed everything but the
one idea-to rouse ubaka khan

  so he said bitterly in russian you
are a woman you tear your hair and let
men spit upon you truly they call you
an ox you let a butcher rip out your
throat and you have not courage enough
to draw back pah

  the red eyes of the chieftain were dazed

  alashan had my honor in his hand
i trusted him i would have made him a
man

  norbo laid his hand on billings shoulder

  forebear giaour

  let be you old dog the maker of
maps shook off the hand do you want
loosang to make nadesha a temple harlot

  seeing norbo start billings pointed to
the heavy cavalry

  those men will help you hold back the
kirghiz the khan is as good as dead but
you and i are still on our feet

 we can give no command without
ubaka khan

  watch me

  billings turned to ubaka and asked
bluntly for the signet ring that- was the
khans seal of office ubaka shook his
head but allowed the master of the herds
to draw it off

  norbo this is what we must do within
an hour the riders of the bear clan are
here keep them in position order the
women and children of your own clan to
o

adventure

the rear and the men here what are these
two others that kept with us

  the chief of the leopard clan and the
master of artillery we have no artillery
nuralin khan has

  billings thought a moment he noticed
for the first time that the ground upon
which the tatars were deploying formed a
kind of half-moon where the kara-su curved
in its course they were in fact on the
highest point of a promontory faced on
three sides by the forest and the hills across
the river all of this ground could be
raked by cannon from the other bank

  it was a good ambush that of nuralin
khan

 -muttered billings norbo send

the chief of the leopard clan to bring up his
armed fighters to the top of this slope
send the women and children and baggage
back along the trail order the master of
your guns to ride far back along your line of 
march when he has reached the clans 
that have not seen the river and do not
know what is happening here tell him to
instruct the khans to muster their able-
bodied men and ride forward with them
alone

  norbo moved away stolidly with the
ring and presently billings saw the two
tatars mount and ride off from a servant
who still attended ubaka billings took a
telescope and studied the ant-like figures of
the red camel tatars that clan had
crossed the river and the men were moving
up slowly into the thickets fires were
being lit here and there saddles were
taken from the horses which were grazing
eagerly some women were singing

  boys were gathering brush from the edge
of the alders and piling it on the fires
below him the herd of cattle had reached
the river bank and were churning the water
into mud a hot sun blazed down on the
grass-still fresh with the moisture of early
summer crickets kept up a chorus that
was dwarfed by the stamping of horses the
creak of leather and the cries of children

  norbo who had been urging the mounted
tatars to charge their muskets and string
their bows returned and wiped the sweat
from his eyes

  who can stem the course of a torrent
he grunted the horde will not hold back
from the river

  the numbers of soldiers around them
had increased but as norbo said the

momentum of the mass was too great to be
easily halted more came up from the
rear with only one thought-to gain the
shade on the farther bank

  hark to the crows muttered norbo
they do not he-i know i know and
there goes zebek dortshis red coat into the
pines	 -

  the red camel clan is lost nodded
billings there is nothing more we can
do

  then norbo raised his hand and the
tatars looked up from the forest across
the river came the blast of a great horn
it echoed down the valley like a brazen
gong under the screen of the pines a
pistol barked a second time faintly
the horn sounded

  the trumpet of the lamas cried norbo
ai-a-men are in those hills

  all noises had ceased in the tatar throng
children looked up at the sky expecting
the sound to be repeated men paused in
the act of unloading the pack-animals

  in the silence billings could hear the
distant hoa-hoa of drivers coming up with
camels from the desert trails but norbo
and his men heard other sounds drowned
until then by the clamor of people around
them horses neighed over in the hills
brush crackled faintly here and there

   men are in those hills repeated norbo
earnestly nodding his gray poll they
are coming this way

  by now bilhngs coud see that the men
of the red camel clan were gathering into
groups other clans who had been about
to cross the river held back the lines of
riders coming over the steppe were at a
standstill the bronzed faces of the tatars
were intent they seemed to be trying to
smell the air

  the momentum of the marching horde
had ceased no longer did the drivers
back on the steppe cry hoa-hoal

  thank god for that horn thought
billings wondering how one of the lamas
with nuralin khan had been so idiotic as to
sound a blast before it was time he
judged that the kirghiz lines had been
placed well back in the hills to allow as
many of the clans as possible to cross the
river before the attack was made

  he observed that boys were running here
and there in the red camel gathering
saddling horses and that the women were
moving back toward the river the men
the road of the giants



were fingering muskets and watching the
line of alders into which more than one
scout had plunged at the sound of the shot

  then from the brush ran a bareheaded
man waving his arms through the tele-
scope billings saw that his kaftan was torn
to shreds a crackle of musket shots
broke out at the back of the fugitive
the crackling spread along the river grew
to a splitting roar and smoke began to float
up over the pines

  the outcry of the crows was no longer
to be heard the groups of red camel
men were thinner all at once for many
seemed to sit and lie down here and
there horses reared a woman carrying a
bundle fell and rolled over kicking up her
booted feet

  inthe ford a herdboy slid off the back of a
camel into the water and did not appear
again wailing came to billings ears and
a curse sounded from near by for the
most part however the tatars schooled
to misfortune were silent even under the
sting of wounds

  look cried norbo pointing

  at intervals on the heights across the
river whole trees fell over the round
black mouths of cannon peered out at them
at once they flashed one at a time and
were hidden in dense white smoke the
balls thudded into the grass or ripped
through the mounted tatars some raised
great spouts of sand

  back in the valleys a half-mile away
across the river the heads of mounted
columns appeared the patter of the
muskets continued steadily

  a few feet beneath billings a little tatar
girl her head bound in a clean white
kerchief was standing hugging a doll it
was one of the household images that every
tatar yurt possesses billings saw the
child start and look at her plaything
blankly

  red drops showed on the face of the felt
doll then the girl began to whimper
all at once she screamed and tried to run
back up the bank her feet failed her but
billings picked her up

  she had been shot through the chest over
the heart knowing that there was nothing
he could do to save her life he laid the
child in a hollow in the bank and mechanic-
ally picked up the doll to put in her lap
she continued to whimper more loudly
but could no longer move

  loosang will pay for that billings
promised himself turning away

  as he was swinging into the saddle of a
passing horse he halted surprized

  ubaka khan was again in the saddle
the old khan had cast off his coat and was
bare to the waist his brown body heavy-
limbed as a bears was erect as he stood in
his short stirrups to see the better he had
grown taller in the last moments and his
glance was hard and quick

  khans of the torguts his tremendous
voice roared out ride to me

  the officers were already doing so
ubaka glanced around and began to swing
his naked sword over his head in a flashing
circle of steel

  where is the tugh fetch the standard
to me you curs assemble your men you
sheep line the ridge with your horsemen
aye shouted one

  tell us what to do father implored
another

  where is ubaka khan-ubaka khan
  cries were heard in all quarters

  all those on the nearer bank could see the
great bulk of the chief under the circle of
steel that never stopped swinging

   hai-hai-hail roared ubaka seeing the
standard approaching the kirghiz have
been building a lopazik we will tear it
down where are my riders let me see
their steel good good you sons of dogs
norbo threw back his head and bayed
the shouting was taken up along the line
that began to fall in at the summit of the
knoll norbo hurried off to put himself
at the head of his clan

  where is zebek dortshi barked
ubaka i will put a blade down his
lying throat

  master of the horde spoke up a man
on foot who had been one of the first to run
back through the ford i went with
zebek dortshi into the forest few were
with him he met a lama and two kirghiz
khans and spoke with them while his fol-
lowers were cut down then we heard the
trumpet blown and the kirghiz were angry
one of them shot at zebek dortshi i
ran away-because i saw that he had be-
trayed us o khan

  the man eyed ubakas broad blade
fearfully

  lord zebek dortshi when he knew that
he was to be slain put his back against a

adventure

tree and smote down several who came
against him

  the jackal died like a lion grunted the
khan suddenly he knocked the fugitive
sprawling with the flat of his sword

  let no tatar run from an enemy this
day my son spoke a true word by the
name of natagai alashan sent us a true
warning he is the son of my loins we
will charge the kirghiz

  the old man was drunk with pride and
fury but billings laid his hand on the
arm of the khan he pointed to where
masses of the black hats were deploying
from the valleys along a three-mile front
facing them and on the ridge itself the
tatar horsemen were suffering from the
heavy musket fire soon the cannon would
be shotted for a second discharge

  you would be an ox in truth he said
angrily to move forward into this trap
let the kirghiz cross the river and hold this
ridge meanwhile they have fifteen thou-
sand musket men and lancers and you have
not two thousand armed men here look
at those cannon

  the eyes of the khan glowed red then
he quieted and gazed long across the river
where the unfortunate clan was being cut
down he paid no further attention to
billings

  nor did the massacre of the red camel
clan and the plight of the tatars on the
farther bank hold his gaze which sought out
only his fighting men he tugged at his
mustache while the bullets began to whistle
over the heads of those who were listening
for his orders

  for that word he said under his
breath you are a free man captain
billings kai-it is so

  whereupon ubaka khan did a thing that
amazed billings he ordered all the tatar
cavalry to retreat at once to the steppe

      if the stout shade of starshim
      mitrassof could have looked down

       from the everlasting quarters of the
faithful cossacks in the sky and seen what
came to pass on the steppe no doubt the
old colonel would have slapped his ribs and
chuckled with glee

 it was not a battle such as european
marshals fought it was the final desper-
ate struggle of a multitude for life against
a pack that lusted to take life and with life
spoil for the kirghiz had achieved the

first slaying they had reddened their
swords in the bodies of the doomed clan of
zebek dortshi and nuralin khan himself
had stripped the body of zebek dortshi who
had once been the hero of the horde

  and the black kirghiz lfke wolves de-
layed to torture briefly the bodies of the
older tatars with the children-to violate
the younger women who had been caught
on the kara-su or to snarl over booty loose
under their hands then they moved for-
ward into the steppe and behind them
came the jackals the nimble tribesmen of
the kara-bagh tajiks sarts and robbers
generally who had held off until then to see
which side would win the opening skirmish

  by retreating at once into the plain
ubaka khan if he had been leading euro-
pean troops would have thrown his regi-
ments into disorder turned soldiers into
fugitives and laid his supply train open to
attack

  but he had no supply train every man
carried what food there was under his
saddle and every tatar knew how to
handle himself in a feigned rout two
miles back on the waste of clay what had
seemed a disordered mob of men became a
gathering of armed clans dust-grimed and
grim and with weapons ready

  also they were beyond range of the
kirghiz cannon and out of the net that had
been thrown around the bend in the
kara-su the delay of the kirghiz in
crossing the river had enabled ubaka khan
to form into clans some eight thousand
riders to oppose to nearly twice that number
of pursuers

  windless clouds of dust revealed that
camels cattle women and children were
seeking concealment in the loess gullies or
riding to distant springs or climbing to
mesas where they could rest and watch the
smoke puffs that marked the line of battle
strings of riders were hastening to the
menaced quarter of the horde

  they are like bees when you break into
the hive said billings to himself or
beavers coming to a hole in the dam
but the charges of those black hats must
cut them up before they have formed

  the rattle of muskets began again and
the dust stayed in the air billings began
to perceive that the tatars were not holding
their ground nor were they being cut to
pieces as he feared the clans fought
separately drawing the kirghiz on and
the road of the giants



turning upon them fiercely with arrows and
sabers

  the flintlocks of the tatars except those
belonging to the bear clan and the veteran
infantry of the turkish war were handed to
striplings younger than alashan and to
grandfathers whose hands trembled but
whose sight was keen

  these held the tops of clay buttes and
the sides of dried watercourses taking cover
behind the scrub that covered the breast of
the kangar here and there in the groups
he saw young girls with bows they had
small sharp knives thrust through their
belts to use on themselves if the kirghiz
should take them

  no one paid any attention to him as
a precaution he had discarded his cossack
hat and coat he sought for the yurt of
loosang until he sighted it standing apart
as usual there were no disciples in
evidence this time

  drawing his sword billings made his
way through the curtains he saw the bed
of loosang and on it a tall figure with a
hideous face

  turned into an image again by gad he
muttered gazing down into the mask
cant be too sure though on my word

  so he thrust his blade into the effigy of
clothes and wool and found that it was in
fact not loosang the lama had disap-
peared sheathing his sword billings wan-
dered to a height where he could make use
of his telescope he wanted to find norbo
or ubaka

  all he could see were countless bands of
horsemen visible when they topped some
rise in the plain and separating into couples
above whom steel flashed in the sun when
they came together here and there men
were sitting on the ground looking for all
the world like shrubs stricken horses
were stretched in front of him as far as the
horizon already clouds of vultures were
gathering against the blue curtain of the sky

  the sun scorched the back of his neck and
the hot sand under him warmed his blood
captain billings nodded once or twice and
surrendered to drowsiness having been
without sleep for two days ana nights

a horse galloping over him
mui awakened billings he found he
was shivering a cold breath was
upon the surface of the steppe indicating
that the middle of the night was passed

instead of the sun a huge orange moon
shone down on the carpet of white sand
etching sharply the shadows of the bushes

  billings staggered to his feet and looked
around the horse had halted in a hollow
behind him where the red glow of a fire
revealed a ring of faces the wind brought
to his nostrils the smell of burning flesh
this set every fiber of him to clamoring
for food

  reconnoitering the fire cautiously bil-
lings made out that the men were tatars-
of the wolf clan by their belts they had
cut up the hind quarters of a horse and were
roasting the meat over the embers hardly
scorching it before they thrust it into their
mouths and gulped it down

  this time billings did not hesitate to fol-
low their example he swallowed as much
of the smoked meat as he could hold down
and asked for water one of the men
pointed behind him and billings followed a
horse track down a gully at the end of which
in the shadows was a pool of black water

  the sand -around the pool was trampled
and billings had to step over the bodies of
the dead he drank until his thirst was
satisfied judging that dawn was at hand
he moved out on the steppe toward the
nearest height to have a look at his sur-
roundings with the first light he wanted
to get a horse and to find norbo he had
thrown in his lot with the horde and meant
to see the thing through

  it would be a dog trick to ride off the
field now he admitted besides the
show isnt over yet hulloa

  the chills chased up his back he had
been stepping out on the surface of the
mound when what seemed to be a dead man
perched against a boulder extended a hand
that gripped his leg

  look said a tatars voice before
you

  billings looked and made out several
tribesmen squatting in a circle in the
center of the ring was a man on his back
it was norbo almost under the map-
makers feet

  may the way be open before you
norbo observed he cheerfully but then
realized that the master of the herds was-
wounded his chest was wet with a dark
liquid that shone in the moonlight the air
wheezed in his throat so that he could
not speak only his eyes moved toward
billings


adventure

  gently as the maker of maps tried to pull
the hands of norbo from his chest he could
not force the tatars fingers from the
wound to examine it so he sat down to
wait until norbo should speak or day
should come presently the labored breath
of the wounded man was still

  the gate in the sky cried norbo
the gate-it is open

  surprized billings looked up crimson
was streaking the sky in the east and the
wind was freshening a moment later
norbo died

  he had not lived to reach the  but
death had brought to his eyes a vision that
he had sought during the years of his fife
as if the first streaks of dawn had been a
signal muskets cracked and the fighting
was resumed on the steppe

  it was impossible to learn how the battle
was tending the wind stirred up the dust
devils and before full light a canopy of sand
in the air obscured the un while whirling
pillars reached up into the gray vault of the
sky billings wrapped his green neckcloth
about his nose and mouth over his head
he could hear the constant flapping of great
wings

  the heat grew more oppressive

  this is certainly hades thought bil-
lings and if alashan and nadesha have
been slain i shall no doubt meet with them

  whistling to himself he began to work
his way back toward the river determined
to find out what had become of his friends
a horse was sorely needed yet the poor
beasts he met with riderless were foun-
dered

  however joining a party of bear clans-
men who were engaging a similar number of
kirghiz he used his sword with such effect
that the captain of the tatars pointed out a
fresh horse and stopped long enough to
answer billings question as to the battle

  the jackals have left the pack he said
grimly meaning that the outlaw tribes had
deserted the kirghiz so billings judged that
the tatars were more than holding their
own

  he glanced curiously at the cossack dress
of the map-maker

  by the heavens good sir you know how
to use a sword come with us and you
shall see ubaka khan himself who is
seeking out nuralin khan we will duck
that head-of-flame in the waters of the
kara-su where he set a trap for us

  following the noyon billings came out of
a gully into a mob of horsemen tatar and
kirghiz without semblance of rank hacking
and stabbing at each other the whole mass
moving down the slope toward the river

  the charge of the tribesmen had reached
the nucleus of soldiers that nuralin khan
had formed about him during the night and
the kirghiz had given ground before the
whirling attack of the tatars on the
steep clay slope the momentum of the
horses could not be checked billings
beast was caught in the current and in a
trice he was at the edge of the river

  in front of him the kirghiz were swim-
ming their horses across or crowding for the
ford the thirst-tormented animals lin-
gered to drink of the muddy and blood-
stained water neither side had pistols or
muskets in use sq a pause ensued in which
billings made out the figure of nuralin
khan hatless on the farther bank

   stop dog skulker slayer of prisoners-
ubaka khan had heard from captives of
loosangs act in bringing alashan and
nadesha to the river to be killed- stand
and await the ox

  the eyes of the old khan were sunk in his
head and blood dripped from his mouth
billings could not understand how the man
kept going naked to the waist as he was in
the heat that sapped human strength
followed by lines of torguts ubaka
plunged his horse into the river and swam
it across

  nuralin khan looked about him saw his
followers hanging back at the edge of the
thickets and remained where he was to
flee would be dangerous if he could cut
down ubaka it would take the sting out of
the torgut attack and he could then hold
the line of the river

  as ubaka trotted toward him nuralin
raised his red head and cast a lance the
old torgut was watchful and slipped to one
side in the saddle allowing the shaft to
flash past his ribs the belt of nuralin
khan was still filled with an assortment of
weapons for an instant he hesitated which
to draw

 and now a strange thing happened
ubakas sword was in its scabbard seeing
this the red-headed khan took his time
he drew out a long pistol cocked it sighted
and pulled the trigger ubaka was not ten
feet away the onlookers heard the click
of steel striking flint but there was no
the road of the giants



report the plunge across the ford had
dampened the priming in the weapon

  quickly nuralin khan dropped the useless
firearm and his hands darted to knife and
sword hilt at the same time the torgut
chief reached forward and caught the wrists
of his foe pinning them down

  slayer of my son he said slowly
taste what ye have stored up for others

  with the words he leaned toward the
kirghiz putting the whole of his strength
into his grip the face of nuralin khan
grew redder slowly once he spat into the
eyes of ubaka but the old torgut had no
need to see what was to be done the
muscles behind each shoulder blade stood
out in cords down to his belt his head
sank as his shoulders stiffened

  billings saw the hands of nuralin khan
wrenched loose from the weapon hilts
the kirghiz was bent back over the high
crupper of his saddle until his fingers quiv-
ered and his teeth gritted as the wooden
edge cut into the small of his back

  meanwhile he had succeeded in freeing
his feet from the stirrups maddened by
pain he twisted to win free failed and
struck his pony in the neck with a spurred
heel the horse started forward and
ubaka changed his grip

  one of his vise-like hands thrust under
the beard of the kirghiz giant the other
fastened behind the head as the pony
slipped out from under the kirghiz and
the man fell back ubaka gave a wrench

  billings heard two sharp snapping sounds
one of ubakas stirrups had broken under
the strain and the neck of nuralin khan
had broken

  the torgut let the body of his enemy
fall to earth and looked at it a while breath-
ing heavily without drawing a weapon
the khan of the torguts had slain an
experienced fighter heavily armed and
desperate

  to escape the rust of the torguts the
kirghiz who had been awaiting the fate of
their leader fled into the forest as his men
came up ubaka halted them

  find loosang he commanded

  this suited billings exactly and he fol-
lowed the others up the mountain slope
along a track beaten down by the kirghiz
regardless of the fighting still going on to
the right and left the tatars pressed on
the head of ubaka khan nodded as he
rode and the khan from weariness slept in

the saddle but he was alert at any noise

near by

  a sulking tajik pointed out the way that
loosang had taken up one of the gorges
and before long they sighted the blue robe
of a priest fluttering into the bushes ahead
of them with a cry the tatars spurred on

  the bushes gave upon a clearing sur-
rounded on all sides by pines from which
the whole of the kara-su could be seen far
below them here the gylong was cornered
but he was not loosang

  no one paid any attention to him at first
in her bedraggled garments of the temple
nadesha faced them a knife in he small
fist and her brown eyes glowing with
hatred until she caught sight of their
tatar dress and the big bulk of ubaka
khan

  on the ground at her feet lay alashan
one arm was thrown across his eyes as if
to shield them from the sun his right
hand gripped the length of a lamas long
trumpet midway between mouthpiece and
flare

  beside him was stretched the lifeless body
of a gylong the grass of the clearing was
trampled and crushed as if many feet had
stood upon it and moved about

  without a word ubaka khan thrust aside
those in front of him and dismounted bend-
ing over the form of his son nadesha fell
on her knees and attempted to free ala-
shans hand from the horn

  see my lord she said with this
trumpet alashan slew the gylong who lies
here then they struck at him with swords
so that he fell

  tell your story ordered ubaka

  you have heard the tale of captain
beel-ing my lord she looked at the map-
maker and then down at the boy you
know that we were brought here captives
the lama loosang would not entrust me
to any but his own men they told us we
would see the tatar clans surprized at the
fords of the kara-su alashan said no
word to me of what he meant to do

  she pointed down at the river

  here we were stationed under guard of
the lamas when the first clan of the
horde crossed the river the men from
sonkor began to watch eagerly through the
trees those who had alashan between
them also watched one he pushed aside
and from the other he wrested this horn
which sounds a great blast he blew it


adventure

once loudly then again before they cut
him down

  ha

  it made the priests very much afraid
because they believed that nuralin khan
would ride upon them and kill them for per-
mitting the warning to be given so they
ran away into the bushes but nuralin
khan did not come because the fighting
began almost at once i waited here
keeping the sun from alashan who is
sorely hurt

  then for the first time ubaka khans
hand felt of the chest of the boy and his
fingeri were thrust into the cuts to learn
how deep they might be under the rude
touch alashan writhed and opened his
eyes

  build you a horse litter the khan com-
manded his followers and see that he is
taken to my tent tell the women to dress
his wounds for they are deep and half the
blood is out of his body but he will not
die for he is strong-strong

  ubaka rose and he held his chin high
then the tatar nobles spoke the words for
which he was listening

  the boy is a man in all things they
said one after the other he is wise be-
cause he saw the trick that we did not see
   alone- he went among our enemies
   they could not kill him   he is
a khan

  ahatou-alashan they repeated

  even as they spoke a blue-clad figure
crept from among the tatars and began
kissing the boots of ubaka khan it was
the gylong and his face was quivering with a
fearful eagerness

  oh mighty khan ruler of unexampled
benovelence-fortunate father of such a son
-spare my life you follow loosang and
i saw where he went it was that way

  the priest pointed into the pines
ubaka looked at him a moment in silence
suddenly he stooped caught up the bronze
horn in one hand lifting it above his
head the khan brought down the heavy end
on the crown of the gylong

  the skull of the traitor was crushed
inward ubaka hurled the trumpet into
the bushes and strode toward his horse
the sight of his son had driven all thought
of loosang for the moment from his mind

  the men have called him khan he
repeated to himself so he shall ride
with me

  down below them the firing had died out
at last and the tatars were in possession of
the river but billings had not forgotten
the lama he had noted carefully the
direction the gylong had pointed out and
now turned to see how alashan was faring
to his surprize the eyes of the boy were
fastened on him he beckoned billings
nearer

  my father has called me a man he
whispered i give you thanks and honor
for your ride to the horde with the word of
peril and when my wounds are healed
you and i will cross swords until one
of us lies on the ground i have sworn
it

  his glance strayed to nadesha

  billings started to laugh and then grew
thoughtful he explained to the boy that
although he liked nadesha immensely he
did not woo her and that nadesha herself
loved only the son of the khan but
alashan shook his head

  she has made you her anda and
henceforth her life must belong to one
of us only the swords will point the
way

  by now the litter of boughs was finished
and alashan was placed on it the move-
ment rendered him unconscious as the
tatars were slinging the litter between two
ponies billings who had been standing in a
brown study glanced at the boy but per-
ceiving that he was beyond reach of words
turned to nadesha

  i am not going to fight alashan he
said in russian after all this there is a
way out i am leaving the horde ubaka
has said that i am no longer a prisoner
he pointed to the unconscious boy see
the son of the khan wears your girdle
nadesha

  for an instant her brown eyes dwelled in
his and she held out a slim hand

  may the way be open before you my
brother

  but even as she spoke she hurried after
the litter scolding the men for shaking the
boughs and urging them to ride carefully
billings thought briefly of his belongings-
if they still existed-somewhere in the
horde and of horses supplies necessary for
his hazardous trip back along the road of
the torguts

  ubaka however was out of sight and
there was something billings planned to do
that would not wait
the road of the giants



     an hour later billings had
reached the edge of a ravine where
the boles of the great hemlocks were
close together and their branches formed a
roof that made the light dim for some
time he had followed a faint track that had
now lost itself among the rocks down the
steep bottom of the gorge a stream rushed
and roared in a series of falls

  scanning his surroundings carefully bil-
lings strained his ears for any sound that
might lead him to what he sought the
cnly movement he detected was that of
some kind of a panther on a ledge under
him he could see the hide through a
nest of rocks and once he looked into its
muzzle raised toward him

  for a while he studied what he could see
of the thing and then smiled broadly

  gad twill bear closer scrutiny

  he tightened his sash and drew his
rapier laying the scabbard aside sliding
and lowering himself over the boulders he
made his way down to the ledge beside the
fall of the stream

  he was within arms reach before the hide
slipped off the back of the false panther
and loosang rose to his feet pulling off his
mask as he did so for a moment the two
regarded each other

  the lama was half-naked the scars
prominent on his tall frame over his
waist hung an apron of skin but his hands
were empty

  i have no weapon he said slowly
come captain billings we have no
quarrel you and i you are a giaour-i a
priest we are wiser than the tatars
instead of fighting we can share wealth
together

  as billings did not answer he went on
quickly

  you do not believe me but it is so
i have taken gold and silver coins enough
from the tatars to make you a rich land-
owner with serfs

  i do not doubt it but now we are
going to fight-you and i-with our hands
if you have no weapon

  loosangs lined face puckered billings
never took his eyes from the lamas

  captain billings you are not a fool-
although some would call you so each
week on the road of the horde i buried a
large bag of russian money-an officials
salary each time-under the stones of the
shrines that were built where my yurt

stood i can retrace the course of the
tatars

  the lama broke off his lips tightening
he had forgotten as he spoke the map that
billings had made his hands fell to his

sides

  you see i am telling the truth and
you have seen the power of the sonkor
lamasery sweat glistened on his bald
forehead but his eyes were bold if i re-
turn there safe i can turn the tables on my
enemies it would be worth a fortune to
you-and escort back to russia

  i dont think you have any second to
serve in this duel interrupted billings
coldly unless you wish to call in your
friend the devil and we can dispense with
a surgeon	

  for the first time loosang laughed

  ekh after all you are a fool do you
not know yet that steel can not hurt a lama
what will you fight me with that
sword-

  with the words loosang cast himself at
billings his hand darted under his apron
and flew up again in each fist was clasped
a long knife lifting these over his head
he leaped

  and billings leaning forward thrust his
sword through the body of loosang under
the heart

  as he made the thrust he drew to one
side catching the lamas right wrist in his
left and avoiding the downward sweep of
the other arm for a space he held the
form of the priest passive while loosang
squealed between set teeth then he drew
out his blade pushing the body clear of it
over the ledge into the rush of the falls

  he caftght only one slimpse of brown
limbs flashing down through green water
but presently over his head he heard men
calling and the scrape of boots on the
rocks

  billings position on the side of the stream
was bad if he was to be attacked so he
climbed up the slope as best he could and
came out within a detachment of riders who
clustered about his empty scabbard

  they were tribesmen unknown to him
there were a round dozen of them and he
judged they had been raiding because they
had with them several led horses one a
beautiful kochlani mare the other two
beasts were loaded with skins silver orna-
ments and a large simitar splendidly
etched with gold


adventure

  one of them their leader apparently
held gingerly what seemed to be a roll of
paper billings surveyed them until the
headman dismounted and knelt holding
up the roll of paper

  billings lord he said in guttural
tatar we are ten and two men of the
yeka zukor clan that was overcome in
russia and led back to the volga our
hearts inclined toward our kin so ubaka
khan this day commanded us to seek you
out and serve you under pain of having our
limbs pulled from our bodies by horses
we will go back with you to the volga
he laid down the object he held in his
hands with a good deal of relief

  here lord is the map you made of our
road here- he pointed-is a sword of
honor from ubaka and a horse and other
things also your magic things for looking
at the stars we are ready say the
word and mount and go

  billings laughed

 mount-and come

  half-way down the mountain they halted
to look out over the plain the long lines
had formed again among the clans the
dust rose over the camel caravans he
could see the sun reflected on the muskets
as the riders took up their journey to the
east and the valley of the ili he could
almost hear the hoa-hoa of the drivers the
shuffling of the cattle and the creaking of
the wagons

  so it happened that captain billings
watched the passing of the torguts along
the road that led to the ili no other
giaour set eyes on them again but it is
written in the annals of keun-lung that those
of the clans that survived the journey gained
lands and peace in the valley of the ili

  after sheathing his sword billings rode on
toward the setting sun but the tatar at his
side had seen blood stains on the steel blade

  has my lord slain an enemy in the
gorge he asked with interest

  billings smiled

  i cut off the head of a snake

rbn the spring of  when this
j if j tale begins there was no law be-
 i yond the pecos river which cuts
across texas and new mexico

  in that wild land west of the llano
estacado a few big cattlemen held sway
in very much the same manner as the

rude old barons who gave europe a hard
name during the middle ages they raided
one anothers herds and when they wanted
to get rid of an enemy they ordered him
slain to their banners upraised in wars
for range flocked men who had been out-
lawed in older communities for deeds of

blood occasionally a band of these killers
roved through the country making alliances
with cowmen who happened to need more
stock or wanted to get rid of rivals

  of those who believed in the law there
were a few and in lincoln county new
mexico they had succeeded in electing their
candidate for sheriff

  pat garret was his name a former buf-
falo-hunter from the staked plains but
when he took the office he found himself
unable to raise a posse against the most
notorious of the desperadoes upon whose
head the governor of the territory of new
mexico had set a price

  then on a raw day in the early spring
this outlaw whom men called billy the kid
rode down from the mescallero mountains
to talk business with the cattle king of
tularosa

  in the home ranch-house at three rivers
the ruddy-faced old irishman whose herds
ranged over two hundred miles of arid flats
and pine-clad peaks received the beardless
yoyth who carried a thousand dollars and
the blood of eighteen dead men on his head
and after supper was over they sat at the
oilcloth-covered table with a bottle of
whisky between them while the scotch
couple who did the work about the place
sat by and listened to their dickering

  now and again pat coghlin passed the
bottle and bade his visitor fill up always
he filled his own glass to the brim and drank
its contents at a gulp

  red liquor never hurt no one he de-
clared

  he was a fine big man and his voice
boomed as he made the statement the
outlaws buck teeth gleamed in a good-
natured smile of acquiescence but he con-
tented himself with stingy thimblefuls
having to attend to his own killings and
guard his own person he found it prudent
in those days of the quick draw to observe
the asceticism to which his more prosperous
host was never forced he slouched in his
chair lank-haired more than a trifle ragged
as negligently graceful as a cat his voice
came in thin high contrast to the bass of the
thick-chested cattle king as he went on to
tell of the projcct which had brought him
here

  big young steers he said and theyll
be hog fat when the grass comes

  beefs going down this spring pat
coghlin announced and them cowmen of

the canadian is - on looking after

strays

  so they had it back and forth while
george nesbeth the scotch caretaker
rested after the days work and his wife
finished the supper dishes such deals were
very common in those times and the cattle
king of tularosa was a power from las
cruces clear to santa fe the outlaw was
accustomed to riding unchallenged where he
willed they knew no reason why they should
lower their voices

  in the end they came to an agreement
the cowman was to buy all the panhandle
steers which his guest could deliver within
the limits of his far-flung dominions from
portales lake at the breaks of llano
estacado where the drifting herds of the
canadian found refuge during winter
storms to the military post at fort stanton
where pat coghlin sold beef by contract
to the government was a long way farther
than the most vengeful of owners had dared
to follow rustlers in the lawless land west
of the pecos it looked like a good bargain
for the cattle king as for billy the kid
why it took money to play monte and buy
cartridges so both men went to bed well
satisfied

a year went by elsewhere the
story has been told how the cow-
men of the panhandle sent a dozen
young warriors on thfe trail of the herd
which the outlaw had rounded up at
portales lake and how half the band joined
forces with sheriff pat garret to hunt down
the thieves	

  it was in december when they captured
billy the kid at stinking springs after slay-
ing two of his companions now in early
march he was lying in jail under sentence
of death for an old killing and by the irony
of fate the cattle king of tularosa was off
chasing rustlers who had dared to pillage
his own herds when three of those warriors
of the canadian rode up from the roaring
young mining town of white oaks into the
nest of mountains where fort stanton lies

  ever since their comrades had departed
on the man-hunt with pat garret they had
been seeking tidings of the lost herd in
white oaks they had got a hint which
pointed toward the military reservation
on just such a raw day as that on which
the desperado had ridden down to drive his
bargain at the three rivers ranch-house
o

adventure

they reined up their ponies on the parade
ground on the fence before them hung a
row of green hides they read the brands of
their employers on them

southwest of tularosa the river bisecting the
map is the pecos

  now two of the trio returned to white
oaks and charley siringo the wagon boss
rode on alone into the country where pat
coghlin ruled lik an old feudal baron
from the tangle of summits he came down
to the warmer low lands where the stock
was wandering

  now and again he paused to read the
brands in a bunch or turned aside to seek
out a band which had wandered into some
foot-hill canon so he came on stopping
where night found him making himself at
home with such hosts as gave him shelter
once a fandango held him for two days in
a hamlet of mexican adobes and once he
dallied with a pair of hard-eyed rustlers who
offered him good pickings if he would throw
in with them in their next venture it is
not likely that either the dark-skinned
vaqueros with whom he gossiped while the
guitars were strumming or the cow thieves
whom his lean fitness had intrigued into
seeking his alliance noticed how he asked
three questions where he answered one for
he owned a ready camaraderie which dis-
armed all suspicions

  by the time he reached tularosa he had
gathered much information concerning the

methods of the cattle king here they
told him of pat coghlins expedition and
if the news of that man-hunt aroused any
amusement within him after what he had
learned he showed no sign of it

  the op man done struck off toward the
rio grande they said likes not youll
find him over at las cruces

  so he took the trail across the white
sands desert and traveled through the
ghastly dunes where savage men had plied
the trade of murder from the days of the
first spanish settlements he passed the
organ mountains and crossed the lower
reaches of the journado del muerto where
nature in an ugly mood had slain her
victims with greater wantonness than the
renegades who lurked among the pallid
hills in las cruces he met the cattle king
of tularosa returning from a bootless chase
and revealed to him his errand

  the balance of the boys he said are
in white oaks we aim to round up those
steers and make the drive back to the
canadian as early as we can

  if he had come for war his manner did
not show it pat coghlin led the way to the
nearest bar where he downed his drink and
wiped his coarse lips with the back of his
hand

  if you boys go to cutting my herds now
before the grass comes he said its

plumb sure to raise-- with em

  they talked the matter over and he gave
his promise to butcher no more panhandle
steers if the warriors of the canadian would
withhold operations until april

  such transactions were common enough
in a day when most of the big cowmen
bought openly from rustlers if the visitor
came to you well organized it was cheaper
to let him recover his property than to
show fight you charged the salvaged ani-
mals to profit and loss and let it go at that
so charley siringo saw no reason to ques-
tion the good faith of the big irishman

  he rode away from las cruces and back
across the white sands in three rivers
he stopped overnight at the home ranch
and mrs nesbeth cooked his supper after
the meal he sat talking with her and her
husband billy the kids name was spoken
more often than that of any man in new
mexico at the time so it was natural enough
that it should be mentioned by the guest

  news traveled slowly then the scotch
couple knew nothing of the circumstances
the law-bringers



surrounding the outlaws capture when
siringo told them how the kids downfall
was due to those stolen cattle they looked
at each other in meaning silence then
their eyes went to their guest and the free-
masonry which exists among honest people
when they are in a minority loosened their
tongues they told him of the bargain
which they had overheard in this room a
year before

  the wagon boss departed for white oaks
the next morning he had traveled for
some hours and was well up in the moun-
tains when he learned more concerning the
methods of the cattle king of tularosa

  where the trail described a long loop on
the flank of snow-clad peak he left it to take
a short cut the snow was hard as ice on
the steep side-hill he was watching the
ground closely lest his horse should make a
misstep when the animal went down in a
heap and he heard the flat report of a win-
chester above him a second shot sounded
just as he was leaving the saddle

  he fell over a low shelf of rock and lay
there with his revolver in his hand while
the two mexicans who had been sent to kill
him peeped over a clump of brush finally
they rose and went across the ridge it was
evident that they believed they had got him
he allowed them to depart under that im-
pression and made his own way back to
white oaks where a letter from the nes-
beths reached him a few days later telling
him that pat coghlin was continuing to
butcher the panhandle cattle

  all of these facts charley siringo wrote
to bill moore the manager of the l x
outfit and when the tidings reached tascosa
the cattlemen of the canadian held a con-
ference it was plain to see that so long
this sort of thing continued in new mexico
they might send forth their fighting men
every winter but every spring would find
a fresh crop of rustlers to replace those
whom the warriors had exterminated they
decided that it wis time to bring the law
west of thepecos river

  so it came that april saw another horse-
man riding alone through the wild dominions
of the cattle king of tularosa on foot
or in the saddle he made a splendid figure
for he was well over six feet in height broad-
shouldered straight as a young pine-tree
and if you looked into his blue eyes you
knew that once he started for a goal he
meant to reach it

f a kentuckian by birth and a texan by
right of experience his name was john w
poe during the early seventies when the
great bison herds used to roam the llano
estacado and the comanche war-parties
were abroad during every light moon the
buffalo-hunters knew him as one to whom
it was no feat of marksmanship to break a
bulls neck at six hundred yards in fort
griffins palmy days he impressed his per-
sonality upon the populace by disarming
jim oglesby a noted bad-man from the
indian territory with his bare hands

  the people chose him for town marshal
in  and he enhanced his prestige by
many deeds of quiet boldness one wild
night when it looked as if the power of the
statutes was broken in the frontier town he
stood alone between a mob which filled the
main street and his prisoner whom they had
come to lynch his eyes were serene with
faith as he told them that although they
might kill him the law would still remain
to exact justice before his calm inflexibility
the armed crowd wavered and melted away

  he came to mobeetie on the canadian in
 and the reputation born of these
exploits followed him he lived up to it in
the panhandle metropolis and so the cattle-
men picked him to carry the law in which
he placed so deep a faith into this country
to the west where men were making mock
of it

  for a large man he was remarkably un-
obtrusive he owned a reticence which
effaced him from others notice like one of
those magic robes in the arabian nights
whose wearers were invisible and when
he came to white oaks he made the journey
by way of dodge city and the railroad en-
tering the lawless young mining town as it
were by the back door wherefore it hap-
pened that none of pat coghlins henchmen
knew of his presence

  there were many of these hardly a week
went by but one of them slipped through
the night to meet the cattle king of
tularosa under a certain big cottonwood-
tree in front of the ranch house and report
what he had seen-or done-out in the
mountains or the pallid sand-hills but
none of them brought tidings of john w
poe

  of the lawoving men who lived beyond
the pecos there were a few who knew some-
thing of his comings and goings sheriff
pat garret met him in more than one quiet


adventure

conference the officer in charge of the
military post at fort stanton talked with
him george nesbeth and his wife told him
their story under the cattle kings nose in
three rivers in las cruces he showed
his data to a j fountain the lawyer whom
he had retained to help prosecute pat
coghlin these and one or two others
who were in the secret were beginning to
pluck up heart and to hope for a day when
the big cattle-thieves would respect the
rights of property and the outlaws would
take to cover

  by this time the warriors of the canadian
had gathered the survivors of that stolen
herd from pat coghlins ranges and were
driving them up the pecos valley poe had
rounded up enough facts to convince the
most timid of grand juries of the cattle
kings part in the conspiracy in fifteen
days more the hangman would meet billy
the kid at the gallows steps that was the
propitious state of affairs on the twenty-
eighth day of april when something hap-
pened which changed all plans and dashed
high hopes

that morning sheriff pat garret
left lincoln to confer with john w
poe in white oaks regarding the
case against pat coghlin before he de-
parted from the county seat he went to the
two-story adobe building which had been
murphy  dolans store during the lincoln
county war days and was now being used
as the court-house he entered the room
on the upper floor where billy the kid was
lying with irons on his wrists and ankles
and two jailors watching him the prisoner
looked up and if the nearness of that day
when he would meet the hangman was on
his mind he did not show it his smile was
care-free

  hello pat said he

  the sheriff regarded him from beneath
drooping eyelids

  howdy kid he answered in his
habitual undertone then turning to bob
ollinger who was on guard

  bob im going over to white oaks he
announced and while im away- he
made a little gesture to include j w bell
the other jailor who happened to be in the
room at the time- i want you boys to
keep just twice as closea watch as you have
kept before

  bob ollinger laughed grimly ever since

the early days of the lincoln county war he
and the desperado had been bitter enemies
it was one of those blood-born feuds which
blood alone can wipe out

  dont worry pat

  he rose as he was speaking and went to
a closet at the other end of the room he
unlocked the door and turned to face them
with adouble-barreled shotgun in his hand
his eyes were fixed on the prisoner

  theres eighteen buckshot in each of
these barrels and i reckon the man that
catches them will know it

  he patted the weapon and when he was
replacing it the outlaw called his name

  bob better be careful or you might get
those buckshot yourself

  he was smiling as he said it there was
a peculiar quality in that smile of his a
boyish ingenuousness which disarmed sus-
picion but pat garrets lids drooped a
little lower and his lips clamped down
tighter so that they barely let his words
out

  remember boys twice as careful

  he nodded at the prisoner

  so long

  and with that he left them to make his
journey to white oaks

  the guards settled down to the days
monotonous routine which the sheriffs
visit had interrupted bob ollinger re-
sumed his seat facing the cot where his
charge lay shackled hand and foot a good
three yards of floor space separated them
had he been endowed with a keen sense
of the ridiculous the length of that interval
might have struck him as absurd under the
circumstances but he was not a humorous
man nor was he at all imaginative he sat
there in silence regarding billy the kid like
a bulldog who has been set to watch a man

  several cowboys who were awaiting trial
for a shooting scrape were playing cards out
in the hallway at the head of the stairs
occasionally an oath or a burst of laughter
came from the group to break the rooms
stillness ollinger remained immobile in
his armchair the lank-haired youth stole
a glance at him now and then from the cot
and his lips curved showing his big buck
teeth it was as if the sight of his jailer
aroused pleasant speculations

  so the day passed and at five oclock in
the afternoon bell appeared to take his turn
on watch ollinger gave up his armchair
and called to the cowboys
the law-bringers



  all right boys supper-time

  they followed him down the stairs and
across the street to a little-mexican eating-
house jesting after the manner of their care-
free breed he laughed with them and an-
swered their badinage with good-natured
profanity restraint had passed from him
when he left that upper floor room

  bell sat in the armchair watching the
long-haired boy with irons on his limbs who
smiled so easily in the rooms dimness the
face on the cot showed sharp and white
in part that lean pallor came from the long
confinement but starvation had heightened
it during the past few weeks billy the kid
had eaten next to nothing men thought
it was because he had the hangman on his
mind

  theres a las cruces paper came to-
day he said at length i wisht youd
leave me read it

  bell caught the smile which accompanied
the request and his own lips relaxed a trifle
as he rose to get the weekly where the cow-
boys had left it when he returned the
prisoner made no effort to reach for it his
hands were beneath the bedclothes

  one of them punchers was saying some-
thing about a shooting down three rivers
way find that item for me will you i
cant make out to turn the pages with these

-hobbles on me

  the big teeth were revealed by another
of those boyish smiles

   bell hitched his chair a little closer and
when he had unfolded the paper so that its
outspread pages formed a screen between
them billy the kid performed a maneuver 
which he had been practising ever since he
had starved himself to sufficient leanness

if there was any clink of metal the bed-
clothes muffled it the good-natured
deputy was scanning the closely printed
columns for that imaginary item when
some sound or other reached his ears and
he glanced up over the papers top to see
the outlaws eyes looking down into his own
less than a foot away

  bell reached toward his revolver before
the movement was fairly begun the pris-
oners hand now freed from its manacle
had grasped the weapon and plucked it
from the holster

  the chair went over with a crash the
deputy made one futile step toward the
desperado f then turned to flee billy the
kid lowered the barrel of the six-shooter

with a deliberation which allowed the other
to reach the door before he pulled the trig-
ger the air within the close walls shook
before the explosion

  bell staggered out through the doorway
and fell headlong down the stairs he was
dead when he reached the bottom old
geiss the regular jailer was sitting on the
lowest step when the body struck him he
ran into the street shouting the alarm

   when the party in the little eating-house
heard the shot bob ollinger sprang to his
feet and rushed out he saw the jailer com-
ing toward him and heard his shout he
ran on across the roadway then a thin
high voice above his head halted him

   hello bob the voice said

  it came from a window on the second
floor oithe adobe court-house which opened
on a little balcony bob ollinger looked up
the sash was thrown wide he saw the
double-barreled shotgun which had been the
subject of their grim repartee that same
morning slanting down toward him and
behind the gleaming barrels pressed close
beside the stock he saw billy the kids
face the cowboys who were watching
from the eating-house door said afterward
that the outlaw was smiling when he pulled
the trigger the weapon roared and bob
ollinger pitched forward dead

  it took billy the kid two hours to file
his leg shackles for he went at the work
very deliberately there on the little balcony
by the time he had come forth from the
room where he had been lying a prisoner all
these weeks more than a score of well-
armed men were gathered in a tight pack
across the street none of them raised a
hand to stop him two cartridge-belts
swathed his body and two six-shooters
dangled by his hips he kept a winchester
standing beside him

  but these weapons which he had got
from the closet with the shotgun were not
the only menace which was working on that
crowd to keep its members acquiescent
the memory of the lincoln county war
in which the desperado had been the leader
of the losing faction was still fresh here
where some of its hardest battles had been
fought many of the audience were openly
in sympathy with him it would need a
bold man to raise his voice against proceed-
ings and a bolder one to lift a hostile hand

   so when he had released his limbs a man
hurried at his bidding to saddle up a pony


adventure

they all stood by while he mounted and
at his bidding there were some who cheered
him as he rode away

  those were hard days it is a fact that
when the news of his escape reached the
band of canadian warriors who were driving
the recovered cattle up the pecos frank
clifford let out a whoop and jumped into
the river for sheer joy

in white oaks on the day after
the jail-break pat garret was talking
with john w poe over the evidence
which the latter had gathered against the
cattle king of tularosa when a messenger
rode up and told them the news the two
men stood silent until the rider had finished
his bloody story

  ill saddle up and strike out for lincoln
pat garret said in his habitual undertone

  poe nodded they parted without more
words it was no time for talk and if it
had been then gifts did not run in that
direction

  the sheriff returned to the county seat
to take up the outlaws trail and follow it
to the flanks of el capitan peak there
it vanished so completely that the apache
trackers whom he got from the mescallero
agency were unable to find any trace of it

  it was as has been said a hard era and
there were many men in new mexico who
sympathized with the fugitive some of
them genuinely believed that the big cow-
men who had openly allied themselves with
rustlers and professional gunfighters were
the only real culprits some liked the des-
perado because they were themselves of a
lawless breed and there were others who
were profiting directly or indirectly by
cattle-stealing the posses which pat gar-
ret led forth from lincoln traveled through
a land where every other man was either
hostile to the law or afraid to give its officers
a word of information

  so may went by and june and billy the
kid was still at large men spoke his name
in undertones and looked over their shoul-
ders when they uttered it as for the law
they laughed when it was mentioned they
said there was no law beyond the pecos

  in the mean time john w poe kept on
about his business of getting evidence-
against the cattle king of tularosa if he
was disheartened by the turn of events he
did not allow it to interfere with his work
and when he came back to white oaks

one day early in july the witnesses were
listed the warrants were sworn out the
case was complete down to the last little
detail

  he was walking down the mining towns
crowded street that afternoon when an old-
timer by the name of george graham whom
he had known back in the buffalo-hunting
days at fort griffin fell in beside him-one
ox those ardent spirits whom whisky and
faro have bested in many an encounter but
who are always willing to renew the strug-
gle on this day however he was cold
sober

  come on he said as quietly as if their
last meeting had been yesterday instead of
years ago i want to talk to you

  he led the way around the corner and
out along the side street to the fringes of the
town  nor did he stop until they had passed
the last cabin and were in the thick brush

  now graham announced when he had
looked about to make certain that no one
was near by i know your business in this
country and i got something to tell you

  he lowered his voice

  the other night not having room
money i was sleeping in dedrich brothers
livery stable they used to be in business
with the kid those fellows rustling cattle
two years or so ago well id made down
my bed and was lying there in the hay
when i heard three of em talking in the
office thes just a thin board partition and
the words come plain where i was rolled
up in my blankets they was speaking
about the kid hes been near white oaks
twicet lately sneaked in to see them on
some deal or other and right now hes
holed up at fort sumner i thought the
information might-come in handy

  they parted there in the brush and went
back to town by separate ways and on the
next day john w poe journeyed to lincoln

  i know the man he said when he had
repeated the news to pat garret and lies
straight if it wasnt for that i wouldnt
have come for it doesnt so  possible

  the sheriff shook his head

  not a chance in a thousand he de-
clared  but if you say so ill go well pick
up my deputy kip mckinney over in
roswell

  they rode down from lincoln to the
valley of the pecos and talked it over with
mckinney in the hamlet where captain
j c lea had recently platted the site of
the law-bringers



the town which has since grown to one of the
mostprosperous in the southwest like the
other two the deputy was a former texan
and like them he took small stock in the
information he and pat garret had
scouted over the country of the upper pecos
more than once that summer and they had
got no trace whatever of their man

  never find him there he asserted
hes down in mexico thats where he is

  so the three set forth with no faith in the
tidings which had led them on the errand
but though they thought it was a wild-
goose chase they took the precaution of
riding out from roswell in the direction
of the county seat for if that one chance
in a thousand should turn out to have fallen
in their favor they did not propose to let
their purpose be known in a country where
scores of riders were ready to risk their lives
to carry warning to the outlaw

  when they had traveled for some miles
out into the hills they turned from the
lincoln road and struck off to the north-
ward toward the abandoned military post
they avoided the beaten trails they made
detours past every ranch house and sheep-
camp they rode hard-keeping the news
behind them as the saying of those old
days has it

  it was more like the ride of three fugitives
fleeing from justice than three of the laws
officers

  night came they picketed their ponies
and rolled up on the bare ground in their
saddle blankets the next day they pressed
on and when darkness fell it found them
encamped in the sand-hills six miles or so
out of fort sumner

  in the morning they held a conference
pat garret had courted his wife in the
settlement at the abandoned post and there
was not a mexican in that part of the coun-
try but knew him since last winter when
he and the warriors of the canadian
had captured billy the kid a few miles
away

  and me said kip mckinney why
ive been there half a dozen times if i
was to show my nose theyd all know what
was up before id got off my pony

  so it fell to john w poe to ride into
town and find out what he could

  when you get there pat garret told
him go to beaver smiths store most
everybody hangs out there if you dont
find anything you might go on to rudolphs

seven miles out on the las vegas road hes
a friend of mine good man ill give you
a note to him

  if you aint back here by dusk why
theres a double row of cottonwoods runs
out for two miles from the post at the other
side of town well ride over and meet you
at the far end of it

  when poe rode up to old beaver smiths
store that morning there was no one in sight
save the grizzled proprietor who was loung-
ing in the doorway and a couple of mexi-
cans who were devoting themselves assidu-
ously to doing nothing at all by the time
he had dismounted and thrown his ponys
reins over the hitching-rack three or four
white men had appeared from nowhere in
particular

  howdy said beaver smith never was
greeting more noncommittal he looked the
newcomer over from head to foot and then
let his eyes stray down the little street

  there were now half a dozen inhabitants
on their way to the store fort sumner
was waking up beaver smiths eyes came
back to poe

  where you from he queried sharply

  white oaks poe had the answer ready
been prospecting im on my way to the
canadian

  he dallied at the door while the towns
welcoming delegation strayed up and
gathered around him they were hard
citizens one did not need to look at their
revolvers-and every man of them wore a
weapon beside his thigh-to realize that
they nodded to him and when they had
appraised him narrowly-

 which way you coming from one
demanded

  white oaks he said been pros-
pecting

  and where you heading fer another

asked

  he told the story that he had given beaver
smith

  hows the mines panning out the first
questioner cut in

  he gave them the latest news from baxter
mountain it seemed to satisfythem

  come inside and have something they
bade him

  he stood among them before the little
unpainted bar and drank sparingly of the
fervent whisky the while he retailed such
tidings from the lower country as were of
interest and when the talk had become
 

adventure

a little looser he turned the subject in the
direction of his quest

  pat garret was over in white oaks
when i left he told them after the kid
they say hes been down that way lately

  the talk died at once he found himself
the center of a dumb group beaver smith
shuffled back and forth sorting out glasses
there was no other sound poe felt their
eyes searching him

  have another he said and waited while
the tension passed

  more men came in and watched him as
they drank the conversation picked up
again they talked of mines and of the
prospects for feed and other kindred sub-
jects and when something like an hour
had gone by he casually mentioned the out-
laws name once more no one replied
he caught some of them looking sidelong at
one another but most were watching him

  there was no mistaking the suspicion
which had come among them and now
hfc began to feel that there was something
in the information which george graham
had given him

  he loafed about the store for another
hour or so and when the constraint had lifted
he departed for an eating-house where he
got his first real meal since leaving roswell
then he swung into the saddle and rode out
by the road which led off toward the
canadian

  he traveled for some miles for he felt
reasonably certain that if one of those hard-
eyed men with whom he had been drinking
at beaver smiths that morning discovered
him taking a different route from the one
which his story had indicated he might be-
come a target for the man whom he was
seeking when he had gone far enough to
satisfy the most exacting of spies he started
across country for the las vegas road and
made his way to the rudolph place

  it was well along in the afternoon when
he dismounted at the ranch house ru-
dolph met him at the hitching-rack he was
an elderly man and well to do one of the
few in the country who were above sus-
picion of qjliance with the outlaw but the
memory of the mornings ordeal in fort
sumner made poe go slowly now he sat
on the wide porch with his host and they
talked of many things before he mentioned
billy the kid

  ive heard poe said that hes in the
country around fort sumner

  it was as if he had thrust a revolver
muzzle into the mans face rudolph turned
a shade paler his eyes became furtive

  not a show of it he declared vehe-
mently he aint here and aint been
here 

  poe showed him pat garrets note then
and when the other had read it put his cards
on the table

  pat garrets wrong and youre wrong
rudolph told him theres nothing in the
story nothing

  the very emphasis which he put upon it
made the statement sound the more im-
probable and he was in a sweat of fear
nor did he draw a free breath until his
visitor rose to depart then hisjrelief was
so patent that poe rode away more con-
vinced than ever that the outlaw was some-
where close by

 cfc i it was now evening too late for
i  i k to return to the camping-place

       he struck out for the two rows of
cottonwood-trees which pat garret had
mentioned when he left and as he was com-
ing up over a low sand hill to the west he
saw the sheriff and kip mckinney riding
toward him from the east they met as if
it had been timed by clockwork

  poe recounted the days events when
he had finished garret shook his head

  were on a cold trail he said

  but the feeling born of what he had seen
and heard in fort sumner kept poe stub-
born and although kip mckinney like the
sheriff argued that there was no use in going
farther he persisted at last

  i know a house garret said where
the kid used to visit theres a woman
lives there hes took a fancy to if hes in
fort sumner hell mighty likely be at that
house

 they rode down the old abandoned
avenue of cottonwoods and left their horses
near the other end in pre-war days the
government had a navaho school here and
the indians had planted a peach orchard
the trio stole on foot through the straggling
trees vhich had survived the years to a spot
where they could watch the house

  the moon rose they waited here for
three hours but no man came some time
near midnight a mexican slipped out of the
door and passed close by their hiding-place

i dont like the way that greaser acted
pat garret said if hes seen us the whole
the law-bringers



town will know it inside of half an hour
we better pull out

  but poe thought of those hard-eyed men
looking at him in silence in beaver smiths
store and of old man rudolph sweating
with fear clamoring that the outlaw was
not in the country  he sat there thinking
for some moments

  theres pete maxwell he proposed
say we go and see him

  pete maxwell was the richest man in this
end of the pecos valley the son of old
lucien maxwell who gained fame in the
days of the santa fe trail he had come
down here after the abandonment of the
military post to become known as one of
the biggest sheep men in the territory he
and garret were close friends

  if the kids been around fort sumner
poe persisted hell have heard of it we
may as well cover all the ground as long as
were here 

  so as a last resort and more because they
did not like to leave without doing every-
thing that could be done than for any other
reason they went to pete maxwells house

  in the old days of the military post it
had been officers quarters a large two-
story adobe fronting the open space which
had once been a parade ground a paling
fence surrounded it there was a wide ve-
randa on all sides

  it stood silent in the moonlight as the
three men slipped up toward it when
they had passed through the gate garret
pointed to the nearest door

  thats petes room he told them
ill go in and have a talk with him you
fellows wait out here

  after the mexican fashion the rooms all
opened on the veranda the door to which
the sheriff had pointed was the first one
close to the front it was ajar for the night
was warm garret entered without knock-
ing his tall form was swallowed by the inner
darkness

  poe leaned against the paling fence mc-
kinney dropped on one knee tucking that
foot under him cowboy fashion and started
to roll a cigaret both had laid aside their
winchesters they felt able to relax a
vigilance which had kept their hands on
their weapons ever since the beginning of
the evening pete maxwells place was
above suspicion

  and because of that fact the man whom
they were hunting had chosen pete max-

wells place for his refuge during all these
weeks while posses had been scouring the
country for him

  now while the sheriff slipped into the
darkened room and the other two took
their places by the fence to wait billy the
kid lay on his blankets in a little adobe
cabin in the rear of the house listening to
the mexican who had passed the trio in the
old navaho peach orchard those whis-
pered tidings of strangers in fort sumner
aroused him from sleep to catlike quickness

  while he harkened he was drawing on
his clothes he buckled his belt slipped the
revolver in its holster picked up his win-
chester and hurried out unshod to learn
more of the strangers maxwell could tell
him he came straight to the sheepmans
room

  john w poe looked up and saw him ap-
proaching in the moonlight a slight figure
bent forward with haste almost running
he did not dream it was the outlaw whom
he had never seen one would as soon ex-
pect to meet billy the kid in lincoln as in
pete maxwells yard

  the shadow of the house fell on the pair
beside the fence billy the kid almost
stumbled on kip mckinney who was just
finishing rolling his cigaret before he saw
them his rifle was in his right hand he
wore his six-shooter-it was a double-
action forty-one colts-waist high on his
left side a trick of his own and-like the
gun-unique among the warriors of the
border the left hand moved the
weapons muzzle almost touched poes
belly

  quien es in english it is who are
you

  in after years poe said that was the
quickest draw he ever saw and the voice
was vibrant with suspicion and still poe did
not dream whose voice it was the whole
thing-from the time when he first caught
sight of the coatless unshod figure until
the revolver was confronting him-had
lasted perhaps two seconds men drew
their guns too often in those days for one
to attach any suspicion to that action
and this was the one place in fort sumner
where sheriff pat garret was welcome

  thats all right now poe said quietly
no ones going to hurt you

  he had a dim idea it might be one of
pete maxwells sheep-herders

  and billy the kid backed away without


adventure

pulling the trigger in all his career-and
especially since the close of the lincoln
county war when he had become an out-
law-he had been overquick with his trig-
ger-finger shoot first and ask questions
afterward was the rule in that country
and he had always gone the rule one better

  but tonight he forsook his deadly cus-
tom probably it was for the same reason
as that which kept poe from suspecting his
identity-this was pete maxwells place
he could not well afford to kill a man here
until he was sure that his victim was an
enemy

  so he backed away and as he retreated
across the veranda-

  quien es he asked again

  he repeated the question sharply as he
entered the room the last that poe saw
of him was when he stood his rifle on the
threshold

  pat garret was sitting on pete maxwells
bed the room was black dark the figure
of the outlaw flashed past the pool of moon-
light at the door and was swallowed in the
gloom it reached the foot of the bed

  pete who are those fellows

  as the desperado asked the question pat
garrets hand dropped to his revolver-butt
he knew the voice he started to pull the
gun and it stuck it was-so he told john
w poe afterward-a long and lonely mo-
ment that followed

  billy the kid heard the movement and
whirled away from the bed toward the
rooms outer wall

 quien es he demanded	

  he had shifted his revolver to his right
hand he had drawn a butcher-knife in his
left when garrets weapon came free and
the sheriff fired twice

  outside the house poe and mckinney
heard the two shots and the thump of the
outlaws body as it struck the floor then
there was a groan

  garret came forth upon the porch

  thats the kid he said quietly and
i think i got him poe was astounded

   couldnt be he cried youve got the
wrong man pat

  garret shook his head

 id know that voice in a thou-
sand-

  as he was speaking pete maxwell burst
forth upon them poe was throwing down
on him with his winchester when the sheriff
struck the weapons barrel

  dont shoot pete maxwell he cried

  they turned to the panic-stricken sheep-
man he bowed his head

  it was the kid he told them

  and when he brought a lighted lamp they
found the body lying on the floor with the
knife and the revolver in the dead hands
garrets first bullet had found his heart
the second one had struck the wall as he
feil	

      it was nearly a year before they
tried the cattle king of-tularosa
charley siringo rode over from the
panhandle and was stricken with smallpox
while he was traveling across the country
from the pecos but men were accustomed
to harder things than smallpox in those
days and the wagon boss wrapped his face
in a silk handkerchief to keep the spots from
showing other than that he did not let
the disease bother him and he was on hand
to give his evidence when the case was
called so too were the nesbeths the jury
gave their verdict-guilty

  but the law has its limitations the
judge let pat coghlin off with a fine of two
hundred and fifty dollars

  for some years to come such men as
john w poe pat garret and others con-
tinued to carry on the task which the
warriors of the canadian had begun when
garrets term as sheriff ended the people
elected poe to the office by the time he
retired the courts were really beginning t
make their presence felt in the land

  so the law came across the river and only
a few gray-haired men who had lived there
in the wild days when every one made his
own rules of action and enforced them with
forty-five or winchester remember the old
saying of the early eighties-

  there is no law beyond the pecos
catching a tatar

author of the frozen frontier the gladiators etc

he day that the schooner pacific
poll chose to take the law into
her own hands whilst lying at
anchor in the middle of santa
catamaran bay was long hot and windless
the sky was blue above the bay the sea
was blue in the bay the pacific poll was
blue also bright blue and wrhen her captain
aoke suddenly from an afternoon siesta
and glaring overside discovered to his
stupefaction that writh anchor down and
no sail the pacific poll was undoubtedly
under considerable and rapid way he-why
he looked blue too

  now respectable schooners fast at
anchor and with their sails all furled do
not go off out to sea suddenly without vis-
ible means of propulsion and without reason
given as a rule

  that is w-hat alarmed the captain as he
raced for the bow anchor chains calling all
the still afternoon to witness with stentori-
an yells that hastily awoke the crew aboard

  the bow anchor however was fast in the
sea-bed or apparently so the chain was
taut and all correct only there was a
visible ripple about the chain where it
vanished into the water and the ripple was
singing a song all to itself in the amber and
blue afternoon hush and a high tenor note
of lapping waters under the streaked bows
was answering it the ship wtas going
straight and true by herself

  w ere being towed bawled the mate
the ships bein towed by her own blame
anchor dyer ever see

  is that all replied the captain weakly
mopping his head where he leaned against
the anchor capstan  i thought twas that
new whisky you brought aboard last night
dont mind me go right along any other
little miracle yed like to announce

  none said the mate sarcastically
unless yed care to spend the night at sea
or under it for theres where were heading
at the rate o knots at present thats all
i wish to observe	

  but it was not all

  the various craft lying picturesquely
about in santa catamaran bay awoke to
great surprize at the sight of one fine blue
schooner towed by its own anchor sliding
rapidly past them out to sea

  pulling on the anchor chain was no good
they tried that and it only had the effect
of increasing the speed of the mad ship

  men said that by the quiver the chain
had the feel as of the anchor being alive
on the other end of that chain

  if we go on like this we shall make the
doldrums by nightfall remarked the
mate cheerfully

  the skippers answer was neither cheerful
nor common or garden for the doldrums
is a place some eight miles off-shore where
the sea is like smoked glass and all the
winds are dead if a ship a sailing ship
gets becalmed in the doldrums she may
as well send for food and start market-
gardening or hire herself out as a fishing
resort shell be there some time

  and the mate was right straight as the
o

adventure

homing bee heads for the hive that anchor
possessed of devils headed for  those darned
doldrums and there in the very middle
just where the air was most utterly still the
sea most glassy it stopped

  for the first time in his life the captain
was dumb his fist dropped his eyes bulged
his cap lifted his lips moved convulsively
as if he were trying to speak but no words
came from them and the mate the black
cookand all the crew ran to him and peered
overside

  it was the loquacious mate who broke
the stupefied silence that followed

  its coming back he yelled heavens
above its coming back to sleep

  it was the anchor chain was no longer
taut but was returning to the ships side
presumably the anchor pulling it

  next moment every man aboard felt and
saw the chain shake shake as the chain on
a dogs collar shakes when its owner gets
a wetting and shakes himself dry then-
then with a groan with eyes that popped
with pupils that started they saw

  deep down through that ineffable blue
sea that was as clear as crystal they saw
flying along-there is no other word for it-
over the dazzling white of the sandy sea-
floor a gigantic flat fish-not a flat-fish
he was two feet seven inches thick twenty-
one and a half feet in width including his
long side-fins that were more like great
wings and were themselves five feet and a
half long his mouth was two feet ten inches
wide between the eyes which were on the
top of himself-five feet and a half he was
eleven feet ten inches long not counting his
tail which was six feet eight inches and the
weight of him was morethan one ton seven
hundred pounds

  if that is not enough you have the fact
that close to his mouth he had things-
claspers they call em-most suggestive
armlike things about three feet long quite
evidently put there for the purpose of
helping him to feed that demure mouth of
his he was all shining black jet above and
all spotless dazzling white below the fron-
tier between the two being lined off as with
a ruler

  he flew over those spotless sands through
the blue depths with a grace incomparable
a superb slow mastery of power that was the
very incarnation of the poetry of motion
something weird there was about him too
weird uncanny and unreal

  no wonder those men of the sea peering
down wide-eyed at him there as he came
flying toward them as if he were some tre-
mendous bat out of a nightmare sucked in
their united breaths and were dumb they
were english they did not know those
waters and they had no wish to investigate
further one look was enough

  they could believe anything now even
that that fish had run into their anchor-
chain in santa catamaran bay and find-
ing that something appeared to be wishful
of detaining him had picked it up in his
claspers and calmly proceeded out to sea
chain anchor pacific poll and all now
he had turned about and shaken the anchor
loose and having so to speak cast off his
tow was proceeding always with the same
wonderful grace back under the ship to
resume his lawful occasions

  then the crew of the pacific poll rubbed
their eyes and language failing even them
gasped as well they might for they had
beheld a full-grown full-blown specimen
of the monster manta the giant ray the
ocean bat alias devil of the sea-king of all
the rays and skates

  very many and amazing star turns had
those teeming ocean depths but none so
mysteriously unique as the leviathan manta
the devil of the deep

j	the dusk came stealing over the

       sea somewhere inshore rose a roar
esss iike pounding of a tremendous
storm sea upon a tormented beach it was
no storm however as the crew of the pacific
poll thought but the diabolical in-drive of
thousands of salt-water jacks-the crevalle
of the natives a fierce and four-foot fish-
forcing before them in their horrible slaugh-
ter-frenzy hapless shoals of anchovies on to
the beach

  the huge manta as he swept along rising
occasionally to the surface at the end of each
beautiful switchback curve of progress
could see them and presently he was
among the outer edge of that maelstrom of
carnage where the big four-footers were
charging into the packed mass of anchovies
killing and maiming with such mad fury
that they shot far up on to the sands there
to lie and roll gasping and struggling in
dozens

  then the manta sank volplaned down
spread-eagled sinking gradually with in-
comparable grace like some floating cloud
catching a tatar



there to lie motionless among the coral and
seaweeds of every fantastic brilliant shape
and hue till night swept on and all the sea
lighted up afire with flaming phosphor-
escence

  the jack drew off with the dark leaving
the shore-line dyed with blood and present-
ly a host of small pale ghostly crawling
shapes each carrying a row of subdued
lamps spread themselves over the spotless
white floor of the shallows

  these were crayfish at feed and for them
the monster ray had risked his bulk with
scarce enough water under his ponderous
white belly

  nor was he alone here as the darkness
deepened weird forms whirling through the
gloom or leaping with reports like cannon-
fire marked where other rays the handsome
spotted eagle of the seas were also at feed

  once the manta himself leaped high a
mighty irruption of fiery cascades to fall
back flat with a crashing reverberation that
ran across the deep and was answered in
echoes for miles

  once shining dully with a faint and sinis-
ter gleam he all but settled upon and for
all i know might have smothered and eaten
an unspeakable twelve-foot octopus who
however instantly dyed that wofiderful
illuminated garden of the seas with a cov-
ering cloud of its own ink and escaped
with horrible writhings of fear in the re-
sulting confusion

  then a strange thing happened in the
gloom an immense black bulk appeared for
a moment turned half over up-reared like
the wing of some stupendous bird and still
going at high speed sank again noiselessly
turning magically into a dazzling ghost of
white as it did so

  it was followed by another on the same
curving course as the first breaking the
surface and rearing up one tremendous
wing and sinking again in a glare of
white also at the same place

  a third took up the game a fourth fol-
lowed gleams of phosphorescence showed
yet more enormous bulks on the move in
the heart of the dim depths-all following
one another round and round upon a huge
circle rising at times to cant on their sides
at the turn and sink noiselessly as phantom
giant bats from a prehistoric dream-world
it was the fire-dance of a school of the
sea-devils the giant rays a sight few human
eyes are privileged to see

  

  in five minutes our manta who had lain
all this time flat as a rock-slab upon the
sands watching with his cold glassy eyes
joined in the dance swinging into place
with inimitable grace and following the
next ahead round and round the magic
circle which gradually shifted its center
farther and farther out to sea times he
sprang as the others sprang headlong aloft
to come down in a cascade of fire with the
biggest things in flops perhaps in all
nature

  and from the shore men staring out
heard the thunder of the leaping manta
and saw the flashes of their fall like the
thunder and the flash of guns and said that
the sea-devils were at their wedding-dance
and made ready

  dawn found the monumental manta still
superbly sweeping round and round with
his fellows at times he showed as a great
wing uplifted heaved over and dived
at other times he was far down under in the
wonderful sapphire hanging gardens of the
sea appearing only as some mountainous
bubble shape flying along always with his
wonderful effortless grace

  and the gasoline launch stealing behind
the first stabbing swords of the rising sun
was unseen by him-unseen by all

  perhaps it may be that this the wonder-
ful the mystic dance of the giant devil-rays
is their marriage festival who can tell
who dare say only this i comprehend
that whereas our manta the special giant
with whom we are concerned began that
night in splendid isolation he did not end
it so another ray swam close to him and
with him only and she be it noted was-
if one may use the expression with regard
to wooers a ton and more in weight-an
eligible flapper

  very nearly however she flapped once
too often for being possibly too much occu-
pied in giving attention to our manta and
not keeping her eyes all round her head at
hice she so nearly ran into the launch as
she rose to the surface at last that it all but
tilted over in her stupendous and alarmed
wash

  there was viewed from below some sud-
den wild disturbance upon the great golden
white circle that represented the surface
our manta beheld it knew perhaps its
meaning or some of the same and acted

  he flew still wondrous in his grace his
huge wings fanning the water into surging


adventure

eddies to the spot he arrived he was
half out of the water with a rush that carried
him almost bodily aboard the amazed
launch before he could stop and he saw
if the glare did not dazzle him two things
at once

  one was the tail of his lady-love vanish-
ing downward in a smother of foam the
other was a man erect in the bows of the
launch almost directly above his head
poised motionless with right arm upraised
and in his hand a pointed pole with a u-
shaped spear-head end-in fact a harpoon

  that much he saw but no more

  then the man struck his arm flashed
out the harpoon shot forward and down
and the manta nearly hurled the launch
into the air as he sprang at the bite of the
iron

  he had been struck by a grain truly
which is a species of harpoon with a heavy
detachable head made fast to a rope he
had been struck hard and the hateful
detachable head was fast the rope hiss-
ing out through the waves marked the
course of the maddened flying monster

  but if you think that to grain our devil-
ray was to catch him you know not the
inimitable manta this one retired across
the hanging gardens so beauteous of the
sea and-the launch went with him

  he went after one more monumental
leap not straight-for that would have
taken him from the vicinity of the school
and his lady-love-but flying along always
with that odd suggestion of a flying shadow
towing at first the launch behind him
i say at first advisedly because he con-
tinued to go about as steadily as a mail-
steamer but it was not after a time the
launch alone that he towed behind him
others launches and boats joined in the
fun-our manta saw no fun in it however-
hooked on astern of the launch and were
towed too in a steadily-growing procession
which after some hours numbered no less
than twelve craft

  and all the time the white-hot sun slowly
marched across the blue sky and the sea
shone like a winking labradorite shield
the man-of-war birds streaked and the
gulls screamed and far away on in the
doldrums the pacific poll with all sails
spread but never a ripple under her bows
shone like a gigantic floating pearl and
far away too from the launches-always
where they were not-a triangular back-fin

marked the passage of our mantas chosen
mate but though far away one noticed
that somehow mysteriously she was always
the center or the key to his league-long
evolutions

  then suddenly he stopped his wings
no longer flew but remained still curved
gracefully as always and he floated vol-
planed down down to the crimson and the
blue and the yellow sponges the snow-
white sand of the sea-floor and the rocks
covered with rainbow-hued shells

  and here on the bottom he settled-
flat like some enormous black carpet only
his peculiar whip-tail stuck up as to its
latter half at an angle his eyes shone
glassy the sinister eyes of all the sharks-
for what is a ray but a flattened shark-
his claspers slowly pawing that ineffable
blue water subdued now at that depth
hazy mysterious and still

  after that his tormentors might get him
up if they could at the end of half an
hours heated effort they admitted that
they could not whereupon things lan-
guished the sea-devil had got the laugh
of them it seemed the position had
reached an impasse

  just when things began to look like
freezing up for good the sea-devil
exploded all mines in quick succession
so to speak by himself getting a move on
and coming up to the surface like a whale
gone mad

  and then things happened

  the little fleet of launches and boats were
not at the moment in towing formation but
all clustered about their leader the launch
to which the manta was attached and-he
came up in the middle of them he did
more he went up-clean up in the air
many feet an appalling flying vision

  then he came down all two thousand
seven hundred pounds of him but he had
no control over his descent he simply fell

  those launches and boats parted com-
pany as if each had separately discovered
the others to be in quarantine for bubonic
plague but it was too late all the same
the giant of all the rays came down more
quickly than they could scatter

  it was the first launch-the launch that
had caught him-that received him

  there was one awful smashing impact
a wild and unutterable confusion a snarling
and boiling of waters a tornado of some
most wonderful language and-no launch
crotons



-unless you counted a crumpled splintered
thing knocked out of shape and bottom up
which would henceforth not be much good
to anybody

  moreover there was no devil-ray he
had gone and the grain and the rope that
held the grain had gone with him

  doubtless some observant eye might have
seen the end of the latter still fastened to
some match-woodwork driving away at
great speed over the sparkling sea towards
that triangular back-fin that half of an
immense lazy wing which from time to
time broke the surface with spray a mile
away but they were all too busy rescuing
the occupants of the launch to take notice

  one was past rescue in this world the
giant ray had fallen upon him another
had an arm broken and the sea nearly did
for the rest

  a mile away the trailing wood stopped
swerved sank reappeared and proceeded
slowly

  then-well then there were two triangu-
lar back-fins appearing from time to time
one behind the other and two immense
wings heaving out of the deep as their
owners canted at the turn of their upward
swimming curve the devil-ray the mons-
ter bat of the southern seas the manta
had gone back to his mate

  and you think it strange that he should
have done so with grain and rope attached
but that is only because you do not realize
the leviathan devil-ray the manta doubt-
less the rope would rot or get pulled off
and what is a grain more or less if not in
a vital place to such a cold-blooded moun-
tain of flesh besides was there not one
with him to help him forget

of all extinct caldera deep-pitting the great
dome ten thousand feet above the sea that
laced the shores of maui molokai showed
like a basking dragon lanai like a mam-
moth turtle the sharp ridges of oahu
caught the lifting light in slopes of slate
and sulfur and pink with gleams of green
forest and amethyst-veiled ravines

  land sea bird and fish the solitude of
undisturbed nature no sign of man no
fleck of sail no plume of smoke yet the
frigate birds breasting the stream of the
gale remained ever above an object midway
in the channel that between koko head
and laau point westernmost cape of mo-
lokai the leper-haunted is twenty-eight
miles wide it was an eighteen-foot whale-
boat held in some mysterious offshore cur-
rent born of uneven bottoms of prodigious
sea gorges between submarine cliffs and
mountain bases

  in the grip of this stream the boat main-
tained a sluggish progress against the trade
wind its white paint was blistered and
peeling from the planks slime and weeds
showed thickly as it rolled lazily to the
buoyant waves that spurned it scornfully
a spar mounted forward bare of boom or
block or canvas lolled on slack stays stale
water sloshed about the bottom boards

  a brown withered arm and clutching
hand showed above the freeboard jerking
to the pitch and toss of the boat this be-
longed to a dead and frightful melanesian
whose long empty belly had bloated hide-
ously and whose filed teeth stained with
betel and tobacco grinned between drawn-

back shriveled lips the body stark naked
sprawled in the bows on its back another
face downward was amidships jack-knived
across a thwart a dingy cloth about the
loins fluttering in the breeze there were
four oars close to these two there was an-
other at the stern dragging idle in the sea
secured by marlin to the stem of the steering
rowlock

  there a man sat hunched half-clad in
dirty white drill trousers and cotton sing-
let his head drooped low on his chest his
black tangle of beard fanned over his knees
riffled in the wind his feet were bare and
puffed and broken as were his wrists and
hands the skin had burned as dark as
that of the natives hatless his untrimmed
hair was backblown in long wisps that re-
vealed the features of a tortured face that
looked like nothing so much as the head
of a rapacious bird dead and dessicating

  in the boat was no semblance of food or
water a rusted lard-can seemed to have
been used as bailer the headstaves of a
small keg were gaping to port and star-
board equidistant four fathoms astern the
triangular dorsals of two sharks moved in
unvarying position sea-jackals waiting for
sea or wind to fling them their fill above
the beady eyes of the frigate birds gazed
down a little while ago they had seen
signs of life in the figure in the stern he
was still a man not a corpse now-they
were not quite sure

  the wasting of the white mans tissues
emphasized the bigness of his skeleton the
shoulders were broad the shoulder-blades
projected to throw wide shadows the hoop-
ing ribs proclaimed enormous lung power
and the cordy muscles unsheathed by flesh
looking like underlays of old rope beneath
the skin told of a once-powerful body

  oahu shifted in color discovering form
maui changed from a great hump of azure
to deep-seamed solid lava canefields rising
on its scoriaceous sides like an emerald tide
molokai disclosed sheer cliffs with the un-
reefed sea chafing in white floss of foam at
their buttresses the boat sloshed on with
the gait of a hopeless sea-tramp the crisp
waves slap-slapping at it contemptuously
testing every seam tilting it experimentally
in the shuttle of the current that bucked the
wind

  the sharp fins moved up closer an
upper tail lobe showed for an instant in a
swirl of foam as the brute to port made a

swift dash there was the gleam of a gray-
white belly as it turned and crunched vi-
ciously at the steering oar shearing off the
blade rocking the boat sending the steers-
mans head nodding the birds dropping
down wheeled on banked wings spiraling
on the windlane-upward they were not
yet satisfied

  the inter-island steamer moi wahine
came out from behind laau point on her
course from lahaina to honolulu rolling
in the ground swell wallowing abjectly as
she struck the open channel she was due
at honolulu at seven oclock and she was an
hour and a half late the mate was on the
bridge a half-white keen and quick of eye
a true viking of the south a born sailor
his sight was as good as that of his white
skipper plus binoculars

  he saw the open boat a mile away a dead
spot amid the continuous flash and run of
the sea it lay on the steamers course
had it not done so it is doubtful if the mate
would have made a shift because the moi
wahine was late because he feared the
wrath of captain roberts and because he
did not at first see anything of the bodies
as things were he hesitated to awaken the
captain as he must do if he was to take
more than passing toll of the derelict on
such slight threads do the pregnant affairs
of life and death often seem to be suspended

  captain roberts came to the bridge ill
tempered authoritative

  whats the pilikia waking a man out

of his sleep what the -s the matter

with you cummings

  the mate pointed and the captain rubbed
his slumber-heavy eyes

 a boat where hmph get me my
glass

  he made long inspection forehead cor-
rugating a deep crease between his eye-
brows

  three men he reported two of em
natives all dead boat aint worth picking
up hmph

  the cable supply boat from midway
sighted a wreck on two brothers reef last
week no one aboard breaking up

maybe-

   maybe dont pay for time or fuel
cummings were late two trips running

and-to pay for it with the opposition

line knocking us every chance

  well almost run her down skipper
itll make a good story

 hmph

  the skipper was not above notoriety it
helped to make a captain popular and
here was an excellent excuse for lateness

  captain roberts of inter-island steamer moi
wahine picks up boat and shipwrecked mariners
in kaiwi channel	

  he could see the headlines taste the
importance dead or alive the rescued
would furnish good copy for the reporters
if dead hed tow the boat alive hed
succor them give them first aid become a
hero of the first order

  saved from the sea by sharp-eyed skipper

  it had an alliterative unction that

  he rang to half-speed to slow to stop
he rapped out an order and the bronzed
crew agile with a dexterity unknown to
steamer hands of northern latitudes used
to perilous landings as everyday events
swarmed into a boat and gripped their long
oars as the falls ran out and were cast off
the moi wahine rolling to the rail in the
trough smacked her remaining lifeboats on
the wave-tops and the uneasy passengers
tossed and groaned in their coffin-like bunks
unmindful of the revelation of tragedy other
than their own

  eyah this haole alive sang out a
sailor as he peered into the face of the
bearded man while his mates held on to the
gunwale two kanaka make loa fifteen
minutes later the whaleboat towed astern
with the two corpses the white man was
in the pursers berth with that sagacious
functionary bending over him striving to
force an illegal stimulant between the
clamped teeth the sharks had disappeared
the frigate-birds flown off with a petulant
cry

  on the table in the cabin of captain
roberts there lay a long-bladed knife more
weapon than tool it had been found be-
tween the survivors feet

  if thats rust he said to himself and
under his breath leastwise if thats water
rust ive never stuck a pig

the superintendent of the sailors
home stood by the window of his
office looking out over the roofs of
the old fishmarket to where the japanese
sampans eastern-hulled but western-rig-
ged were making for the beach with their
canvas furled and gasketed sturdy sons of


adventure

nippon black pompadours and coppery
skins distinct in contrast with their cotton
sleeveless undershirt and short drawers
working the heavy bulbous steering sweeps
with the regular swings of pendulums
strong armed and big calved with naked
feet clamped to the thwarts

  he was an efficient executive but he was
going to be glad to get rid of the outgoing
inmate he was expecting to enter the office
he ceased tapping on the glass watching
the sampans and glanced again over his
official docket in the case of james watson
master and owner of the trading-barkentine
arabella bound from levuka fiji to san
francisco wrecked and abandoned a total
loss on two brothers reef watson the sole
survivor after an open-boat voyage of nine-
teen days two dead marshall islanders be-
ing the other occupants of the whaleboat
taken in tow by captain roberts of the
inter-island steamer moi wahine

  there were dates of entry and dismissal
medical report inventory of the skippers
scant effects a note that captain james
watson claimed to be an american citizen
born in san francisco in the year eighteen-
hundred and sixty-seven newspaper clip-
pings that included the coroners verdict
and the story given out by captain watson
as soon as he was able to endure an inter-
view these comprised the written and
printed record but there were mental an-
notations in the mind of the superintendent
and they troubled him

  two brothers reef he knew lay some
seven-hundred miles in direct line from
where the boat was picked up in mid-
channel northwest from honolulu one of
the string of islets shoals and reefs that
following roughly the same trend as the
hawaiian group scatter from bird island
to midway where the cable angles between
honolulu and guam

  he read over watsons story brief de-
scriptive to the point-if it told all the
truth a faulty compass and chronometer
an error in dead reckoning dirty weather
that hid sight of sun or star for a week
such the reasons for disaster the piling up
of the barkentine the ripping-off of her
bottom on the jagged dead coral in a frenzy
of squall two boats launched-one lost
in the mad smother immediately-a snarled
fall to his own boat in the headlong con-
fusion provisions pitching out with the
ships papers the skippers strong box con-

taining a small fortune in pearls the boats
compass and the arabellas log

  there were six marshall islanders in the
crew of the barkentine a white mate a
half-white quartermaster and acting mate
a white supercargo a cook who was hapa-
pake half-brown half-yellow tahitian
chinese the mate the quartermaster and
three of the kanakas in the lost boat with
the captain the supercargo and the cook
besides the rest of the kanakas six all told
three accounted for what of the others

  there was the knife with its coated
stain-and the hint of roberts of the moi
wahine to back certain sea-purged blotches
on the bottom boards he knew what they
must have suffered on that sea-trek of
seven-hundred miles-nearer a thousand for
them one small keg of water and some
broken biscuit infested with copra bugs-
enough for five a day per man for six days
nineteen days of exposure blown north
blown south the sail claimed in a squall and
paid for in rain then long laboring at the
oars to make easting with hands split with
sores with weakening muscles

  on what did they live so long that the
skipper two weeks after the last of the
biscuit retained sufficient spark of life to
be fanned back to full flame

  we killed a shark said watson two
of them trailed us from the first i lashed
my sheathknife to an oar and lanced it
we had to throw over most of the meat
after three days because it was putrid

  but the mate of the moi wahine had seen
two sharks trailing the boat the lashing
had vanished the marlin on the rowlock
was insufficient for such a purpose that
the marshall islanders would have no
scruples in eating the long pig that walks
was a foregone conclusion did the cook
or the quartermaster die of exhaustion or
were they butchered watson the strongest
and the sole survivor the only witness
what part did he play in this

  the cook li yuen the captain had
told the reporters drank salt water and
went mad he jumped overboard in the
night and the other shark got him a spar
had cracked the quartermasters skull when
we struck the sun grilled his brains i
reckon he died with his last share of
biscuit beside him sixth day after leavin
the reef the kanakas just quit the way
they will died out like ashes

  a likely story enough but-
crotons



  the superintendent had known all sorts
and conditions of seamen at their worst but
he felt for captain watson a repulsion that
he could not set aside if ever a man might
be pirate-murderer-so he fancied was
this wasted giant now well recovered curs-
ing through delirium and convalescence
alike with a hellish and rotten imagination
roaring bawdy songs or acting with such
sullen malevolence that the rest shunned
him as they would a suppurating leper it
was true that in his fever-madness he had
disclosed nothing of any hideous rites con-
cerning the boat voyage he had said nothing
while subconscious it had been as if he
had locked that strong box of his memory
with the key of his will before the will failed
him

  it was the eyes of the man that were the
worst thing about him the superintendent
fancied at times they looked like small
windows of black glass through which one
gazed at a void sometimes a murky flame
seemed leaping in that space back of the
pupils once he had seen something there
as if a devil lizard-quick had suddenly
peered through each orb the official was
neither a deeply religious man nor a super-
stitious one but he told himself that here
if ever was a man possessed of a devil a
man whose lusts had never been bridled
who reveled in wickedness less man than
monster if ever eyes deserved the title his
eye were evil eyes they inevitably affected
the superintendent with a fluttering nausea
a lurking horror and a fear

  the door opened and watson entered
the superintendent nodded and took seat
at his desk shuffling his papers finally he
took the knife from a drawer and laid it on
top of them for the first time he glanced
at the captain watsons eyes inscrutable
as agate momentarily viewed the weapon
swept on across the superintendents fea-
tures to a framed motto on the wall his
beard was swart from collar line to cheek-
bone through the thick bush of it the
other thought he detected a twitch of lip a
supercilious insolent grin the targeted
motto read-

rock of ages cleft for me

  there are certain subtle infrequent
coordinations of the senses that bring about
swift unusual emotions ancient warnings
that too much civilization has dulled an
irresistible attraction or revulsion that

prickles the scalp lifts the skin in goose-flesh
and raises ghost hairs down the human
spine watson seemed to yield an emana-
tion as distinct as the draft of air from
oven or ice-box as unpleasant as the noxious
exhalations of a marsh the superintendent
was keen to be rid of him

  you are well enough to leave

  this was statement rather than query

  aye and glad to im sick of butterin
bread to psalm tunes and rotten butter
at that

  others enjoy both you hold a masters

ticket

 i was master and owner yons my
knife the rust has fair ruined it

  we thought you might prefer to-clean
it yourself

  wheres my boat demanded watson
as he slid the knife into the waistband of the
slop-serge trousers provided by the home

   i imagine youll have to see the collector
of the port i believe the steamship com-
pany has it

  with a lien on it

  i know nothing about that there is
a berth open for you if you want to take it
and berths are not over plentiful just now
captain watson the rhoderick dhu load-
ing with sugar at ewa for san francisco
needs a second mate i understand you
were bound for san francisco

  watson fouled the air with his oath

  me-third fiddle on a sugar-hooker
me i had twenty thousand in pearls and
shell on the arabella i was for the coast
and a touch of life through with rancid
copra and turtle through with rottin out
shell and dryin trepang twenty thousand
gone-like that

  he snapped fingers on both hands like
pistol shots

  but im takin no middle watches on a

stinkin reekin sugar tub to - with

it

  as you like

   come this is supposed to be a charitable
institution aint it supported by volun-
tary contributions for the relief of ship-
wrecked sailors do you send a man out
lacking a couple of dollars to chink together
youve got a scale aint you whats the
stake for a skipper thats lost everything
you can afford to be liberal it aint your
money

  there was no cadging whine to watson
the words were scored with mockery yet


adventure

 meant literally there was no warmth to
 the superintendents reply

   you have your boat

    with salvage on it

 i think not under the circumstances
 it wouldnt fetch ten dollars come
 are you tryin to save money against a
 raise for yourself what are the rules
 there are some funds that may be used

 as you suggest i dont know-

   you dont know-what

   the captain leaned forward his splay
 hands open on the oak of the desk the
 leaping devils were peering through murky
 flame back of the black pupils irresistible
 fear swept the other as the wind stirs an
 aerial harp the thought of the knife forced
 itself he held his voice tremorless with an
 effort normally he was far from a coward
 but he changed the ending of his split
 sentence

    i dont know that there are exact sums
 specified for degrees of rank i could give
 you twenty dollars

   you could then give it me and be

 done with this - rigmarole twenty

  dollars ive chucked that much to a diving
  boy at apia and bought many a kiss at
  double the rate

    from mr coyles special fund
 coyle did you say coyle what
 coyle

    it was a command imperative threaten-
 ing the finger-tips of watsons right hand
 tamped into the palm with a thud as he
 balled his great fist

   what coyle

   amos coyle founder of the home
 the superintendent nodded to indicate
 the framed picture on the wall back of the
 captain the latter whirled lithe as a
 lightweight pugilist upon the balls of his
 feet he seemed to expect to confront a
 man instead of a portrait hung above a
 brief setting-forth of the endowment and
 the intent of the institution thrusting his
 fists into the pockets of his too small coat
 watson stood inspecting it it seemed to
 rjlhe other that his wide shoulders shook as
 if with laughter straining the seams and
 wrinkling the shoddy cloth but when he
 turned back to the desk he showed no emo-
 tion his eyes were black glass again
 backed by void

    was he ever a sailor he asked quietly
  enough

    i cannot say not that i know of mr

coyle came here before i did he has been
a plantation factor for many years

  ah regular pillar of the church i sup-
pose sings hymns boss of the sunday
school passes the plate in church worth
a heap of money

  the superintendent ignored the sardonic
quality of the remarks he had heard their
like before but never sounded so deeply

  mr coyle is an influential and highly
respected citizen to him you are indebted
for your stay here your medical treatment

your clothes-

  these slops

  and the twenty dollars i shall require
a receipt

  to-with your twenty dollars and

your second mates berth to - with

the whole canting crew of you as for
him-

  he checked himself abruptly his eyes
became slits his mouth opened in the black
bush of his beard the superintendent had
a fleeting impression of the tip of a red
tongue protruding between yellow teeth a
mask of satanic merriment then watson
was gone he watched him from the win-
dow going swiftly down the steps striding
purposefully toward fort street his chin
was up the black beard thrust forward
indubitably he was laughing

time was when many of the houses
of honolulus successful ones-mer-
chant planter banker factor-were
set back from nuuanu avenue on the road
to the pali with lawns in froftt where drive-
ways ran under stately royal palms entwined
with broad-leaved vines in front there was
hybiscus for hedging or perhaps a stone-
wall covered with night-blooming cereus
beds of gorgeous laurel-leaved crotons
variegated from yellow and green to deepest
crimson cannas and frangipanni ylang-
ylang riot of jasmine bougainvillea and
huapala vines silver golden purple scar-
let of poinsettia and stately poinciana fan
palms travelers palms papaia and bananas
mango avocado tamarind date and fig
vi and star and custard apple oranges and
shaddocks aladdins gardens where the
fruit hung like jewels and the perfume of
the flowers was borne far out to sea by the
trade-wind sweeping through the pah gap

  then came the territorial annexation
the royal standard hard beset by sporadic
revolutionists came down and in the place
crotons



of the blended crosses copied from the
british jack there floated the stars and
stripes then came many things electric
street cars instead of mule power asphalted
streets a fire and police alarm system a
native legislature and a governor country
clubs and golf courses trotting races to
supplant the old events with island-bred
island-owned and native-ridden horses polo
the horrible exploitation of the ukulele and
so-called hawaiian music and dance mov-
ing pictures and a chamber of commerce
with a big publicity and tourist committee
came real-estate experts opening new tracts
and architects introducing stucco to replace
wood-stucco or shingles-bungalows and
italian renaissance instead of the wide-
lanaid french-windowed high-ceiled de-
signs that had come about naturally with
their hints of mid-victorian building plans
imported from new england with the
second missionary generation there was
exodus to pacific heights to manoa valley
up the slopes of tantalus above the mos-
quito belt to a cooler climate where neapo-
litan violets bloom and ferns flourish

  there are a few of these old residences
left even lived in by the original owners
one of the latter was amos coyle his
house was well above the cemetery high
enough to overlook the town the harbor
and the sea beyond the reef to view dia-
mond head to the east beyond the rice-
fields the waiananae range to the west
beyond pearl harbor back of it the pali
where the fresh winds blow always through
the gap winds that once carried the dying
groans of warriors dying after kame-
hamehas triumphing charge to the verge
of the precipice and-for the conquered-
beyond

  it was a rambling comfortable big-
roomed place a hundred and fifty feet from
the road screened and sheltered on all sides
in grounds befitting its quality there lived
amos and his daughter avis nineteen only
child who had cost her mothers life and
who was winsome enough to have turned
her fathers grief into a tender memory
lao chu was the major-domo of the estab-
lishment

  he had entered honolulu with his master
when the latter came up from the south
with the proceeds of a profitable sale of
pearls at the great mart in tahiti lao chu
ruled the coyle menage with wisdom justice
and precision over chinese house-boys and

yard-boys over the japanese maids who
flitted about their duties like demure but-
terflies in their kimonos and avis coyle
ruled lao chu

  in his eyes she was the personification
of grace and truth beauty and virtue and
all goodness-a plum tree in the spring
giving great promise of fair and abundant
fruit next to his gilded joss symbol of
ancient philosophies lao chu worshiped
the golden girl whose hair was woven sun-
shine and whose eyes matched the color of
the deep seas whose laugh was like the
chime of wind-bells whose nature was in-
comparable

  whatever coyle might have been before
he arrived at the island capital-and there
were many who remembered him rough of
speech and manner-he had prospered and
mellowed in the process his profits had
been honorable he had made good friends
and kept them he was all that watson
had ironically suggested a church member
who practised on monday what was
preached on sunday and who had not made
his money through native mortgages but
through shrewdness joined to scrupulous
honesty a just man a charitable upright
citizen

  avis was away at kailua across the
eastern promontory of oahu on her re-
turn she was to be married to young
walsingham son of hawaiis railroad mag-
nate a fine match for avis coyle as society
saw it a magical mating for george wal-
singham as he and a string of disappointed
outdistanced suitors saw it it was a
maidenly retreat before surrender this trip
to kailua even george was only occasional-
ly allowed to sail around in his power yacht
or roll across in his high-powered car

  in her absence the sun ceased to shine
for coyle-nov-retiredfrom active business
with more time on his hands than he knew
well how to handle for content as for
lao chu-

  i think flower no glow while you stop
along kailua missy he had said and
amos had indorsed him

  avis laughed

  just the same lao dont you forget to
have those crotons shifted by the time i
get back make them the central bed of
the back driveway they are magnificent
but they are too gloomy for the front now
that the trees have grown so overhead
they are almost funereal you dont mind


adventure

daddy-captain well have a pool in
their place with a fountain when i get
back

  coyle and lao chu surveyed the shrub-
bery with its varnished leaves of deep crim-
son veined in black under their shade the
mynahs hid their stealings lao nodded
his wise old head bald and parchment
skinned his slant eyes beaming

  i make you plomise missy i fix time
you come back then maybe you come
stop along this place afteh you mally lele
while maybe

  of course ive promised havent i
daddy-captain two whole months of
every year with surprize visits to see that
lao chu keeps up to the mark you know
what i mean lao

  she shook an unnecessary finger at him
it was a habit of lao with avis away to
wait alone upon his master to prepare his
meals to keep the servants in subjection
remote from library and dining-room from
the south lanai that overlooked the sea
the rest of the house was unused when the
plum-blossom was absent but it was kept
in order the mock severity of avis was a
pleasant fiction a joke retained from child-
hood

  the new bed was laid out at the rear
the crotons were ready for transplanting
under the direction of lao master of cuisine
of service of decoration of horticulture of
many crafts that he had long foregone to
practise ten years older than the man he
served-and coyle was nearing sixty-lao
stood bland efficient listening respectfully

 mcgregor says- mcgregor was the
head-gardener of the great emerson estate
established by the banker prince at wai-
manu-they should have the roots dipped
in liquid mud and be kept moist and cool
the best time to transplant is after sunset
or before sunrise

  lao nodded and contrived indescribably
to suggest his opinion of the imported
marvel coyle chuckled

  you dont think much of the scotch-
man eh lao i told him i knew youd
handle the job without any trouble it was
emerson that mentioned it avis had been
telling him of her plans

  he chuckled again and broke off his body
suddenly rigid at a boisterous hail that
brought with it instant vivid-far too
vivid-memories long since buried now
hideously unearthed lao chus hooded

eyelids slid back forth and down hiding a
swift gleam in his sloe-like eyes his face
seemed suddenly to lapse into a deeper
inscrutability as hot wax smooths

  captain watson of the arabella in swag-
gering drunken attitude stood on the
garden path hands on his hips his shoul-
ders shaking with mirth the tip of his red
tongue showing back of him was an im-
potent indignant chinese yard-boy

  startled you did i amos my hearty
and blast my eyes if it isnt chu old
chu-chu of the good start the best cook
that ever fit a galley fire double luck

blast me amos but this is a-of a way

to greet an old friend old birds of a
feather jolly blackbirds met again to part
no more

  he trolled out the last words in raucous
baritone coyle wiped away the sweat that
had started on his forehead

  black watson for gods sake jim
come in the house

  thats better amos thats iflie kind
of welcome ive been lookin forard to
chu-chu bring us somethin to pledge old
days bring a glass for yourself blast me
im not fussy it aint the first time weve
all swigged from the same pannikin wiki-
wiki my lad

  he stamped up the steps of the south
lanai beside his involuntary host and
slumped into a wicker chair that creaked
under his weight

  inside jim

  coyle spoke like a man spent with running
his throat was dry his nerves twitching

  its-its cooler in the house but
theres nothing to drink jim i-dont use
it hawaiis dry

  watson guffawed

  dont use it thats a good un amos
coyle the slickest slipperiest supercargo in

the south seas pride of the beach a-

among the women dont use liquor none
in the house then get it chu-chu can
rustle it tomorrow you can begin to
stock up if hawaiis dry well moisten it
youll have a cigar for me amos

  they were in the house now watson
sprawling on a davenport feet on one arm
his eyes caught sight of a silver frame on
the table back of him and he picked it up
surveying it with increasing interest emit-
ting a long low whistle

  whos this beauty amos not your
wife
crotons

  no shes dead its my daughter
avis shes away

  and thank god she is eh amos well
ill be right here when she comes back

got a soft snuggery here ill share it you

in again youve done well why shouldnt

  his eyes feasted on the bright young
beauty of the photograph coyle reached
for the frame and watson relinquished it
with a laugh chu entering with a tray
and glasses caught the action

  plitty soon i bling samshu he an-
nounced that kind all i can do light
now

  he left his back to them ignoring
watson

  this is better than your other house
amos said watson sucking at his cigar
after he spat the bitten end on the floor and
followed it with the match

sanctimonious alms-flingin hymn-singin

  lao entered as if he had been waiting the
word he brought with him a slim brown
jug shaped with a short neck and tiny
handle when he uncorked it the sickly
odor of rice wine filled the room

  three swigs chu chu one for you

i know your tricks you yellow devil you

might slip me a fare-you-well powder now
then amos down with it it aint sunday

again- what did you say her name was
amos

  never mind if we must talk well talk
of what weve been together she is not of
that life youll understand that jim
watson

  there was a pause lao chu sucked in
his breath with the slightest of hissings as
the two white men eyed each other watson
covered concession with a laugh

  then well drink to old times to the
good start and her cargo lord i wonder
what your church pals would think amos
if they knew youd been a black-birder and
a shell-swiper more samshu chu chu

house then see to it theres white mans

ber one supper see to it

  lao chu eyed his master impassively
watson exploded a volley of oaths

  i kicked you round the deck and over-
board once chu chu time you spilled
the soup on my arm remember that

  i lemembeh

  then look out and get out im goin
to talk with amos

  there were wines and whisky served that
evening the blinds were close drawn the
servants kept sequestered lao chu cooked
and served the room was filled with fumes
of rank tobacco coyle was pale and silent
watson crimson-faced and loud

  old hymn-singer he rallied well
sing after a bit you can play on the
pianner amos i reckon you aint got a
harmonium chu you keep away from the
back of me ill feel safer amos remem-
ber the time the skipper dressed up in your

monium on the sand and the crew singin

adventure

on worth twelve quid apiece delivered
at the plantation four-and-thirty black-
birds baked in a pie some oven down
there in the hold of the good start

  when the real bishop went ashore a
month later they clubbed him and kai-
kaid him that ud make a fine story for
your church friends eh amos the skip-
pers dead but pinraif sparks is alive re-
member pinrail amos he was second
mate used to pack a belayin-pin in his
boot to tickle the crew hes alive and so
is harry belcher i know where to find em
make good witnesses theyve got no
character to lose any moren i have no

fine house no lovely daughter-

  amos had been sitting with his hand over
his eyes now as lao chu shifted quiet
and swift as a shadow when a blind is raised
amos coyle leaped to his feet with face
contorted clutching a carving knife

  watson rose kicking back his chair
forcing chu aside as he dodged it he
jumped back to the wall and whipped a
pistol from his pocket

  no you dont he cried i sold my
boat and got this popper and a few drinks
down at the anchor thats where i found
out where you lived its loaded and itll
go off if you dont put down that knife
chu-chu you edge away

  curse you watson ill-

  no you wont put it down -it

amos the girls name slipped out let
harmony prevail ive got the whip but i
aint goin to crack it too often open up
another bottle chu-chu harmony thats
the ticket close harmony like we used
to chu-chu you keep out of the singin
youve got no ear for music now then
amos both together

  he swayed drunkenly but he was not out
of control as amos put down the knife
watson began to beat time with the pistol
as he sang

     i know a sweet samoan girl

         she lives at upolu

     and when my schooner makes her port

        she dons her holoku

      her waist it is so slender

her opu so much-

the modernists in science tell us
this-and the alienists agree with
them-that the study of physi-
ognomy is as now applied useless the
face is not an index to the character the
man with the bulldog jaw may lack the

courage of a whipped cur the one with the
stupendous brow be deficient in knowledge
while the rat-faced chinless weak-eyed
mortal may be a very lion in battle a person
of wide understanding yet there are suf-
ficient facial and spiritual coincidences to
satisfy most of us with the old theories

  the portrait of amos coyle at the sailors
home was an excellent counterfeit of his
physical presentment and it was equally a
mirror to his present nature it was the
antithesis of the bullish bestial features of
captain watson and showed a man whose
features were cleanly cut whose ees were
wide apart nose aquiline forehead high and
wide mouth full without sensuality a hand-
some man a man of force and sterling
character so you would read it it dis-
played benevolence tolerance humor
frankness firmness

  to judge by the ancient standards here
was the face of a man either endowed early
with all the christian virtues tempered in
later life by trials or one who had success-
fully fought down the whisperings and im-
pulses of evil conquering the old adam in
manly fight

  amos coyle had not been the only adven-
turous foot-free youth whose early crops of
wild oats have been supplanted by hard
wheat supplying gracious harvests ke
had plowed under the weeds and -used them
for fertilization he had cultivated the soil
until the yield was great and regular amos
coyle the smart and tricky supercargo
strutting along the beaches with a bloom
of hybiscus flirtatiously stuck behind one
ear amos coyle black-birder pearl-shell
poacher consorting with those with whom
circumstance had flung him but whom he
nevertheless considered of his own choice
and kidney amos coyle to whom irrever-
ence was a sign of smartness a bid for
applause-had died and was born again

  his part in the events that had led to the
murder of bishop hartwell on the beach at
new georgia had been undertaken as a jest
without foreknowledge that the natives
were to be forcibly recruited without
dreaming that the gentle cleric whose mantle
they had usurped and smutted would be
struck down with a club a prayer on his
lips as his brains were spattered

  when the news reached coyle he was at
gizo magisterial and trading-station of the
central solomons none then knew the
rightful cause of the murder but it was the
crotons



cause of mourning even among the hardened
crowd with which he was drinking it
sobered him to staggering out into the night
where the bright moon sought him out with
crystal pointers beneath the palms that
rustled-murderer- it drove him to a mis-
sion meeting where he saw a stronger light
visioning an x-ray of his spotted soul and
loathing it

  at first his repentance and its deeds were
more of the will than the spirit in time his
acts became the instinctive reactions of a
nature remorseful and hopeful as a pearl
broker he prospered at length he found
full faith he believed that his wealth had
been sent him as token of approval he was
positive that god had rewarded him with
the woman who became all his life had
chastened him lest he become vainglorious
taking her from him leaving a token in avis
as an encouragement to continue in good
works

  the muddiest pool may clear if the source
is pure coyle achieved sincerity and
nobility of character the young amos
was buried and now-now this ghost of
the past rather this living ghoul had
opened the grave and threatened to dis-
play the festering corpse of early sins

  through the senses all emotions rise
will controls or permits a loose rein modi-
fies guides by the light of reason or by that
higher control that is termed psychological
when decision is reached that is not merely
for policy but that good may come the
chain from nerve to soul force is continuous
after a week of watsons enforced detested
presence black murder raged in the con-
volutions of coyles brain he left his will
unsummoned he refused to listen to the
voice of his conscience he neglected his
constant practice of prayer against this
emotion of hatred fought that of love
aroused by the contemplation of avis pic-
ture wrestling it to a deadlock

  for himself he might have fled started
afresh after buying freedom from watson
at any cost such a course meant the
wrecking of avis happiness her mother
had known of his misdeeds and soothed the
confession with heart balm with faith in his
regeneration with steady hope and help
avis was her mother over again she might
go with him casting love aside in filial
renunciation such sacrifice he could not
accept

  for himself alone he did not care for

  her he would have cheerfully flung over
hope of heaven and gone down to hell with
this devil after he had choked from him
life and power of vileness but-he was
tied and delivered there was no way open
murder it would out his wife would
wait for him in vain even if by some miracle
he avoided discovery in three days avis
would be returning home to make the final
preparations for her wedding at which
coyle glimpsed the mocking presence of
watson that was at first a darker
shadow had fallen

  watson had hinted of settling down in
honolulu the slimy octopus had dared
to think of twining tentacles about the fresh
radiance of avis hints only put when lao
chu was absent devilish insinuations and
innuendos that left one dread certainty
that however far he might ultimately dare
to go watsons resolution was set to break
off avis engagement that coyle should
do so under threat of exposure then
would come pressure upon the girl to favor
her fathers old time friend and benefactor

  on his knees by his bed coyle sank his
nails deep into his palms symbol of the
agony of his spirit his face had become
haggard his hair grayer the lines about his
mouth deeply bitten he had no sleep
his affairs were neglected the japanese
maids had been sent on vacation lao chu
vouched for the chinese boys yet the
house could not hope to hide its secrets

  the purchase of liquor must bring about
whisperings the lights late in the night
the sounds of drunken revelry must loose
rumor and scandal concerning the man who
now denied himself to all pleaded sickness
for the dereliction of church duties and then
denied himself to all visitors the wal-
singhams had been reserved about the
match between their son and avis coyle
it had been plain that the parents of old
new england stock would have preferred
the father of their daughter-in-law to be
one who could speak more frankly more
proudly of his own connections

  he seemed to have lost the faculty of
prayer he was numb of soul and he had
drunk deeply with watson the only way-
with a show of aptitude for the captains
pleasures his reminiscences of the old wild
life-that he had been able to keep the latter
within the house wine and song were be-
ginning to pall the lechery of the mans
nature demanded satisfaction for all his


adventure

  lusts he proposed to introduce vicious
women into the house

  and all coyle could say seeking light
wasgod god god no more even
in dumb petition

  the next day passed and the next over
and over in the back of his mind as may a
malefactor in the death cell coyle toiled
in the weary treadmill of his fate seeking
an eleventh hour of escape the new
strength within him fought against the old
violent impulses lao chu silent impas-
sive automatic had begun to regard him
strangely he fancied thinking perhaps that
coyle was backsliding to the old way were
they ways for which lao chu himself
secretly pined the ways of the oriental
were inscrutable even after all the years

  it was the night before avis happy avis
was to return home lao chu had the bed
ibr the crotons prepared the plants had
been removed dipped in soft mud after
sunset they would be in place by sunrise
the next morning lao chu would keep
his plomise though the heavens fell

  watson had staggered off to bed for
a beauty sleep he announced with a leer
coyle sat at the littered table a gaunt stony
figure of despair slowly gathering resolu-
tion when lao came to remove the mess
of bottles glasses ash coyle waved him
out sitting on alone far into the night he
felt god had forsaken him for he had cursed
god in word and deed

  yet in his room he kneeled by the bed
as much from weariness as anything with
one vague despairing hope that he might
yet be shown a way other than the one he
had determined upon but the posture of
petition found prayer wanting aforetime
he had felt ecstasy the dynamic thrill of
connection with the all powerful source
tonight the connection was wanting he
was only an old man condemned to worse
than death tormented in a living hell

  so lao chu found him bringing him a
cooling drink coyle took the chilled
tumbler gratefully for his throat seemed
filled with cinders

  i clush flesh tamalind flesh lime velly
nice coyle sipped at it set it down
clutching at laos afm speaking in a
hoarse strange voice

  im going to kill him lao its the only
way

  wha fo no you klistian no can
kill suppose you kill you hang much

  betteh he hang you wait along tomollow
now you dlink you lie down tly to sleep
i put out the light

  no for gods sake no i cant stand
the dark

  but he lay down and the old chinaman
who had been cook aboard the good start
soothed him as if he had been a feverish
child when he saw coyles body relax and
his eyes close he stood at the door before
he shut and locked it from the outside slip-
ping the key into his sleeve sure that the
soporific he had administered would last
until the morning

in his own room lao chu looked
quietly about him he went to the
window and saw the lights burning
back of drawn curtains in the boys quarters
where they were playing fan tan

  there were two shrines in the room one
of his heathen deity before which he lighted
punk sticks the other a picture of avis
coyle exquisitely framed in carved sandal-
wood signed to my friend lao chu
before that stood a tiny oxblood vase of
ming in it a spray of frangipani two of the
white velvety blooms sending out fragrance
the punks could not dilute

  there was a smile on the yellow face as
he looked at the photograph the same smile
with which he had surveyed the sleeping
coyle it sobered as he turned to the joss
and kneeling touched his forehead to the
floor in devout obeisance perhaps he wor-
shiped without doubt he found in-
spiration when after a long interval he
got to his feet his face was placid with
content

  he opened a chest of teak reenforced with
metal cunningly locked he sought at the
bottom of a heap of miscellany and brought
out a small lacquered box in it was a ball
of dark brown substance the size of a large
marble greasy looking slightly elastic re-
sembling guttapercha with an odor of wet
and musty cloths this he rolled out on
top of a bureau examining it with the
utmost care it was the witch-ball of a
tahunga a tindalo wizard taken from a
deserted hut on savo island in the solomons
after head-hunters had raided it as lao
cautiously squeezed it a sharp sliver of what
looked like bone a tiny fang protruded

  lao chu descended to the kitchen in
the pantry was a young white cock in a
crate brought in from the yard earlier in
crotons



the evening it blinked at the light lao
switched on then began to peck at its
grain he opened the crate and dexter-
ously seized it by legs and saddle then
tucked it under his arm stroking the gleam-
ing hackles parting them he pressed the
warlocks weapon against the flesh in-
stantly the cocks neck fell limp its eyes
closed its beak half opening remaining in
that position no other change appeared
the scarlet comb retained its color watch-
ing it carefully he presently lifted a lid
the eye with its black pupil and reddish
brown iris was still bright

  satisfied he locked the dead bird away
in a cupboard with a key from his executive
bunch and went silently up through the
house to the door of watsons room he
knew it to be locked probably secured in
some other manner he knew the jalousie
shutters opening on the upper lanai would
be fast he knew that watson slept with
his gun under his mattress close at hand
a houseboy had seen its imprint lao chu
had never entered the room since watson
occupied it but he knew all these things

  watson tasted nothing that was not first
sampled by his involuntary host he watched
his cigars he was never too drunk for
precautions if he did not intend to injure
too soon the goose that laid golden eggs
he took equal care against his own possible
injury

  lao chu listened to the stertorous snoring
within the citadel then he began to tap
on the door with a peculiar variant rhythm

  it got through to even watsons alcohol
dulled consciousness after a while the cap-
tain of the arabella had traveled in savage
lands in constant danger and his outer
sentinels were attuned to react swiftly

  instantly he was as wide awake as his
semi-sobriety permitted lao heard the re-
moval of a chair braced under the door
handle then the click of the lock the door
opened swiftly the room dark lao had
switched the landing light and he stood in
plain view watson clad in his hosts
pajamas too small for his chest unfastened
there showing shags of black hair thrust
his pistol forward lao stood unblinking
hands folded in his sleeves

  whats the matter you yellow devil

   i like speak along of you velly special
velly plivate

  watson hesitated frowned brushed some
sleep from his eyes with the back of his

hand found the switch by the door and
turned it

   velly plivate eh well its got to be
velly interestin or youll be velly solly
come in and shut the door

  he sat on the edge of the bed and lao
stood with bent elbows before him his
hands still tucked into his ample sleeves
the chinaman came straight to his matter
without preamble

 how much you want suppose you go
away go tonight no come back
watson looked at him quizzically he
seemed to find a certain humor in the
situation

  you got a stake tucked away chu-chu
and you want to buy me out hardly
likely i think you are talking for amos
where is he

  asleep i give him something make
him sleep how much you want

  i dont sabe this chu-chu are you
offerin me your own cash

 maskee how much

  cunning showed in watsons eyes and
the swift lick he gave his lips with his red
tongue

 lump sum

  no you stop along san flancisco i
got fiend in san flancisco he belong hop
sing along of me you see him evelly
month he pay you

  watson drew himself together reflective
striving for full clarity to consider the
proposition

  no he said shaking his head sagely
it wont do chu-chu i can get all i
could ever get out of amos by stayin here
i like it here im goin to cash in he
wants me out of the way before tomorrow
the girl comes tomorrow im goin to see
if she looks as good as her picture sabe

if she does-

  he licked his lips again

  you think you mally her

  maybe i wont-have to-mally-her
laos eyelids slid back into the eye orbits
without wrinkling for a moment he let
watson look fairly into his eyes save for
their slight slant there was little difference
between them and watsons all were
black and behind the black pupils some-
thing seemed to leap and peer in murky
flame but laos voice was silky

  i think you go all same he said

  you do

  watsons face was beginning to purple


adventure

with congested blood manifested in little
networks of broken veins

  you get out of here chu-chu while
youre all in one piece you tell amos ill

see him in-first before i get all that i

want him livin like a king for years and
me scratchin for a miserable twenty-thou-
sand-just to lose it

  you take twenty-thousand can do

  no ill see him in-first

 maybe maybe suppose he wantee
look-see he find you there

  it seemed to watson that lao chu was
deliberately irritating him he thrust out
his under lip and drew down his heavy
brows losing his control

  so thats it is it

  lifting his pistol he aimed it at laos
forehead his finger crooking to the trigger
threaten me will you

  mo betteh you no shoot said lao
composedly

  his hands were out of the sleeves now
hanging loose-fisted at his sides they
displayed no weapon

  you look outside you see boy play fan
tan you see light in window those boy
all belong along my tang all belong along
hop sing seclet society me i am masteh
in hop sing suppose you shoot suppose
you kill pistol make too much noise they
come i think you hang

  watson laid down the pistol lao could
see him tensing for a spring there was
nothing but brutality in his face the will to
kill

 make too much noise eh thanks
make too much noise you yellow devil
well then

  he launched himself from the bed his
bare toes scuffling the rugs as they aided his
leap his great hands open to clutch laos
throat lao stepped back a little bracing
himself he could not escape the rush of
that human avalanche it seemed as if
he was not trying to avoid it as watsons
hands cruelly gripped him compressing his
wind-pipe the long fingers of laos right
hand looking as if they were carved from
ivory clung for a brief moment against the
skippers hairy chest then they closed
as if spasmodically squeezing the poison-
ball

  watson never felt the prick his next
heart-beat pumped the venom through his
system without a shudder he collapsed
lao chu straining all his strength to ease

the big inert body to the floor then he
padded down to the ground floor went out
through the back offices and crossed to
where the houseboys gambled

      perhaps lao chu had not taken
into calculation together with his
opiate the exhausted general con-
dition of coyle it was mid-morning before
the latter awakened and saw the sunshine
sifting in through the slats of his jalousies
he rang instantly for lao before he saw that
the latter was seated at the foot of the bed

  what time is it why didnt you wake
me dont you know what day this is

  i sabe today missy come back i fix
cloton bed for her

  where is watson

  he was off the bed still dressed save for
coat and shoes fumbling with the latter

  weve got to get rid of that beast avis
will be here before noon why did you let

me sleep chu now-

  he unlocked and opened a drawer taking
out an automatic releasing the clip lao
crossed to him putting a hand on the gun

  maskee he said maskee watson
he go

 go where

  i not know but he go long way no
come back

  coyle dropped the gun and took lao by
both shoulders glaring into his eyes

  how do you know did you see him
i speak with him lele while las night
and he go i say good-by along of him
long time befo sunlise

  then hes gone to fetch sparks and
belcher he threatened to last night i-
god help me-i tried to bluff him

  lao cleared his throat contemptuously
huh long time i know spahk and
belcher dead they dlown i sabe that
long time ago along some fliend come from
samoa watson he plenty lie sup-
pose-

  there was the sound of a motor horn jubi-
lantly pressed coyle tilted his blind slats

   its avis lao-

  maskee lao chu answered suavely
with the term that in china has so many
shades of meaning and application for the
english of it doesnt matter i go down
i speak you fix up lele i speak you shave
coyle watched him leave with his wild
eyes slowly softening to hopefulness still
tinged a little with incredulity then with
the gray charteris



hands that shook he began to lather and
prepare to shave

 hello lao wheres my daddy-cap-
tain youve moved the crotons are they
planted yet

  all plant plant um this moning befo
sunlise all same misteh mcglego he speak
along you fatheh you fatheh he jus
shaving now

  the girl was out of the motor her stalwart
young fiance beside her both ardently in
love unashamed to walk hand in hand
round the house to see the transplanted
crotons lao chu followed beaming an
oval twelve feet by eight was filled with the
crimson black-veined leaves they were
glossy enough but they seemed a little wilted
are you sure they will grow lao

   quite sure missy they all lightee by to-
night i put plenty numbeh one fehtilizeh
along of them i think your fatheh he come
now

  coyle was coming down the steps of the
south lanai to the garden avis left her
lover and ran into his arms

in his room lao chu replaced the
frangipani in the ming vase in front
of the picture of avis coyle with a
spray of huapala vine not unlike honey-
suckle but of the deepest gold the native
name means sweetheart and lao chu knew
hawaiian well

  he renewed the punk sticks in front of his
gilded joss then he brought out another
bowl of black porcelain and set it before
the gilded god in this he also set a
spray not of flowers but of laurel
shaped leaves that looked as if they
had been newly varnished leaves of
crimson thickly veined with black leaves
of croton

  there are many strange things placed
on the shrines of heathen gods

ray charteris

a four-part story part c

robert impon

author of the other allingham gifford the giftedetc

the first part of the story briefly retold in story form

an the banks of the benin river in the niger
delta were sprawled the buildings of marsden
 cos trading-factory across the way stood the
dccrepit establishment of the only rival in the
vicinity which belonged to bart jardine and his
daughter a distance down-stream rotted what was
left of a concern once known as grandisons and it
was to this latter beach that charteris a man with
silvery hair and the face of a youth came appearing
no one knew why or whence

  the gray charteriscopyright  by robert simpson

  

  at the same time hugh morrison owner of mars-
den  co arrived in his yacht with his daughters
and servants to look over his agency and investigate
the circumstances surrounding a disturbing quarrel
between two important native traders agwala and
abado his visit had not lasted more than a few
days when one pitchy night as he paced the deck
of his boat mr morrison was done to death by a
mysterious assailant and immediately the neigh-
borhood of whites and blacks was thrown into an


adventure

uproar every effort was made to determine the	vanished during the confusion but even mor-

murderer and during the proceedings of inquiry	risons own daughter elsie was subjected to a

suspicion fell upon every one from the puzzling	grilling and it was her nervousness and bewilder-

stranger charteris to noni margaret jardines	ment that created a new air of suspicion and served

negro maid and next abado-who had incontinently	to complicate the whole affair all the more

chapter ix

abado decides

 i he atmosphere in the library had the
temperament of a lucifer match even
elsie sensed its crackling consistency the
moment she entered the place and that she
was accompanied by charteris did not serve
to relieve the tension

  with a murmured apology charteris
slipped over hogmanays feet and behind
malketts chair and reached the great
danes side before any one quite grasped
the fact that he was there

  miss morrison was rather frightened by
your official aspect he said to parker
sotto voce but i convinced her there was
nothing to be afraid of mind if i take a
back seat

  not at all if you can find one

  the great danes voice had an unaccus-
tomed rasp in it his patience apparently
had been severely tried in the past half-
hour and a glimpse of malketts glowering
countenance and hogmanays solemnly
dour expression was sufficient to indicate
that under abnormal circumstances trade
and government had been indulging in one
of their frequent plainly worded criticisms
of each other

  catherines cheeks were pale her eyes
hard and her mouth gave the impression
that it would be some time before she would
smile again even when elsie went over to
her she acknowledged the girls presence
simply by putting a protecting arm about
her waist

  margaret jardine appeared to be torn
between sympathy and something approxi-
mating anger or indignation or both and
captain walton who evidently repre-
sented the yachts share in the responsi-
bility for the crime stood a little to
margarets right leaning a shoulder against
the wall and trying to make his little
button eyes take on a semblance of
austerity

  arthur garriman bark stood facing the
commissioner at the back of the court
and noni who squatted on the floor at

margarets feet watched him and charteris
alternately out of the corners of her squirrel
eyes

  she alone of all the little company ap-
peared to be the least affected by the turn
of events her little feet were carefully
tucked out of sight under her print over-
cloth the gaudy silk handkerchief about her
head had been arranged just so and nothing
on earth was more guileless than the simpli-
city of her expression

  charteris did not find a chair but stood
in the corner near the screen door to the
right of hogmanay who had risen to offer
elsie his seat the girl had no opportunity
to accept it because it was then that parker
said as pacifically as he could

  there is no need to be afraid miss
morrison this isnt a court-room and i
dont want you to feel that you are on the
witness stand or anything official of that
sort we are trying to get at the facts of
the case as amicably as we can his smile
was somewhat strained and i want you
to help us as far as lies in your power just
stay where you are and try to answer the
questions i put to you as simply as pos-
sible a pause i understand you were
playing cards in here with mr dillingworth
when it happened

 yes over there where sandy-mr
macgregor is standing

  how long was it after your suspicions
were aroused before you went out on deck
elsie hesitated and catherines arm tight-
ened about her waist i really dont know
dads whistling stopped so suddenly it-
it frightened me tommy-mr dilling-
worth and i waited to see if it would begin
again perhaps a minute perhaps only a few
seconds then i ran out because i couldnt
stand it any longer and before id got more
than a few yards i saw a faint black heap

on the deck and-

  all right gently did you hear any
other sound after the whistling stopped
no that was what made it so terrible
a splash perhaps

  no nothing

  i see the great dane paused bet-
ter take a sip of water he advised and
the gray charteris



when catherine had poured some from the
water-cooler on the desk into a glass the
girl drank a little as if she thought she were
making a public exhibition of herself then
parker asked-

  did your father ever take you into his
confidence in matters of business

  elsie looked startled and catherine was
on the verge of an objection but apparently
thought better of it

  why no

  you remember of course the visit chief
agwala paid your father at forcados did
you by any chance learn anything of what
was decided upon on that occasion no no
dont be alarmed that visit of agwala has
important bearing on the cause of your
fathers death or rather we believe it has
and i simply want to know if you learned
anything of the circumstances attending it
from any source whatever did you
elsies bewilderment was altogether con-
vincing she did not have the faintest sus-
picion of the provincial commissioners drift
and her reply in the negative was almost
unnecessary

  not even from mr dillingworth

  no nothing at all

  all right thanks i think that is all
  it was

every member of the bonnys
crew from captain walton down-
ward had been questioned by mal-
kett or bark or both within the past few
days and it had been proved as nearly as
it could be proved under the circumstances
that no one on the yacht had seen morrison
die or had any visible reason for encom-
passing his death

  nothing had happened since malkett had
come on board to alter the assumption that
the thing had been done from without on
the contrary evidence had been forthcoming
that provided sufficient reason to believe
that morrison had been murdered because
of his own conception of ethics in business

  having questioned catherine tommy
dillingworth and elsie the great dane was
now reasonefbly convinced that none of
them knew anything of what had transpired
between the late king of west african trade
and agwala at forcados but because
hogmanay had dourly persisted in conceal-
ing his knowledge of it there had been a
war of words in which the business methods
of the deceased had inevitably come in for

some uncomplimentary scrutiny and criti-
cism on the part of the government

  this had not pleased catherine and she
had said so without troubling to remember
that she was talking to the representatives
of the law

  hogmanay of course had become only
more stubborn than ever and the fact that
parker had purposely given the morrison
faction an opportunity to be frank with the
government if it had anything to be frank
about before he called upon the ultra-mys-
terious noni to say anything at all was the
most irritating circumstance in the whole
affair parker spoke directly to catherine
and captain walton

  i have no reason to believe that the
whole ships company has not been per-
fectly honest with us in every detail my
friend macgregor isnt a member of the
ships company so we wont hold the
character of his information against you

  captain walton answered parkers smile
but catherine ignored it completely he
went on quite calmly however

  if one knows anything of the native
mind in its relation to a case of this sort
one knows also that nothing is to be gained
by white people mincing matters among
themselves then to margaret jardine
quietly-

  when was it the girl first came to you
and said she was afraid of the government

  naturally every eye turned toward mar-
garet as though parker had thrown a spot-
light upon her and the scuffling of a hausa
policemans naked feet on the deck outside
was plainly audible in the second or two of
silence that waited upon margarets answer

  the evening after mr morrison was
killed she said simply when i left here
to return to the hulk she seemed nervous
and ill at ease and when i finally asked her
what was wrong she told me the govern-
ment men had frightened her

  did she say why they had frightened
her

  no i imagined at the time that since
she had been here with me in the midst of
so much excitement she had just been
frightened by the seriousness of everybody
and everything and particularly by the
government officials who had of course to
question everybody on board

  did she say that any one had questioned
her

  not then for several days i noticed
ioo

adventure

that she was acting rather queerly and
then last night mr bark came to the hulk
and she ran to me and begged me not to
let him take her away

  bark smirked but no one paid any atten-
tion to him no one except charteris who
watched him more closely that he did any
of the others not excluding noni

  and then what happened

  mr bark explained to me that he had a
few questions to ask noni and that he had
no intention of harming her in any way i
told her not to be silly-she was hiding be-
hind my back at the time-and to answer
mr barks questions if she could

  he spoke to her in jakri and i could not
understand what was said but apparently
he got the answers he wanted and when he
went away noni seemed to have relieved
her mind of a considerable weight

  she would not tell me what mr bark
had said to her except that it had something
to do with a family palaver and then this
morning you sent a messenger asking me
to bring her here and that i think is all i
know about it

  thank you have you any reason to
believe that the girls testimony is not to be
trusted

  not any less than that of any other
native

  nor any more

  no she is only a child but her sim-
plicity is far from being everything it seems
to be

  parker nodded and noni who had not
understood a word of what was said about
her made even catherine relax by choosing
that moment to yawn quite audibly the
great dane looked toward bark

  all right go ahead but dont frighten
her

  if the presence of charteris bothered
bark now his self-control was highly com-
mendable without stirring from his place
he accepted the center of the stage with a
slight lift of the shoulders and spoke to
noni in jakri gutturals that sounded almost
tuneful the girl looked at him then at
charteris grasped margarets skirt a mo-
ment and rose slowly to her feet

  bark explained to her in jakri that he was
going to ask her several questions in english
and instructed her to answer them in
english for the benefit of the commissioners

  the whites of nonis eyes showed promi-
nently then but in a very few seconds she

was nonchalantly leaning most of her weight
on the arm of margarets chair while the
sole of one small naked foot absently scraped
the instep of the other

  you be abado daughter

  yessah

  which man want you for him wife
plenty man all time noni returned
complacently

  yes but-you savez doridi

 eh-heh doridi be big man for
agwala-- doridi beg me be him wife long
time

  whats matter you no marry doridi
noni shrugged her shoulders most expres-
sively

  he no good for me my father no like
him all same he be agwala man my
father no like agwala

  them las time doridi look you he want
you be him wife

  eh-heh be so he talk all time

  what other thing he talk them las
time

  so-so trade palaver

  what he say

  he say mas morrison go fix abado
proper

  how doridi savez dat

  he be big man for agwala all same
agwala and mas morrison talk for
forcados little bit pass agwala talk for
doridi softly softly all same catchee
monkey

  catherine looked rather bewildered so
margaret explained whisperingly that
agwala had taken doridi into his confidence
immediately after his talk with morrison
bark went right on	v

  what thing doridi tell you mas morri-
son go do to fix abado proper

  he say mas morrison go pay abado
so-so little bit price for him oil and kernel
so he no fit to trade for marsden beach he
say mas morrison go make abado lose
plenty big money so he be sinall-boy sobo
again and no fit to bodder agwala no
more

  whats matter doridi talk so he no
savez you be abado daughter 

  he savez he tink so abado go like
him little bit suppose he tell him what mas
morrison go do he tink ot go be him
wife one time

  what you do them time he finish talk
i tell him he be fool noni admitted
blandly so
the gray charteris



  and she snapped her fingers

  only elsie laughed a feeble nervous
sound that threatened to crack

  what thing doridi do them time you
tell him he be fool

  he go way

  which place he go

  he go for market

  how you savez dat

  neither catherine nor elsie could follow
nonis reply to this question and in truth
the girls pidgin english was so involved
that even the great dane had to make her
repeat parts of it but reduced to its sim-
plest form the answer contained the several
facts that at a near-by native market noni
had passed doridis information on to
abado largely because she was afraid not
to and that she had preceded doridi to
within whispering distance of abados ear
by something less than an hour

  which day all them thing happen
bark asked

  be eight day pass

  how you member dat

  six day pass me and missy capn jar-
dine go for marsden beach be two day
pass dat

  just the faintest hint of color tinged mar-
garets cheeks but it drifted again s
parker turned to her and asked-

  do you remember miss jardine if this
girl was absent from the hulk for any length
of time last wednesday

  yes she left in the late afternoon and
returned next day

  you are sure of that

  quite she told me she wanted to talk
to her father about a palaver of some kind
as a rule she is only too anxious to keep as
far away from him as possible

  parker nodded thought a moment or
two glanced toward hogmanay who was
stroking his beard in a sort of relentless
reflection then mumbled something to mal-
kett who rose and went quickly out beckon-
ing bark to follow

  bark followed but because hogmanays
unmoving bulk insisted upon it he had to
pass charteris at closer range-as would
have been obvious to any one on the deck
outside-than he cared to

  i think thats all ladies and gentlemen
the great dane was saying pleasantly
enough as the tips of barks fingers touched
the screen door but if any of you
have anything to add that will substan-

tiate the girls testimony ill be glad to
hear it

  nevertheless bark heard quite distinctly
what charteris said to him in passing he
hoped no one else did and the fact that he
could not be sure of this made him feel
decidedly uncomfortable all the way to
marsdens beach

  when malkett and he stood on the top
step of hogmanays stairs-on the exact
spot where abado had elected to die if such
a thing could be allowed in such a place-
arthur garriman bark had a sinking feeling

  where n - is he malkett de-
manded wrathfully

  arthur did not know then or later

  abados canoes and oil and boys and
women still clustered the breakwater but
abado himself suspected of planning the
murder of hugh morrison had apparently
decided to die elsewhere

chapter x

the wisdom of the tortoise

tn the cool of the late afternoon when
charteris paddled leisurely up-river to-
ward grandisons beach again the excite-
ment of the morning on board the bonny
had died down to a low and spasmodic
drone

  abado had vanished he could not be
found but as his guilt had been estab-
lished beyond peradventure by his sudden
disappearance there was little more to be
said or done in the matter until he was safely
laid by the heels in the barracks at warri
or sapeli

  everybody that mattered knew now why
nonis evidence had been so important it
not only divulged the reason why abado
had instigated the murder of morrison-r
and no one who knew anything about the
sobo believed that he had actually done
it himself-but it also definitely established
thfe most important fact that abado had
known of morrisons intentions in relation
to himself in plenty of time to give him the
opportunity to strike in his own defense

  not even hogmanay doubted the dam-
ning quality of nonis story after the full
weight of that final truth had descended
upon him none knew better than he that
the deed was worthy of the sobo that it was
typical of abado to go straight to the root
of trouble and destroy it at its source


adventure

  hogmanay however persistently refused
to commit himself cannily evading the issue
by saying that he would wait for advice
from the liverpool office but even
catherine who occupied a deck chair a
foot away from the great dane as charteris
crept up-river in the shade of the over-
hanging bush was reconciled to the belief
that if justice were to be done it would
be impossible to be too squeamish about
revealing the motive for the crime

  it was not an easy pill to swallow but
catherine who knew how to smile when
she lost by a six-inch putt on the last green
knew also how not to swallow bad medi-
cine in the presence of the multitude

  she was in fact in a rather apologetic
frame of mind because of her open antago-
nism of the morning and since the great
dane was under the impression that he
had been perhaps just a little too official
and too impatient with her point of view
under the circumstances they both watched
the departure of charteris upon an equal
mental plane

  hes terribly odd catherine remarked
or oddly terrible im not sure which
yes but i believe he is really an
awfuliy good sort

 why do you know him

  only slightly

  i didnt know any one had ever seen
him before where did you meet him 

  i didnt parker responded truthfully
then added by way of explanation his
credentials are perfectly all right and the
natives i understand regard him as a kind
of god

  yes i could see that even rattail
at lunch seemed awed and he is a kroo-
boy a hesitant pause i suppose his
credentials are strictly private

  oh yes quite

  followed a lazy silence in which the
great dane assured himself that he was
not allowing catherine to soften his attitude
toward her too much

  when he had first met her at forcados
he had come to the conclusion that it would
not be advisable to meet her too often that
was why he had refused the dinner invita-
tion she had extended to him just a few
minutes before he was going to start back
to warri as soon as he had had an oppor-
tunity to question chief agwala personally
arthur garriman bark was due to return
with agwala at any moment

  margaret jardine also had been compelled
to leave more hurriedly than catherine had
hoped there were unbelievable trade
canoes alongside the hulk and bart jardine
had sent a kroo-boy with a chit that in-
quired briefly and bluntly if margaret were

going to spend all her time with those-

morrisons

  hogmanay had seen the trade canoes be-
fore margaret did and when she had gone
he had returned to his own beach on a
business pretext and was at that moment
playing the land o the leal softly and
mournfully on the fiddle to him the
canoes about the hulk marked the beginning
of the end of the combination and the
defeat of his hope that margaret would
leave before the dry season ended

  charteris bothered him too the man
knew far too much and always said too
little and although he had intimated his
intention to go ashore with hogmanay he
had not done so the supplies he wanted
so he had said could wait till later hog-
manay thought it would be as well one of
these days to pay grandisons beach a
visit

  catherine had the same thought elsie
of course had had it before either of them
but unlike her elders she had not kept it to
herself

  i cant understand catherine persisted
how a white man can possibly live like
that a gentleman i mean one would
think that the filth and the general incon-
venience of it would cure him of the experi-
ment in a week

  does seem rather insane the great
dane admitted i know i shouldnt care
to try it and ive done my share of bush
travel but he seems to prove that the
thing can be done if a man has enough
inclination to do it the most vivid impres-
sion i have of him too is that it actually
seems to amuse him

  yes doesnt it

  then as fran and elsie who had been
joined farther along the deck by tommy
dillingworth and captain walton became
audible on the subject of the slowly vanish-
ing guest catherine added with a smile
im afraid fran-miss goddard-doesnt
like him he isnt obvious enough and she
always did hate anything that would not or
could not explain youre quite sure you
cant stay for dinner surely the affairs
of state can afford you the time to eat
the gray charteris

properly which i know you cant do on that
launch of yours

  well-you see-that is really very good
of you but im afraid i should have to
leave drinking my coffee on the way down
the companion ladder

  then well have dinner half an hour
earlier and save your dignity

  i havent any i was thinking of my
manners out here we have to try to
preserve those so that we wont have for-
gotten by the time we go home again how
to eat in public

  i dont believe you ever forgot the how
of anything once you had really learned it
parker laughed being a normal human
being he liked to be told that there was
something super-human about him of
course he had known at forcados- con-
found memories and experience why
couldnt they let a man drift if he wanted to

  ive forgotten what synecdoche means
he admitted in a drifting voice and if i
didnt just vaguely remember that napoleon
or alexander-im really not sure which-
had something to do with a place called
arbela im afraid id have forgotten
whether it was a battle or a ladys name
that isnt important and it isnt what
i mean catherine rose suddenly im
going to order the cook and rattail to
serve dinner at seven will that give you
time to drink your coffee like a gentleman
liqueurs too

  the liqueurs have it parker said and
catherine liked the way he grinned at her

  yet when she went along the deck to
announce the altered dinner hour officially
to captain walton her glance traveled up-
river to where a one- woman canoe moved
idly on toward grandisons

charteris however had ap-
parently forgotten that the yacht
and everything pertaining to it
existed neither did he pay any attention
to the faster moving canoes that gave him
as wide a berth as possible as they passed
him by his single-bladed paddle rose and
fell indolently and his expression indicated
an unflattering indifference to his kinship
with men both white and black

  when he reached grandisons tumble-
down gig-wharf and tied up his canoe there
was no sign of ogulo the dwarf anywhere
upon the premises everything was peace-
ful to the point of being uncomfortable and

charteris ambled up the weed-grown path
to the house without so much as a glance
at the scurrying lizards that vanished be-
yond the ragged lime hedges at his approach

   as he climbed the stairs he looked down-
river for the first time since he had left the
yacht and halting a few minutes watched
agwalas forty-paddle canoe swinging past
marsden  cos factory toward the bonny
then he went on again turning to the right
when he reached the veranda

  ogulo met him just inside the door of
grandisons office

  he live sah he whispered and there
was a bewildered sort of reverence in the
dwarfs face as he backed away

   all right

  charteris moved across the room to a
corner in which there was a little heap of
folded blankets above the blankets was a
crudely made mosquito-curtain frame that
in the day time looked like a canopy and
gave to that corner a throne-likeeffect

   that he had gone to the trouble of erect-
ing the frame indicated if nothing else that
the truly fiendish ravages of the benin river
mosquito affected him upon a par with all
mortals also that he expected to make
benin river his headquarters for some little
time

  he squatted in the corner fumbled be-
hind the blankets a moment and produced
a tin of cigarets

  go bring him he said to ogulo as he
discovered a box of safety matches in his
shirt pocket

  yessah

   and presently trailing after ogulo like
a soul in bondage abado the sobo came in

      the sobo traders demeanor had
uti undergone no change since the morn-
ing if anything in the presence of
the gray man who never hurried his eyes
became more dull and his knees sagged as
though his legs would fold up under him
at any moment his raiment still consisted
only of a loin cloth

  when charteris indicated that he might
squat on the floor if he cared to and ordered
ogulo to go out to the veranda to watch the
trend of events on the river abado gravely
sat down with his arms wrapped about his
knees and ignored the departure of the
dwarf completely

  when the python is hungry the monkey
climbs higher and is still charteris began


adventure

in the sobos own jargon and when the
leopard hunts the bush dog creeps the long
way round but the elephant goes his way
without thought of anything but man

  the gray man has the wisdom of the
tortoise abado admitted humbly to a spot
on the floor he speaks and all men
listen it is good to be the gray mans
friend

  in seven days abado the elephant has
become abado the bush dog charteris
went on unheeding his eye is like a
smoking lamp and his belly is lean and
empty his skin is like the white mans
roads before the rains come and his legs
are but dry sticks that any small boy may
break and agwala laughs till his fat
shakes like a tree in a big wind is abados
wail of death to be the sound of the jakri
mans laughter

  the sobo shuddered and his arms tight-
ened about his knees convulsively but his
chin sank lower until only the top of his
round crinkly head was visible to charteris
he had nothing whatever to say

  when agwala said that abado was the
son of the mother of pigs charteris con-
tinued calmly turning the knife in the
wound the gray man thinks the jakris
tongue spoke truth and when abado
hangs at the end of the white mans rope
agwala will see abado hanging there and he
will say to his wives and his sons in a voice
that will reach to warri the little pig is
dead for many moons its squealing
sounded like the voice of a man and we
were afraid but it was only a very little
pig after all 

  a sobo guttural of anguish escaped abado
and his head lifted wildly charteris laughed
at him

  the little pig tries to speak like a man
he taunted but it is only the cry of a small
boy in the dark abado the elephant is
dead and his spirit has found shelter in a
leaf that is ready to fall it will blow here
and there on the wind until the rains come
and beat it into the ground then the leaf
will rot and the soul of abado the elephant
will be less than the soul of the little pig
the jakri man will see hanging from a
mango tree on the white mans beach

  the sobos bloodshot eyes peered at
charteris through half-closed lids he ap-
peared suddenly to take a really intelligent
interest in what charteris said and present-
ly he asked in a hoarse whisper

  why does the gray man say that abado
will hang from a mango tree on the white
mans beach all men have said that the
gray man is wise and that the black man is
his little brother but never have i heard
that the gray man was a witch-doctor who
spoke of things to be

  only a fool speaks of tomorrow char-
teris told him and watched his every move-
ment much more closely than abado im-
agined

  then it is today i will hang on the white
mans beach

  today if the hand of the white mans
law touches you before the sun dies

  cha the sobo leaped to his feet
stirred to a semblance of his old fighting
self does the white mans law hang even
if a black man has not raised his hand
the white mans law is life for life
charteris said simply

  eh-heh abado approved and broke
into pidgin-english in his excitement be
good i like him all same he talk so
morrison die you die palaver set
abado stared he also gaped even the
most simple of monosyllabic exclamations
was beyond him

  charteris expression was purposely one
of bland indifference as if he did not care
whether abado had killed morrison or not

  but the sobo was not satisfied with indif-
ference of that sort obviously the informa-
tion staggered him and it was plain that
his amazement was genuine also as soon
as he could make himself understood in any
language it was clear to charteris that he
was going to deny having had anything to
do with the murder

  and then it came in a flood sobo and
jakri and pidgin-english all mixed inextri-
cably together a cry of innocence at first
indignant then fearful then a whimpering
childlike burst of pleading for charteris to
believe him his fear of the white mans
law was as pitiful as his belief in charteris
wisdom and sense of justice was apparently
profound finally he descended to his knees
and bit by bit crawled toward charteris in
abject surrender of both body and soul

  i beg you i no do him i no savez
which man do him i beg you

  charteris permitted him to go on pleading
until he was something less than a yard
away then with a gesture halted him and
asked in sobo-

  when abado sat on the white mans
the gray charteris



stairs and made ready to die who asked him
to come away

  the gray man spoke to my son etaji
by the mouth of ogulo the dwarf and i
came away

  how many times did i speak by the
mouth of ogulo the dwarf

  abados glance shifted apologetically
three times he answered in a barely
audible whisper

  three times charteris repeated with
an edge on his voice and if abado had
made me speak a fourth time abado would
not have been on the white mans stairs
to hear

  the sobo looked up quickly his expres-
sion the sharpest kind of question-mark

  because the hand of the white mans
law would have touched him charteris
informed him and my message would have
been spoken to a thing that hung upon a
tree at the end of the white mans rope
abado understood perfectly again his
chin sank slowly upon his breast and his
whimpering was stilled charteris looked
around for his cigaret tin

  when i talk he said in pidgin-english
i talk once and he held up one finger
savez

  yessah without raising his head

  all right belly hungry

  yessah

   charteris rose

             chapter xi

thirty puncheons

the jardines dined late that evening
also the next business was so per-
sistently brisk as to be suspicious and cap-
tain bart jardine when he saw so much of
his shelf-worn stock disappearing over the
hulks black sides had little difficulty
in convincing himself that virtue even
in the niger delta has its ultimate
reward

  it wasnt abado that killed morrison
he told margaret almost every time he
scurried into the sweltering shop-saloon
where she paid out cargo at an alarming
rate it wasnt any man black or white
it was the hand o god

  then bart would wax religious and point
several morals to adorn his discourse con-
cluding always with the assurance that he

was right and knew he was right-if he

didnt

  margaret was too busy to pay much at-
tention to her fathers volubility and there
was an aspect of the sudden rush of business
which she thought he was disposed to over-
look

  few if any of the traders who took pay
for the oil and kernels they delivered to
jardine were familiar to margaret cer-
tainly none of the benin river traders
were among them and margaret had the
impression of a decidedly foreign element
descending upon the hulk in a frenzy of
buying and selling that would die out as
suddenly as it had begun

  margarets duties were equivalent to
those of a shop clerk on any delta trading
beach she paid for the produce bought by
her father from the native trader and
since the akerri had become wedded to her
mudbank and the purposes of trade the
saloon was no longer a place in which
to eat

  it was a shop fitted with long low
benches on which were displayed print
and madras and real india-eight yards
to the piece-gorgeous silk handkerchiefs
singlets shirts and a scattering variety of
european clothes generally

  beneath the benches and the erstwhile
dining-table the lower two-thirds of which
was the principal display counter were
small bags of salt and rice iron pots of all
sizes machetes that were always called
matchets hammers axes hogshead to-
bacco lanterns and lamps canned stuffs
cheap perfumery yellow soap and the
unnumbered other commodites imported
by the white trader for the purpose of en-
couraging the natives ambition through the
medium of his stomach and his vanity

  otherwise the saloon scarred and pock-
marked by time and the impulses of
rough-tutored men was a place of sodden
memories that joined hands from the
mersey to the beaches of old calabar

  in the right-hand corner directly facing
margaret whose desk was the captains
place at the head of the dining-table-the
corner where one of the little wall-bracket
lamps hung in crumpled ruin-one of the
akerris first officers had been shot in the
throat by the second mate because he had
robbed the latter of a girl while on shore
leave in hamburg the first bullet had
smashed the bracket lamp and the late
io

adventure

captain ed jardines only comment on the
episode had been

  just an ordinary girl too cheap as a
packet of pins

  on the reverse side of the picture a young
spanish songstress of las palmas who had
an ambition to perform in madrid had sung
the akerris former skipper out of the price
of her ticket depriving him at the same
time of a considerable measure of his respect
for his own good common sense he had
never been very keen about that story and
margaret had always suspected that ro-
mance had touched him that night as a
straying wisp of the spanish girls black hair
might possibly have brushed his cheek

  sometimes in the light of the white-
shaded oil lamp that hung over the table
margaret could see the girl sitting there
leaning forward carmine lips olive cheeks
a touch of red against the black of her
cheap tinseled gown her big dark eyes alive
with eagerness and a haunting anxiety the
pulse in her white throat beating furiously
as she sang

  perhaps it was not in the least like that
but margareft preferred that version it
made the story so much softer than most
of the other tales the uninviting little saloon
could tell

  and with the steaming swamps of the
deft all about her with the relentless sun
overhead with the daily doses of the in-
evitable quinin and the raw and literally
naked elements of life brushing elbows with
her at every turn it was more than merely
good to look upon the bright side of things
it was absolutely necessary

  at dinner on deck on the evening of the
second day while the mosquitoes hummed
incessant chorus about her ears and the
hosts of flies and moths made a gray-black
shade around the stand-lamp margaret did
not even pretend to be listening to the
various reasons why morrison had been
struck down and why captain bart jardine
was one day on the wings of honest pur-
pose going to fly higher than morrison
had ever done

  while she was trying to interest her
palate in the various items on the menu
which the accra cook insisted upon putting
into writing and which always concluded
with an ornate rubber-stamped god save
the king she was hoping that the flurry in
trade would last long enough to dispose of
her fathers scanty stock also that before

he could replenish it or even indent for
another bale of cloth or a single head

of tobacco the hulk would fall apart or
become defunct in some equally decisive
fashion

  some such contingency as far as mar-
garet could see constituted her only hope
of escape

  i aint goin to get no more of that
turkish red kind o two-piece cloth her
father informed her suddenly from the
other side of the dining-table just as she
finished her coffee and was preparing to
rise it too bloody makes them nig-
gers think too easy of fightin and murder
and that aint good for them they think
of them things too easy as it is

  maybe ill stop selling matchets too
theyre ugly weapons to put in an igerant
black mans hand without no guarantee as
to what hes goin to do with them of
course theyve got to have some kind o
knives to make canoes and such but them
matchets is too much knife in my opinion
what do you think

  margaret knew that it did not matter
what she thought he would do what
he pleased in any case she knew also
that the casual listener would have laughed
just then however for some irritating
unaccountable reason she was further
from laughter than ever and she thought
that if she had to spend many more days
such as that had been in the swelter of the
shop-saloon she would see much virtue in
violence or profanity or both

  aint you got a tongue her father
demanded since she did not answer quickly
enough to suit him here im work in
myself to a shadder to make a fortune to
jthe gray charteris



keep you out o the workhouse and you
aint got interest enough to answer me
when i talk to you

  if id ha took your advice id ha sold
out to morrison when all the fates was
workin to do to morrison as he done by us
and now that im reapin my reward youre
sorry hes dead and spend your time-my
time-lickin the boots of them daughters

of hiss if they was ever one-bit sorry

for us when we were on our uppers and not
doin a bushel of trade a day

  aint i your father aint i done my
best to bring you up right given you a good
schoolin and sweated my life away on them
stinkin gin boats just for to make you
independent and you aint got no more
gratitude than a kroo-boy and dont do half
as much to excuse yourself for livin
thats what i says first and last and i

knows im right too-if i dont

  then suddenly speaking past margarets
left elbow--

  well who the-are you and what

are you doin on my ship without an invi-
tation

charteris came out of the
shadow of a deck-house into the
light of the stand lamp avoided col-
lision with a startled kroo-boy steward who
stood on margarets right and came to a
halt with his seedy-looking panama in his
hand midway between the girl and her
father bart jardines long scrawny neck
was stretched to its utmost and his popping
blue eyes glinted like glass marbles

  sorry ive interrupted you at dinner
captain charteris apologized but i
thought nine oclock late enough to avoid
making that kind of nuisance of myself
we are at least an hour late margaret
admitted and did her best not to seem
amazed at his sudden appearance can
we offer you anything i can vouch for the
deviled chicken and weve got the only
cook on the river who can prepare saratoga
chips he used to be on an american
cable ship ever taste them

  you aint said who you are bart
jardine interjected before charteris could
answer or what youre doin aboard my
ship after dark my daughter aint the
captain here if youve got anything to
say for yourself report to me

   glad to captain charteris said affably
my name is charteris and my business

here at this unseemly hour is partly a little
matter of trade in which i think you will be
interested but principally a desire to be

friendly

  turning toward margaret whose eyes
had clouded and narrowed at the mention
of trade he added-

  but for the fact that i dined sumptu-
ously less than an hour ago id be glad to
pass judgment on your cook and to prove
it if you will extend the invitation to an-
other occasion ill make a point of bringing
my appetite with me

  margaret smiled but her father eyed his
visitor with a dull appraising stare

  trade eh you a trader i never
seen or heard of you afore

 i dont doubt it and i must confess
i am not a trader just dabbling in it
meantime for the fun of the thing and
thought i could throw something of in-
terest your way

  he looked about him inquiringly

  may i find myself a chair and smoke
jardine grunted an ungracious affirma-
tive swore at a steward just to indicate to
charteris that he was the captain on his
own ship then said pointedly to margaret
as charteris possessed himself of a deck
chair and dragged it into the light

  you met him afore

  yes as calmly as she could under the
circumstances

  where

  at marsdens and on the bonny

  huh hobnobs with them fellows
does he and then comes down here at this
hour to talk trade and be friendly why
aint i heard o him afore this you aint
said nothin about meetin him and he
aint ordinary enough lookin to forget
about

  he turned his head and took another good
look at charteris who had just seated him-
self a little to the left of jardines chair and
was searching his pockets for a cheap gun-
metal cigaret case

  i dont know as i want to talk to you
mister your recommend dont sound
good to me and ive got a lot of indentin
to do come back to-morrow and then
maybe well see

  dad margaret was on her feet in a
moment you dont understand mr
charteris is a gentleman and you have no

right to insult him simply because-

  insult are you talkin to me sit
io

adventure

down and shut up this aint your affair
im handling it and if you aint satisfied
you can get out ivetold you that afore

and im tellin it to you again -if i

aint

  he turned sharply toward charteris only
to start back with a throaty gasp of as-
tonishment

  charteris was at his elbow looking quietly
down at him

what the-	v

  thatll do jardine i dont like theat-
ricals particularly now and here how-
ever since miss jardine has been good
enough to defend me the least i can do is
to return the compliment

  jardine laughed foolishly he leaned
back in his chair sidewise either to get a
better look at the other man or to get as
far away from him as he could the
kroo-boy chief steward and his two assist-
ants edged instinctively nearer to margaret
a close observer might have seen that the
scar had taken on a faint red hue that
came and went like the beating of a pulse

  if you are really serious about not
wanting to talk to me charteris added
calmly i shall be glad to withdraw but
if you are only bluffing it isnt at all con-
vincing and-well your coffees getting
cold

  he backed to his chair and sat down again
without even a whisper of protest from
jardine who just as he always did when
margaret found it necessary to pound him
into submission subsided like a pricked
balloon aside from mutterings that were
intended for his own ears alone he said no
more until the stewards had removed the
coffee cups then he managed to muster
enough courage to ask charteris whether
there was anything he would like to drink

 thank you captain no not at
present

  and when the stewards had cleared the
table and removed it and themselves from
the scene charteris added as he matter-of-
factly placed a deck chair for margaret
just a few feet from his own

  theres some oil i think you can have
if you care to raise your price a little
thirty puncheons thats worth a bit
more than usual isnt it

  thirty puncheons jardine said it
dully

  he had not bought that much oil all at
once since he had stepped into his dead

brothers shoes margaret murmuring a
word of thanks for the chair charteris had
secured her looked at him more narrowly
than ever	a

  yes a job lot i imagine it might be
called

  then seeing how margaret regarded him
charteris laughed

  no i didnt steal them neither did
the man who owns them i can vouch for
that if you want them i think i can
induce him to bring them down the
only stipulation he made was that your
usual price would have to go up a bit
thirty puncheons eh jardine re-
peated dubiously and no gin in the pay
i imagine so he knows you dont sell
the stuff 

  whats his price

  jardines voice was husky with anxiety
i havent the faintest idea youll have
to talk that over with him

 how do you-

  oh i just happen to hear of things like
that now and then charteris interjected
smoothly and having met miss jar-
dine i thought you might be interested
enough to meet this fellows terms

  who-who is he

  etaji a sobo trades at sapeli most
of the time i think probably you never
heard of him

 no he aint familiar to me you
ever hear of him margret

  margaret shook her head the whole
thing sounded unusual to her and she was
trying with all her might to guess what
charteris ultimate objective was

  and where do you come in jardine
asked charteris suspiciously aint you
got nothing to say about the price

  not a word the oil isnt mine he
laughed of course if you are afraid it
isnt clean business or something of that
sort etaji can take his oil to siluko

  oh it aint that jardine declared
hastily i was just wonderin thats all
at this point margaret explained to her
father who charteris was what he did or
rather did not do and where he was resi-
dent at that time jardine eyed him
after that in a more subdued frame of
mind than ever nevertheless after he
had asked him again to have a drink and
been again refused jardine ordered one for
himself and at the same time became
obsessed with a brilliant idea which he
the gray charteris



advanced hesitatingly but with increasing
resolution

  maybe if you was tc bring me some
more trade like that at the regular price i
could pay you a commission

  why dad mr charteris isnt-

  now just leave my business to me
margret i dont need you to help me
run it if hes got anything to say let
him speak for hisself hes got a tongue o
his own aint he

i think so charteris admitted and
your idea seems to me to be quite good
how much trade can you handle captain
as much as you can bring in jardine
retorted challengingly

  youre sure of that

  well now jardine hedged i aint
sure o nothin cept death and taxes as the
fellow said and maybe on account o slack
times my stock aint as full as it might be
but that aint here or there now im
goin to do a lot o indentin as i said and
i was just tellin margret i was thinkin i
wouldnt sell no more matchets because o
them being too dangerous in the hands of
an igerant nigger

  but i got to think about that a day or
two and maybe powder and lead shot and
them muzzle-loadin uns and such ought to
be left out too i aint in this business only
to make money mister im here to help
them black fellows an not burn out their
stomachs with rotten gin or blow them
full o holes with bits o rusty iron and as

i was tellin margret-

  how much stock have you charteris
asked when he thought jardine had said
enough

  how much well now that-that

aint none o your - business as i can

see you bring me the trade and ill
pay for it even if ive got to pay cash
cash isnt what they want margaret de-
clared on an impulse and wondered if char-
teris really could or would do what he said

  she was sure that to him her fathers
proposal was a huge joke and that he was
playing with it just to amuse himself for the
moment

  it aint eh jardine demanded who
asked you to say what they want or dont

want if i says theyll take cash-

  they probably wont charteris inter-
rupted mildly theyd have to turn it
into goods to be able to do business in their
own markets however never mind about

that now when your stock runs out you
cant take any more trade thats simple
enough

  it aint goin to run out im goin to

indent-

  all right thats settled then very
seriously as gola brought jardine the
drink he had ordered better begin in-
denting at once hadnt you

  im goin to and well talk about the
commission ill pay you when i see what
kind o trade you send me i aint buyin a
pig in a poke at my age

  i dont blame you at all charteris said
and rose when jardine did good night
captain

  gnight dont break your neck goin
down my companion ladder

  margaret silently escorted charteris on
his murky way to the top of the companion-
ladder and arriving there she paused

  why are you doing this she asked
quietly

  perhaps i am doing it because i am
mercenary charteris suggested

  i dont believe that but in any case
i hope you do it

 why

  because-oh i might as well be truthful
about it for once im tired of it

  how astonishing such a nice old boat
as she is too youd like to sell out and
shut up shop

  margaret laughed nervously

  id go further than that if i had any
dynamite

  i thought so cooking yorkshire pud-
ding and picking strawberries would be
better than changing piece cloth into ker-
nels and eating liquid butter perhaps--
of course this is only a suggestion-if you
were not so anxious to conceal the curl in

your hair-

  margarets breath caught sharply she
could not see charteris face very well in
the dark but she knew he was not smiling
his left hand leaned lightly on the rail his
right held his hat he showed not the
slightest disposition to be familiar mar-
garet laughed

  i didnt know that i exhibited any kind
of anxiety she said feeling shaky in her
absurd embarrassment and the curl
might not stay curled

  still i do not have to elucidate

 i-i dont know perhaps youd
better
no

adventure

  charteris shook his head

  isnt necessary just think it over
he held out his hand good night miss
jardine

  margaret gave him her hand with some
hesitation it was an altogether new ex-
perience for her to be afraid of any man yet
she was in no wise relieved when he started
down the companion-ladder to his canoe
because the fear was not physical there
was an uncanny sensation of being lifted up
-out of oneself-without warning and
then of being dropped back again without
any compunction so suddenly that it
jarred

  yet as she watched the vague shadow of
him vanish into the black outline of the
bush she could not help feeling that in his
own queer way he liked her and wanted to
help she walked to her deck cabin still
tinglingly conscious of the touch of his
hand

  her first impulse was a mirror there-
fore her second lacked enthusiasm it was
more prosaically a cook-book she had
never cooked yorkshire pudding

charteris heard the light
splashing sound behind his canoe for
a full minute before he paid any
heed to it

  then turning his head and seeing a small
dusky hand grip the canoes tail he said in
a low friendly voice

  all right noni hop in no man look
you now

chapter xii

two cases in court

tm afraid i am a vulgarian noni
a charteris said confidentially to-
night i have descended to the mean level of
trade advised a woman to get married and
held her hand for at least three seconds
longer than was necessary that is the
inevitable danger of having anything to do
with mine own people theyre a senti-
mental breed soft and their influence
is correspondingly degrading

  i no savez noni said respectfully

  she was kneeling dripping wet like a
shiny black goddess of the waters on the
tail of the canoe and though her tone was
tractable enough it was evident that she
had no liking for the performance

  whats matter abado want me to do so
missy capn jardine go make palaver for

me

  thats highly probable but duty my
child is the grandest and sternest word in
our language and there was simply nothing
else for it

  i no savez noni said again a little less
respectfully my brudder say abado
want me to do so all same abado go die
he talk tru

  absolutely

  noni did not understand that either
and though she persisted in trying to dis-
cover why one of her numerous brothers
had visited her late that afternoon to in-
struct her to leave the hulk in so unusual a
manner charteris did not become any
more explicit as he paddled his slow way up
river toward grandisons

  he glanced toward the dim lights of the
jpcht as they passed and beyond them he
noted that a lamp burned in hogmanays
office swift and black the river raced
between and phantom-like canoes slapping
lazily by gave forth but little sound of life
save the occasional grunting of an overfed
paddle-boy

  grandisons was in darkness but ogulo
was on the gig-wharf when charteris
reached it and the moment the latter step-
ped ashore followed reluctantly and dubi-
ously by noni the dwarf whispered
govment man come

  which govment man

  bark i look him he go way maybe
so he come back i no savez

  what- a pity i should have liked to
have seen bark he look you

  no sah

  charteris turned to noni who had been
eyeing ogulo with warranted suspicion
wet cloth no good we go get blanket
the girl followed without demur and in
a few moments she was wrapped from
neck to heel like an indian squaw in one
of charteris blankets when ogulo had
lighted a small kerosene lamp and placed it
on the floor of the room which charteris had
claimed for his own noni squatted near it
and waited placidly for the next move

  apparently she knew of no reason why
she should fear any hurt at her fathers
hands certainly she did not know that
she had been brought there to be put on
trial for her life

  while ogulo went in search of abado
the gray charteris

hi

charteris stepped on to the veranda to keep
a watchful eye upon the river he hoped
that the light of the lamp would induce
arthur garriman bark to return it would
undoubtedly be much better for arthur to
come to him than he to be compelled to go
in pursuit of arthur

  ogulo found abado in the galley also
abados eldest son etaji a big raw-boned
sobo naked above the waist and as unemo-
tional as an owl

  they had spent an unhealthy hour dodg-
ing bark and though abado appeared to
have taken a new if sullen lease on life he
wore his overcloth much as noni wore her
blanket and having partaken of both food
and drink his manner suggested that the
latter had consisted of a drop too much of
palm wine

 he made no comment when ogulo ad-
vised the arrival of noni but etaji who
also had been too intimate with a demijohn
greeted the announcement with a grunt of
satisfaction and hurried eagerly up the
rickety galley stairs abado preceding
ogulo followed solemnly and leisurely after

  the moment noni lifted her big squirrel
eyes and saw etaji come so silently and
swiftly into the room she knew that his
intentions were far from amiable his un-
emotional owl-like look was gone in its
stead was a bristling desire for violence
that in simple truth was too inflamed by
palm wine to wait for a more fitting oppor-
tunity his pleasure at finding noni alone
was a hideous thing

  nonis mouth opened but the sound she
made was immaterial unable to reach her
feet quickly enough because of the trailing
length of the blanket she crouched away
from him gapingly intent upon his eyes and
hands

  etaji did not raise his voice he stood
over the girl and in a low waspish mono-
tone hurled sobo epithets at her head
cursing the jakri mother who had borne her
as efficiently and completely as he could in
the time at his disposal

  then as the scuffling of abado and
ogulog naked feet came to his ears his
rage suddenly mounted to a wild fanatical
frenzy and as swiftly as a conjuror pro-
duces a rabbit from a hat he snatched from
the folds of his overcloth an ugly broad-
bladed hausa dagger

  noni screamed the sight of the naked
steel loosened her voice and etajis lunging

body made her stupefied muscles stir
enough to allow her instinctively to roll
away from him

  etaji struck and the blade sank into the
folds of the blanket with sickening ease
fortunately there was none of noni in
that part of the blanket though she was
momentarily pinned to the floor some-
thing like a pig in a sack etaji had lost grip
on the haft of the knife as a result of his
furious eagerness and ere he could recover
himself there were encircling arms about
his waist

  they were not nonis arms she was
only half-conscious when etajis floundering
weight was removed from her head

  the arms were ogulos and they were
wound about etajis waist like the coils of a
constrictor lifting him up and up until the
small of the sobos back was hugged against
ogulos barrel chest then the dwarf
grinned etaji with what breath was left
in his body screeched in agony

  abado stood in one doorway charteris
in the other both saw the hausa dagger
that pinned nonis blanket to the floor so
perilously close to nonis head they
saw etaji kicking his legs in mid-air-
glimpsed his protruding eyes his pain and
terror as he shifted his head this way and
that-and charteris saw ogulos grin
all in the space of a few seconds

  charteris barked an order that filled the
room with a low sharp thunder but
ogulo-of-the-long-arms had not killed a man
in many moons and surely this man should
die to him charteris voice was but a
whisper and he paid no heed

  presently he thought when the feebly
kicking legs of his victim would cease to
kick he would lift etaji higher than his
head and hurl him from him again and
again till his broken body no longer
squirmed or twitched then would etaji
be forever damned-just as he was

  in the midst of these promising prognos-
tications ogulo felt a hand fasten itself in
the nape of his neck while the vagrant
thumb of another hand searched for and
found his left eye

  a split second later ogulo stood upon
his toes a harsh guttural of pain leaping si-
multaneously from his throat he dropped
etaji with a suddenness that would have
been as unpleasant as it was inconvenient
if etaji had been in any condition to know
anything about it


adventure

  the sobo lay where he fell and as
ogulo flung up his hand to tear charteriss
excruciating grip away from his face
charteris made no effort to contend the
possession on the contrary he released
ogulo so quickly that the dwarf was wholly
unprepared for the next move

  just a little shove a single step backward
a flying but accurate right toe and ogulo
sprawled across etajis unmoving form
without let or hindrance

 he did not stay down neither did
charteris second attempt meet with quite
as much success ogulo was too far
away-and going he went down-stairs
four at a time his shadow of a soul shrink-
ing almost to nothingness in a fear that
drove all thought of man-killing out of his
stunted body it sent him down to his
post on the gig wharf with a horrible sensa-
tion that the gray mans eyes were burning
holes in the middle of his back

  charteris however did not follow any
farther than the top of the stairs then
with a light and wholly unmusical laugh he
went back to his room again to find abado
bending inquiringly over etaji

  noni having pulled the hausa dagger out
of the blanket and the floor stood shrink-
ingly in a corner holding the ugly weapon
tightly in her hand as though prepared for
anything

  charteris simply held out his hand and
the girl glancing furtively past him toward
her father and her now feebly stirring
brother relinquished the knife into his
keeping without a word he quietly or-
dered her to sit down and set her the ex-
ample by seeking his corner and seating
himself among his scanty possessions to
which he added the knife as a matter of
course

  finding himself a cigaret he said to
abado through a cloud of smoke

  etaji finis when he fit to walk he
walk home palaver set

  abado raised his head slowly altogether
sobered by his sons startling attempt to
take the law of the family into his own
hands he glanced at charteris ignored
noni completely then looked heavily down
upon etaji again

  he finis i savez palaver set

  and that was all

  he rose and choosing a spot on the right
of the room midway between noni and
charteris sat down folded his arms about

his knees and waited for etaji to recover
of his own accord no one spoke char-
teris finished one cigaret and lighted an-
other noni huddled in her blanket
watching her father and etaji out of the
corner of her eyes

  presently her brother staggered wildly
to his feet drawing deep and tortured
breaths into his lungs he stared unbe-
lievingly at noni searched inquiringly in
the folds of his overcloth for the absent
knife then because his legs weaved uncer-
tainly under him he lurched against the
nearest wall for support

  charteris said to him after a minute or so

  etaji finis go home palaver set

  etaji did not understand that at first
so charteris repeated it and abado con-
firmed it by paying not the slightest at-
tention to his sons protests and pleas

  when etaji was convinced that sentence
had been passed upon him he flung himself
at abados feet groveled whined beat his
forehead soundly upon the floor tore at his
crinkly hair and generally indicated that if
the light of his fathers eyes did not shine
benignly upon him life was well lost for
him had he pleaded with a stone image
he would have received as much satisfac-
tion and finally charteris ordered him
simply and concisely to shut up and get out

  etaji departed with moaning lamen-
tations he trailed from the room and
down the galley stairs cogitating sadly on
the evils of palm wine and his ever too-
hasty knife-hand

  without a further word of comment upon
the matter charteris turned to noni and
asked her to give him her closest attention

  this was not so easy the girl could
still hear the low hum of the vibrating
knife blade as its point was buried in the
pitch pine floor within the fraction of an
inch from her ear a sound like that in the
circumstances under which noni heard it
is likely to interfere with all other sounds
for some little time

  nevertheless when charteris began to
speak noni listened in less than a minute
she heard nothing but the simply con-
structed sentences that fell from his
tongue and it was not that the voice had
any hypnotic effect it was simply the bur-
den of what he said

  briefly he explained to her the position
in which her evidence given before the
provincial commissioner had placed her
the gray charteris

ii

father he further made clear the cir-
cumstance that abado being a fugitive
from justice was fleeing not only from the
governments officers but also from his
enemies

  agwala would be only too anxious to
assist the government in its search of
abado and plausibly enough deliver him
up more dead than alive

  noni stared her eyes seemed to grow
bigger and bigger every moment as she
gapingly appreciated abados situation
she realized it so well after a while that she
looked upon her father fearfully as upon the
shadow of one who was already dead

  agwala was great agwala was rich
agwala never slept

  and abado was in his hands between his
finger and his thumb like the broken shell
of a ground-nut

the darkness beyond the light of
the little lamp deepened percep-
tibly vague night sounds upon the
river seemed to become muffled in a moment
she knew now why etaji had struck

  her tongue innocent of any evil inten-
tion had betrayed her father into almost
unescapable danger and there was but one
sequel to that etaji drunk on palm wine
had tried to consummate that sequel

  but he was only the first the others
would not be so precipitate nor so careless
and noni had too many relatives to escape
the vengeance of all of them at once and
in a frantic haste she crawled nearer to
charteris

  i no savez govment palaver them
bark man say he be abado frien i think
he be big man for govment and no fit to lie
he talk sweet mouf too much

  she glanced toward abado but he had
nothing to say charteris also was silent
but noni was quick to appreciate that his
sympathies would be more surely reached
than those of her father and she crawled
still nearer with the evident intention of put-
ting herself definitely under his protection

  i talk true i no savez them bark mans
sweet mouf talk i be small so-so girl
i no savez govment lie palaver

  charteris nodded coldly noni smiled
it was a pitiful little smile something like a
watery glint of sunlight when the black
tornado clouds are making all things
scurry for cover

  but she stopped edging nearer to the

queer gray man who had a small-boys face
she knew that she had gone as near as she
dared knew it without knowing why and
even then she wondered vaguely if missy
capn jardine or the white mammies on the
white ship would ever go any nearer

  but that was not why she smiled she
had crawled up to the gates of a hope and
found them barred fear sickening and
terrible raced down her spine to the soles of
her little feet and shook her lithe young
body as death shakes thp lean frames of the
very old and yet noni smiled

  men have earned the victoria cross for
lesser deeds of valor than that 

  then nervously and pitifully alternating
between pidgin and sobo and speaking as
as child speaks when it is confronted with a
mystery she told charteris again that be-
cause arthur gawiman bark was a govern-
ment agent who had claimed that the
government had always been friendly to
abado she had believed him she had
trusted him more surely when he pointed
out that if it had not been for the white man
abado would still be a small boy

  the white man bark had said had given
abados genius for trade a chance to express
itself had protected him at all times and
prevented agwala from harming him
the white man therefore was unquestion-
ably abados friend and in the matter of
the alleged boycott of which bark had
heard whisperings the white mans govern-
ment was anxious to protect abados
future in trade 

  he bark was the representative of the
white mans government consequently
he too was abados friend there could
be no doubt about it it would be to
abados interest if noni would tell the
truth to the big commissioner

  at this point abado raised his head and
looked searchingly at his daughter evi-
dently he was considerably astonished at
the trend her defense had taken and she
stopped speaking as though the look he gave
her had put a clamp upon her tongue

  charteris remained impassively indiffer-
ent ostensibly he was content to leave
nonis fate in her fathers hands

  and amid a silence so deadly that the
chattering of nonis perfect little teeth
was painfully audible abado rose slowly to
his feet then to nonis everlasting sur-
prize he said to charteris simply if
cryptically-
h

adventure

  the lie is brighter tharfthe light on the
white mans ships

  abado referred to the search-light carried
by some stern-wheelers

  abado the tortoise speaks charteris
returned sonorously aparently under-
standing what the sobo meant did not
the gray man say she had no evil on her
tongue

 the gray man can look at the sun at
noon abado admitted generously its
good for the head to think before the edge of
the knife is sharpened on the stone
abados eyes are young again char-
teris encouraged soothingly they are
like a bush cats in the dark

  the big sobos great shoulders squared
and his head lifted he began to pace up
and down the floor like a caged animal
emitting low growls of resentment against
captivity

  noni much to her relief could feel herself
drifting into the background of events and
charteris who knew that abados mental
development along certain clearly defined
lines was little more than that of a child
allowed him to indulge his conceit for
several minutes without interruption then
he asked pointedly-

  is the voice of one the voice of many
times ten

  abado halted he was not at all sure of
the answer

 and is agwala the rain and the wind
and the heat of the sun that abado should
cower and shake and sweat with fear

  a sobo expletive was the reply to that
and with a sudden movement abados
overcloth came down from his shoulders and
descended to his waist to be fastened there
in a savagely made twist-knot that ex-
pressed in all probability what he would
do to agwalas neck if he ever had the
opportunity

  agwala is the empty voice of the tom-
tom he said and with an added expression
of contempt that was unprintable and
which relegated the jakri chieftain into the
uttermost depths of inconsequence he
turned toward noni and regarded her
heavily for the longest minute of her young
life

 the gray man has drawn your throat
away from die edge of the knife

 nonis heart thumped wildly but she
uttered no sound neither did she move
nor even glance in charteriss direction

  go back to the white mammys ship
noni hardly believed her ears she
knew perfectly well that that judgment was
not abados

  and remember that your tongue and
your eyes and your ears are the gray mans
till you die palaver set

  noni said doh respectfully then rose as
abado turned his back upon her she
glanced toward charteris and knowing that
her life virtually had lain in the cup of his
hand she was thankful enough for the
mercy of his intervention

  but perhaps it was then that noni-of-the-
little-feet actually became a woman she
did not extol charteris for his wisdom
nor did she thank him for saving her from a
bush dogs death with her head a little
on one side and giving a tilt of indifference
to her chin she said casually

  i tink so my cloth be dry now i go
look him be all ri

  charteris nodded if he had smiled he
would have forfeited much of nonis re-
spect and when she returned from the
veranda where her overcloth had been
hanging on the rail to dry she gave him
back his blanket and asked simply-

  i go

  again charteris nodded then he said
in a low tone

  you go live for hulk sofly sofly
when abado man come dere you no savez
nothing you no talk for abado man lil
bit when govment man come dere you
be all same your tongue done die but
when agwala man come dere-you talk
sweet mouf and have plenty big ear
bark be agwala man savez

  noni did and started perceptibly she
glanced quickly toward abado who had re-
sumed his restless pacing of the floor but
found that he was not even interested

  i savez she admitted to charteris in a
low voice

  all right suppose you be proper big
ear for gray man he member noni long
time ogulo go take you for hulk in my
canoe tell him be so i talk he live for
gig-wharf

  noni went out and down the stairs to-
ward the gig-wharf in a daze

  she was still the daughter of abado but
was evidently under the jurisdiction of the
gray man who did not like women and
bark was the agent of agwala

  these were things to think about
the gray charteris

h

    ogulo who was sitting on the gig wharf
 when noni reached it did nothing to dis-
 turb her thoughts he had been cheated
 of a life that had surely belonged to him
 and having recovered somewhat from his
 fear of the gray mans eyes he was thinking
 sorrowfully of his wrongs and nursing an
 inflamed left eye at the same time

    he accepted with a grunt the instructions
  noni gave him and appeared to welcome
  the opportunity to get away from his ob-
  servation post if only for a little while
  the fact that noni was possibly the most
  attractive girl of his own color on the river
   did not seem to occur to him and he made
  no reference to the murderous attack etaji
  had made upon her

   noni did not encourage conversation
 seated behind him on the silent and cau-
 tious journey back to the hulk she thought
 of her wrongs too and of how the happen-
 ings of the night would affect her future or
 what there was left of it

    she was but one of abados many daugh-
 ters off-hand it is doubtful if she could
 have told how many half-sisters she had
 and she acted as margaret jardines maid
 principally to avoid coming prominently to
 her fathers daily attention

   now she would be in his thoughts every
 hour and though the gray man had saved
 her from a vengeance of blood abado
 would not forget

   because she was her mothers daughter
 he would sell her without thought of her
 worth to some small-boy sobo trader
 whose price would be but little whose
 wives laden with brass would be of the
 sobo breed and who would expect her
 sons to be sobo

    nonis quick black eyes seemed to retreat
  into her head when die thought of that
  her flesh chilled as though a harmattan
  mist had come suddenly down from the
  north and she became acutely conscious
  of the fact that she had bones

   then and inevitably she thought of
 arthur garriman bark and her mood
 changed as swiftly as ogulos ape-like arms
 rose and fell her eyes burned like live
 coals and her savage revengeful little heart
 rose up into her throat in the impotence of
 her voiceless fury she was caught in the
 jaws of a trap and arthur garriman bark
 had set it the result was neither pretty
 nor promising-for arthur

    ogulo grinned he did not even have to

turn his head to know that the edge of her
rage was keen he could hear the grating
of her teeth

  and when he had slipped noiselessly
under the hulks rope-ladder he whispered
insinuatingly up to noni as she began to
climb on board

  the anger of little arms is like a broken
paddle

  a moment later the hard sole of one of
nonis little feet descended ungratefully
upon his nose and he sat down in char-
teris canoe so suddenly that it almost
capsized when his eyes were free of the
involuntary tears that sprang into them and
he could see clearly again noni had
vanished

  ogulo however merely grunted des-
pairingly brought the canoe around with a
single sharp twist of the paddle and headed
up-stream

  even though a jakri man was poor and
accursed without sheep or goats or slaves
to sacrifice and do him honor he did not
waste the precious breath of life in rage
against a woman	

chapter xiii

queer business

arthur garriman bark did not

-	return to grandisons beach that eve-
ning but the matter did not rest there

  malkett himself decided tc stroll in upon
charteris two days later and the bonnys
rail was lined with excitement when the
government launch came frothing back to
the yacht

  the excitement subsided like a pricked
balloon however as soon as malketts
expression was clear enough to be under-
stood though he had nothing to say it
was plain that his journey had been alto-
gether fruitless

  catherine who had acquired an appear-
ance of grim inquiry in the past few days
and who was determined she would not be
ignored followed malkett into the library

  didnt you see him she asked without
mincing matters and giving but little
thought to such considerations as official
reserve

  malketts grin was sour

he offered me a cigaret and a drink

  but why should agwala accuse him of a
thing like that if-
ii	adventure

	malketts eyes halted catherine abruptly
and she had a momentary feeling that he
thought she was being too inquisitive

  you never can be sure why these fellows
say the things they do he replied pa-
tiently enough

  then you dont really believe it

  i believe everything i see miss morri-
son when im sure my eyes are in good
working order up there i saw nothing but
the charteris man and an ugly black dwarf
who appeared to be installed as charteris
house-boy

  catherine nodded dubiously whether
she was relieved or sorry was not clear

  of course-of course you did not tell
him what agwala said

  hardly

  all right thanks i-that is-i dont

want to seem impatient or-

  i know that malkett interrupted with
a heavy sort of sympathy im going to
have another talk with agwala to-day and
-well well see

  is he coming here

  malkett nodded

  three oclock

 oh-er-thank you

  catherine went out on deck and loitered
a minute or two near the rail as if the
somber-appearing cargo boat that had come
up from forcados that morning were of
absorbing interest to her then she joined
fran goddard who was curled up in a deck
chair expressing her profane opinion of the
crawling heat and the savage glare of the
sun

  i think my eyes are getting woozy she
told catherine at once and perhaps i
ought to wear blinders or something but
my sight isnt so defective that i cant see
whats wrong with you youre beginning
to look like tommy dillingworth

  dont talk rot

  as she found a chair catherine added
quietly-

  -	agwalas coming back this afternoon
is he thatll be interesting i like to
watch him roll up the companion ladder and
roll down again for heavens sake dont
stare like that you look as if you
had just choked on your daily portion of
quinin

  catherine glanced slowly up-river she
gave at the slightest heed to frans con-
ception of cheerfulness

  i wonder if agwala lied she asked at

last and straightened dabbing her forehead
lightly with a flimsy handkerchief

  possibly why dont you go up and
find out

  oh rubbish catherine sat up impa-
tiently you do make the most idiotic
suggestions you know perfectly well that
if malkett and bark couldnt prove it i

couldnt

  doesnt follow at all malketts a fat-
head and that bark person is so afraid of
charteris his shoestrings shiver watch
him the next time you get a chance

 but bark went up there the other
night

  yes and came back with the story
that charteris wasnt on the premises
ill bet he knew that before he started
how-

  catherine stopped and waited until the
crinkly uniformed second officer had passed
up the deck forward

  oh whats the use of us trying to
straighten it out

  none in the wide world fran agreed
and studied the jardine hulk for a moment
or two id like to see that thing sink or
blow up or something what did malkett
have to say about your mop-haired friend
nothing he didnt find anything
did he expect to

  i dont know im not sure whether
he believes agwala or not

  catherines glance shifted along the deck
to where tommy dillingworth was en-
gaged in earnest monotoned conversation
with elsie

  those two youngsters are becoming
altogether too sympathetic she added
absently and im certain elsie doesnt
mean a word of it

  of course not she wouldnt enjoy it
so much if she did isnt this heat devil-
ish

  not any worse than it was yesterday
catherine rose suddenly im going over
to talk to sandy macgregor coming
if i dont youll grouse all afternoon
fran returned getting to her feet but pay-
ing more attention to the hulk than to
catherine lord what have we got to
grumble about she asked mumblingly of
no one in particular

 nothing catherine answered and
walked quickly to the rail and looked over
except that malketts gone ahead of us
fran sat down again
the gray charteris



  all right we can wait

  catherine remained at the rail osten-
sibly watching malkett depart in the gov-
ernment launch for hogmanays but
most of the time her eyes were trying to
find some sign of life on grandisons beach

rjg hogmanay had had little to say
since the disappearance of abado

         even when he learned that the
sobos thirty puncheons of oil-those that
had lain so patiently alongside his break-
water-had found a haven in the hold of the
jardine hulk the previous day he merely
grunted and tested the strings of his cello
in a ponderous kind of thoughtfulness that
presaged something akin to lochaber
no more

  jardine might be ignorant of the true
ownership of the thirty puncheons but it
required something more than a fictitious
name to conceal the truth from so experi-
enced a trader as hogmanay

  under the gracious mercy of a gently
swinging punkah he held terse low-voiced
conferences with nondescript natives who
came and went like shadows that moved
sidewise and while they remained their
contribution to the conversation was largely
monosyllabic

  in the intervals between as hogmanay
abstractedly watched the river and the hulk
and the cargo boat that was anchored be-
tween the bonny and the opposite bank of
the river his glance like catherines would
rove every now and then in the direction
of grandisons beach

  but though trade turned upside down
and continued to whirl around in circles he
methodically bought what came his way
shipped his stock of oil and kernels and
rubber together with a sizeable raft of
mahogany logs that had come down from
the nawamba concession and ignored the
cargo boats skippers pointed reference to
the astonishing shipment jardine was
making

  when malkett arrived to make a pre-
tense of growling about the damnable
job of trying to find any one in the hay-
stack of the delta bush drank his whisky
neat and insidiously invited hogmanay to
be confidential and enlightening mac-
gregor looked toward the jardine hulk
and said indefinitely

  aye youre right its a queer busi-
ness but its no a bit queerer than that

than what -

 that batch o canoes that are fussin
 around the hulk like chickens around a
 hen	

 malkett laughed

 makes your teeth water eh

no man no that but it makes
my head keep turning round all the
time

 malkett was not taking the hint when he
 asked pointedly

 well whats your verdict on charteris

now

 you were up there yoursel this morn-
 ing hogmanay returned easily you
 ought to be able to answer that better than
 i can get anything

 nothing

 i thought ye wouldnt

why

 because ive a notion that agwala was
 lyin hogmanay lied deliberately

 yes im afraid so malkett agreed
 and rose hes coming to the bonny this
 afternoon want to come over

 no decisively when i want to see
 agwala ill send for him

 malkett regarded hogmanay for several
 long seconds

 youe so confoundedly helpful he
 said at last youre almost as helpful as
 bark

hogmanay walked noncommittally to
the head of the stairs with his visitor

 if ye happen to be leanin on arthur
 he said quietly dont lean too hard
 thanks shortly  by

 hogmanay went back to his corner and
 continued to watch the hulk and its at-
 tendant canoes

 presently a scrawny jakri boy in a loin-
 cloth came scuffling upstairs to stand re-
 spectfully before him the boy looked as
 if he had been spending the night with
 ghosts his name for simplicitys sake
 was bed

 he dere sah he announced in a ner-
 vous whisper and macgregor could see his
 knees shake

 at grandisons

 yessah i look him

whenj

 morning time sah he go for back
 beach bush them time i look him plenty
 sobo man live for back beach bush sah
 i no fit to come way for long time

 you look gray man too
ii

adventure

  the jakri boy gulped his color was
that of one who was very sick

  i-i fear sah

  toots yere daft wait

  yessah

  macgregor rose and when he had pro-
cured a little gin the boys legs steadied a
bit and his tongue became more sure of
itself

-	i fear gray man sah he ju-ju i no
fit to go for dat place gain all jakri
man fear

  aye i know about that hogmanay
wrote something on a slip of paper this
be book go for shop mas garland go
pay tomorrow time when you done
sleep lil bit we go talk

  i-i fear sah i no fit to go dere
gain

  all right palaver set

  bed went down-stairs looking vastly
relieved and hogmanay once more re-
turned to his corner his brows lowering
heavily

  evidently agwala when he had gratui-
tously informed daniel dane parker that
charteris was sheltering abado at grandi-
sons beach had told the truth

  neither the great dane nor malkett
had shown a disposition to believe it in
offering the information agwala had in-
continently betrayed so decided an antip-
athy and fear of the gray man that his
anxiety to encourage the immediate use of
the governments military arm to rout
charteris out of his stronghold at grandi-
sons had been so palpably a policy of self-
interest that there was little danger of the
suggestion being acted upon

  more than that it had at once suggested
to parker that whatever aid the govern-
ment secured from agwala in the matter of
abados capture would be highly colored
with malice so that it behooved the
officers of the government to move cauti-
ously to keep a watchful eye upon the
character of agwalas activities and to see
to it that the white mans justice was not
tinged with the fat chiefs list for revenge

  hogmanay knew this he believed
also that parker was for some reason or
other satisfied that charteris was simply
an interested spectator in any case the
great dane had gone back to warri with-
out taking any personal action in the mat-
ter and though as hogmanay knew from
experience he was likely to return at any

moment and become excessively active in a
most unexpected direction macgregor was
reasonably sure that the provincial com-
missioner did not appreciate charteris at
his true worth

  and while the jakri boys rather sub-
merged confirmation of this assumption
was conclusive enough it did not from
hogmanays standpoint clarify the issue
in the least in fact it served only to
confuse it

  it was one thing to know that abado was
being sheltered at grandisons beach but
it was an entirely different matter to prove
it for several potent reasons hogmanay
was not prepared to act upon beds evidence
immediately

  malkett who was no fool in an investiga-
tion of the kind had demonstrated that a
personally conducted inspection of grandi-
sons beach unless it was supported by a
company of hausa or yoruba soldiers
would produce nothing and a flourish of
military authority which was of course a
last resort was equally the last thing
hogmanay wished to invite to benin
river

  most important of all however was the
unhappy circumstance that in direct viola-
tion of the momentous forcados agreement
with morrison native trade scouts were
persistently supplying macgregor with the
information that agwala was doing a con-
siderable part of his business with the
siluko and koratown independents on a
credit basis

  therefore hogmanay had every reason
to pause before he placed himself in the
position of playing policeman for agwala
although the evidence against the skulking
abado was strong macgregor was not the
man to move recklessly in obedience to a
blind impulse of vengeance

  undoubtedly charteris had a motive for
affording abado his moral support a motive
that was in some way connected with the
motley group of up-river traders who had
ignored the bwallatown and sapeli trading-
factories to come all the way down to the
jardine hulk

  almost hourly a little here and a little
there hogmanays information was be-
coming full enough to encourage him to give
less and less thought to the mystery of
charteris origin or the reason for his un-
canny influence on the susceptible native
mind
the gray charteris



  he was now principally concerned with
the motives that were behind the man
most particularly as they applied to mars-
den  co the sheltering of abado made
these motives still more obscure and
hogmanay had no desire to be too precipi-
tate or to go fumbling around in the dark

  of course no man could be permitted to
disturb the equilibrium of marsden  co
without coming under the ban of mac-
gregors extreme displeasure but as this
applied equally to agwala hogmanay was
in some doubt as to whom he should tackle
first he thought a little more rope would
not to any harm in either instance

  he was thinking rather grimly of this
when the bonnys launch slipped alongside
the gig-wharf

cath wants you to go up with
her to visit the mop-man fran
announced when she and catherine
had found chairs in the less glaring quiet
of hogmanays office

  i dont want to do anything of the
sort catherine declared i just came
over to talk its so deadly dull doing
nothing

  change places with margaret jardine
for a couple of days fran suggested
turning her sun-helmet over and over
youd boil out all this surplus energy
youre bragging about

  hogmanay grinned

  yere a great sympathizer o margarets
arent ye

  i am and if i wore your size boots
she wouldnt stay in that old rattle-trap
another minute

  eh

  it was catherines turn to smile

  for once i think frans advice is
sound she said meaningly and id like
you to invite margaret to sunday dinner
with us

  hogmanays color was a trifle high but
his calm under the circumstance was
tremendous

  thats kind of involved hadnt ye
better do the invitin yoursel

  we will but we want to be sure it
reaches her

  what do ye mean whats to stop-

  well fran explained elsie and
tommy and i went over yesterday after-
noon in the launch to take her for a run up-
river but she was too busy to bother with

us at least that weird-looking father of
hers said she was heavens how that
man can cuss

  and ye came away without seein her
we had to its his ship and hes the
captain on it he told us so from the com-
panion ladder several times

  i see

  hogmanay searched for his pipe and
filled it and did not hurry

  aye hes a hard man to talk to
he is that

  completing the pipe-filling process with a
deliberation that was fascinating he struck
a match

  theres no sayin what that man is
likely to do or to think but ye mustnt
mind him no a bit since yeve asked
me-though its no my practise mind ye
to interfere in other folks family affairs

im afraid-

  oh light it fran exclaimed nervously
macgregor applied the lighted match to
the pipe puffed deeply and then concluded
with ominous finality-

  im afraid ill have to take it on mysel
to pay the enemy a call

chapter xiv

witness palaver

tn his most pretentious canoe of state
a that swung up from the agwalatown
creek with all the glamour of rhythm and
color that he could inject into the perform-
ance agwala whirled alongside the bonny
to the accompaniment of a burst of pagan
song and the flash of forty stabbing paddles
glinting in the sun

  at the foot of the companion ladder
however his assumption of majesty was
reduced externally to a mere exhibition
of pelf and poundage as fran goddard
had remarked he rolled up as well as
down and as he rolled the bond street
diamonds on his puffy fingers literally
hurt frans eyes

  they are getting woozy she muttered
to herself as she moved away from the rail

  when agwala reached the deck and wad-
dled toward the library where malkett
awaited him it was at once clear that
whatever civilized conceits the chief had
borrowed from his white mentors they had
not altered the man within to any appreci-
able extent


adventure

  though he did not squat in a loin-cloth
before a chop pot and eat with his fingers
but sat at a table and used a knife and fork
though he composed his fat in the midst of
silken cushions on a groaning wicker divan
and knew the difference between benedic-
tine and chartreuse though he wore a
sweeping panama hat and clothed the
upper half of him in a blazer of modest
oxford blue he was still shrouded from his
waist down in many trailing yards of gorge-
ous real india the number of his wives
continued to require three figures and
about his massive neck the red coral neck-
lace with the sacred and all-powerful
cloth-wrapped amulet in the center was
much in evidence

  within that tightly bound covering of
colored cloth was the symbol of the great-
ness of agwalas fathers only agwala
knew what that talisman was and it would
remain a secret even when he died it
never left his neck and never would

  and though all the things that he treas-
ured would probably be buried with him
and would make of his grave a miniature
eldorado not even ogulo-of-the-long-arms
who was already damned would give a mo-
ments thought to the ghoulish reward of
its violation

  as usual agwalas broad shiny fat face
set with small dull black eyes did not ex-
press pleasure or displeasure confidence or
diffidence excitement or a too-inflated calm

  his joy and anger his laughter and his
grief had little effect upon his appearance at
any time when he laughed his fat shook
a little when his wrath mounted his
eyes seemed to flatten but that was all
except in most unusual circumstances
there were few words this apparently
was not an unusual occasion

  doh he greeted malkett jakri fashion
as he scuffed his way into the library with
a bare-legged blue-uniformed warri police-
man acting as an escort

  sit down malkett invited and waved
him bruskly to a chair bark and i went
up there- he jerked his hand in the direc-
tion of grandisons beach-but we
couldnt see anything whats matter

  you go dere with yoruba man

  of course not weve got only your
word for it you no like abado you no
like charteris we go shoot because you
no like

  agwala shrugged his huge shoulders

  if you no shoot chatris sit down for
grandison beach long time and abado be
all same shadow for him

  malkett regarded the blotter in front of
him a little while

  nothing in that he decided whats
matter you no catch abado at grandisons
beach yourself

  agwalas smile was enough of an answer
to that question but he added generously
if i go dere with my boys chatris
man go fight i no want to fight chatris
man if i fight him and he go die white
man law says be me kill him dat no good
and he shrugged his shoulders again
most impressively to put a period on the
whole business evidently although he
was anxious to have the government bring
a company or two of yoruba soldiers to
benin river he had no desire personally
to cross swords with charteris

  half an hour later he was leaving the
yacht and catherine was trying to make
malkett disclose the result of the interview
in sentences of more than one syllable
the best she could get however was a
bruskly mumbled announcement to the
effect that-

  parkerll be back tomorrow

  catherine was glad of that and at tiffin
she mentioned the fact casually to fran and
elsie and added meditatively-

  i wonder why the provincial commis-
sioner is so sure of charteris

  elsie bridled at once

  arent you

  elsie has reached the stage where she
takes it as a personal affront if one questions
whether the mop man brushes his teeth as
often as he should fran explained unneces-
sarily to catherine and you lie awake at
night praying that agwala is a liar shut
up both of you and let me enjoy my tea
im sure tommy wants to second the mo-
tion but he hasnt the nerve to admit that
hes as sick of the charteris cult as i am
tommy muttered something incoherent
and catherine laughed rather absently so
fran added for good measure

  fact is charteris doesnt give a rap
whether you think hes respectable or not
and im perfectly certain agwalas telling
the truth

  elsie gaped but catherine asked quietly-
  why

  because its just the sort of thing he
would do
the gray charteris



  he would not elsie protested hotly
he wouldnt protect the man who killed
my father

  catherines eyes narrowed thoughtfully
but she had no further remarks to make on
the subject

margaret jardine had no
time for tiffin

  the companionway to the little
shop saloon was jammed with shiny loin-
clothed bodies that milled and sweated and
grunted like cattle even the skylight
overhead was black with impatient bushel
traders whose raucous screeching loosed a
deafening pandemonium

  margarets jakri shop boys assisted by
two kroo-boys were working with valiant
and violent energy to keep the shop as
free as possible of all save those who were
at that moment taking pay

  but again and again excited up-river
bushmen who were a long way from home
ducked under the rope barrier or stepped
over it and thrust their booksat marga-
ret jabbering the tale of their haste the
while

   presently margaret found it difficult to
distinguish the difference between a dozen
heads of tobacco and a piece of a certain
dark print cloth also she knew that
things were being stolen and that the
management of the situation was swiftly
passing into hands other than her own

  somehow or other with only a vague
understanding of the fact that the shop had
been cleared and the doors locked she was
standing on the hulks bridge gripping the
rail tightly and looking down at her father
and the dark brown mob that swayed
around him on the deck below

my heads buzzing she said to no one
who could possibly have heard and i

wish youd all go to the--at least for

a little while

   then she heard her fathers voice droning
on and on and there were two glass marbles
sticking away out of his head one on each
side of his nose of course she knew they
were his eyes but they looked more like
glass marbles then than ever almost as if
they would roll down his cheeks any minute
if he kept jerking his head back and forth
the way he was doing

  im tired she said to him and to the
faces about him when his lips stopped
moving and though she could not hear the

sound of her own voice she said the rest of
the words for all that the smells make
me sick and i cant keep those thieves from
stealing when i get to the swimmy stage
then i know its time i shut up shop
so i shut it up and-i think ill sit down
she sat down on a camp chair which oc-
cupied a permanent place on the bridge but
she continued to hang on to the rail while a
cray blackness that was dotted with the
whites of eyes swam round about her in a
most exasperatingly leizurely fashion

  then her father was gripping her arm
she could scarcely see him but she knew
the hard bony quality of his fingers
whats the matter with you

  there was nothing tenderly solicitous
about the inquiry

  im dizzy please go away

  youre crazy thats what all them
books to be paid and all that trade waiting
to be heaved up and youve got to get
squeamish about a little heat an a little

smell you aint half my age and-

  go away margaret wrenched her arm
free and staggered to her feet get off
the bridge get off

 eh who-im captain aboard this

ship and if you aint satisfied-

  get off or ill have you thrown off
jardine screeched in his rage then he
whined then cursed the name of woman till
his breath gave out but he got off the
bridge and margaret stayed hanging
dimly on to the rail

  after a while noni was at her right elbow
and some one who spoke english perfectly-
almost too perfectly-was at her left

  you had better go to your cabin miss
jardine arthur garriman bark said
smoothly you are a little faint and if you
were to allow your head to rest on a some-
what lower level than-that is-your nether

extremities i am quite sure-

  you here again or is this yesterday
im getting mixed

  you go down now missy capn sah
noni asked simply

  margaret thought she would evidently
people would not leave her alone if she re-
mained on the bridge so with barks
and nonis aid though she denied the
necessity for it she reached the box-like
deck cabins that had been built by the late
captain ed jardine for the benefit of his
assistants and himself and lurching into
her own closed the door behind her the


adventure

dark came down without any effort after
that

when margaret discovered that
she was lying in her cabin she knew
also that the mumble of voices
came from somewhere outside her door
they were jakri voices and yet they were
soft-almost sympathetic this in itself
was suspicious

 it had grown dark outside and the
screaming babble of trade had died away
in the shelter of the bush however there
were canoes laden with kernels and oil
waiting for business to resume in the morn-
ing and occasionally margaret could hear
the dull monotoned evidence of their
existence

  she was just a little ashamed of herself
her exhibition of weakness seemed to her
rather pitiful than otherwise and she had
no sympathy for it or for herself

  when she rose and found the deck more
or less firmly under her feet she went about
the task of resuming life where she had
momentarily left off without a second
thought for trembling knees and somewhat
uncertain hands that would pass she
knew she had no fever true her color
was somewhat anemic but-

  she stepped out on deck and stopped ere
she had gone three paces one of the
voices she knew belonged to noni the
other was that of arthur garriman bark
they were hardly more than two yards
distant from margarets cabin when she
saw them evidently they had not sus-
pected that she would recover quite so
quickly whatever it was they had to say
to each other it seemed to be necessary to
say it at close quarters

  nonis cheek was nuzzling barks shoul-
der her large soft brown eyes so childlike
in the confidence they expressed were
looking up into his face and even in the
dark there was no misunderstanding the
amorous intentions of arthur without
any doubt he was agreeably combining
business with pleasure

  noni margaret called evenly and the
haste with which bark drew away from the
girl made margaret reasonably certain that
nonis share of the responsibility for so ob-
vious a denouement waslarger than his

  arthur sputtered hopelessly as if he had
been hypnotized and had been suddenly
wakened up while nonis naked little feet

carried her to her mistresss side without

  faltering in the least

   i here missy capn you besser lil
 bit

   there was no excitement in her voice
 nor even a trace of embarrassment in her
 manner

yes im all right fetch my bath

 water

   yes missy capn sah i do um one
 time bark go way now we talk marry
 palaver lil bit

   marriage is bark going to marry
 you

    be so he talk maybe so i gree i no
 savez marry palaver be big money pala-
 ver i go for bass water one time

    and having thus indicated that the only
 barrier to her marriage with bark was the
  question of the marriage price noni
 swayed leisurely off into the dark toward the
 galley leaving arthur to extricate himself
 the best he could

is that why youve been coming here
every day margaret asked pointedly

   i-miss jardine-i beg leave to protest
 the assertion the-er-the girl has just
 made bark managed desperately i-
 marriage-i had not considered it for a
 moment the girl-our principal witness
 against abado-she has misrepresented the

 facts and i-

    in other words you were just fooling
 your time away

    no miss jardine not at all i-it is
 most difficult to explafn noni-the-er-
 the girl is our principal witness and we are
 assured that she is in communication with
 her father and of course- bark grinned
 as mirthlessly as a deaths head- i-
 that is i am glad miss jardine to see you
 fully recovered

   thanks

our principal witness-i mean i waited
to be sure that i could report to your

 friends on the bonny that-

    dont say anything about it to them
 margaret interrupted shortly under-
 stand

    perfectly miss jardine perfectly i
 assure you again it is a pleasure and a relief
 to know that you are none the worse for
 your most unpleasant experience

    all right good night

   arthur did not hesitate he departed
 from the hulk in the canoe that had brought
 him there and noni watching him from the
the gray chateris



rail in the vicinityof the galley laughed
soundlessly down upon him

  a moment later however she shivered
slightly

  it was not good on the benin river to
make the servants of agwala food for the
white mans laughter

at dinner that evening captain
bart jardine was in the throes of
a period of silence these periods
were rare but when one of them arrived it
was indubitably profound

  margaret did not encourage him to talk
and she was not in the least offended be-
cause he did not inquire after the state of her
health she had appeared at table simply
to indicate that she had fully recovered and
though every so often her father looked
at her rather queerly the silence continued
unbroken to the end of the meal

  after which he retired solemnly to the
nightly duty of indenting for new cargo
and margaret repaired to the shop to make
inventory of the items to be replenished
from the cargo hold next morning

  she was assisted by noni who appeared
to have forgotten that arthur garriman
bark existed and devoted herself with a
fair show of industry to the business of
multiplying by five or ten

  however while noni caressed a flaring
red and yellow silk handkerchief that hung
on a wire immediately above the ver mil lion
perfumery she was supposed to be counting-
margaret leaned on a fast-diminishing pile
of mosquito-bar cloth and considered the
girl attentively

  bark say you lie she remarked finally
he say marry palaver be foolish talk

  noni stopped fingering the silk handker-
chief as though she had been caught in the
act of stealing it in a moment however
her appearance of ingenuousness returned to
her tightening the twist-knot in her
overcloth in a manner that gave her a subtle
indefinable suggestion of modesty and
propriety she straightened and admitted
with disarming frankness

  bark he make me fool me i make
him fool

  margaret did not smile she had no de-
sire to interfere with nonis love affairs but
there was altogether too much mystery
hovering over the hulk these days for
margaret to have much patience with
nonis contribution to it the trade situa-

tion had changed so weirdly that she felt
uncomfortably akin to a receiver of stolen

goods

  charteris had not returned since he had
come to discuss the sale of the thirty
punc ieons but she was reasonably sure
that he was responsible for it all and
wher she had learned from the head shop-
boy who at her instigation had made it his
business to learn it from some one else
that the momentous thirty puncheons had
belonged to abado she had taken the pre-
caution to pray that there was nothing
dishonest in charteris uncanny method of
securing results

  whats matter then bark come here
every day she asked abruptly

  be witness palaver noni answered
smoothly he tink i savez plenty thing
and i no talk

  you savez which place abado live

   no savez noni lied simply

  charteris man be your father friend
i no savez gray man by ju-ju i be
so-so lil girl i fear ju-ju man too much
margaret did not believe that but any
fur tier questions she might have asked
wen stopped by a-descending footstep on
the saloon companion

  macgregors large figure projected it-
self into the light of the moth-encircled
lama without any apology

  hello margaret how are ye your
watch-boy said id find ye down here and i
thought maybe i could take ye up-river a
bit in my gig

  margarets cheeks became faintly tinged
with life as she murmured something about
being busy

  and im afraid dad wouldnt like it
she added with a slight smile hed be
very talkative if he caught you down
here

  then well go up on deck hogmanay
suggested placidly mopping his forehead
this is no a shop its a boiler-room
come on i want to have a real serious
talk wi ye

   that sounds like a threat and i would
rat ler listen to some music

  as she looked around the shop-saloon
appraisingly hogmanay was not slow in
observing that her cheerfulness did not con-
ceal the heaviness about her eyes

  im agreeable to anything that takes
ye out o this fryin-pan for a while he
conceded and margaret without much


adventure

reluctance gave noni her freedom locked
the shop and passed up on deck

  at the top of the companion ladder she
said to hogmanay whisperingly

wait a minute please ill tell dad im
going he would only make it desperately
unpleasant for the watch-boy if i didnt

  hogmanay nodded rather dubiously and
margaret tiptoed aft toward the deck
cabins

in one of these a light burned
and when margeret reached the
screen door she did not open it

  im going over to-

  she opened the screen door quickly and
went in shaking her father by the
shoulder

  dad what is it whats wrong
dad

  captain bart jardines head had fallen
forward on his small writing-desk and
his arms hung limply down so that the
tips of his fingers almost touched the
deck

  dad

  margaret lifted his head sharply and as
she did so she saw the square-faced bottle
of trade gin that stood on the adjacent
washstand

  she looked into her fathers face and then
picking up the empty bottle she slipped
quietly out to the rail and dropped it over-
board softly calling gola the chief stew-
ard she assisted him to place her father in
his bunk

  capn tired too much she said by
way of explanation which did not fool
gola in the least lef him sleep to-
morrow-time he be all right

  then she blew out the light and after a
minute or so in which her handkerchief
became a surreptitious necessity she joined
hogmanay again

  dads degenerating she said with the
tips of her fingers resting on macgregors
sleeve he had no objection to make
so i think ill remain at home do
yot mind if we just stay here and
talk

  hogmanay tried to get at the real truth
by searching her face more closely

  what kept ye so long

  dads time-worn prejudice against trade
gin margaret answered easily im be-
ginning to think hes just a little crazy on
the subject

chapter x

the book o revelations

e havent been over my way in
a long time hogmanay began
when they had found chairs in the shadows
aft the saloon of course yeve been very
busy i could see that

  yes havent we our last shipment
of oil was almost as big as yours

  maybe bigger but i didnt risk the
wrath p an indignant parent to come here
and talk trade

 no

  no ive brought ye an invitation to
dinner- hogmanay paused produced a
chit signed by catherine and countersigned
by elsie and fran and tommy dilling-
worth-and i want to tell ye something
miss goddard-shes an outspoken body-
said to me the day

  margaret carried the invitation to the
light read it laughed and sat down again

  all right the invitation is hungrily
accepted then in mock anxiety it
wont be chicken will it

  ill have a quiet talk wi the bonnys
cook hogmanay promised what would
ye like

  they havent got it margaret declared
emphatically but so long as it isnt chicken
- well what did fran goddard say
she said- hogmanay made a pon-
derously nonchalant job of it-that if she
wore my size in boots you wouldnt be
allowed to stay here another minute
margarets laughter was just a little
hysterical and hogmanay in spite of his
desperate effort to be matter-of-fact was
assuming the complexion of a beet he
took his pipe out of his pocket and put it
back again looked out into the blackness
beyond the rail and into the dark corners
round about as if he expected to find an
eavesdropper in all of them

  what led fran to make a statement like
that margaret asked and tried to be non-
chalant too

  well now-ye see margaret-its this
way have ye ever noticed tommy dilling-
worth especially

  why tommy dillingworth

  margarets hands were held tightly in her
lap because it was going to be harder than
usual to have to say no to what mac-
gregor was so laboriously trying to ask
the gray charteris



  tommy is a young man wi a gift id
like to have this minute hogmanay said
carefully he can speak volumes as the
sayin goes without utterin a word and
not look like a calf when hes doin it if
he were me thered be no need for talking
about it except maybe to suggest- hog-
manay found himself floundering to his
feet-to suggest that the great dane is
allowed to say the words that-thatd make
us man and wife

  it was a big moment in hogmanays life
a triumphant moment but he did not feel
it as such towering over margaret and
looking everywhere but at her he felt pain-
fully out of place

  somewhere forward a kroo-boy was hum-i
ming plaintively to himself and the uneven
scuff of the watch-boys feet on deck came
and went with irritating irregularity

  margaret felt cold even her hands
at first she could see the bonnys lights and
then they became hazy and distant but
there were no tears

  i cant its no use i couldnt leave
him like that-not now

  hogmanay wondered a little at the un-
necessarily high pitch of her voice and laid
his hand awkwardly on her head to quiet
her the result evidently surprized him

  ye-your hairs awful bonny to the
touch margaret he said rather throatily
aye it is that just-just like a silk
hanky

  macgregors accent was becoming as
thick as his voice and there was no re-
sponse so with a terrible effort he tried
again

  im no much o a hand at the richt
thing to say but maybe if yell just let me
try to be guid to ye ill no be so bad a pick
after a

  margaret lifted her face and laughed
a falling sound with a far-off tinkling note
in it that soon drifted away there fol-
lowed another silence as hollow as an empty
calabash

  sit down please margaret said sud-
denly in an amazingly even voice just as
the bosun on the cargo boat faintly struck
three bells

  still more faintly the bonny and mars-
dens beach followed suit and the watch-
boy on the hulk struck four bells just to
prove that he was attending to business
hogmanay continued to stand he was too
excited to sit down

  please margaret insisted quietly
youre too far away up there particularly
in the dark

  hogmanay obeyed reluctantly

  yere goin to begin arguin about it
i suppose he said with a hopelessness upon
him

  no i cant im just trying not to act
like a hysterical schoolgirl and am having
a terrible time of it

  yere a fine lassie margaret hog
manay offered thickly im awfu proud
o ye

  he did not see margaret biting her lips
as she tried to go frantically on

  im not going to blame it on the quinin
or the stuffiness of a twelve hour day in that
place you call a boiler-room i hate the
dirtiness and the heat and the hour-by-hour
grinding monotony of it but that isnt
why-why i would like to let the great
dane say the words i want to belong to
you and-are you terribly sorry i cant
sandy

  macgregor gulped she had never called
him sandy before

  sorry sorrys no the word its not
the place for ye margaret and i was hopin
ye might be willin to give it up thats

awfu selfish maybe but-

  i think its delightful margaret said
luxuriously weve been very foolish for
a long long time you and i

  she reached forth a hand and caught one
of his and for a little while the low hum
of the kroo-boy conversation in the focsle
the even swish of unseen paddleblades
and the ever-whispering tongues of the bush
were the only sounds that disturbed the
awed quiet of a darkness that was grateful
to macgregor

  margarets chair creaked along the deck
just a little

  youll let me fight this thing out in my
own way wont you she asked at last
i know im an awful fool and if you went
away tonight and never came back it
wouldnt be any more than i deserve but
i couldnt be happy even with you if i left
him to go out alone

  yere a fine lassie hogmanay mut-
tered dazedly aye a grand lassie
im not im an idiot and ive al-
ways been an idiot when my aunt used
to take me into the parlor and delivgr ser-
mons to me-and no other room in the
house was good enough for those but the


adventure

parlor-i felt that i was a troublesome un-
grateful little devil for putting her to the
necessity of thinking up all those big words
for my benefit

  then i discovered she just pecked at me
for practise and delivered the same sermons
to her bible class pupils omitting the per-
sonal element and i used to cry myself to
sleep after some of them

 hogmanay patted her hand and she
laughed

  ive-always been that way always des-
perately afraid i was going to hurt some-
bodys feelings or had already done so and
always making excuses for the poeple who
deliberately with malice aforethought
stuck knives into me and it isnt because
i am so filled with the christian spirit its
simply because i havent courage enough
to hew out my own happiness in my own
way

  im a fake you think im good and
kind and patient and self-sacrificing and
im just a simpleton i want to raise the
dickens and-and love and walk off the
hulk with you this minute and never come
back

  come on then im willin

  and i havent got the gumption to do it
im afraid thats the simple truth sandy
it isnt goodness if i had had the courage
to forget some of the ten commandments
id probably have smashed them long ago
to margarets surprize hogmanay
chuckled and his grip upon her hand tight-
ened almost passionately

  aye i ken theres a lot o folk in that
boat but yere fine for a that and if i
get any mair excited ill be talkin like
a drunken ghillie

  margaret suddenly crushed the scar out
of sight in the folds of macgregors shirt
sleeve and after a long pause hogma-
nay announced in a hoarse and hesitant
whisper-

  i-id like to kiss ye margaret

when macgregor returned to his
own beach that night the lateness
of the hour was of no consequence
he sat on his veranda with his cello and
played elgars salut damour so that even
garland who was perspiringly making up
the monthly shop sales paused and listened
and almost became sentimental

 hogmanay followed it with down
south for which his most recently arrived

assistant who was chewing sullenly upon
a cigar and dramatically endeavoring to
forget that he had ever had a love affair
damned him in secret most earnestly

  charteris however rather liked the
second piece

  splendid he declared generously from
the corner of the veranda the last time
i heard down south was when sousa
played it at the glasgow exhibition
hogmanay blinked and put the cello
slowly and carefully away from him  char-
teris came into the light of the stand lamp
without even a suggestion of diffidence or
hesitation

  i heard you fiddling as j went past and
thought id like to enjoy it at shorter range
for a palm oil ruffian you play very well
hogmanay reached his feet mechanically
aside from the circumstance that char-
teris appearance was the last thing on earth
he had expected to happen the mans sub-
lime impertinence fascinated him

 yere an impident -j he said

frankly and in spite of himself a queer
warmth coursed all through him as he
looked speculatively at his visitor or is
it that ye think i am such a fushionless
inconsequential man that ye dont take
any stock o me

  charteris threw his battered panama into
a chair and laughed

  on the contrary i am firmly of the
opinion that you can make more of a nui-
sance of yourself than malkett and bark
and agwala put together but before we
go into that may i have the honor of being
the first to offer my congratulations
macgregors jaw sagged a little

what are ye bletherin about now
miss jardine is a splendid girl char-
teris said and appeared to mean every word
of it and i am only too happy to have
the opportunity to wish you luck in fact

i think a small bottle-

  hogmanay pulled at his beard jerkily to
cover his amazement in his own words he
was fair bumbaized but with that char-
acteristic pride of place which he was al-
ways at no small pains to conceal he lifted
himself bodily to meet the occasion-
boy

 there was no waver in hogmanays
voice

  even on the bonny where tommy dil-
lingworth was saying a lengthy good night
to elsie and fran goddard was assuring
the gray charteris



catherine that the mop man was not
intended to be taken seriously the import
of that yell was distinct and unmistakeable

  sounds like an invitation tommy said
wonder if i could induce walton to go
over with me and keep mac awake

  elsie declared against tommys inclina-
tion to prowl around at that time of
night but in any case hogmanay felt
that he needed no aids to wakefulness just
then he had never been less inclined to
sleep and when he had ordered the pre-
scribed small bottle from one of his
sleepy kroo-boy stewards he said to char-
teris broadly-

  ye have your own way o finding out
things i dont doubt but what im most
concerned with is the real object o your
honorable presence on my veranda at this
hour o th night

  charteris had dropped into the chair
where he had flung his hat there was no
visible artificiality in his manner but it was
none the less disconcerting

  im here partly because i want to be
and greatly to talk things over he re-
turned placidly frankly i detest mystery
and espionage and all their attendant evils
and dangers and inconveniences and your
confounded spies or trade-scouts or what-
ever they are called are scattered all over
the shop a man cant stir without tripping
over one or two of them

  macgregor laughed in throaty derision
yere a convincing talker he admitted
but if yeve come up here to make faces
at me-well heres the fizzy drink well
do it the honor of our whole attention if ye
dont mind

  apparently charteris had no objection
when the champagne glasses had been
filled he lifted his and without any exag-
gerated flourishes proposed a simple toast
to margarets health and happiness

  and when he dropped and smashed the
glass thereby honoring margaret as upon
occasion the king is honored hog-
manay who solemnly followed suit had an
odd impression that the queer devil was
as old and respectable as his hair after all

  macgregor kicked the bits of broken
glass from under his feet and called the
steward to sweep them up

  there was no handshaking no platitudes
charteris produced his gun-metal cigaret
case and macgregor his pipe and for a
minute or two after the steward had gone it

seemed as if neither wished to resume the
subject of their differences

  as i was sayin hogmanay spoke
heavily at last if yeve come up here to
make faces at me yeve made a mistake in
your man yere interfering with the firms
business-with marsden  co-and ive
got to put an end to that in other words
you and i have got to understand each
other

  exactly charteris agreed and sat up
a little thats the reason im just a little
curious why you havent tried to nail
abado

  hogmanays eyebrows lifted and fell and
he hesitated studying the other man and his
somewhat amazing frankness with cold
suspicion then taking a leaf out of
charteris book he asked bluntly-

  how do ye know i havent

  because the members of your really
admirable intelligence department have
made no effort to give him away in spite of
the fact that i am quite sure they know
where he is

  yere too complimentary hogmanay
said dryly then added after a short pause
but i havent been much interested in
abado-lately

  no why not

  thats my business but ill tell ye this

much yere a queer stick and ill be-

if i think yere any friend o mine but im
not ready just yet to think o you as an
accessory to hugh morrisons murder
and thats that

  thanks i appreciate-

  och i dont give tuppence for your
appreciation and im much more inter-
ested in abados trade than i am in him or
you or all this mysteriousness thats going
on but since ye seem to like impertinent
questions ill ask ye one

  yes what is it

  hogmanay leaned forward and said in
a low cautious voice-

  doridi

  charteris eyes betrayed nothing at all
not even the fact that he knew macgregor
was only bluffing

  what about him

  thats what im askin you what have
ye done wi him

  charteris laughed

  he is the fellow who was so free with
his information to miss jardines maid
wasnt he


adventure

  aye what are ye hidin him for
hphm this is interesting particu-
larly since your information is somewhat
twisted as a matter of fact that oung
mans disappearance has been rather puz-
zling

  hogmanay said nothing for several min-
utes just sat perfectly still and looked
charteris through and through as if he were
determined to make the test a final one

  charteris scarcely moved his indiffer-
ence to the exacting scrutiny in spite of the
incessant hum of the mosquitoes about his
ears was in every respect a finished per-
formance

 hugh morrison wasnt just my em-
ployer macgregor said at last in heavy
emphasis he was also a frien o mine
and a good one and if i ever catch the
man that killed him ill be sore tempted to
hang him with my own hands ye under-
stand

  perfectly

  mind ye hogmanay continued point-
edly this is no a threat but im not
sayin it couldnt be interpreted as a hint
to outsiders to mind their own business
charteris smiled

  i really dont know where doridi is
he said so convincingly that hogmanay
almost believed him

  hunh and i suppose yere just as ig-
norant o whats happenin to abados oil
and all that uncanny lookin igabo and bush
sobo trade yere enticin down here
charteris glance strayed to the light at
the head of the bonny s companion ladder
and he ignored the question completely
hogmanay snorted

  did it ever occur to ye that yeve got

a-of a lot o cheek whatll ye do if i

tell malkett or parker on ye

nothing i came up here perfectly
willing to go to jail if you insisted upon it
ye did eh then yell bear watchin
hogmanay paused then added cannily
but ye havent answered my question
yet whats your object in interferin with
marsden  cos business

 am i

och dont annoy me with your
footerin evasions hogmanay exploded
do ye think im daft or in my dotage
charteris threw his cigaret over the
veranda rail

  you know of course that agwala has
been selling to the siluko and koratown

independents at very high prices he asked
and his manner had suddenly and startlingly
become frankly cooperative

  aye suspiciously i know that
and that hes been taking vouchers that
are virtually four to six months notes in
payment

  just that hes gettin to be an expert
on the subject o credit hes had diamond
fits and cushion fits and fits o canary
island furniture now its credit and
what of it

simply that notes or currency are no
good in the native markets cloth gin rice
salt silks and so forth are the things the oil
and kernel gatherers want for their produce
aye go on

  abado and the rest are selling to the
independents at somewhat lower prices and
getting the stuff to barter with charteris
concluded with amazing ingenuousness
all of it

  hunh macgregor grunted but
whats to hinder agwala cornin to me or
goin to any of our other branches in warri
or sapeli and gettin all the barter goods he
wants

  nothing in the world hes doing about
half of his business with you now just to
keep him supplied in these bartering com-
modities so that he can buy oil and kernels
at the native markets to sell in turn to youjr
competitors the independents at higher
prices on a credit basis

  im also aware o that macgregor
growled

  and i thought it might be quite a trick
to make agwala pay for- the privilege of
using marsden  co as a convenience-as
a kind of warehouse

  eh whats that hogmanay sat up
straight

  because when siluko and koratown
re-sell at home all the oil and kernels ag-
wala has been selling to them on credit
charteris continued simply and implacably

they will have money to do things with

and these things will be done principally to
marsden  co

  your discourse is vera interestin

  and when the independents begin to pay
their debts in goods to agwala about six
months hence he will be in a position to gain
control of several more native markets than
he does now and consequently to charge
you still more for the privilege of being his
warehouseman
the gray charteris



  macgregor resented the designation but
he had no difficulty in absorbing the fact
his bushy eyebrows lowered and he nodded
tilowly

  aye i get your drift hes puttin our
competitors on their legs again at our ex-
pense as it were and gettin ready to raise
prices on both of us at the same time
aye sourly just that

  it was in truth a more subtle amplifica-
tion of what agwala had threatened he
would do if abado were tiot boycotted
hogmanay did not admit this to charteris
however instead he now regarded him
with open suspicion

  im afraid i dont appreciate ye at your
full value he commented dryly whats
your object-your ultimate object-in bein
so instructive

  you said it was time we understood each
other and i thought my view of the trading
situation might be interesting

  hogmanay nodded slowly

  och ill admit its interestin he said
without enthusiasm so is the book o
revelations but its needed an awful lot
o explainin

  charteris smiled

  i thought youd be trader enough to
take the hint

  i am

  then we understand each other per-
fectly charteris concluded and rose as if
he were satisfied to have the interview end
there

maybe ye think we do said hogmanay
heavily but im no so sure whats on
your mind out with it man out with it
with a laugh charteris swung suddenly
toward the stairs

  my heads as empty as agwalas prom-
ises he said significantly but i do hope
youll tell miss jardine that i lost no time
in wishing her luck good night

  and hogmanay found that he was alone
with an interrogation point for company

when charteris reached marsden 
cos concrete breakwater a small
female voice came cautiously out of
the murk to meet him

  you look him

  i look him we talk big palaver long
time

  noni knew how long it was

  he go marry missy capn she asked
as eagerly as any match-making dowager

  

as she perched herself on the tail of char-
teriss canoe

  but he did not choose to discuss mar-
garets marry palaver with her even
though he had found the girls questionably
gained and gratuitously offered information
on the matter both timely and helpful

  presently however he took the oppor-
tunity to ask

  noni when you make bark look all
same fool you no sorry lil bit

  the girls dark eyes expanded furiously

  them day i kill him i glad too much
she prophesied with savage emphasis

   think you he charteris accused
calmly without turning his head

  chat i no lie i go kill him i go cut
him head ten--twenty time

  nevertheless charteris did not believe
her but when he had seen her safely
aboard the hulk and was making his leisure-
ly way up river again he thought she would
be able to hate arthur effectively enough
until it was no longer necessary

chapter xvi

the woman of it

n sunday forenoon when daniel
dane parker stepped on board the
bonny among the last things he appeared to
be thinking about was the possibility that
the fugitive abado might be found at
grandisons beach

  he had had a short conversation with
malkett mumbled a few words to bark
who seemed nervous and preoccupied then
made himself perfectly comfortable in a
deck chair and indulged himself in the lux-
ury of being entertained by elsie and
fran

  catherine who did not like his mood sat
on the sidelines and surveyed him with a
minuteness that would have made him feel
most uncomfortable had he known any-
thing about it

  she came to the several conclusions that
she liked his laugh his forehead the brown
breadth of his hands the driving force that
was behind his shoulders and the obvious
resistance that was in the strong column of
his neck but his eyes bothered her possi-
bly because they said nothing she had ex-
pected them to say

  after luncheon he went off alone in his
own launch visited marsdens beach and


adventure

conversed with hogmanay for upward of
an hour

  macgregor said nothing about char-
teris visit of the previous evening and
certainly did not explain a small piece of
broken glass the great dane happened to
crunch under his heavy soled tramping
boots

  they talked trade and good liquor and
exchanged a story or two in the most casual
fashion and then parker asked as if he had
just happened to think of it-

  that fellow doridi hasnt been on your
beach lately has he

  no slowly are ye lookin for him
wed like to check up the girls story
parker said indifferently then leaned for-
ward rather sharply theres rather more
than usual in this case mac that doesnt
meet the eye

  charteris for instance

  parker nodded

  of course we could bring a company
of the waffs around here to keep you
thieves and murderers in order and tear up
grandisons old place in fine style but i hate
like the -- to use good ammunition to
shoot agwalas chestnuts out of the fire
hogmanys eyebrows lifted in mock sur-
prize

how do ye know theyre there to shoot
parker examined his bootlaces minutely
and with all these women in the river
a rumpus of that sort would be indelicate
whv dont you send them home

 me

  of course theyre your womenfolk

and they are so-inquisitive

  hogmanay grinned

  are they all thats stoppin you from
shootin

  the great dane rose abruptly

  lets go up and have a talk with char-
teris

 fine 

  catherine saw the launch leave marsdens
wharf and followed it with her eyes every
inch of the way to grandisons beach
fran theyre going up there oh

i wish-

  the wish trailed off into nothingness and
fran kept to her deck-chair and the shade
and ignored it in any case

  occasionally she put her hands across her
eyes and squeezed them and every little
while she went down to her cabin and sur-
reptitiously bathed them and looked at her-

self steadily in the mirror to be sure it was
just the sun

  no one appeared to observe how shrink-
ingly afraid fran had become of the blind-
ing glare of it

  catherine saw parkers launch arrive at
grandisons beach and stood leaning upon
the bonnys rail waiting for it to return

  parker found nothing but ogulo the
dwarf who was discovered cowering in the
old kernel store the stunted black was
shivering with fear and played the part that
had been assigned to him more naturally
than he cared to

  wheres charteris parker demanded
he done go sah maybe so he come
back i no savez

  where he go

  i no savez sah i be small boy he no
tell me which place he go or which time he
come i fear gray man sah he be ju-ju
and i be poor jakri man--

youre a glorious liar parker conceded
calmly which place i look you before
hes one of oagadis boys-ogulo
hogmanay broke in from akwanna
you remember oagadi dont ye

  of course died about five or six years
ago didnt he as cool and devilish an old
reprobate as ever escaped the rope whats
his nibs doing here

  oh i expect charteris brought ogulo
with him they make a grand pair dont
they

  parker studied the dwarf intimately
you be oagadi son he asked sharply
ogulo nodded and his knees sagged his
fear of the white mans laws was an awful
thing

  whats matter you live in this place
i run way my fadder angry ogulo
answered truthfully enough

your father dead long time parker ex-
claimed whats matter you say he angry
i talk true sah before my father done
die i take nother man wife be my father
frien he angry too much

  as a matter of fact ogulo had done
nothing of the sort he had run away to
escape the penalty for his failure to execute
his fathers orders in the matter of the
desired death of a certain young jakri
named benniba-atba

  in the affray with benniba ogulos father
had lost several sons and had himself re-
ceived a mortal injury all because ogulo-
of-the-long-arms had been unable to arrive
the gray charteris



upon the scene on time therefore the
dwarf had never gone back to akwanna not
even when his father had died

  of his own accord he had become an
outcast and having skulked through the
bush for many years vainly seeking refuge
and honor among many peoples from the

	benin country to the land of the kwa he
had like any ishmael returned to the home
of his fathers or as near to it as he dared

  grandisons beach had offered him a
haven and before charteris had arrived
there ogulo had taken pleasure in being
the ghost that was believed by many of the
natives to have made the place its own

   at the back of the beach at the entrance
to the path that led to the village of dow-
adda ogulo had found at fairly regular
intervals offerings of yams and plantains
and palm wine and even a fowl or two
since he was a ghost of ravenous appetite
it was hoped his hunger would be appeased
in this way and he would leave the village
in peace

   charteris had changed all that as he had
changed the wholeface of the river and the
thoughts that ran wild in the minds of men

  i think your woman talk is lie talk
parker said after a moments reflection
which place the woman live

   she live-she live in her mother house
wheres that at the bottom of sa-
ganna water in the belly of a crocodile
the whites of the dwarfs eyes rolled so
that they looked like the eyes of a catfish
the sacred crocodile pool of sacrifice at
saganna was in truth the gfeat mother
of many women who had been induced by
the doctors and priests of the jakri country
to cure their barrenness by swimming
across it some of them had actually
reached the other side but the wife of
ogulo the dwarf had not been one of them
white men however were not supposed to
know of these things

  be jakri man say she go have plenty
son he hastened to say in his own defense
no be me tell her me i be poor jakri
man i no savez nothing

  parker threw his head back and laughed
then nudged hogmanay with his elbow

  come on mac no use taking him
along as extra baggage and i suppose
charteris will be down at the yacht this
evening to apologize for not being at home
when we called

  on the tumbledown gig-wharf parker

halted and looked back grandisons beach
was the last word in desolation and there
was not a sign of life in the bush that bound-
ed it upon three sides

  if yere as sure about it as all that hog-
manay suggested suggestively why dont ye
nab charteris himsel when he comes back

  parkers grin was the kind catherine liked

  because i shouldnt know what on earth
to do with him if i did

  and ye have a notion hes maybe a help
instead o a hindrance macgregor hinted
shrewdly

  parker made no response to macgregors
innuendo he was just a little afraid that
his reply would havfe to be in the affirmative
if he told the truth and if such proved
actually to be the case the result contrarily
enough would be rifles and machine-guns

ij after dinner that evening mar-
garet jardine who had not found
a bit of chicken on any of the nu-
merous plates that had been placed before
her sat with fran and hogmanay in the
open glare of the bonnys deck lights and
tried to look perfectly at ease her color
came and went something like an intermit-
tent headlight but her manner was very
much less guilty than hogmanays

  he did not sit easily in his chair and he
was experiencing much the same sensations
of his earlier days when the sermon was
long and dry and the paper bag of sweet-
ies in his pocket crackled enormously
when he tried to secure one of the mix-
tures and sneak it solemnly and surrep-
titiously into his mouth

  margaret and he had of course made no
public announcement of their mutual un-
derstanding of the future and fran who sat
with her back to the light pretended to look
as if such an announcement were necessary

  farther up the deck malkett smoked one
of captain waltons cigars and talked to
him about salmon fishing and trout flies

  elsie and tommy dillingworth because
the library was officially engaged suffered
the swelter of the saloon below rather than
be disturbed by the mosquitoes and sand
flies this was tommys idea and elsie
being in a soft and lonely humor-a humor
that expressed a clinging fearfulness-
tommy came to the just conclusion ere
the evening was done that life was really
a wonderful thing if you knew how to
arrange it properly 


adventure

iheriffs clint hawkins
and tom salyers standing on
opposite banks of red river and
i in their respective counties
glowered across the boundary at each other
with an animosity developed by years of

official rivalry and brought to a climax by
the present tensely delicate situation

  the river was barely a hundred feet wide
at this point midway of it between the
two kentucky sheriffs floated a log
raft and squatting calmly thereon was a

  in the shadow of a deck house noni who
had accompanied her mistress as usual
regarded macgregor and his methods with
scorn arthur garriman bark discovered
her there and enticed her into the deeper
shadows that ruled aft

  arthur was very quiet about it he had
to be and he did not upbraid noni for her
deceit in the matter of the marry palaver
on the contrary he assured her that he had
come to the conclusion that it would be a
most excellent arrangement if her father
were not abado

  the identity of her male parent made the
situation rather difficult there was no
one to whom he could pay the marriage
price-no one save abado-and obviously
he could not pay it to him

  noni drew her cloth tighter about her
sinuous little body and compelled bark to
follow her hither and thither among the
shadows one step at a time occasionally

she stood quite near to him so near that
arthur almost believed what he said and
near enough for noni to discover the exact
location of his heart noni thought that
when the time came it would be very simple

  if his polished leather leggings in which
she could see her face when the sun was up
and his white mans boots and his white
mans uniform with the glistening buttons
down the front of it-if all these things
were not it would be still more simple

  so she suddenly flung away from him
angrily and used lamentable words to ex-
press her opinion of his utter worthlessness
as a jakri and his meager pretense of being
white

  but a minute later a round brown arm
was again sliding softly about his neck and
she was gently rubbing her cheek against
the silver buttons on his tunic

  if only her sons when they were men
could wear a uniform like that-

                           to be continued

                                                                           --------j -

troubled waters



stoop-shouldered unshaven man a fishing-
pole in his hand and a rifle leaning against
his knee stacked behind him was a quantity
of driftwood near by a gaudy handmade
quilt a skillet a bundle of food and a few
flat rocks the raft was secured by a chain
to a pile driven into a sand-bar which cleft
the flood several yards above but beneath
and around it swirled treacherous waters
whose depth - no living human had ever
plumbed

  early morning mists crawled along the
twisting current sending up a streamer here
and there to connect with the heavier dew
clouds that blanketed the flanking moun-
tain walls cutting their forested sides into
strata and dimming the sun which was
slowly burning its way up over the eastern
summits it was an isolated spot with the
nearest cabin a mile away and the moun-
tains sloping steeply to the river allowed
only a narrow trail along either bank

  clint hawkins drew tighter his cartridge
belt from which hung a holstered brace of
 specials andspat into an eddy at his feet

  tom salyers he called self-control
smothering the fires of his anger i still
hold that sim there is in menefee county
and my lawful prisoner im a-going to
arrest him like i sot out to and i dont
want you to interfere

  naw you aint sheriff salyers voice
also was studiously controlled but a 
winchester in the crook of his right arm
lifted a trifle as he spoke the survey
books ive read dont say that red rivers
in your county they tell in plain print
that it jest bounds menefee on the south
now a markin that bounds a passel of
land he argued cant nowise in reason be
a part of that land that means the river
dont belong to you all dont it

  then it aint in wolfe county neither
clint hawkins retorted ive read them
survey books too and they low pintedly
that this fork bounds wolfe on the north
reasoning the same way you do he con-
cluded its not in one county or the other
but just lays between em its kain-
tuckys river here i reckon by that no-
body elses so whos got the right to
arrest a feller thats hiding out on it

  the question nonplused tom salyers for
a moment then he replied superiorly

 why anybody of course the law
says that a murderer can be took prisoner
by even a common citizen without a war-

rant no matter where hes found in the
hull state hes liable to arrest by whosoever
happens on him and can lock him up i
give the high sheriff of menefee credit for
knowing that much law anyway he added
with a slight sneer

  the man on the raft paused in his fishing
and grinned through his stubble of beard
first at one officer then the other

   wal why dont ye come on out and git
me he drawled this here turn-hole
im sittin over has mighty takin ways
bill ginter was the last who tried to ford
hit ye recollect-and he and his mule liked
the bottom so well they never riz up even
oncet to tell whar hit was but maybe yo
all and yer hosses will fare a leetle better
if ye splice a fishin-cork to yer saddles

  he chuckled mockingly and again threw
his line into the current

  both sheriffs saw a much safer way than
that he suggested to reach him it was
simply to wade out to the sand-bar with a
few strong-armed assistants lay hold of the
anchoring chain and draw the raft in
but each hesitated for te same reason-the
other

  they were matched in height equally
thewed booted and slouch-hatted and
wore store-clothes that similar adventures
of the past eighteen hours had studded with
burs and splotched with mud clint hawk-
ins however was stoutly built with a
sandy mustache trailing between his aqui-
line nose and fighters jaw while tom sal-
yers was grizzled and lean his smooth-
shaven features sharply chiseled

  they were proud fearless men born of
the same rugged mountain stock used to
taking orders from none and ruling their
respective counties like benevolent despots
because of this similarity of temperament
and because their bailiwicks adjoined they
frequently came into conflict each was
jealous of his official reputation each had
friends and enemies who were not held as
such in the others esteem and in seeking
to protect or punish them accordingly each
officer sometimes had to reckon with his
brother sheriffs power and resourcefulness

  many a law-breaker taking advantage of
this well-known rivalry sought tom sal-
yers favor by telling him of slanders ut-
tered by clint hawkins and in turn lies
reached clint hawkins to the effect that
tom salyers had said certain uncompli-
mentary things about him behind his back


adventure

thus was the fire of animosity fed harm-
less enough while the two men kept apart
but full of dangerous possibilities when as
chanced now they were brought face to
face

sim conley with cunning fore-
sight gambled on this when he took
refuge on the raft midway of the dis-
puted boundary nor had he much choice
in the matter there came to his liquor-
drugged ears word that the sheriffs and
their posses were closing in on him from all
sides there was no gap in their lines through
which he coum escape and the odds were
too great to tempt a stand-off fight so
racing with the minutes he had looted the
nearest cabin of supplies taken possession
of the raft used by that neighborhood in
flood-times as a ferry and fortified himself
against immediate capture by anchoring
over the whirlpool	

  having settled one point of law to their
own satisfaction at least another arose
between the two officers who ignored sims
sarcasm clint hawkins hands on hips
his feet wide apart again opened the
argument

  you know mighty well mr sheriff
he recommenced that sim conleys got
to be took to our jail-house one time or
another the killin was done in this county
and its a case for the menefee courts

  tom salyers stubbornly shook his gray
head

  noble martin was killed on this side
he maintained his own woman and
children are witnesses to that they seen
it all happen up there right in front of their
house

  yes but sim was standing across the
river when he fired the shot and since
the bullet come from over here this was
where noble got his death-else hed still be
living that makes it our murder dont
it

  not by a long sight sim could a
stood in menefee and shot this way from
now to new christmas but if he hadnt
hit nobody he wouldnt be guilty of
crime as it was he hit a man in wolfe
county that man died here-so its jest
plain reason that our courts have got to
avenge him im a-going to see that they
do it too

  clint hawkins threw a hand to his right
holster his fighters jaw squared

  tom salyers he threatened solemnly
if you try to take that feller ill send you

to-with him

  the wolfe county sheriffs eyes glittered
and his finger closed over the trigger of his
winchester

  let me warn you too clint hawkins
he menaced make a move toward him
and ill plug you before you touch the
water hes my prisoner and i aim to per-
tect him accordin to my rights under the
law

  they glared across the swirling river at
each other like two catamounts awaiting
the signal of instinct to spring neither
was bluffing and both knew it usually
mild-tempered and over-lenient when han-
dling a matter of police they were on their
mettle now conscious of their personal and
official powers yet they were not fools
they had that quality of courage which
recognizes fruitless self-sacrifice as akin to
cowardice and which respects a worthy
opponent

  i wisht yo boys ud stop makin so much
fuss broke in sim rebaiting his hook
ye didnt give me time to dig worms er
seine no minners and hits hard enough
gittin these fish to swaller bacon fat without
yo all skeerin em ye plumb disgust me
a-spilin my sport on sech a fine mornin
t aint ofen that the water and airs both
in my favor like this 

  tom salyers turned the batteries of his
wrath upon him

  you fiesty rascal he exploded why
dont you come to one bank or the other
you aint gaining nothing but a little time
by camping out there

  sim cocked a speculative eye whatll
ye promise me if i paddle over to yourn
he asked

  ill promise you a quick trial and a
quicker trip down below to the lectric
chair the sheriff replied promptly

  umm ill have to study on that afore
i call it a trade he squinted toward the
opposite shore clint what have ye got
to offer if i let yo take me prisoner

  the burly peace officer swore

  ill give you three minutes to say your
prayers and a chance to escape then ill
hand you out a death sentence on the run
from these here holsters

  gosh sim shrugging picked up his
cane pole yo fellers sartainly have
agreed fer oncet in yer lives i shouldnt
troubled waters



doubt but id best stay right whar i am
ontil ive got my fill o fishin

  what do you figger on doin then
demanded clint hawkins alert

  wal- sim gestured down-stream-
maybe ill jest cut loose and go on ontil
i git from atween wolfe and menefee and
float into powell county there aint
no dispute over who owns red river thar
-and i got a heap o friends in them parts
the sheriff o powell is my paws fust
cousin he added significantly rick
conley has a master way o takin keer o
his folks too

  hawkins and salyers exchanged frankly
worried glances they knew that what
sim hinted at doing was not impossible and
that once in his native county among
friends and under the protection of his
sheriff cousin nothing short of an invasion
by the state militia could effect his capture

  by this time however the trio were not
alone the crime of the morning before
had stirred the attention of both counties
and by an intelligence system peculiar to
the kentucky mountains every one in that
section had been kept informed of the prog-
ress of the man-hunt they knew that
each sheriff had taken the trail in person at
the head of a hastily conscripted posse
that sim conley beguiled by his prime
weakness had sought refreshment at the
still nearest the murder scene and that the
officers throwing their deputies into skirmish
formation and combing every cabin ravine
and thicket were surrounding him there

  sparsely settled as the region was a small
audience already had begun to gather on
either side of the river the curious ones
were careful not to get too close to the
place of threatened hostilities but here
and there a face peered from behind a tree
trunk while a few bolder mountaineers
crouched in the open apparently unarmed
and unconcerned from what the first-
comers had heard and what they all now
saw the situation was as clear to them as
to the three men directly involved

  loping up the menefee trail astride a
bare-backed mule came andy spurlock
his swarthy features grim with anxiety and
his rifle ready for action he was a member
of sheriff hawkins posse and he slid from
his mount even before he reached his chief

  clint he gasped in a whisper if we
dont git him now this here river will be as
red as hits name

  and he told a tale which for a minute
made the sheriff forget his contender on the
opposite bank

  that makes it a - sweet mess all

right he exclaimed when andy had fin-
ished with one of my regular deputies at
home sick and the other clean out of reach
way over on licking im pintedly up
against it

  he pulled at his mustache frowning
then decisively he commanded in a low
tone

  andy you strike back to town as hard
as you can go pick up every man you can
count on along the way and take em before
jedge combs tell him i said to swear em
in as deputies and give em all the catridges
for their guns that they can tote send
word to any more youre shore of too and
have the jedge do the same by them then
you fetch em to the mouth of wolf pen
creek down there and let me know right off
how many you got and how the land lays
remember you aint to waste a single
minute this here business calls for quick
work and a heap of it

  young spurlock with a brief nod re-
mounted and kicked his mule into a gallop

  across the water came a jeering laugh

   i can read your mind bettern you think
clint hawkins sending off for help are
you aint sheriff enough to take your
prisoner single-handed wal im jest
telling you we grow real he-men over here
in wolfe county any one of em can
whop a round dozen of your menefee
tackies

  a chorus of loud snickers from sheltering
trees and bushes on the other side ap-
plauded tom salyers taunt

  sheriff hawkins flushed angrily but he
was not in the humor for empty banter

  mr salyers he called knowing
something that you dont i counsel you
to kick a few of your he-men out of hiding
and tie guns in their fists ive jest heard
that the conleys and their friends down
in powell are getting together to come up
here and take sim they low that feelings
too strong against him in wolfe and mene-
fee for him to get justice and theyve
swore to capture him themselves and set
him free

  as for me he concluded stiffly im
a-going to stick right here and see this little
game through i dont need a single deputy
to help me neither


adventure

  tom salyers instantly became grave
he knew that sheriff hawkins was speaking
the truth and what that truth meant

  the man on the raft who was most con-
cerned by the news said nothing but jerk-
ing up his pole landed a cat-fish on the logs
beside him

  the wolfe county sheriff beckoned to a
deputy who had arrived on the scene some
minutes before but remained at a distance
and held a whispered consultation di-
rectly the deputy strode away taking one
of the on-lookers with him and both dis-
appeared up the laureled mountainside

  ill be ready for them powell county
jayhawkers salyers said aloud his gaunt
figure more erect before they get hold of
my prisoner theyll have to whop some of
the fightinest men in all kaintucky
yes declared hawkins seating himself
for the first time on a stump near by if
they try coming up on this side of the river
theyll take more men home dead than they
started with a-livin my boysll show em
whos running this county

  both sheriffs boasted with a confidence
that they did not feel a whole clan of
desperate mountaineers armed with modern
weapons and moonshine whisky was a force
to be reckoned with even when met with
like numbers and due preparation under
the circumstances however each officer
had to rely upon his lieutenant to recruit the
warriors who would defend his county
against invasion equip them as best he
could and lead them to meet the attack

  more critical still was the fact that the
conleys already were gathering and might
at any time cross the boundary if that
happened before late afternoon the earliest
hour that any considerable body of men
could be assembled to oppose them the
fight would be short and one-sided indeed

with this new danger threatening
a strained silence enveloped the
vicinity of the whirlpool those
who came to witness a bout of wits or per-
chance a fatal show-down between the two
sheriffs now realized that even they might
be drawn into an inter-county war some
of the onlookers slipped hurriedly away
others took guns from the concealment of
their persons and glanced about for a con-
venient large rock or rhododendron clump

  another wolfe county deputy who had
been detailed to the bereaved home of

noble martin three miles up the river
came to report to tom salyers

  hows nobles brother frank taking
it the sheriff inquired anxiously

  the deputy shook his head

  he aint sayin much he replied jest
standin round by hisself and a-studyin
i sidled up to him oncet and axed if he
knowed yo and clint was dowp here
wranglin over which countyll git to send
sim to the lectric cheer but frank he
didnt pear consarned lowed he aims to
bury his dead afore he looks to the livin-
and went off a-studyin agin

  his woman axed me though to be shore
and fotch home that bed-kiver and skillet
sim stole from their house early this
mornin i calls hit powful nervy o him to
kill a man and then go rob his brother
whilst hes away waitin on the corpse
it was nervy agreed tom salyers-
but that aint the worst of my troubles
this here business is gettin more dangerous
every minute you go back and keep an
eye on frank martin pacify him and his
folks all you can and dont tell em the
conleys are a-gathering

  noon came sim who had not spoken
a word for a full two hours laid aside his
pole and with some of the drift-wood made
a fire on the flat rocks he had forethought-
fully taken aboard soon the luscious
odors of frying fish and baking corn pone
floated from the raft to either bank

 clint hawkins who had had only a
snatched-up breakfast at dawn sniffed
and licked his lips tom salyers equally
as hungry and unprovisioned searched his
pockets for  a chew of tobacco sim
squatting over his fire watched them fur-
tively

  i sartainly wish i could ax yo fellers
out to dinner he drawled after a while
but i take hit that ye wouldnt come if i

did	howsomever- he stuck his jack-
knife into a large fish in the skillet-i cant
sot by and see ye all starve that aint
the way i was brung up

  here tom with a dexterous swing of
his arm he flung the fish toward the wolfe
county bank that uns youm i got to
ax yer pardon fer offerin ye mud-cats
but hit pears thems the only sort that
frequent this turn-hole clint i aint fer-
gittin yo ketch this un and try yer
tooth in him

  sheriff hawkins fumbling the hot fish
troubled waters



was about to do as invited when the growl-
ing voice of a fellow menefee county man
sounded on the mountainside behind him

  aw why dont yo two show some sense
even if sim is guilty o murder in both
counties and aint hidin out in neither
thars a easy way to git him clint yo
and tom draw yer guns level on him to-
gither and when i speak the word pull yer
triggers thatll settle the argument 
clint hawkins threw the untasted fish to
a hound that was skulking near by an
inborn sense of honor forbade his eating the
food of a man whose life he sought

  what do you say to that idee salyers
he demanded springing up

  sheriff salyers deliberately dropped his
fish into the river

  it wont do he snapped to kill a
feller who aint resistin arrest would be
plain murder i wont take a hand in such
doins myself and ill bear witness in open
court against any man who does

  but what if sim acts on his notion to
cut loose and drift on down out of our
reach persisted clint hawkins are we
going to suffer him to do that

  tom salyers also saw the need of some
sort of compromise

  wal he said thoughtfully ill meet
you haf way there if he tries to go down
the middle of the river hell be a fugitive
from justice men you will see him start
at the same time i reckon and well both
open fire hows that

  sheriff hawkins nodded

  that suits me exactly he said and re-
seated himself on the stump he belongs
to us both the second he cuts loose

  sim conley abruptly quit eating he
stared a moment at sheriff salyers then at
clint hawkins tried to speak mumbled to
himself instead and groped for his rifle

  for half an hour he sat hunched o-ver on
the raft the gun across his lap brooding
into the water all sarcastic levity was
gone from his unshaven features and a
strange solemnity masked them in spite
of the midday heat frequent shivers
wracked his bent figure and his teeth
chattered

 whars the nighest preacher he finally
broke out addressing no one in particular
sheriff hawkins wondering answered-
parson pence over on salt fork i
reckon

 would ye kindly send somebody to

fetch him sim asked and his earnestness
was akin to humility i want to confess
my sins and be baptised afore hits too
late

  ill go atter him volunteered a wolfe
county onlooker hes up at noble
martins a-comfortin his widder

  a while later sim appealed to sheriff

salyers

  tom he said will yo all grant me a
truce and sware not to tech me if i pull into
the sand-bar and meet the preacher

  salyers hesitated what do you say
hawkins he inquired across the water
even a man-killer deservin of death
himself has a right to get religion aint
he

  i give my word not to hinder him the
menefee sheriff promised hell be safe
ontii hes done coming through

       it was an unusual ceremony even
in that country where unusual hap-
vjs penings are the rule old parson
pence a tattered song-book in hand stood
with sim knee-deep in the riffle and began
his favorite hymn how firm a founda-
tion the men on either bank gathering
at the waters edge and baring their heads
took up the words from memory and sang
them through to the last verse thunderous
bass harmonizing with plaintive minor

  denizens of a lonely land where folk
worshiped as hard as they fought there was
no hypocrisy in their reverence they
heard sims voluble confession with stony
faces bowed while the parson wrastled in
prayer over his many sins chanted an-
other hymn as the penitent went under the
water-and unsheathed their guns and re-
sumed their former posts when he again
boarded the raft and the old man disap-
peared down the river toward home

  with the lowering sun came sinister and
similar reports to the sheriffs their lieu-
tenants had not found it easy to get re-
cruits whose primary object was to protect
a lone criminal whom both counties claimed
as prisoner each mountaineer was in-
tensely individual from environment and
tradition he did his own thinking and acted
according to his own judgment and his
pioneer training had taught him that a
mans first duty in such a crisis is to remain
at home and defend his own family all
knew very well that the conleys would not
stop simply at rescuing their kinsman but


adventure

aroused by that outlawish errand would
pillage and burn and kill along the way

  i got only a sparse dozen men re-
ported sheriff salyers deputy returning
and theys most as bad as the conleys
the others i axed says fer yo to go on and
let clint have sim he aint worth gittin
kilt over they low that yere causin
more trouble then yere stoppin by actin
mulish like this

  salyers scowled

  whos sheriff of this here county any-
way he demanded hotly aint i jest
trying to hold up the law as its writ and
bring a criminal to justice of course i
am-and im not going to give a inch of
ground even if my feller citizens have gone
back on me i aim to stay right here until
this things settled my way

  you take what men youve got he
ordered and scatter em along the powell
county line if them conleys start up this
side fight em off as long as theres a one of
you left alive hear me

  andy spurlock was holding a like council
of war with his chief

  i tell ye clint this ructions got mighty
unpopular in menefee he declared ill
do jest as yo say with the few boys i got-
but i aint promisin nothin except from
myself hits plain now that them con-
leys air waitin till dark afore they begin
their deviltry theys a mile over on their
side o the line in a holler back o bald
knob lickerin up and practisin at targets
ye know what that means

  sim conley had not resumed his fishing
he sat with his knees bent up under his
chin his slouch hat pulled low apparently
dozing but beneath that hat a pair of
cunning eyes were mapping the flanking
mountainsides locating every ravine and
thicket and bowlder heedful too of the
deepening shadows that soon would make
concealment certain once those wooded
heights were attained the whirlpool made
swimming down-stream impossible and up
the river beyond a giant sycamore which
in falling had bridged the current was the
hostile region of the martin homes be-
sides the water in that direction was too
shallow for a prolonged dive and sim by
nature much preferred to take his chances
on land

  tom salyers was restlessly pacing the
wolfe county bank the winchester still in
the crook of his arm now and then he

paused to listen but all he heard was his
own weary breathing the gurgle of the
water and the mournful whistle of a whip-
poorwill his little audience of onlookers
losing interest in the deadlock had drifted
away one by one

  directly he halted and faced the opposite
shore

  clint hawkins he began men you
cant stay here like this all night you
aint had nothing to eat since daybreak and
i low youre purty well wore out swailer
your stubbornness this once and then
well both go home

  i reckon i aint more wore out than
you are returned sheriff hawkins grin-
ning feebly you was up beating the
brush all last night too and ive seen your
acting today tom salyers im a-going to
allow that youve got more nerve than i
ever give you credit for youve toted fair
with me in this mess and you aint the
sneak that several folks have told me you
was

   your county neednt be ashamed of you
neither salyers tone was almost cordial
but- veering back to the original sub-
ject-i do think you ought to let me have
sim i thought a heap of noble martin
and i want to lay holt of the man who
killed him

  noble was a mighty good friend of
mine too i feel like i owe it to him to see
hes rightly avenged its a personal
private matter with me there

  wal whichever jail-house gets this
prisoner will have to be held against his
folks who are a-coming theyll attack it
shore to set him free arresting him now
will jest be the start of worse trouble for
one of us

  cint hawkins pondered this fact thought-
fully the vision of his county seat turned
into a battlefield by a drunken mob bent on
destroying all who opposed them and per-
haps put to the torch was not pleasant
even to a man of his militant instincts

  sim conley sensed immediate danger to
himself hunger weariness and the de-
velopments of the afternoon were plainly
working like a leaven in the brains of both
sheriffs any minute now a compromise
might be effected between them-and the
conley clan was still miles away

  im a saved manand i aint afeerd to

die sim muttered confidently to himself
but even parson pence didnt low that
troubled waters



one whos come through hasnt a right to
fight fer his life gittin religion cant
nowise mean that ive got to let myself be
hung ill sware to be a sober law-abidin
citizen if i kin jest git out o this ill
throw away my rifle-gun and tend meetin
regular yas i will

  the mountainsides were blackening
wisps of mist veiled the coves and hollows
and an obscuring purple haze was creeping
up the river valley the sun long lost
behind the western summits turned into
crimson a lone white cloud just above the
whirlpool staining the restless waters with
its reflection

  sim sprawled flat on his stomach facing
up-stream his rifle close beside him and
pretending to dabble aimlessly in the cur-
rent grasped the anchoring chain link by
link he slowly drew it in moving the raft
nearer the sand-bar the figures of sheriffs
hawkins and salyers were barely discernible
from the river

 tom boomed a determined voice
were going to strike a trade right here and
now do you still want that conley for
your prisoner

  a moments hesitation then from the
wolfe county bank

  wal i aint so particular as i was
since youre so sot on having him ill

wade out with you and help pull-

  the raft scraped the sand-bar sim
grasped his rifle and reached for the pile

  - wheres he gone to clint

  i dont- yes there he is run up
and cover him from your side quick
lets take him alive	j 

  among the branches of the fallen syca-
more a few rods up-stream there was a

sudden movement sim saw it let go of
the pile to have both hands for his rifle and
swayed erect as the raft swung backward
then he gave a wild hopeless cry

  a line of flame spurted from the syca-
more the report crashed along the re-
sounding water shattering the mountain
stillness sim staggered dropped his rifle
and clutched his breast

 frank mart-

  shut up bellowed clint hawkins
cant neither of us see clear enough to
bear witness who it is

  a pause while the hills muttered the fatal
echo

 anyway its happened on middle-
ground tom salyers added artfully not
in your county or mine and its pintedly
none of our business

  the raft ran the length of its chain and
stopped again over the crimson-stained
whirlpool a guttural groan a loud splash
and it floated free of human freight

  perched up a neighboring cove a whip-
poorwill whistled a tuneless requiem

  i reckon the conleys will have sort of a
hard time capturin him from old red river
there sheriff hawkins mused aloud
through the dusk one things certain
i aint going to be here to interfere

  me neither sheriff salyers declared
theres a late supper and a soft bed calling
me away for a spell wish youd go long
and enjoy em with me

  cant jest now tom but ill come
over some other day shore as i five
good night

  dont you forget that promise ill
be a-looking for you good night

ut-they tuk me off ut on a stritcher-old spud

thin brown line of the second

battalion of the -teenth

u s infantry extended as
skirmishers was advancing by
rushes up the long slope whose crest marked
the divide between the pasig and zapote
rivers companies d and e were covering
the rice fields to the right of the manila-
zapote road and f and g were splashing
through the mud and water of the recently
irrigated paddies at the left

  walking briskly along the macadamized
road major john t morphy-old spud
to the rank and file of his command-was
keeping a sharp lookout giving orders
through the batallion adjutant lieutenant
miles turning from time to time to observe
the disposition of the rear guard or to con-
fer with captain potts in command of the
one battery of artilery that was jingling
and clanking along behind him

  already the main body of the insurgent
army in full retreat after their defeat in the
scrap at san pedro macati ridge the day
before had dropped below the divide an
occasional bullet from their rear guard in the
old trenches at the crest serving as a re-
minder that they intended to delay the
advance till the main body crossed over

  there was a quickening of pace along the
deployed line a slapping of haversacks
against thighs a rattle of tin cups against

canteens an occasional yell from the com-
panies on the flank now swinging in a scis-
sors movement to conform to the half-
moon of the bend in the river outlined by
the divide already a gap to theleft showed
where the flanking company in its anxiety
to get into position for the final rush at the
crest had advanced too fast

  halt blowhalt

  old spud did not intend to leave a single
sniper uncovered in the advance for snipers
had cost the lives of twenty of his wounded
men theday beforekilling the stretcher-
bearers as they bore their disabled comrades
to the rear leaving revoltingly mutilated
corpses pegged out on ant-hills as an exam-
ple of what the little brown brother can
do when really at his best

  the flanks slackened their pace for a mo-
ment quickening it again as soon as the gap
was narrowed the insurgent rear guard
four hundred yards away stuck sullenly to
their trenches pouring a hot fire into the
american lines clipping the grass from the
low dikes that outlined the paddies an
occasional bullet finding its billet either in
the infantry or in the artillery already be-
ginning to deploy to right and left of the road

  -to -- mr miles see the divvils

  old spud was doing a bit of double time
unmindful of the increasing spurts of dust
thrown by the insurgent bullets as they
dropped closer and closer in the road the

fight

eo foster


old spuds last fight



old man was in his element he was happy
as a cannoneer just promoted gun corporal
for two years he had campaigned around
the philippine islands always looking for
a scrap-a real scrap that would enable him
to affix another battle-name to the regi-
ments flag ordered before a retiring-board
ten days later this would be his last chaftce
before he was placed on the shelf

shall i have the bugler blow recall
the adjutant was limping a bit already
a mauser bullet had clipped through his
legging and shoe grazing the ankle-bone
and taking a bit of skin with it

   recall ye moight as will blow church
call in hades for all the attention thim
hill-roarers o mine wud pay to ut

  old spud had the scent of powder in his
nostrils he knew the terrane ahead of him
and felt sure that the main body of the
insurgents already were across the zapote
ready to make another stand

 no - ut till him to blow the

char-rge well clane thot chrest ahid
and see whots on the ither soide niver

moind thot bugle niver moind-

  the major had spotted the first platoon of
the left company as it swung in and turned
the flank of the insurgents sending them
helter-skelter down the three-hundred-yard
slope to the bridge he hurried forward
following the road as it led through the cut
that lowered it below the level of the crest

   sche-e-e-wj menaced a three-inch shell
as it ricochetted from the hard macadam
the bam-hrrrupmh of its exposition
jarring the atmosphere and sending a cloud
of shrapnel over the rear guard

  blow halt blow halt 

  the major threw himself flat as the wind
of another shell lifted his campaign hat and
stirred the gray thatch that outlined his
wrinkled forehead the old boy rolled
to the edge of the road and worked his way
up the embankment to the shelter of a
clump of bushes on the right closely fol-
lowed by the adjutant and bugler he
looked up and down the line his men
already were under cover sniping at the
insurgents hidden behind the breastworks
on the opposite side of the river

  the rear guard had halted and were al-
ready lying prone in the shelter of a dike
he smiled grimly as he saw gunner after
gunner fall around the insurgent cannon
three hundred yards was pie for the
sharpshooters of the siccond

  the battery already was wheeling its
guns into position ready to try conclusions
with the enemy things were going well
it would be only a matter of a few minutes
until the enemys guns were silenced and
then hed show them a trick or two a little
trick like pouring in a red-hot fire another
advance by rushes and a drive across the
bridge and then-cold steel

  the jar of an explosion shook the ground
beneath him even before he heard the report
and saw the center pier of the old stone
bridge go hurtling skyward before the
last bit of debris had splashed its way to the
deep bottom of the sluggish stream he was
up on his feet sweeping the terrane with
his glasses seeking a way to move his living
pawns so as to mate this last check

  it was no easy task that confronted the
old warrior he was too good a soldier to
waste his men needlessly and too good
a fighter to lay doggo for hours until re-
enforcements could cross the river where it
debouched into manila bay and attack the
enemys flank

  the insurgent fire dwindled beneath the
steady sweep of his mens rifles he could
see the insurgent officers walking up and
down their lines steadying their men
among them was the negro renegade who
had deserted from the u s forces two
months before to accept a commission as
colonel in the insurgent army the majors
jaws set their bony outline showing blue
against the day-old stubble

  whot oill do to thot - blackbur-rd

of a naygur  be plenty tis he thot
killed lawton-

  the burst of a shell near by drew his
attention to the job ahead

  awray to the left a group of white-clad
amigos were watching the scrap from the
roof of an old monastery in the right fore-
ground a herd of water-buffalo were feeding
knee-deep in a newly flooded paddy un-
mindful of the noise and tumult

  there came a sudden darkening of the
silver bowl of the sky a patter of rain and
then with a shriek and roar the tempes-
tuous baguio that had been lying in wait off
the coast swept down upon them the des-
ultory firing ceased the roar of heavens
artillery making sad mock of the puny
efforts of friend and foe

  morphy was dumfounded here was the
chance that he was looking for a chance to
strike a decisive blow at the enemy and


adventure

the river already rising by leaps and
bounds defeating his purpose a fine tale
indeed to report to headquarters to the
chief that had neglected to order out a com-
pany of engineers for such an emergency

  already the artillery was shifting its posi-
tion its horses stretched to the utmost as
they pulled the guns from the heavy mud of
the fields to the hard surface of the road in
the rear not a pontoon not a boat not
even a native dugout in sight a bad posi-
tion for the bist battalion of the bist
rigimint in the service to be in mechanic-
ally he wiped the dampness from his glasses
a suspicious moisture dimming his eyes as
he returned them to the case

bt the crash of a falling tree as it
p ks toppled from its trunk drew his
fci attention he walked in the direc-
tion of the sound edging through the sheets
of rain that flapped from the taut line of the
opaque sky as he drew nearer he could
hear the steady clip clip of axes com-
pany d was at work he could hear the
voice of the captain as he directed his men
in the work of trimming the thirty-foot bole
which lay before him as he stepped from
the gray of the storm into their midst

foine captain foine

  old spuds face was lighted like a christ-
mas tree as he got the idea

  stiddy as ye are till i for-rum the bat-
talion

  there was a running of orderlies a gather-
ing of company commanders a shifting of
men a clinking of trace-chains and before
the last tree was cut trimmed and loaded
two of the longest timbers lashed together
at their small ends and rigged with the
heavy block and tackle always carried by
the field artillery the siccond was
stretched out in column formation along the
road ready for the advance

  where in the name of the howly saint
pathrick is yer firrst platoon mr jansen
the majors temper was on hair edge now
that he was ready to go in

 what do ye mane by showin up minus

losin thot little bar that is diccoratin yer

 the major moved down the column
checking up as he went along telling the
different officers how to dispose of their men
so as to protect company d as it placed the
improvised shears in position to throw the
logs across the gap in the bridge ending al-
ways with the admonition to git in behind

thot company and drive across thot -

bridge the minute uts laid as if the diwil
himself were afther yez

  the rear guard had moved up and taken
position along the crest ready to answer any
fire directed against the advance all was
set and ready to go and still the major
withheld the word while the column shiv-
ered in dripping garments it was only a
small part of his command that was miss-
ing but missing it was and he did not like
to move until he knew where the stragglers
were they might be cut off prisoners
maybe with an insurgent horde slashing
them to pieces with bolo and creese they
might be lying secure in some coulee too
full of blue funk to raise their heads-but
he did not allow himself to dwell on such
a possibility his min were game

  came a crash of thunder and the rain
died away old spud ran to the crest of the
road and swept the right of the field below
with his glasses the missing men were
still missing the herd of water-buffalo
tails toward the wind were feeding close to
the river-bank five hundred yards away

  he could wait no longer with a motion
of his hand he gave the order to advance

  the wheel team on the caisson took up
the walk the trace-chains of the leaders
held in check almost touching the ground
their drivers gradually increasing the dis-
tance so that when the section commander
gave the signal trot the four horses
were pulling evenly they topped the crest
and at the command  gallop flew down the
long even slope as if on air the cannoneers
perched precariously on the timbers com-
pany d at double time behind them

  to the right and left the other companies
deploying again as skirmishers advanced by
rushes down the muddy slope lying down
and firing alternately holding partly in
check the enemys fire the reserve lying
old spuds last fight



prone their rifles held steady by the slings
poured a steady fire into the enemys
cannoneers it looked like an easy victory
a walk-over already the men of d were
cheering as they slid the shears to the edge
of the break and ran out the guy ropes
the first log suspended from the tackle
began moving slowly forward at their urge
to be dropped into place at lafraynes signal

  the major a hundred yards back was
sweeping the field with his glasses again
everything was going right but that lost
platoon bothered him on the right the
water-buffalo were milling he gazed
steadily at them a smile was just begin-
ning to break the wrinkles on his ruddy
cheeks when the shock of another explosion
almost lifted him from his feet he gazed
in horror as he saw the bodies of the men
on the bridge twist and writhe in the
ascending debris of the second span and
straighten and quiver as they shot to earth
or splashed into the zapote

  cursing like a pirate he ran forward to
assist his officers in re-forming the men he
helped drag the shattered bodies of the
detachment into cover he had done his
best now he was going to do his-est

  up and down the line he raged like a
caged tiger unmindful of the bullets that
sang and spat and whistled around him
hed fight it out now if it took every man
he had and his men seeing red with rage
were of the same opinion and began to shed
their garments ready to swim the river

  stiddy min stiddy tis me thot lid
ye into this trap and tis not for yez to be
taking such chances till the roight momint
comes hauld em now make the dirty
haythin keep their lousy hids down till we
git anither thry at thim

  already he had sent runners back to the
battery with the word to bring up new ma-
terial for the two spans now necessary
there was still a chance

  again the storm broke in all its fury
the major saw the water-buffalo plunge
into the stream the first sweep of the rain
cutting the hindmost from view as it
plunged into the swirling torrent was that
oleary hanging to the tail of the first
animal

  the rattle of the caissons coming with the
new timbers broke through the storm as
they drew nearer the enemy unable to see
them opened up again and as usual fired
too high to stop their approach again the

shears were run into place the concentrated
fire of two companies keeping the enemy
from gaining control of the bridgehead
the first break was bridged and the shears
were being legged fonvard to the second
gaping hole when a lucky shot from one of
the enemys guns fired point blank knocked
them into smithereens

  in the confusion that followed the insurg-
ents placed sandbags across the farther
bridgehead and settled down to the job of
keeping the structure swept clean the
heavy mud in the surrounding fields kept
the artillery from deploying and they could
not fire over the heads of the survivors of
company d

  it seemed an age before another pair of
shears was in place and slipping falling
cut to ribbons by rifle fire the first detach-
ment started across old spud raging like
a demon his revolver spitting like an angry
wildcat at their head they were met
half-way by an insurgent detachment the
negro renegade at their head their rush
drove the americans back

  with half the first company down the
officers ordered the men off the bridge pull-
ing the major from the grip of the black
struggling in the grasp of his officers
threatening them with everything from a
general court martial to eternal hellfire the
major went berserk with a yell for volun
teers he broke from the friendly hands of
his subordinates and started across the
bridge again like unleashed bulldogs f
company followed

  above the noise of the storm came the
clashing of steel the sough of the bayonet
as it sank deep into flesh the suck of the
weapon jerked forth as white met brown
bayonet against bolo and like the meeting
of the tides the froth of the apex locked
in death grips slid slithering into the river
tinging its muddy current with swirling
blood the major cool again cool as the
barrel of the empty pistol the negro was
snapping in his face moved to one side
crowding his adjutant back pivoted and
swung on the receding jaw of the negro
he might as well have hit an ox

  with a yell the renegade clasped old
spud around the body and began tightening
his arms in a boa-like grip try as he would
the major could not break the hold back
of him his men were trying to shove their
bayonets past his body into the black one
of them hacking at the gorilla-like fists 


adventure

  he felt a ripple of unconsciousness begin
its stealthy creep upward the stygian
tide lapped at his knees slapped his waist
clutched at his heart

  he heard faintly the sound of american
cheers to the right of the insurgent trenches
he wondered if the men of the old monitor
monterey anchored off paranacque had
heard the firing and were coming to the
rescue he choked-and suddenly he felt
the giant arms slacken and fall from his
sides like lead

  above the pounding of his heart as it be-
gan pumping fresh blood through his con-
gested lungs he heard the bull-like roar of
sergeant oleary commanding the lost
platoon as he pulled his bayonet from be-
tween the renegades shoulders he felt
the spatter of blood as the dying negro
coughed in a last despairing effort to clear
his lungs he caught a glimpse of the
hideous blubber-like lips that had been
gibbering in his face a moment before they
turned a sickly brownish-green as the body
toppled suddenly sidewise into the river

 oleary -yer sowl- the majors

words came haltingly-whot the diwil do
yez mane by quittin the command tis a

giniral court ye should have-

  old spuds eyes filled with tears the
strain had been too severe and for once in
his life he could not hide his real nature

one night at osaba

edwin gole

                  author of the call of the whippoorwill to quit my post etc

ergeant johnson was
taking his platoon down the
osaba trail it was his first
patrol and he was a proud man
also he had a sufficient sense of his responsi-
bilities for hitherto in that wild country

where the mountains of arizona jostle those
of mexico no detail of x troop had gone
forth without an officer or the top sergeant
in charge

but the captain and the second lieutenant
had ridden over to headquarters at nogales
one night at osaba



on company business the lieutenant was
in charge of camp and lawton the top
sergeant was off with some rangers on a
cattle-rustler hunt

  so johnson had been given the detail and
now he rode at the head of his sixteen
troopers with instructions to make the
osaba mine by nightfall and investigate a
complaint of its manager that certain un-
desirable citizens of mexico had come over
the border and were stirring up discontent
among his mexican operatives

  the trail followed the valley of arivaca
creek for several miles and then left it for
the mountains to the south it was late
afternoon and the detail had put the passes
behind them and were dropping down into
an extensive hollow in the hills at the bot-
tom of which lay the little mining settle-
ment of osaba beside the artificial pond that
furnished it power

  sergeant johnson had taken scouting
formation out of caution a point of two
men rode a few hundred yards ahead and
in the rear another pair followed at a
slightly shorter distance

  the walls of the canon through which the
platoon was passing rose steeply to the
shoulders of mountains on either side
there was nothing of beauty in these
mountains they were bare rock of tor-
tured shapes to which clung here and there
the hardy mesquite and the prickly cactus
yet the heat of the semi-tropic day was
passing the sky was a flawless turquoise
and the air vital

  it was good to be alive the sergeant re-
flected to have these fine men and horses
under his charge to be on an important
errand

  a turn and dip in the trail exposed the
settlement to his view the pond lay like a
great round blue eye far below him about
it squatted like doll houses the mine build-
ings to one side the scars in the moun-
tain indicated an upper shaft of the mine
he had been on this patrol before under the
second lieutenant he remembered that
then smoke rose from those diminutive
buildings now they lay as if deserted

  beside the sergeant rode one of his cor-
porals it was his first sight of the osaba
and he exclaimed in delight at the picture
for about the shores of the artificial pond
grass had sprung up and from this distance
looked like a lovely meadow

  almost as good as new england he

  

  exclaimed you wouldnt think this coun-
try could look so peaceful

  as the sergeant was about to answer
there came the sound of a distant popping
to their ears the point ahead came
riding back

  theres shooting going on down there
sergeant reported one of the men we
could see puffs of smoke from below the
dam

  sergeant johnson stiffened in his saddle
shooting he had not counted on that
his officers had not else they would have
sent a bigger force and one of them have
taken charge of it was he taking his men
into battle

  drop back in the line he ordered the
point 

  he signaled the trot with his closed fist
and the detail clattered down the rocky
bed of the canon

  the settlement was hidden from their
sight again by the walls of the winding
canon then they came out into the valley
a mile or so above the pond the shots
sounded louder now and the sergeant gave
the signal to gallop

  they reached the upper end of the pond
and followed the sandy trail along its shore
the sergeant could see figures crouched be-
hind the nearer end of the dam now they
were using it as a breast-work and were
shooting down the valley beyond a bullet
sang over their heads another splashed
in the pond beside them

  then came a joyous shout from the de-
fenders at the dam the shooting ceased
there and only desultory firing sounded
from beyond

  the sergeant led his platoon behind the
shelter of the mine buildings and the
manager stepped forward grim and anxious
of countenance but patently relieved at the
reenforcements

  glad to see you he said grimly

  he was a short wiry man with fighting
blue eyes and he carried a winchester that
looked as if it had seen use

  bunch of greasers came up the valley
and scared my men off-all but these
welshmen he added nodding toward a
handful of grimy white men armed like
himself with rifles

  they sent word that they wanted ten
thousand dollars back pay and if they
didnt get it theyd dynamite the dam and
help themselves i told them to go ahead


adventure

  sergeant johnson ordered his men to dis-
mount and keep themselves and their horses
under cover

  suppose theyll beat it now they know
we are here he said regretfully

  not so sure of that retorted the
manager theyve got some of villas old
army down the valley i understand and
they mean to have a show-down

  well there are more where we came
from grinned the sergeant if they are
needed

  trouble is they know that and the big
show will be tonight answered the man-
ager more gravely they were getting
ready to rush us when you showed up
we wondered what made them change their
minds the last minute they must have
seen you coming before we did they had
snipers up on the hillside

  well lets look around and see what our
defenses are suggested the sergeant

  night was coming on fast it had dark-
ened appreciably since the patrol had
reached the valley

  the great hills threw the valley into an
ever deepening shadow above these
spread the lurid colors of an arizona sunset
beautiful but unreal laid on with too lavish
a brush

  the looking-around was done mostly
from the concealment of the shoulder of the
dam this stretched a smooth crown of
concrete a hundred yards across the narrow
crevice of the valley below it the valley
widened and fell sharply away all about
the pond rose a barrier of mountains

  whats to hinder the mexicans from
climbing up there and shooting down on
us the sergeant asked pointing to the
mountains

  nothing but whatll we be doing in the
mean time retorted the peppery miner
theres mighty little cover on those hill-
sides in the daytime and at night we can
fire at their flashes no theyll come up
the valley when they come there are
plenty of mesquite thickets and boulders
down there what im afraid of is that
some one of them will sneak up with a few
sticks of dynamite and touch it off at the
base of the dam we can enfilade em in
the daytime but at night they might get
away with it

  then it looks to me as though we ought
to stand guard at the base of the dam said
the sergeant

  coombs threw him a quick glance
sure he answered dryly thats the
proper move-but who are you going to
find to do it and take a chance of going up
or going under according to whether they
get the blast before the dam goes

  ive got sixteen men who will do it the
sergeant replied promptly

  the miner shook his head

  i wouldnt have the heart to ask them
he announced finally

  you dont have to i reckon its our
job retorted the sergeant

  now the manager protested

 it aint worth the price he said
let em blow up the dam theyll put
themselves out of a job and somebody back
east will lose a dividend thats better
than losing a score of good lives

  i dont figure on losing either an-
swered the sergeant our jobs to protect
life and property how would i look going
back and telling the captain that i didnt
do it for fear of getting hurt

  coombs threw up his hands hopelessly
have your own way theres no use
arguing with a soldier he gets a few dol-
lars a month for taking a chance of getting
killed and hes sore if he doesnt get the
chance you can do it he declared and
if you are fool enough to try it why im fool
enough to go with you ill send a half-
breed back to your camp with any word
you want one of your own men would
probably be gobbled up

 and so it was settled the sergeant
scribbled a note to the lieutenant telling him
the situation and it was sent off by the
loyal half-breed as soon as he could get
away under the cover of darkness then
the platoon led by coombs himself filed
down a path to the creek-bed below the dam

  the sergeant posted his men at intervals
with instructions to take what cover they
could and shoot on sight any one approach-
ing from down the valley coombs had
left his watchmen and a few trusty mexi-
cans to guard the buildings and the horses
he and the sergeant took up the post of
danger at the center of the dam

  it was like being at the bottom of a well
the face of the dam rose steeply behind
them the lofty mountains shut off the
horizon on all sides above the stars
shone with unreal brilliance and so deep
was the gloom of the creek-bottom that the
sergeant could not make out the guard on
one night at osaba



either side of him had he been right
after all in letting his men take such
chances he wondered

  well he could not back out now in any
case that would be showing the white
feather he must make the best of it

  and after a time he found that by keeping
his eyes fixed before him and away from the
stars his horizon broadened he could
distinguish now a clump of mesquite
darker than the surrounding gloom some
fifty yards down the canon he had the
feeling that he could detect any movement
between his station and this

  coombs sat within arms reach his back
to the dam winchester on his knees

  if id remembered i couldnt smoke
down here id never have agreed to come
he grumbled once in a hoarse whisper

  the night wore on a coolness settled
down in the canon bottom that made john-
son wish he had ordered the men to bring
their blankets once a stone was dis-
lodged to his right and he grasped his
springfield tensely waiting for an alarm
but none came and he relaxed doubtless
a careless trooper he concluded

  he glanced curiously at coombs the
miners attitude suggested that he had
gone to sleep his head hung forward and
his body was slouched tired out the
sergeant thought

  off on some hillside a coyote barked it
was answered from the opposite side of the
valley the sergeant pricked up his ears
was it a coyote or was it a signal

  but the fight was improving the clump
of mesquite stood out more distinctly
it seemed nearer it was nearer

  sergeant johnson had never read mac-
beth he had never heard of the forest of
dunsinane but as he sat there tensely
with his eyes glued to the thicket before
him it dawned on him that this age-old
strategem was being played part of that
thicket was moving toward him

  he covered it with his rifle and waited
could he trust his own eyes he dared not
nudge his companion if coombs indeed
slept his awakening might give premature
warning to the enemy was it not his
imagination after all yes it must be for
there was no further movement

  then to his left at the base of thedam
came the flare of a match the sergeant
swore one of his men lighting a cigaret
against his express orders he would see

about that he strode angrily toward the
light it was a mere flicker now but
enough to draw fire at any moment it
must be a pipe the man was lighting

  what are you doing there the sergeant
called in a hoarse whisper

  his answer was the sound of running feet
he in turn ran forward the fight sput-
tered on

   it all came to him in a flash now

  under the cover of the mesquite boughs
a mexican had worked to within a few
yards of the dam and then wormed up to it
with the dynamite the match was a fuse

hit could hardly be called delib-
erate bravery that actuated the
sergeants next move he had no
recollection later of reasoning the thing out
although he did remember visions of a
toppling dam and twenty-five feet of water
sweeping over him

  he sprang forward there lay the
wicked stick faintly outlined in the light
of its fuse tucked neatly against the base
of the dam he caught it up and hurled it
with all the strength of his good right arm
in the wake of the hurrying footsteps
there followed a long moment of suspense
and then--cataclysm

  hurled back against the wall of the dam
he saw the valley vomit fire his ear-
drums were filled to bursting with sound-
the end of the world had come was his
thought

  out of the black void that followed he
heard the voice of the miner it seemed far
away-a mere squeak yet his brain formed
the words

  youre not hurt are you the miner
was asking anxiously

  the sergeants senses came slowly back
he put his hand to the back of his head and
felt a tremendous bump then bp got
to his feet

  so that was what it was he said
the dynamite

  ill say it was agreed the miner
chuckling i dont know whether it was
enough to break the dam or not but im
glad we didnt have a chance to find out
lets see how your men came through it

  they made the rounds together there
was no one seriously hurt although some of
the men had suffered minor bruises from
flying stones

  after inspecting the guard the sergeant


adventure

and coombs returned to their posts but
the mexicans had shot their bolt the
remainder of the night passed without
incident

  with dawn the sergeant led his detail
back to the mine buildings one of
coombs spies was awaiting him there and
babbledfsomething in spanish to the miner

  they have beat it coombs explained
and their leader has gone for good he

added with grisly humor it seems he got
in the way of the dynamite

  as sergeant johnson stood talking with
him one of the guard shouted joyously-
corporal of the guard-armed party
johnson looked in the direction of the
call and a lump rose in his throat for he
saw the red-and-white guidon of the troop
it had made an all-night march and was
defiling out of the trail into the valley

  kenaston shut off his motor and gave a
quick spin to the wheel ford at the bow
made fast to an overhanging branch and
the boat after nosing gently among the
roots drifted the full length of its painter
swinging around in the sluggish current
at last it came to rest broadside-on to the
steep shore of a wide sandy bar the
flaming aftermath of the tropic sun faded
rapidly to purple and gray

  ford dropped at once to the cockpit and
began to forage in one of the forward lockers
he brought forth cold steamed rice in a
big pan and several blackened strips of dried
swine-meat these he regarded with a look
of utter disgust

chucks rotten he snarled cant
make a go of it on any such muck as that
having delivered himself of this fuming
comment he fell into a sullen contemplation

of his companion tugging at a small tar-
paulin

  kenaston finished his task he tied down
the comers of the canvas and stood erect
wiping the oil and grease from his hands

  wont be too long now he countered
cheerfully three-four days at the most
and well be back in merauke

 yah merauke scornfully fords
smoldering wrath seemed to burst into
flame meraukell be fine when we get
there but that aint goin to make up for
the swill ive ad to put into me ever since
i come out with you

  ive been eating the same grub said
kenaston quietly

 you what do you count youre
nothin but a poor fool an a baby an-an
a thievin miserly yank kenastons lips
tightened and paled but he made no retort

  the two men were an oddly assorted pair
even innew guinea where extremes meet
from all the ends f the earth kenaston
was a young american small and wiry and
ford was new zealand born-a man well
partners



beyond forty heavily bearded and power-
fully put together but the oddness lay
more in the types than in physique the
americans alert quiet manner and cool gray
eyes afforded a sharp contrast to the swash-
buckling speech and appearance of his older
companion

  three months earlier when kenaston
drifted in from singapore with a small stake
and a firm determination to increase tljt
stake in the bird of paradise game he had
found that all the hunters were far away in
the interior for it was then the height of
the season unaccustomed as he was to
the jungle it would have been madness for
him to venture alone against the dangers
and hardships of the river he had just
about made up his mind to wander along
to australia until the following year when
chance threw him in with ford

  the big new zealanders reputation in
merauke was anything but savory at the
very least he was known as a veteran hun-
ter gone wrong-a hanger-on in low chinese
saloons who was lodged and supported by
a javanese woman in a miserable bamboo
shack on the water-front kenaston how-
ever was very anxious to learn the ropes
as soon aspossible so despite the earnest
warnings of a few gray-bearded merchants
he worked upon ford until that beach-
combing individual agreed to lay his ex-
perience with the new-comers money for
half-shares in a short late-season excursion
close to the coast

  their outfit was scant for it turned out
that kenastons pocket-book alone could
not stand the strain of more than bare
necessities but although certain defi-
ciencies in armament and rations had been
the cause of a great deal of harsh recrimina-
tion from ford there really had been no
reason for complaint good fortune had
been with them from the start and for all
the shortness of their stay in the interior
they were now returning to merauke with
bags that would do credit to far prouder
expeditions

  ford had proven himself a surly enough
companion but he was a hard worker and
well-versed in the ways of the jungle
kenaston had soon marked him an ill-
tempered swaggering bully but with char-
acteristic generosity had laid it all to the
mans sudden enforced abstinence from
liquor

  he was not in the least unnerved by his

 partners heavy growls and threats but he
 had continually avoided making matters
 worse by joining in any wordy wrangling
 all he wanted was enough experience to be
 able to put up a sound proposition to one
 of the better hunters for the following
 season and enough money to hold up his
 end properly

   ford was evidently meditating on their
 luck as he slouched on the deck of the cock-
 pit he cast his eye from time to time at
 the five-gallon kerosene tins which held
 thpir skins

   ten thousand bloomin guilders in
 birds he mused aloud

   kenaston was secretly overjoyed at this
 sudden shift from unreasonable rage to
 sulky satisfaction the big man was ever
 changeable in his moods

   itd keep one man like a bloomin toff
 for moren a year he went on half-
 whining

   weve done mighty well thanks to
 you kenaston agreed heartily

   he squatted native-fashion on the deck

   you can just bet its thanks to me
 came the unlooked-for savage reply you
 aint done enough on this trip to pay yer
 board-even this rotten board we got ere

   fords heel shot out viciously and sent
 the pan of rice flying across the deck

   the contention was an absurd and de-
 liberate falsehood and the childish waste of
 food made kenastons blood boil but he
 checked himself and picked up what was
 unspilled of the food

   ill just get my supper down old man

  before you lose your temper

   whats your kick anyway he con-
 tinued coolly you knew what you were
 up against before you signed on and
 youll make enough to retire on when we
 get these birds off to makassar-retire or
 outfit yourself for next season

   next season with who you
adventure

  not with me ford the american an-
swered calmly not if i can help it but
i would though im not afraid of you you
know sometimes i think youd make a
good partner if youd get the alcohol out
of your system

  ford did not answer nor could kenaston
determine whether it was cowardice in the
face of cool opposition or feebly sparkling
honest conscience that made the new
zealander hold his peace and the next
maneuver only added to his puzzlement
ford turned again to the locker and pro-
duced a bottle of square-face gin

  what dye say to a drink he asked
gruffly cordial

  kenastons heart sank but his tone was
friendly as he answered

  sure whered you get it

  never mind where i got it theres
plenty more where that come from

  but kenaston thought he now under-
stood the half-hidden bartering that had
taken place that afternoon at a native
village he was more than a little worried
by this new complication for he could
imagine what gin would do to the already
disgruntled old-timer it would be useless
though to remonstrate so he pretended to
join in heartily hoping to be able to cut
short this unexpected drinking bout

  he took two drinks in the course of fifteen
minutes while ford sat silently and con-
sumed two cupfuls then he made his way
aft to stretch his blankets he lighted a
final cigaret and lay down on the deck
but the continual chink of bottle against
cup came from the bow and he knew that
ford was still drinking

  hey ford he hailed at last amicably
put it away why dont you we have to
turn out early you know

  shut yer mouth was the angry re-
sponse aint no blasted yankee miser
goin to tell me what to do an ill turn
out in the mornin if i want to

  oh all right disgustedly i dont
care

  ford laughed bitterly

  huh maybe ye dont care catch
you darin to leave me behind for a day
yed come back to find me gone-me an
the ole bloomin outfit

  kenaston bounded to his feet he felt
that the man was mouthing half-pondered
plans and decided that it might be a good
idea to put a few things straight his words

were rapped out steely-sharp as he stood
over his recumbent partner

  look here ford ive stood a lot of talk
from you this trip but dont you run away
with the idea youve got my goat i dont
want trouble-and any trouble between
us is going to be with guns get me talk
if you want to-much good itll do you-
but the minute you try any monkey busi-
ness with this boat or with the birds ill
fill you so full of lead youll think youre
a hardware shop just you chew on that

  and he turned back to his blankets
leaving ford cursing under his breath

ford was very glum in the morn-
ing he swallowed his rice and hard-
tack and tea without a word and
shouldering his rifle he strode away up-
stream between the mangroves and the
dark edge of the jungle kenaston plunged
directly into the forest following an in-
distinct animal-trail

  the partners were then skimming over
the ground they had hunted on their way
up the river six weeks before kenastons
allotment for the day was a tree which
stood in the center of a small natural clear-
ing about two miles back from the stream
the birds were very shy several hours
elapsed after a shot before they would be
sufficiently recovered from their fright to
return to their favorite roost

  bird of paradise hunters can usually de-
pend upon three or four victims from one
flock in the course of a long tropic day
the requirements are infinite spartan-like
patience in heat and discomfort and con-
siderably more than ordinary skill with a
 caliber rifle jim kenaston was amply
endowed with both these attributes and
set about his work with quiet zeal

  but shortly after midday when he had
retrieved his second bird from under the
dancing-tree and was strolling back to
his hiding-place to wait for another shot
he stopped quite involuntarily and gazed
around him into the gloomy depths of the
jungle the vague presentiment of lurking
danger that had been with him for the last
half-hour gripped all the more strongly as
he scanned the shadowy mazes of ferns and
entwining creepers

  got the feeling one of those black boys
is watching me he muttered he twitched
his shoulders and scowled

  half-unconsciously in his tense survey
partners

of the encircling thickets he crouched to
traverse on his hands and knees the
twenty feet that separated him from the
rotting log where lay his water-bottle be-
fore his knees pressed to the rank gray moss
underfoot he heard the unmistakable
vibrant buzz of a blow-gun dart singing
past his ear	

  his subsequent movements were des-
perately hurried but by no means panicky
sudden emergencies were not new to kenas-
ton long experience out of doors had
trained his muscles and his brain to react
promptly to any hint of surprize he
wheeled and dodged from cover to cover
zigzaging across the clearing to the lone
tree which had so lately shaken beneath
a garish cataract of birds

  flinging himself flat in the lush under-
growth he fired three times in the direction
from which he had come there was very
small chance that the random bullets would
damage his assailant but he knew by report
that the untutored papuans were awesomely
afraid of firearms and could often be halted
by a noisy show of resistance

  there came no answering cry of pain or
defiance after the fusillade nor any move-
ment of foliage so kenaston settled down
to await developments his position was
decidedly precarious if the unseen marks-
man was alone there was no danger of an
open attack but it was entirely possible
that the thickets swarmed with savages who
could easily overpower one man in a sudden
rush and ever there remained the dread
menace of the cruel blow-gun

  dam funny he thought to himself
these chaps around here are supposed to
be tame man i dont like those arrows

  kenaston knew what it was to be the
target of a hidden foe in a white mans
country but this was something new the
thought of the deadly poisoned darts that
could leave a man blackened and distorted
after half an hour of agony filled him with
that horrifying fear of the unknown that
no leaden bullets had ever been able to
summon

  the river was two miles distant it was
hardly possible that the noise of his un-
wonted succession of shots had penetrated
the thick blanket of wilderness to warn his
partner in a way this thought was com-
forting he did not want the other man
to come stumbling into the same ambuscade
that was now threatening him for a little

while he lay very still then parted the gras
in front of his face there was no sign of
life in his green surroundings

  the sun unhindered by the bare branches
above him drove its fierce rays through the
heavy cloth of his khaki coat myriad tiny
ants tortured with their strong jaws and he
was uncomfortably aware that two or three
wood-leeches had entered at his belt to
fasten themselves on his bare legs but his
worst torment was nervous burning thirst
he thought of his water-bottle at the edge
of the clearing with hot regret

  a quarter of an hour passed while kenas-
ton kept close watch all around and con-
sidered the situation restlessly it was
quite possible that there had been no more
than one papuan who had dared a single
shot and then glided away

  and if hes still here the big brutel
get me after dark anyway he thought

  indeed were there no savages at all the
prospect of a night alone in the black heart
of the jungle was enough to bring pause even
to a seasoned old veteran running the
gantlet would be preferable to this torturing
inaction waiting only made his position less
secure

  he looked to his rifle vainly wishing for
a more deadly caliber there was of
course a - winchester stowed away in
one of the lockers of the motor-boat
scrimping and close figuring on their equip-
ment had enabled the partners to purchase
this weapon for use against larger game than
birds and to serve as a protection in the
improbable event of trouble with the
natives but three nights before kenaston
had shot away the last cartridges on a wild
swine

  very cautiously now he drew his knees
up under him just as he was about to
spring to his feet he felt a dull thud against
his sun-helmet ducking quickly below the
grass screen he slid one hand over the brim
of his hat quivering fingers drew forth a
dart-slim pencil of death-from just above
the puggaree

  whew he breathed i better move
didnt know they could carry this far

  he threw all caution to the winds and
made a swerving dash for the far side of the
clearing muttering angrily under his
breath he dropped behind a thick trunk
and scanned the opposite thickets

  then reconstructing in his mind his
former position and judging by the direction


adventure

the dart had taken in his helmet he was
able to form a fair idea of where the enemy
lurked twenty yards frontage of fern
seemed to conceal the spot he ventured
two or three searching shots

  he knew that he was now out of range of
the blow-gun and must expect the hidden
papuan to change his position the
shortest and surest arc around the clearing
was at the corner where the trail debouched
kenaston kept sharpest watch on that side

  and it was not long before his eye was
rewarded by a slight movement of leaves
deep in the green curtain quick as light-
ning he leveled his rifle and pumped four
shots at the disturbance a hoarse cry of
pain was his answer-and the heavy sound
of a big body falling

  got ye you big savage kenaston
exulted as he leaped to his feet

  but he controlled his impetuosity and
sank again to his concealment

  not going over to see you mr papuan
he muttered you may have friends
anyway these  slugs are not so very
potent and i dont want to risk any more of
your little presents ill just slope i think

  acting on his earlier determination he
made a wild dodging dash diagonally from
his shelter to the path there was no out-
cry as he fled nor did tattooed warriors rise
to oppose him he heard no hiss of venom-
ous dart as his speeding feet hit the soft
black soil of the trail kenaston however
did not linger in his flight

  at the end of a breathless mile as he
panted up a steep incline he realized that
he was not being followed he slowed to a
rapid walk-until the plain print of a naked
foot heading away from the river brought
him up short

  for a moment he stared fascinated at
the fan-like spread of the toes a sudden
apprehension flashed across his mind

  the boat he gasped and hurried on

  but presently when he burst out into
the glaring sunshine of the river-bank he
saw their battered craft floating apparently
unmolested at the edge of the bar he
searched carefully for further trace of the
footprints but there was none in the sand
if the savage had come near the boat at
all he had contented himself with spying
from the shelter of the thicket

  kenaston was convinced by now that he
had to do with a prowling lone native-who
had got a lesson for his temerity-so he

clambered aboard and started to throw to-
gether their meagre supper he wondered
what ford would say to his adventure

  i dark approached however and
j	ford did not come back to the boat

lmi it was altogether unusual for either
of the partners to be still in the jungle after
an hour before sundown so kenaston began
to have an uneasy misgiving that his part-
ner too had fallen in with hostile blacks
and perhaps had come out second best

  very much undecided as to the course he
should pursue he made his way up-stream
for a mile or more until he came to the place
where fords shod trail left the open to
follow a path through a vast ironwood
grove kenaston did not hesitate for all
the lateness qf the hour he plunged into the
gloom of the forest until the quick fall of
night made it impossible to go any farther

  he stayed there for an hour shouting and
firing off his rifle at intervals but no an-
swering signal came back from the dark

  after countless stumbles and falls and
wanderings from the path he made his way
to the stream as he emerged from the
ironwoods a distant gleam of light from
across the lowlands reminded him of the na-
tive village where his partner had got the gin

  those blackbirds there are at the bottom
of this he decided heres where i find
out if it costs me my head

  deliberately laying his plan of action he
sped back to the boat

  he felt very much as if he were running
his head into a lions throat as he started
his engine and turned into the current he
knew only a few words of the scant papuan
language and he knew full well that one
man with a  rifle would be of small avail
against an onslaught of treacherous blacks
but his heart was cold with anger he was
determined to leave no stone unturned in
finding and punishing the miscreants who
were responsible for the non-appearance of
his partner

  he drove the bow of his motor-boat deep
into the muddy water-front of the straggling
thatched village two or three-score of
naked savages-warriors and women-left
the circle of fires and crowded to watch his
landing wondering at his own daring the
american leaped ashore and apparently un-
concerned strode through the midst of the
chattering spectators to the lighted com-
pound in the center of the huts
partners



   mombo he demanded sharply calling
 the name of the chief

   kenaston held his rifle ready and gazed
 around the circle of glistening faces

   the old man with whom ford had done
 his bargaining the day before squirmed out
 from between two stalwart giants and faced
 the white man in the open with his few
 words-and helped by elaborate signs-
 kenaston made known that he was looking
 for his partner

   the chief shook his head decidedly he
 had seen nothing of ford but the american
 was not to be put off so easily snatching
 off his hat he thrust it under the natives
 nose to show the hole made by the dart
 the old man looked at it and seemed to
 shrink then he broke out into a passionate
 discourse that was entirely incomprehensible
 to kenaston he gestured to the firelit ring
 of warriors and the white man remembered
 to look for the marks of recent wounds he
 found nothing

   suddenly he grasped the chief by the
 arm and signed for a tour of the houses
 every moment he expected to feel the hot
 stab of knife or arrow but he shoved the
 muzzle of his rifle against old mombos ribs
 and led the way

   very thoroughly he searched every house
 for some property of fords-his rifle his
 boots his coat-but without success two
 men with damar torches offered every pos-
 sible assistance

   puzzled and considerably worried he
 stood for a moment in the firelight he

	berated himself for his inexperience and his
 ignorance of the language there was noth- 
 ing he could do except continue his search
 in the morning the villagers were cer-
 tainly not hostile his attacker-the man
 who had probably accounted for poor old
 ford-might have been a strayed brave
 from some other village it struck him that
 he would be able to trail that chap in the
 morning by following the blood marks

   he went back to his boat four men
 shoved him clear of the mud and the whole
 village trouped along to speed his departure
 with weird friendly calls

in the morning early while he
was breakfasting he heard the faint
sound of a motor-boat chugging up
against the river he rose to his feet won-
dering for at this season he expected no
traffic away from merauke five minutes

later the boat rounded the bend and headed
straight for his beach kenaston could see
two white men in the stem and a javanese
machinist at the wheel

  britishers he decided as they drew
near

  hello shouted one youre kenaston
arent you

  yes very much surprized

  they told us in merauke that you were
here thought wed come up and have a
look-see my names haddon this is
strawbridge we came down only four days
ago but didnt see anything of you

  kenaston recognized the names as those
of two hunters he had heard mentioned
while waiting in the town he saw that the
men were worn and saffron-colored under
the tan from the fevers of the interior

  we were up a side creek four days ago
he told them

  oh to be sure wheres ford
casually

  in a few words the young american re-
lated the events of the preceding day-
told of his encounter in the clearing fords
disappearance and the visit to mombos
village he added that he was planning to
trail the wounded black

  so you nicked the bird who potted at
you asked haddon with a glance at his
companion

  i heard him scream and fall

  might not be a bad idea to follow him
up mind if we go along with you

  kenaston was only too pleased to have
assistance in his predicament the three
men struck into the forest strawbridge
strode along in front without a word while
haddon kept up an intermittent flow of
conversation with the american

  oh no he declared couldnt have
been any one from old mombos show
known him for years dear old thing
and when kenaston voiced his suspicion
that his assailant might have been from
some other village he replied really cant
say well see

  he expressed some surprize when his eye
fell on kenastons light rifle-asked whether
the partners had nothing heavier then he
nodded abstractedly as he listened to the
explanation

  the sunflecked clearing brought back to
kenaston unpleasant remembrances of yes-
terdays hurried encounter he could not
repress a slight shudder as he pointed across


adventure

the commissary in the hills

a complete novelette y max bonter

 author of the last trip down the pal with the number twelves etc

to the clump of ferns from which he had
heard the cry of pain they proceeded
warily around the edge of the open

haddon was first very soon he stopped
short and turned to kenaston

jove you nicked him right enough
plenty of blood here

 but the american had spied a dark object
 on the ground amid the crimson-spattered
 leaves

fords handkerchief he cried lord
they did get him

hm maybe haddon grunted lets
look

i ten feet farther they came across fords
body

 his glazed eyes stared up at the blue of
 heaven and the green of the jungle-un-
 seeing his feet were shoeless and in his

hand he gripped a long smooth blow-pipe
there were two tiny bullet wounds in his
breast

  but my god i dont understand
the cry was tom from kenastons ups

 haddon placed a hand on the young
mans shoulder

  its what we expected lad he said
very kindly half-shares wasnt enough
for him didnt dare chance it with a 
you see so he bartered for a blow-gun
mombod never know youre almighty
lucky really

  he gazed for a long moment at the body
then looked away his eyes were suddenly
old and tired

  ay lad he went on paradise feathers
have their tragedies same as gold and pearls
and all the rest

n early morning local shriek-
ing its way up-grade through the
alleghany mountains checked
its noisy course long enough
to discharge at drayton one passenger-
a young man with a suit-case-who sat
down upon his frail baggage and looked
curiously over the wild and picturesque
environment it was a country of bald

hills slashed with deep glens and watered by
purling streamlets over the jagged out-
lines of a scrub-capped precipice peeped the
rising sun a pure sweet breeze blew softly
over the hilltops

  the lone traveler emptied his lungs of the
vile smoking-car atmosphere and drank
deeply of the undefiled element about
him

the commissary in the hills copyright  by max banter
the commissary in the hills



  what a change from broadway he
exclaimed in grateful appreciation of
surrounding nature but where the deuce
is the camp

  drayton was merely a flag station-
a shed-like structure beside the track de-
signed apparently for the sinister employ-
ments of a colony of fat spiders the young
man was still sitting on his suit-case and
trying to puzzle a way out of his bewilder-
ment when he observed a lean slouchy-
looking individual moving leisurely toward
him along the railroad track the latters
glances strayed inquiringly over the new-
comers person and suit-case

  reckon yure the noo comsry-aint
yu he ventured deliberately soiling the
shining ball of the rail with a jet of tobacco
juice

  i guess youre right was the young
mans prompt admission

  wal th camps jist round that bend
im th crum boss ill take yu over an
interjooce yu

  while his pilot slouched along beside him
the new commissary clerk was vaguely
wondering

   crum boss what kind of a boss is
that what sort of an outfit have i butted
into anyway cant say i particularly
admire the guys looks either he doesnt
impress me as being the proper type of man
for a boss

  the railroad track curved about the base
of a red limestone crag beyond which
a tiny plateau discovered itself a short
spur of track led out across the plateau from
the main line and on the spur a small train
of box-cars was standing these cars
appeared to have been reconstructed into
dwellings and fitted up with some crude
jiving conveniences because stove-pipes
could be seen sticking through the roofs and
little square windows had been cut in the
sides of the cars

  three score overalled figures lounged
about the camp some were smoking corn-
cob pipes or cigarets but the faces of all
wore that unmistakable expression that
succeeds the consumption of food aha
what was this odor borne suddenly along by
the keen mountain breeze a queer pang
smote the new clerk below his belt he
sniffed

  liver and onions and fried potatoes he
audibly conjectured

  i spose yure hungry atter yur ride

  ventured the crum boss sympathetically
  wal yu wont have long t wait th
  gangs already et yull eat wit th cook
  an th flunkeys an me

    there followed a minutes silence during
  which the men gradually neared the little
  encampment but before they had arrived
  within ear-shot the crum boss remarked
  with an attempt at carelessness

    yure a noo guy here so i mights well
  tip yu off bout that hasher garvey dont
  say nuthin bout what im tellin yu but
  he had a run-in wit th other comsry an
  chased im outa camp

    he did eh responded the clerk dryly
  well the thing im principally interested
  in right now is his hash-not his disposition
  ill eat first and get chased out afterwards

  a gaping wonder dawned on the crum
 boss heavy face as he looked into the
 young mans twinkling eyes then hunch-
 ing his drooping shoulders into a shrug he
 led the way into the dining-car

    th noo comsry he announced with
  the hangdog air of one utterly unfamiliar
  with social niceties

   my names bolton supplemented the
 new arrival jack bolton

    three men seated at the breakfast table
  grunting some half-intelligible words of
  greeting in acknowledgment of the crude
  introduction proceeded with their meal
  bolton set down his suit-case and he and the
  crum boss added their persons to the gather-
  ing the new clerk adopted an attitude of
  instant friendliness toward the victuals with
  which the camp table was liberally supplied
  he filled his plate with the constituents of
  a substantial repast and devoured the liver
  and onions and fried potatoes and flapjacks
  and sirup with great gusto

    clerk rumbled the big gray-mustached
  man who sat at the head of the table with
  a trace of insolence in his tone yu brought
  alon a purty good appetite didnt yu
  the clerical man laid down his knife and
  fork wiped his lips sighed contentedly and
  then replied with a smile-

    cook i always do things that way
  bill garvey fixed his steel-gray eyes
  intently upon boltons while he pondered
  the significance of the remark

    make a clean-up yu mean he growled

	at length

    try to admitted the clerk quietly
  everything i tackle

   the two men continued looking across


adventure

the table at each other-the young clear-
eyed white-collared downy-cheeked clerk
and the old grizzle-faced rough-necked
camp cook the crum boss and the flunkeys
seemed to be ill at ease at last bill garvey
lifted his big frame yawningly from the
bench and grunted with an accompanying
wink at his flunkeys	

  wal i guess yull have some cleanin
up t do right away th last clerk left here
in a sorta hurry an things in th comsry
car aint igzackly what yud call tidy

  the flunkeys snickered

  very well-ill tidy things up returned
the clerk composedly is the place locked
bill garvey handed bolton a key

  ill show yu th car volunteered the
crum boss

  the first box car of the string-in other
words the car that lay nearest the main line
switch-proved to be the commissary car
bolton unlocked the door and entered in
one end were a narrow bunk and a small
desk the remaining space was devoted
entirely to the housing of supplies the
shelves were filled with canned goods of
every description as well as dried fruits
cereals and other varieties of foodstuffs
there were likewise boxes of tobacco cig-
arets shirts overalls socks shoes soap
and many other requisites for the use of
the gang on the floor were bags of coffee
rice beans flour vegetables etc

 but-what a mess many of the bags
and boxes had been overturned and much
of their contents lay scattered over the dirty
floor the desk had been canted over
upon its side pens ink pencils and blank
forms littered the surrounding floor space
an expression of amazement came into
boltons eyes

  what the deuce happened here he
muttered has this car been in a wreck
or what

  purty near a wreck aint it agreed the
crum boss with a broad grin this is th
way th other clerk left it atter him an
garvey had it out th clerk jist nachully
couldnt leave this camp fast enough

 but what was the trouble between
them demanded bolton pointedly

  they jist nachully couldnt git along
yes-but what seemed to be the chief
difficulty persisted the clerk directing
a keen look into the others shifty eyes

  the crum boss hesitated after having
spent some seconds in the rapid mastication

of a fresh chew of tobacco he replied looking
uneasily about him

  thats garveys way he jist nachully
cant git along wit nobody-speshully
a wite-collar guy

  he cant eh retorted bolton scorn-
fully well hed better begin to learn
how because hell have to get along with
me

  yu see went on the crum boss confi-
dentially with his eyes on the floor th
clerks sposed t run th camp but garveys
idee is that th cook runs it-see

  bringing this parley abruptly to an end
the new clerk threw off his coat and went to
work to make the car presentable and
habitable the crum boss found himself
suddenly in the way and a moment after-
ward took his departure

  this crum boss as he calls himself
doesnt impress me very strongly thought
bolton i think ill like the cook better-
he at least can look me in the eye

jim pidgin the tall raw-boned
proprietor of the little mountain inn
called the pidgin coop drew a
glass of beer and served the big man who
waited expectantly in front of the bar
pidgin was on the lookout for trade

  yu frum th camp over thar he ven-
tured with a half-leer that was designed to
represent a sociable smile

  im th cook responded the customer
shortly gulping his beer and promptly
ordering another

  the saloon-keeper was interested he
thoroughly inspected the culinary mans
person and then drawled-

  didnt git them flippers kneadin dough
-did yu

  garvey spread his brawny bare arms
comfortably over the bar and lazily drank
the second glass of beer

  no-i didnt quite git em slingin
hash he admitted while a slight flicker of
pride showed in his deep-set eyes

  whats th matter with all yore fellers
over thar-dont they ever take a drink
pursued pidgin i see em goin out t
work evry day an cornin back agin but
i dont ever see em cornin round t buy
a beer

  an amused twinkle wiped some of the
surliness out of the big cooks gaze

  why he explained th outfits only
been here about ten days these gandys
the commissary in the hills



only get paid once evry two weeks they
aint had a pay day since theyve been here
theyre all broke-savvy so yu think
a gandy dont drink

  garvey laughed suddenly it was a roar-
ing good-natured guffaw that made the
little bar-room tremble

  wait till pay day he prophesied after
his mirth had died away

  pidgin was determined to get acquainted

  how many men yu got in camp he
persisted

  about sixty

  an yure feedin sixty men b gosh
pidgin reflectively stroked his stubbly chin
must use a lot o grub

  he refilled garveys glass and waved a
deprecatory hand at the proffered nickel

  i spose went on the knowledge-seek-
ing saloon man th cumpny sends yu out
a lot o grub-moren yu need sometimes
mebbe

  garvey sipped his beer listened and was
silent encouraged by the cooks silence
pidgin continued

  i figger on havin a gang o woodchop-
pers in frum th woods purty soon awful
appetites them fellers any time yu got
more stockn yu need mebbe-

  garvey still tantalizingly held his peace

  -i could take a little offen yu pervided
yore price aint too steep finished pidgin
at last

  the cooks intellectual processes were not
slow and they grasped at once the signifi-
cance of the saloon mans proposal it was
in fact an invitation to garvey to do a little
grafting at the companys expense by
making his commissary requisitions a trifle
bigger and cutting down his table allow-
ances to the men a stock surplus could
readily be acquired that he could turn into
cash the cook being a blunt man prompt-
ly declared himself

  i aint a petty larceny guy he replied
shortly

  now yure hittin th wrong trail
pardner expostulated pidgin coloring
somewhat nevertheless i mean a it
deal on th level

  o scuse me grinned garvey but
it happens that i aint th boss-ixept in me
own kitchen i draw th grub frum th
comsry clerk an i give th gandys evry
pound that i draw whatever other failins

ive got by - they cant call me a

belly-robber

  the saloon-keeper dropped the subject
and the cook having finished drinking his
beer abruptly left the saloon and returned
to camp

crane-the commissary compa-
nys runner who had charge of
all the camps-came to drayton to
take stock

  your stuff checks all right he assured
bolton i understand youre a new man
sonny and im going to put you hep to a
few things

  the runner lit a cigaret and sprawled
with a comfortable air of proprietorship
upon boltons bunk

  youre in charge of the camp youll
issue to garvey whatever he calls for in the
line of grub dont butt directly into his
kitchen business-thats his end of the
game-unless he gets soused in that event
its up to you to see that the gang eats and
its your own business how you go about it
if garvey doesnt snap out of the booze at
once its your privilege to telegraph for
another cook youll find him an a number
one hasher but a mean customer to get
mixed up with in case he gets sore at you
in case he gets sore at me repeated the
clerk indignantly why he met me with
a grouch-first time i saw him

  bolton looked the runner squarely in the
eyes

  now crane he demanded why
should any man get sore at me even before
he knows me

  the runner exhaled a cloud of cigaret
smoke luxuriously through his nose gazed
reflectively at the glowing end of the little
cylinder and then a sophisticated smile
grew about the corners of his mouth

  sonny he replied with a patient shrug
the reason harks us back to the very foun-
dations of society-even before the stone
age-when certain gorillas began to wear
gee-strings and rings through their noses
in order to distinguish themselves from
other gorillas

  class you mean queried bolton un-
derstandingly why im not aware that
i put on any airs

  these hard-boiled old chaws went on
crane simply do not love a white-collar
guy

  what have  done to incur their ani-
mosity

  thats not the question if one of them


adventure

happens to drift into a city office where you
are employed if youre a stenographer
youll stop stenogging a minute or if youre
ledger-keeper youll stop ledgering a min-
ute until you take a pike at this birds
awkwardness and his funny clothes in
a strange environment and with numbers
against him he feels like a fish trying to
navigate dry land the chaw remembers
this and when you leave your typewriter
or your ledger and come out to his country-
a country of rocks and rough-house picks
and shovels hard fists and hard liquor-
he feels that you ought to pause and
flounder and back out of the picture
the same as he did when he was in your
country

  crane rose yawned and threw away the
butt of his cigaret

	why do they call these men gandy
dancers asked the clerk suddenly

  ive never been able to find out just
why some old-timers claim theres an
irish dance called the gandy that looks
about like the antics of two trackmen work-
ing as partners and tamping up a tie with
their feet on their shovels

  well whats a crum boss

  crane chuckled

  this camp lingos a puzzler eh why
the crum boss is the camp chore boy-
cleans out the cars makes up the mens
bunks and looks after the fires in cold
weather

  i think i understand the term now
replied the clerk with a grin isnt crum
a sort of slang allusion to an unmentionable
species of vermin that often propagates in
mens clothing and blankets if so in this
case i must say-

  you mean prompted thorunner laugh-
inly that in this case the term is appropri-
ate

  maybe hell improve on acquaintance
said bolton generously

  yes youve sure got a strange assort-
ment of humanity to deal with sonny
youve happened to strike about the tough-
est camp in the line if you can clean it up
and get it in working order-but i hadnt
better do so much gassing ive got to
catch my train youll plug your way
through all right because youve got the
get-there look in your eye you might need
a little strong-arm diplomacy but if ever
things get too raw just drop me an s o s
along the line ill pick it up somewhere

and run over to help you out goodby and
good luck

  as the days passed bolton endeavored to
arrive at a proper understanding of the big
cook although he found it hard to penetrate
the latters crust of grouchiness garvey
owned a strong vein of nervous energy that
throbbed unceasingly in him although this
energy found outlet for the most part in his
work garvey could cook that fact was
patent the gandy dancers simple ration
he manipulated as if by magic into victuals
that were little short of delicious the clerk
determined to do his utmost toward dwell-
ing in amity with garvey he felt- instinc-
tively however that there was a sleeping
devil in the man and the approaching pay-
day gave him additional grounds for uneasi-
ness inasmuch as the big cook was reputed
to be very ugly when drink possessed him

  pay-day muttered bolton while going
to bed on the evening before that eventful
day somehow that yrl hath an ominous
sound

th pay trains here

 slade the crum boss came
bounding into camp with the news
got mine he shouted gleefully th
gandys is gittin paid now

  slade waved a roll of bills exultantly in
the air and almost immediately disappeared
in the direction of the pidgin coop that
evening only half the gang sat down to
supper the others galvanized into ac-
tivity by the power that had come suddenly
into their overalls pockets had departed
without eating in quest of such excite-
ments as the mountain saloon was able to
offer

  jim pidgin was thunderstruck by the
sudden influx of moneyed patrons thirty
or forty gandy dancers formed a solid
phalanx of booze-fighting humanity in front
of his bar and commanded instant assuage-
ment of the thirst that consumed them
hey jack this is on me

  nix im buyin this roun take it
outa here bartenner

hey yu aint my kale no good
two boozes an two beers mac an
a coupla good seegars make it snappy
hey cant a guy buy a drink in dis
joint i aint had one fer de las five
minutes

the saloon-keeper began rushing dazedly
about in an effort to fill the complex office of
the commissary in the hills



change-making decanter-filling and glass-
rinsing the last of these he quickly dis-
pensed with as being the least necessary
he scented the gandys determination to
arrive at the state of drunkenness as speed-
ily as possible and it occurred to his thrifty
soul that dirty glasses would produce the
result quite as effectively as clean ones
likewise in the first of the mentioned func-
tions he soon began to be tardy and when-
ever one of the gandys who retained enough
wits to observe the shortage began to clamor
for his change pidgin would promptly
apologize and fall back upon the excuse that 
being alone he could not help occasionally
overlooking such trifles

  notwithstanding this simplification of his
labors however such a continuous torrent
of expostulation and exhortation surged
over the bar that pidgin was at last com-
pelled to impress one of his stable-hands
into auxiliary barservice bills of all de-
nominations held to their places by little
piles of silver change lay in scattered care-
lessness over the bar and the bumpkins
eyes and hands were so affected by the
sight that their clumsy ministrations served
to impede rather than to aid the headlong
rush of the gandy dancers into intoxication
although notwithstanding this handicap
they seemed to be nearing the desired goal
quickly enough

  in the midst of the uproar a man who
towered head and shoulders above the
throng elbowed his way determinedly
through the rear rank and began pounding
imperatively upon the bar with a huge fist
demanding instant recognition by virtue of
his size and station

  gimme a lit licker pidgin he rum-
bled with a surly grin didnt i give yu
th right dope about a gandy pay-day

  the harassed saloon-keeper set out a de-
canter and glass-scarcely however with-
drawing his fascinated eyes from the piles of
currency that lay pleading for expenditure
around him business phew during all
his experience-not even when the wood-
choppers came out of the woods-his little
hostelry had never suffered such an insistent
bombardment as this

  slade the crum boss-clinging to the bar
with both hands to keep himself from sliding
into the scuppers nevertheless blinked and
stared and nudged a gandy dancer with
whom he was drinking

  gryshe ju shee big bill hittin th red-

eye wnever bill starsh off like that heesh
gittin prim fer drunk

  that means said the crum bosss com-
panion-a hard-eyed ghoulish-faced fellow
who stood his drink well-that th wite-
collar stiff in th comsryll git his i un-
nerstan he made brags he was gonna clean
up th camp garveyll clean him up-hey

seeking to determine the ex-
tent of the cyclone-like devastatin
wrought by pay-day at an early
hour on the following morning bolton in-
spected camp garvey-a strange glitter
discernible in his steel-gray eyes-was
nevertheless on the job and getting the men
their breakfast further investigation
however disclosed the fact that preparing
breakfast for the gang was an almost need-
less accomplishment

  the gandy dancers bolton smiled at
what he saw in the bunk cars the break-
fast gong drew from them merely grunts of
indifference or ejaculations of disgust
about a dozen stumbled tardily to the mess
table and managed to swallow a flapjack or
two but the others-those who still had
money-went instead to the pidgin coop
slade the crum boss who had been absent
all night staggered into camp about nine
oclock and fell helpless across his bunk
his duties were being much neglected
bolton reluctantly realized that the time
for exerting his authority was at hand he
found slade in a drunken stupor and shook
him vigorously

  get up and sweep those cars and make
up the bunks he commanded

  the crum boss strangled a snore twisted
his neck lazily about on the pillow and
blinked resentfully upward

  whassat he grunted in a ludicrous
attempt at derision whassat yu shay
the clerk struggled with and conquered
an intense desire to laugh he caught slade
by the collar and yanked him out of the
bunk slade staggeringly adopted the
crouch of battle and the utmost seriousness
leaped from his bloodshot eyes

  do your work or get off the job
snapped bolton im not cheap enough to
hit a drunk

  thashall ri muttered the inebriate
wanna make a enmy outa me hey
thashall ri

  i must say i prefer your enmity to your
friendship said the clerk candidly
io

adventure

  he continued his cleaning-up operations
by breaking up a riotous bunk party of
gandy dancers

  these cars and bunks are to sleep in-
not to make hog-pens out of he said sharp-
ly if you want to get drunk again go
back to the saloon

  who th -- give yu all th torty
round here anyway demanded a hard-
faced drunkard named gryce wats
a wite-collar stiff like yu got on us guys
hey

  i dont quarrel gryce said the clerk
quietly

  haw haw haw guffawed gryce his
fellow rioters following suit

  but continued bolton without the
slightest trace of anger on his face walking
over and standing close to gryce and look-
ing directly into the gandy dancers eyes
that doesnt mean that i dont fight

  the gandy was considerably taken aback

  oh-theys a diffrunce is they he
parried

  i believe there is-quite a difference

  gryce did not like the lightning in the
clerks eyes he decided to refrain from
making the challenge that quivered on his
lips and shrugging his shoulders he
slouched away toward the pidgin coop

  well thats two enemies so far-with
garvey a probable third said the clerk to
himself ill get them fined up after a
while	 j

it was garveys turn to balk
work and whisky seldom harmon-
ize as was evident when his alco-
holic outburst assumed greater proportions
he took his flunkeys over to the mountain
saloon and all three returned to camp an
hour before supper time and flopped im-
mediately upon their bunks to enjoy a post-
bibulative snooze the kitchen fire was out
and not a sign of culinary activity was dis-
cernible in the cook-car soon the workers
would come marching grimly in from their
track toil and find naught but an empty
mess-table in lieu of the horn of plenty

  bolton was dismayed at the prospect but
he concealed his perturbation under the
mask of a resolute chin and determined
eyes one glance at the burly frame of gar-
vey lying in heavy marching order on
his bunk was sufficient to eliminate him
from the immediate scheme of cookery one
bare and brawny arm was twisted under his

thick neck and his long gray mustache
straggled up around his nostrils disclosing
a sleepy sneer on his lips the neck of a
liquor flask peeped from beneath the pillow

  a sleeping devil muttered bolton
backing cautiously away

  he found the two flunkeys in much the
same condition although one of them was
sufficiently conscious to muster up a curse
at the clerks scrutiny

  useless concluded the latter utterly
useless the staff is out of commission

  bolton fished an idea out of his sea of
difficulties and went down the track in
search of the foreman whom he found
attempting to badger some work out of his
sadly-depleted laboring force

  a cook eh he repeated in response to
the clerks query garvey soused agin
taint th fust time t my knowlidge wal
thars stuttrin sims-i dunno ef yu kin
git him t butt into garveys job though
garveys bout got em all bluffed but
sims usta be a hasher an th gangs sure
got t eat hey sims

  a mild-eyed young man threw down his
tamping shovel leisurely detached himself
from the little knot of gandy dancers and
sauntered up in obedience to the foremans
command bolton tersely explained his
predicament doubt meanwhile clouding
simss brow

  of c-c-c-c-c-c-c-course- he began

  never mind said the clerk sympa-
thetically noting the mans vocal impedi-
ment do the best you can ill help you

  sims reluctantly followed bolton back to
camp and the twain invaded garveys
culinary stronghold

  of c-c-c-c-c-c-c-course- began the

impromptu cook again

  he turned a faltering gaze upon bolton
a sonorous rasping noise could be dis-
tinctly heard emanating from the big mans
sleeping quarters

  ill take care of you sims promised the
clerk quietly suspecting the cause of his
hesitation

  sims somewhat dubiously surveyed bol-
tons physical proportions the clerk was
a well set-up young fellow but he was only
half as big as garvey and moreover the big
cook in action was reputed to be really
formidable just then one of the flunkeys
stumbled into view brushing the booze-mist
out of his eyes and looking half-contemptu-
ously at the clerk
the commissary in the hills



  get on the job

 the sudden and unexpected command
held a whip-like note the flunkey blinked
stared a moment into the clerks stern eyes
flashed an instinctively appealing glance in
the direction of garveys sleeping quarters
and then flnding boltons gaze still fastened
upon him he swallowed a half-uttered retort
and began to make some show of attending
to his duties

  that piece of psychology decided sims
presently there was a great rattle of pots
and pans in the gandy dancers kitchen
bolton built a fire in the stove the fast-
sobering flunkey began to set the tables it
soon began to be evident that the hungry
trackmen would have some supper

  suddenly the sleeping devil awoke the
unmistakable din of culinary affairs had
penetrated to his submerged consciousness
he staggered to his feet passed a broad
hand over his feverish brow and then scent-
ing the trespass that had taken place he
strode to the kitchen doorway bolton and
sims saw the devil at the same moment it
was as though every human lineament had
been suddenly erased from the countenance
of a big broad-shouldered man and brute
eyes brute lips and brute teeth painted in
instead reason had gone out and insen-
sate rage had entered in garveys fore-
head seemed somehow to have acquired a
gorilla-like slant he was brutal beastly-
a human being temporarily stripped of his
rank by the force of his own passions

  sims shrank backward bolton was very
pale but he stepped resolutely in front of
sims and faced garvey

  git out o my kitchen

  it was more like a bulls bellow than a
mans voice the devil did not wait for
obedience to his furious command he
rushed blindly toward bolton and sims
seeking to engulf both men at the same
instant that reckless maneuver proved
the key to his downfall the cool sober
mind of bolton was illumined by a light-
ning-like flash of confidence this drunken
two hundred weight of flesh falling unsteadi-
ly toward him inspired by an excess of
alcoholic confidence-why-

  crack

  the clerk had refused to become excited
instead he had given his body a quarter of
a revolution and put all his driving force
behind his lean right arm the said arm
had sped skilfully upward between garveys

circling appendages and the crack was the
signal of impact between boltons hard-
driven right fist and garveys exposed
chin

  go ahead with the supper sims

  sims stood open-mouthed looking first
at the clerk and then at garvey the big
cook seemed to have fallen to the lowest
depths of bewilderment while reason
seeped slowly back into his brain he tried
vainly to solve the riddle of his sudden fall
instead of clerk and rival cook fleeing before
his mad wrath as in days gone by when
trespass upon his domain had provoked him
to similar action-what did he see bolton
calmly directing sims to go ahead with the
cookery as if nothing in the least exciting
had occurred-paying not even the slightest
attention to him he-bill garvey-the
dean of the fighting cooks-the culinary
autocrat of the whole line-lying on the
floor-knocked cold by a clerk

  garvey got again upon his feet but
smothered the roar of defiance that rose to
his lips and contented himself with glaring
at the proceedings sims calmly slid a pan
of new-made hash into the oven and the
clerk deliberately turned his back upon
garvey and began stoking the fire the
frightened flunkey fast returning to sobri-
ety took his instructions from bolton
garvey thrice opened his mouth in an
effort toward invective but the strong pro-
fanity that boiled within him somehow
could not come out the complete usurpa-
tion of all his prerogatives had stricken him
speechless

  send fer me relief he rumbled at last
after his emotions had found voice

  there was a queer look in the big mans
eyes as he turned about and shambled un-
steadily back to his bunk he thrust his
huge frame viciously under the blankets-
shoes clothing and all-yanked the whisky
bottle from beneath his pillow flipped out
the cork with his thumb-nail gulped half
a pint of the strong liquor at a draught and
then-staring straight ahead a moment with
bloodshot eyes before oblivion claimed
him-he muttered--

  bill garveys a-goint git even

slade we gotta gyp this tee-
totlin wite-collar stiff somehow
make him emigrate hey th
outfit aint a home fer a rummy no more
how yu gonna do it gryce th guys
adventure

got evrybody guessin atter th way he
handled garvey

  aw nix on th movie stuff-i mean git
him git him right went on gryce ven-
omously

  jim pidgin served the crum boss and his
companion with more liquor a cunning
whisky-born scheme had begun to grow in
gryces evil brain it was two days after
pay-day but he and slade were still drink-
ing although the rest of the gandy dancers
were broke after their fierce jamboree and
had gone back to the track to their labor

  some had spent their money others had
fallen victims to pidgins short-changing
while they were drunk still others had
fallen prey to camp plunderers who had
picked their pockets while they slept
slade and gryce for some reason still had
money they stood alone in the barroom
of the pidgin coop and pidgins avaricious
fingers closed fast over the dimes that they
put forth in exchange for his cheap liquor
honest money or otherwise-it all clinked
the same in the ears of jim pidgin

  gryces voice had dropped to a whisper
and he was talking earnestly to the crum
boss

  sounds purty raw gryce objected
slade uneasily i gotta think it over
raw sneered gryce its th neates
way o gittin back at him aint it hes
signed up fer th junk an hes responsible
fer it th cumpnyll jist nachully think he
peddled it hisself because theys lots o
these comsry stiffs that peddles their own
outfits an then beats it-dont yu know
that

  at this point pidgin thrust himself into
the conversation and turned gryces liquory
eloquence into a new channel

  so th big feller got licked eh he in-
quired curiously leaning familiarly over the
bar how come

  stewed replied gryce th kid past-
ed bill when bill wasnt expectin it if
bill garveyd been half-sober hed have
picked that teetotlin kid up by th ears an
spit in his eye an drownded him-eh
slade bill aint troo wit him yet any-
way bill garvey dont never fergit

  did yore noo cook come yit

 hit camp at noon looks like a
rummy

  bring im over grinned pidgin

  when the two men returned to camp their
red faces and unsteady gait told the secret

of their absence bolton had something to
say to them and he said it without pre-
amble

  gryce you havent worked for three
days if you dont start in youll have to
leave camp were boarding working men
-not loafers

  aw how d yu git that way snarled
the gandy dancer im payin me board
same as anybody else aint i yu aint
got no torty t fire a guy either

  i cant fire you but i can close up your
board account

  gryce choked back a curse and started
for the dining-car

  slade continued the clerk sternly
ive already warned you about neglecting
your work if you dont snap out of it ill
put a man in your place

  the crum boss avoided boltons eyes
and followed gryce

  now what d yu say demanded the
latter in a savage whisper are yu game
t clip this birds wings afore he gits yu or
not

  we gotta have help parried the crum
boss uncertainly us two blokes aint nuff
t pull th stunt off

  ill fix that yu boob ill git a fine on
this new hasher he stacks up like a rummy
an he looks queer he wont git along wit
this teetotlin wite-collar stiff nohow ill
steer him over t th coop an put a coupla
charges under his belt thatll loosen him
up these hashers is lookin fer graft same
as anybody else

  meanwhile garvey had gone to the city to
report to headquarters for a settlement of
his account and for assignment to another
camp his exceptional cookery covered
a multitude of personal shortcomings the
man whom the company had sent to dray-
ton to succeed him was a ferret-eyed person
named joe beehan whose predilection for
more than one half of one per cent refresh-
ment was amply attested to by the red vari-
cose veins that branched from his proboscis
to his cheek bones bolton felt an instant
dislike of beehan there was something
snaky about the fellow that inspired dis-
trust he slapped the clerk familiarly on
the back

  yull find me a good ieller t git along
wit bolton he said reassuringly i
aint like th other feller-garvey

  the new cook offered to share with bol-
ton a pint of liquor that he had brought
the commissary in the hills

along in his suit case but the clerk declined
the proffered pledge of friendship

  i dont drink on the job he said
shortly

  beehan drank alone and then proceeded
to raise a portentous clatter of pots and pans
in the kitchen all his noisy application
however when judged by the concrete
culinary result appeared to signify little
the gandy dancers grumbled loudly at the
first meal he set before them their appe-
tites had returned three-fold after the effects
of their recent debauch had worn away
but alas their palates educated to a
high degree of exaction under the garvey
regime were suddenly confronted with the
clumsy food-mangling ministrations of
beehan

  good lord murmured bolton in dis-
may when he looked over the sorry mess
that the new cook called a meal the
gangll lynch him if he keeps up that gait

three tall bottles stood on a
shelf in the cook-car they con-
tained respectively lemon extract
vanilla extract and egg coloring the three
strong alcoholic infusions that form the
flavoring basis of the simple art of camp
cookery the clerk had issued them to
garvey only a couple of days prior to his
departure garvey had not had occasion
to use much of the extract but now-

  great guns exclaimed bolton to him-
self what can the fellow be doing with all
that extract why the quart of lemon is
already half gone

  sims afforded the desired enlightenment
because that evening when he entered the
commissary to buy tobacco the clerk en-
quired-

  sims did you use any of that lemon
extract

  the gandy dancer shook his head in
prompt negative then noticing boltons
puzzled demeanor and realizing the new
clerks greenness about certain matters that
appertained to a gandy dancers camp he
suggested mildly-

  of c-c-c-c-c-c-c-course theres some c-c-
c-c-c-c-cooks that d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-

  the clerk took a short cut to knowledge
at the same time helping sims out of his
articulative flounderings

  what you dont mean they drink it
he demanded in astonishment

  sims nod and accompanying grin solved

the enigma bolton surmised at once that
beehan who was probably broke and get-
ting over the effects of a city spree after
having drunk his pint of whisky had re-
sorted to the extract to soothe his jumping
nerves on the following morning his
suppositions were crystallized into certain-
ties by the pronounced lemon-aura that
invested beehans person the cooks eyes
were dull the varicose web-work about his
nose was fiery red he moved about like
a man under the influence of a drug bolton
remarked that the ravaged bottle had been
refilled with a pale liquid during a minute
of beehans absence he tasted it and found
as he had conjectured that it was only
water he noticed also that the bottle of
vanilla likewise had been attacked

   the fool will kill himself if he tackles
 that egg coloring thought bolton what
 the deuce shall i do

   the gandy dancers were already roaring
for a new cook because it had become evi-
dent to the most feeble comprehension that
the extract-guzzling food-mutilating bee-
han could not be tolerated long in his pres-
ent capacity the potatoes that he dished
out to appease the gaunt gandys were
usually half-cooked his bread was either
close to the status of dough or scorched to
a semblance of charcoal his beans were
simply indigestible his java suffered
much by comparison with ooze from the
bottom of the fabled styx how they
missed the master hand of garvey

  beehan suddenly stopped drinking the
extract which afforded relief to bolton
at the peak of his disgust however the
clerk had written to headquarters as fol-
lows

                          drayton pa aug 
 metropolitan commissary company

      new york

 gentlemen

   please ship at once one dozen quarts of extracts
 assorted for beverage purposes also please state
 maximum daily ration of same allowable to one
 cook

respectfully

j bolton

   the clerk had not wished to write a formal
 denunciation of beehan but trusted to the
 managers acumen to decipher between the
 lines the true condition of affairs at the
 drayton camp now while beehan no
 longer drank extract he nevertheless re-
 mained as alcoholic and as incapable of
 culinary duty as before added to this


adventure

bolton was especially uneasy over the heavy
issues of supplies that beehan required he
drew at least one-third more of all staple
commodities than garvey and yet the re-
sultant victuals that reached the gandy
dancers table and evoked their condemna-
tion were easily one-third less	
stuttering sims once again fished bolton
out of the sea of ignorance

  how is it humanly possible to waste so
much good food sims queried the clerk
in the last stage of exasperation and
how can a cook keep drunk without money
or extract

  of c-c-c-c-c-c-c-course began the gan-
dy dancer deprecatingly using the expres-
sion as a thought-balancer before beginning
his onerous task of delivering an idea i

aint a stool-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-

  bolton shot a keen look into sims mild
and innocent eyes

  -igeon ground out the stutterer at
last

  he paused looking significantly at the
clerk

  bolton drumming reflectively on the
edge of his desk with nervous fingers
finally pushed a box of cigars toward sims
selected and lighted a weed himself locked
up his commissary and walked up into the
hills at the top of a rocky escarpment that
rose on one side of the pathway to the pidgin
coop he secreted himself dusk was falling
swiftly over the landscape but before it had
completely rubbed out the visibility of
things beneath the clerk descried some
distant figures coming along the pathway
three he finally counted each of them
seemed to be carrying a bundle as they
passed by boltons hiding place fifty feet
below a sudden blasphemous outburst
punctured the evening stillness

  slade-i thought so muttered the
clerk to himself

 gryce he supplemented a moment
later when another voice arose in angry
criticism of the crum boss outcry gryce
was evidently the brains of the villainy
bolton was already aware of the evil
influence the gandy dancer exercised over
the weak-kneed crum boss and the third
member of the party why beehan the
cook of course the reason why he had
stopped drinking the extract was now quite
clear with sixty men to feed and drawing
ajdaily ration that was competent under
good handling to feed eighty he had never-

theless been providing food that was scarce-
ly sufficient for the needs of forty under
this system he was thus enabled to peddle
half his entire drawings

  no wonder he can buy booze ex-
claimed bolton grimly id like to know
how he happened to get in with that rotten
bunch so soon well ive got to clean this
gang out somehow

  sitting in the sweet mountain air and
looking perplexedly a t the lights of the little
camp below the harassed young clerk
thought out his problem nearly three-
score honest working-men being consistent-
ly robbed of their subsistence by a miserable
drunken sneak posing as a cook two petty
scoundrels and a conniving saloon-keeper
faugh the clerk acquired a sudden respect
for garvey

  cranes instructions to bolton required
the latter to issue to the cook whatever
commodities were called for this string
to his authority was instrumental in bring-
ing him to an immediate decision upon the
matter that confronted him

   ill send an s o s to crane he con-
cluded this is more than a one-man job

   the nearest telegraph office was at hill-
crest a town ten miles north it was
eight oclock and he could get a train at
eight-thirty bolton returned immediately
to the camp and sought sims

  ive got to go to hillcrest sims he
announced to the gandy dancer may not
be able to get back before morning id feel
easier if youd sleep in the commissary car
theres over a thousand dollars worth of
stuff in there youre a man im not afraid
to trust

  of c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-course began sims
in a hesitating way

  thanks returned bolton with a smile
handing him the key the door is pad-
locked on the outside theres no inside
lock but you wont need one because youll
be inside yourself

   sims heaved a reluctant sigh and took the
key his unfortunate impediment was
bringing him unwished-for responsibilities

   the clerk was not called upon to flag the
train it stopped at drayton to discharge
one passenger-a big-boned rough-looking
man who wore knee boots

 wharbouts is jim pidgins he asked
bolton

  the clerk paused long enough on the car
steps to direct him before the train pulled
the commissary in the hills	

out the stranger stumbled over the un-
familiar road through the darkness in the
direction of the glimmer of light that came
from the pidgin coop

  jist got in boys feller git tin on th train
with a wite choker on tol me whar t come
the newcomer shook hands with a couple
of woodchoppers and ordered whisky
the incident of having been directed on his
way by a white-collar man had lingered in
his memory-white collars being largely
anomalous to the back woods and therefore
memorable the woodchopper referred
again to the incident amid some good-
natured curses and the clinking of glasses
pidgin was doing business half a dozen
woodsmen were drinking at one end of the
bar and gryce slade and beehan stood
slopping at the other gryce having over-
heard the strangers remarks pricked up his
ears he nudged both slade and beehan

  did yu hear that youse guys he whis-
pered theys only one bloke that sports
a wite choker in these jungles an thats th
comsry clerk he musta gone t town
they aint no train back afore mornin
nows our chance t pull th trick-hey
the trio of food thieves exchanged
glances gryce ordered more whisky he
took pidgin aside and talked to him in an
undertone

  looks purty raw objected the saloon-
keeper i aint aimin on gittin quainted
wit th perlice

  bah yure buyin th stuff from th
cook hisself aint yu that lets yu out
drink up jim bawled one of the pro-
prietors cronies  nuther one a-comin
pidgin reached over lifted his newly
filled glass of liquor from the bar and tossed
it off the fire of avarice began to burn
still more brightly in his eyes

  ill come down an look it over he
promised gryce at last

      four oclock in the morning
      brought a sharp knock on the gang
      foremans car door

  wreck he grumbled jumping hastily
out of his bunk and opening the door to
admit the knocker

  the commissary car is stolen
suffrin cats was the boss astonished
exclamation how come clerk

  theres been thieving going on for some
time beehan seems to be in with gryce
and slade his drawings have been excep-

tionally heavy i saw them carrying bun-
dles last night in the direction of the pidgin
coop i took the eight-thirty to hillcrest
to wire tocrane got back at three this
morning and the whole carwas gone sims
was to sleep in the car till i returned no
trace of sims gryce slade or beehan in
their bunks i got a lantern from the cook-
car and went down the track the derail
is off the switch thrown on to the spur
i picked up two pinch bars at the cross road
below the bend on the main line marks of
a wagons wheels and horses hooves in the
soft earth by the side of the road some
flour and rice on the ground-leaked out of
the bags probably

  the foreman lighted the lamp in his car
and turned a serious face to bolton

  yu sure got trouble aint yu clerk
he sympathized wal ive heerd that
feller pidgins a tough character usta be
a woodchopper afore he went in fer easy
money stands in wit th woods bunch
its a bad part o th state up here some
of em git away wit murder that gryce
is a bad egg too there was a cuttin in
a camp two year ago that he was mixed up
in but they didnt have enough evidence
agin him an he got away wit it sims
knowed that because sims was workin in
th same camp at th time sims is afeerd
o that feller i dont know much about th
noo hasher but--

  here the grizzled old foremans eyes
flashed with indignation

  -ef hes anythin like his grub hes sure
rotten

  how did they get the tools

  th crum boss carries th key t th tool
box its part o his job t git th tools out
fer th gang evry mornin an lock em up
evry night th switch key an derail key
was hangin inside th box he knowed
that what puzzles me is what become o
th car reckon they wouldnt have been
crazy enough t turn it loose-it must have
got away frum em on th grade

  the foreman had meanwhile pulled on
his overalls and shoes

  ill run over t hillcrest in th speeder
an notify th operator he decided th
operator kin wire along th line want me
t notify th perlice

  theres a detachment of constabulary
at hillcrest isnt there inquired bolton
maybe youd better notify them because
its bound to be a police job
adventure

  five minutes later the swift gasoline
speeder was flying northward

     ha ha ha the young fellow
 at drayton has got a sense of hu-
mor eh danged if he hasnt
orders a dozen quarts of extracts for bever-
age purposes-asks for maximum daily
ration allowable to one cook pretty good
well-this is beehans last chance with us
theres been the same complaint about
him in every camp weve sent him to

  the manager of the metropolitan com-
missary company swung briskly about in
his swivel chair and roared-

  any cooks out there

  without waiting for a response he jumped
up and opened the door leading to the ante-
room where cooks and flunkeys were accus-
tomed to congregate while awaiting assign-
ment at that moment the room held only
one occupant-a big broad-shouldered man
with an iron-gray mustache who sat idly
twisting the same between his thick fingers

 why garvey what in - is the

matter

  nuthins th matter-that i know of
rumbled big bill fixing his steel-gray eyes in
furtive interrogation upon those of his em-
ployer

  the manager still stared

  bill how long have you cooked for us
  goin on ten years

  bill its the first time you ever came in
without getting drunk are you sick bill-
or broke-or what you surely cant be
broke-we only paid you off day before
yesterday

  i aint sick an i aint broke-im lookin
fer a job

  ive only got one job this morning-
drayton

  thats jist where i wanta go

  why garvey you just came from
there

  an i wanta go back

  for some seconds the manager continued
looking keenly into the rugged face of his
old cook

  bill-whats on your mind he de-
manded suspiciously at last

  nuthin-ixept that i wanta go back t
me old job at drayton persisted garvey
doggedly

  well well wonders will never cease
bill garvey in new york-cold sober-
wants to go back on the job again without

even getting drunk however theres no
hurry for a day or so bill i expect crane
in tomorrow or next day you can go back
with him tomorrow night or next night on
number three but-

 what

  dont get drunk

  i aint drinkin growled garvey surlily
with a peculiar gleam in his steel-gray eyes

f  we want a squar meal-an we
     dont work till we git it

        after a meager breakfast con-
cocted of scraps that the flunkeys had col-
lected from the cook-carthe men had adopt-
ed the foregoing slogan they shouted it
harshly at the assistant foreman when he
blew his whistle summoning them forth to
their days labor he resorted to argu-
ment but the gang had consolidated into
a unit upon that question and they flatly
refused to lift a pick or a shovel until their
grievance had been adjusted one glance
around the circle of set faces convinced
the straw boss that the men were in ear-
nest the gandys had organized knowing
something of herd nature the straw wisely
dropped his attempts at coercion and de-
cided to await the foremans return

  i dont see what youse guys has got agin
th railroad though he grumbled as he
turned away  taint th railroads fault
th railroad aint feedin yu here comes
th guy now whats responsible fer yur
chuck why dont yu fight it out wit
him

  the young clerks eyes were ringed with
lines of sleeplessness and fatigue in the
middle of the night he had walked back
from hillcrest the rest of the night he had
spent in a vain search for his stolen com-
missary and then when dawn had come-
having at heart his duty to the men-he had
resolutely jumped in and helped the
flunkeys find something for their breakfast
nevertheless the fifty-six striking gandy
dancers eyed him coldly and suspiciously
when he approached fifty-six to one
those were surely safe enough odds for
bullying even though the clerk was reported
to have licked garvey-when he was drunk

  hey yu wite-collar stiff wen are we
gonna eat

  the clerk turned about and looked at
them-fifty-six husky sneering tarriers
hostile in eye and attitude cluttering the
steps and doorways of their bunk-cars
the commissary in the hills

cranes words struck him very significantly
at the moment-

  these hard-boiled old chaws simply do
not love a white-collar guy -

  bolton-his open young mind quick to
sense the unreasonable hostility-decided
to appeal to the fairness of their natures

  boys he began frankly im going to
see that you get a real good dinner if youll
only give me a little more time to straighten

out this unfortunate matter- 

  a sudden outburst of hoots and cat-calls
drowned the closing words of his explanation

  aw more bull croaked an old shovel
stiff with a beak like a poll-parrots and a
voice like a bullfrogs we aint put our
teet troo nuttin sence- big bill garvey
wentaway

  waddidju chase big bill fer-hey be-
cause he dont wear no wite collar

  the gandys began edging cautiously in
boltons direction each measuring his ad-
vance to accord carefully with that of the
others

  yah yah th only hasher we ever had
yu chased him offen th job-hey-be-
cause he took a coupla shots th same as th
rest of us wy yu teetotlin stiff were
d yu tink yare-in sunny school

  a roar of mirth and mutual encourage-
ment rose from the throats of all the gandys
the clerk-both indignation and surprize
written on his features-stood his ground
he could scarcely realize that these men
could be so utterly stupid as to fail to un-
derstand that he was trying to clean up the
camp for their own good 

  why your own cronies-the very fel-
lows you worked with-are probably the
ones that robbed you of the grub dont
you know that he exclaimed hotly his sur-
prize changing to disgust

  - i bleeve he peddled th comsry

hisself-hey fellers thats alius th way
wit these teetotlin geezers djever see
one that wuzunt crooked

  this from a gandy with a ruby-colored
nose who shook his fist at bolton

  we awta lynch yu yu wite-collar
stiff

  the gandys in a sudden wave of collec-
tive bravery completely surrounded bolton
in order to rob him of the opportunity to
look them all in the eyes at the same time
across the clerks pale face swept a sudden
flare of anger he pulled off his coat and
threw it upon the ground

   now he shouted scornfully if youll

come one at a time-like white men-

   his defiant gaze swept the encircling mob
of strikers with fists clenched and chest
heaving with excitement he stood ready for
action against any odds

  dog-gone breathed the straw boss
admiringly ef that kid aint guts clean
frum his scalp-lock t his toe-nails rais-
ing his voice to a sudden shout he con-
tinued--

  ef one o yu beezoes lays a finger on

that feller ill clean out yur hull-gang

   the straw dived frantically into his car to
get his revolver when he reappeared a
minute afterward weapon in hand he
stopped on the car steps and stared in
amazement the tense expression on his
face relaxed slowly into a wide grin the
entire crowd of gandys could be seen rush-
ing pell-mell down the track toward the
north where about a mile distant a single
maroon-colored coach stood coupled to an
engine the soft purr of the locomotives
exhaust came distinctly along on the still
morning air the straw boss cramming a
huge chew of tobacco into his mouth put
away his revolver and rushed after the men

   the clerk was standing stock still where
they had left him-his fists still clenched
awaiting their onslaught and a sudden relief
and wonder swimming in his eyes pres-
ently he put on his coat shrugged his
shoulders and walked resolutely away in the
direction of the pidgin coop

   and those are the fellows he muttered
to himself that i am trying to give a
square deal to i really wonder if its
worth while

   scarcely had bolton arrived at the saloon
when the little morning local-over an hour
late-pulled into the drayton flag station
and discharged three passengers

why bill the camp is deserted ex-
claimed one of them i dont see a soul
look up there-at the junction was
a big broad-shouldered mans significant
reply what do yu see crane

  why its the pay car -sure enough
replied crane with an understanding grin
more money for the saloon-keeper

  i dunno objected garvey uncertainly
what d yu think simsy continued
the big man with a strange glint in his steel-
gray eyes

  of c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-course-

  crane laughed looking quizzically at
i

adventure

sims whose face was badly scratched and
swollen

  wed better go right over to the saloon
boys said the runner in a graver tone
bolton isnt here we may find him there

       after the three food-thieves had
left the pidgin coop bar on the
preceding night they stumbled back
over the rocky trail to the camp of the
gandy dancers which they found in dark-
ness it was ten oclock the clerk had
gone to hillcrest and the sky was overcast
the tired working-men had long since
sought repose and no one was stirring about

  slade said gryce authoritatively yu
carry th key t th tool box hey git out
a coupla pinch bars an th switch key an
th derail key easy now we dont
wanta advertise this lil buglary

  gimme a shot o that booze pleaded
the crum boss

  me too chimed in beehan

  gryce snorted disdainfully

  gotta have more booze t work up yur
nerve hey nice pair o blokes

  he produced a pint bottle however and
all drank the cook and the crum boss
seemed reluctant to undertake the job in
hand but over their weaker natures the
sneering philosophy of gryce at last gained
sway

  if yu dont git him hell git youse
guys was the pith of the gandy dancers
argument hes lookin t can yu slade
first chanst he gits-yu know it an i
know it hes after yur scalp too beean
no guy kin spoil all th hash yu do an git
by wit it th gandys is howlin fierce
about yur chuck hes probly gone t
wire fer a noo cook anyway he aint no
dummy even if he is a stiff hes wise t
yu drinkin up all th extrack too

  gryce passed the bottle around once
more and the resultant bravado that welled
up in the breasts of the two delinquents
made further argument unnecessary the
thieves thereupon reconnoitered the com-
missary car no lamplight shone through
its tiny windows on the door a small
square of white was discernible gryce
struck a match and peered closely at it

  its a note he grunted pinned on t
th door back in th mornin bolton it
says git yur tools slade its a long time
till mornin

  slade presently brought forth two pinch

bars the key to the switch and the key of
the derail the commissary car was the
first of the string lying nearest the switch
beehan and slade pried the wheels back-
ward with their bars releasing the strain
on the coupling-pin which enabled gryce
to uncouple the car the bars were then
reversed and the men began to pinch the
car gradually away from the string in the
direction of the switch that connected the
spur with the main line the car lying next
to the commissary was the cook-car and
beyond that lay the dining-car the sleep-
ing-cars of the gandy dancers the foreman
and the assistant foreman were at the far-
ther end of the string and there was little
chance of any of the sleepers being awak-
ened by the slight noise

  the spur ran slightly down grade to the
main line and the main line itself for a dis-
tance of twenty miles south ran down a two
per cent grade

  gryce climbed the ladder to the roof of
the car and stood by the brake wheel the
crum boss ran ahead unlocked the derail
and threw it off and then proceeded to the
switch which he also unlocked and turned
in such manner as to permit the passage of
the car to the main track

  the car moved slowly down grade passed
over the switch gained the main line and
at last arrived at a cross-road that ran
through the woods to the pidgin coop
gryce applied the brake swearing profusely
because the mechanism was rusty on
account of non-usage and therefore hard to
manipulate

  trow yur bar under th wheel slade
he shouted anxiously

  the crum boss obeyed orders and the car
jolted and came to a stop gryce descended
quickly

  now youse guys we gotta work fast
he commanded les have that bar
slade th carll stand we gotta break

th lock on th door -whats this he

exclaimed a moment later why th poor
simp fergot t lock th door kin yu beat
it why this aint buglary t all jist
helpin yurself

  gryce walked into the car followed by the
cook and crum boss he struck a match and
looked around boltons bunk bore evi-
dences of having been slept in but was
empty on the desk stood a lamp that
gryce lighted turning the wick down low
the commissary supplies were ranged about
the commissary in the hills



the floor and on the shelves in an orderly
manner and the thieves eyes were bright
with anticipation as they surveyed the ex-
tent of the loot

  they aint no train nort afore mornin
mused gryce reflectively an were on th
nortbound track but we got a tough
job pinchin th car back up grade-so les
go to it fast

  the men worked quietly save for an oc-
casional curse as they tussled with a heavy
box or bag within half- an hour the most
valuable of the supplies had been trans-
ferred to the ground the stolen articles
included provisions clothing shoes and
tobacco

  aint there anythin more in that bot-
tle whined beehan at length

  yull git a drink-when bizness is over
growled gryce heres pidgin cornin
now

  a moment afterward the saloon-keeper
arrived with a team and wagon he took
a lantern from beneath the seat and clam-
bered to the ground

  put th stuff in quick he directed anx-
iously we kin talk bizness up at th
coop fellers yur a-goin t run th car
back haint yu yu cant leave it on th
main line-thard be-t pay

  sure well run it back said gryce re-
assuringly soons we settle up there aint
no train doo anyway

  the four men hastily loaded the goods
in pidgins wagon and the saloon-keeper
whipped up his horses soon the greater
part of boltons commissary in alien hands
with the three thirsty thieves tagging along
behind the wagon had disappeared in the
darkness

 stuttering sims crawled from
beneath boltons bunk and grate-
 fully stretched his cramped legs
the stutterer was badly frightened first
he looked cautiously out of the door in the
direction the looters had gone then he
turned an apprehensive gaze upon the well-
nigh empty car it was a desolate-looking
commissary that met his view instead of
the neat and plentiful array of articles that
the clerk had confided to his care there re-
mained nothing now but a few bags of
turnips and potatoes and some miscellane-
ous articles of little value

  sims had long since abandoned the habit
of cursing which in his case consumed too

much time and energy unconsciously he
had become somewhat of a philosopher
now therefore instead of indulging in
recriminations he strove to conquer his
fears and to think his first move was to
leave the car and secrete himself in the
roadside shadows pending further develop-
ments

  an hour passed an indistinct murmur-
ing of voices then reached his ears through
the nocturnal stillness the thieves were
evidently returning presently sims could
hear their footsteps scruffing along the
rocky road so close did they pass to the
hidden watcher that he could see even in
the darkness that two of the men were
staggering gryces sneering tones snapped
out

  th tight-wad only two hunnerd iron
men fer a tousand wort o swag an a
quart o his blasted scat trown in well
les go in an have a drink-then well split
th dough

  sims crept stealthily out of the shadows
and peered through the open car doorway
the lamp was still burning as gryce had
originally left it and by its glow sims saw
the gandy dancer put a roll of bills upon the
table and pull the cork from a quart bottle
of liquor both cook and crum boss ap-
peared to be half-drunk beehan clutched
the newly opened bottle swung it avidly to
his lips and swilled a gill of it at a pull

  the absconding cooks face was the color
of a beet and his eyes blinked owlishly
still clasping the liquor bottle and pressing
it almost to his bosom as though fearful of
its escape he squatted unsteadily down
upon boltons bunk with a long sigh that
seemed to terminate his immediate activity
the crum boss glared angrily at him sud-
denly with a snarl slade reached over and
yanked the bottle from the cooks hands

  wanta go t sleep wit it been he de-
manded with appropriate sarcasm theys
other guys drinkin too aint they

  the crum boss accordingly allowed a gill
or two of the strong whisky to gurgle down
his own throat the almost immediate result
of which was that he who had not a whit
more backbone than the cook was likewise
speedily reduced to a state of imbecility

  gryce did not drink there was that in
his eyes that could easily be read by a sober
mind comprehension of his dastardly
scheme came to the stutterer in a sudden
flash the unscrupulous gandy dancer was


adventure

making his accomplices drunk with the end
in view of appropriating the entire proceeds
of the crime to himself he would steal
their share of the money and decamp leav-
ing them drunk and helpless against dis-
covery in the very car that they had looted
and the car was standing at the moment
exposed to traffic on the main line

  having progressed thus far in its reason-
ing sims brain grasped its duty and its
opportunity at the same instant his fin-
gers slid into his overalls pocket and drew
forth the key that bolton had entrusted to
his unworthy care then suddenly spring-
ing forward the stutterer slammed the door
shut and locked it almost instantly came
a hail of insane cursings from within ac-
companied by heavy poundings on the
locked door sims having atoned in slight
measure for his delinquent guardianship
gave vent to his feelings by a half-hysterical
laugh of happiness and relief the three
thieves were locked in the car they had
robbed and the key was in his pocket the
windows were only a foot square-too tiny
to permit escape the lock the car door
and the framework were stout

  the stutterer had already started toward
camp with the intention of arousing the
gang when the crash of glass made him
hesitate then he heard a scraping sound
at one of the windows rushing back to the
car he observed gryce whose features
were readily discernible by the lamplight
within whittling industriously away at one
of the window frames with a clasp knife
thinking no doubt to enlarge the aperture
sufficiently to permit of escape

  ill give yu fifty t git outa here he
yelled hoarsely when he saw the stutterers
shadow

  sims made no reply he paced back and
forth beside the car-on guard

  a hunnerd shouted gryce in a frenzy

  the stutterer could not have given his
thoughts speech even if he would the ex-
citement of events had taken his slight
vocal faculty completely from him

  hunnerd an fifty howled the impris-
oned man made desperate at length by his
captors indifference

  two hunnerd-all i got he shrieked at
last pledging the three rogues entire capital
to liquidate his importunities

  blast yu yu stuttrin - yelled

the furious gandy dancer in tardy identifi-
cation of his silent captor

  he proceeded to threaten sims with all
manner of physical torture of which the
most mild and least offensive form was
cutting his heart out finally when
neither his bribes nor his threats had sufficed
to elicit even one stuttered syllable from the
silent man on guard gryce fell to work
again with his knife in an effort to enlarge
the window opening sims picked up a
piece of ballast from the road bed and cast
it neatly through the aperture striking
gryce upon the mouth

 b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-belly-robber he ex-
ploded scornfully at last-the most oppro-
brious epithet at his command

  vile oaths in recognition of simss true
aim popped out of gryces mouth like a
string of firecrackers the trapped man
to render his face less conspicuous there-
upon extinguished the light an irregular
cadence that jarred upon his ear like the
strings of a viol discordantly jangled told
the watcher that gryces partners in crime
had guzzled their way into oblivion they
were utterly drunk and consequently per-
fectly safe

  the indefatigable rascality of gryce how-
ever held the stutterer to his guard sims
was reluctant to go to camp in search of
assistance for fear the master crook of the
little band by some means should escape
the shame of his dereliction had stiffened
into a determination that there should be no
second lapse of duty on his part he re-
solved to remain beside the jail car until
bolton returned or until someone else in
authority accidentally discovered him

  about three oclock in the morning a
strong uneasiness took hold of sims while
the first passenger train on the northbound
track would be number three-due in
drayton about six oclock-nevertheless
there was always a chance that a drag of
coal empties would come lumbering up the
valley and surprize him sims determined
to be prepared for this contingency he
went into the neighboring woods to gather
brush and twigs for a signal-fire in case he
should hear the rumble of an approaching
freight

  scarcely had he begun to collect these
materials however when a series of loud
crashes against the car door brought him
back to his post on the run gryce had
finally become desperate his unsubmissive
nature was charged with fury over the
thought of arrest-especially when effected
the commissary in the hills



 through such contemptible instrumentality
 as that of stuttrin sims the caged
 gandy dancer therefore had brought
 boltons desk to bear on the door as a
 battering ram with which to smash himself
 out of custody the car trembled and
 rocked back and forth on its springs from
 the force of the blows suddenly it began to
 move down grade

   sims sprang nimbly up the ladder and
 strained against the brake wheel but the
 brake seemingly could not be applied the
 mechanism had not been used for months
 or years perhaps it was rusty and in-
 effective the stutterer uselessly spent his
 strength in an attempt to coerce the re-
 fractory device and while he strove the
 car gained speed great shadowy bulks of
 mountains seemed suddenly to be rushing
 up at him out of the darkness and the
 stutterers timid soul quaked with terror
 he realized that descent from the car with-
 out injury had become out of the question
 therefore abandoning his futile efforts to
 tighten the brake he flattened himself
 cautiously full length along the roof of the
 car grasping the brake-post with both
 hands to steady himself

   he quailed with apprehension of a splin-
 tering crash that might come at any mo-
 ment in case the runaway left the rails or
 collided head-on with an approaching train
 a frantic screaming that rose shrilly above
 the dull roar of the flying box-car told him
 that the prisoner gryce was likewise aware
 of the grave peril it was just as well for
 the other two-submerged in merciful
 drunkenness-that they did not know

  mile after mile the commissary car
 plunged downward through the foot-hills of
 the alleghanies thumping violently on its
 straining springs careening around curves
 and filling the still air with the menacing
 thunder of its flight past a little hillside
 station it sped sims could see the operator
 start up from his instrument and peer
 sharply through the window into the dark-
 ness as they flashed by

   colburn thought the stutterer ten
 miles from drayton next station mid-
 vale-eight miles farther-end of the
 grade

   he feared the colburn operator would
 wire midvale to switch them off because
 they were running south on the northbound
 track this operator naturally would have
 no means of knowing that the runaway car

carried human freight gryces yells for
some reason had subsided and the gandy
dancer had extinguished the light before the
car had left drayton sims himself was
utterly incapable of a shout-moving a
mountain would have been an equally easy
task for him at the time

 junction vvhert

jay car stopped	 barn

   just north of midvale the grade suddenly
 spent itself and the speed of the car dimin-
 ished but even as sims was drawing a
 breath of thankfulness over the thought
 that all danger was past he espied the mid-
 vale operator rushing lantern in hand over
 to the switch sims-unable to shout-
 pulled himself upright clutching the brake
 wheel

   he was seen at last-but a second too
 late the commissary car took the switch
 at forty miles an hour reeled left the
 rails plowed into the road bed-an inter-
 minable procession of long-tailed comets
 seemed to flash before the stutterers eyes
 its sims

   whos sims bill

  stuttrin sims-a gandy out at th
 camp th operator says he couldnt find
 nuthin busted about him-landed in a pile
 o cinders face needs a coupla yards o
 court-plaster-thats all

   the stutterer opened his eyes and stared
 wonderingly at the big man bending over
 him he seemed to be lying in a railroad
 depot where trainmen and passengers were
 crowding curiously about presently
 spurred by returning consciousness he
 staggered dazedly to his feet

   hes all right bill bring him in the
 smoker with us he can spit out the story
 on his way back to drayton

  hell need all that time-an then
 some grunted the big man picking sims
 up bodily and carrying him trainward

adventure

jim pidgins sour visage wore
unmistakable signs of demon
drink the tight-fisted proprietor
of the pidgin coop always loosened his
purse strings a little and caroused more than
usual when his old friends the woodchoppers
came out of the woods whenever he drank
he became reckless and impulsive and these
same qualities-recklessness and impulsive-
ness-had trapped him the night previous
into a purchase of stolen goods he was at
last beginning the descent to sobriety after
an all-night session with the woodchoppers
in fact some of these latter were still at the
bar-nearly a dozen of them-burly loud-
voiced roughnecks indulging in woods
badinage and argument and steadily drink-
ing themselves into deeper drunkenness

  the saloon-keeper while serving a strang-
er witli a glass of beer felt a sudden twinge
of uneasiness the man wore a collar and
necktie this fact in itself was not exactly
remarkable but taken in conjunction with
certain other peculiarities of the young
mans person it afforded a clue to his identi-
ty pidgin of late had been accustomed to
hear much of a certain wite-collar stiff
who had also been repeatedly referred to
by some customers as a teetotlin kid
and a rummy-hater moreover he
pidgin had been assured that this kid
when overtaken by a certain calamity that
threatened him-would beat it or fly the
coop or indulge in some similar form of
ignominious self-effacement

  pidgin looking over his dirty bar into
the kids unswerving gray eyes began
therefore to entertain some doubts as to his
wisdom in having pulled off a nocturnal deal
with a couple of bar-room bums and a
drunken camp cook true this was a wild
part of the state and raw things were
being continually pulled off and gotten away
with but-there were the black hussars
a sudden recollection of the intrepidity of
pennsylvanias mounted police added con-
siderably to pidgins uneasiness those
men were known to be daring devils it
was popular knowledge that they were at all
times ready to ride rough-shod-even one
or two of them-into resistance of any kind
armed or unarmed without heed to num-
bers or any other phase of an opposing
danger furthermore they usually got
what they went after

  while meditating upon these things the
saloon-keepers unsteady fingers poured

him out a great drink of liquor which he
gulped at a draught

  hey jim bawled one of the wood-
choppers reprovingly drinkin alone
be yu whar d we come in

  pidgin being a miser was naturally
possessed of a limited degree of craftiness
his perturbed gaze swung from the stranger
at the bar and alighted on the burly forms
of the carousing woodchoppers their
strong arms and knotty fists would he
reasoned be invaluable in a sudden emer-
gency such as a case of rough house
brotherliness therefore had little part in
the feeling that prompted him to refill their
whiskey glasses the choppers thereupon
roared out a drunken toast and pledged
their uncouth friendship pidgins glass
was also taking effect he felt brave-
defiant-right down to his toe-nails the
dozen husky brawlers from the woods
aligned themselves in his alcoholized brain
as a strong defensive cohort moreover
had he not in his possession the cooks
receipt for the money that would let him
out

  pidgins forebodings miraculously left
him and faded into the reeking saloon air
he leaned familiarly over the bar toward the
stranger who while glancing curiously about
the bar-room was still sipping his beer

  yu frum th camp over thar he mildly
inquired

  im the clerk was the customers terse
reply

  the saloon-keeper ruminated searching
the gray eyes and attempting to grasp what
lay behind them they were baffling gray
eyes though and whatever lay behind
them so far as pidgin was concerned was
out of sight the clerk spoke again his
voice was smooth his words well-articulated
and bearing no hint of anxiety or excite-
ment

  im looking for a man named gryce and
a man named slade and also our camp cook
-beehan i understand they were over
here last night doing a little business with
you

  this was very disconcerting news to the
saloon-keeper and he naturally wondered
just how much more the clerk knew his
intelligence informed him at once that a
complete denial was out of the question his
limited craftiness prompted him to admit
the deal with reservations

  wal yore cook feller was here i took
the commissary in the hills



a lit stock frum him-paid him fur it he
acknowledged cautiously

  pidgins readiness to admit so much
proved his undoing boltons eyes were
boring mercilessly into his impelling him to
protect himself-by falling still deeper into
the trap

  got his signatoor continued the flus-
tered saloon-keeper fumbling about in his
cash drawer for the document which he
presently flourished a moment defiantly in
front of the clerks eyes before returning it
to the drawer almost instantly he realized
his mistake but the harm had been done
bolton was far from being in the class of the
illiterates who must stare at and ponder
over a document to absorb its details the
clerks eyesight was excellent and the pro-
cesses of his brain ran like quicksilver he
deciphered the whole of the clumsy scripture
at a glance

  two hundred dollars he exclaimed
sharply so thats what those three cheap
crooks got for looting my commissary car
and peddling over a thousand dollars worth
of company supplies and you went down
to the track at midnight and received the
stolen goods

  bolton gazed in disgust at the man who
had connived at the robbery of food from
the very mouths of his gang pidgin feeling
his props kicked from beneath his feet and
wondering how the details of the dirty deal
had become known kept groping about in
his clumsy consciousness for some manner
of evasion until finding none he fell back
upon the last resort of trapped men of his
type he began to bluster

  yore cook had th thorty t sell didnt
he he exploded harshly

  he had not replied bolton sternly
and you knew it

  the violence of the argument drew the
maudlin woodchoppers away from their
drink

  wats th lizzie tryin t put over on
yu jim bawled one of them belligerently
wat yu say-put im out

  this strong arm offer encouraged pidgin
who are yu anyway but a measly
pencil pusher he howled sneeringly i
dont know yu wether yure givin me
gas or not i been a-doin bizness wit
yore cooks all long th big feller peddled
me some stuff too

  i dont believe it exclaimed the clerk
indignantly garvey was square

  aw cm outside an tell it t th world
jack bawled a woodsman roughly

  two huge grimy paws fastened them-
selves about boltons shoulders and began
dragging him toward the door he twisted
furiously out of the bear-like clasp and
struck hard there was a clatter of broken
glass as the bully fell suddenly against the
bar upsetting a decanter of whisky and
spilling several glasses of the same the
saloon-keeper began cursing frightfully
the clerk found himself surrounded by the
half-drunken woodchoppers all striving
at once to get a clout at him but he sober
and possessed of a deadly coolness was
fighting his way successfully to the exit
when the burly ruffian who had at first
molested him caught him unexpectedly from
behind and yanked him backward upon the
floor

  wat yu say jim-put th boots t im
the poor clerk was in a terrible predica-
ment the brutal chopper was standing
over him-his right foot shod with a heavy
lumbermans calked boot held poised above
the face of the intended victim pidgin
leered immediate encouragement in the
atrocious design one second more and
the cruel calks would have been driven into
boltons defenseless face marring his fea-
tures for life but before the brute could per-
form the intended mayhem a huge figure
had stridden through the open doorway
and shot forward a long upthrust straight
from the hip down crashed the bully upon
the floor as if he had suddenly been hit by
a pile-driver

  bill garvey was boltons astonished
exclamation

  he regained his feet with athletic swift-
ness

  its yu an me clerk grunted the old
cook crane an sims aint strong on th
rough stuff watch yurself

  garvey shot out his sledge-hammer right
and felled a big chopper who had aimed
a blow at the clerk the cook and the
clerk gradually fought their way through
the avenging woodsmen and gained the
doorway through which peered the fright-
ened eyes of sims	
go an tell th gandys roared garvey
to the stutterer yu cant do no good

  of c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-course--

  sims fleet feet were already skimming
skilfully over the rocky pathway

  me belly tinks me troats cut

  sixty gandy dancers with power in their
pockets hiked swiftly along the trail leading
to the pidgin coop they were eager to feel
the flow of red liquor through their veins
under its stimulus they would find no diffi-
culty in lifting their spirits to the necessary
pitch of enthusiasm to rid the outfit of the
white-collared tyrant whom they alleged to
be the cause of their misfortunes

  wat th --s this a-comin

  the foremost gandy dancers stopped in
amazement at sight of a bareheaded appari-
tion skimming swiftly toward them along
the trail the mans face was badly
scratched he was pop-eyed and almost
breathless

  stuttrin sims wats th matter
simsy

  of c-c-c-cc-c-c-c-course-

  aw wissel it

  dont yu know th deef-an-dumb al-
fybet

  with a despairing gurgle the stutterer at
last abandoned the idea of communicating
his message by word of mouth he pointed
with a wild-eyed significance toward the
saloon and began immediately running back
thither beckoning the gandys to follow
these queer antics caused a quick general
stampede in the direction of the pidgin
coop fast through the woods at the heels
of the fleet-footed stutterer rushed the
wondering gandys bursting at last upon the
scene of the battle that was raging outside
the saloon door they saw crane the
companys runner bolton the clerk and
their old kitchen deity bill garvey fight-
ing for their lives against the vicious assaults
of a dozen half-drunken shouting cursing
woodchoppers jim pidgin stood in the
saloon doorway an evil sneer on his face
he seemed to be holding something in his
hand suddenly a glittering object hurtled
through the air and the clerk fell to the
ground

  by- pidgin yu murdrin hound

i saw yu sling that bottle panted garvey
into th joint fellers an clean it out

that-gin-slingin short-changin crook

stole yur eats an now looks as if hes killed

  garveys voice gained strength and rose
to a roar as he sucked wind into his heaving
lungs the frightened woodchoppers out-
numbered five to one stumbled back into
the bar-room pidgin his face suddenly
gone white took shelter behind his bar
crane bent over the injured man shouting
to one of the gandys to fetch water from
the pump

  now roared the fighting cook foller

me

  a score of husky gandy dancers with gar-
vey at their head burst into the bar-room

  rough house cried pidgin desperately

  his henchmen well-nigh winded and
yelling frantically for more liquor were in
no condition to answer his appeal big bill
swept aside the out-thrust arms of a couple
of choppers leaned over the bar caught
pidgin under the arm-pits and yanked him
brutally back over his bulwark he struck
the saloon-keeper once and then threw him
contemptuously into a corner where he lay
his nose spouting blood

  naw-i didnt git them flippers slingin
hash pidgin he bellowed mirthfully
now youse gandys make a clean-up-
d yu hear

  responsive to their old cooks furious
exhortations the gandys launched the full
force of their sobriety fed by the rage re-
sulting from their grievances at the fallen
saloon-keepers wavering cohort they
surrounded the woodsmen hemmed them
in jabbed them cut and pummeled them
a gandy is one of the toughest and most
muscular of the whole migratory branch of
civilized man when he wants to he can
fight

  give em their own medicine bawled
garvey unmercifully they was twelve t
three agin us an still that blasted skunk in
th corner had t heave a bottle

  the little bar-room rocked with the tread
of stumbling feet oaths and frightful
revilings rose on all sides glasses were
snatched from the bar and sent whizzing
through the air window panes began
crashing the long bar mirror-pidgins
the commissary in the hills



pride-slithered into fragments pidgin
got dizzily upon his feet and stood watching
with wild eyes the destruction of his den
garvey made a circular swipe at his bleed-
ing face over the heads of two or three
fighters with the flat of his palm pidgin
fell again with a groan

  some of the choppers had fallen battered
and spent they were being trampled
make a clean-up-d yu hear

  big bills deep voice came in rumbling
gasps out of his heaving chest his rugged
face was cut bruised and bleeding his
steel-gray eyes glowed red bull-like he
fought on

  an enterprising gandy scouting behind
the bar in quest of refreshment overturned
a demijohn of brandy whether by acci-
dent or prompted by a pure love of devil-
try some one threw a lighted match into the
liquor was not known however a sheet of
flame leaped up suddenly behind the bar and
excited cries of fire fire mingled with
a loud clattering of horses hooves without

  th black hussars cried a frightened
voice

  two stalwart black-uniformed mounted
policemen with icy determination in their
eyes and revolvers in their hands forced
their way into the burning saloon

  give way they commanded sharply
give way for the police

jim pidgins sour face wore un-
mistakable signs of combat his
broken nose was badly swollen and
discolored his cracked lips were still
bleeding the fire of an impotent wrath
burned in his bloodshot eyes while he stood
gazing at the heap of ashes and smoking
debris that but an hour previous had been
the pidgin coop the unscrupulous saloon-
keeper-not content with legitimate busi-
ness-had coveted his patrons very sub-
sistence his covetousness had reacted to
his utter ruin

  do you want to make any complaint
pidgin turned to the constable standing
beside him but before he could reply to the
question crane said quietly

  if he makes a complaint i demand his
arrest on two charges-receiving stolen
goods and assault with intent to kill i have
a number of witnesses

  pidgin bit his bleeding lips and stifled an
oath crane turned on his heel and walked
over to the barn where the stolen supplies

had been located-in a secret cache under
the hay-by stuttering sims several
gandys were engaged in the work of getting
the goods together for transport back to the
camp

  say young fellow said the runner
jovially garvey tells me youre a hasher
i can give you a job of crum boss in this
camp-or i can get you a job cooking in
another camp which do you want

  of c-c-c-c-c-c-course protested the

stutterer  the c-c-c-c-c-

  cook or crum boss persisted the run-
ner winking at the grinning gandys

   -c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-

  oh well make it cook decided crane
with a laugh you wont peddle our stock
anyway

  sims sighed he was forever falling into
responsibility

      haw haw haw is that th best
va youse gandys kin do on pay-day
garvey gave vent to a deep
rumble of merriment around the pump
that stood in the yard of the defunct pidgin
coop a motley crowd of men was gathered
washing blood from their faces and hands
and endeavoring to erase from their persons
the signs of recent conflict frequently one
of the gandys would lift a great dipper of the
cool water to his parched lips and guzzle its
refreshing contents with evident satisfac-
tion

  whoever heard of a gandy drinkin
water on pay-day went on the old cook
derisively two weeks ago yu was throw-
in yur pay wads acrost this pirates bar

  sure-i was jist as big a sucker as youse

  by force replied the old cook soberly
 i got a right jab t th jaw that started me

  there was a savage earnestness about the
old cooks words that made his hearers
think restlessly they fingered the unspent
pay-rolls in their overalls pockets it would
be a decidedly unusual feeling for them to
awaken next morning sober and fit for
work with their money still intact more-
over as a recompense for the loss of their
pay-djiy carouse they had a delightful
mental vista of long successions of tasty
puddings and tender brown flapjacks con-
cocted by their old cooks master hand

  the crowd of gandy dancers indulged in
an uneasy shuffling of feet and began look-
ing guiltily at one another

admitted one of them sheepishly

  hooray fur th clerk an th cook
yelled a jubilant fourth

  h-o-o-r-a-y came a thunderous accla-
mation from the throats of half a hundred
gandy dancers

  the sudden roar carried consternation
into the hearts of a forlorn little group of
woodchoppers who stood near by then it
echoed its way gradually out of the valley
and lost itself in the hills

  a pale-faced young man sitting beside 
the pump and holding a wet handkerchief
to his cut and aching head tried vainly to

 camp-fire

a fpee-to-al
meeting place
for readers
writers and
adventurers

   our camp-fire came into being may   with our june issue and since then
its fire has never died down many have gathered about it and they are of all classea
and degrees high and low rich and poor adventurers and stay-at-homes and from all
parts of the earth some whose voices we used to know have taken the long trail
and are heard no more but they are still memories among us and new voices are
heard and welcomed

   we are drawn together by a common liking for the strong clean things of out-of-
doors for word from the earths far places for man in action instead of caged by cir-
cumstance the spirit of adventure lives in all men the rest is chance

   but something besides a common interest holds us together somehow a real com-
radeship has grown up among us men can not thus meet and talk together without
growing into friendlier relations many a time does one of us come to the rest for facts
and guidance many a close personal friendship has our camp-fire built up between
two men who had never met often has it proved an open sesame between strangers
in a far land

   perhaps our camp-fire is even a little more perhaps it is a bit of leaven working
gently among those of different station toward the fuller and more human understand-
ing and sympathy that will some day bring to man the real democracy and brotherhood
he seeks few indeed are the agencies that bring together on a friendly footing so many
and such great extremes as here and we are numbered by the hundred thousand now

   if you are come to our camp-fire for the first time and find you like the things we
like join us and find yourself very welcome there is no obligation except ordinary
manliness no forms or ceremonies no dues no officers no anything except men and
women gathered for interest and friendliness your desire to join makes you a member

a few words from f r bechdolt in
connection with his article in this issue

                                    san francisco
jno w poe and chas siringo gave me the data
poe gave most of it in the kids death youll
note i spoke of the mexican warning him this is
poes idea and was garrets-so poe tells me poe
is the only survivor of the posse he is president
of a bank in roswell n m in the kids escape
i have bell reading to the kid-or rather looking
for an item to read to him he was reading the
paper that was told by the kid to associates who
told siringo afterward jim east who helped cap-
ture him maintained the kid must have lured bell
to a position where the kid could steal his gun
i took the kids account and easts theory and
pieced them together

the kid went to sumner because he was smitten
with a relative of pete maxwells how much
the girl cared for him is problematical he had a
way with women-so say east and others who


knew him well but jno w poe says that after
the shooting the girl showed no particular emotion
so there you are

  in the details of the kids death i stick to jno
w poes narrative he was there and saw it
moreover he is a particularly reliable man when it
comes to giving data i want to thank jno w poe
james h east charles siringo and others and to
recommend to any readers siringos lone star
cowboy in which he recites portions of this same
tale together with other experiences it is a book
of facts-f r bechdolt

most of us arent very wise in the his-
tory of ancient asia-or the asia of
a few centuries ago or even the asia of
today so when harold lamb does the work
of digging it out and handing it to us on a
platter it tastes pretty good

berkeley california

  our school histories in fact all of our histories
put together do not give us much of an idea of
central asia in the year  it was that year and
place however that saw the passing of the giants

wing to this blank space in history-unwritten
because no well-known battle took place there-
in or any court cabal or secret confessions of any
lady in waiting-the writer will try to sketch the
scene a little the great empire of genghis khan
had been broken up five hundred years ago the
wave of nomads the mongols from the steppe
country of central asia had settled back

  so the name of the mighty conqueror genghis
khan was only a legend in the land the grim figure
of the lame timur called tamerlane in european
histories had held its sway among the mountains
of central asia and rested now in the tomb

  other nomads the chagatai mongols-called by
us the moguls-had arisen in the mountains north
of afghanistan had ruled india with splendor and
wisdom but their descendants of the peacock throne
were only effigies who watched the incoming of the
portuguese french and english warren hastings
is mentioned in our histories

  but india itself is separated from central asia by
the himalayas and only tibet had a hand in the
passing of the giants tibet-as we call it the
inhabitants term it po and the castle-temple at
lhassa the po-tala-was the religious center of
central asia a kind of transmountain pope ruling
over a hierarchy of priests with spies disciples
and a fine system of news collection by mounted
couriers the authority of the dalai lama or king-
priest extended from the chinese side of the gobi
desert pekin to the outposts of the russian armies
on the volga and from lhassa to the arctic circle

tn other words the dalai lama had made
himself spiritual master of a space about as
large as the united states of america this space-
steppe land in the center deserts and mountains
on three sides the frozen tundras of siberia then
called russian tatary to the north-was still held
by the nomad tribes the tatars they were not
however the united horde of genghis khan but
groups of separate tribes herdsmen with vague
traditions of former battles

  some were under russian rule others-in the

gobi region-were existing under the firm but
benevolent hand of chien-lung who was emperor
of china at the time of chinas greatest power
some more of the tatar clans were imbued with
mohammedanism or were allies of the dalai lama
but they were-and are to this day-independent
chaps the torguts especially-the clan called the
giants

tphe torguts about  during the brief empire
of galdan khan in the mountains of central
asia the empire touched upon in the story the
wolf chaser refused servitude and migrated west
as far as the russian border on the volga there
they built villages and remained contented enough
with fighting and cattle raising

  meanwhile the various muscovite states were
absorbed into an expanding empire under the vigor-
ous hand of peter the great and after him cathe-
rine the torguts were threatened with taxation
and with seizure of their sons by the russians to
escape servitude a second time they chose to migrate
to their homeland at the headwaters of the river ili
then unoccupied chien-lung had extended them
an invitation to do so

  and they did it at the time no one thought it
possible the  distance was three thousand miles
it was then the dead of winter on the snow-bound
steppe they had the disadvantage of covering the
coldest region of their journey in a temperature
around zero and crossing the two deserts and the
alai bagh in mid-summer they also had their
herds with all their possessions to transport

estimates as to the numbers of the torguts
vary somewhat pallas calculates that 
torguts set out from the volga the annals of chien-
lung mention  to  tents more than

	persons but it is known that only 
survived to reach the ili in other words seven out
of about seventeen souls lived through the journey

  you see they had to fight their way the tribes
along their route and especially to the south were
hostile the moslems vindictive the cossacks gave
them two stiff battles and their own lamas were
deceitful-anxious to betray them if anything was
to be gained by it

  this journey of the giants has been called a
colossal trek so it vvas-the last of the great men-
movements of the world

as to the rate of progress made by the tatars
i have set it down as it happened thirty to
fifty miles a day at times under the conditions
sounds like a tall order yet it was done also the
 miles of the hunger steppe or desert was
traversed in three days this was necessary be-
cause the yellow water was found to be un-
drinkable

  how they managed for fodder for the herds on the
snow steppe i do not know of course the beasts
died off rapidly and it is rather a miracle that a
portion of the herds endured for the first half of the
journey as for the camels they got along well
enough and the ponies it seems dug into the snow
at times for grass underneath

n their journey they carried off a european
who appears in the story this man was
eventually released and sent back with a quota of
followers reaching the russian border safe after
the camp-fire



earning the confidence of the tatars the character
of zebek dortshi chief of the red camel clan is
puzzling first because i have not seen otherwhere
any record of a tatar noble who betrayed his clan
and the name itself has not a tatar sound so i
have set him down as being one of the ilkhan chiefs
a man with persian blood in him

  the cult of the bonpas among the tibetan monks
has a curious story magic originally had no part
in the buddhist ritual of the tsong-kapa but the
disciples of buddhism who were establishing them-
selves in tibet about  ad found the native
devil-worship too strong to wipe out so the home-
bred conjurers the mik-thru tse khen were enrolled
in the priesthood of the buddhists eventually the
devil-worshipers became the prime movers among
the mountain monks so the originally humane
doctrines of the sakyas became a most degenerate
thing to-day in lhassa there is a quarter of the
town devoted to the magicians

  the torguts are usually mentioned as kalmuks
the word kalmuk is turkish and means something
like remnant of a tree it is a kind of nickname
and to-day is applied to various native tribes in
turkestan and mongolia but the tatar clan of
the story called themselves torgut the giants and
that is their rightful name

was quetzal a norseman theories
concerning the early aztecs and
toltecs are always interesting

san francisco

  read the last six copies in mexico i guess every-
thing will remain o k lown there until they elect
a new president i understand that several new
candidates are passing out election cards ballots

ne of the comrades was asking the question
     wa quetzal a norseman

   now as i have done quite a little research work in
mexico as well as egypt i would like to state that
i think he was

  here is a short synopsis of the life of quetzal or
quetzalcoatl the name has the same meaning as
the mayan kukulcan or quiche gugumatz that is
translated plumed serpent quetzal was the chief
deity of cholula one of mexicos oldest cities still
inhabited at the coming of the spaniards he was
an early king of miraculous birth his mother was
a virgin ruler in the city of tula about  miles
north of the present city of mexico

  he was entirely unlike his people the toltecs
having a fair skin and a long white beard and wear-
ing a flaring white mantle with the figure of a cross
embroidered on it in red he took no wife but
founded convents for women sworn to chastity and
devoted to temple worship he taught peace and
universal brotherhood and under his rule war was
unknown

  by the very evil works of a wizard he was finally
dethroned offering no resistance to this he claimed
that the time had came for him to return to his
father promising to come again with others in the
year of acatl which was then far distant

   so he started on his journey stopping  years at
cholula where he taught the mysteries of his re-
ligion to the inhabitants who naturally became
priests of his creed the great pyramid at this city
was the mecca of the aztec and toltec religions

really they were one when he arrived at the sea-
shore he sailed into the sunrise on a raft of serpents

this is as much as can be given in a short space

   in my mind there is no doubt that he was a
norseman there is the fair skin and the fact that
he possessed a knowledge far superior to the un-
tutored natives so much so that it was thought
divine the pyramids of his religion too always
made me think of the burial mounds of the early
vikings which i have seen that he preached peace
instead of war proves very little as on many of their
cruises the vikings carried songsters and story-
tellers who were never considered fighters also
the fierce toltec war god came into being during his
reign or just after and was claimed to be his brother
so it might have been that after a fierce storm only
two survivors arrived in mexico from some ship
perhaps one was a captive from some other country
or perhaps quetzal was a descendant of one of the
men

  by the greatest freak of history the spaniards
landed in  the year of acatl

  hope this answers all questions in this subject-
the grizzley

something from arthur mallory of
our writers brigade concerning wourali
or curare poison and its effect on game killed
with darts dipped in it

southern pines north carolina

  in camp-fire some time ago i saw a query
about the use of arrow-poisons by south american
indians in killing game

  practically all central and south american
indians such as use poisoned arrows at all use the
same poison-wourara ouari urari wourali
woorari curara or curare as it is variously called
it is the dried juice of a species of strychnos a com-
mon enough plant in those regions and its active
principle is the alkaloid curarine chn which
is highly poisonous its physiological action is to
paralyze the end-plates of motor nerves thus
without affecting the central nervous system at all
it causes complete paralysis of all muscles death
is due to paralysis of heart and respiratory-muscles
curare has no other action it does not affect con-
sciousness nor is it anesthetic

  though it has been used in tetanus lock-jaw in
doses of - to - grain it is rarely used as a
medicine but it is very largely used in laboratory
experiments upon animals because it does abolish
the possibility of movement without affecting either
consciousness or sensibility

  but all that is by the way the important and
interesting thing about curare is that it is inert
unless introduced directly into the body-fiuids it
can be swallowed even in large quantities without
ill effects because it is broken up in the stomach
by the digestive process introduced into the blood-
stream however by hypodermatic injection or by
a dart knife or arrow impregnated with it curare is
highly poisonous it acts almost instantly paralyz-
ing all muscles so that its victim drops at once
inert and that victim may be eaten with impunity
because as i have said curare is broken up during
digestion of course if one had a gastric ulcer or
open wound of stomach aesophagus or mouth
enough curare might enter the blood-stream to cause
io

adventure

death and i have seen one or two natives-in
brazil-die while eating game knocked over with
curare-poisoned arrows undoubtedly because of this
very thing as a rule it is perfectly safe though to
eat game thus killed i have done it myself

  so that settles the dispute about indians eating
game killed with poisoned arrows of course they
do as your correspondent wasnt it arthur o
friel said they did and thats why they can-
arthur mallory

vtoull be interested to know that we

  	now have in the safe a sequel to j
allan dunns barehanded castaways for
which so many of you have been asking

n connection with his story in this
issue max bonter tells us how he feels
about the gandy a name that may be as
strange to you as it was to me lut a name
for a real fellow

	kent n y

  i am tickled over the fact that the gandy is to
have a chance in fiction at last he is the gipsy
of american working men his outfits are part and
parcel of practically every one of our railroads from
canada to mexico i have tamped ties and spiked
rails shoulder to shoulder with him at various times
from the st lawrence to the rio grande also
i have kept his accounts and sold him his sox and
shoe-laces his scrap and his cigarets i think i
know the gandy about as well as anybody

t rather surprizes me that it should have
fallen to my lot to introduce the gandy to the
reading pul lie mafay a time during a free-for-all
on a gandy pay-day or on the occasion of a grub-
strike or the summary chasing of a discredited
hasher out of a camp ive heard old-timers exclaim

  why in-dont some litry guy git hold o

this stuff an write it up

  the question-mark would sometimes be followed
with an instinctive glance in my direction because
i had been caught once or twice jotting down
chinese on a slip of paper i doubt however
that any of the gandys really knew i was a chiei
amang them takin notes

vnce i thought an old-timer had really spotted
me he was only a little gandy but wise and
wizened and old name was ketchum hed
gandied about everything in the u s that was
gandyable-practically everything that consisted
of rails he and i worked as tamping partners for
a while i didnt talk much on the job-was either
dancing the gandy or star-gazing i had ketchum
guessing for two straight weeks he couldnt quite
sabe my strange and abstract mien his eyes often
tried to fathom what lay behind my reserve there
was a gulf between our natures that he couldnt
jump over he was suspicious

  came pay-day then the inevitable rush to the
fount of democracy

 pardner said ketchum to me slamming his
pay-roll upon the bar have a drink

  his wise old eyes were bent searchingly upon
mine i was up against the acid test of partnership
with him and i knew it

 sure came promptly out of me my foot
swung familiarly to the foot-rail my pay-roll lay
beside ketchums our glasses clinked and two
man-size old hill  hill hell  hell as they used
to call it down south splashed simultaneously into
our thirsty gullets ketchum unlimbered so did

i	within five minutes the two of us had left a
trail of bull from the bowery to the barbary

  ketchums face cleared his suspicions of my
high lineage quickly vanished he grinned a whole-
hearted grin of palship

  now im wise t yu pal he grunted with relief

yure ony a--bum like meself drink

up

the commissary in the hills is somewhat
allegorical society is bent upon reforming the
roughneck but i doubt that it will pay the
gandys or in other words the rough elements of
the country dont want near-beer and white collars
to have dollars in the bank may be an agreeable
sensation for them for a time but their needs are
deeper they need plenty of rope plenty of pasture
and a good orgy once in a while to clean them out
chasten them and keep them working a gandy
will stack himself up against a tough job and work
brutally hard at it wdth one object in view-to
have a good jamboree at the end of it in one night
he will gleefully dissipate the proceeds of a months
fierce labor and then go dutifully back to the job
and do it all over again thats what puts the iron
in his blood

  some of the old-timers who read the commis-
sary may recall some of the incidents that inspired
the story i doubt that many of them will remem-
ber the author by name although they might re-
member a red-faced guy who packed a fair wallop
in his right who pulled a poor bum from in front of
an express cow-catcher one time and who when-
ever he had charge of a camp never turned down a
passing gandy for a bit of chow or a flop-max
bonter

 and heres something mr bonter wrote
me about the gandys some time ago
if his theory is correct its our magazine
that introduces the gandys to fiction any-
how these men are worth knowing and there
are seats for them at camp-fire

                                  kent n y

  since the beginning of my acquaintance with him
ten years ago this type has interested me i like
the gipsy part of him he flits over the country
with the idea-not of dodging work but-of looking
for it

yrork in his vocabulary is more than a com-
placent term describing many a modern state
of busyness it means what it ought to mean-
a straining of the faculties toward the accom-
plishment of a task not being much bothered
with intellectualism this of course does not particu-
larly include a straining of his brain tissues al-
though they also i fancy must be brought some-
what into play to induce his muscles to strain
themselves

  well work in gandy lingo means pick shovel
lining-bar spike-maul straining muscles ten hours a
the camp-fire



day im confident that he himself doesnt under-
stand why he likes hard work on the other hand
if i told him bluntly that he did like it hed tell me
im crazy

tt is science isnt far enough advanced to explain
to him just why straining himself makes a
physical man of him he cant just understand
why its easier for a physical man to be a real man
than anybody else his figuring is too elementary
to teach him just why oxygen rushing into his
system ten or twelve hours a day subtracts from
his organism just one certain amount of dead cell-
matter and stimulates his blood to add just one
certain amount in its place of brand new tissue that
keeps him moving and clean his non-acquain-
tance with higher physiology leaves him in ignorance
of the kernel that is growing in his shell ready to
blossom into character when acted upon by proper
environment if you told him that hard work was
making a man out of him hed call you a sky-pilot
in disguise or a holy joe

  he goes through life envying the man who gets
it easy-wondering why he is too dumb to do
the same

  he doesnt understand that he simply doesnt
want the soft fife-that it would destroy him-
probably damn him he is unable to appreciate the
fact that he had developed away from the soft game
and everything in connection with it-that its good
for him only once in a while for a day or two to take
a look at and then getaway from it and go back with
a penitent heart to his shovel and his cinders and his
clean air and his spartan grub

tvell this isnt what you wanted to know-so
far im telling you i was interested in the
gandy on account of these things and on that ac-
count i followed him up and dissected him i lived
in his funny box-caroutfits for several years-at
various times-from the canadian pacific south-
ward ive worked for the c p g t r t h 
b wabash n y c lehigh b r  p j c
n y n h  h st l s w cotton belt santa
fe and maybe one or two others that i havent
time to recall probably all told i didnt work for
any of the mentioned roads longer than several
months-for many of them not longer than a
couple of weeks-for some of them only a few days
my idea was just to get a line on a new outfit-work
a while in a strange gang and see if i couldnt find
some interesting atmospheres and characters

kjow ill try and get down to the brass tacks

    although ive been reading magazines for
twenty-seven or twenty-eight years ive never yet
seen the term gandy dancer in print excepting
once in my little tale the life of riley last
october when i referred to the hero as having been
a gandy before he shipped on the north king

  although ive seen thousands of magazines
many copies of adventure among the number lying
around bunk-cars in gandy dancing camps and
although most of the gandys are readers and some of
them fairly intelligent readers who would be tickled
to death to see themselves in print-ive never yet
heard a single one of them admit that hed seen
himself or any other gandy on a printed page
this includes newspapers as well as magazines

  it seems funny that i should be the one to broach
the gandy i always thought somebody might beat

me to it before i was ready to talk however i
imagine that passing vagabond scribes didnt
stick with the gandy long enough to get really in-
terested in him the grub was probably too fierce-
the tamping-pick and the rock ballast too specially
backbreaking for their sense of humor

j suppose the gandy dancers first cousins the
section men have been written about although
i just dont recall any fiction about them at present
their work is often referred to in newspapers how-
ever at times of wreck they usually live in their
own homes have families and dont voyage much
from their own hearths nowadays they are usually
italian or polish or slavish or swedish or mexican
mestizos-according to the different sections of the
country the work they do is practically the same
as the work required of the gandys

  the gandy outfits are vastly different they
usually travel in box-cars or rebuilt day-coaches-
cook eat and sleep in them in a good gandy
outfit the foremen eat with their men and travel
with them in similar accommodations in former
days the gandys were made up almost entirely of
irish in late years the american hobo has largely
supplanted the irishman although many railroads
to-day have a very strong gandy representation of
corkonians donegallers donneybrookers far-
downers etc-that makes a gandy bunk-car often
an uproariously amusing place to spread a mans
blanket-max bonier

 according to the papers a new york
magistrate has inaugurated the pol-
icy of fining food violators i for every
pound of unwholesome food found in their
possession apparently this policy is so
severe that it is news and gets a box on the
first page of a daily in the countrys largest
city it would seem too that sellers of
unfit food arent very often punished in
any way

  one fellow got a fine of  or five days
for  pounds of candy unfit for human
consumption another  for faulty
almonds a third  for unfit peanut-bars
and walnut puffs i wonder how many
hundred or thousand others among new
yorks millions are selling food unfit for
human consumption ill venture a
chemist could go out and locate quite a
little army of offenders almost any day
nor has new york any monopoly on unfit
food

  all sort of ridiculous isnt it i wonder
just how much human damage  pounds
of candy unfit for human consumption
could do to a little child say or an adult
already in a dangerous condition of health
maybe quite a few cases of ptomaine and
perhaps here or there and maybe not for
weeks afterward a death quite possible
anyhow isnt it and the gent who hands
adventure

it out gets  or five days such a severe
penalty should amply satisfy the sorrowing
family of any one who had passed out as a
direct or indirect result of the selling of this
kind of food also so terrible a penalty
hanging over their heads and put into
operation so seldom that it becomes a mat-
ter of newspaper news will surely terrify all
dealers out of ever again offering food unfit
for human consumption probably never
again as always heretofore will any dealer
in candy meat groceries or vegetables ever
offer to new york any food that isnt
wholly fit five days the awfulness of it
makes the chills run down a fellows back

tt seems to me mighty crude work to
stab a man or shoot him or hit him with
a club thats murder or manslaughter
and may cost you quite a few years in the
penitentiary or even hang or electrocute
you stupid and too risky why not just
start a little food stand of some sort and
get the man-or the woman or the little
child-as a customer no need for hurry
take your time cant you afford to wait
a few weeks or even months dont insist
on direct and crude methods slow poison
isnt always sure but it will certainly do
considerable harm and then who wouldnt
rather take the rather faint risk of five days
instead of the much greater risk of five years
or the electric chair of course youre
likely to poison a few hundred otler people
in whom you have no interest but thats
just part of the days business dont be
in a foolish hurry and give him or her arsenic
or ground glass or anything like that for
somebody to find when the remains are
examined be more patient play it safe
avoid the cell and the noose keep your good
standing in the community do it with a
rotten vegetable a decayed fish or unfit
candy

  furthermore if youre morally inclined
this method isnt wicked while using a gun
knife or club is decidedly wicked just so
your poison comes from a food-store instead
of a drug-store takes twenty-four hours or
longer to act and isnt dead sure to produce
death and just so instead of disciminating
against your victim you poison a whole
neighborhood there isnt anything immoral
about it-merely a little trick of the trade
a well-recognized business method and one
likely to make you eventually a pillar of
society an honor and model for your com-

munity and perhaps a church-member of
the first water while on the other hand the
worst youre likely to get is five days or
a dollar a pound

nor has the public any sound reason
to object i put it to you personally-
if a fellow sold you a pound of food that
made you feel miserable for several days or
maybe poisoned off one or two of your
kids or anyhow ran you up a doctors bill
for them wouldnt you feel more than
amply satisfied if that fellow had to pay the
city i he might you know it does
happen sometimes as the newspaper notice
shows

  its funny though when you come to
think it over the law soaks it to you if
you beat a man up with your fist or a brick
or break a womans arm or kick a child in
the stomach but if youre more subtle
about it and do much the same thing in the
way of business instead of for personal
amusement why that costs you only five
days maybe probably not or i per pound
which is a price any good sport or good busi-
ness man ought to be willing to pay in the
circumstances kick the little childs stom-
ach from the inside and be safe and cover
up your tracks by doing it to a lot of them
instead of just one thus being able to prove
lack of personal animus also its darned
hard to prove anything on you anyway
even if some of em happen to die as a result
of getting rotten food at just the wrong
time

  i wonder just what the law means by
manslaughter and mayhem and as-
sault and whether the law has any real
relation to the facts of life-and death i
wonder just what poisoning means and
whether the poison victim and his relatives
and friends care an awful lot whether the
poison took a few minutes or a few weeks or
months to get in its final work or whether
the poison came from a food-store or a drug-
store somehow i cant quite see why
poisoning people broadcast and by degrees
as part of your regular business is a trivial
matter while poisoning just one fellow
roughly and all at once is such a terrible and
wicked affair

  oh well lets go to lunch and take a
chance id rather be poisoned anyhow than
do a little thinking to say nothing of taking
any action wouldnt you sure we would
were proving that all the time
the camp-fire



tjollowing camp-fire custom john
joseph scarry rises to introduce him-
self on the occasion of his first story in our
magazine

brookline mass

  long before the idea ever came to me that i might
be able to write a story i was a more or less constant
reader of adventure and ever a sincere admirer of
the enthusiasm and the spirit of good-fellowship
manifested by readers and writers in camp-fire
primarily i think to earn the right to slip into your
company i wrote and offered partners a humble
offering i am well aware

fy life has not been adventurous except
perhaps in mileage considerably more than
a fifth of a century was spent in grooming me for
ome remunerative service in the jungle which lies
between massachusetts bay and the hudson river
because of this probably i have spent the years
since my entry into the world of affairs in the dutch
east indies there i developed a little any latent
talent i may possess by pounding out vain exhorta-
tions to various and sundry american importers and
exporters who chanced to employ me the exhorta-
tions were vain you will notice so just now i am
letting american foreign trade struggle along with-
out me

  i have done some hunting and have climbed
several volcanoes in java for a few months during
my only furlough i vacationed in the army in-
cidentally i was promoted to corporal because i
was the only man in my squad who could speak
english my proudest achievement is the three
months i spent last summer as a wiper on a ship-
ping board freighter irom soerabaya to new york
by way of the mediterranean ports but my life
has never been threatened by howling savages nor
have i ever faced anything more dangerous than
a disgruntled fellow-human with two fists

  i can only hope that the future will bring me
opportunity to get better acquainted with you all-
john joseph scarry

our new assaying service

please note that in a a were offer-
ing a new service to readers not a free
one but one with charges so light that they
are merely nominal when compared to the
fee usually asked h c wire formerly of
our magazines staff will give a general
estimate of what minerals are present in
specimens sent him by readers a dollar
is asked for this service note carefully
that only a general estimate is given not
the minute analysis usually given by pro-
fessional assayers but note also that the
charge is only something like i to  the
main point is the expert general opinion
as to commercial value

questions on oil and minerals not accom-

panied with samples will be answered on
the same general plan as in other sections
of a a

 neither mr wire nor the magazine
assumes any responsibility beyond fair
dealing and sincere endeavor read over
the conditions dont blame any one but
yourself if you fail to get satisfactory reply
through yourself failing to comply with all
the necessary conditions	 

  looks to me as if this service ought to be
of decided value to quite a few of you lets
try it out and see how it works suggestions
welcomed

 heres mr wires statement

 specimens to be tested should be about half the
size of a mans fist they are best shipped by
parcel post in a small canvas sack-one-pound salt
bag will do-or they can be wrapped and put in a
cigar-box

  samples should be carefully marked with senders
name letters concerning samples will have to
come separately so it is important that both letter
and sample have senders name attached

  as a guide to me letter should tell something of
the country from which rock sample comes-some-
thing of the mass in which it occurs-a description
of other rocks about it also what mining activ-
ities if any are being carried on in the locality
state what particular mineral is sought in sample

  but dont tell exact location or anything that
might give away a good find

  samples can not be returned as they are usually
destroyed in process of analysis

  i will give a general estimate of what minerals are
present telling whether or not the sample submitted
seems to indicate an ore of commercial value

a lso questions answered regarding possible
indications of oil this can be but a rough
opinion however surface conditions of the coun-
try often indicate whether the chances of there
being oil beneath are good slight or not at all

  a general description of the lay of the land should
be given stating whether mountainous hilly or
flat position of rock-beds if exposed and kind of
rock

  in this i can help greatly by referring the in-
quirer to state and u s geological survey bulletins
which may give valuable information on exact
locality from which inquiry comes

  qualifications prep school and university
courses in mineralogy crystallography and geology
field work for the u s geological survey oil
geology for the texas company independent
rock-hounding in california

  besides my own outfit i have access to the labora-
tory of pomona college of california

  i assume no obligation or responsibility beyond
honesty and best endeavor

vxith a few words concerning vikings
  fish game and one of the most beau-
tiful railroad trips in the world

  question-i would like to get information about
norway its people customs and lingo my great-
grandfather was born in the land of the midnight
sun were the vikings the first to arrive in america

  im going over to norway shortly and i would
like to know where i should apply to get permission
to land i intend to go hunting and fishing

  how are the people to get along with is it very
hard to learn the languages what kinds of game
and fish are to be found it will be a great help for
me to have your advice and information-julius
helberg city point va

  answer by mr townsend-coming as you do
from norwegian stock you naturally know some-
thing concerning the people and their country
however in addition i would say that they are a

very stolid substantial race those people living
in the interior and in the remote parts of the country
are very reserved the other parts of the population
living along the lines of communication or on the
sea coast are of course in a sense broader than their
mountaineer brothers

  in general life is taken more seriously over there
than in this country family life is made a great
deal of as are all feast days and occasions such as
weddings christmas new year etc but even
though you may be in a very out-of-the-way part
of the country you will never fail to find them most
hospitable and kindly in every way and having
norwegian blood in your veins will be an extra asset
in getting to know their intimate thoughts ideas
and customs

  the lingo you also must have heard something
about if you have never seen it and want to get an
idea about it i should advise you to write to bren-
tanos book-store  f street washington
d c and obtain an english-norwegian phrase
book which will be of value to you in your travels
as well as letting you get a glance at the way the


adventure

language looks ask for the universal series the
book is twenty-five cents

  information concerning the arrival of the vikings
upon the shores of the north american continent
is very vague the old norse and icelandic sagas
set forth at great length about leif ericson who in

	ad is said to have sailed over to some part of
what is now new england and called it vinland
but most of this information is not authentic it is
based upon the old sagas concerning these old sea-
rovers and may or may not be true nevertheless
true or not the vikings certainly were a bold lot of
seafaring men and did make very daring trips con-
sidering the ships they used

  as to the fish and game

  along the coast you will find about the same fish
as we have along the maine coast and lots of
salmon the canning of which is one of the largest
industries in norway in the interior and lakes you
will find trout

  in the north and interior you will find elk rein-
deer and a few bear

  when you go over to the eastern part of the
country in the south along the swedish border you
will find all kinds of birds

  to shoot or fish it will be necessary for you to get
a permit for both this is easily obtained and costs
very little

  then when you decide where you will shoot it is
demanded you get permission from the local munici-
pality in which you are going to hunt or fish this
permit is also easily obtained at a small cost

  thus you will have no trouble on that score

  about one month before you go you must write
to the department of state washington d c
bureau for american passports and ask for an
application for a passport which will be sent you
with the necessary instruction for filling it out

  when you have obtained your american pass-
port without it you could not leave the united
states as you will probably sail from new york
you can leave your home about two days earlier than
necessary to catch your ship and get it visaed
stamped by the norwegian consul-general in
new york his office is in the new york telephone
book

  this is also absolutely necessary as you could
not land in norway without it

  there are two steamer lines going from new york
to norway both having fortnightly sailing they
are the norwegian-american line norwegian and
the skandinavian-american line danish

  both are very good with excellent ships and very
good rooms service and meals

  both also make the same ports of call namely
bergen christiansand and kristiania in the order
named

  if you will take a suggestion from me i should
advise you to leave the ship at bergen then go to
kristiania by railroad this trip is one of the most
beautiful in the whole world and should never be
missed if you can afford to take it

  the ideal time to leave would be about the middle
of july you could then have some time to look
around before the shooting season begins which is
for birds the twenty-third of august and for elk
reindeer etc the first of september

  i do hope you enjoy your trip i know you will
once you have seen the country and got to know
the people you will be proud of that norwegian
blood of yours

  ments as given in this issue is printed

he prefers the tarp

why oh just in case a footless
friend should decide to bunk in with

him

  question-the writer is figuring on going on
a hiking trip into the sierra nevadas in the feather
river region hitting the trails

  what in your opinion is best to take a blanket or
a sleeping-bag and why

  what are the necessities in food and equipment
to carry

  will the forestry service furnish me with maps
of the sierras from north to south either free or by
paying for them

  to what forestry office should i send to get the
maps

  from the above questions you can of course tell
that i am an absolute novice in the hiking game
but am willing to try

  a stamped envelop is enclosed-henky c
lind san francisco calif

  answer by mr harriman-i prefer blankets
and a tarp the tarp i use is fourteen feet long by
six wide i lay it out and spread my blankets
on one end then i bring the other end up over
the bed it has all the bag has in the way of com-
fort and it can be used for many other things for
instance it may be stretched to make a roof to keep
out rain or sun

  then too it gives me a chance to slide out of
one side if a rattler comes in the other having
known a friend to entertain a rattler in a sleeping-
bag and not know how to get out unbitten i shy
at bags

another man armed with a club beat the snake
to death while it was still in the bag beside the man

  go to  sansome st san francisco and get
a copy of the handbook for campers  from the
forest service headquarters that tells you more
than ten letters about packing camping food
supplies etc

  there is where you get your maps also they
are free and so is the handbook observe the rules
in the book and you will have no trouble with the
rangers

fauna of south america

  question-please furnish me with information
you may have about the higher altitudes of south
america in regard to hunting and trapping for fur-
bearing animals-e o garoutte green river

  answer by mr young-the following is a par-
tial list of animals both game and otherwise some
fur-bearing tapir guanaco or wild llama alpaca
vicun deer viscacha puma jaguar ocelot spec-
tacled bear coati peccary rabbit squirrel capy-

ask adventure

cat coypu beaver chinchilla a rat-like animal
tuco-tuco dasypus pichiciego and in the sea we
find sea-otters seals sea-elephants and dolphins
the birds range from the giant stork eight feet tall
jabiru or bata down to the smallest of humming-
birds

  fish of all sizes-including the lung-fish of the
chaco which breathes only air and buries itself for
months until the earth is dry and sandy overhead
this fish is dug with a pick and shovel in places
where there has been no water for eighteen months
and whose location is known by a small hole the
fish leaves to breathe through they grow up to
three feet long and store fat on their tails for keeping
them through the long dry seasons there is a certain
eel that does likewise these two are in the chaco
country a district of two hundred and fifty thou-
sand square miles on the borders of bolivia para-
guay and argentine

  the best game country is half-way down the
slopes of the andes on the eastern slopes where any
amount of game can be killed daily canoe parties
running merchandise carry little provisions for this
stretch and depend on what they kill as they travel
along

  the tails of alligators up to three and four feet
long are good eating when roasted over that length
they are musty tasting the natives however eat
all sizes when other grub is scarce although the
expression coms-cayman alligator-eater is
a term of reproach with them

  i would suggest the country across the andes
from quito ecuador it is a -mile hike trip from
there to napo and you dont have to go all the way
to napo but can stop up around archidona and head
along the andes on the napo and cururay rivers
you will be able to kill plenty of game and also
live from natural resources of the country

  please note check list i am attaching

        rearing a one-man dog
guck connors way

  question-although this is outside of your
regular line as ask adventure editor i am taking
the liberty of asking you a question so if you can
not answer it and yet know some one who can
please advise me i am asking you because you are
acquainted with the west i want a real one-man
dog who will not make up and be friends with
everybody and have tried several breeds but can
not find what i want i understand a wolf if raised
as pet makes a pretty good one but is dangerous to
other people so i thought of crossing a dog and
a wolf would this give me what i want if so
could i buy such a pup

  had thought of getting wolf pup and raising it
and breeding for myself yet i understand a wolf is
bad to howl at night so i would not be allowed to
keep one in town is this true if one is raised as pet

  which is best cross male dog and female wolf or
vice versa what kind of dog would you advise to
use this is awfully long-winded but please excuse
and i will not bother you often-j richard
hall east liverpool o

 answer by mr connor-inasmuch as you
have placed your question up to me and recalling
some experience along the fines of cross-breeding

i will say

  	a one-man dog can be reared only as follows
take a mere puppy allow no one to play with it
much less pet it if any one comes near it have
him use a small stick and whip the dog-then
when he comes to you you pet the animal that
gives the dog complete confidence in yu alone
this might seem purely theory but by experience
i know whereof i speak

   i took the fitter of an airedale bitch of high breed-
ing before their eyes were opened and used a metal
whistle to acquaint them with the sound of it as
they licked milk from my finger-tips at the age of
three weeks they would follow that whistle with
little yelps and bounds over stick and undergrowth
that was almost too much for them at the age of
one month i had the litter-six pups-to heel
advancing answering action by the calling of their
names this might seem impossible but i have
much proof for it

  	the wolf when raised as a pet makes quite
a good animal-sometimes depending again upon
his early raising i would not advise a wolf in the
city

  	have you tried a german police dog why
not go and see the silent call a feature photo-
play and see strongheart work he was directed
in german through the medium of megaphone
and worked like a human over half a mile distant
from camera

  	i captured a bitch coyote in  while
trapping in feather river calif i kept her closely
guarded and bred her to a thoroughbred airedale
dog i kept her for two months and while i was
down in southern california she finally got away
from the old prospector-who was nearly blind-
id left her with and went back to her band i won-
der what i missed in a one-man dog by losing her

   i have seen half-coyote and half italian shepherds
with sheep-herders in the mountains but write to
mr hornaday new york zoo new york city-
he knows from experiments

orient-levant

which is which this may start
something as the terms are more or
less indefinite anyhow mr binda has his
ideas on the subject clear in his mind

  question-would you kindly advise me what
is the difference between the orient and the levant
what countries are included in the orient-ann
millar brooklyn n y

  answer by mr binda-replying to your in-
quiry i would state that the orient is usually
that part of asia south of the himalayas and in-
cluding the malayan islands as far as the philip-
pines also borneo and java that is all the ter-
ritory included between longitude  to  east
and from the equator to about  north the
countries bordering the mediterranean from italy
eastward as well as those running back to the
euphrates and including the coast of syria asia
minor and egypt are known as the levant

  in ancient times the term orient was not used
and that country was then known as the high
levant in common parlance any country east
of suez is known as the orient

big-game counties of wyoming
jots of homestead land there too

  question-i feel that you would be kind enough
to answer a query in regard to wyoming find an
addressed envelop enclosed

  i am a soldier at present but contemplate leaving
the service with two other young men and going to
some section of wyoming and take homesteads
could you tell me the best section of the state to go
to where we could make money trapping and hunt-
ing while we are proving up on the homesteads
i would also like all information you could give me
about the requirements for taking a homestead-
cpl c e brackin camp travis texas

 answer by mr middleton-park lincoln and
fremont counties are the three big-game counties
of wyoming and as you inquire about hunting and
trapping i believe any of these counties would suit
you although i must caution you not to expect to
get rich at trapping one can make a little side
money at it tis true but i am afraid it would prove
to be a pretty slim living

  there is still plenty of land up there open to
homestead entry i would certainly advise you
fellows to go up and look the country over tis
quite a stock country and you could undoubtedly
get all the work you wanted during the summer
months in normal times and at the same time be
proving up on your homesteads

  the requirements to make entry under the home-
stead law are not many one must be a citizen of the
united states or have declared his intention of
becoming such or be the head of a family one who
has arrived at the age of eighteen and has served
honorably in the army or navy is also qualified

  to tell you all there is to be said that is of interest
to the prospective homesteader would take a lot of
space and then it would not all be told write to
mr chas s hill commissioner at state capital
bldg cheyenne wyo for literature concerning
homesteading he will cheerfully fix you out

  you might also write mr c m cox cody wyo
and mr e p perry torrington wyo for lands
in their territory but my advice is to take a trip
there work in different localities and get an idea of
just where you want to take a homestead this
northwest wyoming is sure a big country and
theres a lot of opportunities left for a hustler

  if i can be of any further assistance dont be
afraid to come again

other baits for channel cat

as the fellow said about the other kind
- of cat there are more ways of killing
it than choking it to death with butter

 question-will you please tell me some good
baits for channel catfish besides live minnows-
l grant joplin mo

 answer by mr thompson-if you have had
no luck with the baits you used try mussels craw-
fish large tadpoles or cheese dough keep bait
down at the bottom of stream even at night when
they are out feeding in the shallow water

the maxim silencer

tn his answer to another inquirer mr

   wiggins describes the maxim silencer as
a cylindrical device screwed on the muzzle
of the rifle which contains fins so shaped
that the gases generated by the explosion
are given a centrifugal action thats how
they lose their momentum and momentum
in this case means noise

  question-i expect to go hunting this fall and 
as i have never bought any kind of firearms al-
though i have used some a little i am asking your
advice

  i have heard about the maxim silencer for rifles
do you think it would eliminate the noise where
does the noise come from-the end of the barrel or
from the chamber or cylinder on a revolver what
about a rifle

  if the cartridge is enclosed as in a repeater  or
- does the fact that it is enclosed force the
noise up on through and out of the barrel

  does a - revolver take a - rifle shell
has a - revolver more shocking-power than
a  caliber a - rifle more than a -

  what make rifle - or - is best and what
will it cost

  do you know how a derringer works i mean the
kind you read about in fiction that gamblers used
to use and pull them from their sleeves

  where could one be bought and for how much
how much practise would it take to get the trick
of pulling it out of your sleeve down pat or is it
all hot air

  what is the difference between a double-action
and a single-action revolver-merrill perry
tacoma wash

  answer by mr wiggins-the maxim silencer is
adapted to rifles and single-shot pistols but not to
revolvers or automatic pistols the gases are slowed
down in their velocity by the silencer and are then
passed out of the muzzle in the customary man-
ner the noise is greatly reduced but some
remains

  yes the - revolvers shoot the regular -
or  w c f cartridges and are more powerful
than the  s  w cartridges but less so than the
 specials or -s

  the - rifles are a low-power arm and far less
powerful than the -s

  there is only one - made now the win-
chester its a good rifle the - is made by rem-
ington savage and winchester and are all good
guns the choice being merely one of personal pref-
erence

  i have heard some persons used to carry derringers
in their sleeves retained by an elastic cord and when
the arm was thrown downward by a jerk the pistol
slid down the sleeve to where the hand could grasp it

i presume five years steady practise would make
a man proficient in this stunt the users were
mostly killed by men who wore a  single-action
colt low down on the right leg and drew er a-
smokin

  the double-action revolver is one in which puffing
the trigger will both cock and fire the revolver the
single action is one in which the hammer must be
cocked by the thumb for each shot
